Thor: Ragnarok
Bold and outrageous

One thing which strikes you about Taika Waititi’s ‘Thor: Ragnarok’ is the uniqueness of how the story unfolds. More vibrant than its two prequels, and combined with a quirky sense of humour, it reunites us with two larger-than-life superheroes - Thor and the Hulk. From the outset, it’s evident how well these two play with, and against each other, continuing their love-hate bromance established in the first ‘Avengers’ film.
Following the events of Age of Ultron and Thor: The Dark World, the titular God of Thunder searches for his missing father, Odin, who was discreetly overthrown by Thor’s trickster brother Loki and dumped on Earth. Upon finding him, however, Thor and Loki must contend with the newly awakened Hela, the Goddess of Death and Odin’s secret firstborn. See, she helped conquer the Nine Realms with Odin eons ago, but was promptly discarded and imprisoned once Odin found her too hawkish for Asgard’s good; now released, Hela plans to take back the throne, overpowering Thor and Loki and throwing them out into space
Waititi’s trademark style of comedy is evident in every frame and dialogue. It translates very well onto the screen in all the performances from the ensemble cast. Considering that the odds are stacked against him, Thor is challenged in a way that brings a whole new side to the God of Thunder. Chris Hemsworth get the opportunity to challenge himself sans his powerful axe which is destroyed by his sister Heal. The scenes between Mark Ruffalo and Thor are captivating to watch and will leave you wanting more. Tom Hiddleston is up to his usual charming mischief as Loki. Newcomer Tessa Thompson proves her acting prowess as the spirited and feisty Valkyrie. Jeff Goldblum and Cate Blanchett stand out in the scene. Marvel has brought forth its first female villainess in Hela and she does not cease to disappoint us. The action is fast paced and gripping. There is not a moment for us to become bored by gazing at the screen. Though the scenes are a mixture of comedy and the serious, the dialogs do not stoop to slapstick comedy.
It is a wonder that Marvel managed to outshine ‘Wonder Woman’ but with ‘hor: Ragnarok’ Waititi bhas managed to accomplish this deed.
