Large quantity of narcotic drugs seized

Bogawanthalawa Police raided a shop in Bogawanthalawa town and seized 20 tins of the prohibited narcotic drug ‘NC’ neatly hidden behind a statue of a deity kept in the premises for daily religious observances, on September 17.
The raid followed information that the shop was engaged in rollicking business selling narcotics in the plantation sector targeting schoolchildren and youth. Investigations revealed that a wide network was in operation to sell the banned NC narcotic drug smuggled from Pakistan in the estate sector.
