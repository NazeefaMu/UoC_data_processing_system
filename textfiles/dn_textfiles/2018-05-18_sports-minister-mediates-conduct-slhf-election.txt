Sports Minister mediates to conduct SLHF election

Sports Minister Faiszer Mustapha has directed the National Olympic Committee (NOC) of Sri Lanka to conduct the Sri Lanka Hockey Federation (SLHF) election which was not held for nearly three years.
According to the mediation made among the rival parties in the Appeal Court case no 286/2015, an Election Committee comprising Sports Development Department Director General as the head along with three NOC members and two Sports Development Department officials has to conduct the election.
Within 12 days after assuming duty, the Sports Minister made arrangements to unite rival parties and request them to give their maximum support to conduct the 2018-2020 SLHF election as soon as possible. Minister Mustapha directed NOC yesterday under the provisions of 39-1 of Sports Law no. 25/1973 to conduct the election.
Due to the election not being held, the national governing body for hockey had malfunctioned for nearly three years. Former Sports Minister Naveen Dissanayake in a Very Special Gazette No.1916/36 bestowed the SLHF duties to Sports Development Director General on May 29, 2015.
The election will be held as soon as the election committee is appointed under the instructions of the Attorney-General's Department.
