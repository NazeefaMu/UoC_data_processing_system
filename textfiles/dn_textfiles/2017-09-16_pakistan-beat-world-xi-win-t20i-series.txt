Pakistan beat World XI to win T20I series

LAHORE: Pakistan beat World XI by a thumping 33 runs in the final Twenty20 Friday to clinch a three-match series which marked the return of international cricket to the country.
Set a target of 184 to win, the World XI only managed 150-8 at Lahore's Gaddafi Stadium to concede the series to the home team by 2-1.
David Miller and Thisara Perera scored 32 each while Hasan Ali took 2-28.
Pakistan opener Ahmed Shehzad had earlier missed his second Twenty20 international century when he fell for 89. His 55-ball knock included eight fours and three sixes.
Babar Azam made a 31-ball 48 with five boundaries and added 102 for the second wicket with Shehzad.
Pakistan won the first match by 20 runs on Tuesday before the World XI fought back with a seven-wicket victory on Wednesday to set up Friday's decider.
There were terrific scenes in Lahore following Pakistan’s victory. The fans were happy, the dressing room was happy and the coach Mickey Arthur ecstatic.
Pakistan came up with a terrific display of death bowling.
Shortly after the match Pakistan captain Sarfraz Ahmed calls his boys into a huddle does all the talking before his boys roar in delight.
Pakistan came into this series as favourites and have played like one. The euphoria has carried on from their Champions Trophy win.
The World XI weren't any pushovers. There was some serious pedigree in there, but Pakistan have dominated in conditions familiar to them.
