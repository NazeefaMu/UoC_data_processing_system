Sri Lankans would rather forget this day : Sri Lanka-South Africa World Cup Quarter final-18 March 2015

 The day started bright with clear blue sky and a hint of rain clouds gathering far away. Outside the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG), spectators with Sri Lankan and South African flags were wending their way towards the gate. At the time we got to the venue, about half an hour before the start, our flags were outnumbering the Proteas flags. Everyone seemed happy and excited having great expectations of their respective teams. There were vehicles of all shapes and sizes near the car park full of our supporters who had travelled all the way from Melbourne and Canberra. I flew to Sydney from Melbourne the previous night and was on our way to the SCG with some friends of mine. We were all kitted up for the event with Sri Lankan T-shirts and hats and caps. We were to meet with some more of my friends near Gate C, each of us fervently hoping for a Sri Lankan win. However this seemed to be a tall order.
As we got off after parking the car, we saw a couple unpacking their match goodies from their vehicle, since they looked like South African fans I asked them “what do you think - will we be going home happy or will they be going back happy.” The elderly lady with a sweet smile replied, “We will be happy anyway dear. We are Australians and come to watch good cricket.” After the match I felt bad when I thought about that couple for I felt for once that our Sri Lankan team has let them down. That lady’s comment summed up how most of us felt coming for the match. Even though no one was sure what the result would be, everyone expected to watch quality cricket going by the recent performance of both teams. Unfortunately it was not to be.
The atmosphere even outside the ground was festive with the ‘papere band’ going full swing with young fans singing and having a great time. There were smiles everywhere and people speaking without listening and joking with total strangers. While going to our seats I spotted many friends who have come from Melbourne. Unlike at the MCG here at the SCG I found the spectators to be evenly spread, even though there were different pockets of Sri Lankans and South Africans fans. In Melbourne at the MCG, Bay 13 is the place to be for Sri Lankans; starting from Bay 13 Sri Lankans seems to occupy the area on either side of it. Here in Sydney they seemed to be more evenly spread right around the stadium.
When it came on the Big Screen at the grounds that Sri Lankan captain Angelo Mathews had won the toss and had elected to bat, there was a roar from the crowd with waving of Sri Lankan flags. Sadly for Sri Lanka that was to be the only high point for the rest of the day. Obviously no one new this at the time and our spirits were high although no one has consumed any spirits at the time! The singing of the National Anthem tends to evoke emotion and a sense of pride of your country, when you live abroad than listening to it while you are on home soil. It was no different for us when the National Anthems were played at the SCG. Especially at the cricket matches the National Anthem I believe brings about your patriotism and awareness of ones origin to the fore.The South African National Anthem which had verses sung in Swahili, Afrikaans and English had a beautiful tinge to it. As we sat down after the National Anthems my recently acquired friend Lilith who was next to me, mentioned how nice it would be if a Tamil verse too was added or included in the Sri Lankan anthem. I couldn’t agree with him more. If I may venture to air my view I firmly believe such a gesture would make all the ethnic groups in Sri Lanka feel inclusive, as not only our nation, but our sporting and other teams have reflected the inclusiveness of all ethnic groups at all times.
Sri Lanka succumbs to Pakistan
The win against India a few days back, looked like “a flash in the pan.” Sri Lankan’s were going at a canter with Dickwella and Mathews settling down to a nice rhythm. However as it happens, both were out one after the other and the score stood at 161 for 3. At this moment in time the Cardiff wicket came to life and the ball started to move and lift and Junaid and Amir made the ball talk. The Lankan batsmen were no match for them. Chandimal again played down the wrong line and got castled, for some unknown reason he is having a dismal tour and it is having a telling effect on the team as a whole. Our fielding too let us down badly; they looked to be too eager and nervous and were disappointing. Even at the latter stages, although we fought back, they dropped Sarfraz Ahmed, Thisara Perera dropping a dolly at mid-on. So ended the champion stakes for Sri Lanka but they performed better than expected.
