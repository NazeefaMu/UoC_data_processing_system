Healthy environment for early childhood development

Kids in Action (KIA) is a one of a kind pre-school and day care institution which caters specifically to children aged between 2.5 to 4 years. With branches located in Colombo, Pannipitiya, Nugegoda as well as the newly opened branch in Kaduwela, KIA offers a home away from home for young children, bringing peace of mind to busy parents living and working in Colombo and its suburbs.
Being well versed in child psychology and care, KIA’s specially trained and experienced staff are capable of managing very young children and tending to their needs. Kids In Action has developed a well-balanced, child-centric curriculum designed to bring out the best in these children. The curriculum also includes activities like singing, dancing, music and arts and crafts, providing a conducive environment for a child’s holistic growth.
Parents are ensured that their children are taken care of at a safe, modern and reputed centre by well-versed experts in childcare. Children feel at home in the clean, airy and child-friendly centre, surrounded by the nurturing care and love of the teachers and child care authorities at the Kids in Action centre.
The spacious centres allow children to freely move around and play to their hearts content. Through fun-filled yet carefully curated activities, children not only learn to interact with their peers, but also receive an ideal opportunity to develop skills and talents from an early age. KIA’s Colombo centre offers swimming lessons at the centre’s own swimming pool located within the premises, while the Pannipitiya centre offers a spacious outdoor area to inculcate the habit of environmental care.
KIA centres also provide special day care facility under its ‘Toddler Care’ centre. At Toddler Care, each child is given personalized attention and great care in line with their development stage, so as to provide maximum protection while boosting their gradual development. Toddlers get to engage in a host of lucid yet highly interactive and interesting activities that help them learn new things effortlessly while learning to interact with peers and make the most of their time while being away from home.
