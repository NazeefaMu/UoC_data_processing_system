London Fashion  Week to  feature robots

The wave of sustainability has gripped the UK fashion industry. After the Riccardo Tisci’s “new” Burberry swore to boycott animal fur for the coming seasons, the British Fashion Council has also promised that London Fashion Week for Spring Summer 2019, slated to happen in September, will not show any animal fur as most designers are going fur-free.
This makes London Fashion Week the first of the major fashion events to go fur-free!
Apparel Resources reports, this decision was taken after a recent BFC survey that gave the conclusion that none of the designers are going to use fur in the collections they will showcase next week at the fashion week. Chief Executive of BFC, Caroline Rush says, “The move “highlights a trend we have seen over the past few years, with more and more brands deciding to use alternative materials to fur.”
The council collectively released a statement that said, “The BFC survey results reflect a cultural change based on ideals and choices made by designer businesses, international brands as well as consumer sentiment but also encouraged by the stance of multi-brand stores who are moving away from selling fur.”
This survey was done as part of Positive Fashion initiative of the BFC, which aims to support the best practices of the industry and encourage change for better, under the pillars of sustainability, equality and diversity, and craftsmanship and community.
“This is a pivotal moment in the demise of the cruel fur trade,” said Wendy Higgins, the organization’s director of communications. “It sends out a clarion call of compassion to the other fashion weeks in New York, Paris and Milan to similarly take a bold ethical stance, and it challenges too those designers still using fur to re-examine their morals. Fur cruelty is no longer welcome on the catwalk at London Fashion Week.”
The spring summer 2019 edition of LFW will be a beacon for innovation and sustainability as it will also see the debut of robotic models for the very first time on the runways. Honee, the Los Angeles–based designer is collaborating with Silicon Valley’s OhmniLabs and Kambria for this cutting edge involvement of robots as models as their label, The House of Honee, will have 22 human models and four robotic counterparts. The event is scheduled for Sept. 15 at the Millennium Gloucester London Hotel.
The London Fashion Week is scheduled from 14th to 18th September, 2018.
