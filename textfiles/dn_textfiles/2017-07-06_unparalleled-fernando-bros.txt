The unparalleled  Fernando Bros

They were the talk in sports circles in the country in the 1960s. Three brothers who made waves with their stick artistry and three coaches the likes of which will never ever be seen again.Sad that the rare achievement of the FERNANDO brothers went unheralded, unrecognized and unsung.
They hailed from the green, white and green school St.Benedict’s College, Kotahena from which proud school hails the writer too. The three brothers were ‘SPORTS LEGENDS’ unparalleled.
I am referring to firstly to the three brothers who were a rare breed the likes of which will never or be seen again – the FERNANDOS – STANLEY, HOMER and SUBASH. They were magicians with the curved wand on the hockey field, not only locally but internationally too. And their natural stick work was watched and soaked in awe. They were to Sri Lanka what the great Dhyan Chand was to India when India ruled the hockey world.
Rewrote the record books
In fact the three FERNANDO brothers rewrote the hockey and all sports record books by being the only three brothers to represent the country, a record never before achieved in any world sport when they proudly sported the Sri Lankan jerseys dribbled for the country at the Asian Games in Bangkok in 1966. This is an achievement that should have found a spot in the GUINNESS BOOK of records.
Before going on to dwell and sing hosannas firstly on the FERNANDO BROTHERS, I would like to nudge Old Benedictines and sports fans and reminisce on the excellence of three coaches who were second to none – ALBERT FERNANDO (SOCCER), RAM SUNTHERALINGAM (BASKETBALL) and BRIAN ASSEY (HOCKEY). They made the school and the country proud. Oh for the likes of them now. (About the three coaches in the ‘SPORTS LEGENDS’ columns to follow).
The FERNANDO brothers were a connoisseurs delights to watch. From a very early age STANLEY showed captaincy material in him and it came as no surprise when he captained the school, the Old Bens and then achieving the dream of every sportsman, that of captaining the country.
Generalissimo on the field
Paying in the arduous position of centre half, he was the generalissimo on the field. He led by example. He dished out some canny passes to his strikers and would be back in flash when having to defend. He was always pushing his team mates to give that extra bit, even when the chips were down and his mates would oblige ungrudgingly because they respected and admired his leadership.
STANLEY was a stickler for discipline. Be it his two brothers or other team mates he would lay down the rules and that was it. Be it practice or match, punctuality he steadfastly enforced. No excuses were tolerated be it when he led the school, the club or the country. They respected him because he earned it by example.
HOMER was a stunning left extreme. He was born with a speedy pair of legs, that would have been the envy of the best pf sprinters.
He had amazing stick work. With ball glued to his wand he would dash down the wing dribbling past the defenders and send in some superb passes for his strikers and he even earned the plaudits from the world champions of hockey, the Indians, when they played here in the early 1960s.
SUBASH the third of the four brothers – the last being SARATH who did not have the hockey blood of his brothers in him – was a centre par excellence. He was blessed with the rare flair from the time he held the stick and he would breach any defence with magical dribbling and what a treat and joy he gave those watching and heartbreak to his opponents and the many winning goals he scored were stunning and still vivid in the writer’s mind.
The three brothers lived a stone’s throw away from the school ground at Bloemendhal Road, Kotahena are sadly no more. It would be an admirable gesture of gratitude and goodwill if the school authorities even at this late stage get the authorities to name that lane ‘FERNANDO LANE’.
Fame and honour
This is being urged considering the world record and the fame and honour they brought to the game, the school, the club and the country by being the first set of siblings of brothers to play for the country – something never before or ever likely to be equaled or surpassed. St.Benedict’s College and the Sri Lanka Hockey Federation please take note.
That was also the era when the St. Benedict’s College gave to the game six players who represented the country at the same time. To name them – Stanley Fernando, Homer Fernando, Subash Fernando, Anthony McIntyre, AssissiNattar and BatchoSelvaraj. No school or club can lay claims to this achievement.
The FERNANJDO brothers were fortunate in having a hockey crazy uncle in WALTER who also formed the United Youngsters Hockey Club and showed and taught his three nephews all about the game, which they took to like ducks to water and made them rewrite the record books. They were later coached by BRIAN ASSEY.
Father shed tears of joy
The FERNANDO brothers were the siblings of Joseph Agapit father and mother Soosai Therese who were their guiding lights and father would always be present be it a school, club or international match unobtrusively watching his proud sons perform. Living in the neighbourhoodAgapit met me the day his sons created the record, shed tears of joy and thanked me for the publicity given them which made them go places.
I can vouch for these facts because during that golden and glorious Benedictine era of sport I covered sports for both the Times and the Daily Mirror.
It is not late for the Benedictine family which last year celebrated the school’s 150th anniversary to go down memory lane and recognize, appreciate and honour their outstanding sportsmen. The Old Bens Sports Club which had a surfeit of trophies won by these sportsmen par excellence must take the lead in this aspect.
The FERNANDO brothers will remain monuments in Sri Lankan sport. Their guru was the famous Bro. Mathias assisted by Leslie Figurado.
