Monks collecting money by pindapatha against Vinaya Pitaka: Minister Amunugama

Special Projects Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama said that to his knowledge, the ‘Vinaya Pitakaya’ (Code of Conduct) does not permit bhikkhus to go on pindapatha rounds for collecting money. Bhikkhus doing pindapatha rounds to solicit rupees and cents was not a solitary trend from the angle of the sasana and he thoroughly regretted the practice undertaken by a section of the bhikkhus.
Dr. Amunugama was speaking to the media after participating in a ceremony held at the Galagedara Primary School on September 18.
Dr. Amunugama said that contrary to opposition claims, the country’s economy had registered a growth rate of 5 percent last year.
“An economic down turn had been a habitual allegation levelled against the Government by opposition parties since independence. The correct management of the economy had enabled the Government to handle debt servicing prudently,” he said.
“It was an irony to see Bandula Gunawardena, who claimed that a normal family could make ends meet with a meager Rs. 2,500 income per month, taking the role of economic advisor of the Joint Opposition. While in opposition, Bandula Gunawardena had gained notoriety claiming on economic downturn of the country and countering such baseless allegations would be an utter waste of valuble time,” he said.
