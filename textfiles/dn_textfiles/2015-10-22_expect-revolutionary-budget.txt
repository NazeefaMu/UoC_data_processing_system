Ravi tells private sector
Expect a revolutionary budget

Sectors of the economy will be opened enabling the private sector as well to play an equal role with the government, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said yesterday.
He said for the first time in history, a separate department will be created at the Finance Ministry for private sector development from January 1, 2016.
The Finance Minister was the chief guest at an interactive forum with the key private sector establishments.
"Many sectors in the economy will be opened. The financial sector will need a radical change where we expect the banks to take the risk and move forward for the betterment of the economy under a new era where both the President and the Prime Minister have a clear mandate and vision for it," Karunanayake said.
The minister reminded the private sector that when they forward a challenge to the government they should be ready to meet that challenge. He told them not to live on the dead past as the government has rooted out corruption and the lethargic attitude that existed in the past.
The minister allaying the fears of red tape and lethargic attitude said to be apart of the public sector invited the private sector chambers entrepreneurs to bring any such issues to the immediate attention of the Finance Ministry without making generalised allegations. "If the government is corrupt, don't make mere allegations, tell us where it is then we will change it."
Help us to help you was the call by the minister to the private sector chambers.
The minister said the country will see a revolutionary budget on November 20, where the monopolistic approach of the government will be reduced with competitive element emerging with a level playing opportunity given to all stake holders.
