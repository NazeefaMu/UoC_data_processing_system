Policy decision made on absorbing health workers

A policy decision has been made to absorb health workers who have completed 180 days of work into the permanent carder, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, he has failed to implement some decisions made by him due to the bureaucracy which exists within the Health Ministry. The bureaucracy hinders the forward march of the health service, the Minister said.
He was addressing the Health Trade Unions’ May Day celebration held at the Jayewardene Centre in Colombo yesterday.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that some officials are similar to that of parasites. Their contribution towards the advancement of the health sector is minimal, he said. “Decisions are made after discussions with trade unions and once those decisions are implemented, I take the responsibility,” he said.
After making decisions, trade union leaders and trade unionists have to go after health officials and beg them to implement the decisions. The bureaucracy should be defeated. All health workers should be provided with training and a valid certificate. Promotions should be given on talent, the Minister added.
