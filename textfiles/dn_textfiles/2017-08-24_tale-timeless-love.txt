A Tale of Timeless Love

Love, romance and an immortalized love story is the very foundation of Mount Lavinia Hotel. The hotel was witness to a yet another tale of timeless love, as a happy couple celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary.
Swarna and Percy Seneviratne said ‘I do’ at Mount Lavinia Hotel in 1967. 50 years later, they celebrated their Golden Anniversary at the hotel remembering the wonderful memories. The same venue, the cake structure to the settee-back and the same menu price of just 5 Rupees, as 50 years ago was recreated for Percy & Swarna, who says “it was an unforgettable surprise. Our wedding was also on a Monday and we are now celebrating our 50 year Anniversary on a Monday and we are happy to be back at this beautiful hotel today to share the memories and these beautiful moments, now with our children and grandchildren”.
210 years of history, colonial heritage, and the legacy of romance has made Mount Lavinia Hotel a preferred venue for weddings throughout generations. The Management and staff of MLH was thrilled to recreate these memories and a beautiful experience for Percy & Swarna, ones that will be talked about for generations, just like the hotel itself.
