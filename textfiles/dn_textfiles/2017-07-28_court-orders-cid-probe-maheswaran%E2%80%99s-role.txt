Court orders CID to probe Maheswaran’s role

Releasing main suspect in Vidya murder:
Kayts Magistrate M. M. Riyal has instructed the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to investigate how Women and Child Affairs State Minister Vijayakala Maheswaran had allegedly instructed the police to release Mahalingam Shashi Kumar alias Swiss Kumar the main suspect in the Vidya Sivaloganathan murder.
Counsel appearing for former Deputy Inspector General Lalith Jayasinghe informed court that Maheswaran arrived at the place where the main suspect was captured and tied to a electricity post by the residents. The counsel said the State Minister had come to the scene and released him by untying him from the electricity post, without handing him over to the police.
Former Senior DIG Lalith Jayasinghe was earlier arrested on charges of aiding and abetting Kumar’s release.
They also questioned as to why the CID, which was conducting investigations into the former Senior DIG, was not investigating the State Minister. Sivaloganathan Vidya was abducted, gang raped and murdered in Jaffna in 2015.
