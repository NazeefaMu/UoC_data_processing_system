No fear of Malaria in Sri Lanka

 
There is no fear of Malaria spreading in the country, as reported by certain media recently, Acting Director General of Health Services Dr. J. M. W Jayasundara Bandara said.
"A certain type of mosquito larvae were found in some wells during entomological surveys  in the Mannar island  but those mosquitoes do not spread Malaraia,” said Dr.Bandara.
Dr. Bandara further said that representatives from the World Health Organization (WHO) would visit the Mannar island to inspect the wells with mosquito larvae.
Meanwhile medical experts said that the dengue mosquito ( Aedes Aegypti) can spread several other diseases such as Yellow fever Chikungunya, Zika fever, Mayaro and other forms of yellow fever viruses.
