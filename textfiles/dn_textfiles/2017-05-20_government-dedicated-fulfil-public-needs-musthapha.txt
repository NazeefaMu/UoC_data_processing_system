Government dedicated to fulfil public needs: Musthapha

"President Maithripala Sirisena's concept is ‘good governance’. His vision is to support the general public to accomplish their needs while protecting democracy of the country," Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faizer Musthapha said.
He was addressing the gathering after inaugurating two projects to construct bridges in the Nagoda and Yakkalamulla areas in the Galle district.
“The consensual government we have today was appointed by the general public themselves. We too joined hands with President Maithripala Sirisena for the betterment of all. That is why we were able to initiate such rural development projects for you,” he said.
He said that it was essential to uplift the infrastructure in Galle as it is a district supporting the economy of the country. "Deputy Minister Nishantha Muthuhettigama, who is my friend, knows well about the needs of this area and act accordingly without expecting any political benefits.
I will support him in any means to carry out his development procedure," the minister said.
The Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister has allocated Rs. 53 million to construct bridges in Udugama, Aluthwatta, Galle, Kalumada, and Yakkalamulla.
The late minister Amarasiri Dodangoda had pointed out the need for these bridges, but it had been inactive so far. Minister Faiszer Musthapha took immediate steps to provide necessary provisions to initiate the projects, he said.
