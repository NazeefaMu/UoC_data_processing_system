HMD Global launches Nokia 2

HMD Global, the home of Nokia phones, announced the launch of the Nokia 2. Nokia phones are associated with great battery life; today, we announce a smartphone that takes it to a whole new level. With 2-day battery lifei, the Nokia 2 is built to keep going long after other smartphones need recharging.
Its impressive 2-day battery lifei doesnot come at the expense of performance. Combining a Qualcomm Snapdragon Mobile Platform and a 5 inch, high quality display with the pure, secure and up to date AndroidM experience, the Nokia 2 offers technology that you can depend on, all day and every day.
Juho Sarvikas, Chief Product Officer of HMD Global, said, “People rely on their phones so much these days with many people subconsciously rationing their battery life when out and about so they can last the day. We don’t think you should have to do less with your phone which is why we created a smartphone that can power through when other devices need a pit stop.”
Currently the Nokia 3, 5, 6 and modern classic Nokia 3310 are available in Sri Lanka. HMD Global is committed to introduce the latest Nokia phone models as they are launched internationally, through its extensive partner network within the country.
Built to last in every way the Nokia 2 delivers unrivalled durability in design, drawing on all the hallmarks of the Nokia phone heritage of quality, simplicity and reliability. Its sleek frame is precision-machined from a single block of aluminium while Corning® Gorilla Glass is complemented by sculpted polycarbonate on the back delivering both a great feel and the build-quality you expect from a Nokia smartphone.
With an 8MP rear camera featuring automatic scene detection and auto focus, the Nokia 2 ensures you get fantastic shots every time.
