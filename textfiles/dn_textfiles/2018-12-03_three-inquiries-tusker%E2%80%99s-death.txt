Three inquiries into tusker’s death

Three inquiries have been launched into the death of Tusker Mugalan which was killed last week at Udawalawa National Park, Department of Wildlife and Conservation (DWC) Director Chandana Sooriyabandara said yesterday.
“One of the inquiries is being carried out by the DWC under the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance. Another inquiry is being carried out by the Police. The third inquiry is a preliminary investigation by an officer of the DWC to find out operational issues if any,” Sooriyabandara, responding to the Daily News said.
Mugalan, the youngest tusker in Udawalawa National Park, was killed on Saturday (01). According to environmentalists, Mugalan possessed a unique pair of tusks.
Approximately 220 or more elephant deaths have been recorded this year.
