The world  according to  planet Rugby!

As the world rotates on its axis and the spotlight pendulum swings gloriously oblivious of how much we appreciate this game ...all things rugby dominate the globe Sri paradise awoke to nerves and much speculation about the outcome of the Royal v Peter’s clash to decide the Singer League Championship.
All the experts both near and far opting to park it on the fence, given the defending champions unbeaten stat and Peter’s hard fought loss to Joes.
As it turned out ...it was an unforgiving episode in the middle for coach Martis and his bruised Bamba brigade, looking to manufacture that elusive title yet again.
On the day, it was very much the Lewke coalition at Royal College that stayed patient and brushed aside all that Peter’s threw at them.
It was certainly not the hype and rhetoric bandwagon...or was it a Peterite dictate that exhausted the allocated oxygen for the 70 minutes in the middle.
Royal were sharp, consistent, predictable, efficient, remarkably patient with their team specialists...both in attack and especially their defending the goal line.
Good teams dominate play and are a constant threat, irrespective of what is current, in the middle.
Peter’s eventually running out of patience and petrol...gave up their league quest, minus the aggressive running, that kept their Bamba hopes alive ...even after their loss to concrete wall Joseph's.
Mighty was the Royal work rate that piled the points in the second half and outplayed St Peter's 3 to 1.
Royal marching victorious and such a grand team effort from the entire squad. Big hand to all their faithful for a job very well done.
Thank goodness we managed to finish the Singer League championship and deliver the season in style.
Much needs to be sorted and a professional eye to keep the spirit and upgrade the quality for all to enjoy.
The Milo knockouts should be equally lung busting, despite Royal staying away and consequently zero possibilities of anyone beating them.
Well done to Science and Maliyadeva for their step up...next season and enjoy the knockouts this June.
Planet rugby was rotating around the world series whistle stop in Paris for the 7s ...hardly the romantic conclusion sought by our untouchable Fiji islanders?
Instead it was England, New Zealand and South Africa that showed spectacular skills and scintillating pace to break French hearts.
Bet the boys enjoyed the 7s and few loaded Parisian traditions that’s hard to dismiss...plus some new skills for the trip home?
But all is not lost for France as their U20 warriors push defending world champions New Zealand out and March into the final v England this Sunday.
The final will raise history and the rivalry that predates so much between England and France.
Whatever the rhetoric...this French side are tough as nails and at home in another World Cup final. Rest assured the entire French nation will be cheering the boys home and not the faintest hint of coming 2nd.
Locally it's the club 7s on Saturday and Sunday...but minus Kandy, who won the opening leg and are joined by Havelocks as well.....hardly the competitive edge we seek to identify true 7s talent and step them up to the Asian and world standard.
I am hopeful Sri Lanka Rugby will set up our Asian pathway for 7s and be relentless in their criterion for selection.
It is the toughest place on earth to step up and be counted as true 7s islanders...it's a reputation we must earn back by deeds and clinical skills, rather than special invites and colourful rhetoric.
It's no figment that Sri islanders were certainly considered by the elite for skills and courage...a reputation built on years of playing the toughest teams on the circuit.
It was our generation that carved that path and jealously guarded its achievements…and certainly deserve their gladiator tags. Proud islander 7s ...respect gentleman.
Grab the schedules for the impressive lineup of super summer internationals for the most grueling June ever.
