Indonesian  volcano erupts on  tsunami-hit island

INDONESIA: A volcano has erupted on the same central Indonesian island hit by a devastating earthquake and tsunami five days ago.
Mount Soputan, in North Sulawesi province, began spewing ash 6,000 metres (19,600 feet) into the sky on Wednesday morning.
Authorities warned about the risk to planes from volcanic ash in the air. A huge aid operation is under way on the island for survivors with no access to electricity or running water.
It comes after at least 1,340 people are known to have died after a 7.5-magnitude quake struck just off the island on Friday, triggering a tsunami that engulfed the coastal city of Palu.
The volcanic eruption status was raised from an alert to standby 2.5 miles from the summit of Mouth Soputan. Standby status means the public should avoid the area nearest the volcano and have masks available in the event of ashfall. No evacuations were immediately ordered, but planes were warned of the ash clouds because volcanic ash is hazardous for engines. Mount Soputan is located about 900km north-east of the quake-ravaged region and there were no immediate reports of any casualties from the volcanic eruption.
President Joko Widodo headed back to the quake-affected areas for a second time on Wednesday to supervise rescue and relief operations as reports of mass looting of food and other goods emerged. The death toll may rise, as rescuers are unable to extricate people suspected to be buried under buildings that collapsed due to liquefaction, a phenomenon that causes soil to lose its strength after violent shaking, according to Dr Sutopo. Though Central Sulawesi accounts for only about 1 per cent of the country’s gross domestic product, the reconstruction cost may weigh on the government’s finances as it battles a slump in the currency.
The rupiah weakened past 15,000 per dollar for the first time in 20 years on Tuesday and is down 10 per cent this year.
The quake and volcano may also hurt the nation’s all-important tourism industry, which was rattled by a series of deadly earthquakes on the popular tourist destination of Lombok island, near Bali.
