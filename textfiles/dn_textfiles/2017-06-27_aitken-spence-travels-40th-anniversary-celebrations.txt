Aitken Spence Travels  40th anniversary celebrations

Aitken Spence Travels (AST) held its 40th anniversary in a gala manner at Waters Edge on June 23 graced by the Minister of Special Assignments Dr Sarath Amunugama as the chief guest and the keynote speaker.
Over the last four decades, the brand Aitken Spence has become synonymous with trust, reliability, professionalism and stability.
Aitken Spence PLC Deputy Chairman/Managing Director J M S Brito said that even at turbulent times, the AST team forecasted on opportunities in the marketplace and ventured boldly to places where no one has gone before to develop markets.
“AST is fortunate to have a strategic partner like TUI who has recognized AST as an associate who constantly adds value to the unique relationship with creativity and innovation”, he noted.
AST Managing Director Nalin Jayasundera said due to the leadership taken by the company to position Sri Lanka in the world map as a tourist hub, numbers soared making AST the market leader.
“I pay my gratitude to Aitken Spence PLC Chairman Deshamanya D.H.S. Jayawardena and the board of directors for their continuous encouragement and faith in AST. We achieved an unprecedented 153,000 passengers handled within the last financial year adhering to quality standards pertaining to global travel requirements,” said Jayasundera.
TUI Executive Board Member Sebastian Ebel observed joint ventures flourish when there is trust between partners and the partnership between TUI and AST is testament to it.
TUI Destination Services Managing Director David Schelp said, “In November 1977 AST offered a comfy service to TUI’s customers while they were on holiday in Sri Lanka and that’s when our collaboration started. In 2004 we established a joint venture making AST a member of TUI’s global destination management company network. We added value to this partnership in 2016 by jointly commissioning hotel RIU Sri Lanka in Ahungalla.”
“Being a pioneer in developing new products and having visionary leaders with exceptional entrepreneurial spirit, AST has built great networks both in Sri Lanka and with its global partners,” he added.
Minister Amunugama in his insightful speech said AST with TUI has positioned Sri Lanka as a globally acceptable destination. He said partnership between the two corporate giants is like a marriage made in heaven.
“Loyal tourists are the best ambassadors of Sri Lanka,” said the Minister.
AST’s staff members who have long service records were conferred at the event with accolades.
