New retreading section inaugurated saving millions on Army vehicles

The modern state-of-the-art retreading section in the recently-established Ordnance Factory of the Army at Dombagoda, Horana was inaugurated yesterday by Army Commander Lieutenant General Crishanthe De Silva.
The new tyre retreading section built at a cost of Rs. 14 million is capable of retreading 8,804 vehicle tyres of the Army annually, saving the army Rs. 20.5 million annually. The new section has the capacity to retread 36 tyres daily.The opening of the retreading section in the Ordnance Factory signals a new turning point in the Army’s modernizing and restructuring of its infrastructure facilities, on par with fast changing, innovative prospects and challenging dimensions at global levels. The new section is manned by six officers and 300 other rankers and commanded by Brigadier H.L Guruge, Factory Commandant. After inaugurating the retreading section, the Commander inspected other areas of potential products, in the pipeline, such as new initiatives of shoe production, manufacture of ladies’ hand bags, embroidery production technique for badges, and manufacture of berets flags, etc, still on experimental basis in separate sections inside the Ordnance Factory complex.
The Commander also inspected a display of several factory-manufactured and technically-modified accessories, needed by the Army for regular use. He also inquired into several aspects of production processes of such items while viewing them and encouraged those in charge of those sections to do their best for the organisation since the Army is always ready to help such moves.
The Commander unveiled a symbolic plaque formally opening the new section.
Both the Army Ordnance Factory at Dombagoda and the mega Army Industrial Workshop at Kosgama commenced operations in September 2014 with the objective of producing varieties of hardware, barrack equipment, machinery tools and l other accessories, required for the Army.
The Commander through these projects expects to develop and promote Army skills, innovative creativity, knowledge on modern technology, access to quality products, and provide second career options for hundreds of soldiers through craftsmanship, etc upon their retirement. The project would also save foreign exchange and local costs for the organisation while supplying critical needs of the Army on priority basis. The initial capital Rs 14 million for the project had been allocated by the Master General Ordnance (MGO) branch of the Army through the Directorate of Ordnance Services (DOS) and another Rs 1.4 million had been allocated to purchase raw materials, required for the project.
