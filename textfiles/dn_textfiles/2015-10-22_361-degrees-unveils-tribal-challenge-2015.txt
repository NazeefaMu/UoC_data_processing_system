361 Degrees unveils "Tribal Challenge 2015"

361 Degrees, the leading Human Activations company in Sri Lanka, has organized the Tribal Challenge 2015, a unique competition featuring a tribal-themed outdoor experiential learning programme.
The competition celebrates the company's momentous milestone of completing 1,000 training programmes since its inception back in 2001 as Wild Drift. Additionally, this competition serves as one of several initiatives the company has mapped out to announce that Wild Drift, 361 Edge and 361 Interactive are now collectively known as "361 Degrees".
Through this competition, the 10 winning teams of 4 members each will be provided the opportunity to take part in an all-expense-paid training programme at an exotic location out of Colombo. The winning teams will be selected via radio and Facebook competitions that are currently being carried out while the 'Tribal Challenge 2015' experiential learning programme is to be held on October 31 and November 1. During the programme, the 10 teams will have to face a host of different experiences, such as the Totem Blessing, Tribal War Dance, Diyabariya Challenge, Ball in the Blind Alley, Keep It Straight, Aim Game & Conquer the World.

Rukmal De Silva - Chief Visionary Officer of 361 Degrees
"For the past 14 years, Wild Drift has been leading the way in providing innovative experiential learning solutions tailor-made to meet the needs of a wide variety of clients. We provide participants with a robust, all-round experience which helps provide holistic solutions to a variety of HR-related issues companies face. The Tribal Challenge 2015 serves two purposes - firstly, it was conceptualized to celebrate the 1,000th training programme of the company, and secondly, it is part of a series of activities that we're carrying out to announce that Wild Drift will now be known as 361 Degrees", 361 Degrees Chief Visionary Officer Rukmal De Silva stated. He added that the change was necessary in order to give clients a more integrated and comprehensive training plan that better-catered to individual needs rather than being centred on the particular approach that was taken towards training previously.

"Making employees happy and productive involves 3 crucial areas - competency, passion and congruence. Firstly, you get the issue of competency because if people do not have capabilities, they cannot fulfill their role and neither they nor their bosses will be happy. Then, there are instances where people who have the capabilities and competencies don't fulfill their tasks because they are not passionate about what they do, the company, their role or the culture. The third aspect is that if both competency and passion are present, it has to align with the different aspects of the organization such as culture, processes, strategies, systems and policies. At 361 Degrees, we design and execute holistic solutions which cover all 3 areas", Rukmal stressed.

The year 2014 was another successful year for 361 Degrees as they completed an impressive 180 programmes for over 60 clients. Among the many noteworthy initiatives was a training session for over 500 people with South African cricketing great Gary Kirsten, a two-day programme for 6,000 people and a programme that used theatre as a learning platform for leadership training.
