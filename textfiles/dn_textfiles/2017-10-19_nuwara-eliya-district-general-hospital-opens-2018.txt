Nuwara Eliya District General Hospital opens in 2018

The Nuwara Eliya District General Hospital will be opened in 2018. The hospital scheduled to be opened in 2015 was delayed due to certain issues with some buildings which were re-done by the contractor, Health Ministry spokesman said.
Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne inspected the Nuwara Eliya new District General Hospital constructed at a cost of 39 million Euros recently.
Minister Senaratne instructed the contractor to rectify all the issues presently existing in the construction.
The Minister held discussions in connection with providing required medical equipment and human resources to the hospital. Equipment required for quarters and hostels will be provided.
All state hospitals located in the Nuwara Eliya district will be developed with the financial assistance provided by the Netherlands Government.
