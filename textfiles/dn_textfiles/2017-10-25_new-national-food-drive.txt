The new national food drive

The government recently launched a new food drive with slogans such as atu kotu purawamu (lets fill the garners and farmyards) and “cultivate every inch of crop land”. Surprisingly no mention, whatsoever, was made of the toxin-free agriculture project that was so vigorously promoted by the government in the last two years under the aegis of the Presidential Secretariat and the Strategic Enterprises Management Agency (SEMA). Its leaders were the Chairman of SEMA and Ven. Athuraliya Rathana Thera.
The project which totally bypassed the formal agricultural institutions of the country such as the Department of Agriculture and the Ministry has been a total failure! This is not surprising given its objectives. Further, the glyphosate ban has taken a heavy toll on crop production and the state inaction on phosphate pollution would lead to serious repercussions in the not too distant future.
Organic farming technologies fail
Rice - toxin free or not?
The main thrust of the project was the promotion of agrochemical-free (organic) agriculture and traditional rice varieties in place of the new improved, high yielding varieties. The global crop cover in organic agriculture is a meagre 1% of which two thirds is in pasture. With all effort the project could not even achieve 1% of the total rice lands in the country despite massive promotional efforts of the project because there was not enough organic matter available and two of the alternative technologies employed comprising microbial based fertilizer concoctions failed to promote crop growth and yield. One formulation, “Pivithuru pohora” was promoted among farmers in the Mahaweli system B and the other, Biofilm Biofertilizer (BFBF) in System C.
We met many farmers who had used Pivithuru Pohora in System B, and some of them reluctantly admitted that the fertilizer did not work. Some whispered that three or four weeks after its application, the crop turned yellow, (indicative of nitrogen deficiency) and they secretively applied urea! Secretive because they were to sell their paddy Rs. 5-7 more per kilogram than the guaranteed price as ‘organic paddy’ being purchased by a powerful merchant in the area. Farmers are no fools! Trials conducted at the Aralaganwila Research Station both last Maha and Yala seasons too had not responded to this fertilizer. The other fertilizer, BFBF, prominently displayed in the SEMA website, without reliable experimental evidence as to its efficacy had been promoted among farmers in System B, by a company of which the inventor/researcher, a professor of a state institution, is a shareholder. A similar fate as for Pivithuru Pohora had befallen on this product too!
Traditional rice
The other thrust area of the toxin free project was the cultivation of traditional rice promoted over the new high yielding varieties, in the pretext that they are more nutritious and have also medicinal value. The crux of the matter is that the new varieties yield several times more than the traditional varieties and some of them have comparable nutritional value. The country moved away from the traditional varieties because they were low-yielding (average 1ton/ha), non-fertilizer responsive, lodged when fertilizer was applied and relatively more pest and disease susceptible than the new varieties which were bread against these deficiencies.
The staple food, however, is meant to provide carbohydrates or calories and other nutrition should essentially be obtained from fruits, vegetables, fish and meat. This thrust also met with little or no success. But the sale of traditional varieties is being promoted by the Toxin-Free activists. They are being sold in shops and supermarkets, but the public response has altogether been lukewarm according to the sellers because of the high price which is usually 50 to 100% more than for the usual rice.
There is however no harm in cultivating small extents if there is demand and price compensation for the farmer for the lower yields of traditional varieties. The farmers again are no fools; many of them grow a high yielding new red variety, BW 272-6b very similar to the traditional variety “kurulu thuda” but yields more than double the latter, and sell at double the price of normal rice varieties labelling it as kurulu thuda!
The Glyphosate ban
The writer and many other main stream scientists have over the last two years relentlessly asserted that there is no evidence to implicate glyphosate in the causation of the kidney disease (CKDu) that is plaguing the people of the Rajarata (NCP) and a few neighbouring areas. The WHO - Sri Lanka Expert Consultation that was held in April 2016 too stated in its report that there is no evidence to implicate any role for glyphosate in the aetiology of the disease. Further, a team of professionals appointed by the Prime Minister to investigate and report on the ban had reported that on available evidence the ban should be lifted. The Minister of Plantation Industries had on the basis of that report submitted a cabinet paper seeking the government’s intervention to lift the ban. His concern has mainly been the serious difficulty in controlling weeds in tea in the absence of this chemical or an alternative equally efficacious.
The Planters’ Association has stated that weed competition has reduced tea yields and the losses last year amounted to Rs. 20 billion. However, as per the grape vine, the Minister of Health had, at some Parliamentary meeting remarked that glyphosate is ‘a poison’ and the matter appears to have got stuck there! Surely, can a responsible minister make such a damning utterance without studying the matter in depth! All crops across the board use glyphosate and its unavailability have substantially increased weeding costs, especially in plantations with serious labour shortages. Nowhere else in the world has glyphosate been banned in agriculture. Despite the ban plenty of it is available locally in the black market at three to four times the normal price and farmers are using it freely. Agriculture is thus in shambles due to bad decisions!
Phosphate pollution
It is common knowledge that vegetable farmers in the Upcountry (Nuwara Eliya and Badulla Districts) apply five to ten times the recommended quantities of chemical fertilizer in the mistaken belief that more fertilizer means more crops! On top of the chemical fertilizer, farmers also add 5-10 t/ha of organic matter. Of the chemical fertilizers, the greatest concern is about phosphate derived from soluble triple superphosphate. Organic matter also may contribute to the phosphate pollution. In addition, both the organic and phosphate fertilizers carry heavy metals such as cadmium (Cd), which are toxins, as impurities in minute quantities, which, however can affect human health. There is evidence of marginal Cd build up in the vegetable soils and even in some of the vegetables grown in them, not only in the Upcountry but elsewhere too, which may in the future become a health concern.
Soil analytical evidence from the Department of Agriculture reveals that 50% of the vegetable soils in the Upcountry have phosphorus (P) levels exceeding the critical limit of 60 ppm. In some soils P levels exceeding 400 ppm have been reported. Soil scientists say that nowhere else in the world has such high soil P levels been reported. In many other countries when P levels are high, the farmers have to report them to authorities for a decision on cultivation of the land. The risk is that the P in soils exceeding the said critical level may be washed downstream entering the reservoirs in the lowlands (Rajarata) below, causing algal blooms; and some of the algae secrete toxins which can affect both the liver and kidney. In fact some researchers implicate them in the aetiology of CKDu.
If Glyphosate is a common cold, phosphate pollution is a serious cancer! Dr. Sarath Amarasiri, a former Director General of Agriculture has dealt in depth on this vital issue on many occasions in the media. Sadly, his cries have hitherto fallen on deaf ears.
In conclusion, the government’s new thrust in agriculture should be based on sound policies to be decided in consultation with recognized experts in the field. It has recently appointed an economic commission to deliberate on economic issues and advise the government.
There should be a similar organisation with experts in the various fields for deliberation and advising the government on other national issues relating to development in the lines of the National Planning Commission of India. The name has been changed to the National Technology Commission under Indian Premier Modi. Matters such as the glyphosate ban or ‘toxin – free’ agriculture should have been deliberated by such a body prior to implementation. Had it happened the outcome would certainly have been different. 
Paddy fields being prepared.
