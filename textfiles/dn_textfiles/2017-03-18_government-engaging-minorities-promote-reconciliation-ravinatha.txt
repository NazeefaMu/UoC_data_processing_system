Government engaging with minorities to promote reconciliation: Ravinatha

Sri Lankan permanent representative to the UN in Geneva Ravinatha P. Aryasinha said on Wednesday that Sri Lankan government has been engaging with minorities in order to ensure national unity and reconciliation.
Delivering a statement during the Interactive Dialogue with the Special Rapporteur on Minority Issues, Rita Izsák-Ndiaye, Ambassador Ariyasingha said such steps would improve good governance and development while promoting and protecting human rights.
“The first ever National Integration and Reconciliation Week was observed from January 8 to 14 2017, with all public officials as well as school children taking a pledge, resolving to work together, hand in hand, respecting the richness of our diversity, to foster peace, understand, and mutual trust, for a new Sri Lanka that is united in its diversity,” Aryasinha said.
He noted that the government views culture as an important stepping stone for promoting national reconciliation.
“Culture is viewed in the conceptual framework of building peace as well as national development. Efforts are made to protect and preserve the culture and tradition of all communities and to foster inter-cultural understanding.”
But more work must be done, he said, and added that, since the government has released land and reconstructed over 11,000 houses, there is an array of issues that the government must tackle.
“There are a number of socio-economic issues that need to be addressed such as housing, sanitation, water supply, and other basic facilities and infrastructure including access roads, schools, hospitals and so on to provide durable solutions to the people,” he said. Aryasinha concluded his remarks by thanking Rita Izsák, the Special Rapporteur for Minority Rights, for vising the country.
“Sri Lanka considers its engagement with Special Procedures as an important component of its reconciliation efforts and steps being taken to uphold the human rights of all her citizens,” he said.
