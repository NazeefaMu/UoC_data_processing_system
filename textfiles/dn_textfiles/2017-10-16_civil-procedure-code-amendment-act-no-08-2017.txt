Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Act No. 08 of 2017

(Continued from September 25)
XIV. After all the pre-trial steps are completed (on the parties informing the judge that all the pre-trial steps had been taken and the judge is satisfied that all such pre-trial steps have been taken), the pre-trial judge must call the case within 14 days(two weeks) to fix the date for trial.
§ Sections 146, 147 and 148 of the principal enactment are hereby repealed.
It is important to note that the pre-trial process is a novel feature introduced by the Amendment, which can expedite the trial procedure.
However, a distinctive feature is that, all preliminary steps of the trial procedure are dealt with at the pre-trial stage and the trial judge is vested with the examination of the witnesses.
XV. Concerns relating to the pre-trial procedure
i. The admission and issues are to be filed 14 days prior to pre-trial stage and the pre-trial procedure is to be concluded within three months (postponement of one month).
• Accordingly, steps such as settling of issues, calling for commissions and return thereof, filing list of witnesses, filing interrogatories, discovery of documents, admission of documents and content of documents, identifying witnesses appointing a Court expert, consideration of agreements between parties, calling witnesses if necessary (to determine issues) etc. must be concluded within the specified time as aforesaid, which may cause a practical issues.
• It is too premature for us to gauge whether the impact in all of those steps referred to above could be concluded within a period of three months, particularly in view of provisions for calling commissions which generally take a period beyond three months.
ii. Furthermore, the Amendment does not provide provisions relating to the following;
• Filing of list of witnesses and documents prior to the pre-trial procedure. (Section 121 of the CPC)
• Service of interrogatories (Chapter XVI)
· The mode admission/ exchange of documents ( although provisions have been set out for admission of the content of the documents)
iii. The Amendment does not facilitate Provisions for Computer (Evidence Special Provisions) Act No 14 of 1995.
iv. Section 149 A (1) and (2) empowers a pre-trial Court to order, consolidate actions which may result in expeditious conclusion of action; however, it is subject to the agreement by the parties, which may nullify the effect of the provisions.
8. Consolidation of actions
Consolidation of actions is dealt with in terms of the Section 149A.
Where two or more actions in which the questions of law or fact in issue are substantially the same,
i. Court can consolidated - upon terms as the court may deem fit and on the agreement of parties. (149A. (1))
ii. The Court may order,
• Where there is the same evidence, several actions to be tried at the same time
• the evidence in one action to be used as evidence in another,
• one of several actions to be tried and other actions to be stayed to abide by the result, with the consent of the parties.
However, in the above circumstances, on the application of any party the court shall have power to try one of the other actions so stayed where the selected action fails to be a real trial of the issues involved.
9. Affidavit evidence
Under the new Act, with the insertion of Section 151A provisions have been set out for Affidavit evidence, accordingly;
Court can on its own motion or at the request of one of the parties order affidavit evidence from a witness to be substituted for an oral examination in chief of a witness.
• However, such affidavit shall be tendered on a date fixed by the Court at least one month priorto the date of the trial.
• The affidavit must be tendered together with the documents referred to the Registrar of the Court with the proof of service of a copy.
• On the date of the trial;
1. The affidavit and the documents should be produced through the witness
2. The opposing party is entitled to object to its being received, either on the inadmissibility of such evidence/inadmissibility or authenticity of any documents annexed
3. then court may make a ruling on such objection, prior to cross examination provided that in appropriate circumstances, permit the leading of oral evidences, in addition to the evidence contained in the affidavit
4. hearsay or any matter which is scandalous can be deleted by court and proceed with the rest of the matter
