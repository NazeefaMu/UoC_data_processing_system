Mobile services by UDA to mark anniversary

Measures have been taken by the UDA to conduct a special mobile service on June 18 from 10 am to 6 pm under the patronage of Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka, concurrent to the UDA’s 40th anniversary celebrations.
Solutions pertaining to building construction, the division of land into plots and approvals, resolving of basic plans, issuance of compliance certificates and provision of solutions to development certification issues will be done during the service.
The UDA will be taking measures to issue the certifications pertaining to development conforming to modern standards and technology. Through this new online system, an applicant could apply for the relevant documentation and approval will be granted from the UDA from anywhere in the world. The UDA’s intention is to make their services more efficient and less time-consuming.
Through the social and physical development coordination of the development areas identified by the minister, the UDA, which was established by the 1978 Parliamentary Act No. 41, intends to conduct an unprecedented service to the country.
In their approach to streamline urban development, the UDA intends to resolve issues pertaining to the preparation of development plans and prepare investment facilities. It also aims to resolve issues pertaining to development and related fields of urban population and resolve issues pertaining to other UDA affiliated institutions as well. This is a service to uplift the living standards of the urban population and also an investment for future generations.
The provision of solutions to issues related to urban development is a process involving rules and regulations. In some instances, although the UDA can provide direct solutions to problems faced by the urban community, in other instances, they have to work in collaboration with other affiliated institutions in providing solutions. To resolve this matter, Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka has instructed the UDA to device a mechanism where the UDA goes to the people to provide solutions to their issues instead of having the people come to them.
Therefore, in addition to the 13 Local Government institutions representing the Colombo district, officials from the Water Supply and Drainage Board, Ceylon Electricity Board, Central Environmental Authority, Agriculture Services Authority, Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Cooperation, Coast Conservation Department, Irrigation Corporation and the representatives of the Divisional Secretariats will be attending the mobile service.
