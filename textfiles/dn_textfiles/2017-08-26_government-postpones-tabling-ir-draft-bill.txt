Government postpones tabling of IR draft bill

The proposed new Inland Revenue Act is consistent with the constitution and has been amended as per the determination of the Supreme Court said State Minister of Finance Eran Wickramarathne.
The new inland revenue draft bill that was due to be submitted to parliament today (25), but the government had decided to postpone tabling it until September 07.
Addressing the media yesterday at the Government Information Department, Minister Wickramarathne said the main objective of the new Inland Revenue Bill was to simplify the tax system in the country in order to create an investor friendly environment that will attract more foreign direct investments in the near future.
“The Bill aims to reduce the indirect taxes levied from the people from 80 percent to 60 percent and increase the direct taxes from 20 percent to 40 percent within three years,” he said.
Minister Wickremarathne said the Inland Revenue Act will not affect the normal people and the professionals who earn more than Rs 100,000 would be subject to pay a tax.
He said that the new government inherited an unstable economy and now they have been able to stabilize the economy.
“The government is in the process of reforming the system to create a strong foundation for the future. We have been able to successfully bring down the instability in the economy which was the budget deficit. As a part of that reform we have been able to raise government revenue from a low level of 11.5 percent of GDP to a 14.5 percent of GDP within this short period of time. In an attempt to increase our exports which has fallen drastically over the last decade and a half from 34 percent of GDP to 14-15 percent of GDP, we have taken a decision that the Sri Lankan exchange rate should reflect the market forces,” he said.
Minister Wickramarathne said the reserves in the country have gone up from USD 5 Billion to USD 7 Billion and added that the government expects USD 400 Million and by next year another USD 600 – 700 Million from the Hambantota port.
He further said that new investments will come in the next 24 months and that would change the economic scenario of the country.
“We have not had a new bill for a long period, there were amendments but never actually presented a comprehensive new bill. Simple language has been used and that would make it much easier to see how the tax system operates. We have done it in a very transparent manner and had discussions with all stake holders including the trade unions,” he said. Minister Wickramarathne affirmed that they have incorporated the suggestions presented by the trade union and that will be presented as amendments in Parliament along with the bill.
He said the government has brought down the cost of single cab, double cab and demo vehicles by Rs 300,000 to strengthen the small and medium scale businessmen.
When asked whether the indirect tax which is around 82 percent would be reduced under the new bill, Minister Wickramarathne said that they expect it to be reduced and added that the motive of the government is to reduce the indirect tax that is being levied.
Responding to a question raised by a Journalist whether taxes would be introduced on statutory benefits such as EPF/ETF, he said that there will not be any changes to the earlier procedure and it will remain the same.
