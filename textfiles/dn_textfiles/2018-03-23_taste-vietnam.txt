A taste of Vietnam

‘A Taste of Vietnam’, Vietnamese food promotion is now being held at the Hilton, Colombo. The promotion will end on March 31. It's indeed a flavourful explosion with one pod of authentic Vietnamese Cuisine, especially prepared by Hilton's very own Vietnamese Chef Khac Huan. A sensational array of delicacies from the Far East will delight the taste buds of food lovers with a rich blend of exotic flavours, textures and colours.
Here are some mouth-watering dishes captured by our staff photographer Shan Rambukwella at the opening night.
