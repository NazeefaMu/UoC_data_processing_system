‘SLFP and UPFA have hung on Elephant’s tail’

National Freedom Front Propaganda Secretary Mohamed Muzammil yesterday charged that the SLFP and UPFA have hung on the Elephant’s tail ignoring the anti-UNP votes received to them at the Local Government election.
Addressing the media yesterday at NFF party office in Pita Kotte, Muzammil said that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) engaged in an anti-UNP at the Local Government election campaign and both parties received anti-UNP votes.
During the election campaign, they also claimed that they did not want to continue the national government and they asked people to cast their votes to form a SLFP government.
He was commenting on statements by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera in Parliament on Wednesday, which claimed that the agreement between the United National Party and Sri Lanka Freedom Party forming the national government is still valid and will continue to function.
He further charged that the yahapalana government had led the country towards destruction during past three years.
