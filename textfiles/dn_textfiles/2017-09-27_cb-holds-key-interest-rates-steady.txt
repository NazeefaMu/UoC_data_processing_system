The Standing Deposit Facility Rate will be held s at 7.25%, Standing Lending Facility Rate at 8.75% and Statutory Reserve Ratio will remain at 7.5%, he said.
“The Monetary Board also observed that several risks that were observed at the beginning of the monetary tightening cycle have subsided. However the Board noted that some risks still prevail,” he said.
In the first half of 2017, there was an upward adjustment in all market interest rates. But after the first half, so far during the year, there has been a decline in short-term market interest rates, particularly in call money market rates.
With improvements in the government securities market, it was observed that the government securities interest rates were also declining in recent months, he said.
“We have seen market interest rates, other than short-term interest rates stabilizing at higher levels.”

Rs 404 billion has been loaned to private borrowers in 2017 compared to Rs 456 billion last year. He said that export earnings on cumulative basis had increased by 6.5% YoY and import expenditure increased by 9.2% YoY during the first seven months of 2017.
Workers’ remittances in July increased 3.4% YoY to US$ 3.9 billion.
