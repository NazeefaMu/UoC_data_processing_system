Civil Society activists stress need to abolish Executive Presidential system

Civil Society activists stressed the necessity of abolishing the Executive Presidential system when they met with Government political party representatives last evening to discuss Constitutional reforms.
The meeting was attended by Ministers Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, Mangala Samaraweera, Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka, Duminda Dissanayake, Mano Ganesan, Deputy Ministers Dr. Harsha de Silva, Eran Wickremaratne and Constitutional Lawyer MP Dr. Jayampathi Wickremaratne.
Prof Sarath Wijesuriya, Gamini Viyangoda, Saman Rathnapriya and Ven.Dambara Amila Thera took part in it representing the Civil Society.
The Civil Society representatives had also highlighted the need to go for a referendum on the proposed Constitutional reforms.
Speaking to the Daily News yesterday ‘Puravesi Balaya’ Co-convenor Gamini Viyangoda said there was a general agreement in the meeting that the Executive Presidency should be abolished.
He said Civil Society representatives forwarded a road map to the Government on how to approach the people on the new Constitution and devolution of power.
“We believe if all political parties, the SLFP, UNP, JVP, TNA and SLMC come together we can win the referendum with no difficulty,” Viyangoda said.
Speaking to the Daily News National Dialogue Minister Mano Ganesan said SLFP General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake was not explicit about the abolition of the Executive Presidency.
“He did not say that they were against the abolition of the Executive Presidency. He spoke about certain difficulties they have faced in that regard in the party. He did not say either ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to it. However, we decided to continue this dialogue between the political leaders and civil society in the future,” he said.
Minister Ganeshan said he brought out the concerns of the minority parties on the electoral reforms during the meeting. The meeting that lasted for about two and half hours took place at the Waters Edge in Battaramulla.
