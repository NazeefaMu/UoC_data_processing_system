Escape plan of four prisoners foiled

Kandy Police found three iron pellets infused with lead inside the mouth of a visitor to a cell holding four suspects arrested by Police on narcotics and other offenses. The suspect who is an associate of the four prisoners in custody, had brought them lunch. Police suspect that the lead pellets can be used to unlock padlocks and that this was the part of an escape plan of the four detainees. Kandy Police are conducting an investigation.
