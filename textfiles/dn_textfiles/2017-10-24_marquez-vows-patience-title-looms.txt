Marquez vows patience as title looms

Phillip Island: Marc Marquez has vowed not to be rash as he enters the final two races of the MotoGP season with a sizeable lead over title rival Andrea Dovizioso. The world champion Honda rider widened his gap over Dovizioso to 33 points with a hard-fought victory at the Australian MotoGP on Sunday. The Spaniard now heads to Malaysia for next weekend's penultimate race of the season knowing that the world title is his to lose. Only Dovizioso can overhaul him, but the Italian Ducati racer didn't do himself any favours by finishing 13th at Phillip Island.
Dovizioso, who had revived his title hopes by beating Marquez in Japan a week earlier, won in steamy Malaysia last season. With a maximum of 50 points up for grabs in the last two races, Marquez can shut the door with another emphatic performance at Sepang. But he is wary of getting too far ahead of himself as the season builds to a climax. "The victory makes me happy with that 33-point advantage," he said after Sunday's win. "Okay, it's a big advantage but now is the time to understand our options, where we can fight to take points but not be too aggressive. He said his lead in the title hunt was "big, but not enough".
