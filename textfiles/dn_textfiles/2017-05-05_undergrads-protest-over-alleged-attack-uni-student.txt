Undergrads protest over alleged attack on uni student

Students of the Anuradhapura Science and Technology University carried out an hour-long demonstration from the University to the Anuradhapura new bus stand yesterday protesting against the alleged inhuman attack on one of their fellow students by the director of the Institute.
Convener of the University's Students' Union Harsha Kumara said the student assaulted by the director was receiving treatment at the Anuradhapura Hospital. Students at the other Science and Technology Institutions at Matara, Panangala, Ratmalana, and Kuliyapitiya had shown solidarity with their struggle by hoisting black flags at their institutions, he said..
The struggle was against student oppression at the Science and Technology Universities, he said. Anuradhapura police said the director in the alleged attack has been taken into custody and he will be produced in court.
