Gifted prodigy

Head Prefect of Bishop’s College Hiruni Liyanarachchi is a young lady with moral fibre. Perfect Prefects interviews this young leader who is a combination of gentleness and strength.
“I believe in helping other people. I feel that we as a society need to help each other. You do not have to be a leader to help. You just need to extend your hand. People say we are still children and students and we cannot make an impact on the world. But I still believe we can help and make a difference even through the smallest act of helping. Even the memory of us helping can keep that person going on in a really hard situation. The memory that someone cared enough to help,” said Liyanarachchi.
Liyanarachchi is someone who feels strongly about those who are in difficulty and is interested in issues like Poverty and Female Rights.
“I think in Sri Lanka the way some people think about women in general, their attitude towards women in general, it is something that has to change, and it is not something we can do immediately, but we can start little by little. Because I know it will take a long time. But someone has to start it,” pointed out Liyanarachchi.
Liyanarachchi believes that one quality a head prefect should have is that she needs to be approachable.
Approachable
“We have a lot of scope and a lot of opportunities as prefects. I have the power to help others with whatever resources and power I have. For me to help them, they should be able to approach me and say – ‘this is the problem I have’. You need to be very kind and compassionate and be very approachable. You also need to be humble. And that comes with being approachable. They should be comfortable enough to approach me. I always try to have a nice and friendly relationship with the girls. It is more like a friend than a head prefect. Almost like a big sister. So they will come up to me and tell me what their problems are,” explained Liyanarachchi.
She also feels that we should be able to accept what comes our way.
“We have so many events that go on in school. So many things to organise. We give duties to prefects and we hope that these events will go well. And we hope things will not go wrong. One thing I have learnt throughout the years is that nothing will be perfect. You have to accept what comes your way. But if you know that you have tried your best and that you have given it your 100 percent, even the small things that go wrong, you can accept it.
You should not beat yourself up about it. You should be proud of yourself and confident about yourself and be happy with what you are doing. Also, you should never give up. There will be days when you are on your feet the whole day and nobody will pat you on the back and say thank you. But there are also instances when people will come up and thank you for the help and shake your hand.
Confident
That is a gift you will have. There are days that will be very tough. Sometimes before an event, you will find things going really wrong. Those things are going to happen and sometimes you are so tired. You feel like just breaking apart. But you can’t do that. When we became prefects our vice principal told us, that there are going to be times when you want to give up but you can’t. You have to keep doing it, tomorrow is another day and it will bring something good for you,” elucidated Liyanarachchi.
Liyanarachchi articulates when she feels too stressed.

“One thing I do when I feel too stressed is I articulate how I will fix things. If it has been a very stressful day, I go to one of my two deputies or my parents or my sister and explain what I am going to do and how I am going to approach it. When I have a plan clearly in my mind about what I am going to do, it makes me feel better when I tell somebody. When things get stressful I hate sitting somewhere and thinking about it. I want to get up and do something about it. To relax I read a lot of books, and I watch movies. I have cousins living right next door. So if I want to get away from work and have some fun, I go there and play with them and sometimes I call up my best friends,” added Liyanarachchi.
Liyanarachchi says that she is a fan of romantic comedies
“I love Bollywood movies, I am a huge Hindi Movie fan, I like movies based on autobiographies, for example, a person’s life journey. When it comes to books I like romance novels and autobiographies,” stated Liyanarachchi.
“When it comes to people I admire in this world, it would be Mother Teresa, Abraham Lincoln and Mahatma Gandhi. I don’t know everything about them but I love the message they left behind. I think this is very important. Also right here at Bishop’s my former head girl Mandani Tennekoon inspired me,” said Liyanarachchi.
Liyanarachchi also shared a story with us.
Stressed out
“When I first got to know that I was going to be head prefect before it was announced at Assembly, the Principal called me to her room. My two deputies and I were sitting outside and we did not know what was happening. We thought we were going to get scolded! First, my deputies were taken in and then I was called in. And then the principal congratulated me and told me I was going to be the Head Prefect.
My first reaction was to cry and I am a person who cries a lot. When I am stressed out I cry! But it makes me feel better! Some people get distraught, but not for me! For me, it is a way of release. So I cried in front of her because I was a little scared because I knew she had discussed this with other people and they were pinning their hopes on me and believing I could do it. I was so proud and honoured to take it. What would they think of me a few years down the line? That was the worst things that could happen! I am also friendly with the students. I have a good balance between my extra-curricular and studies. I try to maintain that balance. I also am hard working. I try to do my best!” shared Liyanarachchi.
Right now she is doing a combination of Commerce and Arts – Economics, Accounts and Literature. In the future, she wants to do Psychology or Sociology and start her own NGO and maybe even join the UN or the Red Cross.
“I would like to be a psychiatrist or a human rights activist. I would like to be an activist for women or help the street children. The street kids. Whenever I see street kids walking along with the mother begging, I think –‘what if I could give them a place to live and find the mother an occupation? Then she can send these kids to school? Then the cycle will be broken,’ believes Liyanarachchi.
Qualities
She especially mentioned her deputy prefects, Shahla Sangani and Radeesha Wanduragala, who have helped her a lot. She also mentioned that her teachers have been amazingly supporting and helping her.
“My mother and father are extremely supportive and I am who I am today because of them. They gave me all the qualities that have made me into a head prefect. They taught me how important it is to help. I have seen them helping other people. I hope I will have a good income and proper job so I will be able to help other people. My mother has gently guided me along my educational path. My grades have been good and I have balanced my extra-curricular activities. Whenever I have issues they help me out always. My Principal, Vice Principal and teachers have been extremely supportive. My prefect guild is the best,” informed Liyanarachchi.
She believes the most important quality is believing in yourself and being confident.“Always it is important that you learn about the things around you. Sometimes when we get responsibilities we do not know what to do. You have to inquire as to what can be done without just sitting around. You need to exert yourself and give your 100 percent. You may not know something but you ask and get help. Getting help is completely alright. Whatever you are doing you give it your maximum, because at the end of the day you can tell yourself that you tried your best,” pointed out Liyanarachchi. At the annual Avurudu celebrations.
