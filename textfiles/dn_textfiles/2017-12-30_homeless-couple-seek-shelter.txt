Homeless couple seek shelter

An elderly and feeble couple, Richard Silva and his wife K. Sikthy, were forced to lead a miserable life on the banks of the Mahaweli Ganga below the Katugastota bridge ever since they were evicted from their unauthorised house built on a Mahaweli zone land at Kahalla, Katugastota many years ago.
Their illiteracy was partly responsible for their present plight. They say they spend the night sleeping on a rock in the biting cold with no shelter over their heads.
They hoped that relevant authorities or a philanthropist would intervene to provide them with a decent shelter to lead their last days in contentment.
