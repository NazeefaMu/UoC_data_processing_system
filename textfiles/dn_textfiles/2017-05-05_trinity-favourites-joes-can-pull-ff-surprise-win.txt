Trinity favourites but Joes can pull ff surprise win

Singer ‘A’ Division League second round:
The eagerly awaited Singer ‘A’ Division League rugby tournament second round battle between the table leaders, Trinity College - Kandy and the giant killers St. Joseph’s College, Maradana will be played at the Havelock Park today, commencing at 4.15 p.m.
A mammoth crowd is expected to throng Havelock Park tomorrow to witness this grand game of the 2017 league rugby tournament.
Trinity have to force a win to have any chance of regaining the ‘A’ Division League title, which they eluded since 1987. They last won the elite division title under brilliant leader Tyral Rajapaksha.
Tomorrow’s match should turn out to be a battle between Joes’ power-packed forwards and Trinity’s speedy three quarters. St.Joseph’s forwards have given a terrific display throughout the season in the loose and should maintain their supremacy in this game as well.
In the set scrums Joe’s hooker Sven Muller will have the upper hand against the Trinity hooker while the line outs should be shared between the two schools.
But the biggest threat to Trinity will be posed by Joes’ speedy winger Sachith Silva with his power-packed runs down the flank.
The Trinitians have been unable to make the maximum use of the ‘good ball’ that comes their way as fly half Lashan Wijesuriya has either tried to go on his own or delayed his passes which resulted in him and the two centers being ‘nailed’ by their opposite numbers.
Trinity’s forte has been their speedy three quarters and the playing style of scrum half Anouka Boyagoda.
Centres Dilukshan Dange and strongly built Worren Weerakoon are hard runners who should punch holes in the Joesaphian defence with full back joining the line to form the overlap.
Their fly half Lashan Wijesuriya must come up with a much better display today if they are to pull this match through with a win.
