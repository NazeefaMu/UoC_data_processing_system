Massacre in Gaza

Israeli Defense Forces opened fire and killed 65 persons including women and children and injured 3,188 in a brutal massacre since May 14. The youngest to die was an 8 month old baby girl.
This was the brutal reaction of the apartheid state of Israel against Palestinians who were protesting peacefully against the illegal occupation of their own land. Not only were they unarmed but men, women and children –whole families took part in it. They were inside Gaza-their homeland, an enclave which has been converted into a prison house by Israel by cordoning them off and denying even basic facilities such as water and electricity. In attacking the protesters Israel Defence forces used not only tear gas and live bullets but also fighter jets and tanks.
They were commemorating the great catastrophe, called Naqba in Arabic. Naqba was the eviction of 700,000 Palestinians from their homeland during 1947 – 48 when the United Nations decided to create two states-one Arab and other Jewish on Palestine territory. Though Israel – the Jewish state, was forcibly created the other has not been created yet. The commemoration this year was the 70th annual event.
The protest this year was also for another reason. That is the opening of the United States Embassy in Jerusalem violating international agreements and resolutions of the United Nations.
According to international agreements Jerusalem was considered a city common and sacred to all – Jews, Muslims and Christians. Its status was to be decided as the last act of a peace process. This forced the Palestinians to start their protest on May 14th - the date of opening of the US Embassy in Jerusalem, a day ahead of the Naqba Day on May 15. The protest called the “Great Return March” continues heroically despite the massacre.
The international community is outraged at this aggressive and brutal suppression of the protest which actually amounts to genocide. Demonstrations in solidarity with the fighting Palestinians were held in Chicago, London, Berlin, Rome, Tunis and several other cities in the world. Turkey has expelled the Israeli Ambassador. South Africa withdrew its Ambassador from Israel. Belgium and Ireland summon their Israel Ambassadors and called for explanations.
World leaders including the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and UN Human Rights Chief Prince Saed Ra’ad al – Hussein have condemned Israeli killings. The Arab League met in emergency session in Cairo to coordinate actions to counter US and Israeli action in Gaza. The Organization of Islamic Countries (OIC) is meeting today (18) in Istanbul over the same issue. Leaders of Russia, China, Britain, Turkey and several other countries have condemned the US and Israeli conduct.
Strangely or not so strangely Saudi Arabia and several Middle Eastern Arab countries are silent on the issue, thus displaying their loyalty with the United States. The United States also vetoed a resolution in the UN Security Council calling for an investigation into the massacre in Gaza.
Meanwhile the Western media are conducting a campaign of vilification against Palestinians and their resistance movement Hamas calling them terrorists and depicting the aggressive state of Israel as a victim of terrorism. Unfortunately media in the Third World also participate in the dissemination of this false claim.
It is time that all who desire peace get together and oppose the aggression against Palestine by Israel and the United States.
Trump – Kim Summit in danger
A cloud of uncertainty has enveloped the summit meeting between President Donald Trump of the United States and President Kim Jong Un of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea scheduled to be held in Singapore on June 12. This is a sequel to some unwelcome comments by US Presidential Security Advisor John Bolten urging North Korea to follow the Libyan model of denunciation and North Korea cancelling the scheduled North South Summit scheduled prior to it. The North Korean action was a reaction to the US-South Korean military drills named Max Thunder that are being held now with the participation of 1,000 US and 500 South Korean troops using 100 war planes including - 12 radar evading fighters, an unspecified number of B- 52 bombers and F -15K jets. North Korea has described the drills as “an undisguised challenge”, a “deliberate military provocation” and a “rehearsal for invading North Korea”.
North Korea’s First Vice – Minister of Foreign Affairs Kim Kya Gwon has reportedly said, “If the Trump Administration pushes us into a corner and force us to give up our nuclear weapons unilaterally, then we will no longer take interest in Summit talks and would have to reconsider.”
China has, however, urged North Korea to proceed with the Summit. North Korea has taken several positive steps in preparation for the Summit. It has a weapon test site on May 25 – 27 and even invited foreign journalists including those from the US to witness it.
US position is less clear. While US Secretary of State has said that the US and North Korea are “in complete agreement with the objectives” of the Summit John Bolton and several others have played a different tune.
