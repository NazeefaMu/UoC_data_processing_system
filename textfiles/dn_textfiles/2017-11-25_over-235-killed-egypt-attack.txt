Over 235 killed in Egypt attack

Gunmen attacked a packed mosque in Egypt’s the North Sinai Province on Friday and set off a bomb, killing at least 235 people in one of the country’s deadliest attacks in recent memory, state media reported.
A bomb explosion ripped through the Rawda mosque roughly 40 kilometres west of the North Sinai capital of El-Arish before gunmen opened fire on the worshippers gathered for weekly Friday prayers, officials said.
Egypt declared three days of mourning as President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi met his security ministers to follow developments.
Witnesses said the assailants had surrounded the mosque with all-terrain vehicles then planted a bomb outside. The gunmen then mowed down the panicked worshippers as they attempted to flee. - AFP
