INSEE Cement’s contribution enriches  Colombo’s B2B Projects

With high rise iconic buildings rapidly changing the skyline in the city of Colombo, INSEE Cement is focusing its attention on these Projects that benefit from the strength and durability that its product portfolio offers.
B2B projects springing up in the city primarily come under two main categories – one is high rise buildings such as apartment complexes and hotels and the other is infrastructure facilities such as dams, bridges or highways and other major developments.
High rise buildings on the other hand require high performance concrete combined with durability that brings a good return on investment (ROI) for the investor. This is achieved by ensuring more floor area by reducing column sizes with high strength concrete.
Explaining how INSEE Cement contributes to Sri Lanka’s rapidly developing construction industry, Sanka Seneviratne, Head of Industrial Sales at Siam City Cement (Lanka) said “We have introduced performance monitoring tools to uplift industry standards and contribute to training, coaching and mentoring of engineers through knowledge sharing on the latest technology. This is achieved via knowledge sharing sessions initiated by the INSEE Innovation and Application centre.”
“Especially when it comes to large scale projects and high-rise buildings, we are closely working with government institutions, universities and organization as well as professional bodies to develop solutions. We work with three state universities - Moratuwa, Peradeniya and Ruhunu - to further develop solutions” he added.
“We developed a solution for Altair iconic project when they required early strength of 25 N/mm2 within 24 hours with INSEE Rapid Flow a high early strength cement and developed a solution for Lotus Tower project which required a durable concrete that can last almost 100 years. For that we have a developed concrete solution using INSEE Extra a certified low heat sulphate resistant cement. Hambantota and Colombo South harbours needed a solution for concrete that is exposed to sea water. For Colombo City Centre, another iconic project, we proposed high flow concrete to reduce the time needed to place the concrete and reduce overall costs,” he explained, highlighting some of the recent projects that benefited from INSEE Cement. INSEE Cement contributes to strengthening the nation in other ways too. “We conduct training programmes to uplift the industry by knowledge sharing and promoting green cement products or blended cement which is minus CO2. Reducing global warming and contributing to climate change endeavours is one of our key focus areas,” he said.
