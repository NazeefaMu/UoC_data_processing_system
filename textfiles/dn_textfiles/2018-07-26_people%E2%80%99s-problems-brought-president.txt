Gama Hadana Gamana in Puttalam:
People’s problems brought to President

The inaugural Gama Hadana Gamana programme coinciding with the Grama Shakthi poverty alleviation programme, launched under a concept of President Maithripala Sirisena, was held in the Puttalam district, recently.
Under this programme, all people’s representatives in divisional secretariat areas covering the district were summoned to one place and afforded an opportunity to place their development problems before President Sirisena through video conferencing.
As an urgent solution to the drinking water problem brought up during this programme, Reverse Osmosis water supply networks were set up in the Puttalam, Navagattegama, Anamaduwa and Dankotuwa Divisional Secretariat Divisions through the kidney disease prevention programme on the instructions of the President, a press release by the President’s Media Division said.
President Sirisena opened the networks from the Presidential Secretariat premises through remote control communication technology.
People attending the opening ceremonies were provided technological facilities at the venues to watch the event live.
The Reverse Osmosis plants were set up at the Navagattegama Primary School, Anamaduwa Madya Maha Vidyalaya and Dankotuwa Metikotuwa Nelum Uyana. Each Reverse Osmosis plant has the capacity to provide 10,000 litres of water daily for 3,000 beneficiaries. Already 450 Reverse Osmosis Plants costing Rs. 675 million were set up countrywide under this programme on behalf of 1,092,500 beneficiaries to provide drinking water to the rural population to completely eliminate kidney disease from the country.
Presidential Task Force Project Director on the prevention of kidney diseases Asela Iddawela participated with the President during this programme.
