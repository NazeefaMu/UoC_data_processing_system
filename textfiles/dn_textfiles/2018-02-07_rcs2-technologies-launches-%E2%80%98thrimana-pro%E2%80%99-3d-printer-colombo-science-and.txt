RCS2 Technologies  launches  ‘Thrimana Pro’ 3D Printer with Colombo Science  and Technology Cell

RCS2 Technologies Limited has introduced 3D printing to Sri Lanka and has since, made a significant venture in to 3D printing, offering a series of Thrimana 3D Printers along with materials.
3D solutions by RCS2 Technologies are offered to almost every leading industry making sure their first 3D printing experience to be both simple and of the highest quality.
When Thrimana started their journey the 3D printing know how in Sri Lankan was very little even though the technology was introduced to Sri Lanka a decade ago. As a pioneer of 3D printing industry in Sri Lanka Thrimana shoulder the burden and responsibility at bringing the nation to the forefront of this technology.
To bridge the gap Thrimana collaborated with several government and non-government organizations to spread awareness on this. The work carried out by Thrimana is a major driving force behind this growth and are proud to be able to bring Sri Lanka to the forefront of this technology. The goal of Thrimana was to prepare our nation for the upcoming industrial revolution and they are proud of it. Going along with their vision of 3D printing advancement, the company joined hands with Colombo Science and Technology Cell (Cell) to develop the first ever 3D printer designed in Sri Lanka. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between RCS2 Technologies and the Cell on July 07, 2016. The research team was headed by two academics from Department of Physics, University of Colombo, Dr. M.K. Jayananda and Dr. H.H.E. Jayaweera and was assisted by Udara Dissanayake. After carrying out intensive research over a period of one year, the research team in cooperation with RCS2 Technologies team was able to successfully launch the 3D printer “Thrimana Pro” on January 9.
Prof. Lakshman Dissanayake, Vice Chancellor of the University of Colombo, Indika De Zoysa, Senior Consultant at ICTA and other dignitaries from the Faculty of Science and RCS2 graced the occasion.
Colombo Science and Technology Cell (Cell) was established in 2013 with the funds from the Higher Education for the Twenty first Century (HETC), Quality Innovation Grant (QIG)-window 4, to support the researchers at the Faculty of Science to commercialize their research findings.
The Cell is acting as a Tech Transfer Office at the Faculty of Science and already there are two products in the market arising from the research conducted at the faculty. Thrimana PRO.
