Bank officer falls to his death from tourist guest house balcony

A youth had died last Sunday (April 1), after he fell from the balcony of a tourist guest house close to the Lakshapaana water fall in Norton Bridge.
According to the police in Norton Bridge, the incident has occurred when the 26 year old youth who was an executive in a leading private bank, had given a party to his friends to celebrate the joy of purchasing a brand new car. However, after consuming too much liquor at the party, he had reportedly fallen from the upstairs of the tourist guest house.
However, the victim who sustained severe injuries, was immediately admitted to the Lakshapaana hospital and due to his pathetic status, was later transferred to the teaching hospital in Kandy.
However, the victim had ultimately succumbed to his death while he was receiving treatments in the teaching hospital in Kandy.
The victim was identified as Sambandan Prem Kumar (26) who was a resident in Wilfred Town in Hatton. The Acting Magistrate in Hatton, Damayanthi Fernando had visited the location where the accident occurred for a scene inspection and had further given an order to the Judicial Medical Officer of Hatton Hospital, to carry out the post mortem related to the dead body of the victimized youth.
