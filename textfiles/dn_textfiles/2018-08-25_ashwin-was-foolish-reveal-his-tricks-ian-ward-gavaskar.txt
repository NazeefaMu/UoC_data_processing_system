Ashwin was foolish to reveal his tricks to Ian Ward: Gavaskar

Ravichandran Ashwin has had a couple of dry test matches after starting with a 7-wicket haul in the first one against England.
The first test – which India lost narrowly by 31 runs – was marked by two identical (read magical) deliveries from Ashwin which removed English opener Alastair Cook in both the innings of the match in similar fashion.
But since that tremendous start, Ashwin after toiling mercilessly for a combined 41 overs in the next two test matches, has been able to bag just one wicket.
Yes you heard that right.
India’s spin-cordon head, Ravichandran Ashwin’s form after his 7-wicket opener has dipped to a dismal wicket-less second test at Lord’s and then a one wicket stint at Trent Bridge.
So, why such a performance you ask?
Apparently, it could be due to an interview given by Ashwin to former cricketer and journalist Ian Ward.
In his interview with Ward after the first test match, when asked about how should youngsters go about their techniques, Ashwin not only demonstrated his grips but also revealed his actions for particular deliveries.
This recording will no doubt be used by the England think tank and especially their batsmen when they sit down before every Test to plan how to counter the Indian bowlers and particularly Ashwin,” wrote Gavaskar in his column with the Sportstar Live.
It was understandable why Gavaskar was not amused by the whole incident.
Ashwin went onto tell Ian Ward about the deliveries that he had developed over the past 24 months and further gave out a step by step breakdown of his multiple variations.
Sunil Gavaskar said it was like a magician revealing his bag of tricks to the audience. Perhaps it won’t make a difference and Ashwin will go on to bag heaps of wickets in the rest of the series too, but if he doesn’t then he has only himself to blame.
While, of course, the theory clicked with quite a few people, some were of the opinion that he had done it deliberately.
But the fact of the matter remains that Ashwin has only picked up one wicket in the last two test matches against England.
In times when technology is used day in and day out to gain tactical advantages over the opponent and players are constantly trying to develop new variations and hide their secrets, Ashwin’s casual chat has been seen by Indian cricket pundits as a case of over-confidence which could eventually end up hurting him and the Indian team during their tour of England.
