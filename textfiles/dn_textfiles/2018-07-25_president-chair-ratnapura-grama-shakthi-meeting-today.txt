President to chair Ratnapura Grama Shakthi meeting today

President Maithripala Sirisena will chair the Sabaragamuwa Province Operation Committee of the Grama Shakthi people’s movement at the Ratnapura Provincial Council auditorium this afternoon (July 25).
“Grama Shakthi” is a countrywide project implemented by the Presidential Secretariat under the supervision of President Maithripala Sirisena to address poverty issues in the country.
Today’s meeting attended by the Provincial political authorities and state officials will pay attention on the implementation of the said programme in the province, its progress as well as plans envisaged in the future. Special attention will be made to address burning problems of the people and action to be taken to resolve them urgently.
The main factor which differentiates Grama Shakthi from other people’s movements in the country is that it shows the path for people to shun the subsidy mentality and rise in life through personal effort. Several projects have already been launched under the Grama Shakthi movement in Sabaragamuwa to improve the living standards of low income groups and the President is due to hand over the first instalment of funding due to Grama Shakthi people’s committees in the Province to the Government Agents of Kegalle and Ratnapura District at today’s meeting.
After the meeting the President will inspect the Ganegama Production village of the Grama Shakthi programme and inquire into problems encountered by the people.
