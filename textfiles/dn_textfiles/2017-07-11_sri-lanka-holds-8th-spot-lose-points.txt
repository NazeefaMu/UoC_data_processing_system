Sri Lanka holds onto 8th spot but lose points

Sri Lanka held onto the crucial eighth position in the ICC One-Day International rankings despite suffering their first ever ODI series loss to Zimbabwe (3-2).
However Sri Lanka lost five valuable rating points for their defeat against a low ranked side and thus have a total of 88 rating points which is 10 more than ninth placed West Indies who despite losing their five-match ODI series to India (3-1) gained a point following their win in the fourth ODI against a higher ranked team.
Prior to the commencement of the two series in Sri Lanka and in the Caribbean, Sri Lanka had 93 rating points and West Indies 77 rating points. Sri Lanka’s next series is at home against India for five ODIs while West Indies travel to Ireland for one ODI and to England for a five-match ODI series.
Sri Lanka’s eighth place guarantees them automatic qualification for the 2019 Cricket World Cup at the moment. Only the top eight ranked teams at the September 30, 2017 deadline will gain automatic qualification. The teams ranked below eight will have to face a qualification round that involves 10 countries including associate members where only the top two teams will qualify for the main event.
Sri Lanka are currently standing on a knifes edge because if West Indies happen to win the series against England they would improve their standings and may displace them unless Sri Lanka perform well against India.
Meanwhile Zimbabwe who are placed 11th gained six points from their series win over Sri Lanka and have 52 rating points. - ST
