Rebuilding of flood-devastated Kalutara accelerated

A special meeting to discuss arrangements to rebuild the devastated areas by floods and landslides in the Kalutara district and disrupted community life was held recently presided by City Planing and Water Supply Minister Rauf Hakeem, who has been placed in-charge of rebuilding work in the district by President Maithripala Sirisena.
Several important decisions were taken in order to continue the relief operations by overcoming any obstacles and rebuild infrastructure facilities quickly,
Special attention was drawn to implement an emergency programme to combat dengue. An electoral level campaign would be held next week in this regard.
The armed forces, police and the NWSDB would be called upon to assist the programme. A stock of equipment and dry food rations donated by the NWSDB branch and philanthropists in Anuradhapura were distributed among the displaced by Minister Hakeem at the conclusion of the meeting.
