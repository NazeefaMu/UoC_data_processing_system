NSSF Awards Ceremony 2017
Youngsters impress among experienced shooters

 The National Shooting Sports Federation of Sri Lanka (NSSF) had its annual Awards Ceremony for 2017 at the Duncan White Auditorium of the Ministry of Sports in Torrington Square last week. Among the main achievers were youngsters representing the Sri Lanka Schools and other clubs while experienced shooters too were rewarded for their performances during the season of 2017.
Of the events during last year's event calendar, the main focus were on the three top NSSF events -- the National Air Rifle and Air Gun Championship, Trap and Skeet National Championships. Veteran shooter Ruwini Abeymanne and in-form Suranga Fernando, both from Cambrians Shooting Club, took major honours from the National Air Rifle and Air Gun Championship, which was held at the Naval Range in Welisara last November. Abeymanne won the Women's Air Pistol and Sports Pistol events while Fernando claimed the win of the Free Pistol event.
Both teamed up to win the Mixed event for Air Pistol, that were introduced for the first time along with the Air Pistol event. The Mixed Air Rifle event was won by Chanidu Senanayake of Maliyadeva College and Amanda Amerasinghe of Devi Balika Vidyalaya.
Others who earned accolades were Gamini Walgama and Niranjan Dissanayake, both from Police Sports Club.
In the Shot Gun events, shooters from Negombo Rifle Club (NRC), Colombo Clay Target Shooting Club (CCTSC) and both men and women from Air Force SC outshone. Airman Sandakelum Ranasinghe claimed the Skeet title while Mohan Gilbert of NRC won the Trap championship. Tharushi Mekala of Air Force claimed the Women's championship in Skeet. In the Junior/Youth segment Akila Sithumina Vidanage of Royal College went on to win the Air Pistol event.
Akila is a member of the National Youth Shooting pool and another of its members, Natasha Handelage of St. Bridget's Convent, won the Girls’ Air Pistol event.
Chanidu Senanayake of Athugala Sports Shooting Club, from Maliyadeva College, claimed the Air Rifle event in the Junior/Youth Boy's segment. Amanda Amerasinghe won its Girls’ event. Both are members of the Sri Lanka Youth pool.
