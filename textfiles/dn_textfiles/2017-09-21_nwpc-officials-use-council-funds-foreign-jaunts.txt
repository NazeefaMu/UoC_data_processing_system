NWPC officials use council funds for foreign jaunts

Officials of the North Western Provincial Council (NWPC) have spent Rs. 20 million council funds for foreign trips in 2016. About 107 officers are reported to have utilised public funds for their trips abroad, UNP councilor Chitralal Fernando revealed these facts at the monthly meeting of the council in Kurunegala.
He said the Provincial Council allocates Rs. 25 million annually from its budget for councilors’ foreign trips. However, not a single councilor has gone abroad last year.
“We have to utilise public funds sparingly as the people are suffering due to many hardships,” Fernando said.
