On a ‘high’ ?

The time has come to storm the classroom! The International Center for Credentialing and Education of Addiction Professionals (ICCE) is about to take the war into the classroom with the weapon being the books!
The idea is to equip people/the workforce with the knowledge and skills to combat drugs. Daily News visited Colombo Plan to find out more about this initiative.
“As part of Colombo Plan’s flagship Long Term Scholarship Program (LTSP) the International Centre for Credentialing and Education (ICCE) is about to launch a fellowship program in collaboration with Universities in Asia and Africa. ICCE is part of the Colombo Plan which has 27 member countries. The Fellowship program is a collaboration between ICCE and Tertiary education institutions. The Colombo Plan ICCE fellowship program will bring mid-career addiction professionals from Africa and Asia to participating universities in the region to further enhance their professional development in the addiction treatment field. This fellowship program will be of importance to Sri Lanka since ICCE is looking at collaborating with higher education institutions in Sri Lanka as well,” said ICCE, Director Tay Bian How.
ICCE celebrates seven years of dedicated work to train, professionalize and expand the drug demand reduction workforce in the region. In February 2009, ICCE began work as a project under the Drug Advisory Program and has come a long way since then.
“The World Drug problem is very serious. There are quarter of million people using drugs from age 15 – 64. People are relapsing and this addiction is not curable. But it can be managed just like hypertension and diabetes. Recovery can be lifelong. A person may need multiple episodes which means you may have to go to the treatment center several times,” explained How.
All this research has culminated in a plan of action. Without just collecting dust on someone’s shelf it is now going to be used as a means of empowering people.
“For the serious drug problem, there is a lot of research being done. The US has done so much research on drugs, but research alone is not enough. It has to be converted to practice. Until then it remains an academic exercise. If you are doing research in the university and it does not yield anything new or translated to actual practice, it is simply an academic exercise and just published in a journal. So, what we do is, we take this research and translate into teaching manuals to teach. These evidence based practices that we have got through research can be implemented into actual practice in treating a drug addict and in preventing a young person from getting into drugs,” How pointed out. The easiest way to train the workforce is in Universities. That is why one of our current initiatives is to integrate all these manuals into a University degree course. We want to launch this fellowship program particularly for Asia and Africa.
Basic eligibility criteria
* A bachelor degree in a relevant field of study
* Five years working experience in a drug treatment or rehabilitation setting
* Less than 45 year of age
Program structure
A one year full time specialized program in addiction science is offered inclusive of a 240 hour practicum at a selected drug treatment or rehabilitation setting and submission of a project paper. This 30 credit hour course offers the latest evidence based strategies and interventions in Addiction Science, Substance Use Disorders (SUD) as outlined in the Basic level Universal Treatment Curriculum for Substance Use Disorders (UTC).

- Professional ethics
“This is a one year program – a post graduate diploma program for midcareer personnel. These are people who are working in the substance use disorder field or working in an Addiction treatment or Prevention field. Currently we have a University in Malaysia. The University in Malaysia has confirmed that they have got all the approval for the post graduate diploma. It is not easy to implement a program like this since it has to be approved by the Minister of Higher Education and Quality assurance and so on. Cyberjaya University College of Medical Sciences, Malaysia has already agreed to host this fellowship. ICCE is looking at collaborating with other universities,” outlined How.
The scholars will only learn Addiction Treatment or Prevention of Substance Use Disorder. “You have people working in the field. They go for short courses and collect one or two week certificates. The significance of this fellowship program/ Post Graduate Diploma is that it is whole package. And when you get that qualification/ that diploma, you make yourself a specialist. You make yourself a professional,” stated How.
The mandate of the Colombo Plan is to train and professionalize the workforce. To professionalize we have international credentials. In some countries you need a credential or license to work. ICCE is providing the license.
“What we are giving is the International Certified Addiction Professional (ICAP), Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3. The United States Credential is called Master Addiction Counsellor (MAC) or National Certified Addiction Counsellor (NCAC) Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3.
So there are three separate qualifications here – The Post Graduate Diploma in Addiction Science, the International Certified Addiction Professional (ICAP) and the Master Addiction Counselor (MAC) or National Certified Addiction Counselor (NCAC) - This is the US Credential Out of these, those who successfully complete the ICCE Fellowship will be awarded the first two qualifications – the Post Graduate Diploma and the ICAP. Those who are not coming from this program and take short courses, can still sit for our exam to get credentials. So far 47 countries are participating in our programs. We have a singular universal credential recognized globally. If you want to work in the US, you can work there if you have our credentials,” elucidated How.
