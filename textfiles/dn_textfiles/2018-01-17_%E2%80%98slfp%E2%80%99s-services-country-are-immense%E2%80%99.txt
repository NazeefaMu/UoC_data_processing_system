‘SLFP’s services to the country are immense’

Speaking at an election propaganda meeting held in Galagedara, Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama said that the SLFP has rendered a distinguished service to the country and the people of Sri Lanka.
Speaking further Dr. Amunugama said:"No one can forget the distinguished services rendered to our country by SLFP governments. The role played by our party to develop this country and to protect the people's right and public property is immense. The services rendered by the SLFP to strengthen public welfare programmes and to elevate the levels of education and health servicesare tremendous. At the same time it is necessary to mention that the President will not hesitate to get rid of fraud and corruption and to take strong decisions in regard to those who perpetrate fraud and acts of corruption. It is necessary to state that the President will act without discrimination in taking decisions in regard to building a just society and establishing a clean administration, by getting rid of corruption and waste.
Whatever forces may attempt to destroy the SLFP that will not be possible. History clearly shows as to what the fate was of those who broke away from the SLFP. Therefore it is necessary to say that the giant tree that the SLFP is, will not fall down and that the rural peasantry of this country always stands dedicated to protect it. No one can prevent the SLFP becoming victorious in the present election.
Due to the dedication of our party and the decision of the President, it was possible to do away with the proportional system of representation and the preference voting system and introduce the ward system of elections. Through that you have now got the opportunity to elect your own representative. I must remind you that this ward system was established in the teeth of opposition by other parties.
Dr.Amunugama speaking further said:I was able to develop in all spheres, a Galgedara electoral division which was steeped in darkness. That was possible because continuously for 25 years I was elected as MP for Galagedara, through your consent. Elected an MP, I was able, holding various ministerial portfolios, to develop all sectors of this constituency. I improved to a very high level, the educational, highways, cultural, sports, health and such other facilities in this area. I was also able to provide community halls, a weekly fair, a courts complex, bank buildings and other government buildings. You are now making use of those facilities. I was able to prove everything by deed and not by mere talk. I have contributed to the multi faceted development of not only this constituency but of the whole district.At the same time ever one knows that the whole country benefitted by my services in the various powerful ministerial portfolios I have held. I feel a modest pride in that achievement.
"We are always thinking of ways and means of solving the people's problems.The SLFP's and the President's desire is to provide the maximum service possible to the people. We have dedicated ourselves for the people to life's end. The President will not hesitate to punish the robbing of people's money and those who committed such robberies.That is the SLFP policy. Our desire is to sacrifice ourselves for and on behalf of the people,"he said.
