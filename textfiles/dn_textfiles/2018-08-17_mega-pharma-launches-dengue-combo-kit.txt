Mega Pharma launches Dengue Combo Kit

In a bid to curtail the increasing number of dengue victims in Sri Lanka, Mega Pharma (Pvt) Ltd, launched the CareStart Dengue Combo Kit with Dr. Byoung Don Han doing the introductory to the local doctors.
The CareStart Dengue Combo Kit will be the ideal solution to detect if an individual is diagnosed with dengue at a very early stage with results guaranteed in a matter of 20 minutes.
The project in Sri Lanka was initiated Mega Pharma headed by Shirantha Peries. The establishment announced its newest product which entered to the company’s portfolio, the Access Bio’s CareStart Dengue Combo Kit. The launch ceremony held at the Waters’ Edge Hotel in Battaramulla, was graced by the representatives of both organisations as well as local doctors.
The dengue virus is transmitted by mosquitoes, and more than one-third of the world’s population is at risk for infection. With no vaccines available to prevent infection with the dengue virus, early diagnosis and prompt supportive treatment could substantially lower the risk of medical complications and even death.
Wells Bio CEO Dr. Byoung Don Han explained that the CareStart Dengue Combo Kit provides a “qualitative rapid diagnostic test that can simultaneously detect dengue virus in all clinical stages using both dengue NS1 antigen and anti-dengue antibodies (IgM/IgG) with one device”.
“The kit also provides a diagnosis of dengue infection from acute to convalescent stage, and the detection of all four dengue serotypes from serum, plasma, or whole blood”, Dr. Byoung Don Han stated.
Chairman and Managing Director of Mega Pharma (Pvt) Ltd, Shirantha Peries explained:
“The Mega Pharma Group of Companies has registered the CareStart Dengue Combo Kit, since it detects two parameters, that is the primary infection and the secondary infection at the same time. Therefore the chances of missing dengue fever whether, its primary, secondary or even mixed infection, is very remote and almost not possible, but through that the amount of lives that will be saved in this country is our objective.”
Formed in Somerset in New Jersey, USA in 2001, Access Bio Inc conducts research, development projects, manufacturing process and trades vitro rapid diagnostic tests, biosensors, and molecular diagnostic products throughout the globe.
With its Korea-based division, Wells Bio Inc, which possesses state-of-the-art research and development facility, Access Bio Inc manufactures over 120 million rapid diagnostic tests annually for the detection of a range of infectious diseases, including malaria, dengue and HIV.
