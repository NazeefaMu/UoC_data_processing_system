Bond Commission says : ‘We know what we are doing’

The Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating and inquiring into the Treasury Bond issue yesterday said that only witnesses the Commission considers ‘relevant and necessary’ to the inquiry will be summoned before the Commission.
Responding to ‘some comments and reports in the media’ querying as to if evidence given by witnesses previously were relevant to the Commission and suggestions made by ‘various parties’ as to whether other witnesses they think should be summoned, the Commission said that it cannot go beyond its mandate.
“We also wish to make clear that, this Commission of Inquiry will not call witnesses whose evidence is not necessary or relevant merely because various persons express opinions in the media or at another forum that such witnesses should be summoned by the Commission of Inquiry,” a statement issued by the Commission said. The statement further said that the Commission has been careful to ensure the relevance of those summoned to give evidence at the Commission and that only such witnesses whose testimony the commission decides to be relevant have been called before the Commission.
