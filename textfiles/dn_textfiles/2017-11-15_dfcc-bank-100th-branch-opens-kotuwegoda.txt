DFCC Bank 100th branch  opens at Kotuwegoda

The ‘Matara City Branch’ which is the DFCC Bank’s 100th branch and second branch in Matara was opened by Director and CEO Lakshman Silva at Kotuwegoda Matara on November 13.
“It was a memorable day for me, as I was the manager of DFCC’s Matara branch 26 years ago and today as CEO of the bank I am privileged to open the 100th branch at Matara,” said Lakshman Silva DFCC’s Director and Chief Executive Officer addressing the gathering of distinguished guests and customers who attended the opening ceremony.
“I am overwhelmed to see some business establishments which I served 26 years ago have grown into large business conglomerates now. Today DFCC is a Commercial Bank and  not limited to development financing and is ready to serve all your day to day banking needs including letters of credit, business loans, personal loans, housing loans, leasing facilities, current accounts, savings accounts, children’s savings accounts and many more facilities.”
“I also take this opportunity to caution you that there are only a few banks that meet the Central Bank requirement of having capital assets of twenty billion rupees. There are only a few banking institutions in the island that can meet this requirement and you should be cautious with whom you deal with. Today the DFCC Bank has an AA- rating and capital assets of over forty billion rupees.”
DFCC Bank’s Regional Manager Pradeep Alwis welcomed the guests while Manager of the Matara City Branch Harshaka Rupasinghe made the vote of thanks.
Chairman of Nipolac Paint Industres and President of the Chamber of Commerce Raja Hewabowala, CEO and Managing Director of Deen Brothers Imports Deshamanya Najeeb Deen were among the first depositors at DFCC’s Matara City Branch.
Customers availed themselves of credit card facilities, business loans, housing loans, personal loans, leasing facilities while children’s account holders were presented with their rewards.
