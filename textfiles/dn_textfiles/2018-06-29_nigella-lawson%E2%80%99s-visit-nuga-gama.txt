Nigella Lawson’s visit to Nuga Gama

World renowned cook and food writer Nigella Lawson visited Cinnamon Grand’s Nuga Gama, the village in the city, and experienced a taste of authentic Sri Lankan cuisine, during her recent tour of Sri Lanka on the invitation of Cinnamon Life. She was warmly welcomed by Cinnamon Hotels and Resorts Sector Head - City Hotels and General Manager Cinnamon Grand Rohan Karr, the Management and staff.
Nigella showed a genuine warmth and interest in learning about local cuisine and finding the time to offer a word of encouragement and admiration to the local village ammes. She was given a tour by the village headman, Hemantha Siriwardena, and watched eagerly as several local dishes were prepared for her, including shrimp and drumstick curry, dhal and spinach curry and treats such as kokis and other sweetmeats. As a home cook, Nigella was quite keen on learning about the local culture and its history, in particular its relation to the spices and unique ingredients that gave the dishes their authentic Sri Lankan flavour.
