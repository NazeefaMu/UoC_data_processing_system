Presidential Commission to inspect CB dealing room

The Presidential Commission to Investigate and Inquire into the Issuance of Treasury Bonds is to inspect the dealing room of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka today.
The Presidential Commission Chairman Supreme Court Justice K.T. Chitrasiri, Supreme Court Justice Prasanna Jayawardane, Retired Deputy Auditor General Kandasamy Veluppillai and the panel of Senior States Counsel to assist the Presidential Commission will participate in this inspection.
Justice Chitrasiri said the date was fixed in convenience with the Treasury Bill auction which is to take place at the CBSL today.
The Commission said it is important to watch the auction proceedings within a dealing room to get practical knowledge and exposure to proceed with the inquiry on the matter at hand.
It was revealed that the inspection will only be similar to a site tour and not an inquiry.
“No one will be questioned and the Presidential Commission will take down notes accordingly at the site,” Justice Chitrasiri said.
