Traditional New Year celebration at Nuga Gama

While the customary rituals of boiling milk and preparation of milk rice will take place at 5.41 a.m, keeping to the auspicious timings, Cinnamon Grand’s much loved village in the city Nuga Gama will lay out a special Avurudu table featuring an array of sweetmeats from around the island prepared with pride by the ammés. This will set the tone for the Grand New Year celebrations, starting 7 a.m. One can taste pippin hot kevum, crispy kokis and other delicious treats like aasmi, dodol, naran kevum, thala aggala and much more at this festive table!
Creating the perfect village Avurudu experience, a series of traditional games will also be lined up for patrons to enjoy. From 8a.m onwards to the beating of the raban, patrons can take part in pancha dameema, kana mutti, andahaya kiri keveema, lime and spoon race, coconut scarping, etc; while the younger guests can compete in the likes of sack race, pin the eye on the elephant, bunis kaema and puwak kola race.
A special lunch will be laid out as well with a buffet of favoured local fare. Dishes that are usually served at the New Year tables in Sinhalese and Tamil households will take centre stage here.
Making gift giving that much more convenient, Cinnamon Grand’s Coffee Stop and Nuga Gama will promote palmyrah box hampers. These hamper boxes will feature traditional Sri Lankan treats such as kvum, kokis, athirasa, naran kevum, sudu aluwa, aasmi, dodol, sillara, pani walalu, weli thalapa, thala aggala, coconut toffee and Tamil sweetmeats including laddu, payatham pariyaram, boondi and achchu murukku. These special gift boxes will be available from April 10-13.
