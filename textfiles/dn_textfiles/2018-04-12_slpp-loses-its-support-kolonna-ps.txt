SLPP loses its support in Kolonna PS

The SLPP lost the majority support in the Kolonna Pradeshiya Sabha with two of its members deciding to go independent.
The maiden meeting of the Pradeshiya Sabha was held at its meeting hall yesterday. The first motion which was presented to empower Chairman Rupasena Thalwattage, had to be postponed without taking it up for debate.
