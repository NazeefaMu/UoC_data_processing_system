Australian batting coach Graeme Hick to pit wits against England in Ashes

SYDNEY - Former England batsman Graeme Hick and bowling coach Troy Cooley will pit their wits against the tourists when they mentor a Cricket Australia XI in a four-day Ashes tour match in Townsville next month.
Hick played 65 tests for England around the turn of the century and is currently Australia’s batting coach, while Cooley was England’s bowling coach in the lead-up to their 2005 Ashes breakthrough triumph before returning home.
The tour match, which will take place in the tropical Queensland city from Nov. 15-18, is one of three England will play before and during the Ashes series.
Former Australia pace bowler Ryan Harris will coach the CA XI in the first four-day match under lights at the Adelaide Oval from Nov. 8-11, while John Davison will lead the locals in the third in Perth from Dec. 9-10.
Former test opener Chris Rogers will assist both Harris and Davison, who is Australia’s national spin-bowling coach.
“These matches will see Australia’s talented young players testing themselves against a world-class opponent in England, surrounded by coaches who have worked at the national level,” said CA’s Pat Howard.
