Over 90 percent women face sexual harassment in public transport

Sexual harassment against women on public transport is one form of gender-based violence. In order to address the issue of gender-based violence (GBV) at large, nationwide data should be gathered to assist in formulation of evidence-based policies, said the Representative-designate of the The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), Ritsu Nacken.
She made this comment yesterday during a news conference at the U.N. Compound to announce the findings of its nationwide study on the prevalence and effects of sexual harassment on public transport. The UNFPA also presented a policy brief to the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs.
The study, which covered 2,500 women between the ages of 15-35 from every district, found that 90 percent of women and girls in Sri Lanka have suffered some form of sexual harassment while on public buses and trains. Of those, only four percent sought help from the police.
“Sri Lanka needs to strengthen its response systems and promote positive behavioural change. It also must empower victims to speak up and bystanders to intervene so that perpetrators are held accountable,” she said.
Swarna Sumanasekera, Chairperson, National Committee on Women, said the Ministry of Women’s Affairs is concerned about the issues and is working on action plans to spread awareness about sexual harassment while trying to prevent it. The policy brief recommended engaging stakeholders for policy interventions, strengthening response and grievance mechanisms, empowering women and girls to speak out, encouraging bystander interventions, and sensitizing drivers and conductors to take action and prevent harassment.
Paba Deshapriya, of Grassrooted Trust, said it was important to educate young children, especially boys, about gender equality in order to limit sexual harassment. Nacken ended the conference by mentioning the need to make men and boys allies in the fight against gender-based violence. “Sexual harassment is not a women’s or girl’s issue, but the whole country’s issue. We need to engage men and boys as solution makers and partners to address this problem, as it is society’s problem,” Nacken said.
