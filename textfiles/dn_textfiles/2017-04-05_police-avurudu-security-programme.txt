Police Avurudu security programme

The Sri Lanka Police will launch a crime and accident prevention programme from April 4 to April 29 to minimise incidents of crime during and after the upcoming festive season. Police Spokesperson DIG Priyantha Jayakody addressing a media briefing at Police Headquarters yesterday said Police teams dressed in civil would be deployed to monitor shoplifters and thieves targeting unsuspecting shoppers.
“People also tend to leave their homes unattended for long periods during this time and thus we ask that they take precaution to keep someone on watch at home or take other necessary precautions when they have to go out often. Also do not keep too many valuables and cash at home”, warned the DIG and asked that people be careful in handling large amounts of cash when shopping as this would catch the eye of potential thieves.
