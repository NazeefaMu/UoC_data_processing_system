Raomal Perera inducted into Hall of Fame

A Sri Lankan now domiciled in Ireland, Raomal Perera, was inducted into the Business Excellence Institute’s Hall of Fame at the Shelbourne Hotel in Dublin, Ireland on April 19, 2018.
He co-founded ISOCOR, which was listed on the NASDAQ in 1996, and also founded the Irish software company Network 365 (later renamed Valista), which won the Wall Street Journal Innovation Gold Award for business and was listed by Time Magazine as one of Europe’s Hottest Tech firms in 2001 and 2002. He became an Adjunct Professor at INSEAD in 2007 and in UCD in 2014 and started his third venture, Lean Disruptor, in 2015.
“On behalf of the Irish technology sector, I would like to warmly congratulate Raomal on his induction to the Hall of Fame. Raomal is a true patriarch of the Irish software sector and in many ways can be credited with the great successes we see in the sector today.
Raomal has given selflessly of his time in supporting a new generation of entrepreneurs, helping others learn from his trailblazing achievements. Many congratulations Raomal,” said Paul Sweetman, Director of Technology Ireland at IBEC, the Irish Business and Employers Confederation.
