Record price for St. James Pekoe1

Three Invoices of Pekoe1 were sold under the St. James mark at the tea auction on August 16 at a price of Rs. 1350/- per kg.
The two Invoices sold by Asia Siyaka Commodities PLC were purchased by Tea-Link Colombo (Pvt) Ltd and the third line of Pekoe1 was purchased by Ceylon Tea Marketing (Pvt) Ltd.
This is probably the first occasion three invoices from the same estate achieved record price levels for the same grade.
Specialty Leafy Orthodox teas made during the current eastern quality season have been attracting good demand with buyers from Japan, UK, Germany, other European and North American markets actively bidding for the seasonal teas on offer. St. James teas are made in the Dickwella Factory, which is part of Malwatte Valley Plantations PLC.
