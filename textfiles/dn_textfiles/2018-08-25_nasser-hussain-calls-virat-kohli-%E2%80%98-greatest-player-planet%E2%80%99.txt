Nasser Hussain calls Virat Kohli ‘the greatest player on the planet’

The world is at a loss of adjectives to describe Indian batting legend Virat Kohli now. The Indian captain hit his second hundred in the third Test of the series against England on Day 3 at Trent Bridge that paved the way for India’s crushing 203 runs win. His 103 off 197 balls was also his 23rd in the format and he is now joint fourth with Virender Sehwag in the list of highest century-makers for India in the whites.
Kohli was showered with praise not just by fans and Indian former cricketers but also by former English captains as well. After Michael Vaughan asserted that he is the best player in the world, another former Three Lions captain Nasser Hussain called him as the greatest player on the planet.
“Kohli might not feel he had a point to prove in England after his 2014 tour but world cricket was waiting to see if he could get runs here to cement himself as a great and be up there with Sachin Tendulkar and Sunil Gavaskar for India,” Hussain wrote in his column for Sky Sports.
HE IS FAR FROM A FLAT-TRACK BULLY
Hussain was also of the opinion that Virat Kohli is not a flat-track bully and the way he has batted in the tough conditions in England has proved it. “He has put any doubts well and truly to bed, with 400 runs in conditions that have been very bowler-friendly. He is far from a flat-track bully. It’s been an outstanding performance from a great, great player.”
“I believe he is the greatest player on the planet right now. I like the balance he has between intensity and having a relaxed nature – he will talk to the umpires, talk to Anderson, Stokes and Jos Buttler but the moment he is on strike, boy, does he switch on,” he further wrote. – ct
