No ban on May Day celebrations on May 1

The government yesterday, announced that there was no ban on trade unions holding May Day celebrations on May 1, although the government had requested that they be moved to May 7.
“We postponed it on the request of the Mahanayake Theras as it falls during the Vesak week,” said Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe, addressing a media briefing held at the SLFP Headquarters in Darley Road, yesterday.
“But others are free to hold their rallies,” he added.
The SLFP Central Committee, meanwhile, accepted President Maithripala Sirisena’s proposal to hold a conference on May 1 instead to commemorate the late SLFP leaders who rendered a great service to the workers’ struggle.
The President had suggested that SLFP leaders such as S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, T.B. Ilangaratne, Alavi Moulana, Ananda Dassanayake, D.C. Weerasekara and a few other SLFP labour leaders be commemorated at the event to be held at the BMICH at 3pm, said Minister Samarasinghe.
The JVP as well as several other leftist parties have already stated that they would go ahead with holding rallies on May 1 as planned.
The SLFP, meanwhile, will hold a rally as their main event on May 7 in Batticaloa. “There will be no march this year,” said Minister Samarasinghe. The Government has, however, gazetted the public, bank and mercantile holiday for May 7.
