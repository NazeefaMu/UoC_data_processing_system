Breathing Canvas

He brings an enchanting vividness to his works on canvas and proves he is an artist par excellence. Bodily curves of damsels let alone pure innocence of children are grasped by him in a magical manner and brought to canvas.
Was there a hint of sadness on a particular lass’s face who had volunteered to pose for a rare portrait The artist responds with a smile, says it is his sheer imagination and not an actual posing by a female. I have reliance on him. His forte is painting the human figure to portray realism. Being a self-made individual, even as a child he has had guts to turn down a one-year scholarship offered by late Mudliar Amarasekara to his art school.
Jayantha Silva the eminent and versatile artist will be unveiling his twelfth art exhibition on May 6 at 8.30 am at the Lionel Wendt. The exhibition will continue on May 7 and 8 from 10am onwards. Daily News interviewed Jayantha with a view to understanding the true temperament of an artiste who is born with inventive abilities.
Q: How do you describe the artist in you
A. Well… I think I was born to be an artist. Born to a Catholic family on Buddha Jayanthi day was significant and that was how my name became Jayantha.
A Buddhist priest who had written my Horoscope had said I would become an artist.
I was a mischievous lad while in school and my passion was drawing. Instead of drawing on paper I drew on walls and floor and annoyed my teachers.
When I was 10 or 11 years old I drew a nude just by imagination. Now as a matured person I myself wonder how I imagined and did that drawing with perfection.
I grew up to become a happy-go-lucky person. I loved to draw figures and was groomed as a figurative artist in time.
Q: About your forthcoming art exhibition
A. This is my twelfth art exhibition. It will be an extension of my earlier exhibitions and will have acrylic and pastel drawings and portraits of human figures. I fancy drawing children, old people and women.
Q: In your drawings of women or damsels you tend to hide the face of the individual. Also there seem to be a touch of sadness in these female’s faces.
A. I never intended to do it with a purpose. May be you got a point there. True temperament of an artist is blended with his works. Drawing figures of curvy ones is a passion of any figurative artist. However I also love to draw children and old people who are the most innocent ones in this world.
Drawing on canvas is like a meditation to me. Even if I start drawing something reluctantly, after some time I create a liking towards it and strive to do the best possible.
Q: How did you become a professional artist
A. It all began with a cake decoration. I had to oblige to one of my mother’s friends request to do a cake decoration for her child’s birthday. It was a horse-shoe having a horse’s face within. It came out well and my name was announced at the party. I was hunting for a job at the time. A person who was at the party who happened to be a big shot in the advertising sphere offered me a job at Zenith Ad agency. During my stint in the advertising field I became a disciplined and professional commercial artist. At the time I would draw even sceneries for requirements of my clients. Eventually I started my own advertising agency.
My passion for drawing figures loomed again after many years and now I resort to drawing figures with more aesthetic attributes.
Q: Do you find this as a lucrative indulgence How do you price your drawings
A. Yes… of course. When I was preparing for my maiden exhibition “Expressions” in 2003 as a fresher I was encountered with this challenge of pricing my drawings.
I asked two people who were very much into the art scene to come and value my drawings. Lucky Peiris and Soma of Chamathkar fame came to Lionel Wendt to price-tag my paintings.
Before doing that Lucky said to me, “Jayantha, you must be good but you a fresher in this sphere. Hence it will take time for value of your paintings to accumulate.” I told him, “Lucky, you price them according to your whims and I will be happy with that”.
His lowest price was 12,000 rupees and highest was 35,000 rupees. I was astonished and felt at that instance, I am going to be an artist loved by people.
I sold about two thirds of my paintings at my first exhibition. Only two known people bought a painting each and the rest were taken by absolutely unknown people.
In Sri Lanka you get quite a lot of art lovers and collectors. They are from all social strata that cut across high net worth clients to ordinary people. The nicest thing is none of them bargain since they know the emotional benefit they are going to derive by possessing a particular painting.
There are regular buyers who call me and ask for new paintings. There is this mature person who collects nudes rich with aesthetic value.
Q: Is there any significance in Sri Lankan faces
A. Yes there is. I had a series of paintings called “Smiles of Sri Lanka” which was very much in demand here and abroad. Even I was inspired by these paintings.
I have held exhibitions in few other countries. I noticed the Sri Lankan smile as a unique thing. It comes from the heart. I draw children and old people to depict this innocence within.
Q: Is there a demand for lustful ones too
A. In Australia I found there is a demand for lustful ones. But I fancy drawing more artistic ones and local art lovers do value those to lustful ones.
Q: Were you inspired by any local or foreign artist
A. Never. However I admire works of Leonardo da Vinci, Picasso let alone our own Senaka Senanayake. Picasso was a fantastic figurative artist before becoming an abstract artist.
He at the helm of his career could draw a curvy line or a circle and sell it for millions.
He was not selling the drawings but his signature. This depicts the magic and stature of an artist.
