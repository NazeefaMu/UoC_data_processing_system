More emphasis on educating children - Akila

International Literacy Day falls on September 8:
Several programmes will be implemented to mark the International Literacy Day on September 8 to increase the local literacy rate, Education Minister Akila Viraj
Kariyawasam said.
According to the Child Activity Survey conducted by the Census and Statistics Department, the number of children who had not attended school from January to May 2016 amounted to 452,661.
“This does not mean that all of these students have stopped schooling.The majority of 236,819 out of 452,661 students were awaiting the G.C.E O/L results and most of them started schooling once the results were released, Kariyawasam said.
Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo, he further said that there were around 77,730 students who were not interested in formal education. But, they may enter to other streams like vocational training or the labour force. However, the Education Ministry has set up supervisory committees with the help of Grama Niladhari officers, Police officers, Midwives and Development officers with the aim of sending these students back to schools.
He further said around 4,154 children are not attending the schools due to financial problems. We expect to provide them special allowances under the foster parent’s scheme in the future. This will be included to the budget 2018 as a proposal after discussing with the Finance Minister.
From 2018 onwards, even students who fail the GCE O/L examination will be given an opportunity to sit the GCE A/L,” he added. This will be implemented as a pilot project and students who have faced the O/L examination this year will give a chance to select three subjects out of 26 subjects. Students can select a subject of their preference out of the ones available in their schools. The idea here is to believe and highlight the child’s hidden talents.The important thing to understand in these circumstances is that some of children inborn talents cannot be measured through GCE (O/L) or (A/L) examinations.
So, they will now have a chance to select their prefer subjects on their skills and talents.
Another milestone is introduction of the health insurance scheme covering all students in government schools, non-aided or aided private schools, Pirivena schools and international schools. The health scheme for students was a 2017 Budget proposal and the government had allocated Rs 2.7 billion for this purpose.
