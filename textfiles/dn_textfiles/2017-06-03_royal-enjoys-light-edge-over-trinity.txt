Royal enjoys light edge over Trinity

73rd Bradby Shield second leg at Royal Sports Complex:
Royal College will have a slight edge over Trinity College, Kandy when they scrum down in the second leg of the 73rd Bradby Shield rugby encounter at the Royal Sports Complex today. The junior game for the C. E. Simitharachchi trophy will be played prior to the first XV encounter.
The two teams look almost even but Royal has a slight edge due to having a five points lead winning the first leg (22-17) up in Pallekele, Kandy as well as they are playing front of their home crowd in Colombo. Nevertheless, Trinity too will make every effort to beat the Royalists in their own den. The team that takes control of the game within the first 30 minutes should hold the key to winning the Bradby Shield in this much looked forward to encounter.
The outcome of the second leg would mainly depend on how the Trinity three quarters will make use of the good ball. Trinity has always enjoyed the luxury of speedy and penetrative set of three quarters and there is no exception this time too. If the Trinity forwards could secure the good ball and feed their three quarter line more often, then Royal will face a tough task.
Nevertheless, Royal has its own strength to give the Lions a testing time as they could boast of a mobile eight who will use their heavy forwards to score through the famous rolling maul. When one talks about the success of Royal forwards, it goes back to that invincible side of Royal 2015 with their unsung hero (highest try scorer in the league that year) and rolling maul specialist number eight Supun Warnakulasooriya who scored four back to back tries in the second leg at the Royal Complex. Incidentally he is the present Royal rugby team manager.
Going down memory lane Royal had its best pack in 1988 when burly number eight Lasitha Gunaratne (Bonza), coached by late Dr. Fred Perera (one of the best school’s rugby coaches who captained the Reid Avenue school in 1971), produced a champion unbeaten side that won the league and the R. Premadasa Trophy knockout by beating Isipathana (13-0). They also went on to win both their games against Hong Kong school side and a Combined Schools team in Hong Kong during their tour of the island nation. They lost only the Schools rugby 7s to Sudesh Abeysinghe’s Isipathana College.
Experienced fly half and playmaker Ovin Askey will captain Royal who will make every effort to humble the Lions in Colombo to retain the Bradby Shield for the third consecutive year. But all will depend on how their granite hard forwards will play today.
Royal has enjoyed a fabulous season this year having won all their matches against St. Joseph’s College Maradana (28-22) , St. Peter’s College Bambalapitiya (17-10), Dharmaraja College (18-15), D.S. Senanayake College ( 47-7), St. Anthony's Kandy (48-35), S. Thomas’ College (31-14), Zahira College (65-14), Wesley College (35-19), Trinity College (22-17) and losing only one match to Isipathana College (17-22) to crown themselves 2017 Singer league rugby champions.
In contrast, Trinity had their best team in recent times in the year 1987 as the Lions remained unbeaten under Tyrell Rajapakse coached by Alex Lazarus. The forte of Rajapakse's undisputed team was that they had a speedy back division led by playmaker cum one of the best fly halves the country has produced todate in Shah Doole (now domiciled is USA) that injected superpower to 1987 Trinity outfit.
Leading Trinity in the 2017 Bradby second leg will be number eight Nathan Yee. Trinity has a slightly good record this season placed third in the 2017 Singer league, though they too have failed to remain unbeaten. Trinity has seven wins to their credit winning against Wesley College (64-27) , Science College (52-7), Zahira College (34-26), S. Thomas’ College (29-14), Prince of Wales’ College (94-9), St. Joseph’s College (30-25). Isipathana College (15-10) with St. Peter's spoiling their unbeaten record after a closely fought out battle (13-15) and finally Royal beat them as well to secure the league crown 17-22.
The Bradby Shield encounter is considered the most prestigious match in schools rugby, even surpassing any of the tournament matches. It has a rich history which is second to none when it comes to the sport of rugby. The series is played in honour of former Royal principal, the late E.L. Bradby, since 1945. However the Royal-Trinity inter-school rugby series had begun way back in 1920, long before the Bradby Shield was introduced and turned out to be a ‘two-leg’ affair.
The first ever inter-school rugby match between the two teams in 1920 was won by Trinity, crushing Royal 26 points to nil. The first leg of the inaugural Bradby Shield encounter in 1945 was won by Royal 3-0 but their joy was short lived as Trinity won the second leg 6-0 and with it became the first holders of the Bradby, awarded on aggregate of points after two matches in Colombo and Kandy.
Of the 72 encounters to date, Trinity takes the lead with 39 wins to Royal’s 31 and there were two ties in the series in 1992 (3-3) and (0-0) and in 2016 (22-17) and (13-18). Over the years, it has produced many top Sri Lanka players and traditions that could only be witnessed at the Bradby Shield encounter.
Whatever the outcome of the game may be, one guaranteed factor is that the thousands of rugby fans who will fill the Royal Complex grounds to capacity are assured of a game of fast open rugby.
Subramanium Sujamthakumar, the captain of Royal’s rugby team in 1980, skipper of CH and FC 1983 and former Sri Lanka scrum half now domiciled in USA, will be the chief guest at today's second leg. Today’s big encounter at Royal complex will be refereed by Rohan Fernando.
