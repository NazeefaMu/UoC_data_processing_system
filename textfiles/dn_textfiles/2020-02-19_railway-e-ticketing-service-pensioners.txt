Railway E-Ticketing service for pensioners

Sri Lanka Railways has introduced E-Ticketing system to facilitate the reservation of railway seats for pensioners with railway warrants.Accordingly, pensioners who have railway warrants will be able to reserve their railway seats directly through online or by producing either their Pension ID or the national ID or 48 railway stations across the country including the Fort railway station from today.Earlier, the Railway Department issued railway warrants to pensioners on the recommendations from the Grama Niladhari and the Divisional Secretariat.Now, pensioners can reserve their railway seats directly producing pension ID and National ID  to the relevant railway station without visiting the Grama  Niladhari official and Divisional Secretariat..Passenger Transport Management and Power and Energy Minister Mahinda Amaraweera today launched this service at the Fort Railway station and issued the first train ticket for one of the pensioners.Addressing the gathering at the ceremony, the Minister said, this service will cause great conveniences to the pensioners in the country. They have earlier been severely inconvenienced due to complicated and lengthy process.
