Rajitha pledges commitment to uplift nursing profession

The new Nurses Faculty which can train 2,000 nurses at once will be established at Sri Jayawardenepura and the hostel will be constructed at Mulleriaya, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Addressing the International Nurses’ Day held in Colombo recently, he said for the first time, the proposal to offer a nursing degree was present in 2002. Until then no trade union declared it. The Doctors Association opposed the idea of offering a nursing degree to nurses, he said.
According to Minister Senaratne, young nurses do not know how the nursing profession in Sri Lanka reached the current status. “They should be educated on the history of nursing. The trade unions should have a broad minded view on issues and they should be active. Name boards alone will not do anything,” Senaratne said.
Regarding the accusation made by Public Service United Nurses Union President Ven. Muruththettuwe Ananda Thera about the Acting Director General of Health Services, Senaratne said he wanted to develop the nursing profession and requested the support of the Thera.
