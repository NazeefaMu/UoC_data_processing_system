Sampath Bank launches Wewata Jeewayak program

As a Bank that takes pride in its Sri Lankan roots, Sampath Bank has always appreciated the immense value that the Wewa system adds to the country. Right from its inception, the Bank has been working with authorities and local communities to restore tanks around the island through its “Wewata Jeewayak” program.
As part of its “Wewata Jeevayak” initiative, the Bank joined hands with the Divisional Irrigation Engineer’s Office, Minneriya, and the Divulankadawala Govi Samithiya to restore the Danyawa Wewa in Divulankadawala, Medirigiriya, recently.
The Divisional Irrigation Engineer Minneriya, officers of the Divisional Secretariat Office, other senior government officers and representatives of the Govi Samithiya were at the ceremonial inauguration of the project together with officers and customers of Sampath Bank and members of the Madirigiriya and Higurakgoda communities.
Today, the Danyawa Wewaserves as the main irrigation source for 96 families carrying out farming on over 112 acres of paddy fields across 3 villages in the region. Its streams provide water for drinking and other household purposes to about 225 families in neighboring villages. Furthermore, students of the Divulankadawala Central College also get their drinking water from the tank’s streams.
The Danyawa Wewa has great cultural significance too with pilgrims on route to Medirigirya during Poson stopping by and having a bath in it.
Over the years, the tank has become shallow due to the accumulation of sludge and the lack of proper maintenance. Its water retention capacity has been further hampered due to damages to the sluice and canal, which has resulted in water leaking through the sluice gate.
Under the Wewate Jeevayak effort, Sampath Bank will provide the funding required for the complete restoration of the tank with members of its Hingurakgoda Branch overseeing the project. They will work together with the Minneriya Divisional Irrigation Engineer’s Office and members of the Divulankadawala Govi Samithiya to remove the sludge accumulated in the tank, repair its sluice gate and construct bathing places. Once completed, it will help secure year round water supply for the Madirigiriya and Higurakgoda communities
“Drawing inspiration from these tanks and other historic traditions, we at Sampath Bank too seek to help people save more and prosper. We are committed to going beyond serving as a trusted financial service provider and adding value to the communities we operate in,” said Lalith Weragoda, Assistant General Manager (AGM) - Human Resources, Sampath Bank.
