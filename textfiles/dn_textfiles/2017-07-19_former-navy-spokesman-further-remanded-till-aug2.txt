Former Navy Spokesman Commodore D.K.P Dassanayake arrested on the charge of aiding and abetting the abduction and disappearance of 11 youths in 2008 and 2009 was today ordered to be further remanded till August 2 by Colombo Fort Magistrate.
The former Navy Spokesman was brought to the Court premises in an ambulance from Welisara Navy hospital. Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne ordered to further remand the suspect after inspecting him in the ambulance.
On July 12, the CID arrested the suspect at the Sri Lanka Navy base in Welisara following an investigation into the incident.

On a previous occasion, the CID informed Court that the 11 persons who were abducted by unidentified groups in Colombo and the surrounding areas in 2008, had been taken to underground detention cells at a navy camp in Trincomalee which were supervised by a Navy Lieutenant Commander.
The missing persons had been abducted by an unidentified group at Dehiwala, Battaramulla and Wattala in 2008 and 2009. The OIC of CID’s Gang Robbery Unit-Inspector Nishantha Silva prosecuted. Counsel Achala Seneviratne appeared for the aggrieved parties.
