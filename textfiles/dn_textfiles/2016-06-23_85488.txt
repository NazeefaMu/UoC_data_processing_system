Cabinet approval a must for release of elephants for processions - Wildlife Minister

Elephants to be used for the purpose of processions for temples and devalas will only be released on the approval of the Cabinet hereafter, said Sustainable Development and Wildlife Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera.
He further said that elephants would be released by a Committee and not even the Wildlife Minister would be permitted to grant such requests.
He made these observations yesterday, in response to a question raised Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Parliamentarian Anura Kumara Dissanayake.
“The government also would take measures to maintain a pool of trained elephants for precessions,” Minister Jayawickrama Perera said. “Elephants that are in custody at present, would not be used for processions as such elephants had been taken after killing the mother elephants and such elephants were living under tension.”
He also said that a procedure would be formulated to release elephants to processions and the elephants would be released only to temples and devalas approved by the President, Prime Minister and the Committee set up for the purpose. He added that discussions have been made with owners of elephants in this connection.
Wildlife Minister Jayawickrama Perera assured that there were enough elephants in the pool to provide for processions. He added that trained elephants would be provided to the Kataragama, Kandy, Aluthnuwara and Vishnu Devala processions that are to be held in the near future.
