Need of an inter-religious dialogue

Religions imbue the people with principles and values particular to each religion. People who have imbibed these from ages past, transmit them to their progeny and they endure through the centuries. People of different religions live side by side tolerant of one another in solidarity and in peace and at times in conflict. Conflict over religion is the worst of conflicts. Without making room for the rule of law we will never be able to protect or even assure the dignity of all our human lives. Any harm done by someone’s thought, word or deed may seem unintended. Harm sometimes seems not purposefully done. Yet injury is injury. And injury, especially injury under cover of religion, should never be allowed.
POLITICAL NEUTRALITY OF TOLERANCE
As for tolerance, we are too tolerant of all the wrong things: bribery, corruption, fraudulence, procrastination, unpunctuality, inattentiveness, inaccuracy, indifference, inefficiency, laziness, neglect, dirtiness, despotism, nepotism, favouritism and dishonesty.
We describe ourselves as a tolerating or tolerant people. Tolerance is like a virtue of tolerating a person or people, a religion or culture we do not like. But when you examine tolerance, it seems an indifferent or a negative attitude. Diverse perspectives of life exist among human beings. We just let them be. ‘Others’ don’t matter to us. Most of us don’t do any positive harm to others, nor do we do any positive good. We repel any desire to proscribe any activity disagreeable to us as long as it does not physically fetter us.
We show indifference to the public wrong and social harm others do, do we not even under legal cover? Wrongful damage may however take place: the positive good such as upholding the law is neglected, punishment to wrong doers is delayed and omitted. There are groups of trouble makers who disturb the peace and hide themselves in a cowardly manner when the law catches up with them. Intellectual approach has little effect on them as they are moved by prejudice and frenzied emotion. Vacillation on the part of the powers that be encourage the anarchists to fish in troubled waters.
In general we think of tolerance as a virtue even though we are uninterested, uncaring, unsympathetic and unmoved by the ignorance, poverty, hunger and thirst, helplessness and indigence of the other. Perhaps, we may not consider him or her a brother or sister or even as a ‘neighbour’.
Nevertheless, every individual is independent, autonomous and self-determining and deserves respect. The idea that one should be free and let others too be free is generally accepted. Yet that no one should coerce anyone else to act one way or another as regards one’s decisions, beliefs, while it is accepted today among some urbanized and cultured people, is not accepted by some others, even among urbanized and educated people.
Everyone should be accorded the rights of human dignity and the freedom to know and follow one’s own interests and pursue one’s own way of life according to one's own informed conscience; so each should be tolerated by others.
Tolerance brings about political neutrality on the part of those in political authority and does not control the religious activities of citizens as long as such activity does not become a public annoyance and an exasperation in the public square. In this sense, certain trade union as well as political and religionist activities are an absolute public nuisance.
INTERRELIGIOUS DIALOGUE
Religions have religious scriptures, traditional teachings, ethics and morals, rites, celebrations, peaceful public proclamations and demonstrations, patterns of behaviour and motivations behind them.
In the context of Sri Lanka and many countries of the world, inter-religious dialogue is of crucial importance. In inter-religious dialogue one discovers a world view, the Weltanschauung, particular to each religion. In sincere dialogue we discover that which is good, true, beautiful and holy in other religions and begin to appreciate it.
What Pope Benedict said in August 2005 to the representatives of Muslim Communities in Cologne, Germany is very relevant to us also. He stressed the “need to approach…inter-religious and intercultural dialogue with optimism and hope. It cannot be reduced to an ‘optional extra’. On the contrary it is a vital necessity on which in large measure our future depends”. He was not just expressing an opinion but speaking as Pope, he was stating the public stand of the Catholic Church on the matter.
When religious leaders see to inter-religious dialogue seeping down to the ordinary rank and file of the followers of the four main and even other religions of our country, they will come to be more open to the believers in religions other than their own and come to appreciate that which makes those followers good persons who go after what is true and beautiful. Each one also needs to be aware that dialogue is between persons who are not perfect at all.
Pope Benedict XVI had written when he was yet a Cardinal, “What is required …is reverence to the other’s belief along with the willingness to seek truth in what I find alien – a truth that concerns me and that can correct me and lead me further. What is required is to look behind what may appear strange in order to find the deeper reality in concrete.
I must also be willing to let my narrow understanding of truth be broken open to learn my own beliefs better by understanding the other, and in this way to let myself be furthered on the path to God, who is greater – in the certainty that I never wholly possess the truth about God and am always a learner before it, a pilgrim whose ways to it is never at an end”. (Instead of ‘God’, some use ‘Absolute’).
Truth and beauty are simply too profound, too transcendent, to infinite, too immense, too unfathomable, for any one person or one people, no matter which religion they belong to, to possess fully.
Simply put we need one another in our research for what is good and holy, for what is true and beautiful. But the teaching is also meant to expose those who approach dialogue in an opportunistic spirit for personal gain, and not just in the area of worldly politics but also in the world of religious politics. (Edward J. Alam, since 1996, Professor in the Faculty of Humanities of Notre Dame University, Louaize, Lebanon. Vidyajyoti Journal of theological Reflection, May 2016, p. 383).
In any community, teachings of the Religions, based on right reason, is important and cannot be overlooked. On right reason depends on the direction of the scientific culture and technological societies and even professional associations, political establishments and governments that control and direct the socio-economic, banking and financial, trade and commercial development system. Any system could be turned away from inevitably possible evil and much harm and injustice to people only through the intervention of ethics and morals emanating from religious norms and guidance.
Advanced human sciences too need the guidance of ethics and morals to stay on course lest they drift to totalitarian despotism to provide solutions to human problems by unacceptable methods of social engineering. When religions themselves and religious leaders depart from ethics and morals and teach in their schools distorted principles, norms, standards and social models, public chaos can result. Even terrorism is justified by some religious leaders and this is unacceptable.
RELIGIONS TURNING EVIL
It is therefore important that through interreligious dialogue, religions remain unsullied, uncontaminated by misreading, misinterpreting, misunderstanding the scriptures and the teaching of the doctrine over the centuries and by impurities of the practices of adherents accumulated through the ages.
One should be ready to accept that where flawed human beings convene together, discuss, decide and act, and adopt a system of doctrine or belief, or even any law they could fall short of good understanding, make mistakes, commit blunders and decide badly, accumulate customs and traditions that could ultimately lead them to uphold and follow falsehood, do wrong, even gather filth, commit injustice, lead others into long lasting error and sad estrangement.
This happens not because the precious pearls of the religions have lost their lustre, but because flawed human beings in their pride and arrogance have perverted idealism and covered the pearls with the mud, dirt and the filth of their own lives and visions. This has happened in the history of religions and it is happening today.
Religions can veer away from her pristine path under corrupt political patronage which extends economic support sometimes and exerts subtle pressure on religious leaders to compromise on principles of religion and religious positions. It is indeed a tragedy when religions themselves turn to evil, and drive some adherents to practice evil and commit crime and shed blood, and in the name and authority of religion, cause sad tears to flow from the eyes of the innocent men, women and children.
This is happening not only among the ISIS but it is also happening among Sri Lankan citizens because some notorious religionists force themselves into the establishments of others, disrupt government departments and disturb even courts of law disregarding not only courtesy and good behaviour but even the tenets of their own religion, the guidance of their own leaders and the law of the land. They interpret all other positions contrary to their rigid stand and the law of the land itself as arbitrary impositions and therefore disregard it.
What can cleanse such practice of religion and the adherents of such a religion? If the religious leaders wish to incorporate into their religion an expression with a character alien to and in disharmony with its original essence and rightful heritage, what can restore it to its pristine self and authority? If the salt loses its flavour, what can make it salt again? It is only fit to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men. (Gospel of Matthew Ch.9, v 50)
AUTONOMY, RECOGNITION
Religions are not a substitute in place of the knowledge of truth and empirical knowledge through human sciences and of civil law. “Sciens” in Latin means the knower and “scientia” means knowledge. Though religions have inspired education and the establishment of higher institutes of learning, the widening and deepening of knowledge and understanding, religions are not a substitute for universities of the arts, the various sciences, medical science, law, sociology, economics, banking, financial and commerce studies, which should maintain their own autonomy.
Autonomy does not mean they are independent of all or any human approach. In serving humanity, they need to dialogue with human beings.
Then there is the occurrence and manifestation of recognition. One is recognized in a bus or train, in the market place, in a crowd, as someone dedicated to a cause, as a seeker, as a friend, a fellow pilgrim on the journey of life. Recognition also helps identify and name who we are and what value is shown in our regard.
And so in a multicultural, multi religious, multi lingual society one could focus on recognizing, accommodating and respecting a variety of different values that enhance society.
RELIGIONS DIALOGUE STABILIZES
Dialogue is a discussion, an exchange of views between two persons or groups of persons, often on matters of mutual interest.
Today a wide range of dialogue on a variety of topics takes place in the newspapers, in the mass communications media.
A conversation rooted in religions could take place an ideas exchanged on views on religions, religious doctrines and teachings. Religion’s place is in society, not confined to the enclosure of the place of worship.
Co-existence among religions, cooperation between religious persons, religions promoting community understanding, social justice, stability and peace come about through the right practice of one’s religion. Propagation of any religion should never become a conflict-creating competition; friction need not arise in religious persuasion.
Distortionists of religion tend to undermine truth, justice and fairness and other human values to collect followers to their religious tradition. Distortionists arbitrarily distort the interconnection between fundamental principles of a religion and propagate half truths.
The purpose of inter-religious dialogue should be to come to a better mutual knowledge and understanding of the religion and beliefs of other adherents; dialogue is coming to a deeper comprehension, a deeper appreciation of what is good and true, what is of value, what is to be upheld and preserved today and for posterity.
Dialogue helps us to discover in the other the good and the true that we do not have; through dialogue we come to rediscover the good and the true and the holy that we have but have neglected to esteem and appreciate sufficiently. In dialogue we discover the beauty manifested in the other, perhaps in a different form and come to aesthetically appreciate what others treasure.
Through dialogue, all differences, reservations, tensions, dislikes, aversions, doubts and questions, suspicions and worries are not going to disappear. To the extent the climate in which we come together gradually gets cleansed of pollution, becomes unadulterated and purer, to that extent dialogue becomes mutually beneficial to all. Occasions of dialogue establish openness and a mutual availability to speak and to listen, and enhance human solidarity and friendship.
TRUTH OF THE MATTER
Through dialogue we could come to mutually rediscover and uphold common truths that we value. We could come to recognize that we could live according to the truths we uphold. We could come to recognize that we should avoid inter-religious conflict; and that where there could arise tension, we should patiently discern what is true, just and fair and what promotes the common good of all.
We cannot live in unity and peace if we continue to remain unrecognized and unreconciled. We all nurture a hope in our hearts – to be truly free from tension and threat and to be at ease, to be content and to be at peace. Dialogue could become a socially energizing adventure.
In spite of the Government promoting reconciliation, there are government party elements and government servants who in their prejudice and ignorance willfully deny the rights of people and sow dissension and animosity. In spite of the Government declaring zero tolerance for sowing religious animosity, animosity is sown in society today. This has happened at Aluthgama; it is happening, for example, at Siyambalanduwa, Moneragala. The Government has to call some UNP-SLFP party members to order and sanity, because here and there a prominent party man and his followers who are indeed politically insane are moved to unlawfully interfere in civil administration!
Yet people look beyond stupid politicians. And they hope against hope, in the context of present reality which at times is frustrating to say the least. Government should govern and not let rash party men run riot.
