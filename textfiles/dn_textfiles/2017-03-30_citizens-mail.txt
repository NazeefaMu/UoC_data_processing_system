Citizens' Mail

Rental free Supranormal SIM!
I thought of sharing how I have been taken for a ride by a leading mobile operator. I got a rental free SIM some time ago which I didn’t use for a couple of months but I was billed monthly (although the SIM was not used) which I promptly settled for the reasons adduced by the representatives of this Company.
About 4-5 months ago, when I brought to the attention of the Customer Service Executive at one of the branches located down Duplication Road, Colombo 3 as to why I was charged when the SIM was not made use of, he told me after browsing through his computer that it had been used at such and such time on so many days for so many minutes as per their records.
And the following month I got another bill and when I queried as to their charge, I was told that when the SIM is kept in a smart phone it automatically gets connected to internet even without logging for internet. So, it showed once again in their computer that the SIM had been made use of.
Once again I got another bill when the SIM was kept in a normal phone which itself was out of order. Here again, the Customer Service Executive told me that the SIM had been used for downloads as per their records. Once more I paid the bill as the charges were nominal.
Finally I decided to remove it from the phone and kept it unused inside the drawer. Believe me; I was billed again for downloading charges which I have not paid and has send them a letter asking for a refund of all the payments made to date and also to carry out a detailed investigation as regards their bogus charges.
Is this a miraculous SIM, I wonder? This particular SIM seems to me to be an extra-ordinary one for it works being kept in the drawer under lock and key without being inserted into the phone!
This is to caution other mobile subscribers to monitor their monthly bills very closely for they may be getting charged for calls / internet when it has not been made use of in case the SIM becomes supranormal as it had happened to me.
Over to TRCL and CASL to carry out spot raids and check their billing systems!
