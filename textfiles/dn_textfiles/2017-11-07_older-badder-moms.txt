Older, badder  moms!

The cast of “Bad Moms” had such a good time filming their 2016 hit comedy, they immediately jumped at the chance to make a holiday-themed sequel, “A Bad Moms Christmas”.
Stars Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell and Kathryn Hahn tell ET Canada’s Matte Babel they didn’t even have time to be apprehensive about jumping on board a second film.
“We didn’t have any time… you don’t understand. We went from one to two,” Kunis admits.
The 34-year-old actress filmed “Bad Moms”, gave birth to her second child with husband Ashton Kutcher and went back to work filming the sequel. “It was like, ‘Now take a deep breath. Pop out a baby. And have a movie,'” the actress says, taking a deep breath. “I got pregnant the day we wrapped. And I was on-set with a 3-month-old.”
While the production wasn’t put on hold for Kunis to return, she says it was worth it to return to work earlier than she planned. “I mean I went to work a little bit earlier than I anticipated. It was a little earlier than I wanted to. But, it was a great movie and it needed to be told and the story was awesome and I got to work with these girls, so my kid got schlepped with me and they had to suffer though a lot of [breast] pumping,” she laughs.
Their new sequel pairs the “Bad Moms” with their own mothers for the holidays, casting Susan Sarandon, Cheryl Hines and Christine Baranski as their opinionated mothers who arrive just in time for Christmas. While their on-screen moms are eager to impart their holiday wisdom, Bell, Hahn and Kunis have some holiday traditions of their own. ET
