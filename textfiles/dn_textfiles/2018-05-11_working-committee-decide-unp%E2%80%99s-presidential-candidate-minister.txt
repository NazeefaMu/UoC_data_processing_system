Working Committee to decide UNP’s Presidential candidate - Minister

The Presidential candidate of the United National Party (UNP) for the next election will be decided by the Working Committee at the appropriate time, Lands and Parliamentary Reforms and co-Cabinet spokesman Gayantha Karunathilake said yesterday.
Karunathilake said the UNP’s next Presidential candidate will be decided by the Working Committee at the last moment.
Responding to the same query, Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister and Cabinet Spokesman Rajitha Senaratne said he discussed the matter with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who held the view that a common candidate should be the next candidate.
Minister Senaratne said that the Premier is well aware of the political strategies and he is not a narrow minded politician. He added that the President himself might be the next common candidate or someone else.
