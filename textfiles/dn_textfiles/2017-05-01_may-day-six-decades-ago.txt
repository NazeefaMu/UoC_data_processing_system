May Day SIX DECADES ago

The International Workers’ Day (also known as May Day), is celebrated worldwide on May 1 to remember the struggles of the labour movement of the past and present. It has been celebrated by marches and other activities in Sri Lanka since 1927. Some of these activities have evolved with the passing of time.
Sri Lanka's first May Day celebrations were initiated by the late A. E. Gunasinghe who formed the Labour Party to ensure workers' rights.
The formation of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) in 1935 was a landmark as far as Sri Lanka's May Day celebrations were concerned.
Leftist giants such as Dr. N.M. Perera, Colvin R. de Silva, S.A. Wickremasinghe, Peter Keumeman and Phillip Gunawardane were at the forefront of May Day rallies after the formation of leftist parties in Sri Lanka.
Their May Day rallies brought forth the fighting spirit and the revolutionary aspirations of the working class.
May Day was declared an official holiday in Sri Lanka in 1956 under the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna government, led by former Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike. He also appointed centre-left politician T.B. Ilangaratne as the labour minister of his new government.
The May Day holiday allowed hundreds of thousands of workers across the country to participate in May Day rallies and extend their support to political leaders.
Many believe that the biggest May Day rally in Sri Lanka was the one held by J.R. Jayewardene at the Galle Face ground, in 1977.
The manner in which Sri Lankan political parties celebrated May Day changed drastically over the past few decades. It is a widely held belief that political interests have taken over workers' interests in May Day rallies nowadays. It has become an event for political parties to flex their muscles and pompously show off their support-bases.
Here, we look at how the Daily News reported the activities on May Day in the late 1950’s.
