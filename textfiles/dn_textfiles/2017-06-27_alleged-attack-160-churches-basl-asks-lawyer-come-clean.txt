Alleged attack  on 160 churches: BASL asks lawyer to come clean

 Attorney-at-Law Lakshan Dias who alleged that nearly 160 churches in the country had come under attack has been ordered by the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) to elucidate on his statement by naming each and every church so attacked individually through an affidavit.
The order has been communicated to Dias in Writing said Bar Association President U.R.de Silva.
“This is in keeping with a decision taken by the Association at its monthly meeting,” he said.
The letter addressed to Dias was signed by Association Secretary Attorney at Law Amal Randeniya. Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe too has vehemently condemned this
statement made by Attorney-at-Law Lakshan Dias through an electronic media channel.
The Justice Minister had asked the Bar Association to take disciplinary action against Attorney-at-Law Lakshan Dias if he failed to contradict this irresponsible and unfounded statement.
