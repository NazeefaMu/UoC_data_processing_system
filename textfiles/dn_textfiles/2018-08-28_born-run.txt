Born to run

A dog dubbed the "Usain Bolt of pugs" was crowned the fastest of her breed after running a 50-meter race in just six seconds.
Emma is a four year old pup who just loves to zoom. She was one of 60 dogs who competed in the International Pug Race, held in Berlin on August 18, where pups and their owners from around the world gathered to celebrate the speediest pugs. Emma completed the 50 meter dash in less than six seconds, making her the clear winner.
Pugs aren’t generally famed for their athletic abilities, being bred neither as working dogs nor watchdogs. They’ve got adorably chunky, loaf-like little bods and short, stubby legs – not to mention the squashy face and (less cute) breathing problems which can accompany it.
Most pugs won’t be invited to the doggy Olympics anytime soon and the average speed of a pug (depending on age and health) is between three and five miles per hour.
However, Emma’s need for speed set her apart from the other contestants. Although some pugs struggled to compete the 50 meters in under 40 seconds and others got adorably distracted and ran the wrong way, Emma flew across the finishing line.
Her little eyes were aflame with the impending glory of winning first place and with unadulterated love for the pure act of zooming.
Her time meant that she was running at an approximate speed of 18.6 miles per hour, well above the average for ordinary puggos.
This was the ninth annual International Pug Meeting, and it remains to be seen whether Emma will defend her title for the fourth year running in 2019.
