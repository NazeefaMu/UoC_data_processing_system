Asylum seeker on Nauru jailed after attempting suicide

 
Refugee advocates are concerned for a Sri Lankan asylum seeker on Nauru who has been jailed after he attempted to commit suicide at the detention centre there.
The Tamil Refugee Council, based in Australia, says the 30-year-old man climbed up a tree where he stayed for nine hours on Sunday, and was threatening to jump.
The Council's spokesperson, Aran Mylvaganam says his refugee application was rejected recently, after being in detention for two and a half years.
Mr Mylvaganam told Mary Baines detention centre workers told the man he would receive help if he came down, but when he did, the police arrested him.
 A 30-year-old Tamil asylum seeker on Nauru climbed up a tree on Sunday at 9am local time and threatened to commit suicide unless his family is released from detention into Australia. The man came with a five year old daughter and his wife. We have received photographs of the incident. While the man was on the tree, there were guards at the bottom of the tree and as part of the onlookers were the wife and the five-year-old child, we were able to see in the photos the five-year-old child was crying looking at her dad threatening to commit suicide. At about 6pm local time the guards convinced the man to come down with the promise that he would get a positive response within 24 hours. As soon as he came down Nauruan police came and arrested him and he is in jail at the moment.
