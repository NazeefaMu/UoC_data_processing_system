SLFP unveils election manifesto

The United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) yesterday released its Local Government Election Manifesto titled “Nation and People for Empowered Freedom” which outlines 20 priorities that the party would like to see enacted after the local government elections in February.
Addressing the media yesterday at the SLFP Headquarters, SLFP National Organizer and Science, Technology and Research Minister Susil Premajayantha said that the UPFA has already prepared election flyers to share the manifesto with voters and plans to distribute them to each house within next two weeks.
The Minister said that the local government body is not just an administrative bodybut is also responsible for providing services which the law specifically allows it to perform, including regulatory and administrative functions, promotion of public health and environmental sanitation, overlooking of public thoroughfares and provision of public utility services.
Both political parties and the general public have the responsibility of selecting rural leaders with clean character as people’s representatives in order to fulfill people’s needs, the Minister said.
