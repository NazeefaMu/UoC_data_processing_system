DIMO wins gold at CMA Excellence  in Integrated Reporting Awards 2018

Diesel & Motor Engineering PLC (DIMO) carried away the top honours at the recently concluded CMA Excellence in Integrated Reporting Awards 2018, which was held at Cinnamon Lakeside Hotel.
DIMO also went on to win several more awards at the fourth consecutive CMA Excellence in Integrated Reporting Awards which included: Top 10 Best Integrated Reports, Industry and Commerce Sector, Best Concise Report, and special awards for Value Creation and Capital.
The 2017/18 annual report was DIMO’s eighth consecutive Integrated Report. It was based on the theme of ‘BEING THE CHANGE’, with a diamond as the focus. Diamonds are known for their many qualities of purity, absolute strength and clear, classic beauty; attributes that have guaranteed their value and appreciation over time.
The subsequent process of cutting and transforming a rough stone into a faceted gem combines both science and art, requiring specialised tools, technology and craftsmanship. It is a complex task requiring patience and commitment to the meticulous work of change and transformation that eventually results in the creation of this valuable gem.
This report focuses on those aspects that materially affect DIMO’s ability to create value in short medium and long-term. Our value creation model identifies four broad areas that affects the Group’s ability to achieve its strategic outcomes; Group’s material dependencies and resources, value creation activities, outputs and enterprise governance.
Each section of this report present a comprehensive analysis of material information related to each area of the value creation model together with the Group’s strategy. We believe that the report provide a holistic picture of the organisation and communicate DIMO’s value creation story in its totality.
DIMO has always been a Company of the future. Innovation, creativity and progressive thinking have defined the way DIMO has used their talent and resources to chart their corporate journey.
For over 79 years, DIMO has been at the forefront of Sri Lankan business and industry, simply by being a Company that has lived by its corporate purpose to ‘create value responsibly’. Today, more than ever before, DIMO sees the need for transformative social, economic and environmental change in the way Sri Lankans live, work and look at future.
DIMO is keen to play a part in driving such change and that’s why their future focus includes the broader issues of alternative energy, intelligent mobility, structured farming, climate change and the creation of sustainable value that benefit everyone.
DIMO also understands that a business enterprise can only be economically viable if it is genuinely sustainable.
DIMO recognizes that good business is responsible business and that is why DIMO is investing to build awareness, launching long-term projects and striving to ensure that work and values resonate with DIMO stakeholders, for their belief is what drives DIMO to keep excelling year after year.
