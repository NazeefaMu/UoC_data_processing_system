Sooriya Village: A taste to remember

Being a food enthusiast and being very selective about the food I eat, I find good food irresistible. I must say that while consuming delicious food, in addition to my body enjoying it my mind is transported to different worlds where I pleasantly dwell. I, for one feel that without food the human personality is incomplete.
To me food is one of the most wonderful creations of life. When I was invited to Sooriya Village by Sooriya Village to sample their food, I certainly wondered what that experience would be like. When I visited Sooriya Village I must say that my body and mind responded positively to the food that was on offer. The food in other words was an absolutely mouth -watering mixture of food. Today Daily News critiques the Sooriya Village.
In addition to the food being appealing the right sort of ambience is there as well.
A must have
While you are at the Sooriya Village why not taste its Mini Isso Wade? Now this one was the most eye catching at my table and certainly appetizing. Its brownish tinge gives it a spicy look, which is what one tastes when biting into it. And it was one of the most savory items on the table. The smoked salmon on mini toasties was another food item that I personally feel is one of the best smoked salmon I have tasted.
The Chicken Satay with Peanut Sauce was extremely succulent with that curry like color. The Mini Sausage Puffs/ Mini Fish Buns were also present, but this was of course similar to that which we might find in any posh food outlet. The Devilled Stuffed Eggs were another interesting addition, one that will really attract egg lovers. The Creamy Mushroom and Prawn Vol Au Vaunts really were delectable and a must have for mushroom and prawn lovers.
The Mutton Kebabs with a Chili Mint Dip may not appeal to many, but mutton lovers would not find this food item unwelcome.
The Vegetable Tempura! Ah a welcome addition for those who like vegetables with their meat, and for die hard vegetarians. Just looking at this food item makes one crave this item with its puffed up look and greenish tinge.
Looks good and tastes good
The Mushroom and Asparagus Quiche Squares, has that roasted look and fullness that makes food items at Sooriya Village such enticing. To me it has that ‘pizza’ look.
However the food we were served did not end here. It got better! More and more dishes came our way like some feast hosted by a king or prince. In a way it was a feast hosted by a prince – Koluu. A culinary prince, who makes everyone who come to Sooriya Village special and treated like royalty.
Vegetable Tempura with Tartar Sauce, Devilled Shrimp on Mini Pol Roti, Mini Isso Wade, Mushroom and Asparagus Quiche Squares came on one dish. What an assortment! There were curries on the plate and sauce, and one could dip these items and enjoy these flavors to the maximum.
Finally the spicy delights were replaced by dessert. The mini brownies and Éclairs. The sweetness was a lovely way to end the day after a heavy and superb dinner.
At Sooriya Village the dinner or lunch is something that is well balanced with the right kind of food items. The food looks good and tastes good. Of course the Sooriya Village is not the only one of its kind obviously. There are some top class five star hotels in Colombo.
However this article wishes to say that Sooriya Village is an option if you want to have a lovely dinner out. It is friendly and fun to visit.
