More Lankan companies deploy ‘Cobots’ by Universal Robots

Universal Robots, the pioneers in the manufacturing of advanced, user-friendly and lightweight collaborative robotic arms, (headquartered in Odense, Denmark) perceives huge demand in the Sri Lankan market.
Several Sri Lankan companies have purchased ‘Cobots’ by Universal Robots to boost industrial productivity mainly in the apparel and packaging industries.
After the successful launch of the Sri Lanka operations in 2016, the company deployed collaborative robots (popularly known as cobots), majorly in the market sectors of FMCG and and apparel and other sectors such as rubber gloves.
With the growing demand of collaborative robots in the country, the company is also looking at expanding its customer base in various other sectors.
“Ceylon Biscuits was our latest customer and both UniLever and Hemas Group too have shown keen interest,” Pradeep David, General Manager, Sri Lanka said.
“The company hopes that this can help Sri Lanka with the problem of scarcity of labour to a large extent. Handling of our cobots doesn’t require any prior qualifications and certificates.
Some of our Indian customers like Bajaj Auto and Aurolabs have hired 80% of women employees, who are conveniently working with cobots, where physically challenging parts of the jobs are taken care of by cobots.
We are hoping to replicate the same in Sri Lanka by creating interesting occupations categories such as machine operators and supervisors that would surely increase the willingness of women here to take up those jobs.”
He said that they will also provide more employment for graduates in a bid to meet the increasing demands in Sri Lanka.
Manufacturers want to increase productivity by using available resources optimally, which is one of the reasons they are eager to adopt collaborative robots technology.
The primary goal of Universal Robots is to empower workers by enabling them with smart manufacturing solutions which involves the utilisation of collaborative robots technology and automation.
Sugath Jayatilake, Managing Director, Techfield, Sri Lanka, said, “For a developing country like Sri Lanka, which is looking at a fast pace of development and at the same time would like to adopt cost effective, yet efficient technology, cobots would be the right way to go, especially for the small and medium-sized enterprises.
The strong distribution network, good reach to end customers, strong technical skills of Techfield and the unique product lines of Universal Robots, together envisions a large potential for cobots in the Sri Lankan market.”
The company, which is a part of Teradyne Inc., is headquartered in Odense, Denmark, and has subsidiaries and regional offices in the USA, Spain, Germany, Italy, Czech Republic, China, Singapore, India, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. (SS)
