WISH foundation celebrates  World’s Children’s Day

The world children’s day program certainly lived up to its name as 50 of the Cochlear implant recipients and their families joined together on October 1, at an event hosted by the WISH foundation held at the Wickramaarachchi institute of Speech and Hearing, Nugegoda.
This was a day with beautiful memories and celebration of the innocent. These children who were once born deaf, or hard of hearing are now enjoying the simple pleasures of life. 

“Sri Lanka has done over 600 Cochlear implant surgeries and now it is possible for the deaf community to enjoy the sound of life. It is a joy to see these children live like any other normal child, Thanks to the advance technology of the implants from Cochlear Private Limited,” said CO and founder of WISH, Mihira Wickramarachchi.
The WISH foundation also organized a fund raiser with food and henna/face paint stalls for the local public who generously participated and donated for the cause.
The aim of the fund raiser was to raise money to help the Cochlear implant recipients with the maintenance of their implants along with other services like auditory verbal therapy.
