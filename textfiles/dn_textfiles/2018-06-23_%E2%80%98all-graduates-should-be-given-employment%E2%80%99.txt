‘All graduates should be given employment’

Unemployed graduates should be recruited to employments, Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Youth Front Chairman Shantha Bandara said.
He was addressing a press conference held at the SLFP Head Office on Darley Road, Colombo. The event on the Visanduma Project implementation in August this year was organized by the SLFP Youth Front.
He said country has around 57,000 unemployed graduates and the SLFP Youth Front should suggest President Maithripala Sirisena to recruit them to public service. "They should be recruited to the service since the non compatibility of their education with the job market is not their problem," Shantha Bandara said.
"It is a problem with the education that they had to follow," he said.
.He said the Visanduma project was designed following an year long discussions with youth from all districts including Badulla, Jaffna, Moneragala, Hambantota, Polonnaruwa, and Anuradhapura and it was presented in April in 2017. He said it was mainly designed to eradicate the youth unrest by providing them better employment opportunities.
"The programme would train the youth to cater the existing enormous job market in the country," Shantha Bandara said. "There are many jobs in the country and abroad for our youths," he said.
He said undergrads' qualifications are not fitting for them to get those employments.
"So we set up the Sri Lanka Institute of Career Guidance (SLCIG) and the Institutes of Career Guidance (ICGs) at the provincial levels," Bandara said. "The SLCIG would seek and collect employment opportunities at local and international level and then direct them to the ICGs to provide the training. Then they would be directed to the employments," he said.
SLFP Youth Front secretary Eric Weerawardena and Kalutara District SLFP Organizer Asanka Ediriweera spoke.
