Travel with a cause

The Pimp My Tuk-Tuk Charity (PMTT) ride began on Friday September 15, at 10 am starting from Colombo and will travel across Sri Lanka before returning to Colombo on September 22. The PMTT charity ride which combines tourism with charity is the adventure of a lifetime and also makes a difference in the world. Fifty four riders in 27 tuk tuks committed themselves to eight days of fun and travelling across beautiful Sri Lanka.
The official tour started off in Colombo and will travel across Sigiriya and Mihintale to Trincomalee before travelling down to the East Coast and proceeding via Unawatuna to Colombo (with a special stop at the Foundation of Goodness (FoG) MCC Centre of Excellence in Seenigama, Galle.
Along the way the riders will stop at five destinations to work with the local communities, conducting humanitarian and community development activities including visiting the three Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Plants (RO Plants) built by the group in 2015, 2016 and 2017. They will also be stopping at the Methsawa Special Needs Home in Moneragala, The Foundation of Goodness (FoG) Village Empowerment Centre in Batticoloa and the FoG MCC Centre of Excellence and Sports Academy in Seenigama.
Organized by the Pimp my Tuk Tuk Team, Singapore in partnership with the Foundation of Goodness in Sri Lanka, funds raised by this endeavour will be donated to selected charitable and development projects. Falling in love with the country along the way, the group is also to return to Sri Lanka this year with a bigger group.
What started off as Nick Sutcliff pondering what I want to do for my 50th birthday back in 2013 ended up as a giant project that could become one of the most iconic events in the world. In 2015 earlier there were 40 riders, but this year there are 54 riders. The principal sponsor this year is Accelerasia.
The project is initiated by three people, namely, Candiah Giritharan, Alex Longman and Michael Phelps, who had a vision to start one of the most enterprising projects to help rural folk. The idea was to travel around different countries in tuk tuks. In 2015 they built a water purification plant and through 2016-2017 they have built two more water purification plants and a solar energy project to serve 70 homes. The solar energy project will be provided to a village that has no proper road access. Bicycles have also been provided to students in North and East- for the students to travel to schools, and the villagers to solve their transport problem.
“With the FoG we found that every dollar goes to what we have given it for. You will observe this if you visit the FoG Centre, and you will see for yourselves the immense service that is provided,” said Alex.
Kushil Gunasekera, Founder of the organization, (Foundation of Goodness), which began in 1999 to bridge the gap between the rural and urban populations speaking at the function, said that this project has gone from strength to strength. “Gratitude is the best attitude and kindness multiplies,” he said. The project of Pimp-my Tuk Tuk is one of the best projects that we take on annually or biannually and this was started by the original three, Alex, Giri and Michael.
“This is one of the projects that really touch the heart,” said Media Coordinator for FOG, Swanthri Jayawardene.
“There is a village where there is no electricity on a mountain, where the inhabitants live a very hard life. I think that it is an amazing task and you will find that this is something remarkable. The Pimp my Tuk Tuk Team travels across the country in their tuk-tuks and raise money for worthy causes. We have provided electricity to a remote village that doesn’t have electricity and the bikes for those who do not have any transport and water purification plants to give clean drinking water. I hope that you will come back in 2019 and this could not have been accomplished with out help of so many we are thankful to like Accelerasia our principal sponsor. Every one of you has done so muck for this walk,” Jayawardene said.
