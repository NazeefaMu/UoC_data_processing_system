Land ownership deeds for 10,000 Mahaweli families

The national programme to grant land ownership deeds for 100,000 Mahaweli families took place with the participation of President Maithripala Sirisena at Vilayaya Maha Vidyalaya at Aralaganwila in Polonnaruwa on May 15.
On the occasion, 10,000 families of Mahaweli systems B and C received deeds for the state land in which they have settled in.
The programme is being implemented on a promise given at the presidential and general elections.
Here, making a speech, Minister Daya Gamage said the programme was progressing successfully with the support of Mahaweli officials.
The settlements that began through D.S. Senanayake’s Galoya and Gamini Dissanayake’s Mahaweli movements developed due to the commitment of the settlers, he said.
As a result Polonnaruwa and Ampara districts have been able to produce 40 percent of the country’s rice requirement, said Minister Gamage.
The Korean technology will be provided to raise the production in order to achieve the ability to export rice by next year, he said.
He noted that the Moragaha Kanda movement launched by the President would add 350,000 more hectares of agricultural land.
Minister Gamage added the Ministry of Primary Industries and the Export Agricultural Department would distribute JCT mango, pepper and cinnamon plants among recipients of the land ownership deeds.
