Asanga Rathnayake, Director, MAPS International, addressing his maiden dealer convention said MAPS products became popular in the country within a short stint due to their user friendly nature, affordable prices, durability and credibility.
“MAPS International has a short span of history that is three years. Within this period a heavy demand was created for MAPS products making MAPS a household name. We achieved these heights with the help of our dedicated team of sales agents and partnering companies. Had their support was not forthcoming; we wouldn’t have held this sales agents’ get-together today”, he said.
M K Wijetunga, Director, MAPS International, said the company was commissioned in 2013 and it became a diversified entity within a short span.
“Our sales agents took MAPS brand to fore by stimulating sales. They are the pillars of our success. Excellent standards of MAPS products, technical supremacy and ethical business nature of the company helped these dealers to sell MAPS products without hassle. MAPS Company entered the building construction sphere in the country in 2013. We introduced MAXTREK vehicle tyre in 2014. In 2015 we entered the domestic hydro power pumps market”, said Wijetunga.
