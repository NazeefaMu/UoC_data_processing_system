Royal-Thomian rescheduled

The 139th ‘Battle of the Blues’ cricket encounter between Royal College, Colombo and S. Thomas’ College, Mt. Lavinia, has been rescheduled from Friday (9) to Sunday (11). “The decision had been taken as a mark of respect in view of the Venerable Daranagama Kusaladhamma Thera’s State funeral which is to take place at Independence Square on Thursday,” a statement issued by the Joint Organising Committee for the match said.
The annual Royal-Thomian cricket encounter was previously scheduled to be held on March 8, 9 and 10, 2018 at the Sinhalese Sports Club (SSC) Grounds, Colombo.
