99X Technology Quiz team crowned Champions at Biz Quiz 2017

99X Technology Quiz Team was crowned the Overall Champions at the fifth Glitz Biz Quiz, in addition to sweeping up the Sector Award for the IT and Software Category – retaining this title for the fifth consecutive year.

With the overall title clinched by 99X Technology, Dialog Axiata came in second place followed by SriLankan Airlines and Moody’s Analytics sharing third place. In the IT and Software Category, sector winner 99X Technology was closely followed by IFS and Millennium Information Technologies in second and third places respectively.
The team from 99X Technology was represented by Associate Technical Lead Shirantha De Alwis, who captained the team, Associate Technical Lead Rangitha Kuruppu, Technical Lead SabryMoulana and CEO Apprentice Raveen Ubeysekera.
Initiated by a group of enthusiastic, like-minded employees with a keen interest in general knowledge, the 99X Technology Quiz Team has maintained a constant presence in the mercantile quiz scene over the past several years and continues to make its mark at a number of events annually.
