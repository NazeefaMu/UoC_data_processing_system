Committed to achieve reconciliation, development – High Commissioner

The importance of striving for the twin objectives of reconciliation and development, set out by the Sri Lankan government, was the key in the speech delivered by Sri Lankan High Commissioner to Pretoria, South Africa Sunil De Silva, at the 69th anniversary celebrations of Independence of Sri Lanka, held at the chancery premises recently.
The High Commissioner highlighted the long-standing friendship between South Africa and Sri Lanka which spans even beyond the establishment of formal diplomatic relations in 1994 when Sri Lanka extended its support towards the freedom struggle of ANC through the Non-aligned Movement. He added that Sri Lanka, similar to South Africa, faces the uphill task of reconciliation and economic development in a nation of diverse cultures.
South Africa’s Women in the Presidency Minister Susan Shabangu who was the Guest of Honour spoke on the vibrant bilateral ties between the two countries. She said Sri Lanka and South Africa have remained steadfast friends through the years, reflected by the high-level exchanges and the diverse sectors of cooperation.
The National Anthem was played in Sinhala and Tamil languages and multi-faith observances were made representing all four religions of Sri Lanka at the ceremony. The messages of President, Prime Minister and the Foreign Affairs Minister were read out in all three languages.
Sri Lankan expatriates participated.
