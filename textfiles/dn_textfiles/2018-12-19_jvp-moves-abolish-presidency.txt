JVP moves to abolish Presidency

JVP member Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa moved a motion calling for the abolition of the Executive Presidency yesterday. The motion was debated yesterday and is to be taken up for debate in the House today as well.
Dr. Jayatissa moving the motion said the majority of people want the Executive Presidency abolished. People have understood the disadvantages of this position during the last 50 days, he added. “It is our responsibility not to miss this opportunity.” he said.
Jayatissa also said that it has taken 40 years for all to understand what Dr.N.M. Perera said when the Executive Presidency was introduced.
He said the late Dr. N.M. Perera questioned what would happen if this executive presidency falls into the hands of a mad man, and now after 40 years we understand what he said, Jayatissa told Parliament.
Dr.Jayatissa said people should be allowed to take a decision on the Executive Presidency at a referendum. He also pointed out the 1978 Constitution, which has undergone 19 amendments, have never been brought before the people.
Jayatissa also said that almost all post-1978 election manifestos promised to abolish the Executive Presidency.
Seconding the motion, JVP MP Vijitha Herath said that this is a good time to abolish the Executive Presidency. He also pointed out that the President at present is acting as if he had unlimited powers.
MP Herath also pointed out that there are two myths entertained by the citizens of the country with regards to the Executive Presidency. One of the myths, he said, is the assumption that the Executive Presidency defends the minority of the country. The second, Herath said, is the belief that Executive Presidency stops the country from being divided. “Now, has the executive presidency protected the Tamil, Muslim and other minorities? For over years it has been proved that the post does not. Which post destabilised the country in the last 50 days? It was the executive presidency. Some opportunist politicians have misled our Maha Sangha about this Executive Presidency as well. We kindly urge our Maha Sangha not to be misled by such opportunists.”
MP Herath continued.
Herath also pointed out that the country needs to strengthen national unity and ensure equality for all communities. We should strengthen democracy and with centering power on an individual shall not take us there, Herath added.
Herath said that examples are available from J.R. Jayewardene to R. Premadasa, Chandrika Bandaranaike, Mahinda Rajapaksa and Maithripala Sirisena that the Executive Presidency has failed the people.
The JVP presented to Parliament a bill titled 20th Amendment to the Constitution to abolish the executive presidency last September.
