Commercial Bank  celebrates Avurudu  with war heroes

The annual Sinhala and Tamil New Year celebrations of ‘Ranaviru Sevana,’ the rehabilitation centre in Ragama for disabled war heroes, were supported for the eighth consecutive year by the Commercial Bank of Ceylon, helping the disabled war heroes accommodated at the centre to enjoy a day of fun by engaging in traditional games.
