NEW TECHNOLOGY, CHALLENGE TO SOUTH ASIA - Mangala

Finding the capital and how to absorb the many thousands of people who may lose their jobs with the advent of technology are key concerns for many South Asian countries including Sri Lanka, Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
“Sri Lanka has a very high number of Accountants compared to other parts of the world other than in India. But we have also been told that by 2030, accountants will be redundant with the advent of Artificial Intelligence. We have to prepare ourselves from now on. At the other end of the spectrum,blue collar workers, such as drivers and factory workers are also affected. These are the challenges we are trying to grapple with,” Minister Samaraweera said.
Minister Samaraweera made the above observations participating in a four-member panel discussion on “Technology for Change” on CNBC Global parallel to the 51st Asian Development Bank (ADB) Board of Governors’ Annual Meeting 2018 at the ADB Headquarters in Manila.
ADB President Takehiko Nakao, President of Kickstart Ventures Minnette Navarette and Managing Director of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Nandita Parshad were the other panelists, who participated in the programme conducted by CNBC’s Anchor Oriel Morrison.
The discussion focused on the emerging new technologies and their impact on developing Asian countries.
Samaraweera pointed out that Sri Lanka is still at the second Industrial Revolution and trying to leap into the digital (4th) Industrial Revolution to “catch up for lost time due to three-decade bitter and ruthless war”.
“Unfortunately, as a country we could not harness our full potential because we could not come to terms with the diversity of our own nation. We are trying to catch up for lost time and in doing so it is not that easy because populist slogans are again trying to bring out extreme forms of nationalism to the forefront. They portray technological advances as a threat rather than an opportunity.The challenges before us are monumental, but we are determined to face them strong,” the Minister said.
“The choice before us is whether we are going to enter into a new era of innovation and creativity or into another period high unemployment and anarchy. We have to adjust ourselves as quickly as possible to the changes taking place in the rest of the world. That is why we are promoting ICT education and changing school curriculum,” he commented.
“To absorb young minds to the new technology, the Government has a programme to provide free Wi-Fi to all school and provide tablets to rural school children free of charge. We have selected 14,000 schools as a pilot project for this purpose. In the same time, Farmers’ Unions, Women Societies etc. are also being assisted to adapt to these changes.
As a country we are determined to leap forward into the fourth Industrial Revolution without too many bruises,” he added.
The minister said that people in the rural areas of Sri Lanka have “superstitions” associated with new technology and changing peoples mind-sets are important to overcome such barriers.
“Some people, even among the educated, think of those technologies as a threat rahter than an opportunity,” he said.
Kickstart Ventures President Minnette Navarette giving her opinion on Minister Samaraweera’s remarks on providing free tablets to school children said,adapting to new technologies requires changes to the entire education system than simply providing the computers or the devices.
“We have had an experience where we had donated computers to some public schools and a year later they were still in the boxes. The reason isn’t that the schools did not want them. It was because bringing computers into the schools meant they needed electrification, technicians, maintenance, to be able get Internet to them and the teachers needed to learn how to use them. Yes, make the investments for sure, but also make investments in people to allow them to come into the world of technology with more openness and experience,” she pointed out.
The forum also discussed private sector involvement in technological development and Minister Samaraweera joining in the conversation said Sri Lanka offers very attractive incentives to both local and international investors in the private sector interested in robotics, science and new technologies.
ADB President Takehiko Nakao advised the developing countries to be extra-cautious of the potential risks to fraud and cyber-attack when it comes to financial technology.
