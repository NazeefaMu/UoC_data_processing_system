Rangiri Dambulla Viharaya to stay open for tourists

The Rangiri Dambulla Raja Maha Viharaya will not be temporarily closed down, Asgiri Chapter Registrar Ven. Medagama Dhammananda Thera said.
Conservation activities of the Raja Maha Viharaya will be carried out in a manner which will not create any inconvenience to tourists, the Registrar said at the Asgiri Raja Maha Viharaya yesterday. The Thera said that it is mandatory to conserve the Rangiri Dambulla Raja Maha Viharaya and the conservation should be carried out continuously under the supervision of the Archaeological Department.
“Charges and issue of tickets have to be regulated and supervised by the Buddhist Affairs Commissioner while it is the Government’s responsibility to act on World Heritages,” he added.
Ven. Dhammananda Thera also said that it was important to exchange ideas of all the related parties and discuss prior to taking decisions for these issues.
