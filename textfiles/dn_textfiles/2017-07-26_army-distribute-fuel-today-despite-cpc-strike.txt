Army to distribute fuel today despite the CPC strike

 
The Sri Lanka Army said that they will distribute fuel from today, despite the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) strike.
Security Forces and Police entered the Kolonnawa Petroleum Storage Complex amidst the protesting CPC workers a short while ago.
However the Sri Lanka Army, in a notice assured the safety of the Kolonnawa and Muthurajawela Petroleum Storage Complex.
Meanwhile the government issued a gazette stating that oil distribution is a mandatory service, last night, declaring that whoever fails to report to work will be terminated from service.
These decisions were made in the wake of a strike launched by the CPC unions on July 24.
