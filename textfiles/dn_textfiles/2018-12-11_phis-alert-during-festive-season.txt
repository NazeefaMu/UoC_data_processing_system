PHIs on alert during  festive season

Public Health Inspectors(PHIs) of the Kurunegala and Puttalam districts have made arrangements to inspect all hotels, canteens, restaurants and rest houses in the North Western Province from December 11 to January 10.
The raids will be conducted to take legal actions against the violators of Food Law in the province. It is reported that, during the festive season, some food outlets’ owners serve contaminated food, sweetmeat, cakes and biscuits.
Accordingly, 395 PHIs will be deployed in the Kurunegala and Puttalam districts, senior PHI of the Kurunegala district R. M. Kumarasiri, told the Daily News yesterday.
About 1,256 errant traders and hotel owners who ran unhygienic hotels and shops during the last year festive season were produced before courts, he added.
