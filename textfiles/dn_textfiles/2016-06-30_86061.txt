JAT sponsored Sri Lanka’s inaugural  Premier Tennis League commences today

 
The inaugural Sri Lanka Premier Tennis League (SLPTL) based on the hugely popular International Premier Tennis League (IPTL) will be held at the Queen’s Club courts from June 30 to July 3. The prestigious Queen’s Club of Colombo, a 150 years old hallmark of Colonial Ceylon has undertaken the privilege of organizing this event to showcase the iconic past tennis greats and the illustrious present stars together in action.
JAT Holdings, one of the top conglomerate brands in Sri Lanka has undertaken the mantel of title sponsor for the event while Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT), Cargills, National Savings Bank (NSB) and Crown Paints will sponsor the competing teams.
The teams are SLT Tuskers, Cargills Eagles, NSB Jaguars, and Crown Sharks. JAT and Queen’s Club have collaborated to create an event which will greatly facilitate the sport of tennis to develop to International levels while paving a platform for players to showcase their skills.
It has always given JAT great pleasure in nurturing sportsmen and women who can successfully appear in world sporting arenas. A great sportsman himself who has represented his Alma Mater in many sports, Aelian Gunawardene, Managing Director JAT Holdings said he is both proud and privileged to extend his sponsorship to Tennis as much as he has done with cricket, basketball and hockey.
Among the luminaries participating in the tournament will be leading Sri Lankan men’s players such as the reigning national champion Dineshkanthan Thangarajah, the leading women’s player and six-time national champion Amritha Muttiah and the current women’s top seed Nethmi Waduge. The competition will also be participated by other stalwarts of Sri Lanka’s tennis scene such Yasitha De Silva, Nishangan Nadaraja, Sankha Athukorala Anika Seneviratne, Hasindhi Lokuge to name a few.
JAT’s commitment to grassroot levels sport developments will be showcased by junior players of the caliber of Avindra Perera, Vibudha Wijebandara, Archana Lokuge and Innthujan Selverathnarajah. Their youthful vim, vigour and vitality will challenge the experience of tennis greats of yester years such as Arjun Fernando, Jayendra Wijesekera, Chammika De Silva, Aasiri Iddamalgoda and Ganendran Subramaniam. This clash of stamina verses proficiency is certain to produce a contest of keen tension and spectacle.
The games will be played in a round robin format in which the top two teams will face off in the final on July 3. Each team will consist of a manager, a captain, a men’s player, 2 women’s players, 2 veteran players, a corporate player and a tie will consist of five (5) sets; a men’s singles set, a women’s singles set, an open doubles set, a junior boy’s singles set and a veteran doubles set. The unique nature of this tournament is the change of tennis’ traditional scoring format to single-set no-add scoring, which will speed up the ties and enable the fans to experience the same exhilaration and nail-biting anticipation as limited over cricket.
In its capacity as the title sponsor, JAT has helped in uplifting the standards of the club by aiding in the complete overhaul of the show courts for the event.
Adding another element of interest to the tournament will be a special competition feature called “JAT PowerPoint”. This feature will allow each receiving team to call for a JAT PowerPoint once in each single-set. Upon winning the point, the receiving team would get two points while losing the point the serving team will get only one point. For an example if the receiving team is trailing 15-0, it will directly get to 15-30 by winning the JAT Power Point and lose a point upon losing the Power Point.
Sri Lanka Telecoms’ exclusive TV platform PEO TV has undertaken the task of broadcasting the event live for the fans who will be watching with interest from the comfort of their own homes. Anilana Hotels will be the official hospitality partner supporting the competition.
Asanga Senevirathna, the tennis convener of Queen’s Club stated, “This is a great prospect to bring the whole tennis community together and give our young players and also the fans an exciting opportunity to witness something incredible.
