Teaching the Literature of Mad Women

We narrate our lives in terms of time—how long something lasted, when something began or ended. In doing so, we downplay the importance of place and position—the spaces where things occur, the spaces we are expected to fill, the spaces we are denied. The space of my life changes when I move to the Great Plains, for though Nebraska is wide and open, the margins of my life narrow, the walls of what is considered sane pressing in on me until I see myself as bulky, clumsy, on display. I spend more time in my new home, trapped in solipsistic contemplation of each pain and ache, space becoming so tiny I forget how good using the body can feel, forget the way I used to run or sprawl out. I am too busy trying to disappear.
When you are anxious you are confined to the space illness allows. The occupation is suffocating. Anxiety is compressed, dense, and claustrophobic, a million things packed in a tight mind. And it reduced even further on the Great Plains, the looming expanse pressing down on anxiety’s frantic nature until it reverberates. The first women settlers here went mad: lured by the promise of a lush utopia, they arrived to find isolation, barren earth whipped away by merciless wind.
Tornado eye
In The Bell Jar, Sylvia Plath describes the space of Ester’s depression as “very still and empty, the way the eye of a tornado must feel, moving dully along in the middle of the surrounding hullabaloo.” If depression is the eye of a tornado, anxiety is where the storm tethers down, a fear funneling up and out for miles, growing wild and frenzied overhead.
Several years after I arrive in Nebraska, I teach The Bell Jar in a women’s literature class for college juniors and seniors who are surprised to hear about the history of women’s madness.
“I designed this course around the long-standing notion that women are ‘mad,’” I begin carefully on the first day, worried my students will know I’ve planned the course because I have a personal interest in the subject, have had anxiety several years by now. I continue, “Because a student last semester came to my office to talk about a paper and while doing so told me, ‘All women are a little crazy,’ and I wanted to explore that common misconception.”
“Now, with a decade of teaching and anxiety under my waist-cinching belt, I recognize that I was not angry and afraid because of my madness. It was because of my gender.”
(I don’t say anything more about the student, that his fiancé had recently left him and he called her “that bitch” and “that slut” when he talked with his classmates, or that he wrote war stories with all-male casts and enough explosives to blow up whatever was haunting him from his own military experience, or that he wrote opinion pieces for the university’s newspaper about the danger of feminism and why women shouldn’t be allowed to wear leggings.
I didn’t say that he stretched his legs wide in my office and said he rarely takes classes from women “because they’re all a little crazy.” Or that I chose silence, smiling because I knew what would happen if I did anything else.
Unexpected grade
Resist, talk back and face male anger, incredulity. Couch your opposition and face the same. Give an unexpected grade—a D, a C, a B, the letter doesn’t matter—and be asked to explain yourself. Hear students say, “Everything Is an Argument isn’t a book title—it’s my ex-wife” or “The girls in my group were bossy, that’s why I couldn’t help.” Overhear a student say, “She wishes I raped her.” Have male students shout at you, stand over you and point their fingers in your face, refuse to leave your office until the male professor next door intervenes. Have students write papers defending the multiple rape allegations against their fraternity house or about why the U.S. women’s soccer team shouldn’t be paid as much as the men’s because “women’s muscles, like their brains, are smaller,” or about how women wouldn’t get raped so much if they would date nice guys. Have students write, “I didn’t really care about the course material, but she’s hot” on your course evaluations. The first class you taught? The first assignment? A student wrote a paper detailing why you should date him, then crossed his arms and argued at the back of the class for the rest of the semester when you ignored him. He took a class with you the following semester.
When the student looked me in the eye and said all women were crazy, I felt angry. Then the anger turned to fear. I blamed anxiety for making me too weak to prevent this, for being too afraid to react after it occurred. Anxiety, I’d been told time and again, made me irrational and emotional. It’s all in your head. Now, with a decade of teaching and anxiety under my waist-cinching belt, I recognize that I was not angry and afraid because of my madness. It was because of my gender.)
I watch students that semester—mostly women—applaud writers like Virginia Woolf, whose “Angel in the House” they compare to their mothers and grandmothers and times long before their own.
They are sympathetic to Pecola, the little black girl who descends into madness after being raped by her father and blamed by her town in Toni Morrison’s The Bluest Eye.
They repeat, “Your silence will not protect you,” after Audre Lorde. They ask how they can “Dive Into Wreck” like Adrienne Rich. We read Jennifer Finney Boylan and other trans writers, and when we watch Boys Don’t Cry and they learn Brandon Teena was murdered not far from our Nebraska city, they organize a campus film night.
They tackle complex texts, hold one another accountable. They are kind to themselves and other women.
