Hope for a new autism treatment

Scientists have discovered a defunct gene that affects most autism patients. Known as CPEB4, the gene controls the expression of around 200 other genes that have previously been associated with the condition, a Spanish study found.
The researchers believe CPEB4 may be affected by ‘environmental factors’ that alter a person’s brain development and increase their risk of the spectrum disorder.
Previous findings suggest children may be at a greater risk of autism if their mothers were exposed to certain chemicals or battled an infection during pregnancy. Certain epilepsy drugs and a lack of oxygen at birth are also linked to the condition. The scientists hope their discovery will help in the development of new autism treatments and methods of diagnosis.
More than 695,000 people in the UK are thought to be on the autistic spectrum. The disorder affects around one in 59 children in the US.
Protein changes genes linked to autism
Lead author José Lucas, from the Spanish National Research Council, Madrid, said: ‘Upon studying the changes in protein expression in a mouse model with altered CPEB4 activity, we were surprised to observe that the changes included most of the genes that predispose individuals to autism spectrum disorder.’
Co-author Alberto Parras added: ‘Since CPEB4 is known to regulate numerous genes during embryonic development, this protein emerges as a possible link between environmental factors that alter brain development and the genes that predispose to autism.’
They concluded: ‘Understanding the biological bases of autism may facilitate the design of future experimental treatments and diagnosis tools for this condition. ‘Although further research is required, CPEB4 emerges as a potential new therapeutic target.’
New cancer drugs could halt autism symptoms and prevent their onset
This comes after research released last June suggested drugs under development for cancer could halt autism symptoms by blocking a protein linked to both conditions.
Unnamed medications that stop the protein ERK2 reaching the brain reverse autism-like symptoms in mice, a study found.
When given to pregnant rodents, the drugs not only ease the mothers’ symptoms, such as hyperactivity, but also prevent their offspring from being born with the disorder, the research adds.
Lead author Professor Riccardo Brambilla, from Cardiff University, said: ‘It could be possible, in principle, to permanently reverse the disorder by treating a child as early as possible after birth’.
