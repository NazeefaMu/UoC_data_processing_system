Cast votes responsibly: Rosy Senanayake

Rosy Senanayake, UNP’s mayoral candidate of the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC), requested the public to use their votes responsibly as local government authorities are the most important and closest to the people.
She was addressing the gathering yesterday at the UNP Bala Mandala meeting at Havelock City.
“Local government bodies are the lowest level of the governance, but they provide greater service to the public<” Rosy said.
<U+200B><U+200B>She said the UNP has given equal political opportunities to women.
MP Mujibur Rahman said the UNP would make Colombo great again as it was in Premadasa’s era by winning the upcoming local government elections.
“The UNP always won the CMC, but under the previous governments, CMC did not develop. The power of the local authority was with the UNP, but no effective measures were taken as the Centre had high hand in every matter,” he said.
<U+200B>He said that after R. Premadasa, housing <U+200B>schemes were not implemented and Gotabaya Rajapaksa as the Defence Secretary took over the lands of the people.
Rahman said Colombo children hardly get a chance to enter popular schools and a majority comes out of Colombo. He said he was taking initiatives to change the system.
Chairman of the National Media Centre and Former Cabinet Minister of Media, Postal and Telecommunications Imtiaz Bakeer Markar said the UNP was the only party that could bring all people together irrespective of their religions.
