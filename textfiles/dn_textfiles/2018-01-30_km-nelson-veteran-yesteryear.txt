K.M. Nelson a veteran of yesteryear

I had the privilege of meeting K.M. Nelson, fondly called Nelly, and he indicated to me to address him by his pet name. From the word go, I got the impression that Nelly new his onions about cricket and was not averse to calling “a spade a spade.”
Nelly started with a bang and stated that the “Matara Mauler,” was initially discovered by him playing beach cricket on the scorching sands of Matara. All this originated when Nelly had a drink at the CCC Club with Sanath Jayasuriya’s uncle who was an Assistant Superintendent of the Police Force, then, indicated to Nelly and that Sanath’s mother had got caught to the Tsunami. As a result Nelly was given the task of putting Sanath on the straight and narrow! And what transpired from there is history now.
Nelly was full of praise for late Gamini Dissanayake for obtaining Test status for Sri Lanka in 1981 and specially mentioned that Raja Mahendran was the Vice President at that time. In 1984 the first tour of England by a Sri Lankan cricket team after obtaining Test status took place and Raja Mahendran was the chef de mission. Nelly was fortunate enough to go on that trip, courtesy of Raja Mahendran. This was the tour where Duleep Mendis took Ian Botham to the cleaners, he missed getting twin hundreds by a mere 6 runs. Nelson also stated that he has never seen an innings of such savage power thus far even by surpassing brutal hitters such as Sanath Jayasuriya and the great Aravinda de Silva.
Nelly was a brilliant bowler, bowling off cutters at a brisk pace, at club level and he was the best bowler for five years on the trot. He also represented the country in 1969 when the MCC team led by Mike Denness toured Sri Lanka.
He recalled that Stanley Jayasinghe requested him to bowl to him daily for half an hour and thereafter sat down for a beer and a chit-chat about the happenings in county cricket in England. Clive Inman’s 50 runs in 8 balls came for special praise. Inman was a car salesman in Leicester who unfortunately went on the wrong track, stated Nelly.
He is of the opinion that Sri Lankan strength is their batting and our biggest drawback is the lack of genuine pace in our bowling armory. He stated that Lasith Malinga has seen better days and lacked genuine pace and bowled at military medium pace therefore as a result his time was up.
Nelson’s T20 and ODI squads included the following; Dickwella, Kusal Perera, Danushka Gunathilaka (good fielder) Kusal Mendis (brilliant talent), they must be told to go positive from the word ‘go’ Nelly insisted.
Mathews and Chandimal to steady the ship if early wickets fall, Dasun Shanaka (brilliant timer) and raw talent, and no. 8 Thisara Perera, no. 9 Siriwardene, no. 10 Akila Dhananjaya and no 11 Vandersay.
Nelly was also of the opinion that Dhananjaya de Silva has a lot of class in his batting and he plays in the V and should be persisted with for the future. He also stated that Hathurusingha was an ‘okay’ coach.
When Jayantha Dharmadasa was heading Sri Lankan Cricket, Nelly was offered the chairmanship of selectors but he was gracious enough to refuse that offer because he has not played for the top eleven except once. In his very words he mentioned that he did not want to dilute the quality. He was of the firm opinion that politics should be separated from cricket and there should be a separate Sports Act. Immediate past cricketers should also get involved in the fray, stated Nelson.
Nelly questioned how a person like ‘Gura’ who has been in hibernation for 21 years working for a publishing company overseas, could suddenly be sky dropped into a position with a lot of clout.
He was also of the view that Moody was a very good coach and was on the ball with the boys, Nelly categorically stated that the coaches come and go due to political interference. Nelson was of the view that some of the young talent that we have are behaving like spoilt brats, simply because if they play for two years at national level with a Test match fee of USD-8000/Test and USD 5000/ODI, they can well afford to buy good houses and posh cars. The issue here is how to handle “fame and fortune.” By and large our young bucks are not level headed; swollen heads are the order of the day.
Nelson concluded by stating that Dinesh Chandimal should be the captain of the Sri Lankan team in all three formats. The reason given was that ‘Chandi’ was the more exuberant of the lot and was “fit as a fiddle.”
The highly rated Mathews is unfortunately an “always breakdown case”. The muscle bound Kusal Perera was trying to go pell-mell in our latest ODI against Zimbabwe against a tightly set field, he succumbed to a side strain in the end going for a sharp single. There is something wrong somewhere, as regards to our trainers and physios, just imagine missing out players in the caliber of Mathews and Kusal Perera who are potential match winners on their day, in the mid-stream of a series!
