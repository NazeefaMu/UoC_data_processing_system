Polgahawela flyover complete

The construction work on the Polgahawela flyover in Kurunegala is now complete and it will soon be vested with the public, an official from the Higher Education and Highways Ministry said.
Since the flyover is to be constructed above the railway line, the massive traffic congestion that prevails in Polgahawela will be eased.
The flyover will not only ease the traffic congestion, but also reduce delays on the road, minimizing accidents and lowering the operational cost of vehicles. It will also ensure safe and efficient transportation for the people. He said the Polgahawela town experiences heavy traffic due to the Polgahawela railway station and the town is also the entry point to a number of cities.
The 883 metre-long Polgahawela flyover costing Rs.1.8 billion, will greatly benefit Polgahawela and Kurunagala (A 19) road users.
The project is funded by the Government of Spain and it commenced in April last year.
The Polgahawela Railway Station is located at an important railway junction where a number of trains operate daily to the North, up country and the East.
Around 130 trains travel through the Polgahawela rail junction resulting in long gate closures for approximately 400 minutes per day at the level crossing located along Polgahawela – Kegalle Road (A19) causing a severe traffic congestion.
The project will provide a permanent solution to this situation with the erection of a 883m-long steel flyover which comprises two lane carriageway and two pedestrian ways on either side.
