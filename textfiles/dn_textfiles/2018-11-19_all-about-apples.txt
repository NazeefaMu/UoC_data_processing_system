All about apples!

When we think of French food, images of smooth foie gras, flavorful duck confit, sumptuous cheeses and fluffy cream puffs instantly come to mind.
But apples? A more unexpected association. Convinced of the limitless culinary uses of the forbidden fruit, brothers Daniel and Emmanuel Dayan opened ‘Pomze’ in Paris in November, 2006 in a converted Haussmanian apartment in the eighth arrondissement, where more than 120 apple varieties are worked into their seasonally updated offering. Approximately 600kg of apples are delivered each week to satisfy client demand, proof that the fruit-focused hotspot has garnered a loyal following.
Both the head chef and pastry chef are Japanese and pride themselves on a meticulous attention to detail, presentation and service. In the romantic upstairs dining room, with beige walls lined with black and white photographs of apple orchards, guests discover the range of textures and flavors in everything from draught Cider from Northern Brittany to wasabi marinated salmon with Granny Smith apples and apple crêpes with calvados flambé. Apples elegantly pervade the sophisticated space right down to the freshly baked warm rolls that hint of cinnamon and pack bits of apple in the center.
For those with modest appetites, both the stone cider cellar and ground-floor lounge create a relaxing atmosphere for a post-work apple cocktail with friends. But no experience is complete without perusing the impressive selection of apple-based products, from chutney to apple brandies, in the gourmet shop. One caveat: do not be misled by the seemingly empty entry lounge; all the action happens upstairs.
Abounding in both apples and inventiveness, ‘Pomze’ leaves an indelible impression on even the most discerning of taste buds.
Bon jour Paris
