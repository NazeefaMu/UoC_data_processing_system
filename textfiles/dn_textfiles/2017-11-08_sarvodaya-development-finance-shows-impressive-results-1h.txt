Sarvodaya Development Finance shows impressive results in 1H

Sarvodaya Development Finance, the pioneer in microfinance in Sri Lanka, has shown significant growth based on the 6 months financial results ending September 30, 2017.
The company has recorded a significant growth in terms of net profit after tax in 2017, compared to the corresponding period of the previous financial year. 2017 has marked a year of accomplishment and impactful growth for Sarvodaya Finance, the financial services arm of the Sarvodaya Movement, thrusting the company towards the forefront of Sri Lanka’s microfinance sector.
Commenting on the significant growth achieved by Sarvodaya Finance, Chairman of Sarvodaya Development Finance Limited Channa de Silva underscored that the company has successfully transitioned from a basic micro finance firm to a fully-fledged financial institution, involved in funding leasing, SMEs, personal loans and pawning.
“Going beyond the ordinary banking norms, we have constantly strived to empower people from the grassroots. Our profits are circulated through Sarvodaya Movement to empower rural communities and fund numerous social service programs.
We offer loans for beneficiaries in rural and urban communities for conveniently affordable rates. During calamities such as floods and drought, we have always been in the forefront to support the affected businesses in times of need.
We have also taken steps to empower entrepreneurs, and thereby create jobs that could strengthen and elevate their finances, living standards as well as education. Furthermore, we conduct leadership training programsto empower youth in the rural areas via Sarvodaya Higher Education Institute,” de Silva said.
Expressing his views on the current economic trends, De Silva further added that the time has come for the country to re-examine its approach to the challenges of development with a new mindset.
“Economic policies should be redrafted to strengthen the rupee to at least the 1990’s level, while fiscal and monetary policies should be reviewed to create an environment of low interest rates and low taxes, leading to a backdrop that encourages entrepreneurial activity and employment creation,” De Silva further said.
