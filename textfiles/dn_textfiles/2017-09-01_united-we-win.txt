United we win!

The power of love and vision can be seen in the Drama Club of Maris Stella College where drama is a gift given to the students. Dramatic Moves features the Maris Stella Drama Club which have a reason to be proud for their prowess in drama.
Teacher in Charge of Maris Stella College Drama Club, Nirmala Wijedasa is known as the Mother of Shakespearean drama at Maris Stella. It was she who identified the potential value of the Shakespeare Drama competition. Her vision and love was shared by the school authorities and Maris Stella began their stellar journey
“The students through drama build up self- confidence and I have seen how they are doing so well in their future careers. They have enjoyed and they have gained a lot from doing drama. They have built up their personalities. I am proud to say that the old boy Ashan Dias is acting in the silver screen and is very successful. Daminda Wijeratne is also successful. Daminda Wijeratne comes and helps in Shakespeare competitions in a big way,” said Wijedasa.
Drama is loads of fun but doing practices can be very tiring, practising after school and late night and then coming back to school in the morning. However it is not in vain. The happiness that victory brings cannot be measured in words. For Wijedasa and her young thespians words are inadequate to describe the pleasure they receive when they emerge victorious or even get into the finals. The tension awaiting for results can be nerve racking and nothing is sweeter than being announced the winner.
Wijedasa mentioned that Delon Weerasinghe, is one of the Best Directors they have ever had along with Jerome De Silva. She always gives her fullest support to the Director while overseeing the practices. Then it is only a matter of pulling off a really good production.
“I always speak to my students about dedication, commitment and sacrifice and spur them on! Without that we cannot achieve anything. I always keep on telling them this. I am also a little strict with them as well. One of my duties is to see that they have studied the lines when the director comes. The team spirit is also very important. It is not a one man show because everyone has to be united,” said Wijedasa
Wijedasa always has an ear. She understands that in order for an actor to completely be immersed in his role, he needs to detach himself from any problem. So she is available day or night to talk.
Very complex
President, Maris Stella Drama Club, Sheran Costa feels that the greatness of Shakespeare is that though he lived during the 16th – 17th century, his content is so relevant to real life in the 21st century and will still be relevant in the future.
One Shakespearean character that he mostly relates to is Benedick from ‘Much Ado About Nothing.’ The character details of Benedick are strikingly similar to his own experiences. Hence he does not need to put much of an effort into playing the character since it comes naturally to him. Those who have read the plays of the bard would agree with Sheran that characters like those in Shakespeare’s plays can be seen in real life. This is why Shakespeare is read even today because he is timeless. We see these characters in real life. One would say that this is a trait of all great writers. Even Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen or Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte contain characters that are real life copies. You can see them in society.
“Sometimes I see my father in Shakespearean plays. I see a certain Catherine in Mrs. Nirmala as well! She is strict but nice. I see a Don John (Much ado about nothing) in Reshain,” said Costa.
Costa pointed out that the reason he was able to face our interview was because of Drama. It has definitely molded his diction. We are able to understand what kind of mindset villainous people have. What kind of mindset would a cunning person have? In a way students of drama can predict a person’s reactions.
Costa also pointed out that he has once played Mark Antony. Antony was considered Caesar’s right hand man. After the Ides of March, Antony delivered a powerful speech showing the Romans how great Caesar had been, turning public opinion against Brutus and Cassius. Mark Antony was the kind of person who could influence peoples’ minds through his oratory.
“You need to have a certain tone and a certain amount of passion in your words to make people listen to you. I find it very complex. Once I think about the complexity of the character it kind of scares me. But Mark Antony is a role someone would die for,” said Costa.
One method Costa uses to get into the character is to relate real life incidents into the play. It makes it easier. So you need to study your role first and use every possible resource you can to get into the character. Everyone plays their character in a different way. It requires effort and sacrifice. Once you are in your character and you forget your lines you know what to do next.
“You do something the character would do. If I was Caesar and forget my lines, I think what sort of a thing would Caesar do? It is like improvising,” said Costa.
Costa pointed out that through drama he has gained the all- important skill of diction. He also pointed out that the service rendered to him and his cast by Mrs. Wijedasa is most valuable. She has been a pillar of strength knowing the capabilities of the cast.
Shakespeare is a writer that has impacted the world in an incredible way. Thousands of school going students all over the world is learning from his writings. The Dramatic Moves column features countless students that have been changed by Shakespeare.
Excitement
Secretary, Maris Stella Drama Club, Reshain Perera feels it is the social messages it contains that have turned Shakespeare into something like a cult following
“We learn to understand different decisions from different people. We have transformed from youngsters to seniors,that put us in a position to help the other juniors. Mrs. Nirmala is always watching over us. The directors play their vital role. Our families of course have to be understanding because of late night practices. Drama teaches us decision making, how to enact a role, getting to know people and how to work as a team,” said Perera.
As Costa saw himself in Benedick, Perera sees himself in the character Falstaff that he did in 2014. Maris Stella came third that year all island. Perera says he is able to adapt to that character easily. The fascinating thing about Shakespearean plays is that Shakespeare always writes a play with an example from society. There is a meaning behind every character. Julius Caesar was a real life person. We see a Romeo and Juliet a lot in society. So in Shakespeare there are social messages given to us.
We understand through Macbeth and are able to fully appreciate that there are power hungry people. So we can learn a lot through those characters. Shakespeare’s inspiration is straight from society and real life. Macbeth is a very political play so you can even see certain kind of replay of this tale in not only Sri Lankan politics but in the present day international politics. What Shakespeare has written is timeless. It is very relevant. We can even see a sort of ‘spirit’ of Macbeth not only in Sri Lanka but in the world at large.
Drama gives you a dangerous level of freedom. Imagine what it would be to walk down the road as a Macduff or even as an Othello! How exciting would that be!
“In the future either we should work in a company or start a company. We get the basic foundation from the Drama Club. Getting to know different characters through Shakespeare and doing different dramas, we learn about different characteristics of different characters. From that we derive knowledge and information and through that we develop different skills. To be a female and understand a female as a man, that is an advantage for us when it comes to facing society. That will help us to face challenges and be with people and assist in integration. Of course enacting a female role is very tough,” said Perera
Currently Maris Stella are doing Shakespeare and national drama competitions. Thinking about dramas, they have been doing comedies a lot and are now thinking about giving priority to tragedies. They have the talent so why not? They have proved their mettle by winning the championship three times doing comedies. Since they have the potential it is most likely that we might see Maris Stella win a championship doing a tragedy.
Wijedasa and the boys especially wanted to thank the school for all the support saying they would do anything for the boys to become champions. Wijedasa stressed that Past Principals Rev. Bro. Mervin Perera and Rev. Bro Sunanda Alwis and current Principal Rev. Bro. Chinthana Nonis have been pillars of strength and courage to her.
