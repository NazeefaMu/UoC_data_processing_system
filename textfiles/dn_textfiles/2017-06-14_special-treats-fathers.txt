Special  treats for Fathers

Father’s play a big role in a child’s life. Children look up to their fathers for everything. Sons look at their dad as their perfect idol while the daughters think their dad is the superhero in their life and that no dad is the best expect their dad. Now as we grow up and become parents ourselves, we see the love and protection showered upon us by our fathers.
That’s why June 18 is celebrated as Father’s Day the world over and is given as a day to show Fathers how much we love and appreciate them. Amaya Resorts & Spas has come together to give all fathers a special time off on June 18 with treats and gifts.
 
Amaya Hills: Head up to the hill capital and enjoy a special dinner at Amaya Hills Rasawasala Restaurant.
Dine with your father on June 17 or 18 and choose from a five course set menu or the international buffet.
 
Amaya Beach: Take a trip to our East Coast Beach Haven and treat your dad to a lovely weekend getaway.
 
Amaya Hunas Falls: Take a trip to Hunas Falls and while playing a game of gold at their Gold Pavilion, treat dad to a special High Tea. The spoilt for choice includes Mini Seafood curry puff, crispy fried duck wonton, Leek Bluecheese and olive tarts, steak on mini bagels artichokes & semi-dried tomato and more.
If he craves sweets then he won’t be able to resist the white chocolate & raspberry tart, summer honey & hazelnits steam pudding or the Belgium waffle on white chocolate cheesecake prune salsa.
 
Amaya Lake: Spend a day with us at Amaya Lake and enjoy a welcome drink, lunch buffet and evening tea or coffee.
 
Amaya Langdale: If your dad loves a weekend off in cool atmosphere, then Amaya Langdale is the place for him to go. A special Father’s Day dinner has been prepared just for him.
Choose from appetizers such as handpicked fresh green lettuce & peppered green apple or lemongrass infused spicy seafood Tom Yum from the soups. For mains he can choose a meat, seafood or vegetable dish. For desserts there is the Brandy flamed fresh Nuwara Eliya pear served with Butterscotch sauce and vanilla ice cream.
Show your father how much you have appreciated him every day and this particular Sunday make it extra special with Amaya Resorts & Spas.
