Floating tales from Japan

The term ukiyo-e in the Japanese language is translated into English by Professor Howard Hibbett as ‘floating world’. Professor Hibbett has spent quite some time in many parts of Japan studying the myth, legends, sayings and paintings linked to the country’s folklore with reference to the era known as genroku. This covers the period of the late 17th and early 18th centuries.
As an interested reader, I had the chance of reading some Ukiyo-zoshi tales as rewritten into English by Professor Hibbett in his well-known work titled as The Floating World in Japanese Fiction published as far back as 1959 by the Oxford University Press. Hibbett states that the fiction of the floating world belonged to a prosperous, creative and illegitimate elite. It was the elite of shopkeepers and entertainers at the bottom of the Japanese feudal order.
Wives’ tale
The floating world was known by another term in English as café society. The West has been accustomed to look at the world only in the ukiyo-e woodcuts and not in the Ukiyo-zoshi, its popular fiction. But according to Hibbett, the two are intimately linked. One is called the pictures of the floating world, whereas the other includes tales of the floating world. Two learning creative writers of the floating world are cited as Ejima Kiseki and Ihara Saikaku.
Professor Hibbett introduces the two writers and their works to the English reader. He selects source materials such as Characters of Worldly Young Women by Kiseki and The Woman Who Spent Her Life in Love by Saikaku.
Though regarded by the conventional critics of the later periods as quite trivial and commonplace, Hibbett observes innovation and creative spark in these tales.
For instance, A Wayward Wife has a typically abrupt ending. Kiseki offers a genroku variation on the traditional theme of the spoiled and restless wife. There is also a hint of her indulgent husband, depicted as an innocent human being. The wife had all the pleasures in her life. She led a luxurious life described as living in an incensed room, looked after by many maidservants. Her husband was handsome and urbane. Despite all this good fortune, she disliked being a woman. She was unhappy. One thought obsessed her: Why was I cursed with this sex? I wish to enjoy myself as I please!
What happened next? She sought her husband’s consent to have her hair trimmed in masculine style and wished to dress in a short skirt which looked more like a boyish trouser. Her demands were endless. She wished to travel from one place to another; from one café to another. One day, this couple went to a certain urban tea house.
Hoodwinked husband
Quite a number of episodes emerge. The wife behaves in the café which, alarming enough, brings pains to the husband. But the husband keeps silent as he obeys her orders. But then he realises that the wife has to be allowed to behave in the manner she wants to prolong his life with her. As such, he allows her to do whatever she desires. But since the poor husband has a genius for being hoodwinked, he delights in her conduct saying how original it is to dress up like a man.
There are queer onlookers, who think that the woman has gone off her head. Disregarding the onlookers she even goes on to the extent of dancing and singing. She sings popular songs. The owners of the café too are delighted at her behaviour. An uproarious party lapses into melancholy. Some guests reflect on the evil of squandering money, earned by the sweat of their parents. They feel inclined to go home without waiting for the meals already ordered.
The café’s professional jesters and musicians too become worried. Oblivious of the guests, they share their grievances with each other. Meanwhile, the husband who did not show the real inner sense of the conscience thinks it is fitting to behave as some others do contrary to his behaviour. As such he managed to exchange a few inappropriate household remarks with a courtesan. Followed by the consent shown by her, he pulls out some money from his pocket and momentarily hands over some extra coins to hold her hand and leaves the tea house at once.
Interesting narratives
Perhaps what happened later need not be hinted as the reader (or the listener to the tale) may understand the subtext. In this manner, Professor Hibbett has collected quite a number of tales. These tales, according to him, have later become long narratives. One of the popular sayings in the floating world according to Hibbett, goes as follows: A father slaves, his son idles and the grandson begs.
This proverb, scarcely witty, is indeed a wise one. It seems to anticipate the behaviour of modern children in the floating world, and its truth is still keenly felt. In one of the anecdotes of the floating world, titled as a swaggerer, a shopkeeper’s son follows the ways of the Samurai and gets into trouble. Publicly disowned for the security of the neighbourhood, he suffers misfortunes which are entirely his own fault, known by the term rust from the blade itself. Yet his disobedience is unexpectedly rewarded.
According to Hibbett, the two writers have been engaged in the task of keen listening and patient observation which is a sensitive lesson in the creative process.
