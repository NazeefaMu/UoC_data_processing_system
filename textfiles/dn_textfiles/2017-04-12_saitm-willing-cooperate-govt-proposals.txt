SAITM willing to cooperate on govt proposals

The South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) will abide by the laws of the country and extend its fullest cooperation to the government to formalize a just and expeditious solution for its MBBS students, subject to court proceedings.
This was stated in a release issued by SAITM yesterday. The release adds: “SAITM will also extend its fullest support to the Government’s efforts in maintaining quality and standards in medical education of Sri Lanka.
“SAITM’s mission is to complement the higher education sector of Sri Lanka by providing opportunities to qualified students as per the University Grants Commission and the Ministry of Higher Education regulations and standards. “SAITM medical graduates are trained by a highly qualified panel of academics consisting of 19 professors and over 70 senior lecturers that have served in state medical universities and state hospitals. Further, the Dr. Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital (NFTH) is well equipped with state-of-the-art technology and consists of all relevant units needed for undergraduate medical training.”
