Ravi won’t appear before Commission today

The Treasury Bond Commission issued a notice last week summoning Minister Ravi Karunanayake to testify before the Commission. Minister Karunanayake’s lawyer Sandun Gamage appearing before the Commission yesterday informed that his client is unable to appear before the Commission on July 25, 2017 as summoned.
Gamage said Minister Karunanayake is unable to appear before the Commission due to official commitments he has on the specific day. Gamage further said Minister Karunanayake will inform the Commission a list of days on which he shall be able to appear before the Commission.
