Market to focus on Q3 earnings;  IT, pharma also eyed

Corporate earnings from major players like HCL Tech and L&T is set to be announced in the coming week; BSE is set to come up with it IPO from January 23. It is looking to raise over Rs 1,200 crore.
Corporate earnings, Budget expectations and global events may keep market volatile in the upcoming week. It is a truncated week as Indian market will remain shut on Republic Day holiday on January 26.
The Supreme Court will be hearing a petition on January 23 which will seek the postponement of the Union Budget due to the scheduled Assembly polls in five states. Any change in the Budget day may induce more volatility or even weakness in the market. In the week ended January 20, Indian investors remained cautious in tandem with global markets.
IT and pharma stocks saw selling pressure on Trump's views on visa issuances as well as drug pricing. Banking stocks too faced pressure on increase in asset quality concerns in the quarterly earnings. The Sensex ended lower by 274 points while the Nifty ended below 8350 as banks and IT stocks dragged the indices. Global markets last week witnessed volatile movements as investors were wary of key events such as US President Donald Trump's policy stance and Britain's exit roadmap from the European Union. European markets too remained choppy, sending the pound lower, as British PM Theresa May in a speech outlined her plan for a ‘clear’ exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union (EU).
The European Central Bank (ECB) left its key rates and bond buying programme unchanged and hinted that the stimulus package may increase if necessary. Here are the key events to watch out for next week. Corporate earnings Among the key earnings to watch out for will be the likes of FMCG major Hindustan Unilever (HUL). A CNBC-TV18 poll estimates the company's profit to fall 0.5 percent in December quarter to Rs 967 crore, while the total income may fall 4 percent to Rs 7,450 crore.
Among other major companies announcing Q3 results will be HCL Technologies, Larsen and Toubro and L&T Finance. BSE IPO The initial public offering (IPO) of leading exchange BSE will hit the floor on January 23 and close on January 25. A first by the exchange, the bourse aims to raise Rs 1,243 crore and has fixed a price band of Rs 805-806 per share. The IPO of 15,427,197 shares of face value of Rs 2 each will constitute up to 28.26 per cent of the fully-diluted post offer issued share capital of BSE, it said in a public notice. Bank stress to continue? Banking stocks may continue to see selling as stress continues.
A quick scan of few lenders’ Q3 earnings indicate how managing asset is still a concern for them. Last week, Axis Bank lost nearly 5 percent on asset concerns. However, analysts are betting on the stock albeit concerns on its loan growth, fee income pressures and failure of any improvement on slippages.
IT and pharma on radar Shares of information technology (IT) and pharma companies will be in focus as they will watch out for Trump's policy stance on visa issuances as well as over-pricing of drugs. Stocks from both the sectors had ended lower last week over these developments. Trump has maintained his stand on restricting the issue of H1-B visas, a development that will hit IT companies hard. In a press conference earlier this month, he had hit out at drug companies for overcharging of drug prices and stated that the companies were “getting away with murder”. BBC
