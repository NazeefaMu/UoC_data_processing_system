Hamilton aims to emulate Federer and Djokovic

In battle for F1 title:
Lewis Hamilton wants to emulate the tennis players he admires – Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic – by delivering consistent results in his attempt to win the Formula One world championship after his intense battle with Sebastian Vettel to win the Canadian Grand Prix. The British driver, who now trails Vettel by 12 points, said that their relationship remained one that was respectful but with a hard, competitive edge.
Always a happy hunting ground for Hamilton, the Canadian Grand Prix was once again conquered by the British driver but his skill was rewarded to a much greater extent than merely claiming his sixth win at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve. While Hamilton led from pole to flag in a race in which he never relinquished control and followed the Mercedes team’s plan to perfection, his Formula One world championship rival Sebastian Vettel endured a trying afternoon from which he did well to manage a strong comeback. But it remained a major blow, the German’s fourth-place finish cutting his 25-point advantage over Hamilton to 12.
“What I loved about the race with Sebastian is I love tennis and I love watching Federer and Djokovic in the final and what I really admire is consistency,” he said. “I admire their concentration and how they are so awesome and stay at the limit. I felt I had that battle on Sunday.”
Hamilton believes it is an approach he needs to take to the season as a whole. “For me it is about consistency,” he said. “You can get ahead for one race and be behind in the next. It is about trying to perform as I have this weekend at every single race we have left. That is what I am thinking about. It doesn’t matter if I am leading the championship after the next race what matters is if I am leading the championship after the last race.
His comments reflect how seriously he takes the fight with Vettel and that he expects it to be maintained throughout the season.
“I love a tough fight and I love a challenge. He was respectful and still that respect stayed the same at the end. We are never going to be happy finishing second. If he finished second and was happy, I would be concerned.”
