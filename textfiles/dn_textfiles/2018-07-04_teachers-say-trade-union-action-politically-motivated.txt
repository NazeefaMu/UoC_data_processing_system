Teachers say trade union action is politically-motivated

No one can violate the fundamental rights of students by refraining from educational activities, since students have the right to receive an education, several educationists pointed out with reference to the call for trade union action by some educationists.
Thousands of teachers and principals are expected to report for duty today as usual. Most teachers and principals stressed that they will report for duty, despite a narrow-sighted trade union action calling to boycott duty. They said they do not want to be a cat’s paw of politically-motivated trade unions, which act on a hidden political agenda.
Responding to some media reports that trade union action is scheduled to take place today against the decision taken by the Education Ministry to promote several education officials, allegedly on the basis of political revenge, many teachers said, according to their knowledge, the teachers are to be promoted after an impartial and transparent procedure.
Speaking to the Daily News, most moderate teachers pointed out that they are duty-bound to educate students and not hamper their education.
“If there are issues to be rectified, unions should choose better ways rather than hampering the education system. Moreover, trade union action to boycott duty is a violation of the fundamental rights of students,” a female teacher, who serves in a leading school in Colombo, said.
Another male teacher in the Mawanella Education Zone, who requested for anonymity, said many teachers, including the principal, will report for duty today as they don’t want to adhere to politically-motivated trade unions.
Meanwhile, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam urged not to sabotage the country’s education system by politicizing it. Refuting some media reports, which claimed that all government schools will be closed today due to trade union action, Minister Kariyawasam confirmed that schools will not be closed today and education activities will be carried out as usual.
“All promotions have been done through a proper legal procedure by a committee and only 1,011 officials have been selected from 12,000 applications,” said the minister.
