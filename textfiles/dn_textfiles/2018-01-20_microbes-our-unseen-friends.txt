Microbes, our unseen friends

Microbes are tiny little creatures that are not visible to the naked eye. They should be observed with the help of a microscope. Microorganisms can belong to different categories. They are bacteria, fungi, protozoa, algae and viruses.
Microorganisms are the natural decomposers. These decomposers include bacteria, fungi and actinomycetes. They are the creatures who degrade the complicated organic substances into simple inorganic substances, releasing energy and nutrients, hence, facilitating plants to uptake the nutrients and involve in nutrient recycling in the environment.
Certain steps in the biogeochemical cycle such as Nitrogen cycle, Sulphur cycle and Carbon cycle involve several types of microorganisms. Some examples are Rhizobium involving in nitrogen fixation. Nitrosomonas involve in the nitrification process. Thiobacillus and Green Sulphur bacteria involve in Sulphur oxidation process and etc. In the Carbon cycle, microbes mainly act as decomposers, helping to decompose dead plant and animal material.
Their next important activity is the Bioleaching. It is the process described as the dissolution of metals from their mineral sources by certain naturally occurring microorganisms or the use of microorganisms to transform elements so that the elements can be extracted from the original sample. Fe and Cu are such two metals that are extracted from bioleaching procedure. If we take the use of chemical and physical methods, a lot of gases and harmful chemical substances will be released into the environment, causing environmental pollution. However, by using the microorganisms and providing suitable conditions to them, we are able to leach out the element we need without causing many environmental impacts. The exposure of economically important plants to various pests and insect attacks is a critical problem faced in the field of agriculture. When engaging in mass cultivation, there will be a lot of economic disadvantages. So to stop those attacks, there is the use of insecticides. But one of the major problems when using these chemicals is that the insects create a resistance within them by exposure to such chemicals. So to overcome this problem, now we use bioinsecticides.
These bioinsecticides contain live bacteria that produce toxins which cause stomach poison in the insect and kill them. But those are not poisonous to the plants. And also to supply nutrients to the plants, the microorganisms are taken. These are named as biofertilizers. They produce essential nutrients like nitrogen, sulphur, phosphate over chemical fertilizers because chemicals decrease the quality of soil and create health issues in humans as well as animals. So the use of biocontrol agents and biofertilizers which are composed of microorganisms is a more effective technique to be used in agriculture.
Another use of microorganisms is to treat the wastewater. Secondary treatment microorganisms are added and they are allowed to grow. They use the organic matter and decompose them so that degraded compounds are deposited. Then the water can be separated from the deposited matter.
Bioremediation is another important process when talking about microorganisms. Remediate means to solve a problem and bioremediation means use biological organisms to solve an environmental problem such as contaminated soil or groundwater. Contaminants treated using bioremediation include oil and other petroleum products. If we see how it works, some types of microbes are capable of eating and digesting those contaminants. They usually change those contaminants into a small amount of water and gases such as carbon dioxide, hence cleaning the environment from pollution. The bioremediation relies on microbes that live naturally in soil and groundwater. And they create no threat to humans. So the bioremediation process is a much safer process to make use of to clean contaminants from the environment.
The field of medicine also incorporates the use of microorganisms a lot. The vaccines we use for various diseases are made of microbes that are dead or inactivated so that they are unable to cause the disease. The antigen in the vaccine is the same as the antigen on the surface of the disease-causing organism. The vaccine stimulates the body to produce antibodies against the antigen in the vaccine. When the vaccinated person comes into contact with the disease-causing microbe, the immune system remembers the antibodies and makes them faster. So the person is protected against that microorganism. And also certain antibiotics such as penicillin, tetracycline, streptomycin are extracted from microorganisms. These antibiotics either help to prevent microbe cell wall synthesis or protein synthesis hence protecting the person against infections.
Also, microbes are used in the field of recombinant technology to make various proteins. Human growth hormone and insulin are two such hormones produced using recombinant microorganisms.
Some microorganisms keep us healthy. Those microorganisms are in large numbers inside our body and they stop the development of disease-causing organisms. One example is our gut microbial population. And now there are commercially available products named as probiotics. These are the supplements made of beneficial friendly lactic acid bacteria formulated to reflect the composition of healthy gut microorganisms. These help to increased tolerance to infections, control diarrhea and etc.
Microorganisms are also used in the field of food and beverages such as wine industry, the beer industry, edible microorganisms and etc. For the production of wine grapes, the grape pulp is kept for fermentation. The yeast used for the fermentation grow a film on the fruit or in the environment. And also some cultivated strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are added in order to improve the quality of our wine products.
Beer is also an alcoholic beverage made from the fermentation of starch sources such as rice. The process includes the microorganisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces uvarum. Brandy and whiskey are some other beverages produced from the fermentation activity of microorganisms. Fermented milk and dairy products also make the use of microbial activity. This fermentation is done by the lactic acid bacteria. Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Streptococcus are some lactic acid bacterial groups. Lactic acid bacteria ferments the carbohydrates such as lactose in milk into lactic acid. Because of this lactic acid, proteins are precipitated and it gives a thicker consistency to our dairy product. Microbes are also taken as food supplements such as single-celled proteins. These are dried cells of microorganisms such as algae, bacteria and fungi. Spirulina is one such example of those food supplements.
Microorganisms are tiny organisms. So apart from above mentioned activities they may possess many more uses. It is true that certain types cause diseases. But we can not neglect microbes as disease-causing organisms because without them much of ecosystem and human activities will be interrupted. So we cannot consider them only as our enemies.
