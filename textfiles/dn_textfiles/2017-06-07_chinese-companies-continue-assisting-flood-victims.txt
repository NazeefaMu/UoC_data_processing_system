Chinese companies continue assisting flood victims

The Colombo Port City Company and the Chinese-owned Zhongtian Construction Group have delivered relief items to families affected by the major floods and landslides which hit Sri Lanka earlier this week.
Representatives from the two companies, on Friday, visited the Pahiyangala village in southern Sri Lanka and handed over relief items to officials from the Disaster Management Center and the Army.
Villagers thanked the two companies for their prompt assistance, at the Yatagampitiya Primary School, which presently shelters some of the affected families. The Colombo Port City Company donated 6,200 cups of instant noodles while the Zhongtian Construction Group donated 10 beds, 20 bags of concrete, 40 metres of cloth, 100 boxes of drinking water, 30 boxes of biscuits, 24 boxes of instant noodles, five disinfectant sprays and some toys for the children.
Pahiyangala Disaster Management Relief Service Officer U.H.R Upul Kumara said, he was extremely grateful for the assistance rendered by the Chinese government and the Chinese companies, as relief supplies were still needed for the affected people. Pahiyangala, housing around 700 families, is one of the worst affected villages when severe rains and strong winds caused devastating floods and landslides since May 26.
