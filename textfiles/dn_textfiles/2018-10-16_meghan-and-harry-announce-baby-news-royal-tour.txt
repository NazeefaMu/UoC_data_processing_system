Meghan and Harry announce baby news on Royal Tour

AUSTRALIA: Meghan Markle has announced she is pregnant.
The Duchess of Sussex had sparked speculation that she was expecting after landing in Australia carrying two purple folders.
It will be her first child with husband Prince Harry. Meghan and Harry arrived into a rainy Sydney for the start of a 16-day visit to Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand.
The trip, their first outside the UK and Ireland, will officially will see the couple watch the Invictus Games, visit a Sydney zoo and visit the rural Flying Doctor service.
The couple were driven from the airport to Admiralty House, the Sydney residence of Governor General Peter Cosgrove, the representative of the Queen in the country.
Hundreds of people gathered to catch a glimpse of the couple and cheered as their car was driven into the property a short distance from the iconic Sydney Harbour Bridge.
The 76 engagements also include visits to schools, greeting members of the public at the Sydney Opera House, and meeting young leaders and community members at Government House.
After Australia, the couple will fly to Fiji, where they will be greeted with an arrival ceremony similar to one attended by the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh in 1953.
In Fiji, Harry will pay tribute to Fijian war veterans and the couple will attend a state dinner, before flying to Tonga.
The tour will conclude with a four-day trip to New Zealand, where they will be greeted by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.
The Duke and Duchess will learn about environmental challenges while in Wellington, visit a charity which supports children with parents in prison, and meet members of the public in Auckland and Rotura.
Harry and Meghan will return to London from Auckland on November 1.
The Duke and Duchess of Sussex made a low-key arrival to a wet and wintery Australia after a weekend spent celebrating the marriage of their relative Princess Eugenie and following an overnight commercial flight with Qantas.
They were seen leaving the airport with staff, looking relaxed, as Meghan clutched a pair of purple binders and Harry carried a brown and green manbag.
Queen Elizabeth II is still the head of state in Australia although there is significant support for the country becoming a republic.
Recent polls show Australians fairly evenly split on the issue, with only the slimmest of majorities in favour of ditching the British Queen and nominating an Australian head of state.
After sailing Sydney Harbour and visiting the famous Bondi Beach, meeting flying doctors, attending functions at the Invictus Games and meeting Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, they jet off to Fiji on October 23.
Meghan will get a chance to speak at a UN women’s empowerment in marketplaces event and meet some female vendors in the project in the Fiji capital Suva. - MIRROR, AFP
