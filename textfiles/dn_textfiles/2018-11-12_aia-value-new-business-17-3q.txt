AIA Value of New Business up 17% for 3Q

AIA Group Limited has recorded a 17 per cent growth in value of new business (VONB) on constant exchange rates (CER) for the third quarter ended September 30, 2018.
Ng Keng Hooi, AIA’s Group Chief Executive and President said, “AIA delivered a strong performance in the third quarter with 17 per cent growth in value of new business to US$979 million. Today’s results and our consistent track record of growth are the direct outcome of the quality of AIA’s exceptional businesses and our disciplined approach to delivering our strategic objectives.
“The needs and expectations of Asian consumers are changing rapidly. Personal health, wellness and the need for financial protection are increasingly front of mind. Combined with rising affluence, this will drive increasing demand for our protection and long-term savings products across our markets.
“The powerful combination of AIA’s competitive advantages in distribution and product innovation, empowered by our increasing use of technology, places us in an exceptional position to help meet these rapidly-evolving needs. Our brand promise to help millions of people to live healthier, longer, better lives provides a strong basis for developing deep, long-term relationships with our customers and differentiates AIA. I remain confident that our teams will continue to focus on delivering high-quality growth and generating long-term returns for our shareholders.”
