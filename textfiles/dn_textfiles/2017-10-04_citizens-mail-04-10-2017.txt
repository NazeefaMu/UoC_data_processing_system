[CITIZENS' Mail - (04-10-2017)]

Bus burden
While I was in Colombo for a fortnight on state service (GCE A/L marking and evaluation) I had to travel by bus between Modera and D S Senanayeka College, Borella. Unfortunately, I had to take three buses to reach my destination. The worst part of travelling around Colombo is the peak hours between 7.30 and 9 in the morning, and 4.30 and 7.30 in the evening. The congested traffic jams remains a stumbling block to attend to urgent matters. The Alluthmawatha road leading to Hettitiyawatta had been blocked for days because of some pipeline construction. The commuters had to use Bloemendhal road as an alternative.
Usually, the private bus conductors are hell-bent on gathering passengers despite whatever the difficulties they would face eventually. The buses on the route between Mattakkuliya and Colombo Fort brim with passengers. This applies to most other buses during the rush hour. The passengers – older people, infants and children in particular - are compelled to suffocate without proper ventilation. Some commuters choose the footboards with both driver and conductor ignoring it. They would suddenly urge the passengers inside if they happen to spot traffic police officers.
The Traffic Police, on the other hand, do not strictly enforce law and order even though the public break it in the broad daylight. When a passenger gets down, they are forced to squeeze themselves through the crowds. Although the bus is short of space, the conductor would still force the passengers to go further inside.
The conductors move back and forth, shoving the people inadvertently, to collect the ticket fare. As a remedy, passengers should be allowed to use one entrance to get on and the other is to get off. At the same time, the conductor can get the bus fare easily without troubling and making the situation awkward.
The bus journey, honestly speaking, is inconvenient and molestation to the female commuters. Buses keep on increasing, but there is no smooth, stress-free happy journey on a metropolitan city like Colombo. Sadly, this is the travelling routine in Colombo.
The transport authority should not only be keen on generating money but should be concerned about the comfort and health of the people as well.
