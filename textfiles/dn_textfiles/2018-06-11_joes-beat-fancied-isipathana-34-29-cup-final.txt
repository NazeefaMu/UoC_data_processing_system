Joes beat fancied Isipathana 34-29 in Cup final

St. Joseph's College Maradana wing three quarter Keshan Kavinda touched down for a try in the dying stages of the game where they came from behind (27-29) to beat the fancied Isipathana College outfit by 34 points (4 tries, 4 conversions, 2 penalties) to 29 (4 tries, 3 conversions, 1 penalty) in their Singer 'A' Division inter-schools league rugby second round Cup Championship final match played at Havelock Park in Colombo yesterday. At half time the score read 20-17 in favour of S. Joseph College Maradana. With this win Joes were crowned the 2018 Cup Champion runners up on points, pushing St. Peter's to the third place.
Both teams dished out a superb game displaying running rugby through out the game but the small-made Isipathana College outfit was the pick of the lot and had an outstanding game with both in attack and defence.
Pathana staged a spirited performance in the second half scoring two back to back tries. But it was too late for them to turn tables on the Josephians who sealed their victory.
Victorious S.Joseph's College scored their four tries through winger K.D.Kavinda (two), Gamunu Chethiya (one), co-winger cum last years Dharmaraja College player Dulanjana Piyatissa (one) while fly half Santhush Algama put over all four conversions as well as the two penalties for the winners.
For the losing Isipathana College team their centre Manula Rathnayake (two), K.Kaushalya and flanker Janith Serasinghe scored the three tries, while captain Manelka Ruberu slotted in the three conversions and the solitary penalty.
Referee - Dinka Peiris had a very poor game with the whistle
