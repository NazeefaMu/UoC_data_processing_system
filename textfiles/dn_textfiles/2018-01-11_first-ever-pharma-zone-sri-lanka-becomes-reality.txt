First ever Pharma Zone in Sri Lanka becomes a reality

“Local pharmaceutical manufacturers will now be facilitated with sufficient land and basic infrastructure facilities for manufacturing plants to produce pharmaceutical products locally, with a view to achieving the government’s target of localizing production of essential pharma items to a value of 100 million US dollars”, said the Health Minister Dr Rajitha Senaratne.
He said this at a special event held at the Water’s Edge on January 8, in which the State Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Corporation (SPMC) entered into an agreement with Pharma Zone (Pvt) Ltd, to build the first ever exclusive pharmaceutical manufacturing zone of Sri Lanka in Kalutara district with an investment of over 10 million US dollars.
The facility that encompasses 50 acres of land is a BOI project and its principals are Sultan Ibrahim, Sultan of Johor and Patrick Lim, a leading Malaysian entrepreneur.
The minister commented, “We have reduced prices of drugs in the marketplace. A particular drug prescribed for high blood pressure that cost Rs. 2,900 per a packet is now available at Rs. 280. Similarly a pill for diabetes that was Rs. 215 earlier is now sold at Rs. 17.60. Panadol was reduced from Rs. 3 to 1.30/-. We have thus reduced prices of 48 pharmaceutical brands that include 402 drugs”.
The minister said all these measures are taken in accordance with Prof Senaka Bibile’s recommendations on a national pharmaceutical policy.
SPMC Chairman Dr Sayura Samarasundara said that with the completion of the Pharma Zone, envisaged to be in operation within one year, the Country’s dependency on imported drugs will soon become a thing of the past. The Zone will be run and administered by Pharma Zone, headed by Patrick Lim, while SPMC along with the health ministry will set standards and monitor quality.
The Zone will be run and administered by Pharma Zone, headed by Mr Patrick Lim Soo Kit, while the SPMC along with the Ministry of Health will set the standards and monitor quality.
Electricity, water, road infrastructure, security, waste water management, will all be provided to the companies operating within the Zone, and it is the intention of Pharma Zone to attract overseas investors to set up operations within the Zone as well. “We will be marketing Pharma Zone regionally,” said Lim.
