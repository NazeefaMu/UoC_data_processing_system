Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales’ Teaser Trailer

Prepare yourselves, ‘Pirates of the Caribbean’ fans…the first trailer for the fifth movie has finally arrived! A teaser for ‘Dead Men Tell No Tales’ aired during ‘Fear The Walking Dead,’ and it was definitely worth the wait. Watch the epic first video right here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xo3af_6_Jk)!
We don’t see Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp, duh) or Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) in this trailer, there’s plenty of foreshadowing of what’s to come for the fifth film’s main characters. The new villain in Dead Men Tell No Tales is Captain Salazar, played by Javier Bardem, and in the almost 2-minute teaser clip we see the ghostly antagonist tell newcomer Henry (Brenton Thwaites) that death is upon Jack. Okay, can you say INTENSE?!
This first look has been a long time coming for Pirates fans, as it’s been six years since the fourth installment, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, hit theaters. Those who loved the original cast from the first film have also been eager for this next movie because Orlando Bloom will be reprising his famous role as Will Turner for the first time since 2007’s Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End. Now that we at least have a glimpse at how awesome the fifth movie will be, the excitement just got even bigger!
The story will revolve around a downtrodden Jack Sparrow and his nemesis, who escaped imprisonment in the Devil’s Triangle and, with the help of his ghostly crew, is now looking to destroy any pirate in his path — which includes Jack. To avoid being completely eradicated, Jack must find the Trident of Poseidon to give him the power to control the seas. As the captain of the Flying Dutchman, Will joins Jack on his quest, making for one classic Pirates film!
Other than the synopsis, we weren’t really given any indication about how things will end up for Jack in the latest Pirates installment. While it’s still not fully clear from the first look at Dead Men Tell No Tales (other than the fact that he’s inevitably going to have to try escaping death), it does seem like this will have the same spirit of The Curse of the Black Pearl that made these movies such a phenomenon. If anything, it looks like one heck of a thrill ride! HollywoodLife
