Enchanting 'Ella'

 
Do fairies, wicked witches, ogres, tree monsters, dungeons and dragons really dwell in this world or in the universe for that matter? Do giants really roam on clouds as told in fairytales? Are fairytales mere works of imagination or do they shed light on an unknown past and an unpredictable future?
