‘President wants to increase forest cover’

President Maithripala Sirisena wants to increase the percentage of the forest cover in Sri Lanka which is only seven percent of the total lands of the country, Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S.B. Dissanayake said.
Addressing the media at his ministry at Sethsiripaya, Battaramulla on Wednesday, he said Sri Lanka is a country that protects the environment.
According to Minister Dissanayake, President Sirisena gazetted four lands adjoining Wilpaththu National Park to make sure that the park is protected while ensuring that the people who had been chased away from their villages during the war are resettled in the same lands where they lived before the war.
The minister said no religious place will be removed or destroyed. President Sirisena ensured the ownership of people’s ancestral lands and invited them to resettle in them, he said.
