Rejection of nomination list, SLFP seeks SC remedy

Six members of Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) have filed a Fundamental Rights petition in the Supreme Court seeking an Interim Order restraining the Election Commission from taking further steps under the provisions of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance to proceed with holding the election to the Dehiattakandiya Pradeshiya Sabha.
They are seeking an order in the nature of writ of Mandamus directing the Returning Officer appointed for the Maharagama Urban Council to accept the nomination paper delivered to the Election Officer by the authorised agent of the SLPP for the election of members to the Maharagama Urban Council.
The nomination papers handed by the SLFP were rejected for the reason that they have been handed over by a person who is not the authorized agent or the secretary of the party and the required number of female candidates were not named in the same.
This petition was filed through counsel Sanjeewa Kaluarachchi.
The petitioners had cited Assistant Commissioner of Elections (Ampara District), SLFP General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake, UNP General Secretary Kabir Hasheem and JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva as respondents.
