Marvelous metro stations in the world

Under-ground metro stations are associated with rats, garbage, noise and filth, not architecture. However, there are a few metro stations in the world that go against the grain, standing out as excellent examples of the beautiful architecture and interiors that can be created in underground spaces.
The interiors achieved in some of these metro stations become all the more impressive when you consider the challenges unique to creating comfortable underground spaces. The architects must keep track of the structural integrity of the walls, air circulation, excessive moisture, and a million other concerns. Their maintenance is another difficulty entirely – one that transit organizations often have difficulty with.
