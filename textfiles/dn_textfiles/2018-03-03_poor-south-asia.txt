The poor in South Asia

South Asia with 22 percent of the world population and 1.3 percent of the world’s income has 60 percent of the world’s poor. Thus, the majority of the poor lives in South Asia.
However, only those below the income level of US $ 2 per day have been counted as poor. It fails to recognize several other factors that equally define poverty. The $2 limit is an arbitrary number which does not take into account the peculiarities in each individual country and the level of development reached by countries.
For poverty is a relative concept. There is absolute poverty and relative poverty. Though there is no absolute poverty populations could be poor in comparison with the well-to-do. Poverty alleviation cannot be reduced to an increase in monetary income alone. It could also hide causes of poverty.
In most Third World countries poverty is an inherited trait. It is a factor of underdevelopment, often due to colonial plunder of their resources. However, there could also be new forms of poverty, viz., those connected with development. Such are those evicted from their traditional settlements due to development projects. Similarly natural disasters such as droughts and floods could also throw hundreds into poverty.
It has also been shown that the lack of an equitable distribution of a nation’s resources is also a contributory factor to poverty. Reduction of inequity in distribution makes a greater impact on poverty alleviation than simple reduction of the gap between the rich and the poor. For when the poor increases their income, the income of the rich increases much faster. This has led to the widening of the rich-poor gap and an increase in the ratio of one to the other.
Poverty alleviation needs much more than income support. There should be a holistic approach, which necessarily include the development of physical and social infrastructure. Of special importance is skills development or human resources development.
Structural defects in the economies that have marginalized entire communities due to historic factors also contribute to the perpetuation of poverty and they require special efforts for their elimination.
South Africa to affect radical land reform
South African Parliament has passed a resolution to amend Section 25 of the Constitution to enable the government to carry out a radical land reform that would end racial disparities in land ownership which persist more than two decades after the end of apartheid.
The resolution passed by an overwhelming majority of 241 votes to 83 votes against was brought forward by Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party, and was approved after an amendment proposed by the ruling African National Congress (ANC) was incorporated.
Two weeks ago South Africa's new President Cyril Ramaphosa said he would speed up the transfer of land from white to black owners. However, he stressed it must be conducted in a manner which preserved food production and security.
“I will shortly initiate a dialogue with key stakeholders,” he said, adding: “There is no need for any one of us to panic and start beating war drums.
“We are going to address this and make sure that we come up with resolutions that resolve this once and for all. This original sin that was committed when our country was colonized must be resolved in a way that will take South Africa forward.”
Border dispute threatens Brexit deal
British Prime Minister Theresa May has rejected a proposal by the European Union to establish a “common regulatory area” between Brussels and Northern Ireland.
She said: “The draft legal text the Commission has published would, if implemented, undermine the UK common market and threaten the constitutional integrity of the UK by creating a customs and regulatory border down the Irish Sea, and no UK prime minister could ever agree to it.”
The EU proposal outlined by the bloc's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, states a “common regulatory area” between the EU and Northern Ireland would be established in the event an EU-UK agreement on a future relationship fails to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland.
The EU document further said: “”The common regulatory area shall constitute an area without internal borders in which the free movement of goods is ensured and North-South cooperation protected in accordance with this Chapter. … The territory of Northern Ireland, excluding the territorial waters of the United Kingdom…shall be considered to be part of the customs territory of the Union.”
In response to the British refusal to accept a “common regulatory area” EU Chief Negotiator Barnier called on Britain to provide “better ideas” on how to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, “while preserving the integrity of the single market”.
