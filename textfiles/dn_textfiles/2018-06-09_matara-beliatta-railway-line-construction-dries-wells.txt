Matara-Beliatta railway line construction dries up wells

Wells at Palavinna, Dedduwawala and Beliatta have dried up due to the construction of the Matara-Beliatta railway line.
Residents complain that they undergo acute water shortage since the pipe-borne water being provided to them is inadequate.
They said they brought the issue to the notice of the authorities, but so far they have not been given any solution.
Beliatta Divisional Secretary Kanchana Thalpawila said the residents ask for tube wells but it takes sometime to get the cost for such a project.
