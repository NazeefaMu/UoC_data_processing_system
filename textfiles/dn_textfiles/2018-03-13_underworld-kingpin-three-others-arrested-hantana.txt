Underworld kingpin, three others arrested in Hantana

A four member armed gang was arrested at a hotel in Hantana by a special Police team from Colombo on the day of the Kandy unrest on March 9. Police said a notorious underworld kingpin was among the four suspects arrested. Police said they raided the hotel on information that a criminal gang which had arrived in Kandy was hiding in the area.
Investigations are on to ascertain the reason for their presence in Kandy on the very day of the Kandy unrest.
