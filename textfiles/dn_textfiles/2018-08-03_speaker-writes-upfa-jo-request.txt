Speaker writes to UPFA on JO request

The Speaker’s Office had reportedly informed UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera to submit the party’s official position regarding the request made by a group of UPFA MPs to appoint MP Dinesh Gunawardene as the Opposition Leader. A letter has been sent to Minister Amaraweera by the Speaker’s Office yesterday.
A group UPFA MPs who have identified as Joint Opposition members had sent a letter to the Speaker requesting him to appoint UPFA MP Dinesh Gunawardene as the opposition leader.
They had cited that their group numbering 70 MPs in Parliament is the majority in Opposition and they deserve the post of Opposition Leader.
