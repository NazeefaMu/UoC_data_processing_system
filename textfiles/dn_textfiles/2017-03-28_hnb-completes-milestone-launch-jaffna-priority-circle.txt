HNB completes milestone launch of Jaffna Priority Circle

HNB announced the launch of its popular Priority Circle plan at its Jaffna branch.
Enabling a new paradigm in retail banking, Priority Circle is a breakthrough service from HNB that delivers a host of valuable benefits to members including access to attractive interest rates on deposits and advances, free internet and mobile banking facilities, and a comprehensive range of Wealth and Legal advisory services.
Members of Jaffna’s civil society including Bishop Rev. Dr. Daniel Thiagarajah, Church of South India, Pastor Sam Rajasooriyar, Director, Humedica International and, Dr. T. Sathyamoorthy, Director, Jaffna Teaching Hospital were present at the opening.
“The launch of our Jaffna Priority Circle is truly a milestone event, both for HNB and for the Northern region as well. This represents the very first time that any Sri Lankan bank has been able to offer such exclusive services to high net-worth clients in this region. We have invested a lot of time and effort to craft a set of value additions that are sharply focused on matching the discerning expectations of our customers.
“HNB Priority Circle is, by far, the best proposition in the country and we have worked hard to bring together a comprehensive range of services all under one roof. HNB Priority Circle represents an unprecedented opportunity to enjoy the very best banking service experience in Sri Lanka and we warmly invite all of our customers to experience and enjoy this heightened level of convenience for themselves,” Perera said.
