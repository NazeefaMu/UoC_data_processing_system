Navy rescues four Indian fishermen

A Fast Attack Craft attached to the Northern Naval Command rescued four Indian fishermen drowning in the northern seas in the early hours yesterday, the Navy Media Unit said .
The Fast Attack Craft, while on routine patrol in the northern seas had spotted the ill-fated Indian trawler, which was fast sinking, and the four drowning fishermen 8.5 nautical miles west of Analaitivu island.
Responding swiftly, the SLN personnel had saved the Indian fishermen from drowning by taking them on board in time. They were safely brought to the naval base at Kankesanthurai, having provided medical aid as well as food and drinking water since they were found to be exhausted from their struggle to stay alive.
"SLN divers attached to the Northern Naval Command are engaged in salvaging the sinking Indian fishing trawler. Discussions are also underway with the officials of the Indian High Commission in Sri Lanka to repatriate the rescued Indian fishermen," Navy Media Unit sources added.
