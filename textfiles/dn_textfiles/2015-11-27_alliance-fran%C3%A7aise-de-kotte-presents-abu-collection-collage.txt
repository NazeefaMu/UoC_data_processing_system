Alliance Française de Kotte presents : ABU Collection of Collage

The Alliance Française de Kotte à Colombo presented the 'ABU Collection of Collage' by Prasad Abu Bakr at its gallery at 11, Keppetipola Mawatha, Colombo 05 (adjoining Police Park). Sponsored by Pegasus Reef Hotel, the exhibition is open to the public till Sunday November 29 from 10am to 6pm daily.
Chief Guest at the invitees-only opening on November 19 was Pegasus Reef Hotel General Manager Harsha Jayasinghe while the Guest of Honour was General Delegate of the Alliance Francaise Foundation in Sri Lanka Claude Alexandre Martinez.
In this exhibition, Abu the artist combined his two favourite techniques to compose pictures creating unusual collage compositions. An amateur photographer himself but having a long artistic career to his credit, Abu has formed a collection of artworks combining photography with painting and pasting of 'bits n pieces' of paper torn off from magazines, creating a visual impact of rare visual beauty.
His involvement with the arts began as a self-taught artist until he came under the direction of late Cora Abraham (pioneer of the present Cora Abraham Art Classes - once also known as Melbourne Art Classes) where his creative instincts were brought out and sharpened, not by rigid drawing or painting techniques but mostly through her attitude towards children and their response and attitude towards creativity in their evolving life. "It was an excellent kick-start for me at a tender age, which I cherish up to date", says Abu.
Abu has used his creative instincts to nourish other fields in the arts such as batiks, interior decorating, fashion designing, creative crafts, photography and literature. However he used his talent in painting to enhance most of the above artistic exercises he got involved in all along.
His involvement in batiks began when he started work with late Vipula Dharmawardena as an artist for wall hangings. He later joined Ena De Silva, the lady and her designer outfit responsible for creating the three gigantic Lanka Oberoi lobby pennants' hanging over head at the Atrium Lobby from the late 70s until recent times. Under her direction however Abu was trained to design for batik garments where his first ever exposure was designing for ladies wear and involving himself in fashion shows organised by one of Colombo's leading boutiques 'Mariposa'.
Abu's exposure overseas sharpened his knowledge in the creative arts and gave him the opportunity to work as an interior designer for leading hotel groups here and travel overseas as a pavilion designer at leading travel fairs where Sri Lanka was taking part promoting tourism.
The Alliance Française de KOTTE is fully affiliated to the Fondation Alliance Française in Paris and enjoys the total patronage of the Government of France and the Embassy of France in Sri Lanka.
