Attack on artistes : PC member refuses court settlement

Wayamba Provincial Council Member Don Kamal Indika, who allegedly attacked several artists on a stage of a political rally during the last Presidential Election with three others, did not agree to reach a court settlement when the case was taken before the Kurunegala Chief Magistrate N. Hewawasam on Last Tuesday.
The incident occurred during the last Presidential election on December 29, 2014. The three suspects, PC member Don Kamal Indika, Hemakumara and Nishanta Kumara, allegedly attacked the artists at Ibbbagamuwa, Kumbukgaha Junction.
The Defence Lawyer told court that the complainants were willing to reach a settlement except PC member Kamal Indika because of his political background.
The judge put off the case to May 15.
