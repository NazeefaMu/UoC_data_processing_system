Sampath Bank holds workshop   to help young inventors go green

Sampath Bank, one of the nation’s most innovative banks, in their continuing bid to secure a sustainable future recently held a workshop for the “Sampath Green Inventor” competition finalists at the Buddhist Cultural Centre.
The 78 finalists were shortlisted from 17 state and private universities for the final round to present their inventions which are designed to help environmental conservation.
The workshop itself aimed to groom the young inventors in the principles of “product development and socially responsible entrepreneurship” that form the basis of the competition.
The workshop was also attended by the eminent panel of judges as well as prominent figures involved in environmental conservatism to guide the finalists on their journey.The inventors were provided with an understanding on the necessity and the positive impact of developing green inventions.
“Our impact on the environment is a very important question that must be addressed.
As we begin to come to terms with how we have been treating the world around us it falls on the inventors, the dreamers, the innovators to envision a path to a greener future. We are dedicated to provide these inventors with the necessary tools and platform needed to help create viable solutions to ultimately reduce the harm we are doing the environment thereby creating a sustainable world for future generations,” said Lalith Weragoda, Assistant General Manager Human Resources, Sampath Bank.
The primary focus of this competition is to encourage young inventors in Sri Lankan universities to provide sustainable solutions for environmental protection and conservation with green innovations.
Established in 1987 Sampath Bank has become a state-of-the-art financial institution that continues to be a market leader today thanks to their constant innovation and customer focused approach to business.
Workshop in progress.
