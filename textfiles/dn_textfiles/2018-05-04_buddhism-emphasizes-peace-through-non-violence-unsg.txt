Buddhism emphasizes peace through non-violence - UNSG

United Nations Secretary General (UNSG), António Guterres speaking during the annual commemoration of Vesak at the United Nations Headquarters in New York on May 01, noted that although born a prince, Buddha rose above self-interest and went into the world to help overcome human suffering. “His teachings are based on the principle that compassion is central to enlightenment, and as such, his message of service to others is more relevant than ever,” the Secretary-General said.
The United Nations Day of Vesak was celebrated in New York on May 01, in accordance with UN General Assembly resolution 54/115 recognizing the Day of Vesak internationally as the most significant day for Buddhists all over the world. The Permanent Mission of Sri Lanka to the United Nations in New York, along with the Permanent Mission of Thailand took the lead in organizing this years’ commemoration, together with other states that co-sponsored the resolution in 2000.
The celebrations commenced on the morning of May 01, with a dana offered to over forty Buddhist monks representing Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, and the Republic of Korea, at the Sri Lanka Mission premises. Sri Lanka’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations Ambassador Dr. Rohan Perera and senior diplomats from Thailand, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Laos, Bhutan, Nepal and Republic of Korea attended the ceremony and offered dana to the Maha Sangha. A number of lay persons, including the staff of the Missions of these countries were also present. Chief Incumbent of the Staten Island Buddhist Vihara in New York, Ven. Heenbunne Kondanna Thera conducted the religious ceremony.
A solemn event to mark the Day of Vesak, co-chaired by Ambassador Dr. Rohan Perera and Permanent Representative of the Kingdom of Thailand to the United Nations, Ambassador Vitvihas Srivihok was held in the evening of May 01, from 6.30 to 8.30 p.m. at the United Nations General Assembly hall. A large number of Buddhist monks representing many countries, President of the General Assembly Miroslav Lajcák, UN Secretary-General António Guterres, Permanent Representatives of Member States, senior diplomats, senior UN officials, staff of the Permanent Missions and the UN Secretariat, and communities from various countries attended this solemn event.
Ambassador Rohan Perera delivered the opening remarks, highlighting the significance and relevance of the message of Buddha in addressing contemporary problems that affect the world today. Dr. Perera noted that, despite our best efforts, we are confronted with unprecedented challenges in the global order. In identifying the root causes of these conflicts, Ambassador Perera referred to the Buddha’s teaching which states that “wrong views” are the reasons behind the challenges we face, and in order to tame these views, underlined the need to adopt “Samma Ditti” or right views within ourselves.
The President of the General Assembly (PGA) in his brief statement highlighted three principles from the teachings of the Buddha, which are sources of guidance to the activities of the United Nations; firstly, “the middle way”, secondly metta (friendship) and karuna (kindness), and lastly the fundamental equality of people. He further noted that these same values are enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. Lajcák concluded by saying that while the United Nations was not born of any religion, these timeless principles remain important to its work and that they “shine a light on the path to peace – peace among nations, and peace within people.
Secretary-General of the United Nations, António Guterres paid reverence to the birth, enlightenment and parinirvana of the Buddha and emphasized the inspiration found in his message of service in order to become global citizens. Secretary - General Guterres stated that the Buddhist world view teaches us to see ourselves as a part of this world and not its masters, and Buddhism’s “emphasis on non-violence stands as a powerful call for peace.” He concluded by referring to the focus in Buddhism on the inherent dignity of life, which finds resonance today in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
Following the remarks by the President of the General Assembly and the UN Secretary – General, the five precepts were chanted by the maha sangha of the Theravadha tradition and blessings were invoked by the venerable monks of the Mahayana tradition.
A sermon was delivered by scholar monk, Bhante Henepola Gunaratana Thera, who is the founding abbot of the Bhavana Society, West Virginia and Chief Sangha Nayaka Thera for North America. In his sermon, Ven. Gunaratana said that the Buddha identified the global problem of humanity as “universal suffering”, with the root causes of this suffering being greed, hatred and conflict within ourselves. He called upon all to practice Metta to rid themselves of these feelings, and said that the teachings of the Buddha can only be found in the hearts and minds of the people.
The sermon was followed by a devotional song, ‘Himi Sanaramara’, performed by Visharadha Shalika Aroshini.
Representatives of Bhutan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Norway, Russia, Singapore, and Vietnam, among others, addressed the General Assembly reflecting on the significance of the Day of Vesak.
The event was followed by a Dansala or distribution of alms in the lobby of the General Assembly Hall to all those who were in attendance.
