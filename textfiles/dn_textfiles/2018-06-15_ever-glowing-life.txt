Ever glowing life

Juliet Coombe discovers a heavenly solution to wellness in the heart of Colombo city and feels inner calm after a two and a half hour ever glow experience that puts the sparkle back into her life
Leaving the noise and smells of Colombo 7 behind I take the Jetwing Colombo 7 lift at Ward Place to the second floor, where I enter into an oasis of tranquillity and wonderful smells of cinnamon and spices.
The atmosphere of the Frangipani SPA is such that I feel completely at ease as I fill out my health form and wait with some excitement for my series of treatments from head to all over body massage. The iced flannel that is brought is an absolute lifesaver after the blistering heat of the Sri Lankan hot sun. The Frangipani SPA is like a little sanctuary, an oasis away from the extreme weather changes from torrential rain to humid hot sun for travellers, over worked business people and stressed out mums to just treat themselves to an experience that will reboot even the weariest person. “It is all about taking a quiet moment out of ones busy life to put the ever glow back into your lifestyle both on the inside and the outside” explains Samantha the highly experienced therapist who clearly loves her job.
I was wrapped in a crisp white towel and this was the beginning of the idyllic experience as I was then treated with special oils that suited my skin type, which were soothing, cool, and empowering without being overbearingly strong in smell. I learn the word ‘massage’ comes from the Arabic ‘massa’ meaning ‘to touch, feel or handle’ and that in 700 BC, Bian Que, the earliest known Chinese physician, used massage in medical practise to release stress. Touch is vital in all our lives as it stimulates the release of endorphins (the body’s natural pain killers) and there are approximately five million touch receptors in our skin-3000 in each fingertip alone and that a 60-minute massage is about the same as 7-8 hours sleep to your body.
The ever glow experience started with a head massage, which was an amazing re-boot mixture for the hair of egg, olive oil and avocado oil. “Different skin” explains my therapist working in the mixture so my hair would glow again “requires different oils and this is created for dry hair from too much sun shine which damages the hair so it breaks at the end”. The head massage pressure was strong and used pressure points to help the herbs to absorb and makes the hair have a youthful glow with vibrancy one only sees at fashion shows.
The next part of the experience was a facial and Samantha mixed different herbs again as in my case she said, “your skin is a combination skin and so I have used a cleanser of tomato juice, one lime drop, aloe vera and pure bee honey.” Aloe Vera face massage and the pack to take out the impurities of the skin and dirt required a milk rice heated fermentation with herbs to warm up the skin and make it youthful by removing all the dead skin, which in turn brings an outer glow in process. After this was fermentation was gently moved around the face, a pack with turmeric, oats and curd be placed on my face for twenty minutes. During this time my shoulders were worked on and I was asked to pick between the salt scrub, which detoxes the whole body or the herbs red with the ancient beauty treatment of white sandalwood. I went with the second option, as it is great for re-conditioning the skin and body polishing. After this all over scrub I was told it was best to take a cold shower with only water no soap as that remove all the good work of the herbal infusions and use only the herbal conditioner on the hair as many conditioners strip the goodness further out of the hair and do not really help re-build it beyond the surface level.
After showering moisturiser was put on to re-build my skins ph- balance and the herbal moisturising cream with aloe Vera smelt so good I fell into a deep sleep, as Samantha found the pressure points of my feet to help clear all the internal organs of toxins. She moved from feet to upper body and finally the neck area to release me of the stress of carrying too much camera equipment around for my job.
On finishing this wonderful experience she offered me a delicious ginger tea and explained that it is important to try to do this every two weeks, and this is the secret to a healthy long life with an ever glow in your face. Many people who are about to get married come for the seven day bridal packages with her, which includes yoga and many secret treatments that will make the entire body glow on that special day. So go on treat yourself to an ever glow experience that will re-energise even the most burnt out person. Ask for Samantha De Silva the main therapist at the Jetwing Colombo 7 SPA as she has over 12 years experience in these treatments, including working in India in Kerala and a passion for the wellness programmes that is infectious.
As I sip my ginger tea Samantha explains “I love sending people away healthy with their energy fully recharged.” Showing me a mirror she said “you are glowing with a very relaxed look in your eyes,” and sure enough my skin was vibrant all over and the twinkle youthful look was unmistakable. It also explained the timeless beauty of the hotel’s General Manager, Rookamanie Fernando, who is a pioneer in getting all of us to get our work, life balance right. Rookamanie as past of her wellness mission has introduced a ‘Recharge Sunday’ experience at Jetwing Colombo 7 to encourage people with a sample one hour SPA treatment to make this part of their weekly routine. It also includes early morning yoga, a healthy breakfast, and a chance to feel on top of the world again while enjoying the pool that gives one a bird’s eye view of Colombo.
