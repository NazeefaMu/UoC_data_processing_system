Only ‘political strays’ advocate new political party - SP Chief Minister

Those who advocate the idea of establishing a new political party are a group of political strays with no voter base in their respective electoral regions. They have no perception of the necessary work for the advancement of the masses.
“They work for an opportunistic agenda of their own benefit. Hence I urge my beloved party cadres not to follow them,” Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal said.
He was addressing a gathering following the inauguration of the new Kosgahawella - Ilukmulla Electricity Supply project in the Ambalangoda electorate recently.
"I have never before made a political statement of this nature. I think seriously before making any political decision. I have not been mistaken in any of my past political decisions past as I always waited for sound political judgment - for the sake of my party and my supporters. As such I trust that my current political stance is also proper and precise,” the Chief Minister further said.
“I had quite lengthy political relationship with President Maithripala Sirisena. During those days I kept constant connections with him. However since he took the new political turn to be the common candidate at the previous Presidential election, I stopped all such connections. At the previous election I did my best for the victory of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa for he was the leader of our party. Thereafter he was defeated and consequently the new President was offered for the party leadership. Now the leader of Sri Lanka Freedom Party is President Sirisena. He is a loyal SLFP member. I accept and obey the leadership of President Sirisena. So I strive to serve my party men to the best of my capacity under the leadership of Maithripala Sirisena,” Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal said.
Recalling the past he said that those who tried to establish new parties all ended in political disaster and had to rejoin the same party they left.
"I joined the Sri Lanka Freedom Party 24 years ago. The late Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike appointed me as the SLFP Chief Organizer for Ambalnagoda electorate. Thereafter Former Presidents Chandrika Bandaranaike and Mahinda Rajapaksa became the party leaders respectively. Under all of them I worked for the people and the party loyally and faithfully to the best of my ability."
"As a Sri Lanka Freedom Party member I cannot go against the party leadership. I am not prepared to follow those who are campaigning against the party and its leadership. I am a passionate follower of the vision and the mission of the party. So I sincerely request those troubled about the situation to logically and rationally make the right decision, and not to allow a division within the party," he urged.
