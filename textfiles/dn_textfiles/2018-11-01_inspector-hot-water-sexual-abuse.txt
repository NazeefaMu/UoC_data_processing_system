Anuradhapura Police Child and Women’s Affairs Bureau Officials arrested the Deputy Officer-in-charge of Dodangoda Police for sexually abusing an underage schoolboy by taking him to Anuradhapura from Kalutara.
On receipt of a complaint made to Kalutara South Police by the parents of the schoolboy, the inquiry had been transferred to Anuradhapura Police by Kalutara North Police as the sexual offence was committed by the Inspector at a holiday rest room in Anuradhapura on the third week of October. Police said the Inspector was produced before Anuradhapura Chief Magistrate Janaka Prasanna Samaratunga by the Child and Women’s Affairs Bureau of Anuradhapura Police.
