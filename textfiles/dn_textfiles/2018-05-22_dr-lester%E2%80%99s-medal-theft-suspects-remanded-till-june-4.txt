The six suspects arrested for stealing the Golden Peacock medal awarded to the late Dr. Lester James Peries at the International Film Festival of India in 1965 were yesterday remanded till June 4 by Colombo Additional Magistrate Priyantha Liyanage.
Bambalapitiya Police informed Court that the bus driver and conductor who noticed the medal on the overhead rack of their bus and brought it to police, identified the first suspect at the identification parade held yesterday.
Police had found an expensive mobile phone as well that the suspects had stolen from the veteran film director’s house.
Police told Court that 5th suspect had bought the stolen mobile phone from the suspects.
The counsel appearing for the 5th suspect informed the Magistrate that his client had no connection with the theft. The defence counsel pleaded bail for the 5th and 6th suspects.
The Magistrate ordered to release the 5th suspect on personal surety of Rs. 500,000 and refused to grant bail for the 6th suspect.
Police stated that the group was in the habit of stealing valuable items from crowded places.
The Magistrate refused to grant bail for other five suspects and fixed the hearing for June 4. The stolen medal during the funeral of the late Dr. Lester James Peries’ residence was found from a 177 Kaduwela–Kollupitiya private bus on May 5.
Dr. Lester James Peiris received the medal along with the Golden Peacock Award for the best feature film for his film ‘Gamperaliya’ at the third New Delhi film festival in 1965.
This was the first time a Sinhala film won an international award.
