‘DOCTORS NOT QUALIFIED TO SPEAK ON FTAs, GMOA BATTING FOR RAJAPAKSA’

The GMOA’s resistance to the Singapore-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement is no different to its previous canard that RAW spies would come to Sri Lanka with the 1990 Suwaseriya ambulance service, Mahaweli Development and Environment Deputy Minister Ajith Mannapperuma said.
The Deputy Minister addressing a press conference at the Sirikotha UNP Headquarters yesterday said the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) has no subject knowledge to speak on the FTA with Singapore.
He accused the GMOA of undertaking a contract of pro-Mahinda Rajapaksa group towards toppling the Government by deliberately spreading falsehood and involving in a fear mongering campaign.
The GMOA announced an island wide strike on August 3 in protest of the FTA with Singapore.
“The doctors did not strike when substandard drugs were imported to the country or when the hospitals lacked essential facilities such as beds. They did not strike when the Senaka Bibile Drug Policy was delayed for decades, but they strike over the FTA with Singapore which is completely irrelevant to them,” he said. Mannapperuma stressed that the doctors should not interfere into the decisions that should be taken by the economic specialists. “What they are speaking is outside their orbit.The MBBS degree does not confer knowledge that economic experts have,” he added.
The Deputy Minister called on the GMOA to concentrate on the issues related to their profession without undertaking political contracts to appease former President Rajapaksa.
“The GMOA previously objected to the ‘1990’ Suwaseriya ambulance service and led a misinformation campaign against it.
Today Suwaseriya service is highly admired by all the people. It is highly problematic as to why the so called educated individuals lead misinformation campaigns in this manner. It is not that they don’t know the truth. They do it knowingly to fulfill the political aspirations of another group. Not all the doctors approve the GMOA stance. It is a mafia,” he said.
Mannapperuma said the Government’s aim with the FTA is to bring in more foreign exchange into the country, adding that duties have been waived for 80 percent of the goods coming from Singapore as per the FTA. “The FTA with Singapore will mark a turning point in the country’s economy. We have the space to amend the agreement in another year’s time and rectify any identified shortcomings,” he noted.
The Deputy Minister, commenting on the sluggish pace of legal action against the perpetrators of corruption, said only five persons have been convicted for the offense of corruption for the last 25 years in Sri Lanka.
“Our law is lenient as such. We need to make our law strong that not only the little fish but also the big fish can be nabbed effectively,” he commented.
