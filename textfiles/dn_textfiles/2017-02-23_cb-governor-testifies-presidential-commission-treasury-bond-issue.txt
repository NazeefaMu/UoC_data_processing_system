CB Governor testifies before Presidential Commission on Treasury Bond issue

Central Bank Governor Dr.Indrajit Coomaraswamy answered in the affirmative when asked whether the bids accepted at the Treasury Bond auctions were not in line with the amounts stated in the notice on February 27, 2015 and March 29, 2016.
The CBSL Governor was in agreement with the views expressed by Justice Prasanna Jayawardane.
The CBSL Governor was testifying before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into the Issuance of Treasury Bonds for the second day of the proceedings.
Justice Prasanna Jayawardane made the conclusion following a question he forwarded to the CBSL Governor regarding the Treasury Bond auctions held during Coomaraswamy’s tenure.
“During your tenure were the bids accepted at the Treasury Bond auctions been approximately in the line with the amounts stated in the notice?” Justice Jayawardane questioned.
“Yes, I think the Monetary Board took a decision that the amount offered would not be exceeded. The broad policy decision of the Monetary Board was that the amount offered should not be exceeded,” the CBSL Governor replied.
Then, Justice Prasanna Jayawardane directed CBSL Governor’s attention to the time before his tenure where the bond issue at hand took place.
“Going back to the time before your tenure, I think it is correct for me to say that the only instance in which the bids which were many time more than the amount stated in the notice were accepted on February 27, 2015. Is that conclusion of mine correct?” Justice Prasanna Jayawardane questioned, to which CBSL Governor replied that to his understanding it indeed
was the case.
Apart from the two aforesaid instances, generally the bids have been in line with the amounts stated in the notice, Justice Prasanna Jayawardane also pointed out.
Senior State Counsel Shaheeda Barrie who led the evidence also questioned the CBSL Governor whether the Central Bank generally accepts bids significantly more than it advertised.
President Counsel Nihal Fernando later appearing on behalf of the Perpetual Treasuries Limited pointed out to the Presidential Commission that during the mandate period there had been many instances where much higher amounts of offers have been accepted.
PC Fernando made the remarks based on a sheet to be authored, as he told to the Presidential Commission,by his client.
The commission later requested Fernando to furnish the dates on which such amounts of offers have been accepted.
Fernando failed to provide the Presidential Commission an authenticated document including the requested details at that point of time.
The Commission directed PC Fernando to provide substantial information if possible in the future.
