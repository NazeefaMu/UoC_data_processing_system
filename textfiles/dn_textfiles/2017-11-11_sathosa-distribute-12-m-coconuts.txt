Sathosa to distribute 1.2 m coconuts

The Lanka Sathosa has taken steps to distribute about 1.2 million fresh coconuts among consumers through its sales outlets countrywide at Rs. 65 per coconut.
The coconuts would be provided by Kurunegala Plantations, Chilaw Plantations, the National Livestock Board and Elkaduwa Plantations attached to the government.
“Since there is an acute shortage of fresh coconuts in the market at present, President Maithripala Sirisena has informed the Cabinet to explore all possibilities to assist low income people,” Lanka Sathosa Chairman Dr. T. M. K. B. Tennakoon told the Daily News.
