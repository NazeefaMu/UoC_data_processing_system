BCC makes representations on Budget 2018

The Business Chamber of Commerce (BCC), which was founded 2000, issued a statement with its observations and proposals on the National Budget 2018 together with selective comments on the state of the economy.
BCC is pleased that despite numerous setbacks the country has had to face during 2016, it has been able to achieve a GNP growth rate of over 4.5% last year.
In fact, according to Census Department, the country did achieve a slightly improved growth rate during the second quarter of 2017, but the question that looms large is why the state revenue which is a part of the GNP had in more recent years shown a downward trend.
In contrast, the revenue generated was around 10% of GNP in and around the 1990s. Above this, three decades ago it reached a high point of 20%.
However, we note that between 2014 and 2016 it did increase by 3-4%.
It is important for the state to investigate and establish the reasons as to why the revenue targets are not met. This surely is an important exercise when considering that the government is repeatedly confronted with the task of increasing revenue in order to meet spiraling domestic expenditure especially by way of providing an array of services to the public besides meeting the continuously rising wages bill and other connected payments to over 1.3 million state functionaries throughout the island.
It is in this context the government has introduced a new Inland Revenue Act. But before venturing into commenting on the new Act, we intend to examine other aspects of economic development that will help the country to reach new heights of growth. At this stage of our representations, we wish to comment on exports which is of primary importance to the nation. Exports are key to more favourable balance of payments. At the present time, the economy is faced with not only a heavy imbalance of trade but also with a formidable debt burden which are unfortunately recurrent features in current times.
In order to have a proper assessment on exports, we need to examine the export performance of the country in 2016 and 2017. In 2016, there was a contraction in exports, in respect of both agricultural and industrial exports. But during the first half of 2017, the situation showed an improvement in regard to both groups of exports.
Industrial exports increased by 13% and main agricultural products - especially tea has shown a welcome upward trend (17.8%)
On the other hand, though the increases are not excessively high they are encouraging in spite of the fact international marketing conditions were not buoyant.
In any case, there is an obvious and vital need to bring about a vast improvement to the export picture as against the need to curb runaway expenditure on imports.
It is an oft-repeated truism that recurrent imbalances, whether they be favourable or unfavorable are bad especially the latter. If you look at the global picture of international trade, favourable balance of large trading nations continuously distorts global trading patterns. Two examples of nations whose favourable balances are considered harmful are China and Germany.
These countries over the years have had favourable balances of trade and their adverse impact on their principal trading partners has been severe.
The United States is one nation that is highly critical of this situation and has threatened to raise tariff barriers in order to curb excessive imports. This has raised the spectre of protectionism or economic nationalism. It will be also harmful to smaller trading nations like Sri Lanka.
Our export strategy needs to undergo radical change. The key words in this connection are product and market diversification besides value addition and innovation.
From a macro perspective how could Sri Lanka achieve these goals? We could of course gain inspiration from a few nations which provide the right environment and conditions besides coordination between institutions in the public and private sectors.
Both Vietnam and Bangaladesh are apparently well ahead of us in export generation. The latter is diversifying its product base by going into areas like pharmaceutical production. They are fast emulating the new pharmaceutical hubs in Asia - India and Pakistan. It is necessary to mention a vital economic input in this connection which is considered a priority by progressive nations namely competitiveness. In theory, competitiveness like trade bestows prosperity on the people. The GDP remains the best barometer to judge competitiveness. Also the rate of GDP growth in terms of PPP or purchasing power parity is a sound means of evaluating the progress of a nation and whether it is moving in the right direction. BCC would like to propose the establishment of councils on competitiveness in relevant areas of both the public and private sectors in the tradition of other progressive countries.
Sri Lanka has yet to gain ground in respect of value addition. However, a few companies in the field of tea exports have achieved some success through the introduction of new varieties of tea in the export markets. One example is iced tea in bottles which are gaining ground in retail outlets and becoming popular as a beverage in European markets.
Similarly, Sri Lanka is successful in the use of raw rubber to produce vehicle tyres and tubes but the progress achieved by individual exporters do not constitute a national endeavour.
Constant innovation and research on market development should take precedence in the nation's export effort. Research and development and a tie up between the private sector and research institutions in the public sector should be a vital aspect of export development. Sri Lanka though a mixed economy for ages is increasingly dependent on the private sector to generate more economic activity. In this context, it is important that the two sectors should closely work with each other so as to achieve better coordination in private sector operations.
Importantly, companies cannot work in isolation. We wish to refer to bilateral trade tie-ups with two of our large neighbours – India and Pakistan. Sri Lanka has experienced a number of non-tariff barriers which have forestalled exports in particular to India,
Though such non-tariff barriers have been discussed frequently at different fora, no positive results have been achieved. It is necessary that the state officials should take this issue up with their counterparts in India at the highest levels. It is equally necessary for the state sector to realize that the private sector cannot operate in a vacuum. A frequent refrain of the business community is that quite apart from supporting enterprises, the bureaucracy through a host of procedures inhibit the private sector. There are many examples to cite.
One such example is the sugar manufacturing project with foreign collaboration in which the local party who is a member of our chamber is involved. The project has not yet been implemented due to red tape and inordinate delays.
The second is a proposal submitted by another member of the chamber to utilize abandoned and idle tea estates owned by the government in the Matale district. The idea was to plant spices on a large scale for which Matale is ideal.
This is on account of the fact that that the demand for spices in overseas markets is favourable but the supply is inadequate.
Sri Lanka is indeed fortunate that the European Union has restored GSP Plus which was deprived to the country for five years. This is to the credit of the present government which launched a sustained campaign to regain GSP plus.
Presently the EU offers Sri Lanka duty free concessions to as many as 1,400 export items. This creates ideal conditions to this country that needs further exploration of the EU markets
A mini boom in exports to the EU was observed despite the loss of duty free access.
During the period GSP Plus was not available to Sri Lanka, some local exports did exceptionally well in the EU market. This is encouraging.
During the period under reference when GSP Plus was unavailable, our total exports declined to 13% from 90% of the main 10 items. Among the items worst hit were apparels and garments which were reduced to 5% and fish and diamond exports by 65% and 93% respectively.
Somewhat surprisingly, coconut oil exports saw phenomenal increase by 3,500%. Essential oils and herbal extracts by 138%, fruit and vegetable by 71% and processed food by 10%. Electronics exports also achieved a major breakthrough in the EU market when their exports increased by 40%. Coconut fibre, leather goods, tobacco and toys also fared well in that market.
All these achievements were reflective of the dynamism and enterprise of the newly emergent export community who achieved this over a five-year period during which period GSP Plus was not available to Sri Lanka.
A proactive overseas trade commissioner/overseas representative service should be based in different continents and tasked with the responsibility of identifying markets and investment opportunities in their respective stations. It is vital that they should be
highly communicative and oriented towards transmitting information to Sri Lanka constantly.
The two state agencies - Department of Commerce and Export Development Board - have a renewed role to play in trade promotion if Sri Lanka is to achieve the declared goal of being an export hub.
We earlier mentioned that a new Inland Revenue Act will be effective from April 2018.
This chamber’s concern in this regard rests largely on corporate activity especially,
(a) exports, (b) domestic investment, (c) foreign direct investment and (d) taxation including duties, revenue collection and compliance.
The new Act is balanced and more equitable to the middle class whereas it taxes the rich in a bigger way. It thus benefits the broader segment of society.
But we would like to add a note of caution that capital formation and savings together with a reasonable tax and duty regime are factors that contribute to economic growth. True enough that debenture issues launched in the course of this year are indicative of a favorable climate in financial entities like banks. A cursory examination will show that most buyers of such debentures were the corporate sector and not the public at large. This defeats the intentions of the government to create a class of share-owning people in the country.
We are pleased that the introduction of the capital gains tax is likely to bring black money into the tax system in particular, through hitherto undeclared sources of income.
The introduction of enhanced penalties should indeed be made effective and be pursued without fear or favour. It will enlarge the tax net and enable those who try to avoid payment of tax which in the past had been an unfortunate feature in this country. Exporters are of the view that 0.5% service charge acts as a disincentive to export generation. This is particularly in the context of rising domestic costs associated with export production. It also adds to the rising shipping and logistical costs.
We urge the government to remove the economic service charge.
