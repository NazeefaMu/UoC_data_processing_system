Rajya Sabha MP recommends MR be awarded Bharat Ratna

Rajya Sabha MP of the Indian Parliament and senior politician Subramanian Swamy in one of his latest tweets has cited that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa deserves the ‘Bharat Ratna’ just as Nelson Mandela was, for saving Sri Lankans and Indians from LTTE terrorism.
“Not as a guest of Bharat Mata. MR is a cultured person. But just as we have awarded Bharat Ratna to Mandela for freeing his people we should award MR for freeing his people and Bharatiyas from LTTE terror,” his tweet read.
The MP also defended the Chinese presence in Sri Lanka saying that Indians should learn to befriend the Chinese as they had been friends since ancient time without any military incidents.
