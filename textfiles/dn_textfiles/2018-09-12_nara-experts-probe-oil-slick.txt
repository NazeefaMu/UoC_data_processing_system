NARA experts probe oil slick

The National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA) commenced an investigation on the environmental effects of the oil leakage that occurred recently in a pipeline from tankers to a storage facility in Uswetakeiyawa.
A team of experts attached to NARA are carrying out the investigation which will continue for three months, a NARA source said.
A pipe in the buoy began to leak spilling oil into the sea when crude oil was being unloaded from a ship last Saturday.
Security forces and the Coast Guard along with other agencies took immediate action to contain the spill. Experts on marine protection too were deployed to assess and minimise any possible damage to the environment and marine life.
