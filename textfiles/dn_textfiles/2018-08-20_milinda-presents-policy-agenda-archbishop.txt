Milinda presents policy agenda to Archbishop

Milinda Moragoda together with Urumayake Ulpatha Chairman Lalith Weeratunge presented a copy of the policy agenda, ‘Fresh Thinking for a New Generation - An Agenda’ to the Archbishop of Colombo Cardinal Malcom Ranjith recently.
Milinda presented the Agenda to many spiritual leaders and opinion-makers in the country in the recent past.
The Agenda was originally drawn up to develop a non-partisan national policy agenda for the country to stimulate public discourse and debate.
The preliminary version of the document was released in October 2017. Over the last 9 months, Milinda Moragoda together with his Urumayake Ulpatha Foundation have been incorporating citizens’s ideas into the document.
