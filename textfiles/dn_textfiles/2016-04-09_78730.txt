Politicians should be cautious about how to use power: President

All politicians should be cautious about how to use the power vested with them as leaders or members of a political party by the people in a democratic, free country and they should also know the place they are entitled to in that context, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
The President also emphasised the power given by the people should not be used by politicians to strengthen their own family and political power.
He made these remarks participating in the 100th birth anniversary celebrations of Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike at the BMICH Thursday.
President Sirisena said Sirimavo Bandaranaike never used the power vested with her in an inappropriate way and she was totally against fraud and corruption as well as her personal qualities like patience, commitment, honesty and the strengthen to face the challenges were exemplary to all in the field of politics today.
He said it is a timely need to emulate those qualities.
The greatest service by Sirimavo Bandaranaike to the country was a timely need in that era and those decisions were important at the international level too, the President said, adding that he had seen tears in the eyes of Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike in some situations in which challenges were faced by the country or her political party.
"When we fulfill our duties as the Sri Lanka Freedom Party we give top priority for the country and its citizens," the President said.
"Even though criticisms were leveled against the family of Bandaranaike as one of the political dynasty families in Sri Lanka, they have rendered a great service to the country and they are exemplary political characters to the society."
President Sirisena and several others paid floral tribute to the statue of Sirimavo Bandaranaike at the commencement of the felicitation ceremony.
The copies of Sinhala and Tamil versions of the book titled Sirimavo was presented to the President by Sunethra Bandaranaike.
The President also launched the official website of Sirimavo Bandaranaike.
The commemorative stamp issued to mark the 100th birth anniversary of Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike was also presented to the President.
The President presented awards to the winners of the debate competition organised island-wide parallel to the 100th birth anniversary of Sirimavo Bandaranaike.
The Maha Sangha including other religious leaders, ministers and MPs, including Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, family members of the Bandaranaike family, including, former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, Sunethra Bandaranaike and members of the SLFP participated in this event.
