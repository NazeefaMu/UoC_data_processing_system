Fungal disease spreading  in tea plants with onset of rains

The tea plants in Balangoda estates extending to 3,000 acres have contracted a fungal disease due to the adverse weather.
Due to the disease, the harvest has dropped by 50 percent, the small tea estate owners said.
The rainy and misty weather these days has been the cause of this disease.
The tea plantations in Ellepola, Gawaranhena, Heramitigala, Thorawelakanda, Massanna, Waleboda, Samanalawatta, Rassagala, Rawanakanda, Wevelwatta, Uwella, Marathenna, Seethagala etc have been affected by the disease.
Dark patches are visible on the tea leaves and the most tender leaves fall due to the disease.
The Duty Officer of the Small Tea Estate Development Authority of Balangoda Branch said six to eight ounces of 50 percent copper spray mixed into 15 gallons of water should be sprayed to an acre of a tea estate to get rid of the disease.
He added that the mixture should be sprayed once a week after harvesting. He said the situation would be controlled after February with better weather.
