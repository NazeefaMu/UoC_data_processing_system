Germany-SL Trade Grow by 40% in 3 Years – Ambassador Rohde

Bilateral trade between Germany and Sri Lanka has grown steadily by 40% during the last three years and Germany was optimistic of Sri Lanka’s further potential, Ambassador of Germany to Sri Lanka Jörn Rohde said recently.
“We are not here to connect only the governments but also its people. Key areas are increasing business relations between Germany and Sri Lanka. Last few years trade between Germany and Sri Lanka grew by 40%. Last year alone German exports to Sri Lanka grew by eight per cent,” said Ambassador Rohde who was the chief guest at an annual event of one of Germany’s foremost global manufacturers in the field of electrical and building installation technology – OBO Bettermann Holding GmbH & Co. KG.
“This year in March we opened a German trade delegation in Sri Lanka. The opening of this trade will ensure that trade between the two countries will boom. In fact, this year Germany and Sri Lanka celebrated 65 years of diplomatic relations. We are hopeful of greater ties between the two countries,” he added.
“I am extremely happy to be here. I won’t relate too much on OBO Bettermann because I don’t know too much about its line of business. But when I saw the motto – Thinking connected, I guess we are in the same line of business as we are trying to do the same things. My line of business is connecting Germany with Sri Lanka, not only governments but also its peoples,” iterated the Ambassador.
OBO Bettermann which globally has over 4,000 employees, is spread across 60 countries and 40 subsidiaries in Europe and overseas. The brand has been in Sri Lanka since the mid nineties, and started its own office in 2011.
“It is a great honour and privilege for me to be in Sri Lanka for this momentous occasion. We build connections through devices and equipment that conduct electricity, route data and control energy,” Ralf Hennemann Director of Sales and strategy for Sri Lanka, Middle-East and North Africa said addressing the gathering.
Hardi Jabir, Director of Sales and Marketing for Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bangladesh and the Maldives iterated that the Company strives for the greatest-possible transparency for its employees and customers and towards this end, all of the Company’s objectives, processes and data are continuously measured, depicted and, wherever possible, improved on.(AK)
