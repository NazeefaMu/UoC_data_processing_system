Pet Comfort

Whether it’s a passenger fearful of flying, someone coping poorly with a past traumatic situation, or a student who gets nervous before tak­ing tests, an increasing number of people are leaning on animals to provide comfort.
While such “emotional support ani­mals” (ESAs) serve a genuine purpose for many people, they have stirred much con­troversy in recent years, notably on airplanes, such as when a woman on a cross-country flight was not at all happy when she had to sit next to a very large Dalmatian, which was on the owner’s lap. On another plane, a man was bitten on the face by a U.S. Marine’s emotional support dog. Then there was the time, in 2014, when Ivana Trump (the president’s first ex-wife) brought her miniature Yorkie into a high-end restaurant in New York City, showing a therapy animal card—but drawing com­plaints from other patrons.
Numerous websites will sell you every­thing from a service vest for the animal and a certification card to a note from a licensed psychologist to claim your animal as an ESA. Is all this legit—or just a pretense to be able to travel, eat out, shop, and sightsee with your pet, or live in housing that doesn’t allow ani­mals? After all, ESAs come with perks beyond the comfort they provide, including that they get to fly in an airline cabin free of charge (as opposed to flying as checked baggage or cargo, for a fee). Here’s the low­down on this growing animal movement.
What is an emotional support animal, and how is it different from a service or therapy animal?
Also called companion animals, ESAs provide comfort to people with emotional or psychological issues, which may include depression, anxiety, social pho­bias, or panic attacks, for example. In contrast, under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), a “service ani­mal” typically refers to a dog that has been trained to do specific tasks for people with physical, psychiatric, or intellectual dis­abilities to help them in their day-to-day activities—such as a guide dog for the blind or a dog that signals when its owner is about to have a seizure. “Therapy ani­mals” provide support for people affected by illness, disaster, or other stressors, such as in hospitals, nursing homes, and schools. Neither ESAs nor therapy ani­mals are covered by ADA.
What animals can qualify as ESAs?
Though ESAs are typically dogs or cats, they can be any domestic animal, including not only rabbits, mice, ferrets, and guinea pigs, but also snakes, ducks, and potbellied pigs. The only stipulations are that the ani­mal can’t be a health or safety threat to other people and the owner must be able to keep it under control in public so it doesn’t become a nuisance. Also, the ani­mal can’t be one that’s illegal to own, such as certain exotic or any wild animals.
What kind of training does an ESA require?
Unlike service dogs, ESAs don’t require any special training to do their job: The idea is that the mere presence of the animal helps someone with an emotional disability live independently and adapt to stressful situa­tions. In fact, a current pet—even 15-year-old Fluffy—can be designated an ESA as long as a licensed mental health professional affirms that it provides therapeutic benefit.
How do you get an ESA?
Requirements for obtaining an ESA are fairly loosey-goosey. There are no national standards, and no registration or certifica­tion for the animal is needed. Basically, you just have to be diagnosed with a psycho­logical condition that would benefit from having the animal. Airlines and property managers most likely will require a letter from a licensed mental health professional or medical doctor who can provide a diagnosis. It must be on letterhead and declare, among other things, the particular psychological condition you have and that the animal is important for your psychological well-being.
Can you have more than one ESA?
Yes. But again, a mental health professional would have to determine if that would be beneficial. And the documentation pro­vided would have to note what each animal is contributing to the easing of symptoms.
Can you take an ESA everywhere?
To many—but not all—places. If an apart­ment building, condo, or other public or privately-owned dwelling doesn’t allow pets, this policy must, with some exceptions, be waived for emotionally disabled people with ESAs under the Fair Housing Act (similar to how people in wheelchairs must be accommodated for their physical dis­abilities). Many colleges and universities now allow ESAs on campus and in campus hous­ing. And, as noted above, commercial airlines must accommodate passengers flying with ESAs. But restaurants, stores, taxis, buses, beaches, and libraries, for example, are not required to allow them, as they must service dogs. In other places, such as public schools, ESAs are rarely permitted.
Regarding air travel, it’s best to contact the airline to verify what documentation is required and whether there are any restrictions (such as size) on the animal you can bring on board. Some airlines are favoring a ban on ESAs—or at least restricting the types of animals allowed. berkeleywellness
