SLIIT commences student enrolments for Curtin University

Cementing its longest standing foreign university partnership of over 17 years, SLIIT commenced the annual 2019 student intake for undergraduate degree programs for Curtin University, Australia, recently.
Recognised among the top 1% of universities worldwide according to globally accepted QS World University Rankings, Curtin University, Australia, is also a member of the International Association of Universities (IAU) and the Association of Commonwealth Universities (ACU). Students enrolled to this degree in Sri Lanka have the added benefit of their degree also being accepted by Sri Lanka’s apex body, the University Grants Commission (UGC). “We are pleased to announce the commencement of the new 2019 intake of students for the internationally recognised Curtin University, Australia, degree programmes. This year’s enrollment further strengthens the ties between our two institutions as we continue to produce high-calibre graduates for the nation and beyond,” said Prof. Lalith Gamage, CEO, SLIIT.
Renowned internationally for the quality of its programs, the Curtin University degrees that can be completed entirely in Sri Lanka are the Bachelor of Science Computing degrees in Software Engineering and Information Technology and the Bachelor of Science in Computer Systems and Networking. Delivered through SLIIT’s Faculty of Computing, upon completion of the BSc Computing degrees in the Software Engineering & Information Technology majors, graduates receive the esteemed Australian Computer Society (ACS) Accreditation.
The Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) program degrees are offered in Civil and Construction Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and in Electrical and Electronic Engineering. Led by SLIIT’s Faculty of Engineering, graduates are eligible to apply for the prestigious Engineers Australia (EA) Accreditation.
In addition to these impressive programmes conducted at SLIIT, students may also choose to get global exposure, by completing their degrees at Curtin’s Bentley Campus in Perth, Australia, or any one of Curtin’s offshore campuses in Malaysia, Dubai and Singapore.
Prof. Mahesha Kapurubandara, Dean, International, SLIIT stated, “SLIIT and Curtin University have enjoyed an enviable partnership. Curtin’s growing reputation has seen the university rapidly rise in international rankings in recent years and we are proud to create pathways for local and international students. We look forward to welcoming our new intake for 2019.”
