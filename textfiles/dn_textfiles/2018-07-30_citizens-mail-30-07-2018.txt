[CITIZENS' Mail - (30-07-2018)]

Think twice before executing
This is in sequence to the letters of Cat Kumarage and R.M.B. Senanayake and sensible contributions made by the other ‘citizens’ to this column. Please let our President to decide to do it purely on a trial basis for two years for murder committed in the future from a given date. In absence of positive results we can withdraw it.
As a form of mitigation, if the victim has been unarmed and innocent, capital punishment should be carried out. Best example is the present day self-styled ‘rape and murder’ and gang shooting in robberies.
Our government owes an explanation and a justification to the Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, European Union and the six nations openly raising their objections. We should solicit forbearance from all of them as we want to do it only in the case of killing ‘innocents’ and not for ‘contributory participation’ and that too on a tentative trial basis. Surely all of them will withdraw and prudently uphold our view.
If the victim too has “contributed” to a certain extent, say by involving in a quarrel or heated argument and not avoiding when he could have apparently done so, it should be viewed differently. “Contributory participation” does not make the victim “totally innocent”. Nevertheless, the tendency is there to fabricate false evidence to transform an active participant into an ‘innocent’ artificially. Therefore, so much caution should be exercised to prevent such misrepresentation.
It was reported in the daily press (Sinhala) on July 7 that during past six months 214 murders have been committed - more than one murder a day!
It is all commonsense that if a man knows that if he kills another man, he too will have to pay back with his own life, he will think twice before plotting to kill. There is definitely a deterrent effect and no sane and honest person can deny it.
Killing a man is as simple as cutting down a tree. People are killed for simple reasons like jealousy, land disputes, personal and political grudges, non-payment of a personal loan, robbery etc. This issue has come up to the most dangerous proportion warranting much more severe punishment than now.
Those who are objecting keep their “eyes closed” until the crime is committed and then “open their eyes” only after the killer has accomplished his deadly mission. Then they start talking in sympathy with the murderer but not a word about the innocent dependants. This issue should be viewed in the correct perspective of a “constructive step” in the direction of “preventing” a deadly crime. Please let our President explain all these facts very clearly and emphatically to everyone opposing and present a motion to the Parliament to implement death penalty for killing unarmed innocents, taking case by case and not if the victim has “contributed” to the act of murder as stated above. Video recording clips and graphic presentations of gang shootings are shown on the TV screen and they look like “cow-boy” pictures and should be shown to the aforesaid international organizations as well.
It looks as if killing so fancifully is also a “Human Right” in our beautiful country.
The “killer” knows that even if a few dozen people are killed and then judgment is given for him to be hanged until dead, he has a guarantee from one side that he will be facilitated to live his full span of life with free food and lodging and Jail Guards’ protection at state expense. On top of it, they also get sympathy from international and local organisations. Some of our politicians are there to shed “Crocodile Tears” in public.
Please let the intellectual ‘citizens’ put due pressure on the government collectively to promote this motion.
