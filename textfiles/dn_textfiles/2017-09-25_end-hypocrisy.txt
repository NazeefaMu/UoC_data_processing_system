End this hypocrisy

Echoing the views of his ministerial colleague Mangala Samaraweera, Tourism and Christian Affairs Minister John Amaratunga has called for the relaxing of restrictions placed on the sale of soft liquor. Answering an Oral question raised by MP Buddhika Pathirana in parliament of Friday, Minister Amaratunga said they plan to remove restrictions on soft liquor sales by way of a budget proposal. He would be requesting the Minister of Finance to ease laws pertaining to soft liquor such as beer and wine so that light alcohol beverages would be freely available. Availability of soft liquor is essential for the tourism industry. Soft liquor is available in almost all shops in other countries promoting the tourism industry, whereas the opposite is true of Sri Lanka, the Minister observed.
Earlier Minister Mangala Samaraweera too called for the easing of restrictions on soft liquor to wean the imbiber away from hard liquor that was more injurious to health. Not only that, he also called for the lifting of the liquor sales ban on Poya days, which he said had the largest volume of liquor sales than on any other day, with bootleggers stockpiling the ‘stuff’ to sell at double the price and even Wine Shop owners enjoying booming sales by disposing of their liquor from the back door, to known customers.
It is time that our archaic excise laws are changed, in order to relax, or, altogether remove restrictions on liquor sales. This is because it is next to impossible to wean the habitual drinker away from the bottle. It is also moot whether the hard liquor drinker can be made to convert to soft liquor by reducing the price of soft liquor. The best course is to reduce the price of ALL legally manufactured liquor in order to keep the hard drinker away from the rot gut, or kassippu, which has lethal consequences. Today, the price of the cheapest brand of local liquor is Rs 1,500, which is beyond the purse of the average income earner. He will naturally turn to the homemade brew, which is much cheaper, to deadly effect. The government which may hope to collect additional revenue through the increase of excise duties will only be losing any such revenue so earned, several fold, on the treatment of diseases connected to consumption of rot gut, thus drilling a big hole in its health budget annually. It is therefore feasible that a moratorium be placed on liquor price increase, as even suggested by minister Samaraweera, so that the genuine ‘stuff’ is enjoyed by the habitual drinker, after a hard day’s work.
We say this because trying to reduce the drinking habit through projects like mathata thitha will not work. In any event mathata thitha was a big hoax, because wine stores began mushrooming even when the campaign was in full swing, with politicians freely issuing liquor permits to the businessmen who bankrolled their election campaigns (as one wag declared it was thithata matha). Even campaigns carried out on television by the redoubtable Prof Carlo Fonseka blacking out scenes in films depicting consumption of alcohol, and later, slogans to the effect that one would lose one's virility by taking to liquor, no doubt, failed to convince the imbiber.
Be that as it may, the hypocrisy surrounding the government's liquor policy, where liquor prices are jacked up for the stated objective of weaning the imbiber away from the bottle should cease. It (government) should come to terms with reality and desist from using the price stick to control the drinking habit. Recent surveys showed liquor sales remained the same, or, if at all, had even jumped, after the price increase. One has only to observe the jostling crowds at liquor outlets on the day before a Poya to get a clear picture.
Late minister Jeyaraj Fernandopulle was frank enough to declare that his government's mathata thitha programme did not work in the Negombo area from where he hailed. He famously declared in parliament that those in his area began the day after a couple ape peththe minissu dekak dala thamai patanganne. Even the late Harold Herat, who hailed from the Dankotuwa area, went to the extent of requesting the government to permit pot arrack manufacture, as a cottage industry, although the suggestion drew flak from President Premadasa. Minister John Amaratunga, also representing an electorate known for its large volume of liquor sales, no doubt knows what he is talking about. He, together with Managala Samaraweera, certainly would not be favourites with the Buddhist clergy and temperance movements, for their advocacy of relaxed excise laws. But they, at least, had spoken out with conviction. Even Prof. G. L. Peiris as deputy minister of finance under Chandrika called for the slashing of prices on soft liquor, such as beer and wine. He argued that reduction of prices on soft liquor would make hard liquor drinkers switch to beer and wine. He also argued that the shortfall in revenue would be made up by the sheer weight in the numbers who will convert to soft liquor. Whether this actually happened is anyone's guess.
