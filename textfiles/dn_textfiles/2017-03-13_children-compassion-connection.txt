Children, Compassion, Connection

Rabindranath Tagore once translated into words, a thought that all of us carry deep within us. “Every child comes with the message that God is not yet discouraged of man.”
It is true, is it not, that, like a tiny rose bud waiting for the warmth of the sun to open her petals, gently, softly, one tiny petal at a time, children come to us with hearts full of love, minds abundant with innocence, hands outstretched with trust. Left on their own, they will transcend borders, connect with each other as easily as a butterfly connects with a flower.
Unlike adults, children have more ways to connect, more potential to connect, more possibilities to connect. It is through our children that we can best bring down the borders we adults, blinded by greed, and thirst for power, misled by pseudo religious beliefs, have created among us.
When we look around us we see that we are surrounded by prejudice, violence and environmental endangerment. We know that these symptoms of a malicious disease which will one day destroy us altogether are not confined to a single nation or group of people. These are global maladies that affect all of us – whether we live in a mud hut in a small village in Unawatuna in Southern Sri Lanka or in a cottage in Namche bazaar, nestling against the Everest Mountains in Nepal. Yet, if we look more carefully we would see that love and compassion too are all around us, in places both obvious and subtle. It was obvious at the South Asian Literature conference held from 26th to 28th February, in Delhi this year, where writers and poets, hailing from seven different countries, brought up in seven different cultures, worshiping different deities, speaking different languages came together as one, united family. But where do we see love and compassion in subtle ways? How do we discreetly encourage young people to envision and emotionally connect to events and experiences that may be the same or quite different to what they are familiar with, helping them to unite with their foreign brethren?
Through children's literature. Through stories that offer portraits of characters and communities who seek, discover and convey, in different contexts, love and compassion. By tapping into the untrammeled minds of children through stories that encourage them to see all living beings as one, rather than as “the other”, we can create a future in which the word 'border' will have only one meaning: that of an ornamental strip or design around the edge of a printed page.
It was towards the end of colonial rule that literature written and published specifically for children in our country first began, when writers like Cumaratunga Munidasa, Martin Wickramasinghe and G.B Senanayake wrote the first books for children in Sinhala. Pre-colonial literature for children was oral in nature, passed down by adults in the form of folk tales, myths, songs, riddles and proverbs. During a good half of the colonial period, children’s reading was confined to textbooks and western literature which promoted western culture and values. However, political independence gained in 1948, led to the development of an intellectual climate that paved the way for children’s literature written and published indigenously. These books were predominantly written in Sinhala. Children's literature, written in English by Sri Lankan writers emerged only in the 1980s.
Chinua Achebe said it best when he wrote about the Nigerian child:
“Before 1960 Nigerian children read nothing but British children’s books and had to be left to figure out what was meant by Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, Trafalgar Square and the Thames – subjects and images which convey no meaning and no feeling to the average Nigerian child in his natural environment.”
Although Achebe refers here to Nigerian children, this statement can be applied to many children in various countries under British rule.
Today, however, children can identify themselves with the characters in their books, for, even though the language is English the stories are set in familiar backgrounds with familiar images. This also means these books provide 'windows' to children of neighbouring countries, giving them a glimpse of another country, her people, her culture.
Let me take as examples, two books written by Sri Lankan writers, Sybil Wettasinghe and Prof. J.B Disanayaka. They have broken the cultural imperialism of the west through their work and highlighted everything that is not a part of the Eurocentric white society, ironically,using the white man's language and fortunately too, for in spite of all the negative effects of colonial rule we did inherit a common language with which we can connect with others of our region and beyond, thanks to our colonizers.
In Sybil Wettasinghe's 'A Jump Over the Moon', on a moonlit night, Puncha tells his grandfather and grandmother, Mutta and Attamma, he can jump over the moon. Not believing he can do it Mutta and Attamma promises Puncha a bicycle if he jumps over the moon, but without hurting himself. Puncha brings a basin full of water into the garden, and watches it till the moon is reflected in the water. He jumps over the moon's reflection and wins the bet.
In J.B Disanayaka's 'Who's Afraid of Devils?', Gamarala finds a devil living in the tall tree in the middle of his land. The devil claims the land is his and argues with the Gamarala. In the end they agree that Gamarala will share with the devil, the upper, or the lower end of whatever crop he harvests. But each season the devil fails to get the crop as the Gamarala cleverly makes variations in the crops he plants; one year he plants yams so that the devil who gets the upper part is left with the yam leaves, the next year he plants grains and the devil is left with the roots of the vines and so on and so forth. Finally, defeated, the devil agrees to leave the tree and settles down in another place.
These two texts written by two of the most prolific Sri Lankan writers of children's literature in English, differ from one another in many ways. Wettasinghe's 'A Jump over the Moon' is a realistic portrayal of fairly ordinary human life. Disanayaka's 'Who is Afraid of Devils?' is a folk tale of the Sinhalese, retold in English.
It might seem surprising that texts so diverse could so easily scale the boundaries that divide us and show young readers the differences between the children of another country and themselves, but at the same time help them to perceive that there are important things that all human beings have in common.
One striking familiarity in both texts that help achieve this goal, is the language. The diction is simple. The style is straightforward. There is minimal description of the characters or places. Instead, the story moves forward with a consistent focus on actions – on what people say or do rather than on why they do it or what they are thinking of, as they do it thereby making it easier for readers of other cultures to understand the story.
To sum up, 'A Jump over the Moon' is a realistic story from which a reader from another culture can learn about ordinary lives of Sri Lankans. And, 'Who is Afraid of Devils?' is a Sinhala folk tale that promotes cultural understanding in young readers from other countries. The underlying theme in each of these children's books written in English reflect the words of the eminent Sri Lankan poet Mahagama Sekera as written in his book titled Bodima.

Through books such as the ones discussed here we can develop empathy, awareness and sensitivity towards other cultures in our children, change perspectives and guide them to put themselves into the shoes of a person from a different culture.
If we promote children's literature written in English by the native writers of our countries there is no doubt that reaching beyond borders, heralding peace and harmony throuhout the world will no longer be a fairy tale.
