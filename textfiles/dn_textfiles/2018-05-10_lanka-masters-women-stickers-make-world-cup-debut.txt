Lanka Masters Women stickers to make World Cup debut

For the first time a Sri Lanka Masters women national hockey team will be competing in the Master’s World Cup to be held in Barcelona, Spain from 27 July to 5 August.
Officials from Sri Lanka Masters Hockey Association (SLMHA) announced the participating team at a press conference held at the Duncan White Auditorium yesterday with Minister of Sports Faiszer Mustapha and patron of SLMHA Rauff Hakeem, Leader of Sri Lanka Muslim Congress and Minister of City Planning and Water Supply present.
The Sri Lanka Masters women will compete in the +35 category against formidable opponents such as Australia, England, New Zealand, Ghana, USA and host Spain. Sri Lanka will be led by former national captain Sobitha Mendis and coached by former national hockey captain M.G.M. Naleen.
“We are extremely proud and excited to represent Sri Lanka at the world stage event for the very first time,” said captain Sobitha Mendis. “Our team comprises veterans who have played for the Sri Lanka team and who have brought glory and fame to the country and to the game in the past.”
Minister of Sports Faiszer Mustapha speaking at the occasion said, “We request and invite corporate sectors to support worthy causes like this event. As a Ministry we will always be there for the betterment of sports at any stage.”
Patron of SLMHA Rauff Hakeem, Leader of Sri Lanka Muslim Congress and Minister of City Planning and Water Supply also shared Mustapha’s views.
“M.G.M. Naleen requested me to be a patron for this association and I also thank former Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara who help to accredit the association with the Ministry of Sports because during the registration of SLMHA we faced lot of obstacles from Sri Lanka Hockey Association, but with support from Jayasekara we were able to register ourselves with the Ministry of Sports,” said Hakeem.
