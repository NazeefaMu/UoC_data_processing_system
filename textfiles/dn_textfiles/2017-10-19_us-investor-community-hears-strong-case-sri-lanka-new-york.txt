The Governor added that the Central Bank is well advanced in putting in place a flexible inflation targeting regime and added, “the narrative is that the macroeconomics are improving, you have a tremendous location, you have a shift to a growth model which is capable of giving you more sustainable growth and the policies are being put in place to support that growth model.
The growth framework is being strengthened through action in terms of the investment climate, investment promotion, trade facilitation and trade policy complemented by a pipeline of very ambitious projects. Sri Lanka has raised its ambition because it is now getting support from all corners of the world.”
