ATAPATTU from zeroes to hero

MARVAN SAMSON ATAPATTU was a renowned willow wielder, leader and captain par excellence. His cricketing career was a fabled story of one who from a run of zeroes ended hero.
Born on November 22, 1970 and hailing from Kalutara, ATAPATTU was a star to behold as an opening batsman. His motoring skills were used to steer the ball to any part of the field with feline grace and electric power.
Generally south paws are acknowledged as the most stylish, but ATAPATTU a right handed batsman knocked that belief into a cocked hat, as he watched and followed the ball leave the bowlers hand, got it to make contact with the bat, and with rare world timing directed the ball stylishly all over the field or over it using the bat like a wand like a magician would do.
Showed inborn talent
As a teenager from the time he held a bat in school, he showed inborn natural talent and had a style that was revealing to his coaches who had only a little chiseling to do to shape him into a batsman of the classical mould which shape and style he maintained throughout his glittering career.
ATAPATTU first served notice of his immense skills at Mahinda College, Galle where his first coach Major G.W.S. de Silva was amazed at his talent. His talents did not go unnoticed and he soon took wing to Colombo and Ananda College.
He came under the eagle eyed and talented coach P.W. Perera who further enhanced his talents, showed him how and put him on the highway to success locally and internationally.
Scintillating century
I was witness to a scintillating century he scored against my school St.Benedict’s College on the turf at Kotahena. I watched in awe his all round stroke play, his polished footwork and timing-- which batting is all about-- as he with supreme grace notched that three figure score. With that he announced his arrival to the Country's cricketing portals. . And he underlined that belief as his career grew in stature.
At Ananda College he scored bagsful of runs in inter-school cricket and then threw in his lot with the Sinhalese Sports Club where his run glut continued. The Sri Lankan selectors of that time did not take long to plonk him into the Sri Lanka squad as a 20-year old.
But his baptism in big time cricket was a calamity. In his first six innings for the country he made five zeros and then a single which critics believe was an extra as the ball had not made contact with the bat! In that era the umpire’s word was law and so the scorer recorded it as a run.
Baying for his blood
What is vivid in my memory is this. Critics were baying for his blood for his repeated failures and I was one of them being the cricket writer in the ‘Daily Mirror’ and ‘Times of Ceylon’. When I happened to run into the then batting sensation the right handed Aravinda de Silva, he knowing my cricketing background asked me to hold my fire and not demoralize and destroy the youngster and that it would not be long before he made waves. And de Silva’s prediction did not take long to realize. ATAPATTU became a HERO from zero. The rise was phenomenal.
It must be recalled that great world batsmen had opened their careers that were to glitter later with ducks. In that bracket hung the names of Sir Leonard Hutton, Graham Gooch and present day TV Commentator Mike Atherton who all later went on to captain England.
Repertoire of strokes
While he had the ability with a repertoire of strokes, but what was excellent and eye catching was when he played the square cuts and the cover and on drives. He made his Test debut in 1990 fronting up to India and played his final Test in 2007 against Australia. ODI debut was in 1990 against India and his last ODI was also against India in 2007.
The dream of captaining the country came to AtAPATTU in 2003. He proved a clever thinking captain and won games. He had to prematurely give up the captaincy when he picked up a recurring painful back injury which continued to trouble him.
ATAPATTU proved an able opening partner with the dashing Sanath Jayasuriya. The stylish right hander scored one of his best centuries when he made a memorable 185 against England in the holy land of cricket Lord’s when he opened with Jayasuriya.
Same opposition
Before that knock he scored 201 against the same opposition in a Galle Test. He kept Jayasuriya company as opener when the pair put on a stand of 335 against Pakistan in Kandy. He made an unbeaten 207 while Jayasuriya who led the team made 188. He later had many double hundreds.
ATAPATTU was a clever leader of men and his team mates had the highest respect and regard for him. After retirement he turned his attention to coaching and coached Canada for a short period in 2009. He was head coach of Singapore for 12 months.
After the 2011 World Cup ATAPATTU was asked to be the batting coach of the Sri Lanka team and supported Australian Stuart Law who was the interim coach, bowling coach Champaka Ramanayake and fielding coach Ruwan Kalpage on the tour of England.
Coaching abilities
ATAPATTU’s coaching abilities did not go unnoticed and he was appointed Interim head coach in 2014. During his tenure Sri Lanka won its First Test series in England in 16 years with a 1-0 win. The official head coach title was not long in coming and it did come in 2014. But unfortunately after Test series loses to Pakistan and India, ATAPATTU threw in the towel and gracefully resigned in 2015.
But as always been the case, when the team loses it is the captain and the coach who have their necks on the block. But when the team wins all get the credit. It was no different with ATAPATTU being blamed for the defeats and not wanting to be further scourged he quit.
