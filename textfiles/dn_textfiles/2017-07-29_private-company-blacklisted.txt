Private company blacklisted

Cocaine haul in sugar container:
The private company that supplied a questionable sugar container to Lanka Sathosa in which a huge cocaine haul was detected on July 19 has been blacklisted, Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen said.
The minister, replying to a supplementary question by Chief Government Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, told Parliament yesterday that the private company would not be allowed to import anything to Lanka Sathosa until the inquiry is over.
The minister said 130 suppliers have been registered to supply goods to Lanka Sathosa, and Ranjitha Pulses Splitting & Processing Industry Ltd was among them.
“The company had been registered to supply 500 MT of sugar. The cocaine haul was detected in a sugar container sent to Ratmalana Economic Centre. The Sathosa workers who recovered it informed the Police. Sathosa has no whatsoever link to this cocaine haul. Since I assumed this ministerial portfolio, I have never imported any goods to Sathosa,” Bathiudeen said.
