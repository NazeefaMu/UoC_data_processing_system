‘SAHAYAM SPECIALS’ were a brand name in rugby

Trinity College, Kandy has not only a rich history in producing academics who have reached the top echelons, but also sportsmen who glittered like gems, especially in rugby and cricket and hit the top. They brought great honour to the school and country.
It is said that many are called, but few are chosen be it in sport or any other field or endeavor. Two of the most outstanding sportsmen who stood like beacons in the light were MOHAN SAHAYAM in rugby and KUMAR SANGAKKARA in cricket.
This week ‘SPORTS LEGENDS’ shines its spotlight on a ruggerite who made from a special mold the likes of which are rarely seen---not at least in the half century this writer has been penning. He had natural skills to take the schools, club and country’s scene not like a storm but like a tsunami and that tsunami was MOHAN SAHAYAM.
Rise to fame
During his rise to fame there were many other ruggerites in the school who were good and threatening, but SAHAYAM kicked them all to touch and sliced through the defence of schools and clubs and even international opponents like a lion in attack during his career.
In school he was a natural when playing in his pet position as fly half and then his natural ability turned majestic as his career unwound and there was no rugby player or fan who did not savor his fantastic and amazing play when the oval ball was in his possession. Even today rugby fans who watched SAHAYAM work magic with the ball still talk in awe of his play.
SAHAYAM was not only a amazing ruggerite having won the coveted Lion at Trinity , but also showcased his prowess in cricket and athletics. And there was also the special charm he brought to the clubhouses with his effervescent sense of humor. But it was the rugby Gods who had a special place for him.
He was a legend
As a try scorer he was a legend. Try scoring which helped his sides to victory came like a river in spate with his clever body swerve that sent his opponents on the wrong lane as he sliced through to plant the ball under the posts or within the scoring area while the opponents watched in amazement.
Spectators would be drawn to the venues like moths to a flame. Such was the drawing power he commanded. And those who came to watch seldom left disappointed, but speaking in glowing terms on their way to their vehicles or buses to get home.
At the time I oversaw the Sports Desk of the Times of Ceylon, when it was known that SAHAYAM would be in action we would send the best of reporters to write back in time for the Sunday edition. In the era that SAHAYAM excelled every newspaper would flag headlines about his clever play and strategy he employed to fool the defence and plant the try ball by that signaled victory. Effusive copy written by rugby experts such as Eustace Rulach a former Trinity cricket captain, Percy Beling, M.B.Marjan, M.V. Muhsin, Austin Daniel, T.M.K. Samat, N.Thangaraja and free lance writer Sham de Alwis decorated the pages.
Widely read Sunday column
Also Subbiah Muttiah, Editor of the ‘Sunday Times’ a knowledgeable and keen sport fan -- what he didn’t known of sports was not worth knowing ---would take special delight in describing SAHAYAM’S magic play in his widely read column ‘CORNER FLAG’.
After his school career SAHAYAM took wing to CR and FC and many were the matches and trophies he won for the club assisting his team mates and showing and inspiring them to victory. SAHAYAN had been in losing teams but that was few and far between.
True victory was not the thing, but everything. But to SAHAYAM the game was the thing. He would play the game, yet hard, take career threatening tackles and give back and after the grueling game, camaraderie and bonhomie was what he also excelled in over a mug that cheers with his opponents. He was also a fine raconteur to boot.
Aladdin’s lamp is rubbed
Here’ a gem from M.V. Muhsin, a school mate of SAHAYAM, from the popular column ‘PAVILION PARADE’ he wrote for the ’SUNDAY OBSERVER’. ‘ Zaruk slings out a long pass to SAHAYAM. Aladdin’s lamp is rubbed and then the ‘magic’ unfolds: SAHAYAM collects the ball, pretends to toss it in the air, then fakes a pass, and appears to recapture it. Time’s winged chariot seems to be at his back as he changes direction and in a compelling move makes the lightening field look so plodgy. It is so fast and flash as he darts his way through 35 yards.
‘The players seem frozen. It is so fast and slick that the crowds’ cheers suddenly choke off. It is so fast and elegant that the sound of marvel, for a moment, dies in their throats. And then the reality dawns: that the instantly classic signature of the ‘SAHAYAM SPECIAL’ has been delivered. The crowd bursts into a deafening roar’.
They were great buddies
Here’s more. SAHAYAM and Keith Paul were great buddies although SAHAYAM came from Trinity and Paul from Royal. Muhsin writes – SAHAYAM had dash and dazzle and Paul had art and craft.
‘They would at times borrow these attribute from each other. Yet SAHAYAM was flashy and outgoing while Paul was reserved and introspective. Their divine call and gift was common: rugby. Their goal was to win. But their credo was to do so with an absolute gentlemanly flavor and fervor.
Their friendship continued and when they met when SAHAYAM visited Toronto at a felicitation at the residence of Trinity Lion Sam Canagasabey and wife Ranjini in the company of over 50 guests. It was Keith Paul who sprang the ’special’ this time. He gifted the rugger ball used in the 1964 Bradby with the name of the players inscribed on it to his buddy SAHAYAM who was emotionally overwhelmed by the gesture of goodwill and graciousness
Like selling ‘wadays’
Here’s what Sharm de Alwis who can be described as the walking, talking Trinity ‘WISDEN” wrote about SAHAYAM. ‘Mohan sold dummies like he was selling ‘waday’. He would smile whilst drawing a sale and on a few occasions he sold dummies even to spectators which were bought by the dumbfounded aggressor, as Mohan planted the try and held the upright as he laughed into the wind. He was the ‘smiling assassin’ who was also known as the ‘Golden Boy’ of the country’s rugby.
‘Mohan’s portrait is in the ‘HUNDED YEARS OF RUGBY FOOTBALL IN SRI LANKA.’ The book states, ‘In 1964, there appeared in the club ranks, whom writers described as one of the most brilliant players for many years.
MOHAN SAHAYAM who captained Trinity that year, turned out for CR&FC in the Clifford Cup tournament received the highest praise for his brilliant play as a fly-half. The descriptions were superlatives, matching the praise given to A.Blair 40 years earlier.’
In that era the Havelocks- CR&FC game was the derby of rugby. It attracted young beauties in their numbers and it was at one such socials that SAHAYAM planted the ‘SAHAYAM EXTRA SPECIAL’ under the post and converted it himself in PENNY and they are still pairing off well.
