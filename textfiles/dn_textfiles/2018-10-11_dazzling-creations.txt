Dazzling creations

Madhuka Dilhani Tilakaratna of Bulugahapitiya nearly two kilo metres off Eheliyagoda town is a talented Gem Studding Artist who has fully mastered this art form of a different nature.
She has won the President's Silver award for her gem art work at the 'Shilpa Abhimani' Handicraft National Competition, 2017. “This art piece that depicts a fresco of Kelani viharaya was purchased by the Chief Monk of the temple,” she recalled.
The Gem art form is being created by applying a strong adhesive on the selected art sketch and carefully studding very tiny gem related stones on the sketch. These small pieces are obtained by grinding different sized gem stones using a small grinder.
"This art form is similar to a meditation and it needs patience," Dilhani explained.
She has also won a bronze award at the Sabaragamuwa Provincial Commercial Industrial Competition 2017. She was one of the three artists chosen to represent Sri Lanka at the 'Saarc Handicrafts Industrial Exhibition-2017 held in Bangladesh. Her trade name is "Gemlife." She creates small as well as large-sized gem arts. She at times creates 7x3 feet creations which takes her one or two months. Dilhani hopes to reach out the foreign market in the near future with her creations.
