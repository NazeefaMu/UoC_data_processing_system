Sporting grace of injured warriors

The heroics of true heroes will be showcased when the final phase of the 19th Army Para Games worked off from October 12 to 14 at the Diyagama Mahinda Rajapaksa Stadium. This was disclosed to the media during a press briefing at the Kingsbury Hotel last evening.
The 2016th edition commenced in April where nearly 1000 Army Para athletes vying for supremacy in 12 Para sports disciplines namely, Archery, Badminton, Shooting, Table Tennis, Wheelchair Tennis, Sitting Volleyball, Rowing, Power Lifting, Cycling, Wheelchair Marathon, Swimming. The climax of the meet, Athletics Championship will be followed by the award presentation and closing ceremony.
Para sports in Army have an illustrious history since the inaugural Army Para Games in 1991. Para sports were introduced to the Army with the aim to reinforce the rehabilitation process of the men injured in battle who were at Ranawiru Sevana. Later all the infantry units were invited and the event became the apex Army Para sports event. This event did not conduct in some years when the Army was fully engaged with battle against the separatists.
Addressing the media, Army Para Games Committee chairman Maj. Gen. Channa Gunathilaka explained how the cause of Army Para Games changed over the years and became the cradle of Sri Lanka’s international level Para athletes who brought fame and glory to motherland.
“Today we have in our fold 2014 Asia Para Games’ T42 100m and 200m champion Anil Prasanna Jayalath who also created a record in 200m. Pradeep Sanjaya won the T46 400m bronze in 2012 London Paralympics. In 2014 Army athletes secured 100m and 200m bronze medals in Asian Para Games. Army’s dominance in Para sports was evident in recent times. Sri Lanka was represented by nine athletes at the Rio Paralympics 2016 and eight of them were from Army. Dinesh Priyantha Herath won the solitary medal for Sri Lanka as he clinched the bronze in men’s javelin throw F46 event. So Army has shown continues progress and has become the forerunner of national Para sports,” he mentioned.
“Our progress is steady and these Para athletes have hinted that they can conquer international scene. All Para athletes who took part in Rio have bettered their performance with an impressive margin. Army has invested a lot in Para sports and we will provide them quality equipment and comprehensive training which are the key factors we have recognized in order to produce top international level athletes. What these athletes lacking are recognition and exposure, so I request all media to provide with due coverage to encourage these great people who have done a great job for the country,” Gunathilaka further added.
Gunathilaka thanked Dialog Asiata for strengthening Army Para Games for the second consecutive year as their main sponsor. “Dialog helped us on and off many times throughout the history and we hope they will support us in years to come,” Army Para Games Committee head stated.
Harsha Samaranayake, GM/Brand & Media, Dialog Asiata said that they are proud to support this important event and extended their support in future for the event. “We are really grateful for these injured heroes who did a great scarifies in bringing peace to this country. It is no secret that Dialog fosters many sports in Sri Lanka including the national cricket team. So we are wholeheartedly willing to support this annual event,” he mentioned.
