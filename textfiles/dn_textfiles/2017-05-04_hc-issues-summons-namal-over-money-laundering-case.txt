HC issues summons on Namal over money laundering case

The Colombo High Court yesterday issued summons on five persons, including Hambantota district Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa to appear before Court on June 6 for their alleged involvement in laundering money amounting to Rs.30 million through Gowers Corporate Services (Pvt) Limited in 2012.
Colombo High Court Judge Piyasena Ranasinghe made this order for the purpose of serving indictment against the accused on next calling date.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against Namal Rajapaksa, Indika Karunajeewa, Sujani Bogollagama, Iresha Silva and Senani Samaranayake under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act for their alleged involvement in money laundering amounting to Rs.30 million in a company (Gowers Corporate Services (Pvt) Limited) owned by Namal Rajapaksa. It was reported that Gowers Corporate Services (Pvt) Limited of Colombo 5, is providing coordinating services to Sri Lankan Airlines. The FCID had initiated investigations into this matter following a complaint by Voice Against Corruption Convener Wasantha Samarasinghe.
Samarasinghe alleged that MP Namal Rajapaksa had bought shares of a company named Hello Corp and set up a company called Gowers Corporate Services (Pvt) Limited while being an MP from the Rs.125 million earned through illegal means.
