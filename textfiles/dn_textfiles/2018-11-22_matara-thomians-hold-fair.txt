Matara Thomians hold fair

The Matara St. Thomas' College recently organised a fair titled 'Thomian Mela' to mark its 175th anniversary at the Sanath Jayasuriya Stadium. The fair will continue until November 25.
The event, organised by the school's junior old boys' association, consists of 30 education-related stalls, 100 trade stalls, as well as other exhibition stalls.
The fair's organising committee said that the funds collected through the event would be used to repair the parapet walls on the sides of the St. Thomas Mawatha, as well as the school's gates and buildings. A portion of it would also be used to help students in their co-curricular and extra-curricular activities.
