Reviewing policing practices

Transforming Police into a dynamic ‘Service’ - Part 1:
Though the practice of policing has existed in various forms throughout the history of Sri Lanka, it was the Dutch who first tasked their military with the responsibility of policing the City of Colombo. Later, in 1659, the Colombo Municipal Council adopted a resolution to appoint paid guards to protect the city by night. Thus, Sri Lanka Police have completed 150 years of service, as of 2016.
Keeping with the policies of Good Governance, the Minister of Law and Order and Southern Development, Minister Sagala Ratnayaka advised his officials to conduct a comprehensive research to find ways and means of introducing reforms for the Sri Lanka Police.
In the changing contemporary social landscape, especially in a post-war context, the Ministry of Law and Order and Southern Development (MLOSD) took steps to review current practices in policing in Sri Lanka with the aim of transforming the Sri Lanka Police force into a dynamic ‘police service’, in keeping with the principles of good governance, accountability and transparency.
In this context, the Ministry appointed a Policing Reforms Committee (PRC) in July 2016 to deliberate, and propose measures for introducing substantial reforms in policing in Sri Lanka. The PRC is chaired by the Secretary to the Ministry of Law and Order and Southern Development, and includes representatives from the Sri Lanka Police, the National Police Commission, academia and civil society. The Policing Reforms Committee has handed over the Sri Lanka Policing Reforms Action Plan to Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka, Minister of .
The objective of these reforms is to ensure that the resources available to the Sri Lanka Police are used in a manner that achieves the highest levels of efficiency and effectiveness in its operations, as measured by reference to the best policing standards of comparable police services around the world.
Research commissioned by the PRC
As part of the process of this project, three pieces of research were commissioned by the PRC to assist with their deliberations. This included an organizational analysis of the Sri Lanka Police by an expert committee, a survey among 1,200 police personnel at all ranks, and a community consultation among approximately 1,200 individuals across the island on police reform.
All three pieces of research centred around six thematic areas identified by the PRC,
which covered improving professionalism and standards, enhancing accountability and transparency, practising and upholding human rights, preventing crime, reducing the fear of crime and enhancing citizens’ sense of security, as well as increasing public trust and confidence.
In identifying and prioritising recommendations, the need to transform the Sri Lanka Police was highlighted as the eventual outcome to be achieved through the reforms process. Therefore, it is the view of the PRC that the design and implementation of all policing strategies should include an assessment of how these strategies will ensure that the rights of civilians are respected, while ensuring that the Sri Lanka Police treats its members fairly, with respect and dignity. This will be achieved by adopting a community policing centred approach.
The Sri Lanka Policing Reforms Action Plan 2017 includes key recommendations for policing reforms, which specify required actions, intended timelines for delivery and implementing bodies. The Reforms apply to all functional and territorial units of the Sri Lanka Police. It should be noted that as the reforms focus on policing more broadly and are not limited to police reforms, this action plan will include actions and support required from other key Ministries and key stakeholders to bring about effective transformation in policing in Sri Lanka.
A timeline for delivery is indicated for each recommendation and corresponding actions. ‘Immediate’ refers to actions that should begin forthwith once the action plan is approved; ‘Short term’ refers to actions that should be implemented within 1 year of approval; with ‘Medium term’ between 1 to 3 years, and ‘Long term’ referring to actions that should be completed within 5 years, at the latest.
Each Theme/Section of this Action Plan should be read together as complementing and contributing to achieving the overall vision to develop a professional police service that is accountable to citizens and the law, upholds good governance, and provides services effectively and impartially, to all.
The findings of the research revealed key factors that would serve as foundations or building blocks for effective implementation of the proposed policing reforms. Four aspects were identified as preconditions that would form the foundational basis for substantial reform.
Managing Strategic Change
Under ‘Managing Strategic Change’, the proposed reforms call for a significant shift in the approach to policing in Sri Lanka that will require the Sri Lanka Police to work closely with other Ministries and stakeholders.
This will involve reorienting the police force to adopt a community policing centred approach. In order to ensure a smooth transition, the Policing Reforms Committee identified the need to establish and invest in change management capacity within the Sri Lanka Police.
For monitoring the progress of the process, a policing reforms implementation and monitoring unit will be established within the Ministry of Law and Order and Southern Development.
This Unit will be headed by an Additional Secretary to the Ministry and will provide coordination and secretarial support to the Steering Committee as well as the Change Management Range located at the Sri Lanka Police. The Unit will translate the Policing Reforms Action Plan into Sinhala and Tamil, and will be responsible for implementing and designing external communications, under the oversight of the Steering Committee, and coordinate regular Monitoring and Evaluation of the Policing Reforms Action Plan.
Structural Reforms
As part of ‘Structural Reforms’, the research commissioned by the Policing Reforms Committee indicated the need for urgent organizational structural reform in the SLP. However, the PRC recognized that given the long history of the Sri Lanka Police, and the ongoing Constitutional Reform processes that could impact the form and structure of the Police, proposals for organizational structural reform would need further in-depth deliberations. Therefore, the PRC proposes that an Expert Working Group to Review the Police Structure is appointed in the short term to study existing research, studies, analysis regarding proposals for organizational structural reform, in collaboration with the National Police Commission and make recommendations on the most suitable structure to meet the objectives of the reform process, and study and analyse the rationale for deployment of police, and based on this study recommend alternate technology that would free police personnel from managing certain functions, for example in the Traffic Division.
The Expert Working Group will have representation from the Police Change Management Range and other government and civil society experts as necessary. Given the significance of this issue, the Chairperson of the Expert Working Group will be required to report regularly to the Steering Committee. Recommendations by the Expert Working Group should begin implementation within 3 years. The PRC notes that any reform to organizational structural change should be in line with the proposed Policing Reforms and the principle of accountability. Among the many aspects that will need to be reviewed with a view to improving efficiency and effectiveness, would be to review the rationale for current territorial and functional divisions including the Special Task Force (STF) and victim and witness protection etc; the deployment of resources and personnel geographically (to ensure that it is in line with population density and specific policing needs) and functionally (to reduce the time spent on non-core tasks, e.g. static security); and measures to address grievances among the ranks (by introducing specialization among Divisions, developing special interests for motivation purposes etc). It is further noted that re-structuring should go hand-in-hand with a personnel development plan for police officers who will be directly affected by change.
In terms of ‘Resources’, the issue of inadequate resources was highlighted as a major obstacle to effective policing in Sri Lanka. The community consultation highlighted the issue of late and inefficient police response to public complaints as a major obstacle to protecting human rights.
The public noted police attitude, lack of adequate personnel and lack of transport facilities or fuel, as a reason for delays. In the Police Survey, police officers indicated lack of transport (59 percent); lack of time to do normal work due to
extra duties (52 percent); lack of manpower (51 percent) and not being fluent in local languages (49 percent) as barriers to practising and upholding human rights.
Five key elements in reforming Sri Lanka Police
The committee has identified five key elements in reforming Sri Lanka Police and suggests recommendations for the ministry of Law and Order and Southern Development.
This section makes specific recommendations related to physical and material resources, while the issue of personnel or human resources is deliberated under the Section on Improving Professional Standards. The PRC believes in terms of resources, the principal aim should be to improve the quality of policing, and not merely increasing the quantity of resources at police stations.
Based on these issues, the PRC’s recommendations includes strengthening the financial management system as the main recommendation, in addition to reviewing current financial management systems, including the budgeting and allocations procedure, focusing on cost efficiencies, assess spending decisions against strategic priorities. Improving resources and infrastructure is another recommendation.
Reviewing layout of police stations based on a model developed by the University of Moratuwa to ensure people-friendly police stations afford greater transparency, and secures the dignity of complainants as well as suspects, and provides access for the disabled.
In light of the above, it was decided to review the impact on the ongoing building programme for new police stations. This would include a costing of what it would take to influence design and layout of all new buildings and consider how existing stations would be altered over time, to ensure women and child friendly spaces within police stations, in addition to ensuring greater alignment with objectives of the Policing Reforms.
Investing in Data and Digital Infrastructure to build up the technological capabilities of the SLP at Aggregate and Functional and Territorial Level, digitalizing complaints and linking with ongoing review of the police communication system, were also recommended.
Deliberations on policing reforms highlighted the need for amendments to the Police Ordinance, in keeping with the priorities of the Policing Reforms. It was suggested that these amendments are developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders. The PRC Sub-Committee on legal reforms considered the need to either amend the existing Police Ordinance or draft new laws, and took an informed decision to wait for greater clarity on Constitutional Reforms.
Police officers were invited to submit their views on proposed amendments to the Police Ordinance. Twenty-four proposals were received after consulting OICs and other police officers. The PRC believes that the concept of community policing should be integrated into the new Policing Act or any amendments to the Police Ordinance.
The committee has identified five key elements in reforming Sri Lanka Police and suggested recommendations for the Ministry of Law and Order and Southern Development.
First among these is the ‘Improving Professional Standards’. The public in the community consultations expressed appreciation of the Sri Lanka Police and recognised the role the police play in maintaining security, law and order. However, a key finding of the research that was commissioned by the PRC revealed the need to work towards a courteous, respectful police service that upholds the rule of law and maintains a good relationship with the public.
Quality of recruitment, transfer and promotion systems
Central to professional standards were issues related to quality of recruitment, transfer and promotion systems, the need for clear job descriptions and effective training. Only 44 percent of police officers indicated having ‘full clarity’ regarding expectations of them at work. This mirrored the findings of the community consultation which stated that police should have clear ‘duty lists’ to enable police officers to be informed of their daily duties. Additionally, the Police Survey revealed that only 22 percent of officers reported continuous and regular feedback from superiors, with 66 percent indicating they received feedback occasionally during appraisal.
Furthermore, despite approximately 83,000 police officers, the community consultation on Police Reforms pointed to the lack of adequate police officers in certain locations as a reason for lack of effective and swift police response. The organisational analysis found that the workforce was largely immobile with police officers reluctant to relocate. Certain locations had larger deployments than can be justified.
In order to ‘Enhance Recruitment’ it was recommended that a Commission be appointed to study under-representation of particular groups within the police, including demographic, geographic, representation to identify barriers and make recommendations to increase representation and diversity. Include a study on the police cadetting system, particularly regarding recruiting the calibre of youth needed for the police service in the future.
Commission a study on under-representation of particular groups within the police, including demographic, geographic, representation to identify barriers and make recommendations to increase representation and diversity. Include a study on the police cadetting system, particularly regarding recruiting the calibre of youth needed for the police service in the future.
