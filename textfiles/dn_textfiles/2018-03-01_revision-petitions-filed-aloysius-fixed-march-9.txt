Revision petitions filed by Aloysius fixed for March 9

A revision application filed by Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius and its CEO Kasun Palisena, arrested and remanded in connection with the controversial Central Bank Bond issuance, was yesterday fixed for March 9 by the Colombo High Court.
High Court Judge Sampath Wijeratne informed that the order regarding whether notice should be issued on respondents in respect of the revision petition, would be announced on March 9.
Through this revision application, Aloysius and Palisena sought an order against the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court’s refusal to grant bail on February 16. The petitioner is also seeking an order to release him on bail.
On February 16, Arjun Aloysius and PTL Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena were ordered to be further remanded till March 2 by the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court.
In this application, the petitioner had cited the OIC of CID (Unit 3), the Director of CID and the Attorney General as respondents. Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne refused to release the two suspects on bail citing that the reasons given by the defence were not sufficient to consider releasing the suspects on bail under exceptional circumstances since they had been charged under the Public Property Act.
The suspects have been charged under the Public Property Act, Penal Code, Registered Stocks and Securities Ordinance and Code of Conduct for Primary Dealers for illegal insider trading.
President’s Counsel Gamini Marapana with Counsel Navin Marapana under the instructions of Sanath Wijewardena appeared for the petitioners.
