Sasitharan to form new political party

She participated in the UN Human Rights Council session and levelled allegations against the Sri Lankan government for commiting war crimes during the final stages of the war. The Tamil National Alliance had taken disciplinary action against her and annulled her party membership as she had gone to Geneva without obtaining permission from the party.
However, Northern Province Chief Minister C.V.Vigneshwaran supported her. She has now decided to form a new political under the name of “Thamilar Suyaadsikkazagam” that means (Tamils Self Governing Party).
