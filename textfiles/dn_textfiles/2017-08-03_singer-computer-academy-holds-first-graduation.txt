“The purpose of technology is not to confuse the brain but to serve the body”- William S. Burroughs
The Singer Computer Academy, among the main academies of Singer Business School, backed by Sri Lanka's most diversified company-the Singer Group, held its inaugural graduation recently.
Students who completed their ‘Skills Proficiency Awards in Basic IT for Office Applications’ received the Skills Proficiency Certificate.
This foundation course helps participants’ master basic ICT skills and is in partnership with internationally acclaimed City and Guilds of London Institute (City & Guilds).
The Computer Academy leverages Singer's heritage built over 164 years and its unmatched reach, and City & Guilds reputation as pioneers in global skills development creating a synergy which underscores the qualitative offering of this programme. The structured course content includes an introduction to computers, Microsoft Office applications and use of internet and email. A distinctive module in the course is the inclusion of safety and health advice when working with computers. The overall certification competencies are designed to help students acquire gainful employment.
Students are presented with a Guide Book of the detailed syllabusand receive individual attention and unlimited time for practical to develop their skills.
Additionally, a notable feature of this programme is where students have the opportunity to follow this course in their own hometowns. Students no longer have to come to Colombo to receive an ICT education saving valuable time and finances. Currently Singer Computer Academies are located in Kiribathgoda, Embilipitiya, Wennapuwa, Badulla, Wellawaya, Dickwella, Pilimathalawa and Anuradhapura.
