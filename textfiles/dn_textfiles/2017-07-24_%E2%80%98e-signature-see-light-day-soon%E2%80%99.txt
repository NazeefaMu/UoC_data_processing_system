‘E signature to see light of day soon’

The much awaited and the long overdue E signature for Custom clearing and container scanning would be up and running by the end of the year assured the Director General of Sri Lanka Customs, Chulananda De Silva.
Speaking at the 82nd Annual General meeting of the Import Sector of Ceylon Chamber of Commerce he said that it was some last minute legislature that held these two back.
The director general said he was very pleased to finally be able to launch the online payment platform last week and this would enable the department to move soon to a paperless clearing process soon. He however said he is yet to create a good, polite and pleasant working culture at the Customs Department for the customers and he is working towards this as well.
Outgoing Chairman, Dinesh de Silva said that the Chamber was fighting with the authorities for a long time to create a conducive environment for the private sector in the industry mainly in two areas.
“Firstly, to have the proper required legislation in place to suit the modern day business like the enactment of the new Customs Law, Import and Export Control Act, Exchange Control Act, Sri Lanka Ports Authority Act and the full implementation of the Electronic Transaction Act. Secondly, we want to maintain consistency in all International Trade related polices which will build confidence and predictability in making business decisions and operations”.
With these two main enablers the country’s international trade will grow beyond doubt. These initiatives will directly help Sri Lanka’s global ranking in terms of business efficiency and Ease of Doing Business Index. This needs urgent attentions by the authorities as Sri Lanka needs to move up from the low ranking.
Currently in Ease of Doing Business Ranking among 190 economies in from being in the 85th position in 2013, the position has deteriorated to, in 2014-113, in 2015-109 and in 2016 to 110th position losing 25 places in the process, he cautioned.
Between 2014 and 2016, the country’s global ranking in terms of business efficiency, transparency of border administration, measured by the Global Trade Enabling Index, went down by 10 places from 87th to 97th out of 136 countries. Sri Lanka lags behind Thailand (44th) India (75th) and Vietnam (86th).
In Doing Business Index 2017 of the World Bank, it takes 76 hours on average to comply with export documentary requirements in Sri Lanka compared to 11 hours in Thailand, 38 hours in India and 50 hours in Vietnam.
Meanwhile the incoming Chairman of Import Section, Nishan Nanayakkara urged the government to expedite some of the long outstanding bottlenecks enabling the trade to benefit in terms of cost saving and time. “We must also thank authorities for launching the on-line payment platform to felicitate real time payment to customers.
“In addition involvement in the Trade Facilitation Agreements and the drafting of the new customs ordinance, addressing the negative impact on the local industry with the proposed tariff liberalization through FTAs, taking up concerns of the industry with the authorities at the highest level against arbitrary charges that affect the trade including attempts to re-introduce THC by parties with vested interests, will be a few of the focused areas of the import section in future,” he added.
