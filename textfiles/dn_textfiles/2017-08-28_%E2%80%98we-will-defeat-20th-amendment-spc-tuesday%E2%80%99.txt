‘We will defeat 20th Amendment at SPC on Tuesday’

The resolution on 20th Amendment to the Constitution to be presented at the Southern Provincial Council special meeting on Tuesday would be defeated, Galle District Joint Opposition Councilor Chamly Withanachchi said.
"Guided by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, we will defeat the Act as it goes against the Constitution. The Joint Opposition enjoys the majority in the council. We met the former President and discussed over the issue in Colombo. We demand the authorities to hold the Provincial Council election soon. The act curtails some powers of Chief Ministers," he said.
SP Chief Government Whip Ajith Rajapaksa said the proposed act was to be submitted at the previous council meeting held on August 22, but it was not.
"When we inquired about it from the secretary, he said they had not received the 20th Amendment Bill at that time. Therefore, a written request was made from the Chairman with signatures of 27 councillors to convene a special meeting on August 29.
Opposition Leader of the Council Tennakoon Nilame assured that they would support the Amendment. "We support the move. It will minimize numerous election related frauds and malpractices. We plan to discuss the issue at our party members meeting before we take part in the debate," he said. Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal De Silva said they had not officially received a copy of the draft bill and would take a decision according to the instructions of the party leadership.
