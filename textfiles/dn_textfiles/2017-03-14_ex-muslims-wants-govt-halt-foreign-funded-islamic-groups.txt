Ex-Muslims wants govt to halt foreign-funded Islamic groups

The Ex-Muslims of Sri Lanka (EMSL) organisation said it wants the government to bring to an end all activities carried out by foreign-funded Islamic groups, organisations, individuals and related elements in Sri Lanka.
According to EMSL sources, the foreign-funded Islamic groups have links with the Islamic terrorist group, ISIS. They have become a threat to the existence of ex-Muslims in Kattankudy, the organisation said.
“They are causing a crisis of faith for Muslims. Some of them have started teaching their doctrine of fundamentalism,” an EMSL member said.
He said: “There are factions of radical Islamic groups in Kattankudy who are supporting the ISIS, upholding their terrorist ideology. They have also undertaken to play the ISIS advocate role.”
“The incident that took place between two Mulim factions on March 10 in Kattankudy, indicates that extremist groups are ready to spread their terror,”he said.
