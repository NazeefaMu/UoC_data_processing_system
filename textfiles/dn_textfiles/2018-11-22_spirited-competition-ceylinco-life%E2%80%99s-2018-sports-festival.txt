Spirited competition at Ceylinco Life’s 2018 Sports Festival

Life insurance promoters demonstrated their skills in sports when the 12th annual sports festival of Ceylinco Life concluded recently at the Mahinda Rajapaksa International Stadium in Diyagama, Homagama.
The track and field events of the festival were worked out at the stadium after the life insurance leader’s cricket, volleyball and netball tournaments were completed a few days before the main event.
Ceylinco Life staff and sales teams from every district of Sri Lanka competed for track and field honours in eight groups at the event.
Ceylinco Life Managing Director and CEO R. Renganathan was the chief guest and the meet was declared open by the Company’s Director and Deputy CEO Thushara Ranasinghe.
The competition list included 100m, 200m, 400m, 800m and 1500m races for men and women, 100x4 and 400x4 relays, a 800m walking race, high jump, long jump, shot put, discus throw as well as a tug-o-war and a 100x4 relay for heads of branches.
At the end of a day of spirited competition, the ‘TV’ group emerged champions for 2018. Teams from the ‘JJ’ group repeated their achievements of last year, winning the volleyball and the netball tournaments, while the ‘WW’ and ‘PB’ groups won the Men’s and the Women’s cricket tournaments respectively.
