Authorities instructed to expedite work at Kalametiya harbour

Authorities were instructed to complete the construction work of the Kalametiya fisheries harbour within two months, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development State Minister Dilip Wedaarachchi said.
He was addressing the fishing community at Tangalle, recently.
He said a tug o’ war between the company involved in the construction work and the consultancy firm had delayed the work. He said this would create a bad impression in the fishing community that the government is not focusing on completing it.
The State Minister added that the fishing community is facing many difficulties due to the delay and losing their income.
He said certain officials who bear different political views are attempting to hamper development activities to bring disrepute to the government. The State Minister added that the government has implemented development activities to cover all districts by changing the previous government’s lopsided system of development which was restricted to a few districts.
