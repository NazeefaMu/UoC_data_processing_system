Faith in human resources

According to the government’s economic policy statement issued recently and related speeches made by PM and others, Lanka envisions achieving environment friendly sustainable development while linking the country to global supply chains and increasing trade. The government hopes to create more exposure and opportunities for entrepreneurs and skilled professionals in various sectors, including the digital economy, tourism and commercial agriculture and to attain the status of a modern manufacturing economy. However all this should be done with the responsibility towards damaging and wasting of ecological resources.
In addition, social and economic rights of humans should be protected. In this context, quality higher education and training are crucial if the Lankan economy is to move up the value chain, beyond the simple production processes and delivering products.
Lanka’s human capital is the essential primary resource in achieving the envisaged development goals and transforming the economy into a modern manufacturing system with relevant social responsibility. Thus, it became important for the country to be equipped with new technological innovations oriented and an educated workforce with such skills. High-quality human resources with expertise in science and technology and a skilled labour force are necessary, especially conscious of environment and eco friendly to compete globally. Even lower-skilled jobs increasingly require talent and knowledge.
Vocational training and secondary education
As such, vocational training and secondary education need to prepare prospective employees for a complex, digital work in an environment friendly background. Today, Lanka faces a major challenge in catering to these emerging skill requirements. It is necessary to explore some policy options to bridge the skill gaps to achieve the government’s stated objectives.
With the environment consciousness and human social rights awareness, one has to look at World Bank proposals. World Bank study on ‘Building the Skills for Economic Growth and Competitiveness in Sri Lanka’ based on a survey of employers’ perception of skill demand against the skills available in the workforce reveals 56 percent of employers consider that high-skilled workers should have passed A/Levels, while 70 percent of employers consider that low-skilled workers should have passed O/Levels. But the real situation is, of the age 20 and above population, only 17 percent have passed A/Levels and another 17 percent have passed O/Levels (calculations based on LFS 2014 data). This means that there is a significant gap in meeting the skills demand. In addition social and ecological consciousness should be taken into account. Today there is a rapidly growing demand for soft skills–especially English literacy and IT prowess. Individuals competent in English have access to better quality jobs with higher salaries and benefits in the domestic labour market, as well as internationally. Also they easily enter into the discussions and seminars in the open society. The study mentioned above reveals that about 80 percent of employers expect higher-skilled workers to know English and 40 percent employers expect similar soft skills from less-skilled workers.
Higher-skilled workers
Similarly, 75 percent of employers expect higher-skilled workers to possess computer skills and 38 percent of employers expect similar soft skills from lower-skilled workers. However, calculations based on the Census of Population and Housing show that, of the age 15 and above population, knowledge in English literacy has not reached that level. Hence more resources should be allocated to improve this ability (ability to speak, read and write) and computer literacy.
While Lankan bourgeoisie is looking towards the west for modernization world got shocked when President Trump announced the United States would withdraw from the Paris Climate agreement. This virtually coincided with the Global Foot print Network (GFN) announcement that Earth Overshoot Day 2017 will fall on August 2.
That means, from January 1 to August 2, the world’s 7.5 billion people will have used as much of Earth’s biological resources—or biocapacity—as the planet can regenerate in a year. During the remaining five months of 2017, our human consumption will be drawing down Earth’s reserves of fresh water, fertile soils, forests, and fisheries, and depleting its ability to regenerate these resources as well as sequester excess carbon released into the atmosphere.
In other words, humans are depleting living Earth’s capacity to support life. With the GFN methodology one can also generate an ecological footprint for individual cities, states, and nations, based on the burden each generates relative to its local biocapacity. It can also compare a personal footprint generated by a distinctive lifestyle to both national and global averages. The U.S. and developed countries claim that they have relatively abundant per capita biocapacity compared to most developing nations. However US are one of the world’s highest per capita consumers. Consequently, the net outcome is a total national biocapacity deficit second only to that of China—a country with a population roughly four times that of US. Knowing that, collectively, the world is consuming far more than the planet can sustain, how do we bring ourselves into balance with Earth’s capacities?
According to western authorities there are four critical global priorities, firstly Decarbonisation. Humanity’s carbon energy use accounts for 60 percent of the global ecological footprint. By GFN’s estimate, “Reducing the carbon component of the global Ecological Footprint by 50 percent would get us from consuming the resources of 1.7 Earths down to 1.2 Earths, or move the date of Overshoot Day forward by 89 days, or about three months.” Accordingly that would place Overshoot Day on October 30.
Secondly they say population control. “We cannot ignore population growth if we are truly committed to people having secure lives in a world of finite resources,” noted Susan Burns, GFN co-founder. She urges empowering women and assuring that every child is wanted. This is highly debatable question. In Lanka recently doctor that persuaded this policy was arrested by the police. Racial suspicions can grow over this issue. However by GFN’s analysis, reducing the current global average family size by half a child would push back Overshoot D by 31 days.
Gross domestic product
Thirdly they say food production should cover total consumption. By GFN’s calculation, sourcing food locally, avoiding highly processed foods, reducing meat consumption, and cutting food waste by half could move Overshoot Day forward by 11 days. This does not challenge the expectations of third world countries. Lastly they say improvement in urban built environments could help the balancing. GFN estimates that increasing the energy efficiency of the urban built environment through measures such as efficient mass transit could advance Overshoot Day by 2 days.
If all four of these priorities are achieved, they say, humans could bring overshoot Day to December 13 and almost be in balance with Earth’s capacity to sustain all of us. There is considerable truth to the saying that one can manage only what one measures. Measure the wrong thing, and the consequences can be catastrophic. Unfortunately, governments currently invest heavily in reporting financial indicators, such as gross domestic product, that tell the masses little either about actual human well-being or long-term viability on Earth. In measuring the right things, one could say that GFN shatters the illusions of such measures and analyses. Still, one needs a clearer and more complete and coherent reporting and analysis of the global footprint measurements than the GFN offers.
The responsibility for such statistical gathering and reporting should fall, not to small non-profit social organisations, but rather to the United Nations and the statistical services of the world’s national governments. Producing detailed global footprint measurements, reporting, and analysis should be among the top priorities of such official agencies. That will be a far greater contribution to national and global well-being than the grossly misleading economic indicators to which they now devote the bulk of their resources. This situation can arise if the United Nations becomes a properly organised democratic world government.
