Online system for health care programme applications

The Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Ministry has introduced an online system for the submission of applications for training programmes conducted for health care professionals in order to accelerate the recruitment process.
The Gazette notification will be issued tomorrow (31) for the recruitment of trainees for 12 training programmes including nurses, paramedics etc.
Addressing the media at the Government Information Department yesterday, Deputy Director General (Education, Training and Research) of the Health Ministry Dr. Sunil de Alwis said that according to the previous system, it took around one and a half years to complete the recruitment process, but under the new system, it will take around two to three months to complete the process.
“Since the online system has been introduced for the first time this year, we have decided to accept the applications under the new online system as well as those forwarded under the previous system,” he said.
Health Ministry Human Resources Director Dr. Dilith de Silva said the online system is not a new concept for applicants since it has the same features of the online system introduced four or five years ago by the UGC for the submission of applications for university admissions. The IT Department of the Moratuwa University is the technical partner of both institutions.
“According to the software developed with the assistance of the Moratuwa University, we can check the Advanced Level Examination results of the applicants within a few seconds since their NIC number and index number are linked to the Department of Examinations. Earlier, we had to wait for months to verify these results,” he added.
Earlier, the Health Ministry issued two Gazette notifications with regard to the recruitment of Pupil Nurses and Paramedical trainees. This year, one Gazette notification will be issued for the recruitment of trainees for 12 training programmes and it will be issued on August 31.
