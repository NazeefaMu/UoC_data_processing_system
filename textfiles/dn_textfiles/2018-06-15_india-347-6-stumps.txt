India 347-6 at stumps

Bangalore, Thursday: Centuries from Shikhar Dhawan and Murali Vijay helped India reach 347 for six at stumps on a rain-hit opening day of Afghanistan’s debut Test in Bangalore on Thursday.
Test cricket’s newest team were on the receiving end of some aggressive batting as Dhawan, who smashed 107, and Vijay, who made 105, put on a 168-run opening stand after the hosts elected to bat first. But Afghanistan’s bowlers struck back in the final session. Fast bowler Yamin Ahmadzai, who got his team’s first Test scalp after getting Dhawan, took two wickets. Fellow paceman Wafadar, spin sensation Rashid Khan and Mujeeb Ur Rahman picked up a wicket each.
Hardik Pandya, on 10, and Ravichandran Ashwin, on 7, were at the crease when play ended after an extended final session but only 78 overs were possible due to two rain interruptions. AFP
