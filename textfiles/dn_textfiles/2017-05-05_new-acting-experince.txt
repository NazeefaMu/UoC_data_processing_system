A new acting experince!

Drama at AIS encapsulates the vigor of youth and its exuberance. Dramatic Moves features Asian International School, a school that has proved its mettle turning out some quality productions over the years.
“We don’t have a drama club as such, but we do regular productions for public performances every two to three years. We function as the Senior English Literary Association. We do a big public production every two to three years. We also have inter-house drama competitions, whenever we don’t have the big production,” said Co teacher in charge, Sandra Gomes.
A resounding success
AIS students are highly skilled. They only need a good director to steer them in the right way and they have had the services of Jerome De Silva, a director second to none.
“We usually do musicals for our school public performances with a big cast. The last public performance we did was “The Wiz”, last month, directed by Jerome De Silva. The one in 2014 was ‘Annie’, also directed by Jerome,” stated Gomes.
Gomes was also quick to point out that when it comes to drama the talent at AIS is very big.
“The kids are very enthusiastic and very capable. Wiz was a resounding success. The acting was superb. We had a good director. It all turned out to be exceptionally good. We had 90 students taking part in ‘The Wiz’. Our oldest student was 16 and the youngest was 9. One of our students, Joshua Weerasingham, who took part in the Wiz, also took part in the ‘Tempest’ (April 1 & 2) and ‘Macbeth’ (March 25 & 26) done by the Workshop Players. He was in last years, ‘Midsummer Nights’ Dream as well,” explained Gomes.
Gomes pointed out that they did another big production in 2007 – Joseph and the amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.
“It is important for a student to do drama. It teaches them confidence and public speaking skills and it teaches them how to get along with other children. It teaches them team work and to think creatively,” pointed out Gomes.
Gomes also felt that because the children have other commitments and school activities, the biggest obstacle is to find a regular time that they can all attend. “But the parents are all very supportive. Sometimes practices go till very late. The parents have to make a lot of sacrifices, but they do it,” said Gomes.
The students do a lot on their own. The students help in everything. “We get outside people to direct them but keeping in mind that it is not feasible unless it is fun. However we have done some pretty controversial things for our inter-house competitions, but not for public performances, where we have little kids taking part. Our inter-house competitions are very intense. The competition between the four houses is very intense. They don’t spend a lot of time doing it. They spend about two to three weeks of intense practice and the come up with very good performances. We usually pick on playwright and do four plays from one playwright. It is very interesting working with these kids,” pointed out Gomes.
A strong foundation
Shannon Wannakuwatte, the other co-teacher in charge emphasized that this experience in drama is unlike anything else.
“They are all from a range of ages, and more than anything, it fosters a sense of friendship and a feeling of togetherness, because you are meeting in a way that is different to the usual school settings. Sandra and I have a very different relationship with these bunch of kids who have acted. We like to think we are a little closer to them because we have had three or four months together with them. In drama you have a safe place you can call home with a bunch of people,” said Wannakuwatte.
Wannakuwatte mentioned that working with these kids is lovely. “They always pull through and it is a very rewarding experience working with them because as a teacher it is always rewarding to see your hard work bearing fruition.
‘The Wiz’ was huge for us. It was the biggest cast we have worked with and it was massive. The kids worked together and gelled so well and it was lovely. We don’t have a drama club per say, we are members of the Senior English Literary Association, which kind of branches out and organizes these things – sometimes drama and sometimes debating,” pointed out Wannakuwatte.
Wannakuwatte spoke about how enthusiastic the cast is, being a young one at that. “We have quite a bunch of enthusiastic kids who are talented. They just need some guidance. But I am quite sure that the ones who will be coming in for drama in the future will make fabulous casts for years to come.”
Wannakuwatte reflected on the fact that AIS have a strong foundation for musicals. “Ishan De Lanerolle is our choir director and musicals allow a big cast. When it comes to Inter-House, the competition is really high and the standard of the plays are really high. We do a lot of musicals because we have a lot of good singers.”
Really fun
Shyalina Muthumudalige, a cast member of ‘The Wiz’, recalls that her role in that production was certainly memorable. “Taking part in ‘The Wiz’ was really great. I met a lot of people and it was a very fun experience. Because as we all know productions bring people together. Drama is a big part of my life. I have been acting for a long time and it is home.
Taking part in ‘Annie’, was really fun. It was the second production I had taken part in and my first with Jerome De Silva. It was a little scary but it was really fun to work with a large cast and people my own age. The production I took part in before had mainly adults
It is interesting to see the world through the eyes of different people and characters. I have always had a passion for drama,” said Muthumudalige.
A really big impact
Joshua Weerasingham, is a junior workshop player in addition to being a student at AIS.
“It was new [acting in Workshop player productions]. I met new people. But it is also very similar because they are like these people [AIS students]. Drama has had a really big impact upon my life. This is because I started when I was really small. Since then I have been really hooked on to it. Doing ‘Shakespeare in the Park’ was a new experience since it was done outdoors and the audience is all around you.
When it comes to AIS, the talent is really big. We have small kids who are very good at dancing. And then you have the seniors and when you put them all together you get a really good result. I think from the moment I started, I realized I had a passion for it, stepping into the shoes of a character and bringing that character to life,” said Weerasingham
Multi-tasking
Nethmi Gunasekara, another member of ‘The Wiz’spoke about being able to develop new abilities through drama.
“Doing ‘The Wiz’ was a new acting experience, because I had not done acting much. It was new and exciting and it was also scary. I met a lot of people and we are now very much a family. Balancing school work and drama was hard and I was facing my O/Ls but I got through somehow and in doing so learnt multi-tasking in the process,” said Gunasekara.
The group unanimously agreed that they had received a lot of good reviews and that a lot of people had very nice things to say about their productions. But there were also critiques on how they can improve which is ultimately all good, since it helps them to get better.
