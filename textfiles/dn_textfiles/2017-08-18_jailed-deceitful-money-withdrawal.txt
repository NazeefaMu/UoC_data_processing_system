Jailed for deceitful money withdrawal

Galle Magistrate Nishantha Peiris imprisoned a woman for 36 months as she was found guilty of deceitfully withdrawing money from a bank account using fake documents and impersonating the real account holder.
She was prosecuted on nine counts and was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment for each of the first six counts.
Furthermore, she was fined Rs. 1,500 for each of the remaining four counts with a compensation of Rs. 2,500 to be paid to the plaintiff. In case of nonpayment of the fine, she was subjected to further six months’ imprisonment.
The suspect was charged for illegally withdrawing Rs. 393,000 from a bank account using fraudulent documents and impersonating the real account holder on September 24, 2007.
A garment employee had maintained a fixed deposit in a State bank in Galle city and on maturity of the fixed deposit, she had gone to the bank to withdraw money when she was informed by the bank officials that the money in her fixed deposit account had been withdrawn.
