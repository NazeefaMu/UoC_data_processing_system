Scan Jumbo Peanuts concludes Scan Jumbo Bonanza

xFollowing the tremendous success of the Scan Jumbo Peanut Cycle Wassa promotion over the past three years, the Scan Products Division of C.W. Mackie PLC decided to go a step further by introducing the Scan Jumbo Bonanza Consumer Promotion.
The promotion offered a home theatre system to each of the 50 lucky winners. The home theatre consisted of a LG television, DVD player and a 5.1 ft. tall surround sound speaker system. The Scan Jumbo Bonanza Competition was launched on July 21 2017 and ended on September 25 within a duration of 67 days, covering 120 towns across the island.
Scan Products, the FMCG arm of the diversified C.W. Mackie PLC group of companies, disclosed that the main reason for the continuation of these types of promotions was to reward loyal customers who have enjoyed Scan Jumbo Peanuts over the years and to thank them for patronizing the brand.
To participate in the competition, a customer was required to send an empty wrapper of Scan Jumbo Peanuts with his/her details (name, address, ID number and contact number) to P.O. Box 161, Colombo.
Scan Jumbo Peanut is the category leader in its particular category enjoying 70% market share. Packed under the label of “Scan”, the peanuts are carefully chosen based on the correct size, and processed and packed in strict hygienic conditions. Scan is another proprietary brand that enjoys a high level of popularity among consumers irrespective of age.
