Chord with the right touch

It was an evening of pure enjoyment. It was an evening that saw some stunning performances from the soothing sounds of the 'Three Guitars (Athraja De Silva, Praveen Jayaweera and Thaksala) to the powerful rock of Andrew Obeysekara of Stigmata.
Guitar Fest 2016 saw a spectrum of guitarists, each with his or her different and varying styles. This Sixth festival of Guitar Music was held from January 24 - 27 at Colombo, Kurunegala (25), Jaffna (26) and Rajarata University in Mihintale (27).
Guitarist from those localities gathered together to give some superlative performances under the theme of uniting all people through music. This is a completely voluntary effort by the artists with no pay.
The festival will continue in the future so that young artistes can discover and display their talents alongside other artistes and thrill and regale crowds with some wonderful music. That is the purpose of the festival - to celebrate music and celebrate our diversity.
The Daily News visited Royal College Nawa Rangahala on January 24 and tasted the resounding success of the evening which saw a house full.
The fact that there was an abundance of young talent was evident starting first with the Three Guitars, a trio that was very melodic and mellow.
Vngrumso Raman from India struck a chord with the audience by his evocative music that stood out with his inimitable charm and grace.
Ken Gonzo Sugamata of Japan was the other extreme. His performance really went down well with the crowd. He was at once humorous and playful with the audience. His playfulness however does not indicate that he is a mere windbag. His music really was first class.
Andrew Obeysekara of Stimata was undoubtedly the best part of the evening. The raw energy and power he displayed was incredible. Of course it is no surprise that his performance was so brilliant. Obeysekara of Stigmata fame is well known to Colombo crowds because of the overwhelming success of the rock group Stimata. Obeysekara's abilities have been forged by so many performances on the stage.
The North Indian Raga Music was performed by Nimal Jayakody, who played the Sarodh was accompanied by K. Thilakaratne on Tabla. This was a very special performance because the Sarodh is categorized as a rare musical instrument. It is popular in Indian music and it has its origins in Afghanistan and Central Asia. The meaning of Sarodh is 'beautiful sound'.
"I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome our Director of the Indian Cultural Center, Rajashree Behera who is present here. In her capacity she helped us to have an American Classical Guitarist to come to Sri Lanka and perform," said Mohomed Iqbal of the Organizing Committee.
One performance that cannot be ignored was Anslem Fernando on the harp and Ravi Perera on Key board. They performed their first number - the Latin American song 'Paharo Campana' followed by a composition of their own called 'Ocean Waves'.
"At one of the workshops I met Anslem Fernando. He came to the workshop and told me he was keen on promoting the musical instrument the harp," said Iqbal.
The Daily News also managed to chat with Andrew Obeysekara who really energized the evening.
"I have been honored to have been a part of Guitar Fest for the last six years from its inception and I was invited by Iqbal back in 2011. So since then I have been encouraging and being a part of the guitar association in taking the guitar music to the public. My performance today was a bit of a spontaneous one and I enjoyed it. I am really happy that it has expanded to three other cities," said Andrew Obeysekara.
Andrew who also delivered the vote of thanks paid tribute to the many people who worked so hard day and night to make the festival a success.
"I must thank Chief Minister Isuru Devapriya for accepting our invitation and being present here. I also thank Cuban Ambassador Florentino Batista. I also wish to acknowledge the Indian Cultural Center Director, Rajashree Behera, who has helped us to develop classical guitar music in co-operation with the Guitar societies in India. A special word of thanks to Department of Cultural Affairs Director Anusha Gokula Fernando. It is her word of encouragement and support in organizing transport to all cities. I must also thank National Unity and Reconciliation Director Chandrasena Maliyadde for being present here and giving a valuable contribution to this festival in Colombo, Jaffna, Kurunegala and Mihintale. A special word of thanks to Ken Gonzo Sugamata who is a true friend of the Guitar Association. He came down in 2013 and 2015 and we wish to see him again next year and future events. All musicians have come here to perform without any payment. And let's keep it this way so guitar music reaches all walks of people! "
No doubt crowds that visit Guitar Fest 2016 will return again to enjoy some world class music and with many memories of an evening which was so very worthwhile.
