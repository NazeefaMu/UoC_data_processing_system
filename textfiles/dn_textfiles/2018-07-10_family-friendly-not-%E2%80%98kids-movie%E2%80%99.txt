The Incredibles 2
Family-friendly, but not a ‘kids movie’

Like the first film, ‘The Incredibles 2’ defies the genre of ‘kids movie.’ Writer and creator of ‘The Incredibles’ franchise, Brad Bird, recently addressed parents who criticised ‘The Incredibles 2’ on Twitter. Parents said the film used mature language and bored at least one four-year-old viewer.
In response, Bird Tweeted: “With all due respect, it is NOT a ‘kids movie’. It is animated, and rated PG.”
While both Incredibles movies are family-friendly, neither is written for children, hence its mass-appeal. In fact, general audiences account for 57 percent of viewers, while parents and children represent 12 percent and 31 percent. ‘The Incredibles 2’ has already surpassed the box office earnings of its predecessor worldwide (even with inflation), raking in almost $650 million USD.
14 years later, ‘The Incredibles 2’ picks up exactly where ‘The Incredibles’ left off, as the family splits up in pursuit of The Underminer. ‘The Incredibles’ manage to stop The Underminer’s rogue drill, but not before it destroys large parts of the city. Police swarm the superheroes and blame them for the destruction.
“If you’d simply deferred to the procedures in place!” yells one officer, referring to the bank’s insurance plan. “You’d rather we do nothing?” asks Mr. Incredible. “Yes,” he replies.
In a world where Supers are illegal, the Incredibles are reprimanded for not cowing down to the rules, “even if,” as Mr. Incredible (aka Bob Parr) says, “those rules are unfair.” Agent Dicker of the NSA (National Superpowers Agency) states the problem in different terms: “Politicians don’t understand people who do good just because it’s right. They’ve been gunning for Supers for years.”
Underlying the world of ‘The Incredibles’ are larger conversations about governance in the U.S. Supers represent an imagined past uncomplicated by government systems; this is partly what gives Supers their appeal. In The Incredibles 2, as Elastagirl drives through a crowd of her adoring fans, the radio in the car says, “When it comes to decision-making, people have more faith in a monkey throwing darts than Congress.” Whereas a Super can make quick decisions with clear goals in mind, the government’s slow and ungainly progress tends to lose public confidence.
‘The Incredibles 2’ centres on Elastagirl’s work at Devtech, attempting to legalise Supers. Devtech televises Elastagirl’s heroic deeds, in order to give people ‘perspective,’ and gain public support.
Unknown to Elastagirl, the villain ScreenSlaver is actually a fabrication of Evelyn Devtech, who hypnotises people through screens. Eventually, Elastagirl gets hypnotised by Evelyn in a scheme to make Supers illegal forever. Evelyn’s bitterness stems from the belief that her father died because he relied too much on Supers. “Supers keep us weak,” she says.
Another continuing theme in ‘The Incredibles 2’ is a distrust of wealthy tech companies that offer seductive, expedient solutions. It’s no coincidence that in both films tech companies offer the Parr family jobs that, firstly, alleviate the family’s financial troubles and secondly, validate their superpowers. In The Incredibles Bob Parr, aka Mr. Incredible, gets a well-paying job with Syndrome, a tech giant who uses Mr. Incredible’s powers to eliminate Supers. In ‘The Incredibles 2’ Helen Parr, aka Elastagirl, accepts a well-paying job from Devtech, a multi-billion dollar telecommunications company, whose co-owner Evelyn Devtech uses Elastagirl’s Super-status to eliminate Supers.
One way that The Incredibles 2 tries to avoid excessively resembling the first film is by
switching Bob’s and Helen’s domestic roles. Hilariously, Mr. Incredible discovers the joys and hardships of being a stay-at-home dad. “They keep changing math!” he proclaims, struggling with Dash’s homework. He tries to repair Violet’s teenage love-life, only to make it much worse.
Jack-Jack, the baby, starts exhibiting his powers—multiplying, walking through solid objects, shooting lasers out of his eyes, turning into a fire-demon, floating through different dimensions-to name a few. Undoubtedly, Jack-Jack is the star of the film, the most challenging baby one could possibly imagine. Mr. Incredible is saved from self-destructing by none other than Edna Mode. Edna is the only person who seems to understand Jack-Jack, claiming that, “He is bright and I am stimulating. We are perfect for each other,” and she invents a super-suit that contains his powers.
The film features a cast of new superheroes with powers ranging from deadly acid reflux and piercing screams, to creating ‘voids’ that allow objects to appear and disappear in space. With the addition of superheroes comes a great deal of Super-on-Super combat. After Evelyn Devtech uses hypnosis-goggles to control everyone but the children, it’s up to Dash, Violet, and Jack-Jack to save the day. They free their parents from hypnosis, and finally all of the Supers who band together to stop an enormous ship from crashing into Metrocity.
‘The Incredibles’ save the day, and the legal status of superheroes is restored. But the movie does not end on an unambiguously happy note. As Evelyn is arrested, Violet adds, “First of all, she’s rich and she’ll probably only get a slap on the wrist.”
