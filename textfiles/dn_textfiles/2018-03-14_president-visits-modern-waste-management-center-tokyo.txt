President visits modern waste management center in Tokyo

 
President Maithripala Sirisena, who is on a state visit to Japan, made an observation tour of modern waste management centre in Shinagawa in Tokyo, today.
Over 9.3 million people in Tokyo produces 11,000 metric tonnes of waste daily and there are 23 centres built for waste management.
The waste management centre in Shinagawa, which was visited by the President, processes 600 metric tonnes of waste daily.
These activities are carried out in an environmental friendly manner by utilizing modern technology.
Heat is exclusively converted into electrical energy in the waste management centre in Shinagawa, which is a byproduct of the waste management process.
While the entire Centre is run by electricity generated from waste, the remaining electrical energy is added to the national grid. 
President Sirisena said that he would inquire about such projects in order to solve the garbage disposal problem in Sri Lanka and would seek the possibility of obtaining assistance from Japan for such projects.
The chief of the waste management centre explained details of the work conducted in the centre to the President and the accompanying delegation.
Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva, Member of Parliament Ashu Marasighe, and other members were present on this occasion.
