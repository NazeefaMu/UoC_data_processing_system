Entrepreneurs will be encouraged: Minister Hashim

Assistance will be provided to entrepreneurs who use their talents and potential in their areas, said Highways and Road Development Minister Kabir Hashim.
He was addressing a meeting at the People’s Bank Kegalle branch to introduce ‘Enterprise Sri lanka development loan scheme.’
Minister Hashim said Rs. 200 million was allocated to each electorate for the ‘Gamperaliya’ rural development project introduced by the government, recently.
According to a survey conducted by the Central Bank last year, it was revealed that over 25 percent of the unemployed youths are willing to start self-employment projects if they are supported by loans. These youths are not demanding for government jobs and the government has now come to their rescue, he said.
Under the ‘Gamperaliya’ project, all state banks will have a special counter to assist borrowers seeking soft loans to start self-employment projects, the minister said.
If one individual with potential succeeds in his/her venture, 10 members of the family will stand to gain.
Therefore, prospective entrepreneurs should be assisted.
The officer at the ‘Gamperaliya’ Bank counter, therefore, has an important role when assisting those who seek loans, the minister said.
He added that small and medium-scale enterprises which employ over 45 percent of employees in the country contribute 52 percent to the GDP.Kegalle Regional Secretary Shyamalee Piyatissa, Mawanella Local Council Chairman Anura Chandana, former PC Member Upul Shyamal Bandara, UC Member Ishara Harischandra, Kegalle People’s Bank Provincial Manager Gamini Karunaratna, businessmen and others attended.
