To postpone debate on BC, PRECIFAC reports:I was never under pressure:Speaker
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday, said that he was not under any pressure from the Government to postpone the debate on the Bond Commission(BC) and PRECIFAC reports.
He made this clarification when Joint Opposition MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara charged that the Government wanted the debate on the two reports be postponed to avoid any unfavourable situation taking place.He accused that TNA MP M A Sumanthiran raised the language issue at the last moment to get the debate postponed as of the wish of the Government. “Why did he not raise the matter of Tamil translation when the House took up the same debate on February 6? Why did he wait until the last minute to communicate that problem?” he questioned.
Responding to the matter, MP Sumanthiran said he had specifically noted that the TNA would not take part in the debate on February 6 due to the non-availability of translated copies and that they expected the translations be ready when the House resumes the debate on February 20.
“MP Nanayakkara is ascribing motives to what I stated and doing so is against Standing Orders. I strongly oppose him ascribing motives to my very valid objection the other day,” he added.
The Speaker said the debate was postponed with the consent of the House.
Explosion will be probed: PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Parliament yesterday, that the Army Commander had notified him that the explosion which occurred in a passenger bus near Kahagolla, Diyatalawa, was due to a grenade explosion.
The Prime Minister said as soon as he heard of the incident, he had called the Law and Order Minister to inquire as to what had exactly happened. “However, the Law and Order Minister too did not have the exact details as initial investigations into the incident was being conducted. I found out that the Army was on the scene and was carrying out initial investigations. I spoke to the Army Commander Lt. General Mahesh Senanayake and he notified me that it was a grenade explosion. He said that a grenade could have been in one of the bags carried by a passenger. However, further investigations into the incident is underway,” he said.
The Prime Minister said so in response to a question raised in Parliament yesterday, by Joint Opposition member Dinesh Gunawardena regarding the explosion that occurred within a bus plying from Jaffna to Bandarawela carrying Army, Air Force and civilian personnel. “As news travels fast through many streams, don’t allow this incident to create unnecessary problems in the country and I urge that the correct information be revealed to the country.”
Meanwhile the Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayake said initial investigations had revealed that it was a grenade explosion. “Investigations are continuing and the Government Analyst had also commenced his investigation into the incident. Once investigations are completed, we could reveal more details about the incident, but for now, based on initial investigations, a grenade in a passenger’s bag had exploded, causing the fire,” he said.
Some GMOA officials barely possess three simple passes:Kiriella
Some GMOA officials who clamour for raising the standard of qualifications for medical education as A/ Level qualifications, barely had three simple passes, Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
He made this comment in Parliament yesterday, in response to a question raised by JVP MP Dr Nalinda Jayatissa. MP Jayatissa pointed out that there had been discussions to make three ‘S’ passes the minimum qualification to be eligible to study medicine.
“It requires three ‘A’ passes for students in Colombo to qualify to enter State Universities. In Gampaha, this requirement was 1A and 2Bs. We can hardly agree to make the minimum requirement three ‘S’ passes, at least make it three ‘B’ passes in order to maintain the required standards of medical education in the country,” he said.
Minister Kiriella said there were instances where those who possessed three simple passes had ended up being good doctors. He said among the GMOA officers are doctors who possessed only 3 ‘S’ passes.
However, he asked the JVP MP to present his proposals on the minimum qualifications for medical education, adding that he was ready to consider them
TNA MPs accused bribery, complains MP Saravanapavan
Raising a privilege issue TNA MP E. Saravanapavan said MP Nadesan Sivashakthi had made a statement that during the Local Government election, the TNA Members of Parliament had accepted a bribe of Rs. 20 million each from the Government in order to support the Budget 2018. “This was highlighted in all Tamil newspapers, the electronic media and the social media and all other parties had made use of this during their election campaigns.”
He noted that this had resulted in adverse reactions, substantially damaging their reputation. Since this was a privilege issue and it tarnished the image of the elected members, he urged the Speaker to take action against it.
Meanwhile, raising a point of order MP Nadesan Sivashakthi began to speak, but the Speaker refused to give him more time and asked him to sit down. However, despite the Speaker’s repeated requests and orders to sit down, he continued speaking. The Speaker then threatened to have him sent out of the Chamber unless he took his seat. “I am telling for the third time, would you kindly sit down or go out of the Chamber,” the Speaker retorted.
Then raising a point of order, TNA member M.A. Sumanthiran said, “The member raised a question of privilege and in the question of privilege, he made a complaint against another member.
Merely because he made a complaint, that member could not say that his name had been mentioned and start speaking.”
Therefore, he moved that whatever MP Sivashakthi said in response to the privilege issue raised by MP Saravanapavan be expunged from yesterday’s proceedings, to which the Speaker agreed and said he would look into it.
