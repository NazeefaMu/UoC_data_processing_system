MP Prasanna, wife permitted to travel abroad

The Colombo High Court yesterday permitted Gampaha District Parliamentarian Prasanna Ranatunga and his wife to travel to India for one week.
The Attorney General (AG) had filed indictments against former Western Province Chief Minister and his wife Maureen Ranatunga and another person on the charge of threatening a businessman over the phone and demanding Rs.64 million.
When the case came up before Colombo High Court Judge Manilal Waidyatilleke, the defence counsel appearing on behalf of the accused sought court’s permission to release their passports from court custody between November 21 and 27.
MP Prasanna Ranatunga and his wife are currently out on bail. The Attorney General filed indictments on 15 counts against three accused Prasanna Ranatunga, Maureen Ranatunga and Naresh Kumar Fareek based on charges of committing offences between April 6, 2015 and June 2, 2015.
