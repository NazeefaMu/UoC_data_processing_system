$27,500 for Beyonce’s hat

Singer Beyonce Knowles raised $27,500 at a charity auction by selling the hat she wore in her 'Formation' video.
Knowles donated the signed item to a Heritage Auction that benefits a non-profit organisation that provides support to lung transplant recipients.
The hat features a wide brim and a black ribbon, as well as her signature alongside the words: 'All my Love.' Initially, the item was expected to sell for less than $2,000, but several bidders became involved with the auction, which meant that the hat ultimately sold for $27,500. IANS
