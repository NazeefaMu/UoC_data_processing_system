Waiting for Wendt

To have died in your native land - Ceylon in 1944 and be reborn every year worldwide. How could it be possible? But before unraveling this mystery lets go back to May of 1907 when the Amateur Photographic Society of Ceylon organized the Islands first ever photography exhibition where Wendt Senior - Henry Lawrence played a pivotal role.
Until the year 1917 the Annual Exhibition was a feature of the Photographic Society organized together with Art Society of Colombo. If he had been around the Society young Lionel born in 1900 must have attended these exhibitions then.
The exhibition of 1917 would have been held just before he sailed to Britain to read Law.
However, it was after he returned to practice that he realized his calling was different and surprisingly it was through him that the Photographic Society and this long running exhibition was to have an enviable future.
He recommenced the exhibition in 1934 once again as an annual feature. Even though he passed away suddenly in 1944, this is how this photographic colossus and doyen of the art is reborn worldwide every year.
This year marks the 60th year as an international Photographic Competition & Exhibition will be held from November 21 to the 22 at the Lionel Wendt Art Centre, Colombo 07. As a National Exhibition it has been held for 81 years without a break.
To mark the event the society has also organized two concurrent events, an exhibition of photographs by much accomplished Indian Photographer Jayati Saha to be held at the Harold Peiris Gallery at the Lionel Wendt on November 21 and the 22 followed by a series of lectures by prominent photographers on topics such as Wild Life, Portraiture, Fashion and Underwater to be also held on the same days at the Lionel Wendt.
PSSL being the oldest photographic society in Sri Lanka has a rich history that can be traced back to the year 1906, when the Amateur Photographic Society of Ceylon was formed by Henry Lorenz Wendt, the father of Lionel Wendt - lawyer, artist, pianist and photographer, the Society has continued to be at the pinnacle of Photographic activities in Sri Lanka throughout. The Society was reincarnated in 1934 as the Photographic Society of Ceylon at the residence of Lionel Wendt, who continued the work begun by his father, along with a small group of enthusiasts interested in pictorial photography. The Society is housed at the Lionel Wendt Art Centre since 1950's, thus becoming the only society of photography in Sri Lanka, having its own studio, office and darkroom facilities. The year it is conducted in a much broader scale with the patronages of FIAP (International Federation of Photographic Art), PSA (Photographic Society of America) and UPI (United Photographers International), and conducted on a fully digital web enabled platform for entry, submission, payment and judging. The competition is conducted under three main categories of Open Color, Open Monochrome and Nature sections open to photographers worldwide. Nearly 400 participants from 42 countries submitted nearly 3000 images for the competition. The quality of images was of extremely high standard making judging an unenviable task to select the final 700 images. A total of more than 70 medals and ribbons will be awarded to winning entries which will include FIAP, PSA, RPS, UPI and PSSL Gold, Silver and Bronze Medals as well as Honorable Mention Certificates. Of the selected and winning entries 225 are to be displayed at the exhibition and a full color catalog with all the selected images was distributed to all entrants and sponsors. This year the catalog will be designed and printed as a hard cover edition in a much larger size than the previous years to mark the 60th year.
Apart from the many international awards the local entrants are eligible for challenge trophies and awards named after prominent members of the Society such as DCL Amarasinghe Challenge Trophy Best of show, Kalabushana LE Samararatne Challenge Trophy for Best Portrait, BP Weerawardena Challenge Trophy for Best Open Color and Dr SR Kottegoda Challenge Trophy for Best Open Mono.
This will also see the launch of the Lionel Wendt Memorial Trophy for most number of local acceptances.
This year too, the elite judging panel was headed by President Photographic Society of Singapore Goh Kim Hui who joined the panel of Sri Lankan judges as an honorary independent judge.
Local judges included some of the most eminent and expert photographers in the country, namely Henry Rajakaruna MFIAP, Bandu Gunaratne, Mithra Weerakone, Priyantha Amarasinghe, Rukshan Jayewardena, Lakshmnan Nadarajah, Namal Kamalgoda and Ranjith de Silva.
All events including the main exhibition will be held at the Lionel Wendt and will be open from 9.30am till 7.30pm. Those who are interested in participating at the presentation to be held at the Society should get in touch with the Administrative Secretary on 2690940 after November 15 and register themselves. Details of the presentation will be posted at www.pssl.lk by November 10.
