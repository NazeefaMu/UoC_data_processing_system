Pandemonium at Moragahahena Police

pandemonium was created inside the office room of Moragahahena Police in the Panadura Police Division on September 26 evening when a Police constable armed with a T-56 weapon entered the office room of the OIC and created a scene abusing the OIC. However, the OIC was not at the Police station at the time. The other policemen brought the armed policeman under control and snatched the weapon.
