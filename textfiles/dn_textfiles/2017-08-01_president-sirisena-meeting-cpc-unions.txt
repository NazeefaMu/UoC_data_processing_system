President Sirisena in meeting with CPC unions

 
A special meeting is underway between President Maithripala Sirisena and Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) trade unions at the Presidential Secretariat, in Colombo.
The trade unions are protesting the impending deal with India to jointly manage 99 oil tankers at the China Bay in Trincomalee. 
The trade unions had previously engaged in a trade union action but called it off after a meeting with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. 
The unions resumed trade union action on July 24 but called it off on July 26 in lieu of a meeting with President Maithripala Sirisena.
