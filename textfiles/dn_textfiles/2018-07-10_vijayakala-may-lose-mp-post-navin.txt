Vijayakala may lose MP post: Navin

Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake said Parliamentarian Vijayakala Maheswaran may lose her MP post once the disciplinary inquiry on her reaches its conclusion. Speaking to the Daily News, he said that she had to resign from her ministerial position as it was considered wrong to retain it after making such a statement.
“A party-level inquiry will be held and disciplinary action will be taken against her accordingly. She may as well lose her MP position after the inquiry,” he said.
