EU sees true democracy at work in NCM debate

European Union diplomats yesterday expressed that the recent No Confidence Motion debate in Parliament was an example of how democracy is working in Sri Lanka
European Parliament’s Committee on International Trade Chairperson Jan Zahradil said that EU has been able to see democracy working in Sri Lanka.
“We have been able to see democracy working in Sri Lanka,” said Jan Zahradil.
He and other EU MPs are visiting Sri Lanka this week to evaluate the first results of the country’s re-entry into the EU’s GSP plus trade programme.
The No-Confidence Motion, which the UNP defeated Wednesday night with a comfortable majority, was “a very good example of a real democracy, because the opposition has the full right to put forward a motion of no-confidence,” he said. “And the government has the full right to defend itself.”
“(It’s) a very good example of a vivid and vibrant democracy,” he added.
