Reflections: President's visit to New York

President Maithripala Sirisena on Saturday concluded his six-day official visit to New York where he made a speech at the United Nations' 72nd General Assembly.
During his time in New York, the President met the US President Donald Trump and had a meeting with Nepal's Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba. He also had bilateral discussion with Pakistan's Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi.
President Sirisena had special meetings with United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Prince Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein and Ambassador Thomas Shannon, US under Secretary of State for Political Affairs. The President addressed the 72nd General Debate of the UNGA, stressing that certain elements expected fast results which he said would merely be “short-term solutions.
In his speech, the President called upon the international community to seriously consider the tremendous progress made by his Government towards reconciliation, restoration of democratic freedom, human rights and the rule of law.
