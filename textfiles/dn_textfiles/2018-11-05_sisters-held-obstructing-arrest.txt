Sisters held for obstructing arrest

Panadura Additional Magistrate Kalhari Liyanage ordered cash bail of Rs. 10,000 with Rs. one million personal bail for two women suspects produced before court on November 1 by the Panadura North Police.
When the two suspects were produced before court by Sub Inspector Palitha Kannangara, attorney-at-law Nipuni Karunathileke, defending the suspects, told court that Panadura Walana Police had raided the suspects’ house for drugs. Police had attempted to arrest the suspects’ brother in connection with the drugs, when the sisters had interfered.
Thereafter, the police arrested the two women on charges of obstructing the duties of the police.
Sub Inspector Palitha Kannangara denied that the policemen had assaulted the two women suspects.
The house where they lived had allegedly become a distributing centre for heroin. The brother of the two suspects was arrested by police for possession of more than two grams of heroin.
The Additional Magistrate remanded the suspects pending further investigations.
