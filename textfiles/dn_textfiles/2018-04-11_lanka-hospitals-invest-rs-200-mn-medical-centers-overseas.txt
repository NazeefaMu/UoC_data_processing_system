Lanka hospitals to invest Rs 200 mn for medical centers overseas

Lanka hospital will be investing nearly Rs. 200 million to open medical centers overseas and in Sri Lanka.
Director Medical Services, Dr Sunil Ratnapriya said that they will open two centers in both the Maldives and Seychelles.
“We have observed that fair amount of our foreign patients are from these two countries and these centers will perform Lab tests and also felicitate patient transferred to Lanka hospital Colombo as well.”
He said in addition they will open three local medical centers as well and Panadura, Kurunegala and Batticaloa have been identified as locations.
Lanka hospital formally known as the Appolo Hospital is also looking at building another wing in their present premises in Narahenpita to meet the additional demand for bed space from patients.
Commenting on the new drug policy he said that they welcome this move. However he said that the government must study the proposal to offer ‘one rate’ for particular treatment (Eg caesarian child birth) for all private hospitals. “This is not practical as professional fees from doctors differ from one doctor to another and other overheads also vary.”
He said that the best option in this regard would be grade the hospitals similar to hotels and then it would be easier to offer one health package minus professional fees. Asked how a uniformed rate for tests was offered for dengue, he said that it was done since it was a national cause. (SS)
