16 SLFP members who left government requests seats at the opposition

 
The 16 Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) members who recently vacated their posts in the government requested the Parliament General Secretary to allocate seats for them at the opposition.
The 16 Parliamentarians, who voted in favor of the No Confidence Motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesingh, decided to leave the government after the motion was defeated in Parliament last month.
Their resignation letters were accepted by President Maithripala Sirisena on April 11.
