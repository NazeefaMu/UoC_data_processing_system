WISTA Sri Lanka holds meeting for members

 
WISTA Sri Lanka (Women’s International Shipping and Trading Association) recently held a meeting for their members.
The prime objective of WISTA is to encourage female representation in Maritime and related industries. The fraternity focusses on inspiring female university graduates and school leavers to enter into male dominated industry by assisting in securing appropriate jobs, mentoring and coaching female employees, and also supporting females to gain jobs in operations of ships; such as Gantry operators, Pilotage and Ship crew.
Striking a work life balance is a challenge for women in shipping; the jobs in Maritime require participation in networking events at extended working hours, travel overseas to meet principles/customers, engage in work groups and projects, participate in overseas conference calls which take up their personal time.
Therefore WISTA strives to support these women, contending to reach the helm in the business world while nurturing the next generation of leaders as young mothers.
The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue, Kalyani Dhahanayake made a speech at the event. Dhanayake in her speech shared how she has reached the helm of a government institution, an entity known for its revenue generation to the Government. She shared her career journey with the members, mentioning the personal sacrifices made, her investment of time and money in education and professional qualifications. She imparted her knowledge on tax, techniques on tax management and clarified to the membership, the impact of recent changes in the tax laws; particularly to the maritime industry.
Aligning themselves with the season of giving and sharing, WISTA membership had extended an invitation to the Sri Lanka Ports’ Authorities first ever female Gantry Crane Operators, in order to promote and empower women of all levels in this industry.
WISTA, is an international networking organization for women at management level involved in maritime transportation business and related trades and, acknowledged as a professional and highly reputable shipping organization with focus on improving levels of competency in the shipping industry.
WISTA has over 1800 members in 33 countries and pursues and supports the creation of international business relationships among WISTA members.
