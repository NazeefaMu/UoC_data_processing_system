The painting  is on the wall

Sculptures and inscriptions apart from information about dance can be gathered from paintings, which adorned the walls of the dance halls, and the temple courtyards. Indian paintings can be viewed regionally, for instance, north Indian paintings are different from the south Indian paintings. The south Indian paintings can be viewed according to the linguistic, religious, regional, and social factors. Mainly in the south Indian paintings, one sees the sketch work, and colour paintings. Most of these paintings reflect the social, political and cultural influence of that time.

The sketches existed in ancient times, are evidenced by certain verses, appearing in the epic Manimekali, and Nedunelvadi.
Brahmin’s art 
Certain verses in ancient works show that in order to enable the dancers to learn the dance strictly, according to the tradition, they were encouraged to learn from the works on paintings.
Silapathikaram, the ancient Tamil classic, states that in the dance hall where, Mathavi held the arangetram, there were four paintings, depicting Brahmins, Kings, Merchants, and vellalas.
One of the paintings depicts Lord Shiva seated on a tiger skin and watching a dance performance of the Apsaras. Another painting depicts, the cosmic dance of Lord Nataraja, watched by the devotees and by the Bramins on one side, and on the other the ruler Raja Raja Chola, and his threeconsorts enjoying theperformance  
Ancient paintings also depict the dances in the dance halls, on the pillars, walls, and curtains.
Most of the research, dealing with dance, and the paintings begin with the Pallava period, in the Tamil history. Although the Pallava period reflected the continuations of earlier periods, there is no concrete evidence to support it. Mainly the paintings which have been studied date from the 7th century A.D. Among the Pallava kings, Mahendra Varman was called ‘Tiger among the painters’. Mahendra Varman ’s skill in painting was recognised according to a stone inscription. Mahendra Varman wrote a thesis on paintings called ‘Thatchana Chithram”.
Related dances 
In the famous Chithannal caves, during Mahendra Varman’s reign, by his order, numerous paintings were painted. Paintings related to dance were painted on the walls. One of the most celebrated paintings is that of LORD NATARAJA, __ the cosmic dancer, at the entrance of the cave. And it is after seeing this painting that the saint Thirunavukarasa Nayanar sang ‘‘what else is there to see!’’. The paintings, during the Pallava period, still appear in the Kanchi Kailasa Nathar temple, and Mamandur caves.
Following the Pallava period, the paintings received a boost. During the Chola period, in Thanjai Bragatheeswarar temple, numerous paintings of dancers were painted on the walls and the roof.
One of the paintings depicts Lord Shiva seated on a tiger skin and watching a dance performance of the Apsaras. Another painting depicts, the cosmic dance of Lord Nataraja, watched by the devotees and by the Bramins on one side, and on the other the ruler Raja Raja Chola, and his three consorts enjoying the performance.
In most of these paintings, the expressions are very clear. Tragically the most famous paintings on the walls of the Thanjai Bragatheeswarar temple were damaged by a fire. But efforts were being made to resuscitate them.
Unlike sculptures and rock inscriptions, the paintings are likely to suffer damages and destructions, due to natural or man-made causes.
