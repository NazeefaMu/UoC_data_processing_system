PC polls: PAFFREL to take legal action

Legal action will be taken against the authorities if the government does not hold the Provincial Council Election on time, People's Action For Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL), Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi said.
He was addressing the media at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute in Colombo.
Hettiarachchi said not holding the Provincial Council Election on time violates the Constitution.
He said the only way the government can postpone holding the Provincial Council Election is by holding a referendum. Politicians should adhere to standards, he said.
Hettiarachchi said political leaders should hold elections. People should be vigilant whether Parliamentarians fulfill their needs. Not holding elections is a more serious offence than holding elections as sections, he said.
“The cut off percentage of votes for minor political parties should be reduced to two percent from the five percent of the total number of votes to ensure that they receive representation in Local Government bodies,” he said.
