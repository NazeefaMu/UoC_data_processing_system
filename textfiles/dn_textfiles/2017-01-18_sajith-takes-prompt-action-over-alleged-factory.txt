Sajith takes prompt action over alleged factory

Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa had directed the Hambantota District Labour Officer to check the health and environmental conditions of a battery factory in the Hungma Bata Atha Investment Zone and submit a report. The minister issued the directive at a recent meeting of the Hambantota District Coordinating Committee.
The minister took this action following reports that certain employees at the factory were infected with lead particles and that medical reports obtained by certain employees had established the fact. The minister said the factory management were informed about the development and certain employees had already left their jobs to avoid them being lead poisoned.
