Court decision on SAITM stands: Rajitha

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne warned that if anyone goes against the Court of Appeal decision in connection with SAITM, it will be considered contempt of court and a punishable offence with two years rigorous imprisonment, a Health Ministry Spokesman said.
The spokesman said Senaratne had said the private medical colleges should operate in the country and all parties have agreed.
“There was no objection to SAITM before 2015. The Kothalawala Defence University has a private medical faculty which charge money from medical students. The students receive training at the Sri Jayawardanapura Hospital. Earlier they received clinical training at the Colombo National Hospital. No one objected to that,” Dr. Senaratne said.
The minister also stated that he did not interfere in the SAITM issue and each medical student from SAITM pays Rs. 5,000 to the Government for the training they receive at the Avissawella state hospital and Kaduwela MOH.
The minister pointed out that some state medical faculties do not have the standard that SAITM has while some unqualified persons are in some state medical faculties.
