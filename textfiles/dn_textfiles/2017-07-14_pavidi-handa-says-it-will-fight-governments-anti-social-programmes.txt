Pavidi Handa says it will fight governments anti-social programmes

The Pavidi Handa Organisation said yesterday that the massive Sangha Conference would be organised shortly to protest against the harmful and anti-people social and economic programmes of the national unity government.
We are in the midst of a comprehensive political and economic crisis created by this Government,” Pavidi Handa Convener Ven. Muruththettuwe Ananda Thera said.
Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday, Thera said the Yahapalana Government had assured drastic changes when it came into power and pledged a number of benefits and relief to the people.
But when we look at what is currently taking place in the country, it is doubtful as to whether any real change had taken place. What has actually happened to this country is leading to destruction and lots of people are pushed into poverty.
The tremendous work undertaken and completed by the previous government is visible witnesses even though former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has been accused of corruption by the Yahapalana members.
It is evident from what is left for us to see that the previous government had done for the benefit of the country and the people.
But, this government has not started a single development project.
Leaders of this government are still opening only the projects that former government commenced. Bribery and corruption are pervasive within the last two and half years.
We are ready to reveal all information related to these corruptions in the near future,” the Thera said.
The Yahapalana government is today engaged in arresting Bhikkus who have raised their voices for the protection of Buddhism and our own self-identification.
Even though the government promised to give foremost place to Buddhism, it is now engaged in sealing the charity boxes of temples. Is this the way their protect Buddhism?
He further said the government is trying to hide the figures of dengue death cases and has directed the hospitals not to divulge details.
“But, we have actual details of hospital admissions and deaths occurred by Dengue and they will be revealed to the country soon. The government has also failed to provide a solution for garbage problems yet.
“It is necessary to provide permanent solutions to problems of the people instead of formulating a new Constitution,” the Thera added.
