Shed differences and work for the country: Samarasinghe

 
This is a government of reconciliation. Its a laudable concept of the President, Skills Development and Vocational Training Minister and Kalutara District Development Committee's co-chairman Mahinda Samarasinghe said.
"We should all work in a sincere and genuine manner with a true Sri Lankan identity by shelving all petty differences. Today, this platform itself symbolises this vision. All of us including Panadura UNP organiser Nandana Gunatilleke, Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka and myself have joined hands to serve the people in the area," he said.
Samarasinghe was addressing a meeting which followed the opening of the second stage of the Panadura public bus stand built at a cost of Rs. 8 million recently. He said it was the SLFP which won the Kalutara district at the last general election.
The minister said he had been in politics for the last 28 year and been a minister on five occasions.
He said he had never acted or spoken in public in an unbecoming manner or disgraced people. Samarasinghe said he had dedicated himself to work for the development and progress of the entire district and the country at large.
The minister said a certain parliamentarian who had even been critical of the President had accepted a deputy minister's post by going in bended knees.
Samarasinghe said he had been termed as a useless person by this same individual. He said he would request that person to be more disciplined and responsible in his talk.
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said Pandura is known as a Buddhist electorate.
It was electorates with a Buddhist majority like Panadura, Maharagama and Kelaniya which tipped the scales at elections, he said.
