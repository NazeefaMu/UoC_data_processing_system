Programme launched to improve southern rural schools

The Southern Province Education Ministry has launched a programme to improve rural students’ knowledge, SPC Education Minister Chandima Rasaputhra said.
He was addressing a seminar in Matara recently.
A recent survey showed the Southern region has 300 state schools and each school has fever than 100 students.
The Galle district has 111 schools and the Matara district 95 schools. Hambantota boasts 85 schools and southern region has 17,025 students. Many of them are from low income families and they cannot afford their school text books, bags, shoes and other essential items, the survey said.
SPC Minister Rasaputhra has allocated Rs. 90 million for 2018 to facilitate children from low income families. He has taken steps to assure that remote schools receive adequate aids to keep them open.
The Minister said he would initiate programmes to develop remote schools to match with the urban schools.
