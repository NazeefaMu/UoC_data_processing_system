CIPM Concludes Advanced MDP for RDB

CIPM Sri Lanka, the Nation’s leader in Human Resource Management, successfully concluded the customized Management Development Programme for Senior Chief Managers of the Regional Development Bank (RDB) recently.
The MDP was customized for the specific requirements of RDB in line with the objective of building skills, attitudes and competencies required to attain the growth and expansion plans of the apex development bank over the next 5-10 years.
CIPM Sri Lanka’s panel of experienced and expert facilitators in human resource management and other business disciplines led by U. A. C. Obeyesekere-Past President, CIPM Sri Lanka and Lead academic facilitator for the Advanced MDP analyzed the core competencies and skills required by the Bank based on their strategic plan and developed a detailed customized MDP to fill the gaps that were identified.
“We would like to thank the experienced team of facilitators from CIPM Sri Lanka who worked closely with our team to finalize the custom MDP which was fully tailored to meet the Bank’s unique needs. Their ability to draw upon a wide base of facilitators and trainers with specific knowledge and industry experience in areas which are important to a growing development bank is one of the key comfort factors that we received from CIPM Sri Lanka” said General Manager/Chief Executive Officer of RDB - T. A. Ariyapala, Regional Development Bank.
The MDP was held over 8 fortnightly Saturdays covering 4 months at “Miloda”, Academy of Financial Studies in Colombo 01 in which 45 Senior Bankers of RDB were trained and skills upgraded in an interactive manner utilizing a combination of classroom lectures, discussions, videos, practical individual and group assignments, presentations and case studies.
“We are delighted that CIPM Sri Lanka was able to successfully deliver the customized MDP for RDB which is one of the foremost development banks in the country providing yeoman service to the development objectives of the country” said Dhammika Fernando – President, CIPM Sri Lanka.
“A customized MDP rather than a General Programme for management development is appropriate in order to rapidly enhance and develop the skills, attitudes and competencies necessary to achieve a specific strategic plan. Our consultancy team which functions under the Consultancy, Research and Corporate Training Division has the capacity to develop similar MDPs and consultancy programmes for any organization, public or private, in any industry” he added.
CIPM was founded in 1959 and was subsequently incorporated by an Act of Parliament in 1976 and comprises of over 1200 Professional Members who serve in both public and private organizations.
