NO CANCELLATIONS -  NEW UL CHAIRMAN

New Chairman of SriLankan Airlines, G. S. Withanage yesterday asserted that there was no cancelation of bookings or arrivals due to the prevailing political distress.
“We have no cancellations or even postponements of bookings which have already been made in advance, Vithanage told ‘Daily News Business’ yesterday.
Vithanage, who is also the incumbent Secretary to the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation was appointed as the Chairman of the National Carrier, following the resignation of the former Chairman Ranjit Fernando. Also former Finance Ministry Advisor and SriLankan Airlines Director Mano Tittawela also resigned.
Vithanage also said that the next Board meeting would be held on November 26 at which a series of decisions would be taken with the recommendations made to the previous Board.

“I am aware of all the recommendations which were made to the then Board as I was the Ministry Secretary at that time as well,” he said, adding that “the new Board would be implementing all the recommendations”
One of the core plans of the airline for which lot of emphasis would be placed at the November 26 Board meeting would be on slashing of costs and the areas of that program would be deliberated at the November 26, Board meeting, he remarked.
