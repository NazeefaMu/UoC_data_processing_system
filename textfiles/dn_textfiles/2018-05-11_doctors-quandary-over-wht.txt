Doctors in quandary over WHT

Private medical doctors are to face a huge shock to the system with the latest deduction of withholding tax (WHT) announced by the Department of Inland Revenue.
The Department yesterday announced that the government introduced a withholding tax of 5% on payment for any service provided in the capacity of independent service providers such as doctors, engineers, accountants, lawyers, software developers, researchers, academics or any other similar service. It specifically said that payment for any type of vocational services provided as an independent service provider is subject to this tax.
A senior executive of a leading hospital speaking to the Daily News said that the worst hit from this new tax law would be the doctors (consultants) working in private hospitals. As previously the onus of declaring the amounts earned was strictly on these professionals themselves, however, now with 5% going in directly from the respective accounts departments of hospitals will give a clear idea of how much these doctors earn and if they have not been declaring the right numbers in the past to the Department of Inland Revenue, there is a sudden jump in their earnings recorded, this will cause some serious problems for them.
This move is designed to bring a large part of the population who are not currently under the tax net under the purview of the Department of Inland Revenue. Senior Chartered Accountant, N.R Gajendran from Gajma and Company, said that this would be leveling the playing field. However, the withholding agent in the scenario of the new law, is being trusted without trusting the taxpayer. So the withholding agent has to remit these taxes to the department. ‘In the past we had this withholding agency situation and why they removed it is because the withholding agents were not remitting the money to the Department. One of the biggest defaulters was the government institutions because they had cash flow problems.’
M. G. Somachandra, Deputy Commissioner General of the Inland Revenue Department, Withholding Tax (WHT) section, speaking to the Daily News said that a large number of doctors working in private hospitals are not in the tax net and in the future the Administrative Officers of the Private Hospitals have to remit 5% of the doctors income to the Inland Revenue Department. They expect through this system to include every individual that is due to pay taxes.
The Government directive says that the WHT should be deducted on the cases where the payee is a resident individual and the payer would be any person such as an individual, a partnership, a company, a trust, a body of persons corporate or unincorporated, an executor, a non-governmental organization, a charitable institution, unincorporated association, a friendly society, a building society, a pension fund, a provident fund, a retirement fund, a superannuation fund or similar fund or society, a public corporation, a board or authority; but excludes Sri Lanka Government.
Deputy Commissioner General, M.G Somachandra says that any payment over Rs. 50,000 per month will have to have this withholding tax deduction and the amount remitted to the department. If the taxed individual can prove that his/her annual income was less than half a million then he/she would get a rebate.
The way these new laws are framed it will increase revenue to the government coffers. Gajendran says that this tax will definitely increase government revenue because it will be easier to trace and track; and there will be transparency of the earnings of the individual taxpayer going to the Department.
Somachandra says that they believe it will take two or three months for this system to be implemented as he initially sees some teething problems due to the registration of taxpayers and obtaining of TIN number, etc. but he says that within about three months it will settle down.
