Case against former CJ, two others fixed for June 14

The case filed against former Chief Justice and former Attorney General Mohan Peiris, Court of Appeal Judge, Justice A.H.M.D. Nawaz and former Power and Energy Ministry Secretary M.M.C. Ferdinando was yesterday fixed for June 14 by the Colombo Chief Magistrate's Court.
When the case came up before Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara, the Court was informed that the Supreme Court has already issued an Interim Order preventing Bribery Commission's Director General from taking any further steps against three suspects including former Chief Justice Mohan Peiris in the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court.
On January 18, the Bribery Commission filed a corruption case in the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court against former Chief Justice and former Attorney General Mohan Peiris, Court of Appeal Judge A.H.M.D. Nawaz and former Ministry Secretary M.M.C. Ferdinando. Taking into consideration the facts, Chief Magistrate had issued summons on the three accused to be present in Court on March 8. However, they were not present in Court since the Supreme Court has issued an Interim Order regarding the magisterial proceedings.
This is over an allegation that they conferred a wrongful or unlawful benefit, and favour or advantage on the perpetrators who had been accused of misappropriating funds belonging to Lanka Electricity Company (LECO).
