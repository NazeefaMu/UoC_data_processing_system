Cafe Mandara opens in Kataragama

In a bid to add healthy foods and a new dining experience to the public, Mandara Resorts Kataragama has opened its new café, pastry shop, Cafe Mandara adjoining the hotel recently.
Manager of the Hotel, Mahesh De Silva said that though there was several star class hotels in the area, outside guests were unable to patronise this luxury dining experience and this is the reason they decided to open out an outlet to serve the general public.
“We service Sri Lanka food as well as western cuisine in this restaurant where take away facility too is available.”
He said that since the restaurant is situated in the close proximity to Kataragama there is a growing number of clientele who patronise this.
A special show kitchen outlet too, is being built to serve instant food such as Kottu’ which is very popular among guests.
