‘Time to prioritise green logistics  development initiatives and policies’

The International training programme on Green Freight and Logistics Development has concluded at the Thai International Cooperation Agency in Bangkok, Thailand, recently.
The training programme aims to promote awareness of the importance of sustainable practices in the transport and logistics industry by bringing together 19 participants from various countries spanning three continents; Burundi, Cambodia, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Jordan, Kyrgyz Republic, Lao PDR, Madagascar, Malawi, Morocco, Panama, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Tunisia, and Zambia.
While addressing the final session of the training programme, Chitral Jayawarna, Deputy Chief Manager (Communication & Public Relation Division), Sri Lanka Ports Authority, has stressed the importance of applying green logistic initiatives and policies in Sri Lanka.
“Sri Lanka going to implement green logistics development initiatives to develop the projects and already mapping the strategies for developing the projects such as green warehousing facilities, e-Docs (Electronic Document Management System),e-Port Permits issue system, e RTGs and some e initiatives for logistics operations,” he said.
He also added by saying that the transport sector should have to restructure with new technologies to reduce carbon emission.
Sri Lankan government is encouraging people to use electric vehicles. Currently, more than 15% of vehicles are electric vehicles in Sri Lanka; this is a benchmark in the region. It is time government to subsidies for more green initiatives such as green transportation to get maximum benefits while protecting the environment.
Sri Lanka can promote electric bike and three-wheelers. It is very important and convenient transportation mode suit for Sri Lanka. Statistically, in 2017, close to 35 million electric bikes were sold globally and out of over 90% was in China alone. In 2016 the total electric bike fleets on China’s roads were about 20 million.
The market projections indicate that the global electric bike sale could reach 40 million in 2025, and about 50 million in 2035 and could be completely electrified by 2045.
Freight transport is responsible for around 90% of all logistics emissions. The logistics creates around 10-12% of logistics emissions. Logistics-related Green House Gass (GHG) emissions typically 3-15% of carbon footprint of consumer goods (Source: SLoCaT, World Economic Forum).
New Urban Agenda is very important to sustainable development; therefore, New Urban Agenda for Sri Lanka is very vital. New Urban Agenda was unanimously adopted at the United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development (Habitat III), serving as a new vision for our cities and municipalities for the next 20 years.
UNDP demonstrated its full support to the implementation of the New Urban Agenda with the official launch of its Sustainable Urbanization Strategy.
The Plan recognizes that rapid urbanization and changing demographic patterns are challenging conventional thinking on development pathways and that addressing urban challenges requires cross-cutting, integrated applications of expertise and investment, customized for each country and circumstance and driven by global best practices and international standards.
Urban Freight Planning and logistics concepts are enabling efficient access to products and services, while minimizing their impact on the environment and liveability of the city and maximizing their contribution to a sustained inclusive and sustainable economic growth.
The traditional economic performance criteria is respected while attaining environmental criteria but transformation of the fright sector aiming at reducing emission intensity, pollution, and fuel consumption by promoting economic growth across the region.
Sri Lanka is still mapping some policies related to the Green Freight and Logistics with the relevant stakeholders. It takes time to develop. Policies should have to align with sustainable fright for sustainable development.
