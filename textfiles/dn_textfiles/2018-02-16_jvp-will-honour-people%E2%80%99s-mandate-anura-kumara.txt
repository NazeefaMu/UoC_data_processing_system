JVP will honour people’s mandate: Anura Kumara

JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday assured that they will honour the confidence placed on the party by voters and safeguard the value of the mandate given by them.
Addressing the media yesterday at the JVP Headquarters, the JVP leader said people have divergent expectations for the political parties they support. The implementation of socio-economic policies is the main expectation of voters who support the JVP.
“As a political movement, the JVP has to behave responsibly to fulfill the expectations of voters who placed confidence on the policies of the party,” he said.
According to the final results of the Local Government Election 2018, the JVP has secured nearly 715,000 votes and around 434 JVP candidates have been elected to the Local Government bodies. The number of JVP members elected to the Local Government bodies had increased by 360 which remained as 74 members earlier.
“When we compare it with the results of the General Election, the number of votes received by the JVP had increased by 170,000.”
“The people of this country should extend their support to create a JVP centered people’s movement because Rajapaksa’s political movement has no real need to fulfill people’s expectations.”
