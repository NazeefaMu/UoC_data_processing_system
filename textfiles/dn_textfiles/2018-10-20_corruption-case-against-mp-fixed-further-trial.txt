Corruption case against MP fixed for further trial

A corruption case filed against former Minister and Kalutara District Parliamentarian Rohitha Abeygunawardena was yesterday fixed for further trial on December 11 by Colombo High Court.
This is for the alleged unlawful acquisition of assets estimated at Rs.41.1 million. An investigations officer attached to the Bribery Commission testified before High Court Judge Sampath Wijeratne yesterday.
The High Court had earlier overruled preliminary objections raised by the former minister against the Bribery Commission’s decision to amend the charges and decided to proceed with the trial.
The Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed an indictment in the Colombo High Court on two counts against former Minister Rohitha Abeygunawardena for the unlawful acquisition of assets estimated at Rs.41.1 million.
In his indictment, the Director General of the Bribery Commission alleged that the former minister had committed this offence by way of undeclared assets in between 2004 to 2006.
The Director General alleged that the former minister had unlawfully made 66 monetary transactions, constructed a house and purchased a jeep in contravention to the section 23(a) of the Bribery Act.
