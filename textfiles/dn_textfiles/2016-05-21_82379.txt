CB Treasury issue: Govt has acted transparently - PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Parliament yesterday, that the government had acted in a transparent manner with regard to the Central Bank Treasury Bond issue.
All details with regard to the issuance of Treasury Bond reports to the Public Finance Committee by the Monitory Board of the Central Bank have been transparent. The amount of foreign reserves too reports to the Committee at the end of each quarter. In addition, my Ministry reports to Parliament at the end of each quarter, the performances of the economy and the utilization of foreign reserver. There are many Select Committees and the COPE in Parliament too investigate these. If there is anything suspicious, why do the members not utilize these opportunities Once we bring in the Right to Information Bill, the people would known all the information with regard to the economy.
The Prime Minister responding to an oral question raised by UPFA MP Vasudewa Nanayakkara who questioned about the Central Bank Treasury Bond issue in 2015, said it is our responsibility to handover these investigations to the Police. There would be facts which would prove or disprove these allegations. Then Opposition members could question anything concerning issues from the subject Minister.
'Calamity due to JO dashing coconuts'
MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena yesterday, requested for a special debate in Parliament over the prevailing emergency situation in the country due to floods and landslides.
He urged the Prime Minister to convene a special sitting of Parliament next week to have discussions in this regard. “We are deeply concerned over the prevailing situation. Life rescue missions are going on. Loss of lives, spread of various diseases leading to a possible epidemic and damages to property and businesses have been reported in many parts. Therefore, we urge the Prime Minister to facilitate an urgent debate on the national disaster situation,” he said.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe proposed that until a complete report from the Disaster Management Ministry was produced, a time limit was necessary to proceed in this regard. “I have ordered the Disaster Management Minister to produce a full report. Let us have this discussion based on the report” he said.
At this point, the Prime Minister in a rather sarcastic tone, reminded that such a disaster would not have taken place, had not the Joint Opposition dashed coconuts in Kovils. State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe rising to a point of order, asked the Joint Opposition MPs to go to the field and assist the affected people, adding that debating in the House would not be of any help for relief distribution work. He said the Government has decided to pay compensation for all damaged houses, irrespective of whether those were illegal constructions or not.
MP Gunawardena at this point, stated that they do not require any invitation to get on to the field and assist the people.
Solar Power for Parliamentary complex
The Parliamentary Business Committee has focused on the possibility of providing solar power to the Parliamentary complex.
Party leaders have agreed to shift from the present power system to the use of solar power in Parliament at the last Party leaders meeting held on May 17, Parliamentary sources said.
Power and Renewable Energy Deputy Minister Ajith P Perera had proposed that a solar system could be installed in Parliament in addition to the existing power system as it has already been done in other
parliaments as well, Parliamentary sources said.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and all other members of the Committee unanimously agreed to the proposal, the sources said. The meeting was attended by Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala, Deputy Chairman of Committees Selvam Adaikkilanathan, Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella, Leader of the Opposition R Sampanthan, Chief Government Whip Gayantha Karunatillake, Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake, Ministers Dr Rajitha Senaratne, Mahinda Samarasinghe, Ajith P Perera, MPs Dinesh Gunawardena and Douglas Devananda.

He said that the Sustainable Energy Power Authority has been instructed to design the plans for the project without harming the original architectural structure of the Parliament complex.

However, when the Speaker was moving to the next item on the order paper, MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena said that they called for a division for the Supplementary Estimate. However, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya declined, stating that it had been already passed and it was too late to ask for a vote.
MP Gunawardena continued to object at this point. The Speaker observing that the Supplementary Estimate was presented again as of the agreement of all Party Leaders, asked the concerned member to end the argument.
No threat to Ambatale Water Treatment Plant - Hakeem
Urban Development, Water Supply and Drainage Minister Rauff Hakeem told Parliament yesterday, that there is no threat to shut down the Ambatale Water Treatment Plant at this moment resulting in water cuts to Colombo and adjacent areas.
Excerpts from the message:
Making a special Ministerial statement, the Minister said that several social media sites have reported the Ambatale new intake had been closed, but these reports are false.
Due to flood waters rising in the Kelani river, the Ambatale new intake had to be kept under careful observation for the past few days. Only if the water level reaches 23 feet, we may be compelled to completely shut it down to 19 feet by early morning today. We have also kept the necessary water pumps on standby to pump out water seeping into the pump house and the Navy's assistance in this regard must be appreciated. Due to the natural phenomenon of the sea level increasing during the last two days before Poya and 2 days after the Poya reaching its peak during Poya Day, we are closely monitoring the high tide that is being reported. Last morning, there was a 0.4 metre rise in the sea level observed between 3 and 4 am. It is reported tomorrow being Poya and it may rise up to 0.5 metres. In such a situation, discharge of water from the river would slow down and the rising water level could be observed. With the receding flood levels, I could confidently say that it would not reach the critical 23' which would necessitate any shut down of the Ambatale New Intake. We must also assure consumers that there is no truth to the rumour that the Kelani river water had been severely polluted with oil. We have been constantly checking the water for impurities and could guarantee the quality of water that had been treated and supplied to consumers.
As a result of the unusually heavy rainfall and the flood situation during the last few days, many of our water intakes have been damaged and filled with mud and silt. In addition, the power supply interruption and landslide situation have caused disruptions to the water supply.
In order to overcome the situation, we have cleaned and repaired most of the intakes and where necessary, obtained the assistance of the Sri Lanka Navy for cleaning operations. Further, diesel operated generators have been utilized to maintain a minimum supply. Actions have been taken to provide temporary storage tanks and supply water through bowers to hospitals, other essential institutions and camps provided for displaced persons.
All our Regional Officers and the Provincial Regional Support Centres are coordinating with the relevant Disaster Management offices, District Secretariat and Divisional Secretariats to maintain water supply to essential areas and to ensure at least the minimum water supply needed.
In order to maintain the safety of water supply, NWSDB has increased the level of residual chlorine in the systems and also strengthened the Water Quality Surveillance mechanism by deploying Chemists and other relevant staff.
NWSDB is constantly coordinating with the Department of Irrigation and Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka in order to minimise water levels in rivers and reservoirs, so that response plans could be initiated. Further maintenance and repair gangs have been mobilized to face any unexpected emergency situations. In Avissawella, intake pumps were submerged since yesterday. Due to reseeding water levels the situation will be rectified today.
There is no issue in Kethhena WTP and Kandana WTP located along the Kalu Ganga. Hence, there is uninterrupted water to Kalutara and Panadura.
In the Western North region, the following situations have arisen due to flooding.
