The woman who read 100 books within a month

Meet Therese, she’s a business development manager living in Berlin, Germany. Last month, she managed to read over 100 nonfiction titles in psychology, politics and leadership.
It started with a bet. A colleague challenged her to read Malcolm Gladwell’s Outliers: The Story Of Success in two hours.
As determined as she was, she couldn’t meet the deadline.
She got through the first few chapters relatively quickly but found it impossible to finish the book in the designated 2 hours. Although she lost the bet, she had an idea.
She found several websites, blogs and apps that transform books into ‘bite-sized’ content. In the end, she opted for the Blinkist app. To produce quality insights from every book, she learned that they have over 100 literary experts hard at work. She was also convinced by the audio function which allowed her to listen to the learnings throughout her day.
With this cool new sidekick, Therese set a new goal for herself – she would read the key insights from 100 books in just one month. Read all about her experience in her own words below!
How many titles did you read in total?
102 to be exact. It might sound like a lot, but the Blinkist packs take only 10-15 minutes to read. I read roughly 3 titles a day, mostly during commutes.
What are some of the most interesting things you’ve learned?
There were so many! Here are the funniest ones:
I learned that if I go out with a group of friends for dinner, I should order my meal first. This will make me happier with my choice. Sounds crazy, but it’s true! (Predictably Irrational by Dan Ariely) I haven’t tried this one yet, but supposedly it’s better for my health to put butter in my coffee instead of milk. (Bulletproof Diet by Dave Asprey)
I learned that before the onset of agriculture, women used to have more sexual freedom than men. (Sex at Dawn by Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jetha) I can never look at trees the same way again. Apparently, they have personalities and are able to learn. This is why every tree sheds their leaves differently! (The Hidden Life of Trees by Peter Wohlleben)
Who is your favorite author?
That’s a tough one. I really enjoyed Dale Carnegie’s books, they’re all self-help classics. Richard Dawkins’ books about the human race are also very interesting. But I’m going to settle on Dan Ariely.
His book Predictably Irrational on human behavior has given me the best insights for my job yet.
