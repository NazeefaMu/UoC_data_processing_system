Lankan in UK jailed for killing wife’s paramour

A husband who beat his estranged wife’s paramour to death after kidnapping him in Milton Keynes, was jailed for life with a minimum sentence of 18 years.
The husband, Gnanachandran Balachandran, 38; organised the abduction of his wife’s lover, Suren Sivananthan, 32; from the Secklow Gate shopping area near Milton Keynes Theatre on January 20, ITV news reported.
For 12 hours, Suren was held captive, plied with alcohol and beaten in three different locations. He suffered 87 injuries. Two head injuries were the cause of death. The body of Suren, who lived in Canada, was left on the ground in sub-zero temperatures outside a parade of shops in Great Linford.
A jury at Luton Crown Court found Balachandran guilty of murder, recently.
Judge Richard Foster jailed him for life, ordering that he serve a minimum sentence of 18 years.
A 17-year-old accomplice was also convicted of murder and was sentenced to custody for life with a minimum term of 11 years.
