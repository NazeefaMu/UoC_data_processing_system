Pocock wins Australia's top  rugby union award

SYDNEY, Friday - Influential flanker David Pocock capped his return from a sabbatical by being named Australian rugby union's best player by his peers on Friday, taking out the 2018 John Eales Medal.
The Wallabies talisman, with 262 votes, easily outpolled his nearest challengers -- Lukhan Tui (139) and Dane Haylett-Petty (132).
Pocock, who returned for the Ireland series in June after taking a year out to perform charity and educational work, earned the gong for a second time after also winning in 2010. He joins George Smith, Nathan Sharpe and Michael Hooper as two-time winners, with fullback Israel Folau the only player to win it three times.
The popular Pocock was also voted the fans’ choice for Wallaby of the year.
In other awards, the Queensland Reds’ Taniela Tupou, known as “Tongan Thor”, was named Australian Super Rugby player of the year. He also took the rookie of the year accolade. Wario was refused permission to have his passport returned to enable him to travel back to Austria to resume his duties as Kenya's ambassador to the country.
The other two ministry officials, Haron Komen, who was the administrative secretary and financial officer Patrick Kimithi Nkabwa, also pleaded not guilty.
A total of 55 million shillings ($545,000) was allegedly misappropriated during the Rio Olympics.
