Return of the  composer

 
Suresh Maliyadde is a modern day progressive, musician who is a composer, director and a keyboard player. He embraces elements of Rhythm and Blues, soul and funk while adopting freer stylistic elements of jazz into his compositions. As part of composing music for many singers, Maliyadde helped redefind the role of jazz and classical rhythm sections in Sri Lankan music, and was one of the first Sri Lankan composers to embrace fusion styles. Yet for all his relentless experimentalism, Maliyadde's music is often melodic and accessible; he has had many songs achieve success among contemporary audiences. Maliyadde came to fame as a composer in high school, composing his first arrangement at the age of 18, while in 10th grade at Royal College, Colombo, Sri Lanka. The years that followed saw him play for bands such as Echo, Tri Star, Super 7, Shakthi and Fortunes.
Suresh has been the maestro keyboardist on tour for Nanda Malini, and Amaradeva in USA, UK, Australia and Canada. With such accomplishments under his belt it was natural for him to evolve as a Music Director/Producer of Sri Lanakan music. Suresh Maliyadde is the founder and owner of the Fame Recording Studio in Colombo. The state of the art sound studio produces many artists with Maliyadde's label utilizing Nuendo and Pro Tools interfaces to bring crystal clear sound that is parallel to any multi platinum studio production in the industry. This very drive for innovative production led to his latest venture, offering direction and co-production to Amarasiri Peries, Kasun Kalhara and Uresha Ravihari at Bishop College Auditorium on July 15 at 7 pm. This is his contribution to the Welfare Society of the Sarasavi Group of Companies.
Suresh Maliyadde's music scores also extended to movies and television. He composed sound tracks for Rupavahini teledrama production "Vasantha Kusalane" and "Pem Piyawara". For his work in tele dramas, he has been nominated for best composer for tele drama sound track category.
