To Beliatta by train, a reality in 2019

With the commencement of the tamping of the Southern Railway extension from Matara to Beliatta recently, travelling to Beliatta by train will become a reality.
The Railway extension to Beliatta is expected to be opened early next year. China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation (CMC) is the main contractor for Phase One of the Southern Railway extension project.
Tamping the ballast under the railway line to make it more durable and correct the alignment of the rails is the final phase of the railway construction process. Test runs could be done only after the track is tamped twice. Before the introduction of mechanical tamping machines or ballast tampers, the task was done manually. Commencement of tamping was held up for a while as the machine owned by the Sri Lanka Railway was being repaired.
The 26.75km railway extension from Matara to Beliatta is the first phase of the proposed Matara – Kataragama Railway extension and has cost the government more than US$ 278 million.
Phase Two will extend the Railway line from Beliatta to Hambantota which will be beneficial to the Hambantota Port and the proposed Industrial Promotion Zone.
In the third phase, the railway line would be extended from Hambantota to Kataragama, enabling the public to travel to the sacred city by train.
