Amitabh and Rishi in the  most unusual father-son story

The last time we saw Amitabh Bachchan and Rishi Kapoor together on screen was 27 years ago. Well, fans of the actors can brace themselves as the duo is set to grace the silver screen together once again with their upcoming film ‘102 Out Not’, which is set to hit the theatres on May 4, 2018.
The makers of the film dropped a teaser trailer on Friday, and it is sure to melt your hearts. Bachchan and Kapoor are seen in an entirely new avatar and the chemistry they share is out there for the world to see. While Amitabh plays the role of a 102-year-old man, Rishi plays his 75-year-old son. TNN
