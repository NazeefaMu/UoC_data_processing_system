SL gains GSP+ effective tomorrow

Sri Lanka will be granted duty free access to European markets under the Generalized System of Preference Plus (GSP +), effective tomorrow (May 16).
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake yesterday said the restoration of the facility, GSP Plus, will be published in the European Commission official journal today.
EU GSP will enter into force on the day following its publication in the EC official journal.
Minister Karunanayake said that supported by the GSP + status, the country will be able to generate 10, 000 to 20, 000 jobs.
The facility stands to create a major growth in the country’s apparel industry.
The country lost considerable revenue on garment exports after the European Union had revoked its GSP + in 2010 due to its failure to implement a number of core human rights treaties, namely the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and Convention against Torture (CAT). Karunanayake said with the advent of the unity government in 2015 led by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Rani Wickremesinghe they addressed many issues that had led to the withdrawal of GSP + by the European Commission.
“We have cleared the hurdles,”Karunanayake said. “The GSP + will create opportunities for our economic growth. It will diversify our exports to the EU market,” he said.
