Standard Chartered’s  transaction banking wins  big at Asset awards

Standard Chartered’s Transaction Banking carried away four out of the five coveted awards at The Asset Triple A Treasury, Trade, Supply Chain and Risk Management Awards 2017 for the South Asia region.
Standard Chartered Sri Lanka was awarded the following awards in the Best Service Providers category for: Supply Chain Solutions, Cash Management, Trade Finance, and E-Solutions and Technology Partner.
Roger Norton, Country Head Transaction Banking, Standard Chartered Sri Lanka, said: “This is an important encouragement to the team to be recognised for the service and solutions we bring to our clients.”
“The Asset awards are Asia’s preeminent recognition for those organisations that have excelled in their respective industries, and we are delighted to be the recipients of four awards.”
The awards recognised Standard Chartered’s accomplishment of mandates in the apparel, and oil and gas industry where the Bank has helped clients reduce their cash conversion cycle, improve efficiency, and reduce costs.
Clients now enjoy a greater benefit as the automation of current processes has facilitated reduction in manual work and proactive risk management.
The Bank has achieved a mix of both payment and collection mandates reinforcing Standard Chartered’s ability to offer bespoke solutions to address client needs.
The awards also acknowledged the bank’s differentiated trade finance capabilities such as offering structured Receivables Financing.
Standard Chartered Sri Lanka has won ‘Best Cash Management Bank’ and ‘Best Trade Finance Bank’ for the second consecutive year, reiterating the Bank’s exemplary capabilities in the cash and trade management space.
The Asset awards has close to 20 years of experience conducting awards programmes and has gone from strength to strength in distinguishing best-in-class organizations and individuals. The awards programmes are built upon a stringent methodology that is combined with a rigorous approach in selecting the best institutions and individuals operating in Asia.
The honours are adjudicated by The Asset’s Board of Editors and the Asset Benchmark Research team who collectively have several decades worth of experience evaluating awards in Asia.
