Oil palm cultivation in Kegalle comes to an end

The oil palm cultivation in Kegalle district would be brought to an end, said Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya.
He said that there had been a protest from various groups of people including the environmentalists against the oil palm cultivation in Kegalle district. "The Kegalle District Development Committee decided not to allow the oil palm cultivation in Kegalle district," Minister Siyambalapitiya said. "So we would take actions to stop the oil palm cultivation totally. Steps are being taken to get a Court order preventing the oil palm cultivation in the district."
Kegalle District Secretary Chandrasiri Bandara said that there was a trend in Kegalle district to replace the rubber cultivation with oil palm cultivation. "However, 65 percent of the lands in Kegalle district is sloped and the rubber plantation acted as a forest cover," Bandara said. "So the public was cautious and protested against the oil palm cultivation."
He also said that later with the intervention of Minister Navin Dissanayake the cultivation of oil palm cultivation was suspended temporarily until the environment report is prepared by a committee appointed by the Kegalle District Secretariat. He added that however, some of the Rubber Estate Companies in Kegalle district were continuing the oil palm cultivation secretly.
He added that due to this reason and after considering the impact on the environment, it has been decided to bring the oil palm cultivation to an end in Kegalle district.
