Son kills 83-year-old mother

An 83-year-old woman has been allegedly murdered by her son at Kodikaragoda, Morawaka.
According to the Police, the woman was beaten to death by her son after her refusal to transfer the legal documents of a land belonging to her under the suspect’s name. The woman was a mother of three and a resident of Udakoratuwa, Kodikaragama in Morawaka.
The Police said the three children of the suspect had attempted to stop the assault on their grandmother, but the attempt had failed. The suspect, under the influence of liquor, had beaten the woman with a wooden bar to get her will to transfer the documents under his name.
After the murder, the eldest son of the suspect had managed to lock him up in a room, but the suspect had broken the wooden door by hitting it with an axe and come out of the room. The suspect had destroyed goods at his home and fled.
Morawaka Police are investigating.
