Havies have the edge over Police today

The battle between two top rugby sides Havelock’s SC and Police SC in their Dialog ‘A’ Division inter-club league rugby first round match for the 2016/17 season at Police Park should turn out to be a close game today.
The match will kick off at 4.00 pm.
Havies who played really well in their season’s opener last week with an impressive (29-5) victory against Air Force at Ratmalana should have the edge over the somewhat depleted Police outfit which lost to the formidable Navy side 8-29 at Police Park.
Havelock’s have been training hard under their new former Sri Lanka national coach Ronnie Ibrahim and are determined to pull off a morale-boosting win.
Police SC on the other hand trained really hard under the watchful eyes of their new head coach Sudath Sampath who is also the present Sri Lanka national under 20 head coach of the Sevens team.
The cops will have to be at their level best if they are to beat the high riding Havies outfit in their own den.
But going by the present form the two teams are in, Havelock’s will definitely go out as the favourites to clinch this contest.
Teams:
Havelocks (Probable XV): Dushmantha Priyadarshana ‘Bodhi’ (captain), Prasath Madushanka, Ashan Darling, Jason Melder, Shehan Dias, Shenal Deelaka, Sharo Fernando, Lasindu Ishan, Sudam Sooriarachchi and Niroshan Fernando, Chamara Dabare, Nishon Perera, Hirantha Perera, Kevin “Kutty” Dixon, Dulaj Perera, Coach: Ronnie Ibrahim.
