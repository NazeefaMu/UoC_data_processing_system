True freedom established in past two years: PM

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe said true freedom was established during the last two years by the government while carrying out true development.
“The majority of people decided to vote in favour of forming a national unity government aiming to experience true freedom and true development on January 8, 2015,” he said. The Prime Minister was addressing a ceremony to mark the commencement of the third year of President Maithripala Sirisena in office,at the BMICH yesterday.
The event was held under the theme “The dawn of three years in the era of sustainability”.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said that the government has established and ensured freedom for everyone including media freedom. As a result of that freedom, even the President and the Prime Minister are criticised. But, it is also significant that, no one is harassed or killed under this government.
Chief Minister of Andra Pradesh Nara Chandrababu Naidu attended the ceremony as a special invitee of the occasion.
“The government has established freedom in order to for everyone to exprees themselves. As a democratic government, the government hears those voices and makes the necessary changes if needed,” he said. The Prime Minister pointed out that there is a cordial rapport between Sri Lanka and the Andra Pradesh since the era of Anuradhapura.
Prime Minister Wickremasinghe said that South Asia is developing rapidly when compared with the other regions of the world. Therefore, the countries in this region have a better opportunity and potential to utilise the trend.
Speaking on the past two years of the government, the Prime Minister said that it is not an easy task to bring a country, which suffered tremendous destruction to normalcy.
“The government’s task to bring normalcy back to the country was no easy task.Establishing coexistence in a destroyed country is difficult but we achieved it. Now, we are working togehter like brothers,”he said. The Prime Minister added that it is also difficult to link two rival political parties together. Forming this national unity government can also be considered as a significant achievement since during the last five decades, the main political parties were at two ends.
He added that the government has taken initiatives for the country’s economic prosperity. Under this not only Colombo but also many other districts including Trincomalee, Hambantota etc are being developed.
“But, it is regrettable that certain people are trying to hamper and stifle the development drive. It is a great betrayal,” the Premier said.
The Prime Minister further said that new laws should be implemented to take the country forward. It is nothing new to the world as many countries have implemented new laws from time to time reach our goals.
