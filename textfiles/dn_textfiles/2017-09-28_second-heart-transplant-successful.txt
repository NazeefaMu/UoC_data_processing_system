Second heart transplant successful

The second successful heart transplant operation was carried out by a team of 20 specialist doctors at the Kandy General Hospital on September 27. The operation took nearly 6 hours to complete.
The beneficiary of the heart transplant was Sachini Sevvandi (19) of Aluthgama who had been warded at the Hospital’s Cardio Thoracic Unit for nearly 7 months due to a week heart. Sachini’s father Mahesh Kumara said his daughter was progressing well after the operation, according to the medical team.
Although the transplant was earlier scheduled for September 19 it was abandoned at the last minute due to a tug-of-war between the Consultant doctors.
Hospital Director Dr. Saman Ratnayake said the transplant operation was abandoned on September 19 due to a shortcoming in the equipment to be used.
The first ground breaking heart transplant was performed at the Kandy General Hospital on July 7 and the patient who benefited is now leading a healthy life.
The second transplant surgery was done on September 27 after a lapse of two and a half months.
The heart needed for the second transplant was harvested from Nalinda Bandara Sakalasuriya (28) of Kapuliyadda, Thalathuoya who was pronounced brain dead at the Kandy hospital Intensive Care Unit following serious injuries caused in a motor cycle accident.
His parents had expressed willingness to donate his heart to facilitate the transplant and give life to another deserving person.
When the first heart transplant surgery planned on Sevvandi was abandoned at the last minute, Health, Indigenous Medicine and Nutrition Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne summoned the relevant team of doctors to Colombo for a special discussion and the doctors had promised to clear their problem and carry out the transplant surgery and the operation was carried out the very next day as promised.
The team of doctors were led by Cardio Thoracic Surgeons Dr. Anil Abeywickrema and Muditha Lansakkara, and Consultant Anaesthetist Dr. Jagathi Perera.
Sevvandi who was admitted to the operating theatre for the transplant surgery around 11 pm on September 26 was moved into the unit’s intensive care unit after the successful operation around 5 am on September 27.
