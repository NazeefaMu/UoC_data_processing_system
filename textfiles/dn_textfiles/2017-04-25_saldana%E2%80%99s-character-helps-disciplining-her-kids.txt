Saldana’s character helps in disciplining her kids

Zoe Saldana of Guardians of the Galaxy explained to E!News that her green body paint that she used for her character Gamora in the film, actually has positive effects at home, helping her discipline her three children into eating their veggies!
She says that earlier, they were too young to understand why she was green, now they’re wrapping their heads around it as their mother is taking on the avatar once again for volume two of the series. Recalling one of her son’s thought processes, she says, “Green, Gamora, Hulk?” is what they think.
Cy, Bowie and Zen are told that The Incredible Hulk will show up any moment and take their toys if they don’t obey their parents. With the so-called Hulk on their side, Perego and Saldana feel like they’re not outnumbered three to two.
“My husband never wastes any time in letting me know that soon I’m going to be the only one that’s going to feel (outnumbered) because once they become dudes, then it’s their father and the dudes, I’m just going to become the nagging mom that’s in their way,” shared Saldana. Agencies
