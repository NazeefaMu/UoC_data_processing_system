‘Cancer drug tender given to most qualified importer’

The tender for the cancer drug named Trastuzumab has been given to the most qualified importer and all relevant rules and regulations were followed when offering the tender, the State Pharmaceuticals Corporation (SPC) Chairman attorney-at-law Sarath Liyanage said in a statement.
In his statement, he said no tender board member resigned as stated in certain media reports, which is purely aimed at slinging mud on the SPC. Meetings were held with unsatisfied persons who did not receive the tender due to disqualifications.
“Nothing in the media reports is true. There is no connection whatsoever between the SPC Managing Director Dr. Rumi Mohammad and any drug company,” he said in his statement.
“Certain media reports published from time to time stated that Dr. Mohammad's relative is in a drug company. But this is not true at all and it is only a fabricated story publicized with the objective of slinging mud,” he said in his statement.
