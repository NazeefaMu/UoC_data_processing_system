‘Harry is a real hero’

A compliment from sister-in-law:
The Duchess of Cambridge has praised her 'brilliant' brother-in-law Prince Harry for speaking out about his mental health struggles - as she hinted at battling with 'mixed emotions' after becoming a mother for the first time.Kate, 35, was speaking to Jamie Maloy, headteacher of Viking Primary School in west London, during a reception for London Marathon runners at Kensington Palace on Wednesday.
Mr Maloy lavished praised on the prince, saying: 'What I love is your brother-in-law talking the other day, because that's just ignited it.
'Everyone's talking about mental health now because someone who is so famous and so much in the public eye has actually turned around and said something hit me hard – the death of a close loved one. And I think people have gone "good on you, because you could have never mentioned that."'
When he told Kate how Harry was 'a real hero to a lot of people', she replied: 'Absolutely. He's been brilliant.'
The Duchess of Cambridge hosted the athletes running for Heads Together, the mental health campaign she launched last year alongside the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry, at her Kensington Palace home on Wednesday afternoon
The Duchess was hosting a group of athletes running for Heads Together on Wednesday, the mental health campaign she launched last year alongside the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry which has been chosen as the official charity for this year's race.
The princess also met DJ Neev Spencer who suffered post natal depression after the birth of her daughter, Genevieve, now nine months.
Kate told her: 'Nothing can prepare you for motherhood - especially the first time round, the mixed emotions.'
The Duchess has spoken candidly in the past about suffering from a 'lack of confidence' as a first-time parent, calling motherhood a 'huge challenge'.
Today, the mother-of-two opted for an uncharacteristically dressed-down look with a £220 striped top from Italian label Luisa Spagnoli, skinny jeans and her trusty Superga trainers as she welcomed the runners to her London residence - a far cry from her ultra-polished look during her last public appearance on Easter Sunday. - Daily Mail
