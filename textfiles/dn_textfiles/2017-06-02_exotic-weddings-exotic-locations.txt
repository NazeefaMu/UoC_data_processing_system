Exotic weddings, exotic locations

The monsoon breeze that blows through the country accompanied by pleasant weather during the month of May sets the perfect backdrop for a fairytale wedding. Blessed with an abundance of landscapes within a few hours of travel, Sri Lanka has become globally renowned as one of the top destinations for exotic weddings.
The fifth month of the year is traditionally considered the beginning of wedding season around the world and many brides (and grooms!) are determined to tie the knot in May.
The colonial architecture of the cottages and acres of lush green tea plantations kissed by the clouds make for an ideal location for an outdoor wedding. Royal Cocoon in Nuwara Eliya possesses just the right location, coupled with the ability to cater impeccable delights and unmatched hospitality ensures that the details of your perfect wedding are well taken care of.
Royal Cocoon situated in close proximity to the world famous botanical gardens in the hill country is a haven for those who wish to have an intimate gathering. The landscaped gardens can comfortably accommodate a crowd of 100. Any time of day is ideal for the ceremony as the temperature hardly reaches above 20 degrees, but locals will tell you that early morning or and afternoon tea-party is the best. In fact the tea party concept has become increasingly popular in recent times as it brings to life an authentic British garden wedding. The location presents you with sights of endless landscapes, valleys and hills existing in perfect harmony with the climate, vast water bodies and many more.
The best part for couples is that once the ceremony is complete the exquisite honeymoon suite is literally a few steps away. Cozy rooms complete with in-room heating, en-suite bathrooms and a plush king-size bed are available for the taking.
