GMOF letter, newspaper articles will be handed over to CID: Rajitha

The <U+200B>letter sent to Health Ministry Secretary Anura Jayawickrama by the Government Medical Officers' Forum (GMOF) <U+200B>and the newspaper articles published on it will be handed over to the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) for further investigation. Even the state media published false news items, Health Minister Dr. Senaratne said.
Minister Senaratne was addressing a media briefing held at the health ministry recently.
The minister said media personnel should check with Health Ministry officials before publishing such news. The person who signed the press release will be investigated. I have his details and he had taken money to publish the news item. This is shameful. Minister Senaratne said the GMOF had sent a letter to Health Ministry Secretary Anura Jayawickrama requesting him to safeguard the good name of the Health Minister and conduct a comprehensive and an independent inquiry into the issue of State Pharmaceuticals Corporation (SPC)'s current Managing Director's unethical and irregular practices<U+200B><U+200B>. This is purely aimed at disparaging the MD's character.
There is no such organisation at the given address; only a deserted house and the guard there said the owners live in the UK.
Senaratne said the persons who accused Dr. Rumie Mohamed<U+200B> are connected to a private company which lost a tender recently due to its corruption and malpractices. The company changed the name and re-registered as a new company under a new address after angaing in nifarious activities.
The owner of the company was in remand custody for six months. He had imported drugs from a place in India. There is a flower shop, not a drug company. He tried to import a drug for cancer at Rs. 170 million. `I stopped it and saved a large sum of money for the Health Ministry,' Senaratne said.
