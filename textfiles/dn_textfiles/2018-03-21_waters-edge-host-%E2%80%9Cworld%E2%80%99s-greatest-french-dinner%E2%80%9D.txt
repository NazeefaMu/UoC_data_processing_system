Waters Edge to host “World’s Greatest French Dinner”

Waters Edge will be one of five venues in Sri Lanka celebrating the famed 4th Goût de France or Good France on the 21st of March 2018. Dubbed the “World’s Greatest French Dinner”, Good France is a unique global event held in over 150 countries involving hundreds of chefs and restaurants. Each venue will offer authentic French Menus prepared using traditional ingredients and methods.
“France is the birthplace of the Michelin guide and is often considered the root of most cuisines in the world. It gives Waters Edge great pleasure to be a part once again in this historic event. It also gives us the opportunity to showcase the culinary prowess of our international award winning culinary team”, said culinary guru and General Manager of Waters Edge Rohan Fernandopulle.
The event was a huge success in Sri Lanka and Maldives last year. This year’s Waters Edge rendition of fine French cuisine will be curated by the award-winning Executive Buddhika Samarasekera, who is the only chef from Sri Lanka to win Bocuse d’ Or Asia and compete in French cuisine against some of the best chefs in the world at Lyon, France.
Chef Buddhi has also gathered experience from Michelin Star restaurants across the world including Paris.
He is also a part of the culinary Olympics Sri Lankan team and is considered a maestro in French Gastronomy.
Adding to the hotel’s culinary prowess Sous Chef Chamaka Perera was Selected as the all island winner of Bocuse d’ Or Sri Lanka and is currently preparing for Bocuse d’ Or Asia in China.
Together with their team, these two will put together a 7-course sit-down dinner reminiscent of those prepared for the French aristocracy of the bygone days.
Some 3,000 participating restaurants including 1,500 chefs will also pay tribute to French Culinary Masetro Paul Bocuse who has been called the greatest chef of all time. Bocuse passed away recently leaving behind a legacy for the culinary arts.
According to Alain Ducasse, the Michelin 3-starred French chef and president of the event participating chefs can choose to include one of Paul Bocuse’s dishes or a dish inspired by him in their menus.
The Waters Edge Menu for the event will include a carefully curated menu.
