Keith Noyahr abduction and assault case: Suspects further remanded

 The suspects in the Keith Noyahr case were further remanded by the Mt.Lavinia Additional Magistrate after the CID made detailed submissions relating to the abduction and assault case of the journalist.
The defence said that the this case was brought up in a hurry and there was no transparency in the investigations carried out seeking the court to intervene.
Thereafter,the CID came out with the available evidence and said that every thing points to the involvement of the suspects who are now in remand. Clues relating to Mr Noyahr’s abduction came to light when they were investigating the matter relating to the slain journalist Lasantha Wickrematunga and the assault case of Upali Tennekoon.
The CID said that the same team is responsible for all three incidents and sought an order to further remand them.
The magistrate while remanding the suspects till March 16 told the CID that an identification parade will be held on the same date and wanted the CID to make arrangements for Mr.Noyahr to be present in Court on that day.
