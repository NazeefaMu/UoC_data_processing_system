Wild elephant menace, a hinderance to children's education

Wild elephants from the Ampara district invade villages such as Addalaichenai, Palamunai, Ashraff Nagar, Hira Nagar, Meelath Nagar and Sambu Nagar in search of food and residents live in fear.
These elephants enter villages and destroy paddy fields, home gardens and other arable crops, while the daily income of the people have also been considerably reduced.
Due to this situation, parents complain that the education and academic activities of their children are affected badly.
Earlier, elephants enter villages only during night time. But now they enter these villages even during day time.
During day time when school children are studying in their class rooms, elephants enter the school premises in herds, thereby the education of the children is jeopardized.
In December this year, the GCE Ordinary Level examination would be held, but these students are unable to prepare for their examinations due to the wild elephant problem.
In order to chase these elephants out of residential areas, villagers engaged in chasing these elephants by setting fires at various points of the village.
