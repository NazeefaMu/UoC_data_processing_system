ACL Cables PLC was ranked 41 amongst the Top 50 Valuable Brands for 2017, a continued ascent from last year's ranking.
Advancing seven positions, the company has received a ranking of 41, compared to its rank of 48 last year.
The ranking recognises ACL Cables's improved brand value and ratings when compared to previous years. A significant achievement for the brand has been the scaling up of 19 places in the last two years.
This is the second successive year ACL Cables has been ranked amongst the Top 50 Valuable Brands and impressively is the only cable manufacturer to do so demonstrating its market leadership within the category. Additionally, ACL is ranked third amongst the building material category, and placed as the No. 1 most valuable brand in the category of cables.
The annual brand rankings is compiled by Brand Finance, and presented by Media Services. Ratings are calculated on brand strength, which is the part of the analysis that is most directly influenced by those responsible for marketing and brand management.To determine the strength of a brand they develop a Brand Strength Index (BSI)which analyses marketing investment, brand equity (goodwill accumulated with customers, staff and other stakeholders) and their impact on business performance.
ACL Cables long-term commitments in marketing and brand management have contributed towards this improvement.

ACL as a brand has witnessed extensive progress during the past years; especially the last two years, scaling up 19 notches and being amongst the Top 50 Most Valuable Brands is a remarkable achievement.”
“We believe this is a result of our considerable investments in brand building and brand awareness activities. We built a strong brand campaign with our core cable product ‘Fireguard'. This has paved the way to reach our target audience, especially our consumers. We also made considerable brand investment activities to encourage dealer engagement and point of purchase awareness resulting in rich dividends,” he added.
