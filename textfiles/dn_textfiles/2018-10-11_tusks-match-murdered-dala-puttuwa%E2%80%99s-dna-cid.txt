Tusks match murdered Dala Puttuwa’s DNA - CID

The pair of tusks suspected to be from the murdered elephant Dala Puttuwa match the DNA in the animal’s body parts, the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) told court yesterday. The case was being heard before Mahawa Magistrate Shashika Mallawaarachchi.
The CID said they are yet to receive DNA reports of the ivory necklaces and rings suspected to have been made using the murdered elephant’s tusks.
