Ashwin first Indian bowler to top ICC's year-end ranking in 42 years

 
NEW DELHI: After bowling outstandingly well throughout the year, Indian off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin ended the year 2015 as the top ranked Test bowler in ICC rankings, released on Thursday.
This makes the Chennai spinner first India bowler since Bishen Singh Bedi in 1973 to achieve the feat of finishing the year on top.
Mainstay of the Indian bowling line-up, Ashwin took 62 wickets in nine Tests this year, including 31 scalps in the four matches against South Africa in the Freedom series.
Ashwin recently achieved the number-one spot for the first time in his career, replacing injured South African Dale Steyn. The Proteas fast bowler could only bowled 3.5 overs in England's second innings in the Durban Test.
In fact, its a double delight for the 29-year-old Indian tweaker, who also ended the year as top-ranked Test all-rounder.
Indian all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja finished the year at sixth position.
For the records, Ashwin and Jadeja are the only two Indians in the top 10 rankings of the Test bowlers.
