Mihin plane had to be pushed onto tarmac – Witness

The bizarre occurrence of Mihin Lanka employees pushing a Mihin Lanka plane from the Airport Terminal to the runway was disclosed yesterday.
Former Mihin Lanka Ground Handling Manager Ingrid Kathline Guruge made this disclosure at the Presidential Commission investigating into alleged fraud corruption and misuse of public assets in SriLankan Airlines, Sri Lankan Catering Services and Mihin Lanka yesterday.
This happened because SriLankan Airlines had withheld the release of ground handling equipment to Mihin Lanka due to overdue payments.
Cross examined by Deputy Solicitor General Shanaka Wijesinghe, Guruge said a group of employees attached to Mihin Lanka Engineering Division had to physically push the plane on to the runway due to unavailability of ground handling equipment.
Although other flights were cancelled due to non availability of ground handling equipment, this plane could not be cancelled as it was a pre-booked flight.
She said Sajin Vaas Gunawardena functioned as Chief Executive Officer of Mihin Lanka during this period. She said eventhough a set of computer operated ground handling equipment made in Germany were imported for Mihin Lanka, they were operated by SriLankan Airlines employees and not Mihin Lanka employees.
