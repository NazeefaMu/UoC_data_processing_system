Virtuous  verses

The slim book of poems of 48 pages, going by the title Me and My Angel may suggest a dedicated poetry of the beloved of the poet, Ithayarasan, a retired educator of high ranking status. He had earlier brought out two books in Tamil. One is Meeralkal (poems) and Muranpaadukal (Short Fiction) Meeralkal may mean acts of violation and Muranpaadukal, Contradictions.
The writer comes from a Marxist family. Therefore, the terms are reasonably correct. This is a publication by Jeevanathi Publishers and its Chief Editor Kalamani Bharanitharan has written an introduction and an excellent analysis as the foreword is by senior lecturer in sociology at Yaalpaanam University, Rajesh Kannan (his name reminds me of a Hindi actor of yesteryear). There are 31 Marxist-oriented poems in this collection.
Instead of me giving my views, I think it is better if I translate some of his poems so that the reader in English would understand what Lankan Tamil writers think about the society at large and more particularly their immediate surrounding.
Unresponsive feelings
I am the soil feeling pride of the lush grass
Sprung today after yesterday’s rain
The minerals around and the solemn fragrance
Sweepingly sprinkle the colourful richness around
The embellishing neighbouring soil like me
Desires to speak with me
I could feel its every movement-
My thoughts and movements too
Would have been caught by its eyes
And yet our relationship continues
To be mere fondness
On a gloomy darkness of a waning moon
I was stolen.
It might be that pitched darkness had it
Made it possible the helplessness
0f my father and mother- but I was isolated.
With the hardened clay of soil
I was forcibly copulated
Thinking of happy dreams of me
That soil which spoke a silent language would
Have been sold in the international market
For a good price.
Destruction
Real eagles prick and prick
And decompose
The dreaming birds
That believing forever
The Spy stories
Enrapturing a dreamy sheet
In a remembering bed
Male Characteristics
She builds a house
He ties a Thaali
She bears a child
He bloats his stomach
She carries burdens like a donkey
He neighs as a horse
She remains patient
He invests in ignorance
She works hard without sleeping
Even when everything is She
Everything belongs to him Belongs to Him
Bridegroom
A bull bought for a fat sum
To fertilize
 
Bride
A Sacrificial Cow
With jewellery and goods
And herself
Footprints that write pain
Every footstep the hill county women
Steps in the tea garden
Writes the unsolved pages
Of their deplorable life.
The wound of the Vanni
Our land’s women
During the Vanni War
Forcibly raped carry
In their chests
The historical wounds.
Vision
Even in post-Mullivaaikaal
Thamil Nationalism
Is Pounded
Like Blinds Viewing
An Elephant
Castes
In Tamil Culture
The foul-smelling
Dirty Wastages
Cultural Revolution
Soora Padman and his brothers stand
As symbols of the centre of autoreactive
New Colonial Suppression
Sooniyam
Even for a little vibration of a tumbler
The wartime hearts of people
Thought it was a bomb blast
And yet in peacetime i
People are in pain
Without Sleep
In the silent zones.
In the above creative translations, I have tried to put the essence of what Ithayarasan says in his poems. I have selected only the simple ones. But there are more serious poems in this collection and they are a little difficult to translate and if attempted, the importance of primary words may be lost translation.
This is a welcome addition to selective meaningful collection of recent Lankan Tamil Poetry.
Bharaneetharan also must be congratulated for the cover picture for his imaginative creation.
