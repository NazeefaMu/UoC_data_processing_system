Calamander Unawatuna Beach  hosts new years eve event

Calamander Unawatuna Beach hosted new years eve event last week and the guests were treated to a spectacular display of lights, decorations and fabulous array of foods from all over the world. Navy drummers, dressed in shimmering Shalwar Kamese and golden turbans, treated the crowd, assembled on the beach side deck, with the heart stirring beat of their drums.
Two clowns complimented the fire eaters, devil dancers and Kandyian drummers too participated. Several competitions too were held along with a Queen of the Night catwalk.
First prize was awarded to a Sri Lankan beauty. First prize for the raffle draw was a fabulous opportunity to stay in Calamander Unawatuna Beach and Calamander Lake Gregory, with transport provided between the two hotels.
The guests and staff gathered by the beach to witness a spectacular display of fireworks with the crowning event for all the staff and guests, the launching of hot air lanterns into the inky blackness of the night sky.
Hundred of lanterns, silhouetted against the moonlight, sailed towards the full moon. In 2018, Calamander Unawatuna Beach, looks forward to another year of change and development and continued success, ensuring its future as the best beach resort down south.
