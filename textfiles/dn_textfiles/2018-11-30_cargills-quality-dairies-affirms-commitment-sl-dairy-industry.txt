Cargills Quality Dairies affirms  commitment to SL dairy industry

Cargills Quality Dairies (Pvt) Ltd, a subsidiary of Cargills Group, affirmed its commitment to the Sri Lankan dairy industry by continuously investing in the most advanced dairy facilities in the country.
Our dairy business, driven by Kotmale and Magic brands, is underpinned by a philosophy that aims to strengthen farming communities. Through such investments, we are honoured not only to contribute to Sri Lanka’s self-sufficiency in fresh milk, but also towards the health and nourishment of her people.
Operating out of world class production facilities, our dairy manufacturing plant boasts state-of-the-art technology, robust environmental management processes, and ISO certification for quality and food safety. This has allowed us to place quality and innovation at the forefront of our business, translating best practice into success, including market leadership in the dairy ice cream category.
Supplementing an unwavering commitment to quality and innovation, Cargills is dedicated to uplifting the lives and livelihoods of our network of thousands of dairy farmers across 5 provinces: Central, North Western, North Central, Western, and Northern. Convinced that an empowered dairy force is central to sustaining the dairy industry, Cargills has, for instance, assured its farmers of a steady income through the purchase of fresh milk, and supported the education of their children through Cargills’ Sarubima program. In fact, Cargills commitment to the local dairy industry extends even beyond its own ecosystem. When farmers outside the Cargills network in Ridiyagama in the Southern Province—were unable to sell their milk, for instance, Cargills stepped up to purchase large amounts of the surplus, towards cushioning negative fall-back on the industry.
Embracing this commitment, Kotmale and Magic aspire to be the most trusted dairy brands in the country. Over several years, the brands have won mass appeal for a distinctive product range which includes fresh and flavoured milk, ice cream, set and stirred yoghurt, drinking yoghurt, cheese, and fresh cream. Each of these products have been consistently defined by nutrition, freshness, and affordability. Further, by ensuring that our products are locally-sourced, the business recognizes the important role it plays in supporting the Sri Lankan economy—be it in uplifting Sri Lankan farmers, or in saving foreign exchange. It is this deep sense of responsibility that guides and drives our business.
Against this backdrop, Kotmale takes great pride in introducing its latest products: Kotmale Butter and Kotmale Cheddar Cheese. Through these products, we assure our valued customers of the highest standards of quality, freshness, and nutrition that have now grown synonymous with our brand. Defining features of Kotmale Butter and Kotmale Cheddar Cheese include:
It is, therefore, with much excitement that we invite you to be a part of this product launch today. We recognize that our achievements would not have been possible without your invaluable support. You carry our vision and commitment to the public and are, thus, critical partners in promoting and supporting the lives and livelihoods of farmers, the health and nutrition of consumers, and the strength of the Sri Lankan economy. For this we remain truly grateful.
As we continue to strive to bring you the best of Sri Lankan dairy, we encourage you to experience our butter and cheddar cheese. Products that stand as testament to our trusted and uncompromised quality; products that support Sri Lankan dairy.
