Maintain discipline in universities
According to newspaper reports, police have arrested 16 undergraduates who had been forcefully occupying the administrative block of the South Eastern University of Sri Lanka. These students are now in police custody.
The university has been made out bounds for the 16 undergraduates and students from the Faculty of Technology had staged a protest demanding that their fellow undergraduates be taken back without any conditions.
A group of students was subjected to the disciplinary inquiry over ragging several students in the university.
After the inquiry, the University Grants Commission UGC has decided to dismiss the studentship of four students in the Technology Faculty.
Discipline in universities has become a big problem. These students are given all the facilities free of charge. Tax payers are paying for their education.
Most of the tax payers in Sri Lanka are poor people. Some of them are living without any facilities. The university students are provided with all the facilities.
Go to a school in a village and see the facilities available. They do not have proper school buildings, proper classrooms, proper washrooms, proper canteen, proper library, required number of teachers.
However, the university students are provided with all these facilities free of charge. Tax payers are paying for their education.
In the case of private universities, parents are paying for their education. Sometimes several lakhs of rupees per year.
We should not allow these few indisciplined students to ruin the higher education of Sri Lanka.
We studied in the Peradeniya University about 40 years back. We also had problems. We never misbehaved like this. We respected our university teachers. We did not cut lectures. We did our practicals very well. We used the library facilities. Some of us were provided facilities to stay in halls. Some others were boarded in houses outside the university. We had financial problems. We had language problems. We had to repeat examinations. But we did not fight with the university management. There was discipline in universities.
We very kindly request the government and the university authorities to do everything possible to maintain discipline in universities. There are very few trouble creators, may be less than five percent. Please do not allow these trouble creators to ruin the university education of thousand others.
University administrators should be very firm. They should not get scared of students. They must do the right thing. Once a decision is taken, it should never be changed. All this is done for the benefit of the students, for the benefit of free education, for the benefit of our country.
University is not a place for some rude or mad students to come and play the fool.
It is a place to produce intellectuals to our society. Government, university teachers, university administrators and all other relevant parties should do their part to maintain discipline in universities. Forty years back we had that discipline. Let us re-establish it again.
