‘Siriwardane Pawla’ on April 24

 Rajitha Dissanayake’s latest play ‘Siriwardane Pawla’ (Siriwardane Family) will be staged at Namel Malini Punchi Theatre on April 24 at 3.30 and 6.45pm. ‘Siriwardane Pawla’ revolves around a young man who tries to become a popular star by competing in a TV reality show. The young man, Supun, and his family, consider this stardom to be a ticket to achieving a respectable place in a society where almost all other avenues of social mobility have been blocked.
Focusing on a single family’s dreams, the play highlights how the corporate media manipulates society. It also shows the predicament of those who pursue false ideals propagated by the media and how they lose their humanity in the process.
