Royal Royalist RODRIGO was a rare breed

In my previous column on great wicket keepers AKA as (stumpers), I featured BEN NAVARATNE and TELUS FERNANDOPULLE and mentioned that their ilks are not made but in the manner born.
This week I take readers down memory lane and on one of three more stumpers in MAHES RODRIGO. H.I.K. FERNANDO and RANJIT FERNANDO will follow. The trio were magnetic and like the two mentioned earlier they could have gloved for any world team.
Stumpers are specialists. All coaches of school and clubs would drill it into their captains that to get an insight as to how the wicket was behaving or playing was to seek the advice of the wicket keepers because they could read the wicket and advice the captain which bowler to bring on.
I had the fortune of coming under that great coach when I captained St. Benedict’s College in 1960 - BERTIE WIJESINHA. And he would insist that I consult the wicket keeper at all times who at that time was ALLAN GUNESEKERA looking every inch like former West Indian wicket keeper CLYDE WALCOTT aspiring to be in that class.
Rodrigo a Royal Royalist
To get back to former wicket keepers and I open with MAHESHA RODRIGO. RODRIGO a royal Royalist as they come was in addition to his excellent work with the gloves was a punishing opening batsman for Royal, Sinhalese Sports Club and All Ceylon as the representative team was then known.
To add to his cricketing feather in the cap, he studded another feather that of being a double international which was a rare breed in the 1940s and 1950s. As a ruggerite, RODRIGO was a master scrum half playing first for his school and then CR and FC and then captaining All Ceylon.
Ruggerite RODRIGO had the alacrity to get to the ball in a flash off as a scrum and pass the ball accurately to his stand off Ago Paiva who would set the line into poetic motion to score and win matches with ease. RODRIGO led his school and the country at rugby.
Cricketer RODRIGO played for the country from 1949 to 1952 and is best known and remembered for the unbeaten 135 he made opening the innings against the West Indies before running short of partners facing the ferocious pace of Prior Jones and John Trim.
Double international
The short and stocky RODRIGO with curly locks played 12 first class matches against Pakistan, West Indies, Commonwealth X1 and Marleyborne Cricket Club. He also had the rare opportunity of playing against Sir Don Bradman’s mighty 1947/48 team in a ‘whistle stop’ game making a stylish 26. RODRIGO certainly deserved the double international honour.
Talking of the Marleybone Cricket Club brings to mind the fun poked at them by the then Sports Editor of the ‘Daily Mirror’ the incomparable LawfordMartinus when seeing former England batting great Ken Barrington acting the clown on the field and not taking the game seriously was forced to poke fun and tag them the Marleybourne Cricket Clowns. In fun no doubt. I had the good fortune of coming under Martinus as a junior reporter.
When he fronted up to Bradman’s 1948 Australians RODRIGO could not keep wickets because Ben Navaratne stood behind. It is on record that RODRIGO fielding in the country took a spectacular catch to dismiss Sam Loxton which came in for high praise from former Aussie cricketer turned journalist Jack Fingleton.
Fingleton wrote thus: RODRIGO made a really great catch to dismiss Loxton in the outfield. probably RODRIGO found it difficult to sight the ball at first against the dark background but he brilliantly retrieved this initial error of judgement by taking a grand overhead catch in true baseball fashion. After watching him bat, Fingleton wrote: ‘ RODRIGO began to bat as if there was not the slightest venom in the Australian attack.
Very attractive batsman
‘He is a very attractive batsman,he uses his feet smartly to get into position and his bat is impeccably straight in defence. He is a good model for the young to follow.especially as he does not hesitate to give the loose ball all it deserves’, wrote Fingleton.
According to my former colleague the late Bernie Wijesekera in a tribute paid to the great sportsman on his demise said that, RODRIGO played cricket under the brilliant and crafty Derrick de Saram in the company of classy players like RusselHeyn, SargoJayawckrema, IversGunesekera, R..L..deKrester, S.Nagendra, V.G. Prins, M.Sathasivam, Bertie Wijesinha, SathiCoomaraswamy, Ben Navaratne, Malcolm Spittle, Lucien de Zoysa and C.V. Abayasekera to name a few..
Wijesekera further stated that RODRIGO never demanded respect but commanded it,which he duly received from everyone who was associated with him.His 80th birthday was celebrated in style at the ‘80 club’
In the midst of the gathering,shining out were golden oldies Bertie Wijesinha, and wife Doreen, Ian Pieris, and his wife Gunn, GaminiSalgadoe the 1942 Royal cricket captain, Summa Navaratnam,yet another die-hard old Royalist,also a ruggerite and once renowned as Asia’s faster sprinter and IfthikaCader to name a few.
Grand occasion
Joining him on this grand occasion were his charges U,L.Kaluarachchi, VijayaMalalasekera, Shaw Wilson, Chanaka de Silva, Malik Samarawickrema, JagathFernando,SusanthaRatnayake, DhammikaWedande, Ray de Silva, NalinPattikirikorale, Ana Wimaladharma, Dr. Fred Pereira and other vintage cricketers and ruggerites. RODRIGO passed away at the age of 84.
RODRIGO won his colours at cricket when just 16. He started off hoping to be a fast bowler. However it was destined that he be a wicket keeper. RODRIGO was made captain of Royal in his third year and one of his memorable achievements was when he captained the school to a one-run victory against Trinity. His captaincy came in for high praise. In the 1946 Royal-Thomian his batting was flawless although making scores of 48 and 35 not out.
It was not long before he sported SSC colours playing under Derrick de Saram. In one game SSC batsmen made merry making 530 for 2 in 1947 and RODRIGO made his first,first class century in. that game which saw four centuries, He scoring the first followed by de Saram, IversGunasekera and Bertie Wijesingha.
RODRIGO was a rare breed indeed.
