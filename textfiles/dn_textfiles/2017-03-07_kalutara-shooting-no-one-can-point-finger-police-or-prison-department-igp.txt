Kalutara shooting: No one can point finger  at Police or Prison  Department: IGP

IGP Pujith Jayasundera yesterday said that no one can point finger at Police or the Prison Department over the shooting at Kalutara, which left seven persons dead, including two prison officials.
“It is not fair to point fingers at either the Police Department or Prisons Department. We should collectively accept the responsibility,” he said.
Speaking at an event in Killinochchi yesterday, he said that there was a need to put in place a comprehensive plan to provide security to the black maria carrying prisoners from Kalutara to Kaduwela.
He said there may have been lapses on the part of the Kalutara Police OIC. “If he is unable to provide security to the prison bus, he could have taken instructions from the ASP or SP or SSP,” he said. IGP Jayasundera said the Police have taken measures to avert such incidents in future.
“We have decided to put in place a joint security plan to provide security to suspects who are allegedly involved in crime and underworld activities.
However, he refuted reports that crime is on the rise.
“Based on statistics, crime is on the decrease in the country,” he said.
