V Leaking Chemistry paper questions: Tuition master, his brother released on bail

The tuition master and his brother, who were alleged to have published leaflets containing questions from the 2017 G.C.E. Advanced Level Chemistry paper, were released on bail yesterday by the Gampaha Magistrate.
The Police arrested the tuition master after carrying out investigations into the distribution of the handout near a leading school in Gampaha which contained several questions that appeared in the exact form as in the second A/L Chemistry question paper.
A 19-year-old student was later arrested for allegedly leaking the Chemistry paper to the tuition master. The student's father too was arrested afterward for allegedly aiding in the crime. They were both remanded.
The Police said the father of the student suspect is a doctor at the Police Hospital in Narahenpita. It is alleged that the student used an electronic device smuggled into the examination hall to leak questions of the paper to his chemistry teacher while the exam was ongoing, in return for answers.
