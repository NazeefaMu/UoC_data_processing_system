Give them shelter
Mawanella is a large a populous town in the Kegalle District. The population around Mawanella may be about 40,000 people consisting of the three communities: Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims.
Mawanella is a commercial city where a large crowd visits the town for many purposes.
The people in the suburban villages come to Mawanella for many reasons: purchase goods for the daily consumption, to accompany children to schools, reporting to work, visiting the hospitals, banks and divisional secretariat. The common mode of transport is the bus, both state and private sectors. The main problem is that the people do not have a proper bus stand. The present bus stand (pictured) is in tatters.
In the case of a heavy rain, the commuters will be subject to much inconvenience.
This bus stand has been there for over 20 years without the attention of the authorities concerned.
Although Mawanella has been represented by numerous ministers, none of them seems to be interested in reconstructing the bus stand to cater to the visitors of the town.
As a regular visitor to the town by the public transport, I earnestly request the Parliamentarians who represent Mawanella and Kegalle District to reconstruct the bus stand by giving an attractive facelift at the earliest possibility.
