Magnificent living spaces with  skyline views at Elektra, Koswatte

Coming up in the fast growing Koswatte suburb of Greater Colombo, Elektra is a condo development project by veteran builder Foreat Homes. 
 The epitome of modernism, in combination with an at-home feeling, even in the sky, Elektra is a perfect blend of the new and the familiar, built upon a strong foundation of architectural and engineering excellence. 
 Situated at 30 Pipe Road, Koswatta, Battaramulla, Elektra comprises 153 apartments with private balconies that face your choice of either the Colombo skyline or open fields opposite, where calming greenery provides a wholly picturesque view. For those willing to invest in the best of both worlds, Elektra has a penthouse currently available that features a stunning 180-degree view that spans multiple settings.
A true haven for expression and creativity, and especially geared for young professionals seeking to carve out their own space in a bustling megapolis, Elektra will, once completed, boast the enviable honor of being the tallest structure in the Koswatte zone. 
 Importantly, all materials and customized fittings are sourced by Floreat Homes who guarantees they are of a superior, international standard.
 Meanwhile, the innovate design of the Elektra building itself promotes the use of sunlight and wind whenever possible to facilitate natural light and ventilation whenever possible. Additionally, its best in class apartment layouts place bathrooms and kitchens close to balconies, enabling the rapid evacuation of unpleasant smells.
 Elektra also offers up several modern conveniences such as parking on both the Ground and Third floors, which also includes a place to fix electric charging units, while entrances are on the Ground, First and Third floors to minimize waiting times. There are also two elevators and staircases, with one of each being fire proof for your added safety.
“Offering a prime location at an unbelievable price, Elektra provides a number of exciting modern amenities, from microwave ovens and washing machines, to wine cabinets and even cleaning robots. A great place to live and work, Elektra is the ideal space to call your own,” said, Charitha Nugawela, Director of Floreat Homes. 
 Elektra was designed by Thilan Koththigoda of KWA Architects, a registered Chartered Architectural practice with a wide portfolio of projects for private clients and developers in Sri Lanka and the Middle East.
