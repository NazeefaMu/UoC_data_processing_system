SAITM students between the devil and the deep blue sea: Parents

SAITM Private Medical Collage Parents’ Society President P.M.B.K.Thennakoon said they feel sad when they see their children study hard spending sleepless nights. Their marriages get delayed due to medical education. Efforts are being made to deprive them from getting the MBBS degree. They are waiting without achieving both goals, getting married and obtaining the MBBS degree, Thennakoon said.
Addressing a press conference at the BMICH, Colombo yesterday, he said that if anyone demands SAITM MBBS degree holders to sit for the Act 16 Examination, it will be a violation of their human rights. This examination is relevant only for foreign MBBS degree holders. There is no student among SAITM medical students, who does not have three simple passes at the A/L examination.
According to Thennakoon, there are about 300 students in the SAITM, who had been selected for state universities to follow other courses in the science stream except medicine. They did not go to state universities to follow degrees as they wanted to become doctors through the SAITM. In some state medical faculties, the subject `anatomy’ is handled by veterinary physicians. This is the standard of some state medical faculties, he said.
Thennakoon said the opportunity to receive education by paying money should not be blocked. All should respect the decision by the Court of appeal on the SAITM. Action should be taken against those do not respect the Judiciary. No one can call the SAITM `Hora Upadhi Kade’ (fake degree shop) as the Judiciary has accepted its legality.
