Swisstek (Ceylon) celebrates 50 dynamic years of business

08th August 2017, Colombo. Swisstek (Ceylon) PLC marked its 50-year business journey with a golden jubilee celebration. A five-time recipient of the prestigious Presidential Export Award for Excellence in the Wood sector, the industry pioneer’s journey has been a trailblazing one interspersed with significant milestones.
The Golden Jubilee celebration commemorated Swisstek’s dynamic history while longstanding employees of the company were felicitated and recognized at the event. The emblem marking its 50th anniversary was unveiled in the presence of dignitaries, guests, partners and well-wishers at the celebrations.
“Half a century ago Swisstek embarked on a mission. It pledged to exceed customer demands through quality products and fulfil the aspirations of its employees and shareholders. Fifty years later, the company has grown from its humble beginnings and continues to adhere to the highest quality and customer satisfaction. Swisstek has strengthened its core business and strategically expanded its product portfolio with the support and trust placed in the company by its stakeholders. Throughout its 50-year journey it has always remained proudly anchored to our inaugural vision,” commented Mr. Mahendra Jayasekera, Managing Director - Swisstek (Ceylon) PLC, about the company’s original mandate and business evolution.
Swisstek (Ceylon) PLC began in 1967 as the pioneer wooden flooring company in Sri Lanka. The company later evolved and expanded its core business from manufacture and sale of wooden flooring to manufacture and sale of Tile Grout and Tile Mortar, with a pulse on the needs of the market. It also supplies Decorative Pebbles, Skim Coat and Tile Cleaner products in its diverse product range while Aluminium products by its subsidiary are marketed under the brand name ‘Swisstek Aluminium’.
Swisstek has pioneered many firsts in Sri Lanka and has been recognized through numerous awards. Swisstek was the first company to introduce rubber wood to the international market in 1987 and 1996. It was the first company to obtain the Forest Stewardship Council certificate for the sustainable use of rubber wood.
“A constant focus on quality has been the guiding light of our activities. Our emphasis on quality manufacturing prompted technical collaborations with Bauwerk AG of Switzerland and has enabled us to keep abreast of changing markets and customer needs,” reflected General Manager, Mr. Dayal de Silva, Swisstek (Ceylon) PLC.
Formerly known as Parquet (Ceylon) PLC, Swisstek is a member of Lanka Walltiles Group of Companies since 2003 and exports to UK, USA, Australia, Europe and many parts of Asia. Over the years, Swisstek’s wooden flooring under the brand name, “Swissparkett” has been installed in several prominent locations and buildings around Sri Lanka such as the Kandy Municipality Sports Complex, La Fortress Hotel, Empire City Apartments, Royal Park Apartments, Cinnamon Lodge Habarana, Royal College Sports Complex and NSBM.
With abundance of success stories, awards and growth enriching the history of Swisstek, the company refuses to slow down as it is expecting to promulgate its existence in the years to come.
