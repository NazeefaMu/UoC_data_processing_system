‘Pichcha Mal Pooja’ on July 29

The 23rd ‘Pichcha Mal Pooja’ (offering of Jasmine flowers) will be held at the Ruwanweli Maha Seya and Sri Maha Bodhi premises on July 29 at 3 pm, Ven Kotapola Amarakiththi Thera said.
The Thera was addressing a press conference at the Information Department, yesterday.
The ‘Pichcha Mal Pooja’ is an annual pinkama organized by Shanthi Foundation with the assistance of the Presidential Secretariat, the Tri Forces, Sri Lanka Police and other public authorities.
The Thera said over 1.2 million devotees are expected to attend the ceremony and the Shanthi Foundation has already taken measures to provide basic facilities such as food, sanitary and healthcare for all devotees. “The ‘Pichcha Mal Pooja’ started as a small-scale religious activity in 1990 with only 150 devotees participating in the event.
"However, this religious programme had been expanded as a large-scale programme.
"A large number of devotees will participate from all over the country,” said the Thera.
The pinkama will be held with the blessings of Chief Incumbent of the Atamasthana Ven Pallegama Siriniwasa Thera and Chief Incumbent of Ruwanweli Seya Ven Pallegama Hemarathana Thera.
An office to receive Jasmine flowers, a first-aid office and an office for lost devotees will be setup at the Ruwanweli Seya premises.
Parents and elders are advised to give important telephone numbers to their children in case of any emergency.
