THE MATCHMAKER’S DAUGHTER

Short story:
I still remember an incident that happened in our village long ago. Asilin Nona was a middle-aged woman, a matchmaker who lived in our village. Her husband, Martin was a very lazy man who did nothing but sleep the whole day. He went fishing at the river, which flowed at the edge of our village when he felt like doing some work or when Asilin Nona started shouting at him. Yet, even there he would sit on a boulder or a protruded root of a big tree and after throwing the fishing rod into the water would start dozing. He hardly caught any fish. The urchins when passing him near the river used to sing.
“Martin Mama gala uda doyi - Malu patav bili piththe doyi”
(Uncle Martin is sleeping on the boulder; little fish are sleeping on his fishing rod)
Asilin Nona somehow managed to earn their bread and butter. She, being a matchmaker, was a good friend of the mothers who had young children of marriageable age. I can still remember her well, walking along the lane carrying an old black umbrella and a ‘pan malla’, the small woven bag in which she carried copies of horoscopes that she had received from prospective brides and bridegrooms. A mother had only to tell her what type of a person she was seeking for her son or daughter, when Asilin Nona would take out the bundle from her bag and sort out a relevant horoscope, be it a farmer, a trader or anybody who would suit the mother’s description. Then she would start praising the good qualities of the relevant family too. If the mother was not satisfied with that one, in no time she would produce another. She had so many with her, inside that small bag. However, only a few, less than even the number of fingers in one hand, were the number of marriages she had been able to arrange in our village.
Whether the horoscope tallied or not, the matchmaker had to be given some money for her services every time she visited you with a fresh marriage proposal. That was the income Asilin Nona had.
She was a regular visitor we too had, until we all got married, although the ones she brought up for us never materialized. When she came to our place, my mother used to treat her cordially as she always did for our villagers and neighbours. She was given something to eat and drink and while feeding on these she would feed my mother too about all the gossip in the village, would boast about the marriages she had been able to fix, how grand feasts they had at their wedding ceremonies and also how these marriages had all turned out to be very successful.
“You won’t believe Loku Nona,” she said addressing my mother. “They still treat me as one of their family members when I visit them. They still thank me for bringing them together in marriage.”
I never knew whether they were true or not since none whom I knew got married through proposals brought up by her.
There were rumours about her that she had helped runaway couples and that she could be bribed with money for carrying love letters. Once a neighbour of ours too complained to my mother about Asilin Nona helping her daughter to run away with a boy from the next village.
“Loku Nona, don’t let that viper, Asilin Nona step into this house. Don’t let your daughters get involved with her,” she said. “Look at what she had done. She had been helping Janakie (their daughter who ran away) all these days. In fact, she herself gave us the horoscope of that boy from the next village a few months back. We were not in favour with that since we had better prospects about our daughter and we had already arranged another marriage. We were kept completely ignorant of the affair between these two. Asilin Nona used to visit our place even after that proposal was rejected. She was friendly with Janakie too. We had no suspicions about them and knew not what they were planning behind our back. When they knew that we were not for that marriage, they have sought after Asilin Nona’s help to carry on the affair. Finally, when Janakie realised that we would never give our consent she ran away. Do you know that it was this damn woman who had carried away Janakie’s clothes out of our house?”
Yet Asilin Nona did not seem to be worried about such a thing. “All nonsense!” she had commented when somebody had asked whether she had any hand in that elopement.
However, our mother was very careful after what she had heard and never let any of us to be over-friendly with Asilin Nona.
Nanda was the daughter, the only child Asilin Nona had. She was neither a beauty nor a well-educated girl. The mother was travelling up and down with her “business” and the father although at home was sleeping the whole day. So Nanda just grew up just like any other village girl. She stopped schooling when she did not wish to attend school anymore. There was no one to comment for or against anything she did.
One morning, we heard a big commotion close the matchmaker’s house. Martin who hardly got up from his bed was coming down the lane wailing uncontrollably. Asilin Nona was behind him sobbing and shouting. She was using the most indecent words the villagers used at brawls. Without aiming at any particular person, she was abusing somebody, whom as she said, had been helping their daughter to take such a drastic step. We were wondering what it was when a villager passing our house told my mother, “Nanda had run away.”
“How we looked after our child?” shouted Asilin Nona. “She was the apple of the eye of both of us. Such an innocent girl! Never looked straight at a boy,” she cried pulling her hair and beating her chest and boasting what a blessing of a girl her daughter was.
A villager came out with the latest news then that Nanda had sent a scribbled note to her mother. It said, “You are a matchmaker. Yet, I am 34 years and still unmarried. I don’t need your services any more. I am going away with the one I had chosen.”
“I know who had helped her!” shouted Asilin Nona. A string of indecent, vulgar words poured out of her mouth. She ended up with wishing a thunderbolt to strike at the culprits.
No one either replied or pacified them. After shouting for a little while, they returned home. The scene was over.
“What a surprise! Nanda is thirty-four? Such a blessing of a girl as her mother says,” sarcastically commented my brother. “Asilin Nona, according to her is the most popular matchmaker and the one who could boast about such a number of successful marriages, could not find a suitable partner for such a girl like her own daughter.”
Janakie’s mother was also on the road. “It’s a boomerang. What she did to my daughter had come back to them,” she said turning towards her home.
However, everything ended satisfactorily since the next week itself Nanda returned home with her husband.
