Federation cautions against contestants with criminal records

The Lanka Federation of Self National Employees yesterday urged the Election Commissioner to take steps for issuance of a Police report and a Grama Seva Niladari's certificate for contestants at the local government election before they take oaths provided that they win the election.
Stating that 251 contestants of all parties in the Colombo District only have alleged involvements with crimes, the Lanka Federation of Self National Employees Chairman Sunil Jayawardena made the request by way of a complaint made at the Election Secretariat yesterday morning.
In his complaint, he stated that approximately 20 percent of the contestants islandwide were such persons who have involvement with crimes.
He added that some contestants have charges of heroin trafficking, illegal liquor trading, and some are prostitutes.
He added that if these persons were elected members, the Police would not be able to execute their duties and the activities of such persons would worsen.
He also said that some have connections even with Islamic extremist organizations locally and overseas.
He added that their association was ready to share their facts with the authorities.
