The champions will lift their game

Just 3 weekends to clock up or follow the chalk marks for that final under lights at the Havies international rugby bowl ..,as Dialog gets their silver ready ...designate the TV detail for the mega rugby night at Havelock Park....
I believe these last 3 crunch weeks will drag us thru a lot more mud and heaps more aches when the injury lists on both sides make difficult reading, and a lot to absorb, given the extreme pressure of a cup final.
The experts, our self appointed rugby pencil stats will finally see some daylight and probably mistake that for a radiant cosmic ball…from a generous divine fan up on mount Olympus...the herculean possibility, is mighty real and promises to exhaust the fans and players alike.
Havelocks have traditions to dutifully follow and yet another final, another season, another chance of guts and glory to wrap up a dramatic page in SRI rugby.
There is little doubt or the slightest hesitation from any player kit fit to play in the final....or for that matter, patched, ice bathed and massaged to rewire the mind and stand tall ...proper mental and body prep absolutely vital on every level to face-up up to the impressive upcountry lions in combat. Expectations and speculations like drizzling rain ...everybody consciously moved by the passage of play and drama, this season.
Finals are exasperating cauldrons of bubbling aggression, hope, and steel determination ...with no room for pre meditated retaliation or intent to knock any player out - there are written laws and codes, but greater unwritten codes that we stringently follow without question in the middle. The unwritten are inculcated from our first touch of the odd shaped pill…and carefully nurtured to maturity and adherence as we graduate the grades from school and club to country.
We learn that respect is fundamental to our existence and the essence of it all.
Today is such a long muggy day in Cinnamon Gardens…the city by the sea and recovery to stand and deliver…a Thursday print?
Let’s look at the reality and a few lines on the absolute quality of current rugby in SRI. Internationally we are among the top 5 in Asia at 15s, given our skill levels and ability to match the likes of Japan, Hong Kong and South Korea in the middle. If domestic club rugby is the litmus mark for class and quality …the same questions remain unanswered and have done for a decade at least. Basically our larger digits, the boiler house boys ...are several yards short on conditioning, endurance and leg power…especially in the last quarter. World rugby is dominated by teams that have incredible forwards who power up and decimate defences in the last 20 minutes of the game.,..providing an abundance of good ball for their specialist finishers to open up the encounter...the All Blacks are supreme at this and as world champions, intimidate and cause all manner of trouble to those who lack effective counter and efficient defensive planning.
Domestic rugby is grinding towards its league championship and big hand to Dialog the telecom giant, for its telling partnership with rugby …let’s hope their support and good thinking will shape our future ,,with obvious consideration for both the men’s and women’s 7s over the next two Asian season. Currently the men are 4th in Asia, and should have been 2nd or 3rd ...the women 7th …and should have been 4th …considerations by the parent body to establish a professional player friendly eco bloodline to nourish and nurture these young guns …who did their country proud ...winning the U19 and U18 Asian 7s cups in 2016.
They must certainly be the focus and investment for our skills future...giving them total support to grow in a performance friendly secure environment .that encourages intense preparation and effective mapping.
Will domestic rugby benefit from opening our island doors to expat players as we did with the 7s ...or stick to our stubborn home player’s only policy. IRB sanction for Hong Kong and Japan give them the luxury of choice and a compelling quality of player to challenge the best in world rugby….Japan beat South Africa in the world cup and at the Olympics 7s - ran past the All Blacks to make the quarters.
I am a firm believer in leading by example and sharing insight, experience, knowledge and strength …it’s valuable!
Finally let’s throw some light and ask a few questions …domestically - where is Jason Dassanayake …why is he not playing?
Will Danushka 'trytime' Ranjan (current 13 tries) score 20 or more tries in the league? Will Dulaj 'boots' Perera slot 200 points by the last game in the league (current 152 points) …Who will win the Dialog league cup …Havelocks or Kandy …keep in mind, the game is at Havelocks under lights ...enjoy the speculation and forecasts either on pure risk or sheer professional guesswork? After all, it is a 50-50 shot at the title …a two horse race and just 80minutes regulation time plus time added on if scores are level.
A delightful and enthralling fact about the result which means so much to all those whose lives are dedicated to quality and perfect finishing in the middle …its attention to detail and each of the team doing their job to their max, giving the coach plenty of options and some calm during the final ..knowing...under pressure his team are mentally tougher, fitter and able to absorb the forward power and still shape that Big Big W for his future..
Wishes to RJ for determination and focus despite the obstacles…persistence and attitude certainly the point of difference.
Both coaches will need plenty of calm and mental prep to sit through the next 4 weeks ...Ronny Ibrahim at Havies and Sean Wijesinghe the Kandy coach...both men are proud Kandyans ..true graduates of the game ...and embrace contrasting styles that are chalk and cheese.
The key for me is fitness, hunger to win, pride, and injuries to key players... come the final on 5 February at Havelock Park for a 6.30pm floodlit epic.
Top form to think we get to see the best warriors in Sri rugby platform their skills for us fans and those experts to crow and scream in admiration...players needs their supporters and the knowledge that their skills and courage are much appreciated, admired beyond the ocean.
Finals are the ultimate statement, a chance to make history and shine for the island to celebrate...its that time to translate all the months of graft and sweat into smooth outrageous skills the captivate the fans and stun the opposition..bula bula those with the magic and hit the charm on that day in the middle...its all on the day.
All told we are a small part our island nations glorious rugby history and can be proud of its future too. Cheers islanders.
