Parliamentary debate views will help formulate salutary constitution: Speaker

Parliamentarians’ views expressed during the three debates on the Steering Committee Report on constitutional reforms would help formulate a salutary constitution, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said.
He was addressing the media after participating in a religious function at the Salwana Buddhimalu Viharaya, Polgolla on October 28.
He said both sides have very knowledgeable parliamentarians and reaching a consensus through their ideas, views and criticisms would show true democracy.
He said the Government would never go against public opinion in framing a new constitution since the final decision is with the people.
The Speaker said the President and the Prime Minister had pledged to place the Steering Committee Report along with the decisions of the Parliamentary sittings as the Constitutional Assembly before the Mahanayaka Theras and the clergy of other religions before taking the next step.
The Speaker said that given this status, there was no need for anyone to create unnecessary problems in the country.
“If anyone is engaged in spreading false rumours about the proposed constitution when it had not been even drafted, it would be a severe attack on democracy.
The Speaker said that when the final Constitution was drafted, he would never give his consent if it spelled any harm to the country, people or Buddhism or any other community or religion.
He said that in his capacity as Speaker, he remained independent despite verbal onslaughts and criticism by various quarters.
