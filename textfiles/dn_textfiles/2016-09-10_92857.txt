Sri Lanka focusing on Green Sustainable Development
As envisaged in Maithri Palanayak manifesto
Sri Lanka is focusing on green sustainable development as envisaged in the Maithri Palanayak Election Manifesto, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament yesterday.
He said the government had already approved a Sustainable Development Council Bill and the same has been referred to Provincial Councils for their observations. He added that following their observations, the government could debate on it and pass the bill in Parliament, adding that following the bill being passed, the Sustainable Development Minister could come up with new plans for the future.
He made these observations moving the Ratification of the Paris Agreement on the United Nation's Framework Convention on Climate Change adopted in New York on May 09, 1992.
He said that he was happy that Parliamentarians take a keen interest on the matter and he should also explain as to why a change in Parliamentary business is needed to bring this forward.
“Global Climate Change has captured our attention during the last few decades. The United Nations adopted the framework at the Convention on Climate Change in 1992. But the problem was that the countries could not agree to the steps to be taken. We can see how long it had taken for global countries to come into an agreement. The problem was that, developed countries did not need to control the emission as they thought their own development process would be affected, Premier Wickremesinghe said. “We are well aware that during the last two centuries, the the industrial revolution, the rapid development of the world economies, the World War 11, use of atomic weapons, the test on nuclear weapons, etc. have made a significant impact on the Global Climate Change. Therefore,concerning the Climate Change, the expected 1.5 to 2 Celsius degree increase is getting exceeded. As I told you earlier, the waters of the Mahaweli river could get affected, while tea cultivation too could be affected. Due to this reason, there had been many meetings held, while last was in Copenhagen which also ended without reaching any agreement despite the efforts made as many countries were looking at their own interest.”
He said that it was possible for a country to develop fast, while controlling its emissions. “We are happy that Europe and Japan took the lead on these matters. However, the Paris Climate Talks last year reached a decision. I won't say that I was 100 percent satisfied with it, but it was a great leap forward. Now the process of ratification has commenced. For ratification requires fifty five percent of the countries with 55 percent of the global emission to ratify the agreement for it to come into force. Although many countries have agreed to it, there are still issues in some of the western countries and also in some of the Asian development economies. While they agree to control emissions, these are major issues coming up when they face the forthcoming elections in western countries this year and next year,” Premier Wickremesinghe said.
He said in this background, it gave us great encouragement that the President of the United States of America and the President of China agreed to ratify the agreement prior to the G 20 Meeting. “Following it, many countries and parliaments have decided to go ahead to ratify the agreement. Sri Lanka is concerned that President Maithripala Sirisena's manifesto agreed to take all necessary measures to protect the environment. The President has taken over the Environmental Ministry and had taken many measures to protect the environment. So, we have a great responsibility to ratify this agreement. Sri Lanka has the ambition for rapid development, however it should be a green development.
The government has already approved a Sustainable Development Council Bill. It has been sent to the Provincial Councils. I have asked the Provincial Council Minister to expedite the process so that we could debate it and pass it here. Later, we could take other necessary measures. In this background, we have to ratify it quickly, by ensuring that at least by the time the UN General Assembly meets, there would be ample ratifications at the November meeting this year by the time this agreement would come into force. We had discussed this matter with President Maithripala Sirisena. We felt that Parliament should ratify this agreement before President Maithripala Sirisena's visit to New York for the General Assembly in November. This is the last week that we could sit before the President's visit to New York”, Premier Wickremesinghe said. “So we moved this agreement.”
Strike unfair after agreeing to requirements
Making a special statement in Parliament yesterday with regard to the Labour officers’ strike, State Minister of Labour Ravindra Samaraweera, said it was unfair to hold a strike after coming in to an agreement with the relevant authorities with regard to the fulfillment of their requirements.
He made this statement as a response to a request made by SLFP MP Dinesh Gunawardane and Chief Opposition Whip MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake on Thursday (8), requesting the government to intervene on behalf of the Labour officers’ strike.
The State Minister said that Labour officers are demanding for the promotion of all labour officers from their current salary scale of MN -5 to SL-01. But according to the Labour officers, it is necessary to face an examination after the completion of a 10 year service period as a Labour office to the salary scale of SL-01 which is the current salary scale of an Assistant Labour Commissioner.
After recognizing the necessity for restructuring the Labour Department, a committee was appointed by the Labour Minister to look in to matters and submit a report within three months. Various ideas and proposals have been received to the committee by various groups.
In line with this process of seeking ideas and proposals, Labour officers also emphasized the necessity of making a service minute and they submitted a draft of earlier prepared service minute namely “Sri Lanka Labour Relations Service,” to the Labour Minister as well as to the Commissioner General of Labour. According to this proposed minute, Labour officers demand that they be placed the SL-01 salary scale.
But during discussions held among representatives of the Labour Officers' Union, Labour Ministry and Labour Department, it was decided to complete the service minute after completing the restructuring process of the Department. But the Labour Union urged the government to certify the proposed service constitution as soon as possible. So a committee comprising officers of the Labour Ministry and Labour Department was set up to work out details.
“We informed the Labour Officers Union, that the Labour Ministry of the Department could not work on this alone and it was necessary to get the approval of the Public Administration Ministry, Management Services Department and Public Service Commission. But on September 9, the Union informed the Commissioner that they were to hold a continuous strike,” he said.
The State Minister said that another discussion was held under the patronage of Labour Minister W.D.J. Seneviratne, which had taken three decisions and the Union had agreed with the minister to give a three month period to fix the proposed service minute after completing the restructuring process within three months. Even after it came to this agreement, the Union sent another letter to the Commissioner General of Labour claiming that they were to hold a strike on September 7. It was unfair to hold a strike after coming in to an agreement.
Interchanges on Expressway constructed not adhering instructions
A new interchange at Bombuwala is being considered for the Southern Expressway, said Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella. He was responding to a proposal made by JVP MP Nalinda Jayatissa during oral questions.
JVP MP Nalinda Jayatissa alleged that some interchanges of on the Southern Expressway have not been placed properly due to political influence.
'Certain political parties sabotaging moves to introduce new electoral system'
Certain political parties are involved in crippling the government's moves to introduce new electoral system, Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Youth Front Chairman Shantha Bandara said.
He was addressing a media briefing at the SLFP Headquarters yesterday.
"Both Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra and Duminda Silva were victims of this twisted election system. Therefore, it is our responsibility to help change the current preferential voting system and replace it with an mixed electoral system that ensures representation of individual members for Parliamentary constituencies, with mechanisms for proportionality," Bandara said.
"It will take some time to have a new electoral system in place that do not lead to clashes and ensuring greater democracy. Although we also supported the passage of the Local Government Amendment Bill in 2012, there are still 17 more amendments to be implemented," he said.
Condemning the attack on Sri Lanka's High Commissioner in Malaysia, he said that the Youth Front vehemently condemns the attack. The Youth Front urges both the Sri Lankan and Malaysian governments to show the world that they will not tolerate any vestiges of terrorism. Both governments should also act to end all forms of terrorism.
He said the SLFP Youth Front is organising itself in a discipline and orderly manner identifying various shortcomings and also other factors that can improve the SLFP.
"We are making the youth aware about the major force is being built around the party led by the country's youth. We will show the results of this at a nation wide election. The SLFP's 65th Convention was a great success," he said.
The party rank and file had some initial doubts with regard to President Maithripala Sirisena taking over the SLFP Chairmanship. Earlier, all SLFP Chairpersons were elected as Presidents with the full backing of the party. But this time, President Sirisena did not have the full backing of the party when he became the SLFP Chairman.
"The President became a Common Candidate with the assistance of other political parties such as UNP, JHU, JVP and Civil Society organisations," he said.
"President Sirisena addressing the 65th SLFP Convention said that he was determined to make the party stronger and not weaken it. He further said that the SLFP will contest the upcoming Local Government polls under the SLFP's traditional 'Hand' symbol. He also promised to give leadership to form a future SLFP Government at this convention," Bandara said.
Climate Change, Global Warming leading to environmental challenge
Climate change and Global warming is the leading environmental challenge in this Century, Chief Government Whip and Mass Media and Parliamentary Reforms Minister Gayantha Karunathilake said.
He was participating in the Adjournment Motion on the Paris Agreement on Climate Change in Parliament yesterday.
The minister said achieving the targets mentioned in the Paris Agreement would help to arrest global temperature rise which in turn would help protect the health of the people and eco-system stability. He said Sri Lanka could make an active contribution towards this end.
He reminded that Sri Lanka ratified to the Paris Agreement on April 22 along with 178 countries. He said Sri Lanka is now making plans to achieve the stipulated targets within the stipulated timeline.
Joining in the debate MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena pointed out that meeting the stipulated targets of the Agreement before the given deadline of 2030, could have an impact on the country’s development.
However, he said the full support of the Joint Opposition would be extended to implement the Agreement. He also emphasised the need to harness potential of the solar, wind and water resources to generate power. “Our country is full of solar and wind energy. However, we are yet to harness them in the proper manner,” he said.
He also said that researches had warned that one billion people in the Asian region would suffer from water scarcity in another 30 years. He reminded that safe drinking water sources are fast shrinking in the world.
