Many fruitful measures taken for people’s benefit: Govt aims a healthy nation: President

The government's policy is to strengthen the health service aiming a healthy nation, President Maithripala Sirisena said in Warakapola yesterday.
He said the government allocated more budgetary allocations this year compared with the previous years.
President Sirisena said accordingly, Rs. 260 billion has been allocated for the health sector this year.
The President made these comments after commissioning a newly constructed fully equipped six storied clinical ward complex at the Warakapola Base Hospital yesterday.
The new clinical ward complex consisting of three theatres, an ICU and a labour room along with 315 beds has been constructed at Rs. 1,103.7 million allocated jointly by JICA and the Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council.
President Sirisena said the new hospital is one of the four fully equipped hospital projects carried out in the country with financial assistance from JICA.
The service at this hospital, situated close to the Colombo – Kandy, will not be limited to the Kegalle district. When considering its geographical situation, it serves the entire country, he said.
The President noted that even if the government takes measures to improve physical resources in hospitals, it is up to the medical and other staff to provide a quality medical service.
President Sirisena said he faced much difficulty when strengthening and establishing good governance.
“Right after the presidential election victory, the then highest ranking officer of the judiciary came to me and requested not to remove him from his post,” he said
“He told me that he was ready to work as I wish. I told him that such a decision has not been taken yet. He came again the following day with the same request. I then decided to remove him as he was not suitable for the judiciary system. With this incident I was amazed, how decisions were obtained during the last regime,” the President said.
He added that the government’s aim is to create a peaceful and strong country in which anyone can live happily and peacefully.
"The government will never allow to destroy ethnic harmony, even though certain narrow minded politically motivated persons are aiming to destroy ethnic harmony."
President Sirisena said the government has taken many fruitful measures for the benefit of the people. The President said under the Moragahakanda Kaluganga development project, 400 tanks are renovated while another 300 tanks are renovated under the Wayamba irrigation scheme.
