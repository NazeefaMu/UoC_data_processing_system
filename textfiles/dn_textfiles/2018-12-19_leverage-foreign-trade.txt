Assessing Economic Development:
LEVERAGE OF FOREIGN TRADE

The country’s performance on the global value chain is assessed through the volume and nature of transactions on the BOP. All receipts and payments on transactions with foreign countries are compiled in the BOP. Foreign currencies underlying those transactions are traded in the foreign exchange market against Rupees. The BOP could be a surplus or a deficit. The surplus increases the supply of foreign exchange in demand for Rupees. The deficit results in the opposite. Accordingly, key indicators reflecting the BOP to assess the leverage of foreign trade for the economy’s development are the current account balance, exchange rate and foreign reserve of the country
Last three articles in this series covered key macroeconomic indicators relating to national production, labour market and fiscal sector and what they reflect on economic development of the country since 1950s. This article outlines key indicators relating to the foreign sector of the economy.
In modern globalized world, no country can escape from foreign transactions and governs the economy. Trade in goods, services and capital/investments is the foreign sector which has been existent from ancient times in different modes, volumes and magnitudes. Foreign trade facilitates countries to import resources, produce, generate employment and export for more income.
Old economics believed countries to be endowed with natural resources to produce and export. However, new technology and global financial system facilitate countries to produce and export beyond their resource base through imports and invention of resources that were never thought of. Therefore, countries which can improve the competitiveness/comparative advantages can achieve economic development from the globalization that provides the global value chain for countries to produce and trade. Real world experiences in development of countries through the global value chain are abundant.
The economic ideology and policy before 1977 in Sri Lanka were the closure of the economy to foreign countries through control of imports and foreign exchange and import substitution. In contrast, since 1978, the economic policy has been the trade liberalization in different magnitudes to tap the global value chain. There is no dispute over economic opportunities and improved living standards that the country enjoys from new policy initiatives although Sri Lanka is way behind the most of peer countries.
International Balance of Payments (BOP)
The country’s performance on the global value chain is assessed through the volume and nature of transactions on the BOP. All receipts and payments on transactions with foreign countries are compiled in the BOP. Foreign currencies underlying those transactions are traded in the foreign exchange market against Rupees. The BOP could be a surplus or a deficit. The surplus increases the supply of foreign exchange in demand for Rupees. The deficit results in the opposite. Accordingly, key indicators reflecting the BOP to assess the leverage of foreign trade for the economy’s development are the current account balance, exchange rate and foreign reserve of the country.
BOP Current Account Balance
The sum of net positions in trade of goods and services, factor income and remittances is the current account balance. Factor income comprises wages, interest and profit/dividend involved in utilization of cross-border labour, land and capital. Remittances are the cross-border grants.
In old economics, trade balance, i.e., exports less imports of goods, is considered as the core that reflects the strength of production and competitiveness of the country. In modern economics, all goods, services and factor income are equally important for development. For example, tourism, IT services, financial and professional services and migrant labour are good sources of generation of foreign income. A country dependent on foreign capital has to pay interest and dividend in return for their contribution to local economy.
The current account deficit means that the country imports foreign resources in goods and services for its production activities more than it exports. Any deficit has to be financed by inflow of foreign capital (borrowing and direct investments). Countries like the US can run deficits by paying out from own currencies such as US dollar being global reserve currencies. Therefore, such countries have to run deficits to enable other countries to earn reserve currencies to be used for international payments and reserves.
In contrast, a surplus in current account means real resources/foreign exchange earned from exporting resources and invested back in foreign countries, for example, China, Europe and East Asian Countries. Such investments confront various risks. Both high deficits and surpluses are the sources of macroeconomic risks emanating from foreign economic shocks to individual countries. Therefore, it is prudent to run a low rate of surplus or deficit in order to maintain a sustainable level of development of the economy.
Deficit is favourable at developing stage of a country to import foreign resources required for the development. However, if the country is unable to develop to earn a sustainable surplus within a decade or two, the deficit will be a structural problem that will end up in a foreign debt problem. As borrowing finances businesses, a country does not have to worry of current account deficits per se if it maintains the investor confidence with routine flow of foreign capital and competitiveness.
In macroeconomics, high and protracted current account deficits are attributed to high budget/fiscal deficits that have to be financed from import of foreign resources. Accordingly, economists recommend governments to cut-down fiscal deficits to fix the problem of current account deficits. The Monetary Board also has specific powers to implement monetary and exchange policies to promote the BOP in the national economic interest.
The level of current account is assessed as a percentage of GDP as it is one component in the domestic expenditure or the total value of domestic production (GDP).
Exchange Rate
Exchange rate is the price between two currencies, i.e., foreign currency and local currency. In Sri Lanka, US dollar (US$) is the major foreign currency used for international transactions and, therefore, exchange rate for US, Rs/US$ (Rs. Per US$), is reflective of the BOP outcome. In mostly liberalized countries, surplus or deficit in the BOP determines the exchange rate. The deficit is the excess of demand for foreign currency than its supply and appreciates or raises the value of the foreign currency (local currency depreciates). The surplus causes the opposite.
In macroeconomics of globalization, the exchange rate shows the international economic competitiveness of countries. The local currency appreciation is an indication of the economic strength and competitiveness of a country in global trade that generates surpluses in the BOP. In countries like Sri Lanka, the local currency always tends to depreciate as the current account is a big deficit. Therefore, foreign capital inflow is necessary to keep the currency stable in value. Foreign capital (such as investments in government securities and stocks) being mostly short-term and volatile is the major source of exchange rate fluctuations as well.
Many countries use policy interventions to keep the local currency low-valued/depreciated in order to encourage exports and foreign receipts as it raises the amount of local currency on receipts of foreign currency. Even China being the country with world’s largest foreign reserve of nearly US$ 3.1 trillion attempts this policy, despite the protest of the US and Europe which run trade deficits with China. However, such exchange rate policies alone do not support the development and competitiveness unless the macroeconomic policy framework is supportive for improvement in international competitiveness of the country.
Academic economists use calculations of effective exchange rate indices (nominal and real) to assess the country-competitiveness. However, these indices have limited use due to problems involved in underlying statistics and calculations and, therefore, no policymakers take economic policies based on interpretations of these indices.
The Monetary Board is responsible for maintaining the exchange rates of Rupees consistent with the underlying trends in the country to assure free use of Rupees for current international transactions.
Foreign Reserve
Foreign reserve is the official foreign reserve held by central banks as a cushion to protect the currency and to finance BOP deficits. The reserve is built from purchase of foreign exchange from the market as and when the BOP runs surpluses. Therefore, the foreign reserve of competitive and growing economies should increase over the period, for example, China and East Asian Countries.
Almost all countries use their foreign reserves to intervene in or control the exchange rate in order to avoid unhealthy fluctuations. For this purpose, central banks buy foreign exchange from the market to avoid unhealthy currency appreciation while sell foreign exchange out of reserve to minimize currency depreciation. Such intervention is a price control system based on a buffer at a cost. However, since the foreign reserve of many countries is limited due to current account deficits, currency protection requires reserve buffers maintained on regular foreign borrowings.
In general, the strength of the foreign reserves is measured by the number of months of imports if financed by only use of the reserve. This is an old trade-based indicator used during controlled economies. Nowadays, foreign reserves are required to cushion against short-term capital outflows and current account deficits. This is intended to prevent default on foreign payments and to protect the stability of the currency/exchange rate. Therefore, the adequacy of reserves relative to current account deficit plus short-term foreign capital liabilities is the most appropriate measure. Accordingly, the foreign reserve should be held in safest foreign assets as the reserve is not meant for risk-taking trades/dealings or portfolio management to seek profit.
The Monetary Board is responsible for holding a foreign reserve adequate to meet any foreseeable deficits in the BOP. For this purpose, it can adopt monetary, banking and exchange policies to enable it to purchase more foreign exchange from the market.
Economic Story from Numbers
Official numbers of all three indicators show poor competitiveness in international trade and high vulnerability of the country to foreign sector and debt. However, there is no dispute over the expansion of economic activities, employment and living standards due to liberalized foreign trade and investments.
l Current Account
The current account has mostly been a deficit which has considerably increased after 2005. With the commencement of trade liberalization in 1977/78, current account deficit increased to over 10% of GDP in early 1980s due to imports and fast-tracked development projects. Although the deficit declined to around 2%-4% of GDP in later decades, the country’s growth and BOP have not improved due to poor international competitiveness.
* Exchange Rate
Exchange rate was under a price control system up to the end of 1977. Although it was allowed to be largely determined in the market since 1978, the Central Bank (CB) has been aggressively intervening in the exchange rate through various monetary and exchange regulations and buying and selling of foreign exchange. Therefore, exchange rate does not reflect the performance or competitiveness of the economy. Even with the CB intervention, Rupee has been highly volatile with annual depreciation in the range of 2% and 15% after 1978 and around 17% this year alone.
* Foreign Reserve
Foreign reserve has been at around 3-5 months of imports of goods whereas imports have been 2-8 times greater the foreign reserve. However, the reserve has been 2-5 times greater than the current account deficit that shows a comfortable level to finance deficits. There is no consistent series of information to assess the reserve adequacy to finance short-term foreign capital liabilities (in addition to current account deficit).
Foreign reserve is maintained through capital inflow, primarily short-term foreign borrowing of the government and the CB, as current account has been mostly a deficit. Since 1950, total BOP during the past 67 years is a surplus around US$ 7 bn through capital inflow which has helped accumulation of a foreign reserve of around US$ US$ 8 bn (with valuation effects) as at end of 2017. New official foreign borrowings are raised to repay such foreign capital as the economy/private sector is unable to generate a BOP surplus.
As both current account and capital flows are highly volatile, foreign reserve also is highly volatile. The major threat to the reserve is the capital outflow/repayment as the reserve is built from such capital. Therefore, the current level and quality of the foreign reserve shows considerable vulnerabilities of the economy. In this background, if the CB agitates not to use the reserve during times of high capital outflows, it calls for the country to default on foreign payments. This is a gross violation of the CB’s public duties.
Policy Framework
In the present globalized world, no economics argues for an economy to develop and live within its domestic resources if its population wishes to live at globally comparable living standards. There is no dispute that many countries and billions of people have come out of the poverty through global value chain that has provided immense opportunities to countries for their development. Further, there is no dispute that Sri Lanka is far behind its peer countries in development through the global value chain.
Therefore, it will be good economic democracy if those who seek public votes to govern the country propose a framework of fiscal, monetary and exchange policies to improve the country’s competitiveness in international business with time-based targets on economic growth, current account, foreign reserve and exchange rate during next 5-10 years. Travels by policymakers around the world to see developed/developing countries and to invite multinational investors will not have done any good. Otherwise, the country’s future generation will not have any hope for living on motherland.
