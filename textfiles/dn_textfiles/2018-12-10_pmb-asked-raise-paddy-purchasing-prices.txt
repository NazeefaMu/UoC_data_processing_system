PMB asked to raise paddy purchasing prices

The Paddy Marketing Board (PMB) was informed to raise prices of paddy that the Board purchases from the farmers and to provide rice to the public at reasonable prices, MP Mahinda Amaraweera said at a recently held meeting in Hambantota.
The MP said the PMB released a consignment of rice to the consumsers for the first time. About 25 years ago, 29 per cent of export revenue of the country earned by sending rice abroad but now it has dropped to 8 per cent.
He said he has taken steps to minimise goods being imported that could be grown in the country to save foreign exchange.
He said benefits will be given to farmers to encourage them in paddy farming.
Now the public sector of the country is nearly free of corruption and frauds and new investments will be channeled into the agriculture sector.
