Two cases against Shashi Weerawansa fixed for further trial

 
Two cases filed against Shashi Weerawansa, the wife of National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader Wimal Weerawansa, over an incident where she had fraudulently obtained two passports, including a diplomatic passport by submitting forged documents to the Immigration and Emigration Department, were yesterday fixed for further trial by the Colombo Chief Magistrate.
The seventh, 16th and 17th witnesses of the case were noticed to appear in Courts on May 25, 30 and 31 by Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara. On a previous occasion, in his evidence, an Assistant Commissioner attached to the Department of Registration of Persons had informed Court that Shashi Weerawansa had applied for a National Identity Card (NIC) in 2010 as a person who applied for the first time. He said the accused had submitted her application for an NIC at the age of 39 as a person who never obtained an NIC.
When the cases came up before Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara, defence counsel appearing on behalf of the accused sought a further date for the trial citing that they are required to peruse a document.
The CID had filed two charge sheets against Shashi Weerawansa that she had fraudulently obtained two passports, including a diplomatic passport by submitting forged documents to the Immigration and Emigration Department.
The witness had earlier informed Chief Magistrate Bandara that an article published on Ravaya newspaper had revealed the accused had possessed two identity cards by two different numbers indicating that she was born in 1967 and 1971.
The case was fixed for further trial on August 29. The witness is to be cross-examined on the next trial date.
On a previous occasion, the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) filed a charge sheet against Shashi Weerawansa under two counts.
Shashi Weerawansa was arrested on February, 2015 over the charge of obtaining diplomatic and general passports illegally.
She had allegedly submitted birth certificate with forged names and dates of birth to obtain the passports. She is out on bail.
Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris, Chief Inspector Jayantha and Police Constable Ganegedara of CID prosecuted. President’s Counsel Anil de Silva with Jayantha Weerasinghe PC appeared for the accused.
