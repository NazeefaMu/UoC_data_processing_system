e-Local Government Network launched

The inauguration ceremony to launch the e-local Government Network initiative was held yesterday (January 29) at the BMICH Lotus Hall with the participation of Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha, and Telecommunications and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando as Chief Guests.
Speaking at the event Minister Faiszer Musthapha stated that this was a step towards eliminating corruption and malpractices within Local Authorities. He mentioned that while ministers exercise their executive authority through the Secretary of the Ministry and while the President exercises his authority through his Secretary, it is finally the Chairman or the Mayor of the Local Government Authority that has to directly carry out this authority and therefore, the Political Authority has to limit itself to Policy decisions. The Minister believes that after the new political authority is elected to office, proper decisions would be taken without giving into bureaucracy.
The Minster commended Harin Fernando and the ICTA for their role in project.
