Farewell to dr. Dharmasena Pathiraja
But the legacy lives on

He has often been dubbed as a ‘rebel with a cause’ and an ‘enfant terrible’ during the height of his career in the 1970s. The pioneer of Sri Lankan cinema’s second revolution film director and screenwriter Dr. Dharmasena Pathiraja, known fondly as ‘Pathi’ among his contemporaries, passed away yesterday while undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Kandy. He was 74 at the time of his demise.
Pathiraja was renowned for the films he made during the 1970s - a particularly chaotic period for social change. He was one of the prominent figures in the arts scene who vied to challenge the existing social order via his medium – cinema.
Starting off his cinematic stint with the 10 minute short film ‘Saturo’ in 1970, Pathiraja carved a niche for himself for making movies which focused on the realistic film realm – the alienation of underclass youth in post colonial political setting. ‘One League Of Sky’ (Ahas Gawwa) followed four years after ‘Sathuro’. The film dealt with the urban lower class and was a typical of most commercial films of that period. It was critically well-received, sweeping the FCJAC Awards by winning the Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor awards. It also clinched the Office Catholique Internationale Du Cinema (Sri Lanka) awards for Best Film and Best Director.
Pathiraja regards his films as social commentaries. They are critical of attitudes wrought by the social and political circumstances of the era. They are also sympathetic to the humanistic dilemmas that beset them. Since he has studied the cinema of radical activists like Jean-Luc Godard, Third Cinema filmmakers like Fernando Solanas and Glauber Rocha, and Asians like Mrinal Sen, Satyajit Ray and Ritwik Ghatak, Pathiraja was able to weave together visual, narrative and ideological motifs in a complex and extraordinary manner. He moved away from bourgeois idealism towards a socially engaged and critically humanist cinema. It is said that this approach influenced the next generation of filmmakers like Prasanna Vithanage and Asoka Handagama who lead the country’s third cinematic revolution.
Pathiraja’s ‘Eya Dan Loku Lamayek’ was Sri Lanka’s entry at the ninth Moscow International Film Festival in 1975. It won a Special Diploma for Female Performance in 1976 and the Special award from the peace council of the USSR to be screened at the 18th Venice Film Festival in Bergamo, Italy.
‘Bambaru Avith’ is widely considered as his masterpiece. It represented Sri Lanka at the 10th Moscow International Film Festival and was screened at the Venice and Los Angeles Film Festivals. It won the Presidential Film Awards and the OCIC Awards for Best Director and Best Film. It was named the fourth best Sri Lankan film of all-time by a special council selected to celebrate 50 years of Sri Lankan cinema in 1997. ‘Ponmani’ (A Tamil film-1977), ‘Paara Dige’ (1980), ‘Soldadu Unnehe’ (1981), ‘Waasuli’, ‘Sira Kandaura’, ‘Shelton Haa Kanthi’’ (Destroyed during ethnic riots in 1983), ‘Swaroopa’, ‘Sakkarang’ and ‘In Search of a Road’ (documentary - 2006) are some of his other cinematic creations. ‘Ella Langa Walawwa’, ‘Maaya Mandira’, ‘Gangulen Egodata’ and ‘Nadunana Putheku’ are some of his renowned teledramas.
An old boy of Dharmaraja College, Kandy, Pathiraja has graduated with an honours degree in Sinhala and Western Classical Culture at Peradeniya University in 1967. Later he completed his PhD in Bengali cinema from Monash University, Australia.
Pathiraja produced around 30 documentaries on professional Umatic and betacam formats for national and international organisations including the United Nations during his time. Some have won both national and international awards.
The 15-minute documentary ‘Punaravarthana’ (Rejuvenation), made for the United Nations Environmental Program won the ‘Bronze’ award at the 15th International Agricultural Film festival, West Berlin, in 1988.
He also directed the stage plays like ‘The Lame and the Blind’ (Kora Saha Andhaya) – the first Sinhala play translated into French and published in ‘L’ Avent Scene’ in 1975, Paris. Chairs (Putu) which won the State Award for Best Translation produced in 1971 State Drama Festival, and ‘Birds’ (Kurullo) are two of his other stage dramas. He has also worked as a lecturer in Drama and Performing Arts for a span.
