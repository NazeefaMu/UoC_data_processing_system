Leonardo DiCaprio pledges $20m to tackle climate change

 
Leonardo DiCaprio has announced his foundation will give out $20m (£15m) to tackle the effects of climate change.
The huge sum will be spread between more than 100 organisations supporting wildlife protection, marine conservation and climate change programmes.
It will be the largest amount ever donated by the Oscar-winner's foundation, which has given out around £60m since its was set up in 1998.
"We are proud to support the work of over 100 organisations at home and abroad," DiCaprio said in a statement before attending a climate change conference at Yale University.
"These grantees are active on the ground, protecting our oceans, forests and endangered species for future generations - and tackling the urgent, existential challenges of climate change."
The grants cover six areas: climate change, wildlife and landscape conservation, marine life and ocean conservation, innovative solutions, indigenous rights and the California climate change program.
"Our challenge is to find new ways to power our lives, employ millions of people and turn every individual into an advocate for clean air and drinkable water," DiCaprio said.
"We must demand that politicians accept climate science and make bold commitments before it is too late."
The areas targeted by the grants include Somalia, Kenya, the Amazon and the United States.
Last year, the actor met with Donald Trump to discuss climate change and how green jobs could boost the US economy.
After the meeting, the actor gave the then President-elect a copy of his documentary Before The Flood, which Trump promised to watch.
