Sri Lankans with forged visas jailed for 8 months

Three Sri Lankan men were convicted and sentenced last Friday to eight months’ jail for possessing forged Malaysian visas in their passports, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) in Malaysia said.
They were arrested by ICA officers on June 27 after anomalies were detected in their visas during checks at Woodlands Checkpoint, The Straits Times reported.
Nalliah Selvamany Rohan, 26, Kanthanadan Jasitharan, 23, and Roopan Diasrepinsan, 20, were looking for employment outside of Sri Lanka.
The first two approached an agent in Sri Lanka, Rajanikanth, to make arrangements for a trip to Malaysia for Rs. 305,000 each. The third approached another agent to make the same trip for Rs. 500,000.
Rohan and Jasitharan arrived in Singapore on June 18, and the forged Malaysian visas were attached to their passports. Roopan arrived on June 26 and had the same done.
On June 27, Rajanikanth arranged for a Malaysian taxi to take the three men to Malaysia at about 8pm.
ICA officers nabbed the trio at about 9.20pm. Rajanikanth had left Singapore before investigations started, and the Malaysian taxi driver was found to be uninvolved in the scam. Under the Passports Act, Section 47(6), a person convicted of knowingly possessing false foreign travel documents may be fined up to $10,000 or imprisoned for a term not exceeding 10 years, or both.
