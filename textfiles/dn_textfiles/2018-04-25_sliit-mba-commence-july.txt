SLIIT  MBA to commence from July

SLIIT, a world-class institute with UGC approved degrees in Business, Computing, Engineering, Architecture and Quantity Surveying is launching its Master of Business Administration (MBA) Program on May 10. This SLIIT - MBA Program conducted by SLIIT Business School will commence in July 2018.
The course content of the SLIIT MBA program has been carefully designed to meet current industry needs in consultation with industry experts and academia from locally and globally renowned personalities and approved by the Ministry of Higher Education.
The SLIIT – MBA would stand out as a unique program among MBAs offered in Sri Lanka due to its’ novel attributes. A special feature of the program includes a workshop conducted by the Business School of Carlton University in Canada on the latest trends in business management and technology. This one-week workshop in Canada is mandatory for all participants and is scheduled during the first term of the second year. As the SLIIT business School meets half the cost of the workshop including airfare and accommodation, the participants only have to pay 50% of the expenditure of the overseas workshop.
Another unique feature is the availability of renowned professors from high ranking overseas and Sri Lankan universities and professional organizations, who will deliver regular and guest lecturers. Prof. Lalith Gamage, CEO and Vice Chancellor SLIIT commented: “The quality of teaching and learning that participants of our MBA program experience offer them exceptional, the lifelong value that goes far beyond the qualification itself. Our institute has earned a fine reputation as an exceptional business school that is yet unmatched in the private sector and this brings us great pride and spurs us to achieve higher goals, year after year.”
The applicants with a Bachelor’s Degree in Business Administration or related area from a recognized university are eligible to apply for the course. Those with a Bachelor’s Degree in other subject areas need to have one year’s post qualifying experience. Applicants with professional qualifications and two year’s post-qualifying experience approved by SLIIT are also eligible to apply.
