Shaun Marsh, Smith warm up for Tests with centuries

At an informal all-Australian practice two-day match at P Sara Stadium yesterday Shaun Marsh and captain Steve Smith scored centuries before retiring.
Opening the batting in the absence of David Warner (who remains affected by the fractured left index finger he sustained during the recent ODI tri-series in the West Indies), Marsh completed a solid, patient century in taxing humidity.
Against an opposing attack that featured the not-always-friendly firepower of Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, Nathan Lyon and Moises Henriques as well as a handful of eager young bucks.
On a pitch that sported a tinge of green that – offered more encouragement to the quicks than the standard subcontinent deck.
Joe Burns might have been the only specialist Test batsman to lose his wicket across 90 overs yesterday – caught behind for nine when trying to squeeze a wide, yorker-length delivery from Starc through point – but his place in the starting XI for the first Test starting at Kandy on July 26 is not in doubt.
Marsh can make an even stronger case for a Test recall in next week’s marginally more formal three-day tour match against an as-yet-unnamed Sri Lanka Cricket Board XI at the same venue in Colombo’s inner-east.
Where Warner will once again be sidelined having only returned to ‘shadow’ batting in the nets yesterday and filling various roles as 12th man, umpire and beyond-the-rope outfielder during the 89 overs in which Smith’s XI posted 4/389 against the side captain by Adam Voges.
The vice-captain’s absence is likely to be the only anomaly between the team that takes to the lush P Sara field for that game and the XI for the first of the three Tests against a largely unheralded and equally under-rated Sri Lanka.
Australia’s most potent paceman Mitchell Starc, impressed in his first competitive red-ball hit-out since major ankle surgery last November.
After dismissing Burns, he welcomed his Test captain Steve Smith to the crease with a steepling bounced followed by an even more menacing short ball into the captain’s ribs.
Starc finished with three of the four wickets to fall to bowlers – Shaun Marsh and Smith both retired from the middle upon reaching their respective centuries – and rattled the stumps of National Performance Squad member Hilton Cartwright and fellow fast bowling cartel member Nathan Coulter-Nile.
He showed his stamina won’t be an issue in the enervating post-monsoonal heat despite his extended lay-off, sending a bouncer sailing over ‘keeper Peter Nevill’s head for four byes with the second new ball late in the day.
But even though the pitch offered good carry when the ball was hard and shiny and a few jumped off a length, it often yielded more ‘tennis ball’ bounce that meant those batsmen who got going – Smith, Marsh and his younger brother Mitchell (77 no) – were able to cash in.
Certainly there was slow turn but little else on offer for the spinners, with Lyon, highly-rated young wrist spinner Mitchell Swepson and his fellow leggie Arjun Nair all copping punishment when they dropped short and the ball sat up, asking to be hit.
It’s unlikely that will change drastically tomorrow when Steve O’Keefe will have the chance to push his claims for the role of second spinner in the upcoming Test series, bowling to the likes of Voges, Khawaja and Nevill in this faux fixture.
