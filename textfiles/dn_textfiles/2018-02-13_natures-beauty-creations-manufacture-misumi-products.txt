Natures Beauty Creations to manufacture MISUMI products

The MISUMI brand embodies the goodness and scientifically proven efficacy of Japan’s natural ingredients for a beautiful, clear complexion. MISUMI is manufactured by Nature’s Beauty Creations, one of Sri Lanka’s most awarded and certified cosmetics company, in partnership with Japan’s renowned Ichimaru Pharcos.
The brand recently launched two new beauty products to its growing portfolio, MISUMI radiant white skin brightening gel and MISUMI perfect radiance whitening facial cleanser.
Nature’s Beauty Creations CEO, Samira Fonseka stated, “We are proud to be a company that is renowned and respected, in both Sri Lanka and overseas, for our outstanding research, product excellence and use of natural ingredients across all our beauty brands. We are delighted to be in partnership with Japan’s Ichimaru Pharcos, in creating the MISUMI beauty products to the highest quality standards.”
The MISUMI radiant white skin brightening gel is formulated with the power of eight natural ingredients and the MISUMI perfect radiance whitening facial cleanser is infused with four skin brightening natural extracts.
“When we launched our MISUMI whitening beauty soap with Japanese Sakura, customers were captivated by its uniqueness and high quality TFM of 78%, which made the quality of our soap far superior to the bathing bars in the market which had a far lower TFM. We are confident that our customers will embrace our two new MISUMI products with similar enthusiasm for their superior quality and effectiveness. With MISUMI, we provide safe beauty you can trust,” Samira further said.
