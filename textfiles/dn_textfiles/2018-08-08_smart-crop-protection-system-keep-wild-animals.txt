Smart Crop Protection System to keep off wild animals

A new invention called the Smart Crop Protection System (SCPS) has been introduced to protect cultivations from wild animals.
The invention, introduced by Dr. Sarath Wimalasooriya and electronic engineer Achala Uthsuka, is an electric fencing system.
The Agriculture Ministry has distributed 25 SCPSs to farmers in the first model agricultural village in Haputale, Kahattewela.
Farmers in Kahattewela had appreciated the attempt and according to them, the system was highly successful. The country loses around 30 - 40 percent of the agricultural harvest annually due to wild animals, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
“The Agriculture Ministry had received several requests from farmers to find a solution to the issue of crops being destroyed by wild animals such as elephants, monkeys, wild boar, porcupines and peacocks,” said the minister.
“However, the government cannot kill any animal but alternative solutions are needed to address this problem,” he said.
