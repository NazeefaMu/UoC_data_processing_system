IVF treatment to be made free

Arrangements will be made to offer In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) treatment free from the state sector, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Minister Senaratne said at present, IVF and other modern medical treatment is available only in the private sector and they are expensive. Only a small percentage of people have access to them, he said. He expressed these views during a ceremony at the BMICH yesterday to mark the Family Planning Day.
Minister Senaratne said the government expects to provide medical treatment for sub-fertility free and now plans are being formulated to achieve this target. It is expected to provide these services in all districts. Some interpret family planning as restricting the growth of the population which is completely wrong and misinterpreted, he added.
