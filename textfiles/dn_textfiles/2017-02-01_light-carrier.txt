Light carrier

The title of the book by young Piyadeep Kaur, a Punjabi Speaking Sikh near adolescent, has many meanings I guess.
She sees Millions of Faces in a Face. Does it mean attributes of several deities in only ONE God in the Hindu Pantheon? The reason for this assumption is she shows a bias for spirituality, though it is not obvious. Or, she sees millions of faces in her home city Banaras that all belong to one humankind. Or, it maybe she sees the faces of her two male friends as belonging to one species.
In her acknowledgements, Priyadeep Kaur concludes with this line: Lastly, the light inside all of us, Shiva. Om ShanthiHer book is immensely popular with her readers, particularly the younger generation, judging by the fact that last year it has two imprints. The 256 page book is published by Mahaveer Publishers, 4675A-21, Second Floor, Ansari Road, Daryaganj, New Delhi-11002 and priced at 175 Indian Rupees. This is her maiden book. Recently she had presented her book to the Indian Prime Minister Modi and received his blessings too.
I met this young personality in Udaipur in Rajasthan at a Literary Festival, where she gave this book to me. She is a Commerce graduate, a musician on stage, and a teacher to kids in villages. As the blurb says, “Apart from creativity, spirituality, meditation, love, and virtues are what she dies for.”
This novel is both erratic and erotic in some places. It is erratic because the structure of the novel is done in a haphazard manner that a conventional reader might get confused. Although the main female character, Dimple Ahluwalia, remains chaste and shocked in seeing Mangesh, a Marathi speaking lover half-naked, she and he engage in frank and erotic dialogues. The novel is dramatic and in most places the story is narrated in the form of dialogue.The novel begins with her 5th standard class mate, Sumit Sharma and Dimple admits she had a crush on him. Later she encounters her undeclared love affair with Mangesh. While the latter lets her down, Sumit appeases her. The end is inconclusive to my mind.Speaking of the languages used, one reads little passages in Hindi, Marathi, and other languages. But the novel is in English.The writer’s use of English brings to the realization of the fact that there is a variety of Englishs we know. This novel is a good example for academics to dissect the regional accents and nuances found in contemporary usage of English in India. The characters in the novel are all affluent people behaving like any other young people in the world.To me it is a fascinating short novel to understand the mindset of young people. Irrespective of the grammatical errors and the employment of slangs, the novel is a study case for psychiatrists.
I congratulate Praiyadeep Kaur for her imaginative novel that underscores the idea of love.
