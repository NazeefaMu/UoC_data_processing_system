Chris Gayle gifts his bat to 'legend' Amitabh Bachchan

 
Megastar Amitabh Bachchan was stumped when he was presented an autographed bat by cricketer Chris Gayle. He says he is in awe of the reach of Indian cinema and that finding a fan in the West Indian cricket star came as a "revelation" to him.
The 73-year-old took to various social media platforms to express his happiness over getting the token of love from the international batting sensation.
He tweeted, "Mr. Chris Gayle... What an honour... I never knew you would know me... So humbled. We are all great fans of yours! I mean Chris Gayle, a fan of Hindi movies and presents me a golden bat autographed? I mean this is revelation".
Gayle, who plays in the Indian Premier League as well, proclaimed himself to be a big fan of the Bollywood 'Shahenshah', who has regaled film buffs for over four decades. "Proud to gift my Spartan bat to a legend @srbachchan, love his movies and his style, legend. Thanks @spartancricket," Gayle tweeted.
After Big B thanked him, Gayle posted: "See you soon in India." The 'Paa' star also used Facebook to express his happiness. He posted: "Chris Gayle! The phenomenal cricketer from WI sent me a bat autographed... Amazing... I never knew he was such a fan of our films... humbled and so overwhelmed."
Meanwhile, Amitabh is recovering from a mild ailment which laid him low. - IANS
