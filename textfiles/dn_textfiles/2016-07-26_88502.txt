I’m pregnant, not a corpse Kareena

Soon after her actor-husband Saif Ali Khan confirmed Kareena Kapoor Khan’s pregnancy on July 2, reports about her maternity break and speculation about her upcoming projects started doing the rounds. It was also reported that the Bollywood actor, who is due in December, will complete the shoot of her next with Sonam Kapoor and also the shoots for some magazine covers by October before she goes on maternity leave. But Kareena is disappointed with these reports.
“I’m pregnant, not a corpse. And what maternity break? It’s the most normal thing on earth to produce a child. It is high time the media back off, and stop treating me any different than I ever was. Anybody who is bothered shouldn’t work with me... but my work goes on as is, like always. Stop making it a national casualty. We are in 2016, not in the 1800s.
Probably, even at that time, people were way more civilised and normal than the way the media is behaving and speculating now,” says Kareena, adding, “I’m just fed-up of people making it (her pregnancy) to be a death of some sort. In fact, it should be a message to a lot of people that marriage or having a family has absolutely nothing to do with my career.”
Apparently, Kareena currently has over 18 brand endorsement deals, and she plans to shoot for the campaigns in the upcoming months. Ask her about her association with her brands, and she says, “It is great… they will love me for what I stand for, what I represent, and my talent.
