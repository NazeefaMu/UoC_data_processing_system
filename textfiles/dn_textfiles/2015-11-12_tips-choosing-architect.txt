Tips for choosing an architect

* Check with local builders and trades people if they know a good architect they have worked with before.
* Source two to three architects to contact, they should visit you initially for free to discuss the project.
* Make sure they have created designs for extensions and conversions in the area of your local authority, ask what their approval rate is for submissions and speak to local building control surveyors.
* Secure in writing that they have full knowledge of planning permission and building regulations (or standards) in your local authority.
* Let the architect know what your budget is, minimum and maximum for the build, explain whether this includes decoration or additional features such as a bathroom suite or kitchen.
* Check what services the architect will supply. Will they secure planning and building regulation approval? If changes to design are required to secure approval, will you have to pay extra? Make sure they have professional indemnity insurance.
* Find out how many visits to your property are required to finalise the design and/or project manage the build.
* Some architects are great at design but don’t have the experience of managing tradespeople, check previous projects and secure references and feedback from clients and trade.
* Agree a budget, ideally fixed, for designing the additional space.
* Always meet with the architect at your property to ensure they understand the details of your build.
* Ensure you sign a contract with the architect, agreeing payment terms in return for the services they offer.
* Explain to the architect whether you want the extra space to be in keeping with your current style, more modern or traditional.
