GMOA to launch Anti-SAITM strike tomorrow

 
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) will launch a strike tomorrow until September 15 in protest of government’s failure to solve the SAITM issue.
GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said on September 7 that the GMOA along with the Anti-SAITM People's Barricade will launch a strike if the government fails to offer a real solution to the SAITM issue.
He said, ‘an Anti-SAITM vehicle parade will commence on September 12 and will tour around the country on the 12, 13 and 14. It will reach Colombo on September 15 and the entire Colombo city will be blocked and disrupted of all activities’.
