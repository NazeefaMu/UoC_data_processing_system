Alleged missing pages of Bond Commission report
Party Leaders want Speaker to inquire  from Secretary to the President

Party Leaders yesterday requested Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to inquire from the Secretary to the President regarding the complaint about the alleged missing pages in the recently released Presidential Commission of Inquiry report on the Bond issue.
A special Party Leaders’ Meeting was chaired by the Speaker yesterday morning to discuss on a Parliamentary debate on the Bond report and the PRECIFAC report.
Parliamentary sources said MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena complained that several annexures of the report were missing, and the Speaker at the meeting agreed to communicate it to the Secretary to the President.
However, sources said a date on a Parliamentary debate on the reports was not agreed upon during the meeting.
The JVP and the Joint Opposition have requested a date for the debate.
It has been decided to hold another Party Leaders’ Meeting today (23) following the tabling of Bond report and PRECIFAC report to determine when the debate will be held.
