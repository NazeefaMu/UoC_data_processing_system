16th Gajaba Supercross brings Saliyapura track alive on August 27

The 16th edition of the Gajaba Supercross organized by the SL Army's Gajaba Regiment in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Autosports Drivers Association (SLADA) and with the main sponsorship by CEAT will be held at the Anuradhapura, Saliyapura Gajaba racing track on August 27. This was revealed to the media during a press briefing at the Sri Lanka Electrical and Mechanical Engineers Regiment headquarters in Colombo recently.
Over 200 contestants will compete in 25 events including 12 motor car and 13 motorbike events in this year's Gajaba Supercross. This event is the fourth and final annual CEAT - SLADA Championship event of 2017 and a great enthusiasm has been shown among the contestants to earn more points before the year end. The six-event CEAT - SLADA Championship will not be able to complete its remaining two events before this December. Inaugurated in 1999, Gajaba Supercross is considered second only to Foxhill Supercross and did not conducted in 2000, 2008 and 2009 due to the regiment's strong commitment to appease the terrorist war in the country.
Adjutant General of SL Army, Colonel of the Gajaba Regiment and Gajaba Supercross Steering Committee head Maj. Gen. Shavendra Silva reminded the great service rendered to the motherland by the Gajaba Regiment being a major infantry force in the war front. As a result, Gajaba Regiment became the highest casualty regiment due to war with 171 officers and 4090 other ranker deaths, 125 officers and 3637 soldiers partially or fully disabled.
According to Maj. Gen. Shavendra Silva, Two main reasons led to the inception of Gajaba Supercross. The main reason was to raise funds to look after Regiment's war heroes and their families and secondly to cater motor sport fans of distant parts of the country like, Anuradhapura, Vavunia and Jaffna. He also revealed in this year alone seven houses are under construction for war hero families.
The 2km gravel track is considered to be the country's fastest track, with larger spectator areas where onlookers are offered a larger scope to view the full track from a one place.
The famous Foxhill track' s architect Hans Ralf and Maj Gen Gamini Gunasekera pioneered the construction of Gajaba track and the funds created by the Gajaba Supercross over the years were also directed to develop infrastructure and training facilities of the regimental training institute.
Organizers have arranged a special spectator stand in memory of late riding maestro Anada Wedisinghe at the Gajaba track and the Anada Wedisinghe Trophy will be awarded to the champion of the Super Motard bike event.
The Best Driver will take home the W.D.G.A Gunasekara Rolling Trophy while the Best Rider will be awarded the Hans Ralf Rolling Trophy. The tickets will be available only at the race venue entrance and priced at Rs. 500 (Grand Stand) and Rs. 100 (normal).
The SLADA president Mahesh Gammanpila explaining the race proceedings said; There will be a great contest at this year's Gajaba Suprecross as record number of 104 car and 134 motorbike entries have been received.
