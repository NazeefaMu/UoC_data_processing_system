Matara people to receive major  water projects, sanitisation facilities

New projects will be initiated in the Matara district to provide drinking water and sanitation facilities for the residents.
The Divisional Secretariat Divisions of Dickwelle, Devinuwara, Matara, Weligama, Mulatiyana, Pasgoda, and Pitabeddara will be provided drinking water under the new projects shortly. Over 30 low income families were provided with fabricated water tanks and 20 families were granted financial aids to construct water sealed lavatories under the projects.
The Project Director and Director of the Institute for Developments of Community Strengths is to provide 130 needy families with fabricated water tanks and financial aids for them to put up water sealed latrines this month.
The German Association for International Development funds the projects, Programme Director C. Ranawaka said.
