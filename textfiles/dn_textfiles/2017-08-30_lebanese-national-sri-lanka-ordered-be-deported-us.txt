Lebanese national in Sri Lanka ordered to be deported to US

 
The Colombo High Court ordered to deport a Lebanese national wanted in United States for allegations surrounding the involvement of several financial frauds in US.
Colombo High Court Judge Vikum Kaluarachchi made this order pursuant to an application made by Attorney General that the Lebanese national be deported to US in accordance with the Extradition Law. 
The US State Department requested Sri Lankan authorities for the extradition of Lebanese national Ahmed Fakhri. 
The High Court Judge observed that the respondent Lebanese national is alleged to have committed extraditable offence and thereby he should be taken into custody in terms of Extradition Law. It was reported that the Lebanese National had obstructed photo journalist Prasanna Mendis from carrying out his duties at the High Court premises when he was being taken into prison custody.
