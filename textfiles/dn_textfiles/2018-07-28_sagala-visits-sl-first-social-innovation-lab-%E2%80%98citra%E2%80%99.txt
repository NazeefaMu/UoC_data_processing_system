Sagala visits SL first  social innovation lab ‘Citra’

Youth Affairs, Project Management and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka last week visited Citra - Sri Lanka’s first Social Innovation Lab - to discuss the collaborative initiatives between the Ministry and the Innovation Lab.
Citra is a joint initiative between the Science, Technology, Research, Skills Development and Vocational Training and Kandyan Heritage Ministry, and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Sri Lanka.
The lab uses foresight and innovation tools to prototype and test development solutions to ensure they are agile and holistic.
Its wo41rk is aligned to the national development priorities of the country and it works towards bringing in greater citizen engagement to formulate development solutions.
