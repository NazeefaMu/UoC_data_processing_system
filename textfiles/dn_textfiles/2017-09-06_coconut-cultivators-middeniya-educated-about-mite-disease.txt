Coconut cultivators in Middeniya educated about mite disease

Coconut cultivators at Julampitiya in Middeniya were educated recently about the mite disease that heavily damages the cultivation. The programme was organised by the Walasmulla Coconut Cultivation Development Office Project Director.
Coconut Cultivation Development Officer A.P.A. Gunawardena said many cultivators were not aware of the disease.
The mite disease was first identified in 1997 at Kalpitiya in the Puttalam District. It was first reported from Mexico in 1960. He said the disease spreads mostly in dry zone areas. It could be controlled in two ways; with chemicals and bio-diversity scientific system, he said.
