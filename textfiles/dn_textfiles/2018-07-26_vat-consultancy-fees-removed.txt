VAT on consultancy fees removed

The Cabinet approved the removal of Value Added Tax (VAT) for expenditures in health services to reduce the healthcare cost of the people.
The VAT imposed on consultancy fees and other fees that affects patients will be removed.
Public seeking services from private hospitals had constantly complained to the Health Ministry of high costs for their services due to the VAT. The Ministry also pointed out that the 15 percent VAT imposed on the local medical fees was putting undue pressure on the public.
