Linea Aqua Hanwella obtains world  first with WaterNeutral Certification

Linea Aqua announced its latest landmark accomplishment in environmental sustainability obtaining the WaterNeutral Certification for its Hanwella factory, making it the first apparel manufacturing facility in the world to have achieved this status.
Water Neutrality is a novel concept first coined by the Water Footprint Network of the Netherlands - a non-profit, multi-stakeholder, global organisation, in collaboration with the University of Twente, which was further customised by The Sustainable Future Group (SFG) taking into account other published global concepts in developing its WaterNeutral certification.
The theory behind it is based on achieving the maximum, reasonably possible reduction of a business entity's fresh water consumption by means of reusing and recycling water.
Another important requirement of this certification is the reasonable, responsible and effective investment(s) into projects aimed toward improving sustainable and equitable use of water. Commenting on the historic occasion at the handover ceremony, Linea Aqua outgoing CEO and Managing Director Sarinda Unamboowe who initiated the project said Linea Aqua has always placed sustainability at the forefront of its business operations and this latest initiative is no different. "We pledge to become the first-ever WaterNeutral apparel manufacturer in the world, and we hope that our efforts towards reducing our operational Water Footprint would set a precedent within the industry.”
CCC CEO Sanith De S Wijeyeratne said, “Water is a precious natural resource that is in abundance in Sri Lanka, but we don't give much thought about its conservation. It is heartening to see companies like Linea Aqua take the initiative towards measuring and minimising the impact of their operations on our water table. I hope that other companies will follow suit and help us safeguard one of the most vital resources we have been blessed with.”
This significant achievement of Linea Aqua further showcases the company's commitment towards becoming a more sustainable business entity in Sri Lanka.
