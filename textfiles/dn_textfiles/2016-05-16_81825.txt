MR putting up an act for political expediency: Mangala

Responding to several recent statements made by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera says that they again prove that the Rajapaksa’s efforts to portray him as a human rights defender and upholder of democracy while in the opposition, is merely an act done for the sake of political expediency.
In an open letter to the former President, Foreign Minister Samaraweera said: “The many statements you have been making lately, especially the recent statement made by you opposing the Human Rights Council resolution, brings me genuine sorrow because it reminds once again that your role as a great human rights defender and upholder of democracy was merely an act done for the sake of political expediency while you were in the Opposition.”
While identifying the UN resolution as a victory for Sri Lankan’s and the country’s foreign policy Samaraweera added: “Your statement opposing the UN Human Rights Council Resolution exemplifies just how self-serving, unpatriotic and opportunistic politician you have become”.
The minister added: “When you were in the opposition, human rights, Geneva and the international community were your friends. But when power intoxicated you, they were forgotten and anyone who dared to talk of such universal values such as democracy, human rights and the rule of law were labeled as LTTE sympathisers and traitors. Now that you are out of power, looking at your coconut-breaker cronies’ business class travel to Geneva, it appears you have remembered them again”.
