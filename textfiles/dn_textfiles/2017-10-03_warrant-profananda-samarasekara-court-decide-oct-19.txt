Warrant on Prof.Ananda Samarasekara: Court to decide on Oct. 19

 
The Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court today fixed for October 19 to decide whether or not to issue a warrant for the arrest of former Colombo Chief Medical Officer Prof.Ananda Samarasekara over the alleged role in the cover up of evidence when conducting the first post mortem on Thajudeen’s body.
Filing a motion before Colombo Additional Magistrate Jayram Trotsky, the CID yesterday sought a warrant for the arrest of former Colombo Chief Medical Officer Prof.Ananda Samarasekara and to name former JMO Ananda Samarasekara as the third suspect in the Thajudeen murder case.
The Additional Magistrate observed that he would make a suitable order regarding these requests after inspecting the facts pertaining to a Fundamental Rights petition filed by Ananda Samarasekara and his anticipatory bail application.
Meanwhile, the CID today tendered in Court information pertaining to the FR petition and anticipatory bail application filed by Prof. Ananda Samarasekara.
Prof. Samarasekara had filed a Fundamental Rights petition in the Supreme Court seeking an interim order preventing CID from arresting him in connection with the alleged loss of body parts of late Wasim Thajudeen.
Filing a further report in court, ASP Wickremasekara of CID Homicide Investigations Unit said that Ananda Samarasekara can be charged for concealing evidence under section 198 of the Penal Code.
'The investigations conducted so far have revealed that Prof. Samarasekara had also threatened his junior staffs when preparing the post mortem report. Investigations have also revealed former Colombo Chief JMO had acted in an irresponsible manner when he was conducting the first post mortem on Thajudeen’s body,' ASP Wickremasekara said.
At a previous occasion, the Attorney General had informed Court there is a possibility of arresting former Colombo Chief Medical Officer Prof.Ananda Samarasekara over the alleged loss of body parts of rugby player Wasim Thajudeen.
Former Western Province Senior DIG Anura Senanayake and former Narahenpita Crimes OIC Sumith Champika Perera had been named as first and second suspects of this case. They were arrested over their alleged role in the cover up of evidence in the former rugby player Wasim Thajudeen murder and conspiring to commit the murder.
They are currently out on bail.
