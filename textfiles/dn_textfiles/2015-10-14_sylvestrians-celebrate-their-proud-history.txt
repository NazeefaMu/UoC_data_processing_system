Sylvestrians celebrate their proud history

St. Sylvester's College Kandy are celebrating their 75th year with a series of sports activates to mark the occasion. According to information cricket, football, hockey, rugger, athletics, and boxing tournaments will be organized.
In the field of sports the most outstanding of all was Malcolm Bulmer, who was a unique boxer that the country has produced. His record is unmatched. From the time he got into the ring he gave of his best under the guidance of the famous coach Derrick Raymond. Malcolm as a schoolboy achieved many a milestone. By the time he left school at the age of 20 he had already represented (Ceylon) Sri Lanka, at the Commonwealth Games in Perth in 1962, Olympics in Tokyo 1964 and also had beaten all the champions in his weight class in Sri Lanka and won many best boxer trophies.
In 1966 Malcolm migrated to Australia and continued his boxing and won the Australian National Championship. He was selected to represent Australia in 1968 Mexican Olympics but very unfortunate lost that opportunity. There was a rule in Australia that since he had represented another country he has to be a resident of Australia for three years to qualify.
He was short by four months. But Australian government was prepared to bear all his expenses to the Olympics and they were prepared to permit him to represent Sri Lanka because Australians thought that he was a potential gold medalist. But it was so sad as Sri Lankan authorities refused permission. What an unfortunate end to a brilliant amateur boxing career. Malcolm, a South Paw, was the best boxer produced by Derrick Raymond. Some of the other boxers Raymond produced are famous all-round sportsman Nimal Lewke now a retired DIG, who too was a stylish boxer and brought honor to the country at several meets locally and internationally and was adjudged the best boxer at national meets. The others who come to mind are: A.C.R. Herathge, M. Reyal, S.A. Azwer, H. Gunasinghe, J. Peterson N. Thirukumar.
But the first Sylvestrian to win a national boxing title was Donald G. Labrooy who won the Bantam Weight title in early 1950s. He was followed by Malcolm Marshall, Milroy de Soysa, Annabel de Soysa, M.E. Marikar John Gye. Boxing was synonymous with St. Sylvester's which was in the forefront of schools boxing, winning the coveted Stubbs Shield several times (within fourteen years they won on 12 occasions.)
In Cricket it was in 1955 that St. Sylvester's College made a modest beginning by playing a few inter school matches. Their first inter school match was against Vidyartha College, which is today their big match. The first team was coached by J. Denlow and Ronnie Stephen. The side was led by Tony Dirickze and the team was made up of Nihal Pelpola, T. Sathyamurthi, H. Dias, T.G.M. Peries, N. Ratnayake, Vernon Nanayakkara, V. Croos, U. Ariya Chandra, I. Heppenstol, M. Direckze, V.W. Wanigasekara, R.Tilly, and U de Silva. Then it was M.E. Marikar who became the first Sylvesterian to play representative cricket, at a time when St. Sylvester's College had not taken to cricket in a big way. He played for Moors SC, Sinha Regiment, Kandy Sports Club, and Central Province and later for Kandy Lake Club. Nihal Samarasekara became the first to play for the country - before we got test status. Ishak Sahabdeen was the first test player.
The other cricketers who did well for the school and clubs are Nimal Lewke. A fine spinner, in 1967, he was placed second in the Schools' Best Bowling list. He later played for the Police and Government Services. Malcolm Perera became the Sri Lanka Cricket Coaching Manager. Some of others who come to my mind are Roland Perera the present coach, David brothers - Gerard, Kingsley, Sydney and Rodney, N. Herathge, Jayatilake brothers - Rangith and Bandu, Gerry Alexander Hidelarachchi, Mervyn Rodrigo the first Silvestrian to win the 'best outstation school boy' award. T.

Undoubtedly 1994 was the greatest year for St. Sylvester's cricket. Under the present coach Roland Perera's and late Bertie Nilagoda's stewardship as principal. The school won the all Island League Championship but they were deprived of the 'double,' when they got knocked out in the semi final by Ananda College.
Football was another popular sport. From the beginning of the school, many played for the country and it was Mahinda Aluwihare who became the first Sylvestrian to lead the country In eight international games. Then there was M.P. Shabdeeen, W.M. Jawffer, R.P. Wijasiri, M.E. Marikar the first to lead the Ceylon Government services XI and he together with Leslie Weerakody played for the Combined Schools, , Newton .E.A.Perera, I.M. Saheed, Leslley Marshal, Abdul Razak, Edmun Samaraweera, Gerad David, A.H.M. jabar, Jaya Aluwihare, Tony Direckez, Percy Samaraweera, Silva brothers, Rukman,. Rajendra, Rangith and Lakshman, Lesley and Malcom Marshal, Cyril Aluwihare, Abdul Razak, Hasan Peer, Shanthi Mendis, Hector Galuge, M. Ayub, I.M. Anwer, Meera Sibo, Dean Zouril.
Then in hockey this school earned a name thanks to Coach P. Thangaveluin. In the field of hockey there are many who have made the school and the country proud. Now Rugby is one of the most popular sports. They first played rugby in 1954 and 1955, and they gave it up due to lack ground facilities and the game was reintroduced in 1982. It was Malcolm Marshal who led the side first in 1954. Then in Athletics they have produced several top sprinters who have done well in public school games and national events, and at present Darshana Rajapaksha is doing well for the school, Kandy and the country. Then also in sports like Basketball, table Tennis, Chess and Gymnastic they are doing well. The old boys give a big hand for all sports.
