This is currently the Group’s most capital-intensive sector which is redefining the country’s retail landscape with several new projects in the pipeline.
A 100% cash margin was imposed on refrigerators, TVs, air-conditioners and phones seriously impacting cash flows due to the recent policy of removing bank accommodation for import bill refinancing requiring cash upfront for establishing import LCs. The imposition of applicable restrictions on selected import items, especially, in the electronics and footwear sector defeats the long-term vision of establishing Sri Lanka as a shopping destination to compete with other regional tourist destinations. Short sightedness of policy makers could result in several adverse side effects reverberating in the retail sector which is inextricably intertwined with the tourist industry as a whole.
ODEL Group and Softlogic Retail continued to be dominant contributors to the sector performance.
