Wretched Arsenal hit new low as Palace run riot

London:Arsene Wenger’s wretched season hit a new low as Arsenal crashed to a humiliating 3-0 defeat at lowly Crystal Palace that leaves their top four bid in tatters.
Wenger has been under siege in recent weeks as angry Arsenal fans demanded his resignation and the calls for the Gunners boss to quit will grow even louder after one of the most chastening defeats of his 21-year reign.
Needing a victory to keep pace with their rivals in the race for Champions League qualification, spineless Arsenal showed none of the required poise and passion as they crumbled on a woebegone Monday night in south London.
Andros Townsend put Palace ahead in the first half and Yohan Cabaye doubled the hosts’ lead after the break.
Luka Milivojevic’s penalty rubbed salt into Wenger’s wounds as he digested Arsenal’s fifth defeat in their last eight league games.
Arsenal, beaten at Palace for the first time since 1979, were shambolic and their underachieving stars were barracked with chants of “you’re not fit to wear the shirt” in the closing stages of their heaviest league defeat this season.
Wenger’s retort to critics who claim he’s past his best is to point at his record of leading Arsenal into the Champions League for the last 19 seasons. AFP
