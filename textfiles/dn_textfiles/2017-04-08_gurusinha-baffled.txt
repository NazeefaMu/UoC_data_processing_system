Gurusinha baffled

Sri Lanka team’s cricket manager Asanka Gurusinha admitted that he was at a loss for words to describe Sri Lanka’s vacillating performances against Bangladesh in all three formats of the game that saw the Test, ODI and T20I series all being shared one-all instead of the home team ending up winners.
“It comes down to how we play. For me the disappointment was very disappointing nothing to do with the wicket but something wrong somewhere. Very difficult to give answers,” said Gurusinha after Sri Lanka had lost the second T20I to Bangladesh at the R Premadasa Stadium on Thursday and thereby drawn the two-match series 1-all.
“We should have won all three series. Not good to say that we have drawn all three series as we were playing at home. We were expected to win the series,” said Gurusinha.
“I guess Bangladesh came here thinking that they can win here. They are a strong side. They have played very good cricket. So have we but in patches. It’s disappointing to sit here and concede that we haven’t done well. End of the day the way they bounced back after the first game. They did well in all three departments of the game,” he said.
“We played the second and third ODIs well. We played the first T-20 as well but not this one. We need our first six batsmen to fire the top five actually. If we don’t get runs there, it’s going to be a problem. The games we score runs, the top five guys go onto get big scores. We need to bat out 50 overs. If we are to do well in the Champions Trophy, we need to sort out that.”
How much did Sri Lanka miss the all-round contribution of injured captain Angelo Mathews on the tour?
“Angelo is a huge strength for us. But we need to find a way to play without him. He is fit and if we really wanted we could have played him as a batter. But we didn’t want to take a chance. We have a decent team without Angelo, but replacing him will be tough. It will be like trying to replace Sanga or Mahela,” said Gurusinha.
Malinga for Champions Trophy?
Commenting on Lasith Malinga’s hat-trick, Gurusinha said, “I don’t think anyone has to explain about Lasith. He has taken so many hat-tricks and he is a legend. His knowledge of cricket is unbelievable. He is a top performer and he performs at his top. He hasn’t played lot of cricket in the last 10 to 12 months. Playing T-20s and 50 overs are totally different. We will watch him closely at the IPL. He has got about 15 to 20 games if he plays all the games. The best thing is that he wants to go to England with us for the Champions Trophy. I am hoping he will. We will get an idea as to how well he is going. Fifty-over games mean that he has to bowl ten overs and field 50 overs. That’s where he is a little worried. We are waiting for some good news by end of April.”
‘It’s great if Hathu can come back to us’
It is a well known fact that Bangladesh’s rise as a cricket nation has taken place after Chandika Hathurusingha, the former Sri Lanka cricketer and coach took charge of them three years ago.
“I am not surprised at what Hathu has done with Bangladesh. I am happy that a friend and a Sri Lankan has achieved great things,” said Gurusinha.
“He has been with them for three years and has taken them to new heights. I had got to know Hathu in 1986. The under-19 team when I was captaining I knew his vast cricketing knowledge. We have Graham Ford. He is contracted with us till the 2019 World Cup. Hathu is contracted till 2019 World Cup as well with Bangladesh. If he comes to Sri Lanka one day it will be great for us,” he said.
