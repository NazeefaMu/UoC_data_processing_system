Locally manufactured dental chairs to be purchased for health institutions

 
The Health Ministry said that Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne has ordered health officials to purchase dental chairs manufactured locally for the use of state health institutions.
According to sources, one locally made dental chair costs only Rs. 550,000. But it costs Rs. 2.5 million to import a dental chair from a foreign country.
Locally made dental chairs are similar to the dental chairs imported from Europe the Minister has said.
Minister Senaratne has ordered Acting Director General of Health Services Dr. Jayasundara Bandara to buy the locally made dental chair manufactured by Tissomed Technologies owned by Mr. Kulendra Raja.
Minister Senaratne has inspected the chair at Thilippalei Cancer Hospital and stated that local entrepreneurs should be assisted.
