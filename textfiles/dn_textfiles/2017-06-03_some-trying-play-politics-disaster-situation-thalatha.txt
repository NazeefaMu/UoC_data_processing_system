Some trying to play politics with disaster situation: Thalatha

Some groups are trying to gain political mileage out of the emergency disaster situation in the country, Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorala said.
Minister Athukorale pointed out, while the government and the private sector are on a mission to provide immediate relief to victims of the disaster, some groups are trying to take political advantage out of the situation.
“In a disaster, people are victimised despite their differences. Therefore, it is the responsibility of a government to provide facilities to these people treating them as equals. While compensating the affected, we will take precautionary measures against impending disasters as well,” Minister Athukorale said. She also pointed out, unlike the previous regime which paid only Rs.15,000 as compensation per victim, the present government is paying Rs.100,000 as compensation for death of each victim.
