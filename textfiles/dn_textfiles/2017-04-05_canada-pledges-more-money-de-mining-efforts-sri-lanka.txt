Canada pledges more money for de-mining efforts in Sri Lanka

Canada is pledging new money to help clear landmines in Sri Lanka and Ukraine, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland announced before she left to attend an international demining event held at Kensington Palace in London Tuesday.
Canada’s announcement comes as the international community marks the International Day for Mine Awareness and Assistance in Mine Action today.
The new funding includes $1.9 million over three years to find and clear landmines in northern Sri Lanka, which will allow residents in the affected areas to resume their livelihoods in agriculture and the fishery.
It also includes more than $3.8 million for education, training and mine-clearance activities in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, Freeland announced.
