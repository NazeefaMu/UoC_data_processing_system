Bathing at Anuradhapura  tanks to be banned

The National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) has conducted a comprehensive study on impacts from uncontrolled human activities in reservoirs during religious seasons and festivals in Anuradhapura.
Anuradhapura has several large tanks, used mainly for the water requirement of humans, fish and wildlife and also for flood control.
The NWSDB’s monthly analyses of water sample of the Tissawewa, Thuruwilawewa, Nuwarawewa, Nachchaduwawewa and Rajanganewewa tanks finds that that the E. coli count in the water from Tissawewa increases significantly during the middle of every year. The percentage of E. coli has been increasing gradually from 2013, when the NWSDB started testing the water samples.
The reason for higher values of E. coli towards mid-year can be attributed to the intensive human activities related to the tank during the Poson festival in Anuradhapura. During this period, a large number of devotees visit Anuradhapura and use water from these tanks for bathing. The data very clearly indicates a midyear trend of increasing E. coli count.
The NWSDB has recommended that human activities around the tanks are restricted as water from these tanks is used for consumption after being treated. The Tissawewa tank has the highest risk of pollution due to its smaller size.
At the recent Anuradhapura national Poson festival steering committee meeting, it was decided to ban bathing at Nuwarawewa and Tissawewa during the forthcoming Poson festival to prevent water pollution.
