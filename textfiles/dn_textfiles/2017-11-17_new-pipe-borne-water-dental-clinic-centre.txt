New pipe borne water for Dental Clinic Centre

A new pipe borne water supply to provide drinking water to the Dental Clinic Centre near the Akkaraipattu National School in the Akkaraipattu DS division is underway.
A new building complex for Akkaraipattu Dental Clinic Centre was constructed by the Health Department and opened for the use of the public about two months ago.
The Centre has been facing shortage of drinking water. This was brought to the notice of the authority by the public of the area.
Thereafter, the National Water Supply and Drainage Board and Health Department jointly provided a solution for it.
The newly constructed Akkaraipattu Health Centre also was opened recently by the Health Department and the people of this area are greatly benefited by this Health Centre.
