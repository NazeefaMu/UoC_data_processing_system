Sri Lanka Medical Nutrition association (SLMNA), Sri Lanka’s premier professional body of medical doctors specialised in clinical nutrition, organizes its Third Clinical Nutrition Annual Academic Sessions themed ‘Healthy Ageing’, on November 30 and December 1, at the Galle Face Hotel, Colombo.
Over 200 members of the SLMNA from across the country, serving both the state and the private sector, will attend the sessions.
The sessions will commence with a ceremonial inauguration on November 30. Prof. Matthias Pirlich, the General Secretary of European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN), Consultant Physician, Gastroenterologist and Endocrinologist of Imperial Oak Outpatient Clinic, Berlin, Germany, will deliver the keynote speech on “Establishing evidence-based nutrition – role of ESPEN guidelines.”
The academic programme on the following day will consist of three symposia by eminent local and foreign guest speakers, followed by abstract presentations.
SLMNA was established in 2015 by its Founder President, Consultant Medical Nutritionist, Dr. Renuka Jayatissa.
This organisation is dedicated to uplifting the standards of clinical nutrition throughout the country. Its primary goal is to yield a healthier nation through sustained provision of exceptional nutrition care in hospital and community settings islandwide.
To achieve this goal, numerous activities implemented by the SLMNA are currently underway. Development of clinical guidelines on nutritional management of various diseases which paves the path to incorporate nutritional management into conventional care is one of them. Furthermore, it provides a platform for continuous professional development for its membership and outstanding training facilities for those who are aspiring to be consultant nutrition physicians.
