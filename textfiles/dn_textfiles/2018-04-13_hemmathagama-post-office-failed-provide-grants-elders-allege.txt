Hemmathagama Post Office failed to provide grants, elders allege

Elders of the Hemmathagama village complained that the main post office of the area had failed to provide their annual grants, yesterday. Elders receive a grant of Rs. 2,000, they said and added that they had received grants prior to the Sinhala and Tamil New Year during the past years.
Post officers said that the Mawanella Divisional Secretariat office had not provided the money to the Hemmathagama post office.
The elders had been waiting at the post office for hours, while expecting to receive grants and some had even travelled for over three hours to get to the post office. The elders further said they arrived on Tuesday (11), only to be disappointed.
When inquired, the Mawanella Divisional Secretary said that the Divisional Secretariat had not said that the grants would be given before the New Year.
“We give these grants on April 15, every year. However, we would give the grant on April 16 as the 15th is a holiday. The Divisional Secretariat annually spends Rs. 4.3 million for these grants and we haven’t got the funding from the government yet. We have 250 adults in our division,” she added.
However the officials of the post office stated that the grants were given to the elders before the Sinhala and Tamil New Year during the past years.
