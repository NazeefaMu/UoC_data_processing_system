‘One million people in Sri Lanka suffer from asthma’

Sri Lanka has about one million estimated asthma patients and each year 1,000 of them succumb to the disease, Colombo National Hospital Senior Consultant and Respiratory Physician Dr. Kirthi Gunasekara said.
Sri Lanka has a higher number of asthma patients when it is compared with the number of asthma patients in other countries. Over 20 percent of children suffer from asthma. Of them, 12 percent are in a critical state. Over 20 percent of adults suffer from the disease.
He was addressing a <U+200B> press briefing held at the Information Department, Colombo yesterday to mark the ‘World Asthma Day’.
The theme of this year’s World Asthma Day was ‘A clean atmosphere, a clean environment and an end to the asthma disease.’ A panel of experts gave views on the statistics, symptoms, causes and medication related to the disease.
Dr. Gunasekara said the government should be more aware of the statistics and should work to mitigate the long-term disease through awareness programmes and researches.
“Asthma occurs as an inflammation of the respiratory tract. When the respiratory tract is more sensitive, the smooth muscles get tighter and the wall of the respiratory tract becomes thicker. When this happens, the area allocated for the flow of air is reduced and breathing diseases occur,” Consultant Respiratory Physician, Welisara National Hospital Dr. Suharshi De Silva said. She said symptoms of asthma include short of breath, noises while breathing and a dry cough during cold nights. “Air pollution, irritants in atmosphere, smoke emitted from vehicles, dust, pets, cigarettes and dust mites are some of the common causes of asthma. But causes differ from person to person,” she said.
Consultant Respiratory Physician and Senior Lecturer, University of Sri Jayawardenepura Dr. Chandimani Undugodage said medications could be given as per the symptoms of the patient. “Asthma can be controlled more effectively by using inhalers. Inhalers include relievers and preventers. The reliever inhaler should be used as soon as the symptoms are visible, while the preventer inhaler should be used daily as a long-term solution to reduce asthma,” she said.
“We are enhancing awareness among the citizens about the disease. A walk will take place on June 5 in Kandy to mark the World Environment Day and they could undergo free lung examinations in the Kandy City Centre,” Consultant Respiratory Physician, Hambantota District General Hospital Dr. Bodhika Samarasekara said.
