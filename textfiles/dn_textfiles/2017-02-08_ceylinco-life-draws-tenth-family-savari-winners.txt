Ceylinco Life draws tenth Family Savari winners

The winners of the grand prize in the tenth edition of Ceylinco ‘Family Savari’ promotion have been chosen.
Five policyholder families from Moratuwa, Nattandiya, Nugegoda, Matara and Ganemulla won an all-expenses-paid holiday in England at the Family Savari grand draw, while another ten families were selected for a visit to Dubai, a further 25 families for a tour of Singapore, and 250 families for a day at the Leisure World theme park.
These winners will be joined by another 25 families drawn at a mid-promotion draw for the Singapore tour and another 250 families that won a trip to Leisure World at the same mid-promotion draw.
A total of 2,260 people have now won overseas holidays or the local excursion from Ceylinco Life at this year's Family Savari, taking the total number of people benefitted by the promotion to date to nearly 20,000.
“It's been ten spectacular years, but the Ceylinco Life Family Savari remains the biggest, most anticipated and most engaging promotion in Sri Lanka's insurance industry,” Ceylinco Life Managing Director and CEO R. Renganathan said. “The focus of the promotion is to promote family bonding, and to many winners, the experience yields memories that last a lifetime.”
Over the past four years, Ceylinco Life has presented winners of the grand prize at the Family Savari with holidays in Japan (2014), Switzerland (2015) Germany (2016) and England (2017). Policyholders eagerly await the announcement of the new destination every year, when the promotion begins in August or September.
The promotion period for Family Savari 10 ended in December 2016. All active long term Ceylinco Life policyholders, holders of Ceylinco Life Retirement Accounts (CRAs) and new policyholders who purchased a policy and paid three months’ premium and kept their policies active were eligible to win these holidays. Depending on the size of their policies or the balances in their CRAs, some policyholders were eligible to qualify for the draws for all four categories of prizes. Ceylinco Life's Family Savari programme is promoted by four popular brand ambassadors, the Sri Lankan actors Sriyantha Mendis, Sanjeewani Weerasinghe and Roshan Ranawana and his wife Kushlani who join policyholders on their overseas holidays and on the local excursion.
Ceylinco Life has close to a million lives covered by active policies. The company is acknowledged as the benchmark for innovation in the local insurance industry for its work in product research and development, customer service, professional development and corporate social responsibility.
