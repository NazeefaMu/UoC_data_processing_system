Strong women in focus

Kangana Ranaut, who will be seen as ‘fearless Julia’, a leading actress who travels, performs and entertains soldiers of the British Indian Army in Vishal Bhardwaj’s period drama Rangoon, says the film is a perfect Women’s Day watch as it’s about a strong woman.
“In Rangoon, Julia is a strong female character and the story revolves around her. Therefore, I believe that this film is quite important for Women’s Day and perfect to enjoy on that occasion,” said Kangana on Monday night while interacting with media at Mumbai airport as she was leaving for Delhi. The movie has elements from the British era as it is based in the 1940s when India was fighting for independence.
The 29-year-old actor, who loves getting into the skin of her character, arrived at the airport in a vintage car, as Jaanbaaz Julia is seen travelling an exquisite vintage car in the film. “I felt very nice riding the vintage car. It’s a new experience for me,” Kangana said. India Glitz
