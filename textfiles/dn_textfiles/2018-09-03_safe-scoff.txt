Safe to scoff?

Many of us are scared to eat the food in our fridges when it’s “out of date” - but some foods actually last much longer than we’ve been led to believe.
You could unwittingly be wasting food by throwing it away for no reason as contrary to popular belief, not all foods have a definite expiry date. Here we reveal the ones you can keep long after the date on the label.
While some foods should always be chucked after their “use by” has passed, there are other guidelines you can take with a pinch of salt.
It is always wise to pay attention to the dates when it comes to meat, fish and seafood but plenty of other foods are perfectly fine to eat. Here are 18 foods you can safely eat past their use by date. From eggs to milk, here are their surprising findings.
Biscuits: Although your favourite snacks might lose some of their freshness once their best by date has passed, you can eat them for a few weeks after.
Dried pasta: While dry pasta usually comes with a long shelf life, you can push this to three years if it is stored in a cool, dry and airtight environment.
Canned goods: Most tinned food will come with a best before date that is years ahead, but adding on extra time won’t hurt you. As long as your cans are undamaged and stored somewhere cool away from direct light, then they can last four around four years.
Bread: The use by date on bread assumes you’ve left it out in the kitchen you can extend this by up to two weeks by keeping your loaf in the fridge.
Pickles: Preserved foods such as pickles can last for up to two years past their use by date if they’re stored in an airtight container in the fridge – but they may start to lose some of their crunchiness.
Eggs: If you keep your eggs in the fridge, you can eat them up to three weeks after the use by date. But, beware of any unpleasant odour when you crack them – this means they should be chucked.
Chocolate: As long as your chocolate tastes ok, you’re pretty much good to go. Sometimes a white film might form on older chocolate, which is caused by the sugar crystallising, but it won’t harm you.
Hard cheese: Mould is unable to penetrate harder cheeses such as cheddar, so you can cut off any mould and it will be safe to eat.
Frozen vegetables: If your veg is kept frozen, in theory, it can last indefinitely.
Yoghurt: As long the yoghurt hasn’t been opened, you can usually enjoy it for two weeks after the sell-by date.
Salad leaves: As long as your leaves haven’t gone mouldy, it’s perfectly safe to eat them past their use by.
Spirits: When taken care of properly, spirits such as whiskey can be kept open-endedly and the same goes for gin and vodka.
Milk: You may be worried about milk, but as long as it tastes and smells ok you can ignore the sell-by.
Soy sauce: Packed with salt, which acts a natural preservative. As long as you keep the bottle closed, soy sauce will remain usable and the condiment remains fresh for years after it’s unsealed.
Sugar: As long as sugar is stored in a cool container that’s air-tight against moisture, it will last indefinitely.
Honey: Technically, honey doesn’t go off as it is a natural antimicrobial, meaning it does not decay.
White rice: This refined grain has been packed with preservatives and packets that have not been opened, or grains that are sealed in an air-tight container, are unlikely to decay.
Vinegar: As vinegar is often used as a preservative, its shelf-life is indefinite.
