Dhananjaya de Silva was the only positive for us – Samaraweera

PALLEKELE, Sunday - In another ODI lost to South Africa, the only positive Sri Lanka could draw from it was the batting of Dhananjaya de Silva who scored a spirited 84 off 66 balls at the Pallekele International Stadium yesterday.
De Silva came to bat with his side five down for 124 and facing an enormous task of overhauling South Africa’s massive score of 363-7, and battled it out to take the total to 273 with a series of fluent strokes that somewhat put to shame the early loss of his team mates.
“It was a big target. We didn’t bowl well and gave away too many boundary balls. We gave away too many runs towards the end as well. When you are chasing that kind of score we had to be positive. Our top order hit a few good shots and that went to the fielders. Dhananjaya (de Silva) is the only positive for us. South Africa has outplayed us in all three games,” said acting head coach and batting coach Thilan Samaraweera at the post-match press conference.
“We are all disappointed that we lost 3-0. When we won the toss and decided to field we didn’t bowl too well with the new ball. Even the last ten overs we were below par, three overs went for more than 18 or 20 runs. That made it difficult. When you are chasing 360 you have to be positive. But the shots that we executed didn’t work out well,” he said.
Sri Lanka was dismissed for 285 in 45.2 overs which was their highest total in the series so far.
By inviting South Africa to bat first Samaraweera said that the team’s intention was to get two wickets in the first 10 overs. “We took one wicket but we ended up serving too many boundary balls early on. They batted well in the last ten overs. We were expecting this to be a good track after 2pm but unfortunately 360 is a huge target.”
Despite losing the series Samaraweera described the Lankan team as “good” and added: “When you are chasing that many, the top order has to play shots.
Those shots unfortunately went straight into the hands of fielders. When you are chasing that many you have to take a few risks. I am not too worried with that.
The first game we were disappointing. We are searching for that top three. Someone has to get a big hundred.”
AN INCREDIBLE FEELING GETTING TO THAT 100 – HENDRICKS
South Africa’s one drop batsman Reeza Hendricks who made a century on his ODI debut described the moment as “an incredible feeling”.
“Conditions were very good the wicket played so much like back home what we are used to. To score a hundred on debut is something that I never thought of. It is really special and an incredible feeling, more importantly it contributed to the team,” said Hendricks who was named man of the match.
Hendricks said that batting with Hashim Amla made his task easy.
“Our opening pair got us off to a good start although Quinny (de Kock) didn’t face as many balls. Batting with Amla with that calm effect he has being relaxed and comfortable at the crease allowed me to play my game,” said Hendricks.
“For me its special scoring a hundred on debut, it’s the start of many more. I was fortunate to get the opportunity today and contribute to the team. Going forward if I get a few more it will be good,” he said.
Hendricks replaced Aidan Markram in the side for this game.
