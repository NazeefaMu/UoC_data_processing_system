Protection Methodology for  Sri Lankan industrial sector

Sri Lankan industrial policy is mainly centered around the private sector. Many Sri Lankan industries are in existence for over 40 years while the others blossomed after 1977 after the country adopted the open economy principles. Local industries are in the forefront of the local supply chain for a long period of time for both consumer and capital goods. Popular brands are household names. Maliban, Munchee, Sisil, Keells, Cargills, Hayleys, Singer, Uswatte, Kist, Hemas, Finco, ACL, Raigam, KML, Siddhaleepa, Orange, Maharaja, KG, Watawala, Atlas, Nikado, American Premium, MD, Highland, Astra, Link and many other branded products will vouch for the consumer preferences for their products over the imported goods. Our manufacturers have successfully entered the export markets as well during the last few decades.
To ensure the successful continuation of these industries, the setting up of a “Fortune 300” Sri Lankan industrial umbrella could be the ideal tonic to feed our local consumers as well as to ensure good products at competitive prices for the overseas customers. The 300 entities would represent different industries. Later on, the umbrella could be extended to 500 companies to represent major companies in the local and export markets. All ventures in the umbrella will benefit from sharing of research work, synergy effects and formation of strong cartels.
The selections could be based on the following criteria:
1. Quantum of annual net forex earnings.
2. Strength of work force.
3. Number of years in existence in Sri Lanka.
4. Local and overseas market shares.
5. Financial stability.
6. Measures of good governance policies adopted.
7. Technological strength.
8. Staff benefits and average annual remuneration.
9. Green environmental standards.
10. Annual Tax revenue to the state coffers.
11. CSR initiatives (past, present and future).
Once the Fortune 300 umbrella is formed, strengthening of ventures in the umbrella could take place with state and overseas assistance to ensure the steady growth and “going concern” status of the members in the umbrella. The immediate beneficiaries would be the state with higher GDP growth levels coupled with additional taxes and the local consumer with price stability and higher quality products. The relevant chambers should take the lead in establishing the “Fortune 300” enterprises to achieve their vision and long term objectives by way of value addition to the selected enterprises. The purchasing power of the people would improve and level of public savings will rise paving the way for a higher standard of living.
Most of the local industrial business ventures are not quoted in the Colombo stock exchange. Encouragement should be provided to them to list in the bourse and reap multiple benefits. Some of the stable manufacturing concerns in our country hails from the British era and have reached great standards. They too are contributing lavishly to the state revenue by way of taxes and meeting the needs of the local and overseas markets. Fortification of all these industries is also important if we are to reach niche markets overseas.
The most prominent state agencies which could assist the rapid industrialization of our country are the Inland Revenue, Customs, Excise, Provincial/Municipal/urban councils and Pradeshiya Sabhas and of course the Board of Investment. The inland revenue, customs and excise department are involved with designing tax laws and collection of taxes. These institutions should always design their revenue earning measures in the most prudent manner to ensure the continuity of local/export markets through the local industrialists. The provincial/municipal/urban councils and Pradeshiya Sabhas should assist our industrial sector by granting prompt approvals and assistance whenever needed and also protecting the industries located in their respective areas by ensuring the non intervention by area politicians in a unlawful manner. They should also improve the infrastructure of their areas to assist the industrial concerns to ensure a smooth work flow without any temporary interruptions even.
The board of investment carries big responsibility on their shoulders to thwart foreign investors coming over here to compete with local industries for the local market. The foreign investors should be welcomed to invest in production of goods & services only for exports, especially for hit hereto untapped foreign markets ideally with latest technology and greener production methods. They should never be allowed to pose a threat to out industrial and agricultural industries. In 1978,the then government started the FIAC (foreign investment advisory commission) mainly to spearhead the foreign direct investment drive of Sri Lanka. A number of Free trade zones were established to woo the foreign investors. With the success of the Katunayake and Biyagama investment zones, the government established the more formalized Board of Investment. Over the years the BOI reached great heights and established more investment zones in various parts of the country. The investor flow continued even after the 1983 civil disturbances and subsequent escalation of violence in North and East. A vast number of Sri Lankans found employment in BOI enterprises set up by foreign investors. The carried out extensive promotion campaigns overseas with the assistance of our diplomatic missions abroad. However, the existing BOI legislation be subject to review in the best interests of the local industrialists and the already established BOI ventures in Sri Lanka whilst maintaining the investor friendly attitude and status to woo sizable new foreign direct investments. BOI should also take some credit for creating foreign employment to our youth especially in South Korea through its association with the Korean investor community in Sri Lanka. In 1994 MAY, The BOI took an eight member trade delegation along with the Prime Minister to Seoul to woo Korean investments and also to create employment opportunities for our youth in South Korea. The writer of this article was one of the consultants and a member of the 8 member trade delegation which included chairmen of a number of blue chip companies in Sri Lanka including JKH and Aitken Spence. We had lengthy discussions and presentations at KDI (Korea Development Institute) to secure investments and employment avenues for youth.
At present the BOI grants approval for new projects under two categories, i.e. section 16 and 17. Section 17 carries a number of concessions while the Section 16 investors will be subject to the normal laws prevailing in the country like any other business. Of late a number of foreign investors especially from SAARC countries have expressed their desire to set up manufacturing plants in Sri Lanka for the local market and also to import goods from overseas and engage in import trading activities. Their investment in the project is not at all sufficient to stake a claim as a worthy foreign investor. The exchange controller has issued a gazette notification in April 2002 to permit foreign investors to engage in retail trading (import and sell in local market) provided the foreign investor remits us$ 1 million to Sri Lanka for such purpose. This gazette was issued in 2002 over 15 years back before the end of hostilities in North and East. However, when one weigh in the factors like end of north/east war, improved infrastructure such as roads, logistics. this gazette be revised to permit foreign investors to set up manufacturing plants only for export purposes with a minimum investment of at least us$ 3 million and should do away with the import trade activities completely for the protection of local industrial sector. This is in the wake of our GSP plus status, uplifting of ban by European union for our fish/fishery products, new seaport and an airport in the South. For very paltry sums of foreign investment, we should not place our local industries under pressure and totally wipe off them in the future. We should redesign a clear cut policy to assist the local industries on a continuous basis.
Some salient factors towards this cause are tabulated below.
1. Investors especially from SAARC and African countries bring in relatively lower quantums of forex for their investment to set up a base here and engage in unlawful activities and send out large quantums of forex out of the country much more than their investment in a shorter period of time.
2. They will overvalue their plant and machinery and procure enhanced bank loans/facilities.
3. They will adopt fraudulent means to avoid local taxes
4. They may not pay statutory payments such as EPF and ETF for staff or at least delay same.
5. They will wind up business in Sri Lanka after recovering many times of their investment leaving huge liabilities to banks, unpaid salaries, local taxes, benefits and compensation to staff.
6. They will try to keep a substantial portion of foreign exchange overseas by inflated import values and depleted export values.
7. By the time they depart, a number of local industrial concerns may well have collapsed making a large number unemployed.
8. They will also try to bring in a large number of foreign workers for their industry. This will pose social and health issues for the whole country.
9. The export prices of our exporters may well fall, due to the low prices quoted by these new foreign investors for same markets in same countries.
10. The foreign investors will park their profits abroad creating an adverse forex situation for Sri Lanka.
11. After a few months they will discontinue with manufacturing and only engage in import trading totally wiping off the respective industries in Sri Lanka.
12. After wiping off the local industrial sector they will jack up the prices. The local consumers will have to pay very high prices for imported goods coupled with higher exchange rates due to rupee depreciation.
13. The trade deficit of the country will further go up due to high dollar demand for imported goods.
14. Our local industries will wind up business in Sri Lanka and invest in countries like Bangladesh. Bangladesh has already invited the Sri Lankan business community to set up business in their country.
Considering the adverse effects mentioned above, the BOI should suitably amend their existing laws in consultation with the chambers of commerce in Sri Lanka to protect the local industries and the local consumers. Considering the current plight of our industrial concerns and exporters, the following six pronged support scheme should be immediately implemented by the state.
1. A bank borrowing interest rate of 5% per annum for capacity expansion, product range expansion for export markets for generation of net forex earning of not less than us$ 350,000 additionally per year during the tenure of the loan or for creation of additional 100 job opportunities locally for above purposes. Approval of business loans/facilities for above purpose should be within 5 working days
2. Reduction of vat/other tax rates for all locally produced goods for local markets, back to a realistic level. This will boost turnover of local manufacturers.
3. Protection measures from BOI for long term existence.
4. Cutting off of red tape of local authorities and other state agencies.
5. Capital allowance rate of 33 1/3% on new plant & machinery for tax purposes.
No government can solve the burning social and economic problems of the country alone. They need the support of the industrial sector for employment creation, export forex earnings, to raise tax revenue, to bring down cost of living. The government should go hand in hand with the industrial sector to achieve its economic and other goals. Sadly, most governments have neglected this and allowed the industrial sector to weather all storms alone while raising taxes at adhoc times to raise revenue. Industrial growth rates are vital for steady GDP growth rates of a country. There are many state industrial ventures also which could be revived with local private sector assistance easily. We do not need any foreign investors to make such ventures viable. Over the years, successive governments put their political supporters vastly in excess of manpower needs for such ventures. Successive governments never sought the assistance of the private sector to manage such enterprises, fearing the loss of jobs for their political supporters. The treasury has been pumping large sums of money to meet the losses of such ventures through tax payer money.
I wish to point out a few remedial measures for a financially weaker company in any industry as given below.
1. Merge with a stronger company.
2. Obtain synergy effects from other companies in the industry.
3. Inviting strategic partners from overseas with a capital infusion to promote exports.
4. Restructure all existing loans for a longer period of time.
5. Reaching agreement with workers for a lower salary and monthly incentives based on attendance, productivity and profit bonus, overall cost reduction bonus. High fixed salaries will only increase the monthly fixed overhead.
6. Introduction of new products with high profit margins and discontinuance of low profit margin products.
7. Strengthen corporate governance measures.
8. Making the suppliers and buyers, the shareholders of the company.
9. Seek extended credit from suppliers and lower credit periods to buyers.
10. Product/product line innovation.
 
It is essential and of paramount importance to prop up our industrial sector even in areas like petroleum and other energy sources, so that our future import bills will come down. Import substitution industries would be the key for us to become a net foreign exchange earner. It may not be a bad idea to set aside 0.25% of VAT collected by the state for one year, to be placed in an industrial sector development fund. This industrial development fund could raise additional finance through foreign donor grants and financial assistance for specific projects from similar organizations abroad. Further, the foreign buyers may introduce advance monies to companies with buy-back agreements of products specially manufactured for them. By this way, a ready export market could be developed for industrial output. This fund could also raise a line of credit with foreign governments/agencies or with European Union to modernize all our industrial concerns to meet international standards. This is a very workable arrangement rather than waiting for foreign investors to come and invest. Once we set this scheme in motion, there will be a queue of foreign investors to invest in Sri Lanka. Further three nominee directors of chambers of commerce be appointed to the directorate of BOI along with three directors nominated by the Government.
Main objectives of this fund include the following.
1. Value addition to the entire industrial sector and specially selected industries and companies.
2. Tocarry out exclusive research on foreign markets, consumer preferences and changes in country trade policies.
3. To source out niche markets for our exporters.
4. To establish a new quality governance agency to meet the requirements of sectorial market segments in overseas countries, example Japanese, European Union, US, UK and other selected markets.
5. To set up exclusive investment zones in Sri Lanka with more investor friendly Labour Laws.
6. To widen raw material supply sources in Sri Lanka.
7. Promotion of investments from our own expatriates settled in overseas countries.
8. To strengthen foreign investment protection laws.
9. To improve the morale, job security and emoluments of industrial work force in Sri Lanka at all levels.
10. To set up a high- tech labour training institute with international standards.
11. To settle union action within hours and reach “win win” solutions.
