Reunited!

Dog lover Cheryl McCabe was a mum-of-one the last time she saw her beloved pooch Mitzy. Cheryl’s Patterdale Terrier vanished six years ago after being taken from the family’s
Middlesbrough garden. She spent fruitless months looking for Mitzy, who she’d owned for seven years and loved dearly.
It seemed as though she’d never be seen again - but this shaggy dog story has a happy ending. Two months ago, a vet got in touch to say that after all this time, Mitzy had been found.
Now the ‘perfect’ pet is back at the family’s Thorntree home and getting used to a much larger family. When she went missing, the only child at home was Cheryl’s son Elliot, then seven.
Now there’s not only Elliott but his brothers Charlie, five, Harry, three, and Freddie, nearly one - not forgetting Cheryl’s partner Gary Walker, a sausage dog, a Shih Tzu and a budgie!
Cheryl said: ‘I had given up hope - I really thought Mitzy was dead and that we would never see her again.
‘I’d had her since she was five weeks old. She was the perfect dog and I was devastated.
‘There wasn’t much social media six years ago so all I could do was put posters up and ask around the area, but she didn’t turn up.’
Mitzy was found near the A19 near Thirsk and taken into Skeldale Veterinary Centre, the original James Herriot practice where TV series The Yorkshire Vet is filmed. Using information on Mitzy’s microchip, veterinary nurse Zoe Jackson and vet Julian Norton turned ‘pet detective’ to track down her owner. And the team at Skeldale were stunned to discover Mitzy had been stolen six years ago.
Cheryl said: ‘I got a voicemail and had to listen to it four times because I couldn’t believe it.
‘I wasn’t sure she’d remember me after all this time so I was quite nervous when I went to pick her up.’
But Cheryl needn’t have been nervous as Mitzy, who had been unresponsive to Skeldale staff, wagged her tail for the first time since arriving and
immediately recognised her rightful owner, joyfully licking her face.
Cheryl, 32, said: ‘She’s greyer around the eyes now, which I wasn’t expecting - I guess I was still remembering the dog I had six years ago. But her lovely nature is just the same.
‘It just shows never to give up hope.’
Vet nurse Zoe said: ‘ It’s such an amazing feeling being able to reunite Mitzy with her owner after so long as well! This is why I’m a vet nurse,
this is why I come to work every day and do what I do.
‘We have never seen a case like this before and I’m fairly sure that I won’t see any case like this again.’
