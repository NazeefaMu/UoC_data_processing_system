Seminar for AL Art students held

A one-day seminar was held recently at the Puttalam Zahira National College A.H.M. Aswar hall in order to improve the skills of Art students who are to sit for their G.C.E (A.L.) examinations next year.
Around 88 students from 16 Tamil-medium schools that come under Puttalam Zonal Education Office participated in the seminar, which was organised by the district’s education office. Art Teacher Instructor M.M. Muhammed was the main facilitator.
Students who had failed their G.C.E. (A.L.) Art examination in their first attempt last year, as well as those who had obtained low marks in the subject in their schools’ first and second term exams, were taught how to enhance their performances.
Following the seminar, Muhammed said that all students who participated had drawn artworks worthy of A, B and C grades.
