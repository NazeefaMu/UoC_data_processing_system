Kumar Gunaratnam to enter political fray

Frontline Socialist Party politbureau member Kumar Gunaratnam, will enter the political fray with a pragmatic edge after completion of his paper work concerning Sri Lankan citizenship.
The party’s Leader Pubudu Jagoda yesterday, said they were happy to see him released from prison. His family, the relatives, well wishers and all those who supported us and all the members of the Frontline Socialist Party welcomed him eagerly.
“We offered Gunaratnam a key position in the Party as its Organizing Secretary. We have received a letter from the Immigration and Immigration Department stating that Gunaratnam resides in Sri Lanka and that his citizenship in Sri Lanka would be completed after the paperwork of cancellation of his citizenship in Australia,” he said.
“It is being worked out,” he said and added,” Gunaratnam has expressed his keenness to enter politics in the country. He is our most talented and experienced political activist.”
Asked if there was any chance as a leftist political party that they might stand side by side with the Janatha Vimukthi Permuna (JVP), Jagoda said they stand with the JVP on the issue of SAITM. Other than that, we have our principles to go about in the context of our political agendum, he said.
Gunaratnam was arrested on November 4, 2015, on charges that he had violating visa regulations after arriving in the country on a tourist visa.
