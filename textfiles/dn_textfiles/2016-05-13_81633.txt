Issue was resolved because of a elected body – Sports Minister

 
 Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera said that Sri Lanka was able to handle the doping issue concerning cricketer Kusal Perera successfully because there was a democratically elected body in place.
“If there was no elected body in place today I don’t think we would have been able to save Kusal Perera,” said Minister Jayasekera.
“This is the lesson learnt by everyone today. We were in the ICC only as an observer and did not have any status to be part of being a decision-making representative.“Today Thilanga Sumathipala as the elected president of SLC can go to the ICC and make representations on behalf of Sri Lanka.
“All this time we did not have that status because of an interim committee. This is the right decision this government has taken. Sumathipala can take up any issues concerning Sri Lanka and thrash it out with the ICC,” he said.
The Minister also further stated Perera had suffered a financial loss in his career by the ban or he could have been chosen to play in the IPL and earned millions of rupees.
“He was deprived of playing is many international games. As Sports Minister I am very much concerned for the player because and for SLC it was a big loss because had he been available for selection we could have performed much better in the World T20,” said Jayasekera. “All this we need to discuss with the ICC and expect Sumathipala to do so in a very cordial manner.” - ST
