Power outages in flood-hit districts restored: Siyambalapitiya

Power has been restored to residents in flood-ravaged districts. Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya yesterday said they have restored 99 percent of the power outages caused by the floods.
The flood situation devastated around 627,000 residential power connections, and regional power supply systems, he said..
“The outage caused by the disaster has been fully restored by Ceylon Electricity Board workers,” the minister said.
“All affected households will have electricity from today,” he said.
CEB officials and crews worked day and night on electricity outages over the past few days, he said.
“They have replaced power poles and repaired disconnected lines under trying conditions,” he said, and added, “ I am proud of them as the Power and Renewable Energy Minister for they have repaired the damage in such a short time.”
