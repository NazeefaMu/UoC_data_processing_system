Yala National Park administration under heavy criticism

The administration of the Yala National Sanctuary has come under heavy criticism due to various reasons.
Yala National Park has gained wide popularity among tourists around the globe. The visitors to the park said that food such as short eats and other consumer items at the restaurant are sold at exorbitant prices for local sightseers, animal lovers and foreigners. The visitors said that two Wades and two bottles of milk are sold at Rs.1,000. A bottle of water which is only Rs. 50 is sold at Rs.150. Although there are no proper toilets, wash room facilities and sanitary facilities, the visitors are compelled to pay Rs 100 to Rs. 200 to use them. The safari jeep drivers said that they have to wait in long queues for their turn for hours.
Efforts of this correspondent to inquire about these allegations over the phone proved futile.
