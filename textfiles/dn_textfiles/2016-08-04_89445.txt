It should be  ‘Padhada  Yathra’: Harin

 
The Pada Yathra which was conducted by the Joint Opposition under the theme 'Jana Satana Pada Yathra' did not mention the issues faced by the public during the past 18 months, nor did they level a single allegation against the present government. They used it only to criticize President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Minister of Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Harin Fernando said.
In 1992, a Pada Yathra was held against the government, as the people were disappointed with the 15 years of their rule. But this time, the Pada Yathra was held just one and half years after the Good Governance regime came to power and there was no justified reason for it. So this cannot be proclaimed as a Pada Yathra, it was a 'Padhada Yathra', he explained.
“No Pada Yathra of this sort was allowed during the previous regime. But we, the present government let it finish in a very peaceful manner. During the previous regime, they did not allow us to march a kilometer against them and they used gangsters, tear gas and water cannons to stop us. But we did not do so, as this Pada Yathra was not a challenge to the present government.”
“The former president and Kurunegala District MP is now claiming that the present IGP is a thug. We could not control our laughs as we know the way his henchmen treated the senior police officers during his rule. Meanwhile, Kandy District MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage is saying that more than two million people participated in the Pada Yatra on the final day, August 01 at Lipton Circus. As I know, he failed math though he was a Royalist.”
“I know that we are not perfect and we too have our faults. But at present we are making an effort to rebuild our motherland which had been ruined by the previous regime. When we are making such an effort, the joint opposition is holding Pada Yathra and criticizing the President and Prime Minister using foul language. In spite of that, they have used a child to criticize the President, which is a cheap and shameful act," Fernando further said.
Addressing a press briefing held at the United National Party (UNP) Headquarters, Sirikotha, Fernando said that Rajapaksa, his eldest son Namal Rajapaksa and their henchmen have gone crazy over their defeat and greed for power. Hence they have no idea about what they do.
Namal believes that walking in a Pada Yathra is a qualification to become the future president of Sri Lanka, as his father had done it in 1992. However throughout this procession the public saw how the participants behaved.
If they organized it to address the issues faced by the public under the Good Governance regime, how can they dance along the roads, criticize others or travel in vehicles eating ice cream?, he questioned.
The public issues cannot be solved by walking along the roads with gangsters, murderers, louts and tramps. It is like walking in front of the public naked.
The person who made a teacher kneel in school and the one who killed a British National and raped his girl friend during the previous rule, have also taken part in the Joint Opposition's Pada Yathra.
That is why I call it the 'Padhada Yathra,' he further stated.
