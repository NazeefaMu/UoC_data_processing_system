Publish Delimitation Commission Report: CaFFE

 
The Campaign for Free and Fair Elections (CaffE) made an open request from the Local Government and Provincial Councils Ministry to publish the report of the Delimitation Commission through a gazette notification as soon as possible.
The CaFFE, which said that the Delimitation Commission had done an excellent job in formulating its report, said it should be gazetted within two days after submission to the relevant minister.
The CaFFE said formulating the report delayed due to various reasons including poor facilitation and this had delayed finalising the report.
