Lester broke away from norm to produce great cinema - PM

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe speaking at the state funeral of Dr. Lester James Peries, paid tribute to his perseverance in breaking away from the norm to produce great cinema for Sri Lanka and the world over.
“In a time where local cinema was filled with remakes of Indian cinema, it was Dr Lester James Peries who decided to break away from the norm and produce Rekhawa,” said the Prime Minister, speaking at Independence Square.
“When Rekhawa was shown many said the film was over and that he would revert to the norm but he did not give up. He directed six more in the 1960s. Between 1960-1980 he directed 14 films”.
We are thankful to him for that. If he did not have that strength to persevere we would not have had Sinhalese or Sri Lankan cinema, he said.
Recalling fond memories of his time with the late Dr. Peries, the Prime Minister noted that having grown up with his movies, one of the last members of his parent’s era had passed away.
“I met him at his residence on his birthday recently. I was surprised at his memory and he gave me a painting done by his brother Ivan Peries”.
He further noted that Dr. Peries also had a record for turning novels in films with many of his films being sourced from them.
“My deepest sympathies to Sumithra and her family,”the Prime Minister said.
Dr. Peries was 99 at the time of passing.
