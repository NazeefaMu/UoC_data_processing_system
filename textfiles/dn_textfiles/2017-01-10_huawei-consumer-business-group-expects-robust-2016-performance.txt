Huawei Consumer Business Group expects robust 2016 performance

Huawei Consumer Business Group predicts a sales revenue of 178 billion RMB, 42% up from a year ago, achieving steady growth for the fifth consecutive year.
Smartphone shipments also reached 139 million units with 29% year-on-year growth; according to IDC, the increasing rate of global smartphone shipments was only 0.6% in 2016, which means Huawei is outperforming the overall market.
Richard Yu, Huawei CBG CEO, said, “Despite tough market conditions Huawei CBG is still growing at an industry-leading pace. This can be attributed to our consumer-centric approach that focuses on creating meaningful innovation, as well as our ongoing commitment to building a premium brand and reinforcing our global channels and service capabilities.
In 2017, we will strengthen our supply chain, channels, R&D, services and several other areas required to help us streamline our operations, improve the efficiency of our decision-making and implementation, drive our internationalization strategy and proactively develop future capacity.”
While the global smartphone industry is slowing down and lacks innovation, Huawei CBG builds on its product leadership and leads a new trend of industry innovation by pioneering ground-breaking developments in critical technology areas.
In 2016, Huawei CBG has focused on developing meaningful innovations and has made breakthroughs in the areas of operating system (EMUI based on Android), dual-camera technology, artificial intelligence and more.
For the operating system, in order to solve the issue of Android phones slowing down over time, which has frustrated Android users for years, Huawei’s software R&D team conduct in-depth optimization on the Android system. Based on this work, Huawei unveiled EMUI 5.0 - software that is deeply integrated with the Kirin chipset and contains 20+ Huawei patented technologies, to take full advantage of the combination of Huawei software and hardware.
This includes highly optimized system resource allocation controlled by a smart learning system and further optimized Android system applications - resolving the long-term Android performance flaw and bringing a brand new Android experience to users.
