Wayamba CM won’t dissolve Council before its expiry

Wayamba Chief Minister Dharmasiri Dassanayake said people have given him a mandate for five years and as such he is not prepared to dissolve the Council and go for another election before the expiry of his five year term.
He said this when he was asked whether a Provincial Council election will be held in Wayamba along with the other Provincial Council elections announced for this year by the government.
He said the Council had another one and a half years to go before its 5 year term expired.
As such there was no need to jump the gun as the Council would automatically stand dissolved after the lapse of the five year term.
