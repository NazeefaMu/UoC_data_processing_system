Amid praise and blame

The Brahmajala Sutta is the first of 34 suttas in the Digha Nikaya. The sutta starts with the Buddha travelling with his disciples between the cities of Rajagaha and Nalanda. At the same time, a Brahmin called Suppiya, with his young apprentice, Brahmadatta, was also travelling in the same direction, tailing the convoy of the sangha. Suppiya uttered some insulting words about the Buddha, his teachings, and his disciples. However, Brahmadatta praised and revered the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha. The duo continued debating until they arrived at the King's resting place in Ambalatthika.
Hearing this conversation, some monks discussed the nature of conflict the next morning. The Buddha arrived and asked what they were discussing. As a monk finished telling him, the Buddha responded:
"Monks, if anyone spoke words which insult me, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, don't let this thing prompt you to hate, take revenge, and turn against them. If, because of this, you become angry or annoyed, then it will become an obstacle in your quest to liberate yourself and cause you upset.
However, if someone speaks insulting or false accusations about me, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, then you should state which is wrong and point out the mistake by explaining that because of this proof and that, then that is not true, or it is not like that, that kind of thing is not us or occurring in us."
Final liberation
"But if someone praises me, the Dhamma, or the Sangha; don't let this thing make you feel proud, joyful, and happy. If you act like that, then it will become an obstacle in your efforts to achieve your own final liberation. If someone speaks like that, you should state which is right and show the fact by saying, 'Based on this and that fact, it is indeed so; that thing does indeed exist in us, or is true about us.' Even only due to small matters, worthless, or even due to the Precepts (Sila)."
This is a vivid account in one of the earliest Buddhist texts describing how the Buddha guided his disciples in responding skillfully to both praise and blame.
The story is full of his wisdom about how we can avoid harming ourselves or others through our speech and how we can navigate through life while maintaining (sati) mindfulness and (upekkha) equanimity.
Feedback
In Dhammapada under Kodhavagga: the Buddha says, “O Atula! Indeed, this is an ancient practice, not one only of today: they blame those who remain silent, they blame those who speak much, they blame those who speak in moderation. There is none in the world who is not blamed”
As the Buddha says, blame is universal. It’s quite natural that all of us want to be appreciated for our generosity, noted for our courage, and lauded for our acumen. We generally prefer being told that we are adored. But how about the blame factor?
If we are only happy when universally, uniformly, entirely praised - if we are not happy when there’s any disagreement, or a single frowning face, or a random slur coming our way - it appears we won’t be happy very often.
As yourself few questions: Can I accept in humility, the negative feedback and reproach and disapproval, rather than just disavow it in a fit of irritation? At the same time, can I look at the blame with an open mind for what I might learn while also holding it in the larger context of wisdom - “There is always blame in this world”?
Can I look toward my motivation to speak or act to determine the worthiness of my action? Can I be discerning about whether or not I acted skilfully, without deciding that praise means I have nothing to learn, or any blame means I’ve failed? If I cannot, I have an issue. I will continually give your heart over to a shifting world of praise and blame that I can never finally control. I will continue to get your heart broken as my expectations are thwarted and my measures of success are challenged.
Anger
When we are blamed we feel under attack, and defensive instincts kick in physically and emotionally. Our stomachs tighten, our mouths become dry, our shoulder muscles tense - but we usually don’t notice these responses, and we often don’t even notice consciously that we are feeling ‘angry, resentful or upset’. Our attention is drawn instead to the thoughts that spring up in our mind in response to the attack. We think to ourselves, ‘He hurt me, he abused me.’
The answer is in the reason the Buddha gives for not getting defensive: ‘That would only be a hindrance to you.’ In other words, the emotional hooks that join us to emotions like anger or disappointment also fasten us to painful and reactive ways of thinking and, in the end, these will hurt us (to say nothing of the people with whom we are angry).
The Buddha taught that we are constantly being pulled in one direction or another by things or conditions we either want or hope to avoid.
These include praise and blame, pleasure and pain, success and failure, gain and loss. The wise person, the Buddha said, accepts all with upekkha, without approval or disapproval.
Theravada monk and scholar, Bhikkhu Bodhi, says the word upekkha means is to not be ruled by passions, desires, likes and dislikes.
The Bhikkhu continues, "It is evenness of mind, unshakeable freedom of mind, a state of inner equipoise that cannot be upset by gain and loss, honour and dishonour, praise and blame, pleasure and pain. Upekkha is freedom from all points of self-reference; it is indifference only to the demands of the ego-self with its craving for pleasure and position, not to the well-being of one's fellow human beings."
Upekkha
In the Lokavipatti Sutta, the Buddha points out, “Now, gain arises for a well-instructed disciple of the Buddha. He reflects, 'Gain has arisen for me. It is inconstant, stressful, & subject to change.' He discerns it as it actually is. Pain arises. He reflects, 'Pain has arisen for me. It is inconstant, stressful, & subject to change.' He discerns it as it actually is.
His mind does not remain consumed with the gain or the loss or with the status or the disgrace or the censure or the praise.
He does not welcome the arisen gain or rebel against the arisen loss. He does not welcome the arisen praise or rebel against the arisen blame. He does not welcome the arisen pleasure or rebel against the arisen pain. He is released from suffering and stress.
Kinds of happiness
The Buddha teaches us that there are three kinds of happiness: Sense pleasures (amisa sukha), Mundane meditative pleasures (jhanica sukha) and Nibbanic (niramisa sukha)
Amisa sukha is the pleasures all of us are familiar with. We like to indulge in sense pleasures. We like to see beautiful pictures or people; hear soothing music; taste good food, etc. The drawback with sense pleasures is that they lastsonly while one is satisfying the particular sense faculty; as soon as we finish eating, for example, the pleasure goes away.
Niramisa is opposite of amisa; thus niramisa sukha does not arise due to material things. It is totally mental, it is, in fact, the happiness due to release or dissociation from material things.
It is more of a relief sensation rather than an enjoyment. It is like the feeling when a pulsating headache goes away; a sense of calm and peacefulness.
The niramisa sukha of a Sotapanna (or above) is never lost. Even before the Sotapanna stage, one can start feeling the niramisa sukha by systematically removing greed, hate, and ignorance.
