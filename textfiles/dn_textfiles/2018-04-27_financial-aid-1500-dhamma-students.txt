Financial aid for 1,500 dhamma students

In accordance with the state Vesak festival, one thousand five hundred low-income dhamma school students would be offered with financial assistance to continue their studies, while about 1,000 novice monks would be provided with stationery and robes.
About 2,500 conferences would be held for 35,000 Buddhist students of both, the Kurunegala and Puttalam districts of the North Western Province during the Vesak week that would commence from April 26 and continue until May 2. In addition, training programmes for 2,000 Buddhist monks would be held and about 800 male Buddhist children would be ordained at Buddhist temples countrywide to mark the event, Buddhasasana Ministry Secretary Chandrapema Gamage said, while addressing a meeting for journalists held yesterday at the Bingiriya Devagiri Raja Maha Viharaya.
