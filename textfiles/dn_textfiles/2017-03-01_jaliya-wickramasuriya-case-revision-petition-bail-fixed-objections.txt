Jaliya Wickramasuriya case: Revision petition for bail fixed for objections

 The bail revision petition filed by former Sri Lankan Ambassador to the United States Jaliya Wickramasuriya challenging Colombo Fort Magistrate’s decision to refuse bail, was yesterday fixed for argument on March 13.
Meanwhile, the counsel appeared on behalf of the petitioner informed High Court Judge Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne that they were expecting to file an amended revision petition on the next date. Former Sri Lankan Ambassador to the United States Jaliya Wickramasuriya arrested for allegedly misappropriating USD 330,000 out of USD 6.6 million allocated for purchasing a building for the Sri Lankan Embassy, had been ordered to be further remanded till March 9 by the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court. At a previous occasion, Jaliya Wickramasuriya was brought to the Court premises by prison officials in an ambulance and subsequently brought to the Court room in a hospital patient bed. Thereafter, he was ordered to be admitted to a private hospital.
Filing this bail revision petition in the High Court, President’s Counsel Shavendra Fernando moved to revise the Fort Magistrate’s order to refuse bail for the suspect on a number of occasions.
The defence had moved Magistrate’s Court that the suspect’s health condition (heart patient) be also considered as an exceptional circumstance to release the suspect on bail.
While refusing to grant bail, the Magistrate further observed that the suspect’s health condition cannot be considered as an exceptional circumstance since the Colombo National Hospital can provide treatment for such an illness.
The FCID alleged that the suspect had misappropriated the amount during the purchase of a building to house the Sri Lankan embassy at 3025, White Haven Street, Washington 20008. The former ambassador had remitted this money to Sri Lanka. The former ambassador is a close relative of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
