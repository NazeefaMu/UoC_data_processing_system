Complete a degree whilst still in school at ESOFT

ESOFT, a premier private sector higher education network in Sri Lanka with over 40 branches islandwide, offers qualifications from various esteemed international partners who are mostly from the UK and is an institution offering a wide range of demand-driven qualifications.
Having recognised the need for young individuals to possess a degree as a basic qualification for job application, ESOFT has decided to launch the all-new Teen Graduate Program. Designed for gifted youngsters studying in grade 7, 8 or 9, this program ensures that teens are armed with a valid degree while they study for their A/L exams. The Teen Graduate Program would also act as a boost for students that learn IT in school. When a student in grade 7, 8 or 9 joins the Teen Graduate Program at ESOFT, they first go through a foundation program with selected components from one or more of ESOFT’s Pearson assured Diploma Programs. The foundation level focuses on improving English and IT skills to improve the child’s capability and maturity to a level that allows them to study a First Year Degree curriculum.
The First Year is the Certificate level awarded by BCS HEQ, which is a professional qualification awarded by the British Computer Society, the Chartered Institute for IT. The Certificate course which is the equivalent of Year 01 of a University Honours Degree in England (UK NQF level 4) covers the essential core subjects of ICT with 3 mandatory modules.
The Second Year, which is the Diploma level, is also awarded by BCS HEQ. It covers a mandatory core module - Professional Issues in IS practice, and a choice of 3 modules out of a total of 9, depending on the student’s selected career path. The qualification is equivalent to Year 02 of a University Honours Degree in England (UK NQF level 5).
The BCS HEQ is accessible to anyone regardless of entry qualifications and allows children to be channelled towards a clear path to an IT degree.
The Third Year is a Top-Up Degree awarded by London Metropolitan University UK, a public research university that dates back to 1848. Renowned for their graduates’ employability, the university offers about 160 academic programmes ranging from undergraduate to postgraduate qualifications.
