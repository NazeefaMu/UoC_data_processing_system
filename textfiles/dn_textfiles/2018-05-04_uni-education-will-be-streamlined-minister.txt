Uni Education will be streamlined: Minister

The University Education will be re-streamlined very soon to resolve the problems that undergraduate undergo and stop their unrest, Higher Education Minister Dr. Wijeydasa Rajapakshe said.
He was addressing the gathering after assuming the office at the Higher Education Ministry on Wednesday.
The Minister said that mainly he would prepare a mechanism to make university students happy and engage in their education constructively.
“University students are now victims of power hungry political parties and wasting their valuable time. They even lost their lives due to political victimization,” the Minister said.
Minister Rajapakshe said parents sent their children to universities amidst numerous difficulties to provide them with the maximum benefits from the university education. “Once they enter to universities, they become hostages of some political parties,” the Minister said..
The Minister said undergrads’ issues should be identified to create a better educational environment for them. He said the current situation can be changed along with the stakeholders of the university system.
