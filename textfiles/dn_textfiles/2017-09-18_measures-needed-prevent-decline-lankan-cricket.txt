Measures needed to prevent decline of Lankan cricket

Something should be done to prevent the decline of cricket in Sri Lanka. Talented members should be selected to the cricket team. Today’s problem is with the cricket administration. Steps should be taken according to the law of the country to preserve the game of cricket for the future, said the Most Ven.Warakagoda Sri Gnanaratne Mahanayake Thera of the Asgiriya Chapter.
The Asgiriya Prelate expressed these sentiments when Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga called on him at his temple in Kandy and received his blessings recently.
Earlier, Minister Ranatunga visited the Sri Dalada Maligawa and paid homage to the Sacred Tooth Relic and thereafter called on the Malwatte Prelate at his temple and received his blessings.
The Minister also briefed the two Mahanayake Theras about the future programme of work envisaged by his ministry.
Speaking to the media, Minister Ranatunga said both Mahanayake Theras requested him to take charge of the cricket administration and prevent its further decline, when asked by the media as to why he did not attend a cricket workshop organised by the Sports Ministry recently, Ranatunga said the workshop should have been organised by the Sports Ministry. But, it was not so because the telephone number given in the invitation card to acknowledge presence was not the telephone number of the Sports Ministry, but one belonging to a person called Gayathri attached to Sri Lanka Cricket. “This proved that the workshop was a ruse adopted by Sri Lanka Cricket to tide over the present problems encountered by it,” alleged Minister Ranatunga.
