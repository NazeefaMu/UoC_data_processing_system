Bernard Botejue joins hands with ReForest Sri Lanka for greener tomorrow

An environmental project was witnessed in Ratnapura recently, spearheaded by one of the oldest apparel manufacturing company in Sri Lanka.
Implemented under its key annual CSR initiative, Bernard Botejue Industries joined hands with ReForest Sri Lanka to reforest seven acres of land in Ratnapura.
The timely initiative was of great significance as it was recorded as the largest single-day reforestation project that has taken place in the history of Sri Lanka with the planting of 4,000 trees.
The event was held with the participation of a large number of volunteers including the employees and staff of Bernard Botejue, members of ReForest Sri Lanka as well as the residents of the area.
Forests are rapidly dwindling due to various reasons including climate change, global warming and human interventions. A considerable number of bush fires were reported towards the end of 2016 and the situation continued in early 2017 destroying acres of land in forest reserves.
Bush fires not only destroy primeval trees, wildlife, and eco-systems, but also have a drastic impact on the climate and dry up water sources and springs, which in turn causes water scarcity throughout the island.
Janaka Botejue environmental enthusiast and Chairman of Bernard Botejue Industries, expressing his views over this momentous project said, “We began this reforestation initiative last year by distributing 850 samplings to all the workers of Bernard Botejue Kolonna and the residents of the area to be planted as a part of the factory's anniversary celebration."
Unlike projects that give instant results, this initiative will be different as it contributes to the bigger picture of the deteriorating environment we live in.
The thousands of trees we planted today will not only purify the air and enrich the soil, but also help the country immensely to restore its receding forest coverage and refill water springs in the long run.I would like to take this opportunity to thank ReForest Sri Lanka for the invaluable support they have extended to us throughout this initiative."
Bernard Botejue Industries (Pvt.) Ltd. was established by Bernard Botejue back in 1948. Growing from its humble beginnings, Bernard Botejue today has diversified its business making strong foot prints in scores of industries and sectors including apparel manufacturing, luxury travel, and state of the art music studios.
The tree planting Project of Bernard Botejue Kolonna in collaboration with ReForest Sri Lanka took place under the guidance and purview of S.M. Samarasinghe, the Divisional Secretary of Kolonna.
Initiator and Partner of ReForest Sri Lanka Achela Meddegama said, “It's a great privilege to partner with Bernard Botejue Kolonna, a company that has been well known for generations in the apparel industry"
