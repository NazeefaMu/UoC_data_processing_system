Prof. Rohan Lucas High Voltage Laboratory opens at University of Moratuwa

A modern High Voltage Laboratory and Testing Facility was ceremonially opened at the Department of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Moratuwa on October 17, under the patronage of Chancellor of the University of Mortuwa, Prof. K K Y W Perera as the Chief Guest, Chief Executive Officer of LTL Holdings, Eng U D Jayawardana as the Guest of Honour and Vice Chancellor, Prof. Ananda Jayawardna, Dean of the Engineering Faculty.
A fully-fledged modern high voltage laboratory was a long-felt need for the university education and the electrical engineering industry of Sri Lanka. This laboratory has been named after Prof Rohan Lucas as a gratitude for the dedicated long service over 45 years for high voltage engineering education of the university and the country.
The laboratory consist of High Voltage Impulse Generator, High Voltage AC Test System, High Voltage DC Test System, Artificial Rain Making Equipment and associated control equipment and auxiliary devices. The laboratory is capable of High Voltage Impulse Tests, High Voltage AC and DC tests up to 500kV and 300kV respectively at different environmental conditions.
LTL Holdings has joined hands with the university as the industrial sponsor in construction of the laboratory. This is as another CSR project by LTL to up held the university education in Sri Lanka. The cost of laboratory was approximately Rs 35 million out of which laboratory renovation and civil construction works around Rs 5 million was sponsored by LTL Holdings.
This lab facility will be of immense support to undergraduate and post graduate engineering students for their laboratory experiments, design and research projects and for the high voltage research group of the University led by Prof Rohan Lucas and Dr Rasara Samarasinghe. Further, this testing facility is capable of carrying out HV Transformer Testing, HV Cable Testing, Meter Testing, HV Insulator and Bushing Testing, HV Switchgear Testing, HV CT/PT/ and CVT Testing, which has been a long-standing vacuum in the industry. This is the only test facility in Sri Lanka of its kind and includes an impulse generator test set, HVAC test set and HVDC test set that are capable of carrying out most of the testing required by the power industry in the country.
