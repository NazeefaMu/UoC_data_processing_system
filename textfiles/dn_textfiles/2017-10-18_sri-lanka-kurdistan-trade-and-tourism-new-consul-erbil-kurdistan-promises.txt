Sri Lanka-Kurdistan trade and tourism: New Consul to Erbil-Kurdistan promises improvements

“I will improve trade and tourism between Sri Lanka and the Kurdistan region of Iraq” said newly-appointed Sri Lankan Consul to the Erbil – Kurdistan Region of Iraq Dr. Ahamed Jalaldeen Mustafa at a press briefing held at the Cinnamon Grand Hotel, recently.
Dr. Ahamed Jalaldeen Mustafa, better known as Dr. Ahamed Jalal, is a reputed businessman in the Kurdistan region of Iraq with interests in manpower placement and tourism. Dr. Jalal obtained his PhD from Bharathi Vidyapita University in Pune, India, specializing in Legal Regulation, Governing International Law and Diplomatic Relations between India and Iraq. He was attached to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Iraq for a period of one and a half years and has travelled extensively in the Asian region.
“At present, there are about 4,000 Sri Lankans employed in the education, medical, hospitality and other sectors in the Kurdistan region of Iraq who will benefit once I establish the Consulate Office in Erbil within the next few weeks,” the new consul said.
“There are strong trade ties between Sri Lanka and Kurdistan and at present, almost 75 percent of the tea imported to Kurdistan is from Sri Lanka. After receiving my credentials, I have met the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Agriculture, Health and Higher Studies and discussed ways in which agriculture, trade, health and Sri Lanka’s Institutions of Higher Studies could be promoted in Kurdistan. Although there are many reputed Universities in the Kurdistan region of Iraq, many students seek admission to foreign Universities to further their higher studies. Even I completed my higher education in Pune, India and it is possible to promote Sri Lanka’s Universities and other institutions of higher learning,” he added.
Describing his country, the consul said, “The Kurdistan region of Iraq has a land area of 78,736 square kilometers and a population of approximately 5.3 million. The GDP is US$ 23.6 billion, while the per capita income is US$ 7,700. The region is rich in petroleum
resources, coal, copper, gold, iron, limestone, marble and zinc.”
Speaking about the impending independence of Kurdistan the consul said “On September 25, the people of the Kurdistan region of Iraq voted in favour for independence and further discussions in this regard are taking place. We look forward to a peaceful settlement in this regard.”
