Making money matters fun for children

Zerodha, India’s leading technology-driven brokerage firm recently announced the launch of the Sinhala version of its successful book for children The Rupee Tales.
Zerodha last year took a momentous step to nurture young minds with the Rupee Tales: a set of five story books which attempts to familiarise children above seven years to basic financial concepts. Zerodha has used storytelling with vibrant illustrations as a medium to convey these concepts.
Founder and CEO, Zerodha, Nithin Kamath,said “Zerodha is taking the forefront in improving financial literacy in India and we are taking this commitment further with the launch of the local version of our book the Rupee Tales. It is our earnest attempt to creatively inculcate basic financial awareness among children. The concepts covered in the Rupee Tales pertain to financial inclusion and a large part of the ‘financial inclusion for all’ dream is dependent on how the younger generation adapts to it.”
For the Sinhala version of the book, Zerodha has associated with Darshana publications who has the official translation and distribution rights of the book. Each book deals with a specific topic, peppered with lively characters, and vibrant illustrations. The concepts covered include; Savings,Banking and Inflation, Taxes, Insurance, and Stock Markets.
Author of The Rupee Tales Karthik Rangappasaid, “The idea to write Rupee Tales came to me when my 7-year-old daughter kept asking me where I work and what I do. I realized it was not easy to explain what the stock market is, or, for that matter, basics of finance. During a casual chat at work, we realized there was no material available to familiarize kids with basic financial concepts in India or for that matter across SE Asia. Being India’s leading financial services firm, we felt it was our responsibility to change this, and thus, The Rupee Tales was born.”
The books will be officially available for sale during Kandy Book Fair which is scheduled to take place from June 27 to July 1. It will also be available during the upcoming Colombo Book Fair to be held in September 2018.
“Knowledge at a critical age to change perception and for the formation of habits are even more critical. These simple yet powerful books from Zerodha introduce some very important principles to young children. Saving should be a habit. A habit which has to be cultivated from a very young age. One book in this series tackles savings and the need for saving in a simple yet powerful manner. These deeply rooted habits will continue in the lives of these children even when they grow up to be adults. Likewise, all five books convey stories which are important to forming good habits in our lives”, said Darshana Ralapanawe, Darshana publications.
