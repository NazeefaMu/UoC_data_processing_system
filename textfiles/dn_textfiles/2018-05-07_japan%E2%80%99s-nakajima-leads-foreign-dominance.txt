T-Cup Cycle Tour 2018
Japan’s Nakajima leads foreign dominance

Third and final stage of the Sri Lanka T-Cup Cycle Tour 2018 ended on a grand scale at Negombo with Japan’s Kinan Cycling Team member Yasuharu Nakajima winning the overall championship. The two runners up behind him were Kazakhstan’s Vino-Astana Motors cyclist Stepan Astafayev and Japan’s Ukyo team member Yoshimitsu Hiratsuka.
Yesterday’s the final leg of the tour began on schedule at 9.05 a.m. from Kandy and the first bunch of nearly 25 riders finished the race opposite the Negombo Municipal Council clocking 2hrs 44.36 secs. Though all riders were in a bunch to receive the flag it was Mohamed Hanif Saleh of Malaysia who crossed the line first and declared the winner. Though Saleh was able to win this stage he was not able to finish among the top ten in the previous two stages which was a real surprise.
The two riders who did well in the previous stages Stepan Astafyev and Yoshimitsu Hiratsuka finished runners up in yesterday’s event. When the cyclist started off from Kandy they were all in a bunch for nearly 30 kilometers before they broke off from the bunch and got in front by another 20 kilometers. The riders who were following the leaders never gave up the chase and battled well not to allow the leaders to increase their lead. The second bunch of cyclists were only a minute and 30 seconds away from the front runners. They held on to this distance for more than 40 kilometers
Cyclists reaching Pannala on the Kurunegala stretch saw the next break away when a few more riders fell behind. This gave more opportunity for the second bunch of riders to pedal faster and help catch up with the front line riders. On catching up with the leaders they rode extremely well to maintain a high speed. All were together until the finish line to receive the chequered flag from the Mayor of Negombo Municipal Council Dayan Lansa.
Two foreign riders crashed while attempting to go ahead just 50 meters away from the finish line. One rider had to be rushed to hospital as he had suffered severe injury to his hand.
The only Sri Lankan rider to excel in the final leg was Ramesh Viran Appuhamy who was placed 25th in Negombo. Ramesh was representing the Sri Lanka National Cycling team at the Sri Lanka T-Cup Cycle Tour 2018. Except for Ramesh none of the other nine Lankan riders were able to improve on their timings in all three stages. Sri Lanka’s two teams each comprising five riders represented the national team and president’s team. In the last leg the best three Lankans were Ramesh Viran, Hemantha Janaka Kumara and Madushanka Prabath Silva.
Nicholas White of Australia who displayed great skill in mountaineering was awarded the Mountain Prime Award, while the Best Overall Sprinter’s award went to Kazakhstan’s Stepan Astafyev who represented Vino Astana Motors Club. Frenchman Julian Amadori who represented the France Defence team received the Best Climber’s Award and the red dot jersey.
According to the points gained from the third stage yesterday Kinan Cycling team was in front but could not get the overall team Championship as Kazakhstan Astana team had the better timing from the three stags and carried away the team title.
