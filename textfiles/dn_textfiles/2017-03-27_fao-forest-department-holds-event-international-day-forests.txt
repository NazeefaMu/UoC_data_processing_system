FAO, Forest Department holds event for International Day of Forests

 The International Day of Forests (IDF) is celebrated globally on 21st March each year as a platform to raise awareness of the importance of all types of forests and of trees outside forests for the benefit of current and future generations.
This year’s global IDF theme concentrates on Forests and Energy. In Sri Lanka, FAO joined hands with the Sri Lanka UN-REDD Program and the Forest Department and Climate Change Secretariat, as well as SLYCAN Trust, to launch a one-minute video competition for the general public under the theme: Value of Forests.
The prize giving of the competition was held at the national celebration held to celebrate the International Day of Forests on 21st March at the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment in Battaramulla.
The event was attended by a host of dignitaries that included FAO Representative in Sri Lanka and many other dignitaries. The event provided a platform to raise awareness on the importance of all types of forests, and highlighted the role played by forests in providing livelihoods, powering sustainable development and mitigating climate change.

Speaking at the function, FAO Representative in Sri Lanka Ms Nina Brandstrup stated that ending deforestation is one of the quickest and most cost-effective ways to curb global warming.
“We all need to recommit to reduce deforestation and forest degradation in Sri Lanka, while finding ways to manage forests in a sustainable manner and conserve Sri Lanka’s forests while seeking new partnerships to increase the islands forest cover. This is exactly what the proposed national REDD+ strategy aims to achieve in a collaborative manner with all the major stakeholders of forests in Sri Lanka,” she added
Endorsing these comments, the Key Note Speaker of the occasion, Dr Suren Batagoda, Secretary, Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy, outlined factors on the significance of renewable energy in the future and pointed out that Sri Lanka has great potential to generate renewable energy. He explained that “greater investment in sustainable managed forests is the key to increasing forests’ role as a major source of renewable energy”.
Alexis Corblin, Chief Technical advisor, Sri Lanka UN-REDD Programme provided an insight into the approach taken by the proposed national REDD+ strategy, whilst the leader of the indigenous peoples’ community, Uruwarige Wannila Eththo, delivered some thought-provoking facts on the value of forests. .
