Aviation fuel pipeline from Muthurajawela  to Katunayake

Laying of the Jet A-01 Aviation fuel delivery pipeline from Muthurajawela to Katunayake Bandaranaike International Airport will be expedited during the next few months, Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said.
Addressing a progress review meeting held at the Ministry auditorium yesterday, Minister Ranatunga said, earlier plan was to lay the pipeline along the Hamilton Canal through Nugape-Bopitiya up to Pamunugama and from there to Katunayake parallel to the Colombo Katunayake Expressway. Since this was an arduous task as the plan was to cut across roadways, the RDA has agreed to lay it parallel to the Expressway due to the successful completion of the feasibility studies. The general international practice was to ensure a service corridor when building Expressways. Although Expressways had been built earlier without due thought to that practice, they had the possibility and room to build such a corridor, Minister Ranatunga added.
Meanwhile, a Ministry release said the country’s main aviation fuel supply dump is situated at the Katunayake Airport. At present, Aviation fuel is transported by train from the Kolonnawa Petroleum installation to Katunayake. At times bowsers are also deployed for this job. But according to present calculations, operations from Kolonnawa alone would not be able to meet the daily requirements. The present daily demand of 1.6 million litres is expected to increase to 2 million litres in 2020 and to 3.5 million litres in 2030.
As such, it is hoped to transport fuel from the Muthurajawela installation too to Katunayake in future. The pipeline from Muthurajawela to Katunayake would facilitate this. According to the earlier plan the pipeline length would have been 23.3 kilometers.
The length of the pipeline would be reduced by 3.5 km under the latest decision to lay it parallel to the Expressway. The number of bends too had been greatly reduced. As such, more than 200,000 kw hours of electricity could be saved annually in pumping fuel.
At present the Katunayake Aviation fuel terminal had received the ‘good’ grading according to the Joint Inspection Group Grading. The grading may be upgraded to ‘Excellent’ once the new project was completed.
Ranatunga said, due to the cost reduction in transport, Sri Lanka would gain the opportunity to supply aviation fuel at competitive prices in the region.
Ranatunga said, it was public money that was being used for projects of this nature and they were duty bound to use that money profitably without unnecessary wastage.
