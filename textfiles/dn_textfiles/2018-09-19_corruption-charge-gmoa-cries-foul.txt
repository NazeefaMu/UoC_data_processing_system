Corruption charge: GMOA cries foul

Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) Treasurer Dr. Nath Wijesuriya was summoned to the Bribery Commission yesterday to record a statement over an investigation launched into alleged foreign funds received by the GMOA.
GMOA Secretary Dr Haritha Aluthge and other GMOA members too met the Bribery Commission officials yesterday and handed over a letter stating that the complaint filed against them was false.
Speaking to the Daily News, Dr. Aluthge said this was a conspiracy led by several ministers to clamp down on the GMOA and spread false allegations.
“This was clearly an initiative led by several ministers to suppress the GMOA in order to cover up their corruption,” he said.
He said that the complainant was not disclosed, adding that GMOA would request the Commission to present the original complaint.
