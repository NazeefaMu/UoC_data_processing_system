Dual citizenship holders invited to participate in development

Dual citizenship holders have now received an opportunity to contribute towards Sri Lanka's economic development effort, said Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development and Cultural Affairs Minister S.B. Nawinna.
He said this at a ceremony held at the Isurupaya, Battaramula to mark the handing over of dial citizenship cards to a group of 750 people yesterday.
Nawinna said Sri Lankans who migrated to foreign countries have now gained an opportunity and the environment to return home and join the country's development effort ever since the 'Yahapalanaya' government assumed office.
President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had issued directives to offer dual citizenship to Sri Lankans wishing to return here and there were many Sri Lankans abroad who had expressed desire to come back and be of service to the motherland. So far dual citizenship cards had been presented to 23,000 persons. Controller of Immigration and Emigration Nihal Ranasinghe also spoke.
