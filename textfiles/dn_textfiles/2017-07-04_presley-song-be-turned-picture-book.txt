Presley song to be turned into picture book

One of Elvis Presley's biggest hits is the latest song to be turned into a picture book, and part of an effort to introduce the King to a new generation.
Dial Books for Young Readers said that a book based on "Love Me Tender" is coming out Nov. 13. "Elvis Presley's Love Me Tender" will be illustrated by Stephanie Graegin and include an endnote by Presley's widow, Priscilla Presley.
Dial Books is calling the new release "a heartwarming ode" to the parent-child bond. Presley died 40 years ago this summer, and representatives for his estate are planning a merchandise program for infants and toddlers.
Other songs inspiring children's books in recent years include "This Land is Your Land," ''Imagine" and "Blowin' in the Wind.”
