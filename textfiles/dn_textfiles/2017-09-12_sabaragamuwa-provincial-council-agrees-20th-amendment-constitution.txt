Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council agrees to 20th Amendment to the Constitution

 
The 20th Amendment to the Constitution was passed at the Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council (SPC) a short while ago.
Twenty-nine members voted in favour and eight voted against the decision.
The 20th Amendment suggests to hold all Provincial Council Election polls on the same day.
