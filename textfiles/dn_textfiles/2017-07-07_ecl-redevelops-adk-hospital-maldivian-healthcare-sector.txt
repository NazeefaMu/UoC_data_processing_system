The company’s health sector project in Bangladesh consisting of new hospital buildings, renovation and refurbishment of existing buildings and its eight-storey building for the Epilepsy Unit atColombo’s National Hospital showcase successfully completed high quality, patient centered projects. When ADK Hospital in Male, the archipelago’s first private hospital envisioned upgrading its facilities to provide services on par with international standards and meet future demand, it secured expertise and a development loan from Germany’s KfW Development Bank.
ECL’s successful track record in health sector projects and delivering quality services on time ensured it receivedKfW Development Bank’s endorsement as the ‘consultant of choice’.
ECL was tasked with creating a Master Plan for the redevelopment of the hospital ensuring it was linked with the other facilities through cohesive architecture.

The ECL proposed Masterplan encompasses three building complexes covering the entire hospital premises, with each redeveloped building integrated as a component of the overall plan, supporting the requisite technical services.
All allied services including the OT lighting and air conditioning systems, water supply and drainage facilities, and requisite supplies such as medical gases, oxygen supply, anesthetic gases and interconnected scavenger systems necessary to perform surgeries were all part of the structural installation undertaken by ECL.
With a promise to improve patient care, comfort and efficiency immersed with state-of-the-art technology, ECL will also develop a well-connected master plan for future implementation including all the centralized building services.
ECL’s dedication and ability to cater to the client’s specific needs will enable ADK’s long-term strategy of setting a new benchmark in healthcare services.
