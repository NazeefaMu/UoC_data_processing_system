Grama Shakthi:
Poverty alleviation in a new light

Poverty alleviation has occupied a prime slot in the universal agenda over the decades for the mere fact that it is a phenomenon that inhibits the progression of nations across the globe. Hence, emphasising the gravity of the issue, countries have arrived at a consensus to combat poverty by prioritizing ‘No Poverty’ as the first sustainable development goal (SDG) of the United Nations development agenda.
As a demographically and geographically small nation, Sri Lanka continues to feel the tremors of the poverty earthquake, though the effects could be lesser in extent compared to other countries in Asia and other regions.
In post-independent Sri Lanka, many governments that came into power launched many robust socioeconomic programmes to overcome poverty over the past 60 years. As a result, the poverty index which was 26.1 percent at national level in 1990/91 dropped to 6.7 percent in 2011/12. It is on an overall downward trend of 74 percent though there were subtle variations in the poverty index at 1.9 percent in urban areas and 4.5 percent in rural areas and 8.8 percent in estate areas. Poverty has donned varied forms at divisional, district and provincial level, making it a more complex, yet an urgent issue to be addressed.
Grama Shakthi’s objectives
President Maithripala Sirisena’s ambitious campaign to eradicate all forms of poverty by 2030 came to the fore against this backdrop under the banner ‘Grama Shakthi - People’s Movement’ on October 20, 2017. It is a fact that there were positive as well as negative aspects of many post-war poverty alleviation programmes that came into effect. The ultimate aim of Grama Shakthi is to alleviate poverty in the next 12 years (2018–2030) by reviewing and improving only the positive profile of these programmes and infusing strength to implement rural development plans with proper understanding of market opportunities, with the contribution of women and youth.
Four policies have been identified for the Grama Shakthi People’s Movement. They are identifying the nature of poverty by targetting families and areas, deriving public sector contribution for poverty alleviation, garnering support of the private sector for the cause, and mobilising the support of people and organisations to combat the reasons causing poverty.
Based on the above policies, the Grama Shakthi People’s Movement propagates certain golden rules that the community should follow to maximise the benefits. Breaching of any of these golden rules can inhibit the progress of the villages. These rule highlight the need to contribute to people’s development, uphold self-confidence and practice self-help, emphasise significance of being accountable for own actions, acknowledge that good governance is key to success, believe in gradual progression, the worth of cost effectiveness, the importance of transparency in transactions, uphold the principles of equity and inclusion, highlight the value of swift action and ensure quality and relying on others when required.
It is proposed to launch this village-based people’s movement covering all 14,022 Grama Niladari Divisions at Divisional Secretariat level. A people’s company (Grama Shakthi Unit) is formed with a Board of Directors representing 80 percent of families in selected 700 Grama Niladari Divisions that rose from 10 percent to 45 percent in the poverty index in 2017. Every villager can become a member and under this programme, a fund will be raised by the government to provide Rs. 8,000 per individual, an amount determined based on the size of the membership of each unit. Solutions will be provided through the Grama Shakthi Unit for identified poverty-related reasons within the village.
The President intends to adopt the self-sufficiency approach to meet the country’s food requirement and encourage frugality through this endeavour. The current food import cost is Rs. 400 billion per year. The project would aim at cutting down this cost by producing food within the country. Ensuring food prosperity in the country, saving foreign exchange, reducing the cost of living of the people, and upgrading living status, and strengthening the economy of the poor and the export economy are the expected outcomes of this food production drive.
Many programmes have been launched to uplift small and medium enterprise development by the government in line with the Grama Shakthi People’s Movement. According to the Central Bank Annual Report 2017, a new loan scheme ‘Swashakthi – Towards One Million Jobs’ launched on February 8, 2017, by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), extending the period of operations of National Agribusiness Development Programme (NADeP) up to December 31, 2017, increasing the loan size from Rs. 150,000 to Rs. 1 million and extending the loan repayment period from 36 months to 48 months of ‘Thurunu Diriya’ loan scheme has been proposed.
Launching of the ‘Athwela’ loan scheme by the CBSL to offer credit facilities on concessionary terms and conditions to resume economic activities affected by disasters in August last year was another milestone under this project. This initiative can be viewed as a progressive step to empower the rural masses who are constantly intimidated by individuals and private financial institutions when obtaining loan facilities. These small and medium enterprise development programmes directly contribute towards rural development and aligns with the Grama Shakthi People’s Movement’s mandate which is to alleviate rural poverty in gradual progression. Youth will be equipped with the latest information technology knowledge with the help of a leading private telecommunication service provider.
The agriculture sector
The agriculture sector is also at the receiving end of this movement. Considering the close association existing between poverty alleviation and agricultural development as poverty pervades mostly rural communities whose main source of income is agriculture, the initiative has a major thrust on agriculture development. The government has launched programmes to redesign policies, grant tax concessions on machinery and fertiliser, rehabilitate tanks, provide new technology and modernise agricultural research and provide training to encourage increased youth participation in agriculture.
The President has advised cultivation of paddy even in the off-seasons in protective houses using new technology, facilitating farmers with high prices and introducing various crops suitable for different climatic zones. Under the Grama Shakthi programme, cultivation of paddy in 800,000ha in the Maha season in 2017/2018 and cultivation of 500,000ha in the Yala season was planned. Under the programme ‘Atukotu Purawamu’, measures have been taken to cultivate 130,000ha of fallow paddy fields out of which 108,000 ha will be reserved for paddy farming and the remaining land is allocated for short-term cultivation with concessions being granted by the Agrarian Development Department.
Agriculture is not confined to rice and does not exist in isolation. According to Dr. Arumugam Kandiah, Independent Consultant to the World Bank, UNDP and Global Environment Facility (GEF) and former Senior Lecturer in Agriculture at the University of Peradeniya, rural development and agricultural development go hand in hand. Though paddy is a vital crop in terms of food security, it is not regarded as a cash crop. Therefore, the time has come to move beyond rice and take up cash crops such as fruits and vegetables which generate a higher income that in turn would raise the income of poor farming households.
Cash crops
Currently, maize is a good cash crop but is merely used as an animal feed. But, there is an excess of 200,000mt of maize per year. Hence, the government has taken steps to woo small and medium scale entrepreneurs towards taking up maize cultivation. Though soy bean is an ingredient used for animal feed in Sri Lanka, production amount per year is 10,000mt. It is only five percent of the local need. The rest is imported.
To limit importation, the government has decided to offer a handsome price and relax tax policies. Most of the green chilli requirement is imported today as the monthly consumption is 5,000mt, while the annual local production remains as low as 10,000mt. The imported green chilli is of inferior quality and far from being fit for human consumption. Hence, the government under Grama Shakthi has drawn up plans to cultivate green chilli in protected houses using sophisticated water supply methods and encourage youth to take up chilli cultivation. Even the private sector has come forward to facilitate onion farmers with proper storage facilities.
A ray of hope is clearly visible as the private banks, local and foreign market, local investors and business sector are ready to join hands with the Grama Shakthi People’s Movement. Foreign direct investment is directed to village-level agricultural products such as green gram, cowpea, black gram, groundnut, sesame and millet under the Grama Shakthi People’s Movement. A group of Swedish and Indian investors has expressed willingness to provide assistance in establishing and promoting a manioc flour plant targetting the Polonnaruwa, Trincomalee, Batticaloa and Moneragala districts and it is expected to cultivate manioc in 6,000 hectares.
Fruit and coconut cultivation
Though fruit production in the country is at a satisfactory level, fruit importation has raised serious concerns. It has revealed that most of the fruits imported at exorbitant prices fall well below the standards and often are not fit for human consumption. In this context, since local production of banana, papaya and pineapple is at a commendable level, off-season fruit production has prospects to become a profitable venture. Therefore, the Agriculture Ministry and Primary Industries Ministry have extended special assistance to boost fruit cultivation in rural areas.
Similarly, another controversial sector that has emerged in recent times is the coconut industry. People are strangled by high market price of coconut, a problem that has arisen partly due to dwindling coconut cultivating lands. As a solution, the Plantation Industries Ministry and the Coconut Development Board have taken steps to expand coconut cultivation, moving beyond the conventional Coconut Triangle to the dry zone. Further, the government has decided to facilitate coconut farmers registered at Agrarian Development Centres by providing concessions.
Aquaculture and fisheries
Even the water-related industries are in-focus in this development drive. The government pays constant attention to the aquaculture and fisheries industry by providing affordable financial facilities for purchase fishing gear, introducing new technologies, implementing policies for the development of infrastructure in the relevant field, breeding five million freshwater shrimp and fish breeds under the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Department, establishing aquaculture units in selected areas and setting up fish markets.
Dairy production is another major sector that the government is investing in to augment export earnings and increase potential for more employment opportunities. A programme is being implemented to provide a litre of milk daily for every house in the island by encouraging young entrepreneurs to have a farm with a production of 100 litres per day. Using uncultivated lands for animal feed production and developing organic fertiliser as a secondary production are also priorities.
In addition to the above facilitations, the government provided various incentives in the National Budget 2018 to promote the Blue–Green economy programme. The budget incentives further proposed tax concessions for implementing greenhouse technology that enables advanced technology in agriculture practices, de-silting small and medium tanks in a systematic manner for rainwater harvesting, new weather-based insurance cover for farmers, and a cost-sharing scheme for the fisheries sector.
Plans are also afoot to improve research and development in the plantation industry while providing a boost to export crops such as cinnamon and pepper by increasing production and promoting value addition.
Despite all those efforts to rejuvenate the rural masses by increasing their income level, the positive outcomes of the project are yet to be reviewed. Sri Lanka has witnessed the rise and fall of numerous state-driven poverty alleviation initiatives in the past that were of little avail in overcoming even basic livelihood problems of the rural community. There were many reasons for the failure of earlier poverty alleviation programmes. As opposed to the popular belief that the public sector is the sole authority responsible for eradicating poverty, the time is ripe to change that laidback stance and take agency to achieve individual and national development. For that, all stakeholders including the civil community and the private sector need to engage in this task. Most poverty alleviation initiatives were hindered by lack of political patronage, misallocation of resources, misappropriation of funds, lack of land and capital, poor communication between government officers and the community, and improper training given to officers.
These evils are always the pitfalls of any development drive that need to be tamed before they strike.
In the wake of new challenges in this era, poverty remains an unresolved issue despite many efforts being directed to eradicate it. Many scholars express the hope that Grama Shakthi would be a success like other global development initiatives such as the celebrated Comilla Programme of Rural Development and Youth Self-Employment Programme, both in Bangladesh.
In a similar vein, since it adopts a holistic approach in combatting poverty, Grama Shakthi appears to have muscle to become a promising intervention to end poverty in future Sri Lanka provided that previous mistakes are duly addressed and ruled out.
