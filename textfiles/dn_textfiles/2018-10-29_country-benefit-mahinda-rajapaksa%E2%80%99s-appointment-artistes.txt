Country to benefit from Mahinda Rajapaksa’s appointment - Artistes

Free Artistes’ Movement President Sudath Rohana said the appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister is received as a blessing not only by the public, but also by many foreign countries. The public rejoices over Prime Minister Rajapaksa’s appointment at a time when the country, its culture, political system and the economy has collapsed.
Rohana also said President Maithripala Sirisena’s decision to appoint Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister is the correct one.
He was speaking at a press briefing held at the Abhayarama Temple, Narahenpita, yesterday. Members of the Free Artistes’ Movement including Gamini Jayalath and Upali Samarasinghe participated in the press briefing.
“We can say that the people’s movement launched in 2018 has finally become successful. The country’s culture, political system, and economy had collapsed. Art and culture had deteriorated. The appointment of Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa is a fulfillment of the people’s wish. Many foreign countries also accept this development,” Rohana said.
“We are thankful to President Maithripala Sirisena for taking this accurate decision.
He fulfilled the people’s wish using the powers vested in him. Ranil Wickremesinghe did not follow the precedent of Prime Minister D.M. Jayaratne or President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Hence, the country was extremely disappointed. So we urge him to leave Temple Trees and hand over the Premiership to Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa,” he said.
Advisor to the Free Artistes’ Movement, Rohana Beddage said that artistes had won back the freedom they deserve with this change.
“We are free artistes. We need government support as artistes. Then, we can act without party politics. This was not the case in the last few years. Artistes were not treated correctly. We couldn’t work with satisfaction. We are glad that we won back our freedom,” Beddage said.
“The strongest power in this world is the power of the people. As artistes we would like to say, ‘You are the Prime Minister, we are made from dust’. We would like to request our new Prime Minister to end the era of Rupavahini, ITN and Lake House where trumpeting of the former Wickremesinghe government took place, and allow fair coverage for all parties,” he said.
Executive member of Free Artistes Movement Geetha Kumarasinghe said the appointment of the new Prime Minister is the beginning of a golden age.
“People were in fear of what is going to happen to the country following the economic crisis. People came to Colombo and requested a new government. Now they are rescued from the adverse situation they were in. I am thankful to President Maithripala Sirisena for this decision and would like to wish Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa all the very best.”
Douglas Siriwardena, Sunanda Mahendra, Rohana Dev Perera, Gamini Adhikari, Melani Ashoka, Priyanath Rathnayake, Saman Ekanayake and Dharmananda Wijesekara too participated in the press briefing.
