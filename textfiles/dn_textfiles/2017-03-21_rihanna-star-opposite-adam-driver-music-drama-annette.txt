Rihanna to star opposite Adam Driver in music drama Annette

Rihanna has landed yet another movie project - starring opposite Adam Driver in music drama Annette.
The 29-year-old singer is expanding her film resume with a series of impressive movie roles, including the upcoming Ocean’s Eight opposite Cate Blanchett, Anne Hathaway and Helena Bonham Carter.
Adam Driver is also busy making his cinematic mark, after rising to fame on Lena Dunham’s TV drama Girls before being cast as Kylo Ren in Star Wars: The Force Awakens.
Now Rihanna and Adam are joining forces for Annette - the first English-language movie from legendary French director Leos Carax.
Further details of the pair’s roles in the film have yet to be revealed but Variety reports that while Rihanna’s involvement had been rumoured in the project, it has now been confirmed.
Rooney Mara was another name linked to the film but has pulled out due to clashing commitments. Bosses are now said to be looking for a new actress to take on the other female lead role.
The script for Annette has been written by Sparks, the rock band founded by Ron and Russell Mael in 1971, with the group also penning original songs for the movie. Shooting on the film will begin this spring in a variety of locations, including Los Angeles. Rihanna has since lent her voice to animated movie Home as well as starring in hit TV show Bates Motel.
