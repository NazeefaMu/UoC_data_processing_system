New laws to destroy seized drugs needed - Minister

Formulation of new regulations relating to the destruction of drugs seized by law enforcement authorities is needed, Law and Order Minister Ranjith Maddumabandara said.
Addressing a meeting after opening the child-friendly unit building put up by the Rotary Club of Colombo Metropolitan at the Ragama police station he said the police was playing a great role in combatting the narcotic drugs racket than ever before.
“As the President and the Prime Minister were both keen on saving the country from narcotics which had become a social menace he as minister in charge had been given the full freedom and leverage to tackle this problem,”he said.
“Increased raids and seizures have been misinterpreted by detractors to show that the drug menace had increased under the tenure of the present government. But the truth was that raids had increased by leaps and bounds under the present regime. This was in sharp contrast to the situation under the former regime where drug racketeers arrested by police had to be let free on the orders of powers that be,” Maddumabandara said.
