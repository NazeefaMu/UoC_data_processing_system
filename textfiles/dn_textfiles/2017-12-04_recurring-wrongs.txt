Recurring wrongs

Over 14,000 children are institutionalized in Sri Lanka, and in the eyes of the justice system, this is the preferred way of dealing with orphans, victims of abuse, and alleged juvenile offenders alike.
Unlike in other countries, where judges often send young victims or perpetrators of crime to foster care or for alternative treatment, in Sri Lanka, the solution is often the same: institutionalization.
“There’s a lot of child abuse, a lot of neglect, a lot of ill-treatment, because government officials are not practical, they’re not open-minded,” said Marini de Livera, the Chairperson of the National Child Protection Authority.
This situation is a direct result of Sri Lanka’s laws.
A new report published by the UNICEF and Colombo-based Verite Research found that the current legal framework does not treat the institutionalization of children as a matter of “last resort.”
Instead, “Magistrates have demonstrated a dispensation towards institutionalizing children within the justice system,” the report states, rarely differentiating between alleged offenders and victims of crime.
The result is that children, many of whom are dealing with histories of violence and abuse, are often re-victimized by the justice system that’s supposed to protect them. They are put into homes that are ill-prepared to deal with them as they wait months, even years, for their cases to go through the Courts.
“This dispensation (by the Courts) risks removing the child from a family-oriented environment,” the report adds. “And subjecting him or her to further psychological trauma.”
Punished for being a victim
Mumtaz Faleel is the Country Manager of the Emerge Lanka Foundation, a nonprofit organization that provides education, counseling, and support services to young women living in children’s homes.
She said she sees the effects of this flaw in the justice system in her work every day.
Faleel tells the story of Shenali*, a young woman who went through Emerge’s programmes.
Shenali was raped as a teenager, and taken into state care as a protectionary measure. But the case against the man who sexually abused her dragged on, and she ended up spending much of her young life in the children’s home, away from her family.
Shenali’s situation is not unique: UNICEF found that it takes an average of six years between the investigation of a child’s case and the commencement of trial. According to one source at the Attorney General’s department, approximately 40 percent of their total pending criminal cases were cases of child abuse.
After Shenali turned 18, she had to leave the home, and a judge in her case released her to Emerge’s care.
The nonprofit organization runs a three-month reintegration programme that gives young women life skills training, mental health counseling, and English and IT courses, before setting them up with jobs and boarding when they graduate.
At the end of the programme, Shenali got a manufacturing job, rented a room at a boarding house with a few other Emerge graduates, and began living independently.
But then her case was called again, and she had to travel to the Court, only for it to be delayed once more.
Rather than release Shenali back to her new home and job, the judge ordered that she go back to her children’s home, to ensure that she would come back to testify the next time her case was called up.
“Now she’s there indefinitely,” said Faleel. Instead of earning money and building a new life, she spends her days sitting in an orphanage, waiting for her case to end.
“Institutionalization is doing more harm than good,” said Faleel.
“We got the wrong end of the stick, don’t you think? In every other country, it’s the perpetrator who’s locked up, or is in a list of some sort, or is subjected to stigma.”
“But here it’s completely the other way around,” she added. “We do all of that to the girl.”
Punishing children like adults
The situation is also bleak for young people accused of committing crimes.
There are only two specialized juvenile Courts in the country, meaning that children’s cases are often heard alongside adults’.
The UNICEF report found that “notwithstanding the obligations under (Sri Lankan law), Magistrates often did not explain the charges to children in conflict with the law in language appropriate to the child’s age and level of maturity.” For that reason, along with a lack of legal representation, the report stated that many children were led into taking unfavourable plea bargains.
If a young person is found guilty of a crime, the Children and Young Persons Ordinance is supposed to provide alternative sentencing options, recognizing that children have a higher likelihood of successfully reintegrating into society than adults, if they’re supported with counseling and education.
But Verite and UNICEF found that “this option failed to play a part in the criminal justice proceedings, to the detriment of children.”
“Moreover,” the report states, “since a large proportion of children in conflict with the law are first time offenders, petty offenders, or offenders as a result of an adult using a child for the purposes of a criminal activity, institutionalizing such children adversely affects their reintegration into society.”
By being locked up at a young age, “you have become vulnerable, through that same system that has failed to recognize your vulnerability,” said Sajeeva Samaranayake, a former National Child Protection Authority Deputy Director.
Samaranayake has a long history of being critical of the justice system in Sri Lanka, and was removed from his post this year for criticizing the way Sri Lanka handled cases of child abuse.
“Everybody is kind of passing the buck,” he said in a recent interview. “Police pass the buck to the Courts, the Courts to the institutions, then the poor caregivers in the institutions are overwhelmed.”
Potential reforms
The UNICEF report recommends reforms that they say would fix some of the justice system’s most glaring faults.
One is to pass the Children Judicial Protection Bill, which right now is just a draft in the Ministry of Justice. The bill would require the Court to consider the “best interests” of the child in each individual case, and would provide for the appointment of a judicial guardian to assist in legal proceedings. It would also prioritise foster care over institutionalization.
Other recommendations are to create a sex offender registry, allow children to be cross-examined through closed-circuit television rather than in open Court, and raise the minimum age of criminality from 8 to 12. Another key recommendation is to create a database to track and monitor children within the justice system, which would be monitored by the National Child Protection Authority.
NCPA Chairperson Marini de Livera, says she agrees with many contentions of the UNICEF report, and its recommendations. “We can’t hide behind a narrow approach,” she said. She said the NCPA recently received Board approval to start a pilot foster care programme with war widows in the North and East.
“Orphanages are a structure that was introduced by the British colonial masters,” she said. “The British themselves have abandoned it and we are still clinging to it.”
She also said the NCPA is in the final stages of developing a database of all the children in the justice system with the University of Colombo.
When Verite and the UNICEF launched the report earlier this month, Minister of Justice Thalatha Athukorala said she would be setting up a steering committee to advance the recommendations of the study.
“While Sri Lanka, particularly the Ministry of Justice, has already initiated action related to some areas which the report highlights, such as increasing the minimum age of criminal responsibility as well as amending the Children Judicial Protection Bill to include the principle of best interest of the child as the predominant consideration in all matters related to the child, there remain areas for improvement that need to be addressed with utmost urgency,” she said.
Until the laws are changed, situations like Shenali’s, where children are deprived of liberty whether they’ve committed a crime or not, will continue to be the status quo.
*Shenali’s name and some personal details have been changed to protect her identity.
