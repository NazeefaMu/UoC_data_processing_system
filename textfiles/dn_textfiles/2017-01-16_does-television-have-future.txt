Does television have a future?

Television has changed. With a dizzying array of entertainment choices on digital streaming platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu and HBO Go, consumers are facing countless hours of addictive, high-quality programming. Addiction is the key here, as a recent and much debated study by the University of Texas suggests. The researchers conducted a survey on 18–29 year olds on how often they binge-watched TV, and how often they had feelings of loneliness, depression and self-regulation deficiency. The findings showed addictive behaviour: those who lacked the ability to control themselves were more likely to binge-watch. It’s not the first time excessive TV watching has been linked to health problems. Scientific studies have shown that prolonged television viewing is linked to the increase of obesity, diabetes, social isolation and a suffering sex life. And with the newest trend of “speed watching” (streaming content at accelerated speed, sometimes two times as fast as normal) to cope with the huge amount of serialized content, we need to ask ourselves: which form of television do we actually want? Why is this kind of entertainment so powerful? And is this the end of “old television” as we know it?
Digital ecosystems
The answer lies in the power and logics of digital ecosystems. Companies such as Netflix and Amazon have created powerful networks, which connect digital businesses, digital consumers and digital devices, and are ultimately changing the way we work and live.
These ecosystems know who we are, what we like, what we buy, and what our friends think about it. And we are happy to provide them with all the data they need by posting, buying, rating, consuming and commenting online.
Platforms such as Netflix and Amazon are designed to be immersive and to create profiles of their users based on their tastes, trends and social fragmentation. They operate by the logics of mass media. There is an argument that media in the twentieth century gained power by creating the discourse that guides the organization of the public sphere. Television as a mass medium is operating in a complex set of interacting structures, as actors in different social functional systems define it and adapt to it at the same time. What we interpret as “television” is therefore changing all the time. Currently the linguistic and visual vocabulary of television is influenced by the transition to media convergence: we’re streaming, downloading and watching content online – and we still call it television.
Carefully planned
At the same time, Netflix’s premium content is actually very limited, but carefully planned and researched to maximize its appeal to a targeted section of the audience, exemplified in the recent relaunch of Gilmore Girls (a popular and missed TV show, with a strong fanbase) and the science fiction show Stranger Things (which exploits nostalgia for the 1980s among today’s 30–40 year olds, who grew up with films such as E.T., The Goonies and Stand by me). All of those are based on data and preferences provided by its users through ratings, searches and algorithms. The phrase “You might also like . . . ” at the end of an episode is more than just a recommendation; it’s a way to collect data from the audience.
In other words: Netflix knows what their users want – and what they will want – long before they’ll actually produce it. Amazon even offers its customers pilot episodes for every planned show, greenlighting whatever pilots get the best ratings.
These are clever modes of audience research, and we don’t even notice them. At the same time, streaming platforms feed our desire for more. Netflix gives you exactly twenty seconds between episodes to decide, if you’d rather do anything else. If you refuse to make a decision, the platform will do it for you: it not only plays the next episode after twenty seconds, it also skips the intro to resume the narrative world without further interruption. You might not even realize that you’re watching a new episode.
Recently there has been much talk about the “filter bubble” in relation to fake news on Facebook, whereby we receive news only from feeds that reinforce pre-existing beliefs. The same filter bubbles that may pose dangers for pluralistic thinking on social media also exist in relation to television streaming platforms. Given that both Facebook and Netflix wield great influence over the media that we consume, helping to shape our world views and basic assumptions about culture, they ought also to offer content that, in a broad sense, benefits society; but of course in reality they can offer anything they like. Audiences need to be more proactive. By only watching personalized entertainment, audiences currently see only what they want. They no longer need to tune in at a specific time or even stumble across unexpected content, which might challenge them. This is the classic definition of a filter bubble. Unlike news filter bubbles, the risk is not that users will form false beliefs about politics and current affairs, but that their sense of the cultural landscape will become distorted.
This leads us to the role of “old television”. Digital streaming platforms won’t replace television. It’s still one of the most significant cultural industries in terms of time spent and revenue earned. According to a survey by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Americans spend about two hours and 49 minutes per day watching TV. However, digital platforms are supplementing older forms of television, as often happens when new media technologies are introduced and disseminated. The same happened with printed books and e-books; radio and podcasts; analogue recordings of music and streaming services such as Spotify. New media technologies have rarely completely replaced their predecessors.
Primary mission
Traditional television should remember its primary mission, and certainly should not try to compete with ecosystems primarily focused on entertainment content. European countries, in particular, have a long tradition of a mixed mandate system, in which state-supported public broadcasters compete with the commercial sector. You can find prime examples in Germany, France, Austria and especially in the UK with the BBC. Its purpose is to serve the public interest by promoting education and learning, stimulating creativity and sustaining civil society. And at the same time it competes with commercial offers such as ITV or Sky. The BBC provides the model of public broadcasting that offers the biggest opportunities for “old television” to reinvent itself by contributing to national and transnational identities, giving attention to minorities and refusing commercial objectives. ARTE, the public Franco-German TV network, provides another example. It’s clearly a channel with a European identity, promoting arts and culture programming. Its viewers are able to see high-quality documentaries, political debates and classic films. At the same time the network is able to experiment with new technologies such as Virtual Reality productions. Television has the chance to speak to and engage its audiences in a way that streaming platforms don’t. With the additional benefit of broadcasting live events such as sports and political debates, television can reflect our work-life balance and help to structure our daily lives.
The way we live has changed in the past ten years and terms such as “prime time” rarely suit the media consumption habits of a new generation. But structures, schedules and programming should be able to adapt to new consumption forms. This is the only chance television has to compete with the filter bubbles of digital entertainment.
