New hormone kit will enable men to breastfeed

While having a child is special for a lot of people, men can’t experience some aspects of parenthood due to certain limitations. But medical science has opened doors to a lot of possibilities over the past few years resulting in radical changes.
Now a new breakthrough promises to enable men to breastfeed and its inventor claims it will be available in five years. The hormone kit requires a man to take a cocktail of drugs in order to grow milk ducts by the time the child is born. While it hasn’t been tested the side effects may cause men to grow breasts up to a B-cup size. The product is seen as an empathy tool which can enable men to help and support their partners who struggle to breastfeed.
The process would require a man to take hormone progestin from the day his partner discovers she is pregnant. In the last six weeks the man is required to take domperidone four times a day to stimulate production of prolactin. Prolactin is a hormone that makes a woman’s body produce breast milk.
