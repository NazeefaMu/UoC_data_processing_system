Armand Flamer Caldera wins coveted title in Play-off

Sixteen-year-old Armand Flamer Caldera played brilliant golf on the final day to card a gross 73. He was 5 strokes behind leader Vinod going in to the last round and then he piled on the pressure being 1 under Par after 10 holes, quickly closing in on Vinod. Eventually Armand’s Par Round gross 73 to Vinod’s 5 over forced a sudden death play-Off in the Gold Division (15 -17 years).
It was an exciting play off, where both players were matching shot to shot but Armand proved his supremacy by winning the coveted title of ‘Prima Regional Junior Champion’ in the Gold Division. Over 70 juniors compete for top honors at the championship at the Victoria Golf and Country Resort, Kandy. Januka Dilshan who came with a good last round score,however had to settle for 2nd runner-up. T. Akash went on to take the 3rd runner-up trophy with a total score of 175.
In the Silver Division (age group category 12 – 14 years) playing 18 holes, experienced Taniya Minel Balasuriya enjoyed a comfortable win, playing consistent golf over the two days with an aggregate score of 167. Both P.A Dimuthu and Dhuvarshan were tied on 175 but Dimuthu went on to be 1st runner-up on the count back and Dhuvarshan ended as 2nd runner-up. Kayla Perera secured 3rd runner-up with an aggregate score of 180.
In the Bronze Division (age group category 10 – 11 years) playing 13 holes, we saw Sherin Mithara recorded a comfortable win with a total score of 119 over Nirekh Tejwani with a total score of 122 over two days of play. Followed by Yannik Kumara who improved on the second day but failed to close the leader gap and had to settle for 2nd runner-up with a total score of 128. The youngster K. Danushan with a total score of 133 became 3rd runner-up. We are likely to see the talent pool blossoming in this division with the maturity of the young golfers.
In the Copper Division (Age Group 09 & under) playing 9 holes Shanal Binuksha won by 7 shots with a score of 85 and took the most junior category win in style. Kvahn Tejwani was 1st runner-up with a total score of 92. For 2nd and 3rd runner-up place we saw a battle between Musa Shariff of UAE and Pranav Muralidaran. However Musa with total score of 102 got the better of Pranav who had 105.
