‘SriLankan Catering not registered as a public company’

SriLankan Catering Services had not been registered as a public company at the Department of Registrar of Companies. The registration had not been made due to certain discrepancies in filling the relevant application form issued to Mihin Lanka Airlines.
This was disclosed by Indika Roshan Deeptha Gunawardena, Assistant Manager (Companies), Department of the Registrar of Companies in his evidence before the Presidential Commission Investigating Alleged Fraud Corruption and Misappropriation of State Funds and Assets on July 5.
He was giving evidence under cross examination by State Counsel Fuzly Razeek. Gunawardena said the discrepancy related to the filling of the column in the Applications from relating to capital.
Shares had been indicated in the column specified for capital.
If SriLankan Catering Services was registered as a public company, a certificate would have been issued with the rubber seal of the Department of the Registrar of Companies.
But no such certificate had been issued to SriLankan Catering Services.
State Counsel Fuzly Razeek said as regards this matter he would request the Commission to pay attention to companies Act Number 7 of 2007 Section 51 Sub Section 5.
