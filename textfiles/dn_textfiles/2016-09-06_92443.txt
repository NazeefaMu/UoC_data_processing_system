Seven JO MPs set to join govt: Isura

Seven MPs of the Joint Opposition (JO) are ready to join the government following the tremendous success of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party’s 65th convention in Kurunegala, Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya said.
He made this revelation at a media briefing yesterday. “We celebrated the golden convention of the party on September 4 amid many challenges. While addressing the Party’s 65th convention, President Maithripala Sirisena stressed that the SLFP will contest the upcoming Local Government elections under the party’s traditional ‘Hand’ symbol while a number of leaders from 20 other parties were present at the stage,” Devapriya said.
“The President also invited other political parties supporting the SLFP and those who are willing to do so in the future to contest as a common front at future polls under the ‘Hand’ symbol. President Sirisena said a SLFP led government will be formed in 2020 much to the joy of its supporters. He was able to win the confidence of the public within one day, within one moment with this brave statement,” the Chief Minister said.
“Although 38 SLFP parliamentarians in the JO boycotted the convention, the 65th SLFP convention attracted a massive crowd, which according to many political experts, was the biggest, SLFP convention ever. This is the first time in my political career of 25 years, that I too witnessed such a massive crowd. Many supporters missed the opportunity to take part in the convention due to the heavy traffic congestion along Kurunegala road. This clearly proves that the public’s support is still with us,” he added.
Devapriya also said that they were able to witness the positive signs of the reorganisation of the party during the convention.
“All the JO members who alleged that the removal of 13 SLFP organisers was a plan implemented by the UNP to split the SLFP cannot remember that it is during the time of the former President that 17 organisers were removed and the organiser posts were given to UNP members who had just joined the government,” Western Provincial Council Minister Gamini Thilakasiri said.
“Therefore we invite all members to join with us and walk towards a new political journey without trying to tarnish the image of the party. They all should remember that we all are here in these positions, not due to our personal attractiveness, but due to the party and its name. Therefore they all should be grateful to the party,” Thilakasiri said. He said anybody has the right to voice their objections while being in the party, since they have a democratic leader.
“MP Kumara Welgama, and Minister W.D.J. Seneviratne are two good examples. They even represent the party’s CC. But they never register their criticisms by leaving the party. Only immature inexperienced politicians act against the party and they should be forgiven,” he added.
