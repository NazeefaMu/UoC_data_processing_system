[APPRECIATIONS - (26-03-2018)]

Sumana Perera
A dynamic nurse
Life is a splendid gift. There is nothing small about it. - Florence Nightingale
Our country lost an illustrious nightingale of our own who was greatly inspired by the above quote from the role model of her profession, when nursing professional Sumana Perera passed away recently.
Nursing always held a great appeal as a vocation for Sumana since her childhood. As a child, she had taken interest and pleasure in treating injured pets. So when she was selected to undergo training as a nurse at the age of 20 in 1963, it was more a fulfilment of a cherished ambition than an initial step into a lifelong career.
Sumana would often tell this writer who first came to know her as a fellow employee of the Health Department and later, as the wife of a close friend, “I came into nursing by choice, not by accident.”
Soon after graduating from the Post-Basic School, Sumana was promoted as a nursing sister and assigned to the National Hospital Accident Service Unit. Later, authorities appointment Sumana Sister-in-Charge of the Medical Intensive Care Unit which was opened by former late President J. R. Jayewardene. She was promoted to Matron soon afterwards.
She later won a scholarship to undergo training in specialised nursing care for trauma victims, in Finland. On her return to the island upon completing the training course, she was briefly the Gampaha General Hospital Matron. By this time, arrangements were being made to shift the Accident Service Unit of the National Hospital to a new building and Sumana was transferred back to the unit to take over as its matron.
Sumana was appointed the National Hospital Chief Nursing Officer in 1992. She assumed duties as a Director of Nursing at the Health Ministry in 2000 and continued to serve in this capacity until her retirement in 2002.
According to her colleagues, Sumana was inspired by the illustrious career and writings of Florence Nightingale and would often cite her quotes to inspire her peers and subordinates.
Following is one of the popular quotes from Florence Nightingale which she often cited:
If a patient is cold, if a patient is feverish, if a patient is faint, if he is sick after taking food, if he has a bed sore, it is generally the fault not of the disease, but of the nursing.
After her marriage to former Lake House Director D. K. Somasiri, Sumana, a human dynamo, found time to extend her active support to social service projects her husband was involved in, as an active member of the Ganemulla Lions Club.
She was a life-member of the Sri Lanka Nurses Association and held key posts within it from time to time. She also took a keen interest in the activity of the Graduate Nurses' Foundation from its inception. In fact, she was among the first batch of BSc Nursing graduates that passed out from the Open University of Sri Lanka (OUSL).
Sumana leaves her husband D. K. Somasiri and daughter Nadeesha Jayamaha.
I wish to conclude this appreciation with the famous quote:
Death leaves a heartache that no one can heal; love leaves a memory no one can steal.
May she attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana!

N. Pathmanathan
Pillar of strength
Namasivayam Pathmanathan was the first officer to gain entry into the Sri Lanka Administrative Service (SLAS) in the Batticaloa District, in 1967. He passed the open competitive examination conducted by the Examinations Commissioner General. He passed away on March 4, 2018.
Pathmanathan was a past pupil of Shivanadha Vidyalaya (Rama Kirishnan Mission), which has produced numerous SLAS Officers including I. Shivanadha, at that time, was the leading English Medium School in the District.
V. Thiyahalingam of Huskison Street, Trincomalee, was my classmate at Shivanadha Vidyalaya as well as at the School of Agriculture, Peradeniya, where we completed our Diploma Course in Agriculture. It is he who connected me to late Pathmanathan, who invited me to serve at the Trincomalee Provincial Council Office when he was the first Chief Secretary to the Provincial Council of the North and East. Then the Chief Minister was Varatharaja Perumal. Thiyahalingam currently now working in London.
Late N. Pathmanathan had held a number of executive posts, such as Government Agent, Deputy District Secretariat Treasury Secretary, Finance Ministry Budget Director and several other high-ranking positions.
Lastly, he was appointed the Rehabilitation of Persons, properties and industries Authority (REPPIA) Chairman by the Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Minister.
Having passed the G. C. E (O/L) and G. C. E. (A/L), he also served as a Teacher in English at St. Michael's College, Batticaloa, until he entered the University of Peradeniya.
He was a pillar of strength to all those who came met with. He was also the District Governor to rotary clubs in the Batticaloa District from 2002 – 2003. This loss leaves a void that could never be filled.
I convey my deepest condolences to the members of the bereaved family of late Namasivayam Pathmanathan. May his soul rest in peace.
A. L. Ibra Lebbe Retd. Divisional Secretary, SLAS
Sylvia Weerasinghe
Woman of unwavering faith
The weight of this sad time we must obey. Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say. The oldest hath borne most. We that are here shall never see so much nor live so long. - William Shakespeare
I feel a void left by your absence. I miss you dearly. You were more of a mother than a friend to Hillary and I. We were blessed to have you in our lives. I will remember all the times you prayed for us, those wake-up calls to check after a court hearing, because a squatter illegally occupied our home.
We remember all the special and vivid memories, images of our Sunday evenings at Calvary Church, when we looked forward to attending service and meeting you. We could never forget you visiting us in Oman, the happiness of having you in our home and of those meetings where the Expatriate Christian Community in that part of the world, were blessed to meet you and hear the word of God.
During that time, our spiritual life changed as well, while we watched you pray regularly at dawn. All this is in the prism of our memory. Those were the brightest images from the stream of time that we have of you, our beloved Aunty Sylvia. Your constant communication, reassuring care and concern, touched the core of many for sure. Our hearts will always hold safe the love and care you had for Hillary and I.
You always reminded us of faith, that no matter what, even if life turns cold at times, God’s love and tenderness will pull us through the roughest of waters. Your beloved children and family have inherited the same esteemed love you had for God, which accompanied you every step and in every path of your life. You lived in the light of your faith and your values.
Many would speak of you and share their thoughts of your remarkable and unshakable faith in God. How can we forget that smile of yours, which always meant so much to those who met youthat smile that will never be lost, beaming in the marvelous splendor of Heaven. We here on earth, will always love you and miss you so much.
Charmaine and Hillary Candappa
Marhooma Florine
Vibrant personality
Those we love go away
They walk beside us everyday
Years may pass and fade away
But memories of loved ones are here to stay
The Malay world was made to look the poorer by the untimely demise of one of its vibrant personalities who graced many an occasion with her witty and active participation.
Marhooma Florine was a hands-on individual who would do her utmost to alleviate the hardships faced by the underprivileged with her persuasive tactics and she would walk the extra mile to garner the necessary donations, whatever the cause may be, but never at a loss to meet her desired goals.
A product of Ladies' College, she never lost common touch as she was able to move with the highs and lows of society as she was a prominent participant in all activities in which she saw her stewardship prosper.
She was always at her best at any occasion; she would stir up proceedings at any get-together, break into song and dance, filling the occasion with rapture, with her sterling performances. How we miss her in her absence, will be felt by all the institutions to which she lent her patronage.
I would like to extend our heartfelt condolences to her dearly beloved husband, Laddie, who stood by her at all times and to her children and their extended families.
Death is not the greatest loss in life; the greatest loss is what dies inside us while we live.
