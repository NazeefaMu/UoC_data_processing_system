Kandy landslide victims receive aid

Nearly 100 families affected by landslides in Kandy, who had received alternative homes in Arakotawelgala in Weragoda, were recently provided with infrasture facilities, food items, books and school equipment.
The event was carried out under the auspices of Singapore Maha Karuna Buddhist Association Chairman Ven. Dr. Karadetiyana Gunaratana Thera and Los Angeles Lankaramadhipti Ven. Aluthnuwara Sumanatissa Nayaka Thera.
The ceremony also symbolised the long-standing mutual friendship and relations between Sri Lanka and Singapore. The event began with the opening of a fully-equipped community centre built in the village and the installation of a Buddhist statue.
The Maha Sangha and other invitees were conducted to the venue in a procession. After the meeting, a stock of dry food rations including rice, were distributed among the affected families. A concert was also staged by children of the village.
Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, former Ministers Athauda Seneviratne and Lalith Dissanayake, Kegalle Government Agent Chandrasiri Bandara and Maha Karuna Bauddha Sangamaya officials including its Secretary Khema, also graced the occasions.
