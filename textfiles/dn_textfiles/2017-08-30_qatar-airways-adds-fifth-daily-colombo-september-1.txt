Qatar Airways adds fifth daily to Colombo from September 1

Qatar Airways continues to demonstrate strong global growth with the announcement of new flights to Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.
The ‘Airline of the Year’ has responded to continued robust demand from passengers by increasing its Colombo service from four to five flights per day from September 1, just one month after the last frequency increase.
Its Dhaka service will increase from two to three flights per day, also effective from September 1.
The additional non-stop, daily services to and from Colombo and Dhaka will each be serviced by Qatar Airways modern A320s, adding more than 1,000 seats to the current weekly capacity to and from both exciting destinations.
Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive, Akbar Al Baker said: “We are again delighted to be able to cater to business and leisure growth in both of these vibrant gateway cities. When passengers travel with us on our non-stop service to Doha and onward to destinations in Europe, Americas and the Middle East, these additional frequencies will provide even greater flexibility, award-winning service and convenience that they can only experience with Qatar Airways.
“The increased capacity on the Dhaka and Colombo routes represents a major commitment by Qatar Airways to enhance our offering to Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. We have demonstrated our long-term commitment to both countries that has been rewarded with the loyalty of many thousands of passengers per month who choose to fly with us. We look forward to welcoming even more passengers on our flights.”
The Qatar Airways Airbus A320 features 12 Business Class seats and 132 seats in Economy Class. Besides a spacious environment throughout the entire aircraft, passengers across both cabins can enjoy complimentary inflight meals. Those with special dietary requirements need only contact Qatar Airways before their flight to make their selection from our wide range of special meal types, available upon request.
Business Class passengers can relax in their comfortable reclining beds and enjoy the on-demand à la carte menu service and luxurious Bric’s amenity kits. These, coupled with Qatar Airways cabin crew’s renowned Arabian hospitality, will ensure passengers arrive at their destination feeling refreshed and energised.
Leisure and business travellers can also take advantage of the exceptional value available to them through Qatar Airways Holidays, where there are value-priced hotels, destination-specific tours and holiday packages available to suit every taste, in both these beautiful countries.
Qatar Airways has received a number of accolades this year, including Airline of the Year by the prestigious 2017 Skytrax World Airline Awards, held at the Paris Air Show. This is the fourth time that Qatar Airways has been given this global recognition.
