Police officers commended for exceptional service during Esala Perahera

All police personnel who performed Perahera duties for the duration of the Kandy Esala Pageant of the Sri Dalada Maligawa, have come in for special appraisal by IGP Pujith Jayasundara who had ordered that they be given three days special leave as a reward for performing their duties well.
A contingent of 3,750 policemen and women performed perahera duties for a period of 11 days in 16 demarcated zones under 32 Command Officers. The IGP had ordered that they be granted official leave in a manner that will not disrupt normal police duties.
Meanwhile, the Police Department has taken steps to grant cash rewards from the police fund to a batch of ten officers who had rendered exceptional service during the perahera.
They include a Chief Inspector, female Police Inspector and a Sub-Inspector.
