Justice League:
Exceptional and ebullient

Combining some of the foremost characters of the DC universe, Justice League delivers an action-packed, visually-pleasing superhero movie which is rather ebullient in comparison with its predecessors, albeit with a few shortcomings.
Following Superman’s demise at the hands of Doomsday in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Batman discovers that the world now faces the very threat he was previously warned of; another alien invasion. Leading an army of parademons, the Apokoliptian known as Steppenwolf seeks to gather three sentient, extraterrestrial supercomputers called motherboxes capable of manipulating energy, in order to reshape the Earth in the image of his home-planet, Apokolips—an objective he was once prevented from achieving thousands of years into the past by the united forces of the Amazonians, Atlanteans, and mankind, amongst other powerful beings. In order to prevent humanity’s impending doom, Batman, realising that he cannot stand against these nemeses alone, sets out to ally other meta-humans possessing special abilities, namely The Flash, Aquaman, and Cyborg, with the aid of Wonder Woman.
Smoother flow
The storyline and plot progression possessed an allure and established a stage for most of the superheroes to sufficiently display their powers and abilities. However, a few scene transitions in the beginning of the movie lacked a certain level of fluidity, and the movie as a whole, did feel rushed, perhaps due to the fact that Warner Bros. mandated a runtime of under two hours. As events unfolded thereafter, however, the movie attained a smoother flow. Although Steppenwolf’s intentions were known from the early stages of the movie and no significant plot twists were present, Justice League counterbalances those setbacks as it manages to present stunning battle scenes accompanied by exceptional visual effects.
The dialogues compellingly conveyed the mysteries surrounding the incursion and the motherboxes, while hinting at what is to make its advent in the future of the franchise. The fears and regrets that the main protagonists bear in their hearts are effectively addressed, while their tragic pasts, although illuminated, still hold a certain mystery reserved for their upcoming standalone movies. The heroes learn to recognise and address their flaws in order to overcome the restrictions they impose upon themselves. The movie also brings out some enjoyable humour, even from characters who would usually not be inclined to do so. A noteworthy change that DC made with Justice League is the omission of its usual metaphors and parables, which was coherent with their previously darker, more dramatic essence.
The bonding between characters was quite entertaining, and was a pillar that firmly supported the story’s charm. The main cast’s portrayal of their respective characters was consistent, as was it moving when needed be.
Newfound team
Batman, riddled with guilt, is seen on a journey for absolution, seeking to honour the memory of Superman. However, that very guilt is shown to lead him to make precarious decisions, albeit calculated.
He also attempts to co-operate with his newfound team, which deems challenging and leads him to be arrogant and insincere on certain occasions.
Wonder Woman still remains the unwavering, brave warrior, and learns to conquer her fear of leadership.
The Flash being socially-awkward, over-enthusiastic, and hyperactive; and Aquaman, with his charismatic and exuberant personality; bring in much amusement to the screen.
Cyborg is initially portrayed as dispirited, as he is still learning to accept and adapt to his new cybernetic body which was born of a motherbox, but grows to be more hopeful and cheery towards the movie’s conclusion.
Considering Steppenwolf, although he was presented as a challenging villain for the most part, there was no solid foundation or room allocated to build more character depth for him.
The Computer-Generated Imagery (CGI) involved in the movie, especially considering the depiction of the surges of electricity related to the Speed Force, and the battle involving Steppenwolf and Aquaman in Atlantis, was brilliant. The final battle between the League and the parademons, with the collaboration of CGI and cinematography, was enthralling as well, and the dark yet vivid, fiery filter introduced to the environs in which it commences, along with the booming bombardments that take place in its presence, was captivating to the eye.
Even though DC proceeded in a different direction this time and succeeded in delivering a crowd-pleasing spectacle with Justice League, it was achieved at the cost of the usual solidity they offer. Nevertheless, with this movie, DC lays the foundation for a wider range of movies to come.
