Dickwella axed for Hero Nidahas trophy tri-series

First choice wicket-keeper for quite some time Niroshan Dickwella has been dropped from the Sri Lankan squad of 15 named for the three-nation T20 international Hero Nidahas trophy from March 6-18 at the R Premadasa Stadium.
Dickwella has not been in the best of form in recent ODI and T20I matches and his wicket-keeping duties will in all probability be filled by Kusal Perera who has returned to the side after an injury.
Dickwella has made only one half century in his last 17 ODI innings since scoring back to back hundreds against Zimbabwe at Hambantota last July and, in T20Is, he scored only 39 runs in three innings in India last December and made 11 in the first T20I against Bangladesh recently before being dropped for the second game.
Test captain Dinesh Chandimal who led Sri Lanka to victory over Bangladesh in the tri-series and T20 internationals in the absence of injured white ball captain Angelo Mathews, has been handed the task of leading his country once again in the T20 format.
Fast bowler Suranga Lakmal has been named Chandimal’s deputy
Other notable changes in the squad are the return of fast bowlers Nuwan Pradeep and Dushmantha Chameera and the inclusion of batsman Dhananjaya de Silva, whose last T20I appearance was against South Africa in January last year. These three players replace Dickwella, Jeffrey Vandersay and Shehan Madushanka (injured) from the Sri Lanka squad that won the T20I series 2-0 in Bangladesh.
The Hero Nidahas trophy tri-series commences on March 6 with Sri Lanka meeting India. Bangladesh are the third team taking part.
SRI LANKA SQUAD OF 15: Dinesh Chandimal (Captain), Upul Tharanga, Danushka Gunathilaka, Kusal Mendis, Dasun Shanaka, Kusal Perera, Thisara Perera, Jeewan Mendis, Suranga Lakmal (Vice Captain), Isuru Udana, Akila Dananjaya, Amila Aponso, Nuwan Pradeep, Dushmantha Chameera, Dhananjaya de Silva.
