Gen. Jayasuriya involved in misdeeds:Field Marshal Fonseka

Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka yesterday, said that he was aware that former Army Commander Jagath Jayasuriya was allegedly involved in wrongdoings.
“I was determined to take action against him after the war on terrorism was over,” Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka added.
Fonseka added that he received many complaints at that point that Jayasuriya had allegedly committed various offences.
If a proper mechanism was established to inquire into the alleged offences committed by Jayasuriya, I will provide my evidence against him, he said.
Fonseka added that he had informed former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to avoid appointing Jagath Jayasuriya as the Commander of Army.
“I have never admitted that he was capable of commanding the Sri Lanka Army after my tenure in the Army ended,” he added.
Fonseka said that the former ruler singled out Jayasuriya as the next Commander of the Sri Lanka Army at a time when there were around 15 officers above him in terms of seniority.
Addressing the media in Colombo yesterday, Fonseka said that former Army Commander Jayasuriya was dancing to the whims and fancies of the former Defence Secretary. “He led the Army to drag me into Prison,” Fonseka said.
Fonseka further said that there were several divisions in the battle field and they were brought under his direct command.
“The divisions in the battle field were not brought under Jayasuriya. He was the Vanni Security Forces Commander overseeing the front line bunker line in Vavuniya. He was only entrusted with providing logistic facilities to Army personnel in the battle field and evacuating of casualties. We are disappointed to hear the Sri Lanka Army being criticized at a time when it deserves accolades and proper recognition.
“Many crimes had taken place at some places and they should be inquired into and those responsible, should be punished so that the dignity of the Sri Lanka Army could be protected.
If any person has committed an offence, he should be punished according to the law of the country, Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said.
If all those who were involved in criminal activities were to be punished, the Sri Lanka Army would regain its lost dignity.
