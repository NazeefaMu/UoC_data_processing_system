President sought SC opinion on actual term of office

Two different views have been expressed in legal, civil and political circles about the duration of the term of Presidency after the enactment of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. In order to dispel this confusion, the President has sought the opinion of the Supreme Court regarding the actual term of office, the President’s Media Unit said in a statement.
According to the powers vested on the President under the Constitution, the President has the right to seek the opinion of the Supreme Court. The former Presidents who held office had also sought the opinion of the Supreme Court during their tenures. It is a significant feature in the constitutions of democratic governance, it added.
