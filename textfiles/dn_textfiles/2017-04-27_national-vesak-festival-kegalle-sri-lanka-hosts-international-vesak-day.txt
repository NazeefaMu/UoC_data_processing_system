National Vesak Festival in Kegalle as Sri Lanka hosts International Vesak Day in kandy and colombo

The country’s National Vesak Festival will be held in the Kegalle District. The government has imparted nearly Rs.1,000 million for the organisation of the festival and related development activities.
President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe are due to open the National Vesak Festival on March 10.
“We are proud to have the official National Vesak festival in our historic district, which is the region of the Satara Koralaya of Maya Rata,” Kegalle District Leader of UNP and Enterprises Development Minister Kabir Hashim said Monday at a press conference at his ministry.
“We see this as a boon bestowed on us to improve the region’s infrastructure and facilities in parallel with the arrangements to hold the festival,” he said.
He said The Buddha’s teachings are not restricted to any particular nation or any ethnicity.The Buddhist doctrine teaches us to spread our love and compassion to animals. The noble teachings of the Buddha are for whole of mankind. It teaches us to how we may live to the fullest without any affliction from pain and sorrowfulness.
“When the topic is on celebration of Vesak, our thoughts naturally flow over to the Kelaniya Raja Maha Vihara,” the minister said and added,“Although the Kelaniya Raja Maha is regarded or so named as the main place for celebrating Buddhist events, we believe that Wattarama Rajamaha Vihara in Kegalle, where one of the Detis Palaruwa Bodhi Tree branches is located and Sri Lanka’s last known Arahath Wanaguptha Maliyadewa Maha Thera had lived, can also be regarded as having similar importance for holding important Buddhist events.”
“In view of Vesak celebrations at Wattarama Rajamaha Vihara this year,a large number of Smaneras will be ordained to the the Maha Sangha.The government will provide patronage to the ordination ceremonies,” Hashim said.
He said when the historic Wattarama temple was donated to the order of Buddhst monks by King Sirisangabo’s brother King Gotabhaya, it was done so by ordaining 12 000 laymen into the order.
“Therefore,I think the decision by the government to hold the festival in Kegalle is of great significance,” said Hashim.
We have set out plans to celebrate the festival while ensuring the participation of both Buddhist and non-Buddhist public.
He said after their ascent to power in 2016, he and Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya requested at a Cabinet meeting that holding of the National Vesak Festival be given to the Kegalla district. As there had been problems as regards availability of certain infrastructure facilities in the district, the festival was destined to go to the Hambathota district that year, he said.
He said Minister Siyambalapitiya and he made the same request in 2017 and President Maithripala Sirisena approved it .
Commenting on the work they have carried out, Hashim said,”to give due place for Buddhism and to invigorate Buddhist activities during Vesak, we took steps with the Ministry of Buddha Shasana to upgrade the Wattarama Raja Maha Vihara temple.”
“The infrastructure around the temple too have been developed side by side with the program. Main access roads and village roads have been improved,” he said. .
“The government has put millions to the activities.The Ministry of Highways has invested money to build a car park for the temple so that those patronizing the temple can use it.”
“Actions are being taken to provide pipe borne water to many areas in the Kegalla district as part of the program,” he said.
“Power and Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya has done much to improve electricity in the district, “he said.
There are 669 Buddhist temples in the Kegalle district with 40 Raja Maha Vihara temples, 584 Sunday Dhamma Schools, and 42 Pirivenas. Besides, there are 261 archeological protected Buddhist monuments.
“The Ministry of Buddha Shasana after meeting the Nayaka Theras of the temples, took necessary measures to improve facilities in them,” he said.
Not only the political leadership, but also the leadership at district and Pradeshiya level, the GA and all officers have contributed to the success of these development activities, the minister said.
Hashim said they decided to go the extra mile to improve the conditions of the temples that is to do something other than what the Ministry of Buddha Shasana has been doing.
"We sought assistance of donors in the district. We actually prepared a plan to carry out necessary infrastructure development in temples," he said.
"We also discussed with the embassy of Thailand. They promised us to extend their support to hold the r National Vesak Festival," he added.
He said upon learning that most Buddhist temples in the district did not comprise essential twelve segments that a temple should have; they decided to provide necessary funds to construct those facilities.
"We are going to construct kitchens for the use of some Pirivenas which do not have such facilities under the program. We have already placed action to provide them with gas cookers," Hashim added.
Speaking on the arrangements of Vesak Zones to he had, Hashim said, “Because the International Day of Vesak will be hosted by Sri Lanka this year,we expect that there will be a considerable influx of foreign nationals into the country during Vesak.”
The international commemorations will include an International Buddhist Conference, with the participation of over 400 delegates from over 100 countries.
“Since the delegates will be using the Colombo –Mahanuwara road, all Vesak organisers are keen on decorating that road all along,” he said. “The Internationa Vesak Day will be held in Mahanuwara.” the Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka has undertaken to sponsor a main Vesak Zone at Kegalla Nidahas Mawatha, where a Vesak lak lantern competition, Vesak Bhakthi Gee (songs) and essay competitions would be held.
“They will be held in other Vesak Zones. There will be Dan Salas in respective Vesak zones. Not only Buddhists but also communities belonging to other religions too will be holding Dan Salas at Vesak zones. Some Muslim nationals have agreed to conduct a Dansala to signify national reconciliation,” the minister said.
"There will be a main Vesak Zone in the city of Kegalle. The whole of Mawanella electorate is to be made a Vesak Zone,"he said.
Members of the Mahasangha from the Kegalle District including Ven.Panagamuwe Dhammarathana Thera, Ven.Eladatte Saddhaseela Thera,GA Chandrasiri Bandara, Kegalle Electorate UNP Organiser Lilan Amaratunga and Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka Chairmam Sujeewa Lokuhewa were present at the press conference.
