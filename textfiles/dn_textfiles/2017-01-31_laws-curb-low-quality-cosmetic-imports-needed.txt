Laws to curb low quality cosmetic imports needed

  Sri Lankan needs stronger laws to curb the import of low quality cosmetics to Sri Lanka,‘4Ever Skin Naturals Chairperson Chandani Bandara said.Speaking to Daily News Business at the Jaffna International Trade Fair, she said the local cosmetics industry is very strong and vibrant and needs to be protected against low priced competition. She said that today local cosmetics are also being imported not only to Asian countries but also to Europe which speaks volumes of the quality of local products. “In this back drop it’s unfair to have low priced items being dumped in Sri Lanka.” She said the current tax structure has not been reviewed recently and it urgently needs a review.” Asked if the Association related to them is not taking up this matter she said they are lethargic and almost inactive.
