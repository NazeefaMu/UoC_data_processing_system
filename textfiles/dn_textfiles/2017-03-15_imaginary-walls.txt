Imaginary Walls

The walls are everywhere. There are walls around our houses. Along the roads, around the religious places, in the cities, between countries, and at almost all the places where human habitations are walls stand. Another aspect is that people seem to have spent a great deal of their hard earned money on these structures. There is a mad rat race in the society to build walls. People are in an unending competition to build the tallest, most beautiful, most expensive, most modern wall around their properties. The story does not end there, their annual expenditure to colourwash them and keep them neat and tidy goes to thousands, if not millions of rupees.
The primary function of a wall is to enclose, divide, separate or protect something. Any philosopher, a religious leader, a great thinker, a scientist or any poet or dramatist has never recommended walls. If walls had been a need in the world for the existence of man, God would have created them with other creations. This preamble on walls compels me to think that walls are of no need to man. All the religious leaders expect us to coexist. The walls pose an insurmountable obstacle against such a mode of living. Thus, the pith of the matter is that it is high time for all the rulers, economists politicians and world leaders to pay their urgent attention to devote some time on this hitherto unexplored aspect. A wall-less world would be the panacea for most of our ills. Our national coffers would not go empty, but the construction industry would affect. Thousands of engineers would lose their careers. The contractors would come to the roads. They will trace the writer and make him maimed, in their wrath.
In order to save my skin, I take a U-turn and would like to draw the attention of the rational minded readers towards another kind of walls existing in the world. They are imaginary walls. No one can see or touch them, they are the ugliest walls I can ever imagine. All the spiritual leaders, saints and wise men have condemned them. They are the meanest. Yet, the unfathomable bitter truth is that almost all the people in every faith are adhered to them. Their cruel heart and mind don’t allow them to escape from them. Once you are entangled to them it is inescapable. People are sentenced to life time imprisonment inside their own walls. But they are responsible for the crimes they do under this cover at the reckoning. The pink gate is ever closed to them.
These imaginary walls are
The wall between the rich and the poor. The caste system Religions Ethnicity Political parties So called social status – different social milieu Cultures Skin colour or complexion Language Culture
The above array is only a rough picture of walls that keep people separated. It is crystal clear that all these walls do irreparable damage to the dignity of man. In fact, it is infra dig for sensible peoples to uphold the oddities and foibles forever in the human society. It seems that man is devoid of sense and sensibility. Man has great expectations but his inner disposition does not trigger him to look forward.
Man is always mending these walls. He doesn’t seem to have an earnest desire to be devoid of these ignoble character traits. The reader may find this as a diatribe by a frustrated character, but the writer is backed substantial evidence from the tapestry of literature. Robert Frost, the twentieth century best American poet, was at the forefront who advocated this aspect of social inquiry-May his tribe increase!
His crusade was to initiate a global village where there are no walls, I mean a wall-less world in which every member who belongs to specific castes, religions, culture, skin colours, political parties, languages, etc, this iconic piece of poetry composed by the aforementioned poet of universal acclaim .His poetic theory is ‘A poem should begin with delight and end in wisdom’ The celebrated first line of this poem titled ‘MENDING WALL’ is as follows,
‘Something there is that doesn’t like a wall’
Nature is this something. Man makes walls anywhere and everywhere as he wants, he does it in an arbitrary manner. He seems to think that nature is his own property. But according to the Red Indian chief Seattle, man is only one thread of nature. Man is not the sole owner of nature. Nature belongs to flora and fauna, avifauna and all the other infinitesimal creatures. Man proposes and God disposes. Nature topples the man-made walls by sending huge roots beneath the walls. Liquid formation and the swelling process of the roots complete the breaking down process of the walls. When these walls are broken in that way at the ground level, the sunlight heats the upper part of the wall. The huge stones of the upper part fall to the ground. In addition to this physical process, the hunters speed up the breaking process. Huge gaps of the wall invite animals and people who need easy access and the gaps become wide. Mending becomes a necessity. In this light, people also mend their imaginary walls of miscellaneous nature through ignorance. The irony is that, in agricultural communities they mend their walls in a particular season, but man mends his imaginary walls of separation all the time. Communal riots, ethnic crises, religious forays, language issues, cultural disturbances, and fanning racial flames are some of the tips of the iceberg of the consequences of having imaginary walls. Unimaginable tragedy is that the iconic literary figures, young politicians, world acclaimed intellectuals of high caliber take the vanguard in such national calamities. They fuel any kind of unrest in the country to reach their short-sighted nefarious ends.
