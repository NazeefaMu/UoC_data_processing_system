IASL recognizes top industry achievers

The Insurance Association of Sri Lanka (IASL) hosted the Life Insurance Industry Awards Ceremony recently in Colombo for the first time.
This was in celebration and commemoration of the success of the ‘Life Insurance Awareness Month’ campaign that was held during the month of September,
The principle objective of the event was to recognize and reward the top sales producers and sales officers of the Life Insurance Industry, especially those who contributed to the success of the ‘Life Insurance Awareness Month’ campaign.
100 of the top sales officers were presented with special awards during the ceremony. Due to the success of the campaign the industry achieved a 30% growth in new policies in the month of September 2015.
The Managing Director and Vice President of LIMRA/LOMA, Ian Watts presided over the ceremony as Chief Guest while Indrani Sugathadasawas was the Guest of Honour.
Other principle attendees included Damayanthi Fernando the Director General of IBSL.
The foundation of the campaign and the awards ceremony is the bond between all those in the insurance industry who worked tirelessly to ensure the development and enhancement of life insurance in Sri Lanka.
This point was emphasized by Dirk Pereira, who congratulated the IASL on its “ability to bring everyone together” in his welcome speech whilst also thanking everyone for their contributions to ensure the success of the campaign.
