Massive campaign to plant jak saplings islandwide

Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera inaugurated a massive campaign of planting ten lakhs of jak plants in the island on June 11 in Panadura.
Jak tree planting campaign had been launched by Arthur V. Dias in Panadura during the British War. His motive behind this initiative was to use the jak fruit as a substitute for rice when hungry. Thousands of school children, teachers together with the public supported his campaign and he was known among the school children as Kosmama.
“Yahapalanaya Govt Ministry of Agriculture had decided to launch the massive campaign of planting 10 lakhs of jak plants in the country”, Minister Mahinda Amaraweera launching the campaign in Panadura said.
The simple ceremony was held at the Panadura Jeramius Diyas Vidyalaya on June 11 remembering the 100 Anniversary of launching the jak planting campaign by late Arthur V. Dias who is a national hero in Panadura.
The Minister distributed jak plants among the school children, teachers and the public. Deputy Minister Agith Perera, Chairman of the Panadura Urban Council Nandana Gunathileke with Town Councillors were present to grace the occasion with agricultural officials.
