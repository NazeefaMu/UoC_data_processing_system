Spring dawns on Lankan economy: IMF Head

There is spring in the air and in the global economy too which is also the case with the Sri Lankan economy that is improving at a satisfactory pace, International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Christine Lagarde told the media at the IMF, World Bank Spring Meetings last week in Washington.
Sri Lanka has a three-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme with the IMF since mid last year seeking to boost the balance of payment and ensure sound financial footing to support infrastructure development in the country.
“The Sri Lankan economy is improving and will do well this year,” Lagarde said.
The IMF mission held its second review on the Sri Lankan economy in March prior to releasing its second tranche of the USD 1.5 billion loan under the EFF programme.
The mission commended the government for its efforts to implement their IMF-supported economic reform programme with all fiscal quantitative targets.
However, the mission noted that foreign reserves fell short of the target. Progress on implementing structural benchmarks was uneven with some of the reforms lagging behind intended timelines.
However, the mission left certain concerns such as the implementation of structural benchmarks which the policymakers had failed to meet timelines to be discussed at the Spring meetings in Washington this month.
However the IMF is optimistic that the Sri Lankan economy will do well this year if it implements the structural reforms and ensures better tax administration to improve revenue . The Central Bank, a couple of moons ago, predicted economic growth to be around 5. to 5.5 percent this year up from 4.8 percent last year. However, the bank noted that downside risks to the economy from adverse weather and global uncertainties could hamper growth.
On the global economy, the IMF in its Out Look projected the world economy to do better this year and in the next. “The global economy has picked up momentum which will be sustained in the medium to long term. Sensible and sound policies have helped push economic growth which we see to reach 3.5 percent this year and 3.6 percent in 2018 up from 3.1 percent in 2016," Lagarde said.
“This is good news, but the growth momentum should be sustained. It should be shared equitably,” the IMF Chief said. She said further progress hinges on policies to support recovery, lift productivity growth and enhance resilience.
“Against the backdrop of rapid technological progress, a cooperative multilateral framework for trade and financial integration has served countries well producing large economic benefits. However, some groups have not been able to share these benefits,” Lagarde said
The IMF also noted that there could be possible downside risks to the global economy from political uncertainty and external shocks.
Economists have been concerned over inward policies of the Trump administration, protectionism from advanced economies and high credit growth in China which could have spillovers to emerging economies.
“The green shoots of 2011 did not last long. The member states of the IMF will discuss how the growth momentum could be sustained. Even with uncertainty, we need to see how the growth is sustained with inclusive growth,” Lagarde said.
She said the IMF will pay attention to re-invigorate productivity which is low in many advanced and emerging economies and promote inclusive growth with policies within countries and across countries. The IMF will pay attention to promote infrastructure investments, revising housing policy and protecting future generations from imprudent policies of the present generation.
Lagarde said the Fund is pleased to see trade picking up and underscored the importance of trade as an engine of growth.
‘We will support trade development across the globe and how it could be done efficiently,” Lagarde said.
