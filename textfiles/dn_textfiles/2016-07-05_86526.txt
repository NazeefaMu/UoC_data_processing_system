Federer, Murray look to pounce on Djokovic absence

London Sunday: Roger Federer and Andy Murray will attempt to make the most of Novak Djokovic’s shock Wimbledon exit and book their places in the quarter-finals on Monday.
Federer, the seven-time champion, had been seeded to face world number one Djokovic in the semi-finals having lost the 2014 and 2015 championship matches to the Serb at the All England Club.
Now, the 34-year-old is comfortably the favourite to reach his 11th final from the top half of the draw.
But first he must get past Steve Johnson, the world number 29 from the United States who has never before made the last 16 at a Grand Slam event.
Federer said it was unreasonable to expect Djokovic, who had held all four Slam titles, to keep on winning.
“I always said it: the first week is tough. Margins are small. I know we get carried away, we think it’s impossible to beat him, all these things. Clearly he’s beatable. It’s not impossible,” said the Swiss.
“He cannot win straight 200 matches in tennis. You’re going to have your losses.”
Johnson won on grass at Nottingham and was a quarter-finalist at Queen’s in the Wimbledon build-up. But he has never played Federer.
“I think it’s going to be exciting. I have never played on Centre,” said the 26-year-old.
“It’s going to be a great experience. I’m going to go out there thinking I’m going to be the winner. I have no fear out there.”
Second seed Murray, the 2013 champion, has breezed into the fourth round without dropping a set. But he faces a tough task on Monday against Australian 15th seed Nick Kyrgios.
Murray has a 4-0 career lead over the Australian with three of those meetings having come in the four majors. AFP
