Struggling cities in focus

The Japanese Architectural Exhibition ‘Struggling Cities: from Japanese Urban Projects in the 1960’s’ was held at the University of Moratuwa, Katubedda, Moratuwa, recently. The event was organized by the Japanese Embassy in Sri Lanka and sponsored by Japan Foundation.
This is a travelling exhibition, which showcases experimental ideas and proposals by Japanese Architects that emerged and flourished in Japan in the 1960s. The exhibition analyses how the designs, radical for their time, attempted to address the concerns of various countries facing over-population issues.
It also features works by renowned architects with their distinctive urban plan designs in addressing the above issue.
