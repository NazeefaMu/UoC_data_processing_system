Trott fires Warwickshire to One-Day Cup glory

LONDON, Saturday: Former England batsman Jonathan Trott scored an unbeaten 82 off 100 balls as Warwickshire crushed Surrey by eight wickets in England's One-Day Cup final at Lord's on Saturday.
Set just 137 to win, Warwickshire cruised to victory with 118 balls to spare for the loss of just two wickets.
Tim Ambrose was also unbeaten at the close on 22, after captain Ian Bell had fallen for 17 and Sam Hain for 12. Rory Burns top-scored for Surrey with 40.
South Africa-born Trott, who retired from international cricket in May 2015, settled the match with a cover drive off the bowling of Sam Curran.
Bell told BBC radio: "Trotty was outstanding. If I could choose one person to knock off a total like that, it would be Jonathan Trott."
Surrey had started steadily, advancing to 99-2, only to collapse, losing eight wickets for 37 runs in just 15 overs.
Three batsmen failed to score, including veteran skipper Gareth Batty, who was handed an England recall on Friday after 11 years in the international wilderness.
Former Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara was dismissed for 21.
Chris Woakes was Warwickshire's stand-out bowler, but Oliver Hannon-Dalby and spinners Jeetan Patel and Ateeq Javid also took two wickets each. It was a second successive One-Day Cup final loss for Surrey.
