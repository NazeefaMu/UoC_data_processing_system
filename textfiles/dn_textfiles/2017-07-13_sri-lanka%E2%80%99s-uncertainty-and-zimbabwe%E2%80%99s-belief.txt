Sri Lanka’s uncertainty and Zimbabwe’s belief

ODI series review:
When Zimbabwe ranked 11th in the ODI standings and below Afghanistan arrived for a five-match one-day international series little did Sri Lanka realize what was in store for them.
The African nation’s track record was not all that great coming to Sri Lanka having lost a five-match ODI series 3-2 to Afghanistan and being held to a 1-all draw by associate member Scotland.
Sri Lanka who were a better all-round side than their counterparts was expected to beat Zimbabwe and consolidate their position in the ODI rankings where they are hanging onto rather precariously at eighth position. Playing at home under their home conditions and slow turning pitches was also in favour of Sri Lanka. So what went wrong for them in the series which they surprisingly lost 3-2?
The series began on a stunning note with Zimbabwe chasing down the highest ever ODI total achieved in Sri Lanka 322 in 47.4 overs. It was the first time that any team had chased 300 and over successfully.
That sort of run chase gave belief to the Zimbabweans that they could bat on any surface prepared by Sri Lanka for the series. Although Sri Lanka pulled back to win the next two matches and take a 2-1 lead, the Zimbabweans never lost hope. They brought new ideas into each game and tried various combinations and ploys to outwit the homesters. The fourth and crucial ODI was the turning point of the series. A win for Sri Lanka would have given them the series and for Zimbabwe they needed to win to keep the series alive.
Played at Hambantota, Zimbabwe overcame the strong crosswinds and the dry pitch to win that game on the Duckworth and Lewis rain rule after bad weather had interrupted play and forced a rescheduling of overs and a fresh target to chase. From Sri Lanka’s viewpoint they were in a way rather unlucky that after running up a total of 300-6 they would have fancied beating Zimbabwe had the match gone its full distance. But instead Zimbabwe was left to chase 219 in 31 overs and they got there with 10 balls to spare. Sri Lanka could have still restricted Zimbabwe to a lower score or bowled them out if not for an appalling display of bowling where juicy full tosses and half volleys were bowled which the Zimbabwe batsmen accepted with glee and punched to the boundary. That win squared the series 2-all and gave the Zimbabweans a further impetus for the decisive fifth and final ODI also played at Hambantota.
Suddenly it was Sri Lanka who were under pressure to win and with it the series. Eventually the pressure got to them and they were restricted to an under par total of 203, their batting falling to spin with seven of the eight wickets falling to them. Zimbabwe came to this crucial game with a plan as they opened the bowling with the off-spin of Sikander Raza instead of their fast bowlers. That ploy caught the Sri Lankan openers Niroshasn Dickwella and Danushka Gunathilaka who had in the two previous games reeled off successive double century partnerships (a world record) off guard. Instead of being 200 for none they were 31-3 by the ninth over and slid further down the mire to 126-7 before a record half-century ninth wicket stand by Asela Gunaratne and Dushmantha Chameera brought some respectability and gave their bowlers a total to bowl at. Zimbabwe was not going to let slip such a golden opportunity of winning a maiden ODI series in Sri Lanka and they went about chasing down the target briskly with inform openers Hamilton Masakadza and Solomon Mire laying the foundation for them with a stand of 92 in 15 overs. Although Sri Lanka fought back gallantly capturing seven wickets for 175, Zimbabwe who bats deep had enough resources to see them through. Skipper Graeme Cremer and Raza the Man of the Match saw Zimbabwe home to a historic series win – one which they will cherish for a long time in their rather chequered history.
It was a wonderfully contested series with so many individual stand-out performances – Solomon Mire’s maiden ODI century in the first game at Galle, the hat-trick on debut by Richmond College schoolboy Wanindu Hasaranga in the second match also at Galle, the back to back double century partnerships by Dickwella and Gunathilaka in the third and fourth matches and, the batting of Hamilton Masakadza coupled with the all-round brilliance of Sikander Raza in the fifth ODI – all at Hambantota.
The frustrations and the inconsistent performances of the team proved too much of a pressure for Angelo Mathews to put up with constantly. He had struggled to keep the team together following the retirements of legends like Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara and Tillakaratne Dilshan. At the end of the series he tended his resignation as captain from all formats of the game.
First it was Graham Ford who resigned as head coach at the end of the Champions Trophy and now less than a month later Mathews from the Sri Lanka captaincy at the end of the Zimbabwe series.
Things are certainly not looking that bright for Sri Lanka cricket and its future at the moment. Their fortunes need a complete turnaround. Where Sri Lanka’s next series win will come from is anybody’s guess.
