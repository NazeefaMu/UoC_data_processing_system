President regrets tear gas attack on monks

President Maithripala Sirisena expressed regret over the inconvenience caused to Buddhist monks due to the tear gas attack, when a group of Buddhist monks representing several organizations including Sinhalaye Api National Organization visited the President’s Office to handover a message on November 19. They had not intimated earlier that they would come to handover a message to the President. However, the President instructed to take immediate action to conduct an inquiry on the matter. The President engaged in friendly discussions with the Venerable Theras. He accepted the letter presented by them over the judicial matters of Ven. Galagodatte Gnanasara Thera.
