Kiriella objects to Bimal raising COPE report issue, Speaker overrules

Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella yesterday in Parliament strongly objected to JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake when he was raising a matter related to the COPE report on the Treasury Bonds investigation.
Minister Kiriella said MP Rathnayake should not be allowed to speak as it is a matter before court now. However, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya allowed the MP to raise the matter stating that he was speaking on behalf of all members of COPE.
“He was talking about summons being received by the COPE members. I have to look at the legal aspect of the matter. I have to listen to it,” the Speaker said.
MP Rathnayake pointed out that he was raising a matter related to Parliament and the Speaker also agreed with the MP. However, Minister Kiriella went on objecting and MP Rathnayake asked in return whether he has taken over the role of the Speaker.
Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera supporting Kiriella’s argument said MP Rathnayake could not speak on behalf of all COPE members, but could only raise it as a personal privilege question.
“If a statement is made on behalf of the Committee, Committee Chairman Sunil Handunnetti should first inquire the opinions of other COPE members” he said.
Kiriella intervening again said those in the COPE should know that the country is being ruled by the Government and not by the COPE.
The Speaker however said that he would look into the matter raised MP Rathnayake. “Let me handle it,” he replied.
