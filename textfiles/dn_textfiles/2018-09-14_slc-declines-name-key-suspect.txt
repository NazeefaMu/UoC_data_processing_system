Alleged embezzlement of US$ 5.5m to offshore account
SLC declines to  name key suspect

Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) yesterday refused to disclose the name of the key suspect involved in the alleged transfer of US$ 5.5 million to a bank outside Sri Lanka.
The money was due from Sony Television who bought the rights to telecast England’s tour of Sri Lanka starting next month.
The key suspect is said to be the man in charge of finances at Sri Lanka Cricket.He has already been sent on leave pending investigations by the CID and FCID.
SLC said they were looking into the possibility of a cyber crime committed by the suspect.
However SLC said they would not hide anything from the investigation and co-operate with the CID.
“We will not hide anything and co-operate with the CID and FCID to ensure the matter will be resolved and the suspect brought to book,” Sri Lanka Cricket’s Sports Minister appointed Competent Authority Kamal Pathmasiri told a media conference held at the SLC yesterday.
“I’m happy the way CEO Ashley Silva has handled the matter and made statements to the CID,” he said.Pathmasiri further said: “So far we have handled the issue well and made initial investigation from SLC and we have handed over to the CID and FCID for further investigation. We have not revealed the name of the suspect due to the ongoing investigation.”
SLC’s IT Head Nadeeshan Sooriyarachchi said this was not a hacking incident and all the e-mail conversations were done through the SLC server.“We have all the evidence and have submitted it to the CID Cyber Crimes Unit and the FCID.”
SLC CEO Ashley De Silva lodged a complaint with the FCID and the Finance Division has been sealed since then.
The attempted fraud of 5.5 million US dollars by an employee of Sri Lanka Cricket has become one of the most talked about issues in cricket circles today.
