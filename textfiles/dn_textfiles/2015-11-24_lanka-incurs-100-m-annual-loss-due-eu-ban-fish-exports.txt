Lanka incurs $ 100 m annual loss due to EU ban on fish exports

The country incurs a US $ 100 million annual loss due to the ban on fish exports by the European Union, Fisheries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
Addressing the National Fisheries Day celebrations, Amaraweera said the EU used to buy 68 percent of Sri Lankan fish while Sri Lanka was still placed as the second largest tuna exporter to the region.
“We are hopeful that we could get the EU ban lifted. The EU has made recommendations to Sri Lanka to re-enter the market. Establishing a Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) was a significant recommendation,” the minister said.
The European Commission announced a ban on imports of fisheries products from Sri Lanka from January 1 for the failure to tackle illegal fishing.
The minister said the new system would monitor the activities of trawler boats and curb illegal fishing in Sri Lankan waters.
He said politicians in Tamil Nadu are responsible persons for this issue.
“We will never let fishermen in foreign vessels catch fish in Sri Lankan waters in the future,” he said.
