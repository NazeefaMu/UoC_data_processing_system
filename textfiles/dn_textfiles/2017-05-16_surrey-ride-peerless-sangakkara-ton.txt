Surrey ride on peerless Sangakkara ton

LONDON, Sunday : Surrey stayed on course for a quarterfinal berth in the Royal London Cup as the peerless Kumar Sangakkara scored an unbeaten 124 to guide his side to a comfortable victory over Hampshire at the Oval. Sangakkara added 93 for the second wicket with Mark Stoneman (53 off 52) and then an unbeaten 128-run stand with Rory Burns (39 n.o. off 54) before rain hit the Oval. With no signs of the showers relenting, the game was awarded to Surrey, who were 66 runs ahead of the corresponding Duckworth-Lewis score.
Sangakkara’s stylish effort was preceded by an equally ebullient effort from George Bailey, who struck an unbeaten 132-ball 145 to drag Hampshire from the depths of despair to a total of respectability. Ravi Rampaul’s opening burst and excellent follow-up acts from the Curran brother to reduce Hampshire to 89 for 7 before Kyle Abbott joined Bailey. The 152-run stand - a record for Hampshire for the eighth wicket - helped the visitors post 271 in the 50 overs before Hampshire were undone by another Sangakkara special.
At Leicester, Leicestershire bowlers, led by pacers Dieter Klein (3-46) and Gavin Griffiths (3-44), helped keep the team’s slender hopes of making the quarterfinal alive, as they beat Derbyshire by five wickets. Alex Hughes’s unbeaten 96 went in vain as none of the other batsmen could make sizeable contributions and provide him with ample support as Derbyshire were bundled out for 219.
Samit Patel scored an unbeaten century and added a 181-run stand with Steven Mullaney to help Nottinghamnshire chase down Lancashire’s 260 and keep their campaign alive at Nottingham.
Bottom-placed Warwickshire upset the apple-cart with a surprising win over Yorkshire, whose chances of making a direct entry into the semis were dented. Jonathan Trott (70) and Ian Bell (98) nullified Joe Root’s innings-setting 83 and a 116-run partnership with Tim Bresnan (65) and Matthew Waite (71) to take Warwickshire to a five-wicket win and hence, off the last spot in the points table.
John Hastings and Daryl Mitchell picked up three wickets each to defy Durham and take Worcestershire on the verge of a semifinal spot, despite a maiden List A century from Durham opener Graham Clark.
