Walk to end Alzheimer’s on Sept 29

Walk to end Alzheimer’s is an annual event organized by the Lanka Alzheimer’s Foundation (LAF) to bring together our community, raise awareness on how to lend care, love and support and more importantly combat stigma. Sun or rain, participants enthusiastically walk creating awareness of the disease, distributing leaflets to onlookers along the way.
Cinnamon Grand’s Angsana Garden is the venue where ‘walkers’ must gather at 8 am to meet, mingle and have fellowship prior to the commencement of the walk. Memorabilia and raffle tickets are available for sale at the venue. The Walk starts at 8.30 am and a 5 kilometer route has been mapped out taking you mostly through key roads in the Colpetty area. Police escort keeps the participants on track allowing easy access getting off and on to the Galle Road at several points. While Cinnamon Grand boasts their gracious hospitality, Pet Packaging offers complimentary bottles of water to all; Elephant House sponsors drinks, ice creams and refreshments, while Milo and Cargills await you at the end of the Walk to help you restore lost energy! Medi Calls since many years is available stand by for any emergency. Surprises are in store! 
Walkers Tours provides a luxury air conditioned coach for the elders, so that they too can enjoy the morning’s activities. Roshantha Sampath from Balloon Team since years provides brightly coloured Helium balloons to decorate the bus and the venue and for the kids to take home as a souvenir. Photographer Wasantha Jayasekera covers the event year in and year out and all of the above who have remained loyal to the Lanka Alzheimer’s Foundation who have believed in the cause since the inception.
The Raffle Draw culminates the event at the end of the walk where many attractive prizes await the winners.
This year, LAF is honoured that Johann Peries – who took Sri Lanka to the top of the world by climbing Mount Everest will be amongst the enthusiasts who will attend the walk. Many pictures from last year’s walk says it all. Be there on Saturday, September 29.
