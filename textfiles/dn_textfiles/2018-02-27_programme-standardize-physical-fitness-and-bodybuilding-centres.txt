Programme to standardize Physical Fitness and Bodybuilding centres

All Physical Fitness and Bodybuilding centres of the island will be standardized and all instructors and trainers will be awarded a national level certificate after a training. Issuing a statement, Sports Ministry informed that the project proposal with recommendations on standardizing the centers was compiled by a committee headed by former veteran athlete Aleilima has been handed over to the Sports Minister.
According to the proposal minimum requirements will be introduced to Physical Fitness and Bodybuilding centres such as space, equipment and other facilities.
A licensing system too will be introduced and the committee suggests that the license must display in all centres. New courses for instructors and trainers will be introduced, so they can improve their knowledge and skills while receiving a nationally recognized certificate.
As a first step Sports Ministry will conduct an awareness programme on February 27 at, 2pm at the Sports Ministry's Duncan White auditorium. The sports Ministry invites all Physical Fitness and Bodybuilding centres to send a representative to participate in the workshop.
