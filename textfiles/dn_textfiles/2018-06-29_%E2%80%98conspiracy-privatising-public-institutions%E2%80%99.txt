‘Conspiracy of privatising public institutions’

A member of the Group of 16, Parliamentarian Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena yesterday charged that the government has entered into a conspiracy of privatising public institutions and enterprises following the advice of the IMF and World Bank (WB).
Addressing the media yesterday at the Nidahas Madya Kendraya in Punchi Borella, Abeywardena said that most public enterprises are scheduled to be privatised in the next two years and it is necessary to take immediate measures to control this situation. government and opposition members of Parliament should understand the economic crisis prevailing in the country, he said. “The economic growth of the country has been reduced to 3.2 percent by the first quarter of 2018 and it was at 7.1 percent in 2014. The unemployment rate in the country has increased to 4.2 by the end 2017 and it was at 3.7 percent in 2014. The inflation rate has increased by 3.2 percent in 2018 first quarter compared to 2017 first quarter, he said.
The group of 16 SLFP Parliamentarians yesterday proposed a seven-point recommendation to avoid a possible recession in 2020.
The seven points are: the responsibility of economic management should be given to a person who has the capacity to perform that task, the government should call an early general election, PM Ranil Wickremesinghe’s government should accept their inability to govern, the government should realise that selling public property is not the only solution for the issues prevailing in the country, the government should stop showing the money earned by selling public property as FDI, an independent Presidential Commission should be appointed to look into the prevailing financial crisis, and the present government should reveal the names of economic assassins.
