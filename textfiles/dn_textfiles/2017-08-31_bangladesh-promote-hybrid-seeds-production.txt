Bangladesh to promote hybrid seeds production

Internationally renowned Lalteers Seed Production Company in Bangladesh has agreed to invest in Sri Lanka to promote hybrid seeds production and exchange of genetic resources.
There is a 300-acre land belonging to Mahailuppallama agriculture research and development institute not being used for project including cultivation for decades.
It is proposed to establish the hybrid seeds production plant complex in this premise. This is a joint venture involving Lalteer Company and the Agriculture Department, Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake said.
The Mahailuppallama seeds farm would not be sold to Bangladesh nor will it be leased out, he said.
It has been proposed to start a hybrid seeds exchange and production project at the Mahailuppallama agriculture research and development institute. Referring to this issue, Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake said there has been false propaganda by certain political groups to hoodwink the public.
The minister told the Daily News that around Rs. 1,400 million is spent annually for importing hybrid seeds.
This has been continuing although the Agriculture Department has been established 105 years ago.
Twenty three ministers including him have been holding the agriculture ministerial portfolio, Dissanayake said.
He appealed to the employees of the Mahailuppallama research and development centre seeds farms to understand the national importance of this venture and support it for the benefit of the country's agricultural development.
