MR regime borrowed more than all other govt’s did - PM

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Tuesday said the loans obtained by the previous government was higher than what former governments had taken for the last 60 years.

The Prime Minister said a solution would be brought to the Mattala Airport issue this year, and a new entry point to the Southern Express way would be constructed in Millaniya.
He said the government has taken many steps to fast track development. “The industrial zones being constructed in many parts of the country will help improve economy,” he said
