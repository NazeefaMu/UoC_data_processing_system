Rejuvenating a dying craft
It’s reed indeed!

Picking patterns and colours by visualizing the creation is really a moment of pleasure for Chandani. It gives her a sense of calmness and peacefulness. And she does not hesitate to call it meditation.
This lady belongs to the generation of craftspeople blessed with creative minds and well adapted fingers to weave precise patterns of the traditional reed mat. Pan Padura - as it is popularly known in Sri Lanka - is on the verge of extinction with the ceasing number of skilled craftsmen.
But Chandrani Padmalatha tries to buck the trend. Hailing from Kosgoda, Chandrani claims to have been weaving mats for the past 10 years. It has been her hobby. It has been her leisure.
“Sadly the present generation goes for instant things. They have no idea on how things were done in the past. Modern technology has badly affected the traditional artistic,” Padmalatha observed.
She produces wall hangings, hand bags, table mats, purses and pencil cases out of Gal Laha Pan (Cyperus corymbosus) and supplies them to hotels and Laksala outlets. Even when she wants a little rest, she turns to weaving for a while.
“Then I feel refreshed,” said Chandrani, “because creating things with fingers is an age-old tradition and will never fade away. Whether it is pottery, metalworking, lacquer working, lace making, handloom textiles, cane works, jewelry, woodworking or any of the many other forms of arts and crafts, it fills me with a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment.”
Achala Tharangi, a 26 year old from Bentota area, works in Wetake Training Centre in Bentota with 20 others. They manufacture various crafts from Wetake and Gal Laha Pan and supply them to Laksala and some private firms.
Traditional Pan Pedura is one of the greatest artworks of our traditional craftspeople and the conservation of past practices and traditions in the process offers us an idea of where they have come from, and how far they have reached.
Crafts For Centuries, Dumbara valley of the Kandy district has been famous for its production of mats with Distinctive design and colour schemes.
Since ancient, mat weaving used to be practised by rural women at home and Pan Pedura was considered a necessary domestic accomplishment and was used to sleep, share meals and so on.
Old Sinhalese verses hint as to how our village women were engaged in weaving mats.

Traditionally, groups of women would go to the paddy fields, river banks and marshes to harvest the reeds. They would then cut the reeds with a catty. Dried reeds are cleaned and tied into bundles and boiled with dye and dried in the shade. They use reeds of the same length for their weavings. Pan paduru are woven by hand, by keeping it on the floor.
During the ancient time rural villagers were used materials such as slender reeds of the Havan Pan, Gal Laha Pan, Thun-hiriya , Gatapan, Wetakeyya and Pothukola. They add various patterns to their mats. Nelum (lotus), namal (Na flowers), hansaputtuwa (intertwined swans), wankagiriya (mountains), lanugetaya (rope), lanuwa (plait), the swastika, and the mal gaha (flowering plant) are some of the most common designs used. They also use natural dyes obtained from plants such as patangi for red, venivel for yellow, katarolu for purple colour and bulu for black colour black.
Today, pan paduru has advanced away from its beginnings to become a cottage industry practiced by males and females. Pan is woven into more than matting, in items such as bags, wall hangings and table mats.

Weaving has become a dying craft now due to the lack of interest that younger generations have in the craft of their forefathers. The most talented workers are retiring, and the young people are not drawn to this field, according to Pubudu Rukmani, Training Instructor of Wetake Training Centre, Bentota (run under the purview of the National Crafts Council).
Assistant Secretary of the National Crafts Council Ananda Jayasinghe said that the government has taken various measures to uplift this dying industry by attracting more young trainee craftsmen for handicrafts training programmes conducted at island wide training centres of the Crafts Council.
“The main objective of conducting training programme is to attract more and more youth to the industry. Our training programmes start every January. The Crafts Council also provides a monthly allowance of Rs.1000 for each trainee during the first six months of the training programme. After a six-month training, they will be able to earn a good income by selling their crafts,” he said.
At present the National Crafts Council has 120 training centres across the island. Our training programmes are conducted by using raw materials found commonly in the area.
For an example, our Training Centre in Bentota conduct weaving programmes by using Wetake and Gal Laha Pan which can be easily found from their immediate environment. So craftsmen who train under this training centre can find raw materials for their products at a low cost or even free of charge. So there will be no production cost added to their products.
“Since craftsmen invent new designs and products, the demand for this industry will never decrease. So the modern mat-weaving craftsmen, to keep up with contemporary requirements, have introduced innovations in producing hand bags, purses, table mats, etc,” he said.
