SLFP will fall to fourth place in isolation - Prasanna Ranatunge

The SLFP will be relegated to the fourth place if it decides to go alone at the forthcoming local council election.
The UPFA should contest the election by forming a Common Opposition, said Joint Opposition Convener and Parliamentarian Prasanna Ranatunge.
Ranatunge said if the SLFP does not come forward to defeat the UNP at the local council election, his group will be compelled to take some other option.
He said the JVP acts according to the UNP's agenda. The JVP is talking about the Avant Garde issue by being silent on the Central Bank Bond issue which was its major issue at the time of election.
The JVP and the TNA are concerned only about their common objectives while keeping mum about common problems facing the country. The economic policy statement made in Parliament by the Prime Minister hinted that the government is mulling a privatisation exercise. The government is also trying to amalgamate the EPF and the ETF. When the former government tried to do it, they created a major uproar against it, he said. The government has failed to add the Rs. 10,000 allowance to the basic salary of public servants, Ranatunge said.
