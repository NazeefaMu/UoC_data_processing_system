Irish fail to put into practice homework on Prasanna

DUBLIN: John Bracewell, the Ireland coach, voiced his disappointment after his side’s shoddy bowling display in the 136-run loss to Sri Lanka in the second One-Day International on Saturday. He now hopes his side can bounce back quickly and react better when put under pressure in the future.
“The lesson is we need to react immediately,” Bracewell said. “Perhaps we are playing in a more traditional style, as in we’ll see how things go and then we’ll react to the scouting notes if put under pressure or things don’t go well.”
The coach was particularly not pleased with his bowlers failing to make use of the adequate information provided on Seekkuge Prasanna’s strengths. Prasanna scored a 46-ball 95 and put on 161 for the second wicket with centurion Kusal Perera to help Sri Lanka post 377 in their 50 overs.
“They played smarter than us and we need to smarten up,” he said. “To go and explore a guy (Prasanna) when we’ve got the notes is, in my opinion, a little bit unforgivable. We had good notes on him, and our notes showed that he could hit exactly where he did, and we were slow to react. And by the time we did react, seven overs were gone and 100 runs were added - and that cost us any chance of winning the match.
“We had to drag him away from his arc: he likes the ball in close and he hits through it. Our notes said slower balls and yorkers wide - as it turned out he dragged on a wide yorker. It took us a while to make that adjustment. You have to then assess whether that’s arrogance, or ignorance or stubbornness.”
Some of the Irish players arrived late for the series due to their county commitments but Bracewell didn’t want to use that as an excuse. He also took a potshot at his players claiming none of them approached the analysts present in the coaching staff in order to get information on the opposition. He now hopes that it won’t be repeated for his side’s next assignment against Afghanistan.
“You’ve got to do your homework.” he said. “When you get that information you’ve got to start doing your own research, you’ve got to watch what’s going on in the modern game, rather than just living in your own little world and thinking you can rock up. That is something we’ve got to learn. Guys have got to do their own preparation. We’ve got stats guys - they know their email address. They could have asked ‘Can you send me some stuff on Mathews?’ How many of them did? None of them. It’s something they need to wake up to. It’ll disappoint me if they haven’t done it for Afghanistan and they’ve had that shot across their belt.”
