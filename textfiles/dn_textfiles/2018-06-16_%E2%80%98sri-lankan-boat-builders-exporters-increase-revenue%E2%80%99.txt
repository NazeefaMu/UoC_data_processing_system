‘Sri Lankan boat builders, exporters increase revenue’

“Global ship and boat building industry has slowed down with less and less demand due to global economic pressures, but Sri Lankan boat builders and exporters have shown resilience and even increased export revenues,” Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen said.

“This Show will be the first ever marine festival in Sri Lanka organised to showcase the country’s capabilities in marine tourism recreational boating and yachting boat building and related services for export and local markets, ”Minister Bathiudeen said.
“It will provide ample opportunities to network shop connect and get in to know among the best of the Marine Industry of the region. The National Export Strategy (NES) of the Export Development Board with technical assistance of the International Trade Center Geneva has included the boat and ship building sector as one of the priority sectors to be actively promoted in the export strategy,” the Minister said.
