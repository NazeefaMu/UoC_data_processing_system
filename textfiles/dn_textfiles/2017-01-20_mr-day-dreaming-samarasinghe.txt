MR day dreaming: Samarasinghe

Toppling this government this year is only a dream, Skills Development and Vocational Training Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said.
He said the government is stable and the former President was defeated due to his flaws.
Samarasinghe made this observation in response to a question by journalists on a statement by the former President in Nugegoda that he would topple this government this year.
Plantation Industries Minister Lakshman Seneviratne and Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Deputy Minister Arundika Fernando also participated at the press conference held at the Sri Lanka Freedom Party auditorium yesterday.
