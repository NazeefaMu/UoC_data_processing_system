Vehicle market rebounds

The vehicle market experienced a rebound in May from a slow April due to the extensive New Year holiday. However on most categories demand remained weak due to high taxes, restrictions on LTV and high interest rates.
According to J. B. Securities survey, motor car registrations were 2,811 units in May up from 2,632 in April but significantly down from 3,664 units 12 months ago. Brand new car registrations recorded 981 units in May up from 885 units in April but significantly lower than 1,767 units 12 months ago. Small cars make up 94% of the category.
