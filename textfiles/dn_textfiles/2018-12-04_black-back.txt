BLACK IS BACK!

Colombo’s fashion elite, VIPs and prominent personalities from business, industry and high society thronged to be the first to witness design visionary Fouzul Hameed’s eagerly-awaited ‘Concept 2019’ Fashion Show. Held on November 24 at the Envoy Mansion, the high adrenaline fashion show was a sensory extravaganza as one after another, models took to the ramp, rocking stylish clothing from Fouzul Hameed’s 2019 collection, presented under the theme ‘Black’.
The riveting fashion show was stylishly directed and featured Sri Lanka’s top male models setting the ramp on fire with the eye-catching menswear collection.
Hameed continues to uplift menswear fashion in Sri Lanka and every year, his shows have an added element of attraction to raise the bar for the audience. The fashion show drew appreciation for the smart wedding collection for men. Leading up to this sixth edition of the fashion show, a social media campaign invited prospective grooms to enter a competition where the selected lucky winners was privileged to participate for the concept black 2019.
The models showcased silhouettes in black and bold colours for formal and occasion wear. Judging by the collection on display, it was evident that Hameed wanted to diversify and innovate looks for men to stand out from the crowd at Ceremonial, Western Wedding, National, Indian, Beachwear and Home Coming occasions in trendy and fashionable designs.
Commenting on the resounding success of Concept 2019, an exuberant Hameed remarked, “Unveiling a new collection is always a stressful job, but the joy and appreciation of the audience more than makes up for the hard work leading up to the fashion show! I am humbled by the appreciation shown by the audience at this year’s Concept 2019. The theme for this year, ‘Black’ was a challenging one, because the designs had to exude style and a sharp silhouette without becoming monotonous. I have also unveiled an inspired wedding collection for men, which reflects new style ideas for grooms to make an impression on their wedding day.”
