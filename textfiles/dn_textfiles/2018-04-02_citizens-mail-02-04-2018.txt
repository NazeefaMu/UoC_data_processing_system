A pinch of wisdom for Vesak
Vesak is a religious and cultural festival to commemorate the birth, enlightenment and Parinibbana of the Buddha which have happened on the same day.
According to a newspaper report, the Buddha Sasana Ministry will stop organisers of Vesak pandals from lighting the pandals on Vesak Poya day. They execute this to encourage young people in spending more time in temples. They want people to go and see Vesak pandals on the day after Vesak Poya.
I wonder if we can agree with well-grounded proposals. This tradition, though seemingly ridiculous, has weathered centuries in Buddhist countries. In reality, the Buddha’s teachings do not count in as a religion or any other dogma. That said, the followers do not abide by strict rules. The teachings have offered freedom.
On Vesak Day, the people organise many religious activities such as dansal, sil programmes and sermons. The people also prepare Vesak pandals and lanterns, and they illuminate them at the night.
On this day, many temples are filled with sil devotees and pilgrims. Many Buddhists refrain from eating meat and fish during this week and lead a vegetarian life.
Buddhism is a path of practice and spiritual development leading to insight into the true nature of reality. The Buddhist practices like meditation are means of changing yourself in order to develop the qualities, awareness, kindness and wisdom.
The experience developed within the Buddhist traditions over thousands of years has created an incomparable resource for all those who wish to follow a path which ultimately culminates in Enlightenment or liberation. An enlightened being seen the nature of reality absolutely clearly, just as it is, and lives fully and naturally in accordance with that vision. This is the goal of the Buddhist spiritual life, representing the end of suffering for anyone who attains it.
The basic tenets of Buddhist teachings are straightforward and practical: nothing is fixed or permanent; actions have consequences; change is possible.
Buddhism addresses itself to all people irrespective of race, nationality, cast, sexuality or gender.
It teaches practical methods which enable people to release and use its teachings in order to transform from their experience to be fully responsible for their lives. Buddhism teaches people how to end their suffering by cutting out greed, hatred and ignorance.
