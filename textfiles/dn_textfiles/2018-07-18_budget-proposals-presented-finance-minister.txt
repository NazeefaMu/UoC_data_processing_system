Early Childhood Development Project
Budget proposals presented to Finance Minister

Early childhood-centric budget proposals were presented to Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera during an Early Childhood Development (ECD) Project meeting that was held recently.
The event was organised to mark this year's Policymakers' Day that fell within the National Early Childhood Care Week and was held under the theme Building Brains, Building Futures.
Investing in health, nutrition, education and protection from birth through age five—known as Early Childhood Development—enables all children to reach their full brain capacity and is one of the most effective and proven drivers of sustainable economic growth.
The said proposals were presented by the Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, Women and Child Affairs and Education Ministries.
United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Representative for Sri Lanka Tim Sutton said, “The proposals presented today have the power to transform the lives of children and drive Sri Lanka’s economic growth. This investment is one of the most cost-effective ways to build this country’s human capital, with a return on investment of as much as 13.7 percent. We urge the Government of Sri Lanka and members of Parliament to support this call for national budget investment in early childhood, to ensure that every child in the country reaches their full potential.”
The event was attended by Oxford University Human Development Professor Prof. Edward Melhuish and UNICEF Regional Director for South Asia Jean Gough, among other parliamentarians, ministry officials and members of the diplomatic corps.
The meeting was organised by the National Planning Department and supported by UNICEF, in partnership with the Finance and Mass Media, National Policies and Economic Affairs, Education, Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, and Women and Child Affairs Ministries, as well as the Parliamentary Caucus for Children and the World Bank.
Building Brains, Building Futures, follows a series of sectoral consultations on health, education and child protection that were held to identify new and additional investment priorities and budget requests for ECD that the government could provide through its National Budget for 2019. In November, 2017, UNICEF, together with Sri Lanka’s Parliamentary Caucus for Children, organised a Parliamentary Forum on Early Childhood Development (ECD).
The forum, led by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and representatives from ministries, underlined the importance of committing to increased investments, leadership, coordination, programme integration, policy coherence and promoting a continuum of integrated ECD services.
