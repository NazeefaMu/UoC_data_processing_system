Museum of stuffed gophers

A small town overrun by gophers has turned the infestation into a top tourist attraction - by stuffing the rodents and putting them centre stage in a bizarre museum.
The Gopher Hole Museum, in Torrington, Canada, has 47 different exhibitions showing the furry animals mocked up in all sorts of surreal situations celebrating the town's history and events.
The strange displays were the brainchild of one of the residents who wanted to boost the tiny hamlet's failing economy while simultaneousness solving the problem of a plague of gophers.
After a government grant and 18 years, the museum boasts over 70 stuffed minute mammals, attracting thousands of visitors each year.
There are gophers dressed up as train inspectors, native Indians, firemen, ice hockey players, gas attendants, blacksmiths, fishermen, hairdressers and even a bank robber.
Photographer and blogger, Raymond Walsh witnessed the curious exhibition, and shared the bizarre pictures on his website Man On The Lam.
“My favourite was the campground scene - it's tough to beat a dead gopher in a bikini,” said 44-year-old Raymond, who now lives in Muscat, Oman.
“Most people who I've shown the pictures to think they're cute, in a macabre kind of way. There have been a couple of folks who think it's disgusting, but for the most part the reaction is pretty positive.'
After town elders floated the idea in 1996, Canadian officials granted the money to build the small structure and have attracted around 6000 tourists per annum ever since.
And they didn't stop with the museum, all 11 fire hydrants in the town are painted to resemble Gophers and a 12ft high Gopher sculpture can also be found.
With high street shops closing down, British towns facing rat infestations may want to take note.
