Malta’s famous Azure Window rock formation collapses

A beautiful rock arch once featured as a backdrop in Game of Thrones has collapsed into the sea.
In a bid to prevent its erosion, the country had introduced fines of over £1000 for anyone caught walking across the bridge. But it was not enough to save it and it crumbled into the sea while large waves lashed it today.
It had been one of the main attractions on the island of Gozo, pictured in thousands of photo albums from tourists who visited. Malta Prime Minister Joseph Muscat described his ‘heartbreaking’ sadness at the loss. No one was injured.
Geologist Peter Gatt said the limestone pillar supporting the arch gave way. He attributed the collapse to years of erosion to currents beneath the waves and rough seas.
The window also served as a backdrop in the 1981 movie ‘Clash of the Titans.’
