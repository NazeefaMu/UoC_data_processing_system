Great potential for Israel, SL relations

Interview with Israel Ambassador to India and Sri Lanka Daniel Carmon:
Israel Ambassador to India and Sri Lanka Daniel Carmon is on a three day visit to Sri Lanka to work on a few initiatives to improve bilateral relations between the two countries. In an interview with the Daily News, the Ambassador spoke on the potential to do many things that are important for both countries.
Ambassador Carmon has served in the diplomatic field for 44 years and was appointed as an Ambassador to India and Sri Lanka in 2014.
The following are excerpts of the interview:
Q: What is the purpose of your visit to Sri Lanka?
A: This is my seventh visit to Sri Lanka in two and a half years, due to the fact that we don't have a residence embassy. The aim of our mission is to put content which would suit both Sri Lanka and Israel. Bilateral relations between the countries has been improving dramatically for many years.
I visit Sri Lanka with my colleagues in Delhi for three to four days. We meet as many people as we can. We also have discussions with the government officials, ministries and ministers.
Q: How do you see the relationship between Sri Lanka and Israel?
A: In the last few decades, we have seen ups and downs. There were times when we had resident diplomatic missions here in Sri Lanka. We had less than better times in the past but I think last few years we are in the upswing enjoying a very good relations.
There is potential to do many activities together that are important for both countries. Those areas are always on the discussion table between us and our counterparts in the Ministries. We are looking for right partners and possible areas that we can work together.
In Israel, the private sector is something that we encourage very much. Private sector is showing more greater interest in upgrading its connectivity. There are many initiatives by companies and individuals.
There are many Israeli businessmen who are very active in Sri Lanka. But, I see a lot of enthusiasm
growing for Israeli’s to do business in Sri Lanka.
Q: What are the initiatives taken to improve bilateral relations?
A: We have taken a few initiatives in the field of agriculture which are very important to Sri Lanka. We have the expertise and knowledge and we are ready to share it with the Sri Lankan government. We will push and promote as much as we can. Another important area which we have seen more interest from Israeli citizens is tourism.
We hear that increasing numbers of Israeli tourists are visiting Sri Lanka. It has become a very popular destination for Israeli tourists. Sri Lanka is definitely on the map for Israeli tourists.
The economic situation in Israel allows Israelis to spend one or two vacations abroad.
This is something that both governments should encourage. Bilateral relations in diplomacy are not confined only to talk about high politics but also to promote people to people connections and development projects whilst encouraging the areas of mutual concern between the two parties.
Despite the fact that we are not present here by permanent basis, we are trying to do it from Delhi. Potential is much greater than what we are doing now.
Q: Why is there no embassy on a permanent basis in Sri Lanka?
A: There were various political reasons for not having an embassy on a permanent basis. We had some issues but they are now in the past. The decision to open a diplomatic mission has also to do with budget and technicalities. I believe that some conditions that needs to be done within Israel would be met. On two different occasions, we had the diplomatic missions in Sri Lanka. At this stage we have no plans to
establish an embassy on a permanent basis but it has got nothing to do with Sri Lanka. For various reasons,
the numbers of Israeli missions were smaller during the last few years. We have closed some missions
worldwide as well.
I think we can also work well together even without a residence embassy. But, we only have to find the right partners, we have to define and identify the areas of mutual concern and interest.
Q: What are the areas of interest for both countries?
A: Israel is not investing compared to other countries. We are not bringing bigger investments to the table.
Even Israeli private companies are not investing abroad. What we bring is technology, knowledge and
experience. We built a nation from scratch, and we had to deal with food security, water scarcity as the majority of our territory is a desert, but with all these challenges we built our nation. Thousands of Sri Lankans have been to Israel for training in our laboratories. These activities might not be big in magnitude, but we talk about individual and group training. Training was held in the field of agriculture, health, water management, regional planning and food security.
Majority of the Sri Lankans work in Israel as care givers and in the agricultural sector. It’s a win win situation for both countries. We know how important it is for the Sri Lankan community as well as economy.
There is a community of Sri Lankan workers in Israel. I think we should promote this more. A little more than an year ago, we started a pilot project. Earlier it was in the hands of private entrepreneurs.
Now we have started a government to government project. The Ministry of Foreign Employment is functioning well, I think.
We have signed an agreement with them on a joint pilot project with periodical agricultural workers.Things between the two governments are going well.
Q: Any plans to improve the trade relationship between the two countries?
A: Not for now, but we are on the verge of renewing two intergovernmental mechanisms. One is political dialogue between the two foreign ministries. A joint economic committee is set to meet in the foreseeable future.
Q: How do you see American President Donald Trump’s visit to the Middle East?
A: The speech that President Trump made in Saudi Arabia was very important, his views and thoughts on
encouraging the Arab world to counter terrorism and drive terrorism out. His whole trip has a very great significance. But, with regard to Israel, the Palestinian political process will have to wait to see the result of the visit. However, still there is hope that the stalled process will advance because the region needs better times.
President Trump sent an important message concerning Iran as well. Iran does not only threaten Saudi and
the Gulf states, it also threatens Israel. I think the President's message was well received.
Q: President Trump also asked Israel to hold back on settlement building on the West Bank. Your opinion on that?
A: We have to wait and see what was said, we are not only talking about the speeches. We will see what the after visit effect is and where will we go from now.
Q: The peace discussions with Israel and Palestine authorities have been stalled since 2014. How do you see this coming?
A: There are many channels of discussions between us and the Palestinian authority. Some of which has to do with civilian affairs and many things are happening on those grounds. A week ago, an important Israel and Palestine committee met to discuss many issues. The political discussion of course was halted. Rather than trying to look back and finding who is at fault, I think we all should give a chance to President Trump’s visit.
We all look at President Trump’s visit in a very positive way. It was a visit of a true friend and we have
very good relations with the US in all aspects.
Q: President Trump said all Muslim countries should come together and combat terrorism. Do you see this possibility?
A: The issue of terrorism is something that each country has to confront by itself, but it’s not enough. Countries should unite whilst improving the efforts, mechanisms and coordination between them.
Coordination and cooperation is super important between nations. President Trump also clearly explained that the tragedy was that the majority of the victims of Islamic terrorism were Muslims.
Q: Do you think Israel has good connection between Muslim countries?
A: I am sure that the old equation of Arab or Muslims on one side and Jews or Israel on the other side has changed and it is no longer what it used to be. Things have changed because the challenges also have changed. We have attained peace treaties with two major Arab countries, Egypt and Jordan. We have similar interests between Israel and some other Muslim countries which traditionally were on the other side. Their challenges are very similar to ours, definitely the fight against terrorism. We have a long way to go though.
Now the world and the region have changed, we have to look for common interest to bring peace, security and prosperity as President Trump said, we all can contribute to that, but the paradigm of what used to be has changed. One has to be only hopeful in this regard. It has changed and affected the international politics which is changing its nature also. We are not only talking about the traditional international relations but we are putting more content which is very important to all. Though I am not a resident Ambassador, I am trying to coordinate with my colleagues and counterparts to promote a web of relations that would support Sri Lanka as well as Israel’s economy.
