Ranjan and Anuruddha lock horns over sand mining in Divulapitiya
Pandemonium ruled in Parliament yesterday when Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake and Gampaha District Joint Opposition Parliamentarian Indika Anuruddha locked their horns over sand mining in Divulapitiya and a letter issued allegedly by the Deputy Minister.
The tense situation erupted when Social Empowerment and Welfare Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake rose to answer an oral question raised by MP Anuruddha with regard to a sand mining issue in Divulapitiya. The question had been directed to the Land Minister. The Deputy Minister began to answer by speaking of destruction in Divulapitiya by way of sand mining.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya directed Chief Government Whip Gayantha Karunathilake to answer the question observing that Deputy Minister Ramanayake would be given time to make a statement on his issue.
However, things got worse when Indika Anuruddha tabled a letter issued allegedly by Deputy Minister Ramanayake that requested to grant permission to run a business of metal quarry to his supporters to provide granite needed for the Colombo Port City project. Anurudda said Ramanayake had asked permission through a letter for his supporters to run a metal quarry and their names were in the annexed list.
Anurudda urged Ramanayake to make a statement as to whether he had issued such a letter or not.
When Deputy Minister Ramanayake was allowed to make an explanation, he said Anuruddha and his family engaged in ilegal sand mining in Gampaha.
He said Divulapitiya area is subjected to destruction because of ilegal sand mining. Opposition member Ranjith Soyza said Deputy Minister Ramanayake used unparliamentary language. Speaker Jayasuriya said they would be expunged.
Deputy Minister Ramanayake said the country knew that he did not do any such illegal activity. But Anuruddha engaged in illegal activities, he said.
Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera joined the cross talk and said the document which was tabled by Anuruddha should be sent to the Government Analyst since Ramanayake has denied placing his signature to it.
The Speaker said he read the letter. It was a request letter to Minister Kabir Hashim to allow an access road to a metal quarry and not a request of permission to run a metal quarry, he said.
Responding to the Speaker, MP Anuruddha demanded to read the letter.
"I know the letters. I can read it," The Speaker said. "You cant order the Chair", he said.
The argument arose again for a second time when Opposition Member Padma Udayashantha Gunasekera during his supplementary questions asked Social Welfare Minister S. B. Dissanayake of the government's stance on the Divulapitiya issue.
Minister Dissnayake said the question had nothing to do with the original question. He asked MP Gunasekara to learn to raise oral questions in the proper manner. Minister Dissnayake too was heard using unparliamentary language when Gunasekara urged him to answer his question.
Police report on Malabe shooting incident will be presented to Parliament: PM
A police report on the investigations into the shooting incident at Malabe targeting SAITM CEO Dr. Sameera Senanayake will be presented to Parliament, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister was replying to a question raised by Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake in Parliament yesterday.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said he would inquire into the progress of the investigations, adding that he would look into the possibility of obtaining the police report within this week itself. “We are still unaware as to what led to the shooting incident,” he said.
MP Dissanayake urged the Prime Minister to produce a comprehensive report on the incident to Parliament, observing that various interpretations over the incident could further confuse the issue.
Meanwhile, a question raised by MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena over the court ruling on the medical degree holders of the SAITM and students’ protests against it, led to a heated argument between the government and Opposition members.
MP Gunawardena questioned as to why the government resorted to fire tear gas and water cannons at the university students who were peacefully demonstrating against the SAITM.
He demanded the government to release IUSF Convenor Lahiru Weerasekara and other students who were arrested during the protests.
Higher Education Minister and Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella replying to these concerns said Parliament could not reverse an order given by the court. “Whether we like it or not, we are bound to accept it. You cannot change the ruling by getting the students onto streets to protest. If you do not agree with the ruling, you can appeal against it.
The students were arrested because they violated a court order during their protests,” he said.
Kiriella, reminding that the former government led by Mahinda Rajapaksa was responsible for the inception of the SAITM issue, stated that Prof. Carlo Fonseka was appointed the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) during the previous regime because he was willing to give his consent to the SAITM. “The former government facilitated Rs. 600 million to build that hospital,” he said.
However, UPFA MP Dr. Ramesh Pathirana contradicted the Minister’s statement and said Prof. Carlo Fonseka never gave his consent to the SAITM. UPFA member Bandula Gunawardena said the former government didn't offer Rs. 600 million to the SAITM, but it was a loan obtained from the People’s Bank.
NFF Leader Wimal Weerawansa said the SAITM issue had been aggravated because the graduates passing out from medical faculties of state universities and those passing out from the SAITM were given the same recognition.
“If you make Act 16 (Examination for Registration to Practice Medicine in Sri Lanka) compulsory for SAITM students, you can resolve the problem to some extent,” he said.
MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake commenting on the court case on the SAITM issue said both the plaintiff and the respondent of the case were on the same page on the issue, and therefore it was not acceptable.
He said the court had been used for a hypocritical motive at this instance. He said the Health Minister deferred acting against the SAITM because his son’s wife was a student in it.
Speaker asks MPs to mind their language
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya making an announcement over live telecast of Parliamentary proceedings requested all Parliamentarians to be mindful of their conduct and language in Parliament and set an example by themselves to the country as otherwise people would lose their faith in parliamentary democracy. He requested them to refrain from slinging mud at each other and not to resort to unparliamentary language during Parliamentary debates.
“Since November 21, 2016, live telecast of parliamentary sessions started. We have introduced high definition TV technology. Parliamentary sessions are aired live through Channel 91 of Peo TV. With effect from today (7), sessions would be aired in all three languages. People can watch parliament sessions and listen to them in Sinhala, Tamil or English.
Latest developments can help MPs to set an example themselves and behave in parliament in accordance with dignity and decorum of the institution. If MPs continue to sling mud at each other and resort to unparliamentary language, that would result in public losing their trust in the parliamentary system,” the Speaker said.
Speaker advises Mustapha to look into alleged financial irregularities of Uva PC
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday advised Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Mustapha to look into the alleged financial irregularities of the Uva Provincial Council.
The Speaker made this instruction when allegations of financial misappropriations of the Uva Chief Minister were brought to the attention of Parliament again by UNP MP Chaminda Wijesiri and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday.
Minister Mustapha replying to the queries raised by the MPs insisted that he was not empowered to take disciplinary action against the Chief Minister as it was a devolved power as of the 13th Amendment. “I have limited power and I cannot interfere into the work of provincial councils,” he said. However, the Speaker maintained that Mustapha should not shirk his responsibility as the subject minister and should take steps to ascertain whether such financial irregularities had taken place. “These are serious allegations.
If the Provincial Council had produced false information, you can ask the Governor to take action against that,” he told the minister. UNP MP Chaminda Wijesiri said the Uva Chief Minister had allegedly misappropriated Rs. 5.1 million in guise of a programme to distribute school bags to students. MP Anura Dissanayake said the public officials of the Uva Provincial Council had been subjected to harassment for exposing the shady deals in the council.
‘MR had spent Rs. 90.25 m on advisers and other officers’
National Policies and Economic Affairs State Minister Niroshan Perera yesterday revealed that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had spent Rs. 90.25 million as salaries to 196 advisers and other officers during his tenure.
He made this revelation in Parliament while responding to a question raised by Joint Opposition Parliamentarian Udaya Gammanpila on the advisors to President Maithripala Sirisena. According to the answer by State Minister, D. M. Jayaratne, W. J. S. Karunaratne, Wasantha Obeysekara, Gamini Sumanasekara have been appointed as advisors to the President, while there are no personal secretaries and only six coordinating secretaries.
Joint Opposition MP Gammanpila said according to the media, each district has a coordinating secretary to the President. He questioned if it were only a media show.
MP Gammanpila said he cannot accept the answer as there are a large number of advisors, including defeated MPs.
He said appointments of Shantha Bandara and Nishantha Warnasinghe were granted by President himself, but their names are not included in the answer.
