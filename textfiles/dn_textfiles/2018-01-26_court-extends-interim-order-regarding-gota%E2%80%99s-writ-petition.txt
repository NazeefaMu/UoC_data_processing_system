Court extends interim order regarding Gota’s writ petition

The Court of Appeal yesterday further extended until February 15 its interim order preventing police from acting against former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa under the Public Property Act regarding a Magistrate’s Court inquiry.
A two-Judge-bench comprising the then Court of Appeal (President) Justice Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Shiran Gunaratne extended this Interim Order preventing police from acting under the Public Property Act against Rajapaksa, on the Galle Magistrate’s Court inquiry over a complaint that the D.A. Rajapaksa Museum and Memorial in Medamulana was built using public funds amounting to Rs.90 million.
On November 29, 2017, the Interim Order was issued on the basis of an ex parte proceeding by a two-Judge-bench comprising the then Court of Appeal (President) Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya and Justice Shiran Gunaratne. This is pursuant to a writ petition filed by Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. President’s Counsel Romesh de Silva appearing for the petitioner commenced his oral submissions and it is to be resumed the next date as well.
Deputy Solicitor General Viraj Dayaratne, appearing for the Attorney General, informed court that he is expecting to make his oral submissions on the next date. The Court had upheld Rajapaksa’s version that the certificate issued under Section 8(1) of the offences against the Public Property Act is ultra vires or violates his legitimate expectations.
Rajapaksa cited IGP Pujith Jayasundara, CID Director Shani Abeysekara, FCID Director Ravi Waidyalankara and the Attorney General as respondents.
Rajapaksa also seeks an order in the nature of a writ of prohibition preventing the respondents from proceeding or relying upon the certificate filed under and in terms of Section 8(1) of the offences against the Public Property Act against him.
President’s Counsel Romesh de Silva with Ali Sabry PC, Counsel Sugath Caldera and Ruwantha Cooray under the instruction of Counsel Sanath Wijewardane appeared for Rajapaksa. Senior Deputy Solicitor General Viraj Dayaratne with Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake, Senior State Counsel Udara Karunatilleka and SSC Nirmalan Vigneshvaran appeared for the Attorney General.
