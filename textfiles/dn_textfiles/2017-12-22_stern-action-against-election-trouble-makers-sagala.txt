Stern action against election trouble makers - Sagala

The Sri Lanka Police will take maximum efforts to ensure a free and fair election, under instructions from the Chairman of the Elections Commission, Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka said.
Especially, we will take stern action against those stirring up communal and racial sentiments through false propaganda, seeking political mileage during the election period.
The Minister made these remarks while speaking to the media after handing over nominations for several Local Government bodies in the Matara district.
“This election will be a historic one. Therefore, we as a party, have decided to set an example to other political groups. We have already instructed our candidates to refrain from resorting to violence. With the intention of carrying out an environmental-friendly election campaign, we have also advised them not to use polythene for election propaganda. We also refrained from organising vehicle parades and other forms of processions during the nomination period,” the Minister said.
“We have utmost respect to election laws. At the same time, we want to urge activists and supporters of all political parties to protect their unity at the village level. We do not have to be divided because of an election. We will turn this election into an opportunity to strengthen unity among all political parties, at grassroots level,” the Minister added, stating that the unity government had ushered in a new political culture.
