Public should not panic over new Constitution: Hakeem

The public should not panic over the enactment of a new Constitution since the government or an individual cannot enact it alone, City Planning and Water Management Minister Rauf Hakeem said.
He made this observation responding to a question by a journalist with regard to the various disputes that arose among the Opposition Members of Parliament and the Buddhist clergy.
Minister Hakeem said most people have a fear of the enactment of a new Constitution. But the members of the Government will never support to bring a Constitution that would badly affect the country or its citizens.
The minister said Buddhism's foremost place won't be changed in the new Constitution. Parliament has the final authority to pass the Constitution. The President or the Prime Minister cannot do it alone, he said.
"We extend our support for a Constitution which the whole country can accept," he said.
