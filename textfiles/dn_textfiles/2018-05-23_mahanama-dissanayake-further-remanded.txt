Mahanama, Dissanayake further remanded

President’s former Chief of Staff, I. H. K. Mahanama and former State Timber Corporation (STC) Chairman P. Dissanayaka, who were in remand custody for allegedly accepting a bribe of Rs. 20 million, were further remanded until June 5 by the Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake.
State Counsel Sunethra Jayasinghe, Bribery Commission's Assistant Director General Asitha Anthony and OIC K.K. Premasiri appeared on behalf of the Bribery Commission. Bribery Commission officials submitted a further report to the Magistrate.
Assistant Director General Asitha Anthony pleaded permission to direct those phone call audio tapes to the Government Analyst to verify if the suspects had talked to the Indian businessman.
The investigation initiated said Mahanama had demanded a bribe of Rs. 540 million from an Indian investor who was ready to acquire a section of the Kantale sugar factory. Mahanama had been attending to this matter of settling the transaction some time ago while he was the Land Ministry Secretary.
However, the Indian investor had refused to pay the sum stating that it was high and demanded a reduction. Within several weeks, they allegedly had agreed to accept Rs 100 million.
The two were arrested at a Colombo city hotel car park on May 3, by the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption officers while accepting a bribe of Rs. 20 million.
ADG also pleaded from the Magistrate to direct those audio tapes to the Digital Forensics Unit of the Government Analyst's Department to check the audio clips.
The Counsel appearing for the suspects objected to the same plea. However the Magistrate observed that he would deliver an order on the matter on the next hearing day.
The case was fixed for June 5.
