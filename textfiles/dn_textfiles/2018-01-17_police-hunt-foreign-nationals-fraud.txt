Police hunt foreign nationals for fraud

Marawila Police launched a special investigation to arrest two foreign nationals who allegedly cheated Rs. 28,000 from an employee of a fuel station in the Katuneriya area in Marawila.  
According to Marawila Police, the two individuals had come to the particular fuel station, inquiring the price of a 5-kg gas cylinder from an employee. Subsequently, after requesting to have a glance at local notes, the individuals had fled the scene, stealing cash worth Rs. 28,000.  
After realizing that they had fled the scene with the money, the fuel station manager made a complaint at the Marawila Police station. After scrutinizing CCTV footage of the fuel station, police discovered that the suspects had escaped on a motorcycle.  
Further investigations revealed that the suspects had also stolen money from a textile shop in Chilaw, three months ago, with the same ruse.
