IE Singapore inks MoU on megapolis

 
International Enterprise (IE) Singapore signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Sri Lanka on Monday (July 18) to collaborate in the development of the country’s Western Region Megapolis.
This is the first MoU between Sri Lanka and a Singapore government agency, paving the way for stronger bilateral investment and economic partnerships, said IE Singapore.
Tan Soon Kim, assistant chief executive officer of IE Singapore, and Nihal Rupasinghe, Secretary to the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development (MoMWD) of Sri Lanka, signed the MoU at the Istana. The signing was witnessed by Singaporian Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who is on an official state visit there.
Sri Lanka’s Western Region is home to 5.8 million people or 29 percent of the population. The region is the main driver of Sri Lanka’s economy, contributing 40 percent of its total gross domestic product in 2014. The Sri Lankan government aims to triple the region’s per capita income to US$12,000 (S$16,200) by 2020, targeting an average annual growth rate of 7-8 per cent over the next 14 years.
The Western Region Megapolis is a flagship development which currently comprises 142 projects estimated at US$40 billion over the next 15 years.
Tan said, “Given its accelerated growth, the Western Region Megapolis is a good first stop for Singapore companies to consider when doing business in Sri Lanka. The MoU signed between IE Singapore and MoMWD creates a platform for Singapore and Sri Lankan companies to partner each other in the urban solutions and connectivity sectors.”
