We should build a country where schools opened and prisons closed – President

It is the responsibility of the people to build a country where schools opened and prisons closed, healthy people are living, while the number of hospitals are minimised, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
The President made these observations at a ceremony held on Wednesday to celebrate the 150th anniversary of St. Mary’s College in Kegalle.
He recalled the statement of Martin Luther King: “The greatest tragedy of this period of social transition was not the strident clamor of the bad people, but the appalling silence of the good people”. He said intellectuals and great personalities should be born more to suppress the strident clamor of the bad people, he said.
The President commended the mission by the St Mary’s College which has a renowned history, to produce effective citizens to the country. He said the college which has good influence of the Thripitaka, Bible and the Koran is exemplary for the reconciliation process.
The President opened the educational and trade exhibition held to mark the 150th anniversary.
St. Mary’s College is one of the oldest boys’ schools in Sri Lanka, having a history of nearly 150 years. It was established in 1867 adjacent to St. Mary’s Church as a vernacular English school and came under the direction of Benedictine Missionaries.
