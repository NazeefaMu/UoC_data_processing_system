Guidelines to conduct from the sidelines!

Everyone attends a sporting event hoping to enjoy the skills and dexterity displayed by the competitors as well as to have a good time. They take pleasure in appreciating the finer moves in the game and to witness the memorable moments of brilliance that often occur inside the arena.
Obviously, we all want to observe our favourite teams come out on top and encourage them with heartening cheers. Who doesn’t like going to a live sporting event? The anticipation, the crowd, and the frenzy of the sport all provide an indescribable thrill to the senses.
Regrettably, there are some people who attend a sporting event and are a disturbing influence on their fellow spectators while engaged in all kinds of rude and disorderly behaviour. Sporting events are a venue for fans to enjoy themselves, relax and have fun while cheering their favourite team. However, they should never become a setting for over-emotional morons to engage in reprehensible behaviour.
And remember to mind your language. There will inevitably be women and children around you. Going overboard and getting crudely and hysterically demonstrative is just not on. That is because such behaviour can spark confrontation and become downright dangerous.
No one has to remind you that mouthing obscenities in public is nothing short of being offensive. Even though the atmosphere may be charged with finger-biting tension there is no excuse for throwing things on to the field or yelling filthy invective at the opposing players or the umpires and referees.
Hurling objects on to the field of play is a criminal offence and can land you in jail. A free spirited air and loud celebratory spectator reaction permissible in certain sports such as soccer, rugby or cricket goes against the rules in many other competitive games which call for absolute silence. Crowds can influence a match by cheering their team on.
This helps create a carnival atmosphere in games such as cricket, rugby or soccer. Besides, it adds to the excitement as well and inspires the players
However, there are certain sports where extreme concentration is absolutely essential and obligatory. These include sporting events such as golf tourneys, tennis matches and billiards or snooker competitions where spectator silence is compulsory.
Be aware of the correct spectator appreciation at all times. For instance any form of distraction is frowned upon at tennis matches. Leaving your seat in the middle of a point can severely distract a player as well as those around you. Similarly, when returning to your seat you should either wait till a point is over or on the completion of a game. Some competitions will only allow you to leave your seat or return to it on the changeover of ends.
Never walk around the field while play is in progress. During a cricket match for instance you can impair the concentration and judgement of a batsman while strolling across the sightscreen. By doing so, through either ignorance or an uncaring attitude, can hold the game up interminably.
Worse still are the pitch invaders who love to call attention to themselves by disrupting the game while in progress. They are invariably apprehended by security and frogmarched out of the venue by security. And thank heavens there are no mad ‘streakers’ in this neck of the woods.
Always keep in mind that referees and umpires are only human and could err under excitement and pressure. Avoid being downright spiteful or rude if you disagree with a call or play. You can of course cheer until you are blue in the face when your team is ahead. But make sure your loudness does not disturb fellow spectators following the play.
Another sad aspect is when the emphasis on winning gets out of control particularly when over-enthusiastic parents become aggressive in their quest for their progeny being number one. Recent events have shown that parents have become increasingly hostile at youth sporting events. Parental pressure to perform better can cause devastating psychological damage to young minds.
Yes, parents are pushing their children too far when it comes to both team and individual sports. Mostly these fanatical fathers pressurise their children to perform for their own personal gratification rather than for the team or the player.
This certainly causes parents to become overly competitive and often aggressive in their attempts to win at any cost. In short, the kids are forced to play adult versions of games to satisfy an ‘adult’ thirst for experiencing what they watch on television.
Some of the most hilarious comedy cameos are witnessed from the sidelines and not in the arena where the action is taking place. It happens when some silly panjandrum offers his inexperienced tips to the players on how to make a winning play or move. Such inane actions often give people some comic relief from the seriousness of the game while the self-appointed coach is viewed as an attention-grabbing joker.
Remember there is good reason why you are in the stands and not on the playing field. No matter how inadequate a player or coach appears to be, in your estimation, he is a darn side better than you are. That is why he is in the thick of the action and you are in the stands. Consider that bad sportsmanship from the stands leaves a bad taste all round. This type of dreadful behaviour does nothing to glorify the event but rather serves to denigrate the sport and reduce the venue into an arena of infamy for the most shameful and embarrassing fan moments in sports history.
Never resort to horsing around or engaging in rough and tumble behaviour that could become obnoxious and may cause a violent reaction among those around you. Do not become a nuisance to others or cast rude remarks at opposing fans. If some idiot actually is spoiling for a fight ignore him. Never retaliate verbally or physically. If the intimidation continues and the guy does not back off simply call for security. And never trade punches with an opposing group of fans .To watch grown men fighting when their teams are in action amounts to nothing less than hooliganism and is certainly one of the saddest spectacles in any sport.
