Ganegala, acting CEB Chairman

Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya has appointed W.B. Ganegala as the Acting Chairman of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB). Ganegala is a senior public servant and former Ministry Secretary.
 Meanwhile, Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) Chairman Eng Anura Wijepala tendered his resignation yesterday, Power and Energy Ministry sources said. Sources said Wijepala handed over the resignation letter to Power and Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya.
The Ministry has recently taken a decision to bring the functions of the CEB’s internal audit division and legal division under its General Manager. These divisions previously functioned independently under the CEB Chairman. Wijepala’s resignation comes in the wake of this decision.
Sources said the resignation letter had mentioned a future date.
