‘Jeep drivers create unfortunate situation in Yala’

Hotelier and wild life conservationist Srilal Miththapala says that due to the irresponsible behavior of visitors and errant jeep drivers to the Yala National Park, an unfortunate situation is being created.
The deteriorating situation at Yala is reaching unbelievable levels, with the Department of Wild Life Conservation (DWC) being unable and powerless to bring to book those who are a law unto themselves.
“The only way to get some action is to bring enormous pressure and public opinion against the 'higher ups'," he said.
“We have ruined the poor elephant called Gemunu at Yala by allowing jeep drivers to entice him with food, and very soon there will be disaster, and the elephant will be blamed. Now safari operators are encouraging the bears also and feeding them.”
He said that in most cases the registration number plate of the offenders is clearly visible and the authorities should follow up on social media and take action against these persons.
He said that on several occasions he has personally brought this up with authorities to no avail. “We have spoken to the DWC but they are afraid to act,” he said.
