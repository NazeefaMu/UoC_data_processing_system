Four fishery harbours in the pipeline for development

Sri Lanka Navy Hydrographic Service, on a request made by Fisheries Ministry and Aquatic Resources Development has completed bathymetric surveys in support of developing four fishery harbours in the North and North East of Sri Lanka.
Accordingly, the final report was handed over to the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera by Chief Hydrographer of the Navy, Rear Admiral Sisira Jayakody during a function held recently.
Fishery harbour development project was an initiative of Minister Amaraweera and under that, seven sites were identified in the North and North East by the Ministry for development. Incidentally, SLNHS was tasked to conduct hydrographic surveys in four sites out of them. Accordingly, SLNHS conducted surveys in Munai anchorage of Point Pedro harbour, Sakkodai anchorage, Thalaithurai anchorage of Delft harbour and Pesalai harbor, the Navy media unit said. It was estimated that Rs. 10 million was the total cost for the surveys and under the guidance of the Navy Commander Vice Admiral Sirimevan Ranasinghe, the SLNHS has completed the task free of charge, saving a large amount of funds to the government coffers.
Minister Amaraweera thanked Sri Lanka Navy for its efforts in completing the surveys within a very short period of time. Also, the Minister appreciated the progress achieved by SLNHS after opening its Naval Wing of National Hydrographic Office at NARA in October 2017 and assured his continues support for its future operations.
Secretary to the MFARD Jagath Wijeweera, Chairman NARA Dr. Anil Premarathne, Senior officials from SLNHS and officials from the Sri Lanka Fishery Harbour Cooperation were also present at the occasion.
