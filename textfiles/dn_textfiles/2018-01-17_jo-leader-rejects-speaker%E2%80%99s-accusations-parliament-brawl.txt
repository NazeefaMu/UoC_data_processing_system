JO leader rejects Speaker’s accusations on Parliament brawl

Joint Opposition Leader MP Dinesh Gunawardena yesterday rejected claims made by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya that he and his coalition were responsible for the brawl in Parliament on January 10.
Releasing a statement on twitter, Gunawardena said, “It is sad that the Speaker, as usual, continues to blame the JO and myself, when the entire country saw what happened on live telecast.”
Speaker Jayasuriya, in a statement, said he had been notified by Parliament security that a group of MPs had planned in advance to carry out a protest.
As Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe delivered his statement, the members of the Joint Opposition invaded the Well of the House and ended up clashing with UNP parliamentarians. The Speaker has promised to investigate into CCTV footage of the incident and take action when Parliament meets next on January 23.
