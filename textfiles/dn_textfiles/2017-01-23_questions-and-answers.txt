Wife's entitlements of a null and void marriage
Question
I got married 30 years ago. It is not a successful marriage. I requested my wife to get divorced. But she refused. We didn’t have any marital relationship and my wife didn’t fulfill her duties as a wife. However, I married another woman secretly without divorcing my first wife. My children are married and my first wife is staying with them. I don’t have children from my second wife. I didn’t transfer my properties to anyone. Is my second wife entitled to the said property?
Kariyawasam, Dehiwala
Answer
You can transfer your properties to whoever you want. However you have married your second wife without divorcing your first wife legally. It is a criminal offence according to the Penal Code (Bigamy). If you die without transferring your property then your first wife is entitled to half share of your property. The children of your first marriage are entitled to the other half. Your second wife is not entitled to your property as the second marriage is null and void.

Gunadasa, Divulgane

Under the provisions of the State Land Ordinance you can’t sell your land as you are having only a permit. Even if the land is a state land, you need the approval of the Divisional Secretary subject to the conditions in the state grant. If you transfer the property excluding the condition the state can acquire the property.
