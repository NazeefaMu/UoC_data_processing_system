Sri Lanka’s cricket hits a rough patch

Cricket which is the nation’s pride has certainly hit a rough patch or so to say in cricketing parlance when a batsman is out of form, where the sport is riding a storm and trying to extract itself from the rough seas that are battering it from all corners.
Notwithstanding the troubled times Sri Lanka Cricket is currently going through with a court injunction that has prevented the annual elections from being held as scheduled on May 31 and thereby brought the administration under a government appointed Competent Authority coming under the Minister of Sport, came the refusal of former cricketing legends to lend a hand to Sri Lanka cricket as consultants. To top it all comes the icing on the cake with allegation of ball tampering brought against the national Test captain Dinesh Chandimal during the second Test against West Indies at Gros Islet, St Lucia’s.
How well the present administration of SLC handles the ball tampering issue remains to be seen. For if not handled properly the captain stands a chance to be charged and handed a punishment where he may have to sit out the third and final night (pink ball) Test against West Indies at Bridgetown, Barbados starting on June 23. If that happens Sri Lanka already without two of their most experienced batters Angelo Mathews and Dimuth Karunaratne can ill-afford to lose another top order in-form batsman which would weaken the team further. After Kusal Mendis (238 runs), Chandimal is the next highest leading run-getter for his team with 229 runs. They are the only batsmen to take a century apiece off the Windies bowling so far in the series.
Immediately as the allegation surfaced Sri Lanka Cricket which is under a Competent Authority put out this media release backing its players and team. It read:
“SLC advised the team to take the field to ensure the continuity of the match and wish to commend the decision taken by the team to continue with the game ‘under protest’ to ensure the upholding of the spirit of the game. The team management has informed us that Sri Lankan players have not engaged in any wrongdoing. SLC shall take all necessary steps to defend any player, in the event any unwarranted allegation is brought against a member of the team.”
Following the recent Smith-Warner-Bancroft ball tampering affair in March in the third Test between Australia and South Africa at Cape Town the umpires seem to have got jittery over anyone putting their hands in their pockets and taking anything out.
Chandimal’s offence is that he put his hand into his pocket and took out some sweets which he put into his mouth and then started to apply saliva on the ball which made the umpires suspicious of what he was trying to do. But where the umpires erred was that after that incident the ball was continued to be used for about 30 odd overs before the umpires finally decided to change it. Also, the umpires failed to follow the normal protocol of informing the fielding side of the incident at the end of the day (2nd day) but waited until ten minutes before the start of play on the third day to do so which led to an unnecessary delay by two hours as Sri Lankan officials argued with ICC officials on the charge brought against them. Perhaps the umpires delayed their decision to communicate with the fielding side at the end of the second day as they wanted sufficient evidence on video footage before laying the charge. Whatever it was their timing was not right.
This is not the first time that Sri Lanka are confronted with allegations by the ICC. The most notable one was the Muthiah Muralitharan ‘chucking affair’ in the Melbourne Test on Boxing Day against Australia in 1996 and three years later involving the same bowler again in Australia at Adelaide in a ODI against England that led to skipper Arjuna Ranatunga putting his career on the line to defend his key bowler and then escaping with a suspended sentence for bringing disrepute to the game by arguing with umpire Ross Emerson on the middle of the pitch and thereby causing undue delay to play.
The third incident concerned dashing batsman Kusal Perera when he was provisionally suspended by ICC for failing an out-of-competition drugs test on October 2015. He was banned in December but the ICC lifted the sanction in May 2016 declaring Perera’s results “not sustainable”.
“Had it not been for the diligence of Mr Perera’s legal team and the ICC’s own desire to uncover the explanation for the reported findings, the consequences could well have been different, and that should be of concern to all involved in the fight against doping,” Dave Richardson, the ICC chief executive said.
In Ranatunga’s and Perera’s case it was on the legal team’s advice that Sri Lanka was able to overturn the accusations leveled against them and Muralitharan then had the full backing of SLC which went to great pains and lengths to clear his name. The key here is that on all three previous occasions there was an elected body in place to defend the accused. In Chandimal’s case he has a temporary administration to support him. How well they have succeeded the outcome will be known shortly.
