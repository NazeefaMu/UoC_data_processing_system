Yoshitha allowed to travel abroad for 20 days

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa's second son Yoshitha Rajapaksa was allowed to travel to Australia by court yesterday.
His passport was impounded by Court as part of magisterial inquiry over alleged money laundering at Carlton Sports Network (CSN). He was yesterday permitted to travel to Australia for 20 days by the Colombo High Court.
While permitting Yoshitha Rajapaksa to travel to Australia, Colombo High Court Judge A. A. R. Heiyantuduwa ordered the Kaduwela Magistrate’s Court to temporarily release his passport.
Rajapaksa through his counsel had sought an order from the Colombo High Court to temporarily lift his travel ban.
Filing a motion, President’s Counsel Jayantha Weerasinghe appearing on behalf of Yoshitha Rajapaksa had informed Court that his client is expecting to leave Australia from December 10 to 31, for his ankle treatment.
The Attorney General did not raise objections to the request. On March 14, 2016, four suspects including Yoshitha Rajapaksa, Nishantha Ranatunga and Rohan Weliwita were remanded over alleged money laundering case.They are currently on bail.
