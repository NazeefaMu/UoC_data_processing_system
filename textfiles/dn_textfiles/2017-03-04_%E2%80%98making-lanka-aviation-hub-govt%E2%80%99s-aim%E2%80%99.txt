‘Making Lanka an aviation hub, Govt’s aim’

Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said the goal of the national government is to make Sri Lanka an aviation hub in the Asian region.
He was addressing the Sri Lanka Air Force 66th anniversary celebrations at the Ratmalana Airport yesterday.
“We are very proud of the dedicated service rendered by the Sri Lanka Air Force for the country’s development,” Minister de Silva said.
The minister thanked the Sri Lanka Air Force for its support to develop technology that creates new opportunities and challenges.
Minister de Silva pointed out that there is a shortage of air traffic controllers in the aviation industry.
 “I request the Sri Lanka Air Force to train as many air traffic controllers as possible and provide job opportunities for the younger generation,”he said.
He further said that the aviation industry also should focus on developing aircraft mechanical repair and maintenance work. The minister thanked all past and the present personnel for their contribution towards enabling the Air Force reach greater heights.
