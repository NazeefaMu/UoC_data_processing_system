The bell tolls for them (at last)

Things appear to be moving at long last. A full two and half years following the election of President Maithripala Sirisena to office, on a pledge to rope in the corrupt, the law is closing on the big time crooks and swindlers of the Rajapaksa administration. It is indeed inexplicable as to why the wheels of justice took so long to turn unless it was deliberately being stalled by interested parties as is now coming to light. True, law’s delay is a perennial problem associated with Sri Lanka’s justice system. But this alone could not have been the reason. The trial in the murder of High Court judge Sarath Ambepitiya was concluded in a matter of seven months and the accused sentenced to death. Hence there was no reason as to why the present high profile cases could not have been dispensed with soon after the new government came into power. After all, prosecution of those involved in mega corruption was the main plank of the election platform of the Common Candidate, and as such, should been given the utmost priority.
According to our main story in yesterday’s edition, 37 figures in the Rajapaksa government are to be hauled before courts in the coming days. Among them are former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa, former first son Namal Rajapaksa and then Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunga. Former Chief Minister Prasanna Ranatunga, Ex- Provincial Council Minister Udaya Gammanpila, former ministers Johnston Fernando and Mahindananda Aluthgamage are also among the lot. According to Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya PC, indictments have been served on all the accused in the cases against them and trial dates have already been fixed.
As already mentioned, exposure of the wrong doers is long overdue, with the public clearly losing patience, wondering if government politicians were in fact lying when they spoke about the specific instances of corruption against the Rajapaksas. What is more, the culprits had taken to assume a holier than thou posture and has started pointing the accusing finger at government ministers and is currently going to town on the alleged Bond scam which is been heard by a Special Presidential Commission appointed by the Yahapalanaya government. The Ravi Karunanayake episode came like manna from heaven to the Joint Opposition which keeps hammering on, to detract from the serious allegations against its own members. With the cases against Rajapaksa and Co. now poised to be opened, there is the familiar refrain of a witch-hunt being launched against the former first family, to cover up the government’s own shortcomings, particularly from Namal Rajapaksa, in a bid to throw dust in the eyes of the public.
It is not just the former ministers and their cohorts, all persons who held public office against whom there are multifarious allegations should be investigated and justice meted out to those found guilty. The law should pursue individuals who caused massive losses to the state by their acts of commission and omission. The authorities certainly cannot afford to overlook the hedging deal which caused an astronomical loss to the state. Nor can one ignore the Greek Bond losses in which the former Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal had a direct hand. We say this because this personage has now offered to appear before the Special Presidential Commission to help unravel the alleged Bond scam, which clearly is a red herring laid to detract from his own misdeeds.
No stone should be left unturned to get at the accumulated loot, said to have been stashed away in offshore accounts, and expose the swindlers, who are today sitting pretty, thanks to the clear attempts being made to bury their cases. Not just the crooks, but their collaborators too should be brought to book. No doubt, every effort will be made by the offenders to create a circus at the court houses they are to be taken to by bringing in their supporters in numbers, as we have already witnessed. All measures should be taken by the government to prevent such theatrics where the rogues disport themselves as heroes. There have been several instances in the recent past where our court houses have been desecrated by politicians and men in robes. Such incidents should be prevented at all cost.
Be that as it may, the government must ensure that justice is meted out even handedly and acts of corruption in the Yahapalanaya government should also be probed with equal zeal. It has set a commendable example in this respect by demonstrating that it means business when a powerful government minister, no less, was hauled before a Presidential Commission and virtually subjected to an inquisition by the state counsel, a scenario unthinkable under Rajapaksa. It is hoped that with the prosecution of the wrongdoers of the former regime, for which the mechanism has now been set in motion, we would see an end to scourge of corruption, that has eaten into the vitals of this country, and society at large, and every politician and government official made accountable for their actions.
