CICT voted Best Container Terminal in Asia under 4 mn TEUs

The CMPort managed Colombo International Container Terminals (CICT), the only deep water terminal in the Port of Colombo, has been voted the Best Container Terminal (under 4 million TEUs) in Asia at the prestigious Asian Freight, Logistics and Supply Chain (AFLAS) Awards hosted and organised by Asia Cargo News.
To win the coveted award, CICT competed with the top eight shortlisted terminals in the category, attracting worldwide attention to the capacity, capability and service levels it offers global shipping lines calling on Colombo.
The other terminals in the shortlist for the award were Busan New Container Terminal (South Korea), Da Chan Bay Terminal One (China), Dalian International Container Terminal (China), Fuzhou International Container Terminal (China), Jakarta International Container Terminal (Indonesia), Laem Chabang International Terminal (Thailand) and Manila International Container Terminal (Philippines).
The four finalists in the category were CICT, Busan New Container Terminal (BNCT), Jakarta International Container Terminal (JICT) and Manila International Container Terminal (MICT).
“From inception, our focus has been on the development of the Port of Colombo into a leader in the region through enhanced capacity, greater efficiency, innovation and eco-friendly operations, and this award is an affirmation that CICT has achieved its goal in the relatively short period,” CICT CEO Ray Ren said.
Catriona Jayasundera, Head of Marketing and Commercial at CICT said, “It was indeed a creditable achievement by any standard, given that CICT has been in operation for only three years.We dedicate this prestigious award to ‘Team CICT’ whose commitment, dedication and team work made it possible,” she added.
CICT reported a throughput of 2 million TEUs for the 12 months ending December 31, 2016 achieving impressive YoY growth of 28 per cent in volume and enabling the Port of Colombo to register overall incremental growth in the three consecutive years since CICT came into operation. The incremental volume handled by CICT was one of the contributors to the overall throughput of the Port of Colombo growing by an estimated 11 per cent in 2016.
