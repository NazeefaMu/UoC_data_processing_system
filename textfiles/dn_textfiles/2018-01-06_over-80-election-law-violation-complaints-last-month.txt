Over 80 election law violation complaints last month

Sri Lanka Police have recorded 83 complaints of election law violations from December 9 to January 5.
The police report said that 103 people were arrested as a result, with 12 being candidates. One of the candidates is still in remand.
Police Media Spokesperson SP Ruwan Gunasekara, addressing a media briefing at the Elections Secretariat yesterday, explained that of this number, 54 were complaints made to the police while 29 were raids conducted by the police. Most of the complaints were with regard to property damage and intimidation, he added.
The police have also decided to take into custody election material in possession of individuals caught violating election laws as court productions. They will then estimate the value of all these goods and send it to the Election Secretariat. “This will be valuable information when it comes to court cases regarding a candidate’s assets or any election law violation case lodged in court,” said SP Gunasekara.
