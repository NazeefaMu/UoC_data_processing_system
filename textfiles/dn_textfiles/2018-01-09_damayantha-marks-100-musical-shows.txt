The show is a landmark concert for Damayantha Kuruppu who presented his very first show with late Clarence Wijewardena in 1975 at Nawaragahala. The show was titled Super Golden Chimes - Super concert with Milton Mallawaarachi. It was also Milton's very first solo concert. Damayantha had just completed his AL's when he presented the Super concert.
Following the successful presentation of concert in 1975 Damayantha left for UK to pursue his higher studies in Hotel management. In 2001 Damayantha got back into local show biz with Tribute to Clarence which was a fund raiser for his Alma mater Ananda College Colombo.
His entertainment company at the time was known as DR Entertainments where he was supported by Rajiv Sebastian. Damayantha presented several shows prior to setting up his own show biz company DK Promotions in 2004. In the past 17 years to date Damayantha has presented more than 100 shows with different titles and concepts.
The shows presented were not only for Sir Lankan but also International artists such as world famous Sir Cliff Richard live in concert in 2007, Daniel O'Donnell in 2014 and 2017, Tony Christies in 2017 to name just a few.
DK promotions have presented some of the shows in collaboration with various schools and organizations as fund raisers. Most leading singers and musicians have worked with DK Promotions in presenting their 40th and 50th anniversary concerts.
Damayantha emphasized on the point that at all times his prime motive was to provide quality entertainment to the Sri Lankan public.
"Show biz was never a business for me it was only a passion. In fact I have lost millions in presenting some expensive shows specially the ones where I featured foreign artists" added Damayantha.
