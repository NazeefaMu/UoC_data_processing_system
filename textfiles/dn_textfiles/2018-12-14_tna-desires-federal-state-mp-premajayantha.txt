TNA desires federal state: MP Premajayantha

Parliamentarian Susil Premajayantha said that there were no political prisoners in the country but those who were convicted for numerous offences, including terrorism.
He was speaking at a press conference held in Colombo, yesterday.
He added that the number of high-profile assassination cases such as those of former Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar, former Minister Jeyaraj Fernandopulle, and D.M. Dassanayake were still open and that the suspects were still in remand custody.
“More than 50 cases are being heard in High Courts; the prisoners are those convicted of assassinating people with explosives,” Premajayantha said.
Two of the suspects involved in the murder of two policemen in Batticaloa were linked to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) intelligence wing, he added.
“Newspapers have reported that United National Party Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe has promised the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) the immediate release of political prisoners,” Premajayantha said.
He added that during 2001, the TNA said that the LTTE was the representative of the Tamil community. The TNA was formed in 2001 and 15 of its members were elected to Parliament that same year.
In 2004, the party had 22 members in Parliament, he said, adding that it had abstained from contesting the 2015 Presidential election.
Premajayantha said that former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had promised the abolition of the Executive Presidency to the TNA. The country would be a federal state if the Executive Presidency were to be abolished, he added.
“The request for this abolition had come from the TNA; they wish to set up a federal state,” he added.
