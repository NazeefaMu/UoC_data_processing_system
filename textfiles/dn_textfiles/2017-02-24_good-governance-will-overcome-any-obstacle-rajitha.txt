Good Governance will overcome any obstacle: Rajitha

A deadly battalion is interrupting the ongoing programmes of the Good Governance Government and we will defeat them step by step, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Senaratne, the journey is not a red carpet ride and the difficult part is continuing the revolution. The Ministers in the current Government should understand this. The politicians make laws and the people should obey and follow such laws. When Parliament makes laws, the judiciary should implement them. During the previous regime, the rule of law was implemented according to political powers.
The minister made these remarks during the opening of the new building complex of the Warakapola base hospital.
The Minister pointed out that the new building complex constructed jointly by the Japanese Government and Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council is estimated at Rs. 1.1 billion. President Maithripala Sirisena obtained the grant during his tenure as the Health Minister.
He also obtained funds to build drug manufacturing plants of the State Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing Corporation (SPMC).
Senaratne said the people were fed up of changing political parties and it was why the National Government was formed. Japanese Ambassador Kenichi Suganuma and Chief representative of JAICA, Sri Lanka, Kiyoshi Amada were also present.
