Takas.lk Flagship Store  launched in Colombo 4

One of Sri Lanka’s most trusted and innovative e-commerce platform, Takas.lk, has launched its Flagship Store, to enable its customers to enjoy a seamless shopping experience that encompasses online, mobile and bricks-and-mortar options.
The opening of the Takas.lk Flagship Store featured a number of high profile business leaders including Takas (Pvt) Ltd board members and investors as well as several of its main suppliers.
Located Galle Road, Bamabalapitya, this new Flagship Store is a first for Takas.lk, marking its shift to an omni-channel, or multichannel, sales approach that will undoubtedly provide even more convenience and benefits for its customers.
“Takas.lk, being the largest pure play e-commerce site in Sri Lanka, is excited to explore the omni-channel experience and its many potential benefits to our loyal customers and partners. We feel the store concept will aid in online consumers being confident in terms of online buying, so the trust element will definitely increase,” said Lahiru Pathmalal, Co-Founder/CEO of Takas (Pvt) Ltd.
Established in 2012 by Pathmalal, Co-Founder/COO Murtaza Moosajee and Co-Founder Dilendra Wimalasekara, Takas.lk quickly distinguished itself as Sri Lanka’s largest online shopping mall.
Today, Takas.lk has consolidated its position as the most innovative e-commerce provider in the local marketplace, while also having evolved into one of the market’s most dynamic players.
Following the launch of its Flagship Store, Takas.lk plans to roll out similar stores in all major towns across Sri Lanka. “Around 6% of the revenue for Takas.lk currently comes from Monaragala, and we also do really well in Gampaha and in other key local markets.”
