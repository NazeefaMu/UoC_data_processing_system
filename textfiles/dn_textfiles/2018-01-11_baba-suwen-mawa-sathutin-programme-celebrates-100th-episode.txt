The 100th ‘“Baba Suwen – Mawa Sathutin (Healthy Baby – Happy Mother)’ programme by Panda Baby, Sri Lanka’s No.1 herbal baby care brand clinically tested for mildness in USA, was recently telecasted. In celebration of this milestone, a fun filled event was also organized for parents and children at the scenic ‘Ape Gama’ premises in Battaramulla.
This commemorative event was further enriched with the launch of the one-of-a-kind ‘Panda Baby Sellam Gedara (Panda Baby Play House)’; a large, beautiful mobile bus equipped with fun, exciting activities for young children. The ‘Baba Suwen – Mawa Sathutin’ programme first aired in late 2015 with the aim of providing valuable information and advice for parents and parents-to-be on raising happy, healthy children.
The programme is hosted by a renowned midwife with frequent guest visits from prominent doctors.
