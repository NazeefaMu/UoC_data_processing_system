5 Influential Fashion Icons

Powerful, talented, beautiful, strong. The best of the best, each in one in their own field. They are an inspiration for millions of women all over the world, not only for their talent and personality, but also for their style. We celebrate 5 among the world’s most influential fashion icons. -Vogue

Solange Knowles:In Solange’s artistic life fashion and music are equally important. And we can see that from the streetstyle looks showing that the star enjoys experimenting with flamboyant silhouettes and vibrant hues. And this is also proved by the videos from her third album, A Seat At The Table flaunting designs – from big names like Fendi, Acne Studios, Tibi, Chloé and so on, but also from emerging talents … – that become a means of communication, just like her music and lyrics.

 Rihanna: One thing is for sure, she never ceases to amaze on the red carpet. From the dramatic and voluminous pink gown from Giambattista Valli, to the precious yellow cape-gown by Guo Pei, to the Comme des Garçons design, a fabric sculpture more than a gown, to the sheer long dress from Adam Selman. And also off-duty RiRi likes to amaze: she loves sporty ensembles mixed with other styles and is never afraid to flaunt new trends, also very eccentric ones.

Beyoncé: while she is perfect on the red carpet dressed by the biggest designers, in real life she never disappoints. Also with her maternity wear. And last time she was expecting she truly offered her best style-wise, proving that her mommy curves should not be hidden but enhanced with contemporary and sensuous looks.

Naomi Campbell: What can we say about this super top model other than her perfect figure can make the simplest of dresses look totally magical? From her beginnings to present day, the black Venus with her stunning looks and strong personality has interpreted outfits of all shapes and styles, both on the catwalk and the red carpet. She looks gorgeous when clad in luminous long dresses with super-high slits but also when she wears minidresses playing up her amazing legs.

 
Michelle Obama: Mother, wife, former First Lady. Michelle Obama is the ‘power woman’ par excellence and with her classic yet modern style she has inspired women all over the world during her husband’s two presidential terms. Michelle favors A–line or circle skirt cocktail dresses and her elegance was best expresses at official events, clad in custom refined long dresses by the greatest designers.
