Government Radiological Technologists Association to launch strike on June 26

 
The Government Radiological Technologists Association (GRTA) will launch a trade union action from June 26 after staging a token strike on June today and tomorrow in the North Western Province, GRTA Secretary Dharmakeerthi Epa said.
According to Epa, trade union action will be taken in order to get all the transfers reversed.
The direct requests for Radiological examinations come from Kurunegala Teaching Hospital, Chilaw Hospital and the other state hospitals located in the North Western Province will be rejected. He was addressing media during a press conference held in Colombo.
According to Epa, the transfers of radiological technologists was made in order to cover night duties in state hospitals in the North Western Province while to have a `control' over the membership of the union. This is very unreasonable. 
Now 22 days passed since the union members started a work to rule campaign. There is no response from the relevant health authorities. Therefore the token strike and other trade union actions will be taken, he added.
