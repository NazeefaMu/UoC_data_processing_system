The 16 paragons of virtue

The 16 rebel SLFP MPs who quit the Yahapalanaya government following the abortive No Confidence Motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe have decided to go public and expose the ‘frauds and misdeed’ of their one time colleagues in the same government. Former Petroleum Minister Chandima Weerakkody, addressing a media conference, on Tuesday, said it was they, of the SLFP, who first exposed the bond scam and UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera, it was, who complained to the Bribery Commission on the matter.
Asked by a journalist as to why they kept silent for the last three years and planning to come out with these exposures only now, Weerakkody said they were earlier bound by Cabinet responsibility, plus decency, which precluded them from spilling the beans prior to this.
Is the former minister expecting the public to swallow this line? If, as he says, it was the SLFP -which included the gang of 16- that exposed the bond scam, what prevented them from coming out with the other acts of corruption and misdeeds which he says took place within the Yahapalanaya government which they were going to go public with only now after three years.
He also says that collective Cabinet responsibility was the reason that sealed their lips. This collective Cabinet responsibility did not prevent the likes of Susil Premajayantha openly criticizing the Hambantota port agreement nor Dayasiri Jayasekera lambasting Minister Arjuna Ranatunga during the recent fuel distribution crisis. Hence, it needed little encouragement for Weerakkody and the rest of his conscientious colleagues in the gang of 16 to expose the frauds and corruption which he says were rampant in the government.
He also cites decency as another reason that kept them from enumerating each corrupt act of his then ministerial colleagues. Well, it is entirely left to the public to judge the level of decency in our politicians, of all hues. Suffice it to say that Weerakkody was one of the ministers (the other being Dayasiri Jayasekera) who stuck in their toes and refused to quit their posts even after leaving the government following the failed No Confidence Motion stating that they could be removed only by the President. How decent it is to sit with his own Prime Minister at the Cabinet after attempting to oust him through a No Confidence Motion only Weerakkody will be able to explain.
Former Minister Weerakkody could also not be unaware that some of his colleagues in the gang of 16 entered parliament through the National List, curtsy President Maithripala Sirisena, after losing at the General Election. How decent it is to turn their backs on their own leader who bailed them out from being thrown to the political wilderness, by spurning his efforts to continue with the Unity Government and make common cause with his political enemies, also only Weerakkody will be able to unravel.
Be that as it may, the SLFP rebels, who, until now, enjoyed ministerial office, are hardly in a position to clean up the Augean stables and emerge squeaky clean. Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake, who, these days, has taken up the role of a crusader against corruption, has come out with some startling revelations in respect of one of them.
Now that the subject of a cleanup and going public (with the misdeeds of the government) has been brought up by a former member of the Cabinet, no less, President Sirisena should take immediate steps to probe his claim and ferret out the acts of corruption among his ministers. The probe should also be extended to cover the allegations made by Deputy Minister Ramanayake and also reopening the case against another prominent rebel MP that was allowed to lie in abeyance while he was a minister in the Yahapalanaya Government.
Vesak and May Day
Much debate has swirled around the decision to shift the universal day of the working class, or May Day, as is commonly known, in Sri Lanka, this year on account of the Vesak week clashing with the event, the rational of the authorities being the sound and fury of the May Day would intrude into the sanctity of the period holy to all Buddhists.
While the Mahanayakes and the Buddhist clergy in general (one member of the Sangha has declared his opposition to having Vesak in April) are in favour of this move, there are those who contend that Vesak is hardly observed in the appropriate somber tones but where the accent is on celebrations, nay, revelry, as is clear from the Vesak revelers that descend on the city during this period, akin to a May Day roister.
This was the stated reason given by Buddhasasana Minister Gamini Jayawickrema Perera when he sought to ban Vesak pandals, so that the minds of the devotees are directed towards piety and serene contemplation during the Vesak period.
