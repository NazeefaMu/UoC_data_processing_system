Secret studio beneath a bridge

Plumber-turned-furniture designer Fernando Abellanas has built himself a studio that acrophobes wouldn’t want to visit. Abellanas has constructed his workplace under a bridge in Valencia, Spain, and it perfectly blends into the urban setting.
This under-bridge setup has a chair, a desk, and two shelves, providing all the storage space one could ask for in a regular office.
To access the micro dwelling, the designer uses a hand crank that transports the base to the furniture, bolted to the bridge’s concrete wall.
Abellanas is keeping the exact location of the studio a secret.
“The project is an ephemeral intervention,” he told the Spaces, via Curbed. “[It will remain] until someone finds it and decides to steal the materials, or the authorities remove it.”
