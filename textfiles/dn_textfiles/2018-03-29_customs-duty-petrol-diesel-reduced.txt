Customs duty on petrol, diesel reduced

The Customs duty on Petrol and Diesel has been reduced to Rs.12 and Rs.4 per liter respectively in order to maintain the same fuel prices.
Customs duty has been reduced to shield local fuel prices from the continuous price increase in crude oil recorded in the international market over the last three months.
Accordingly, the customs duty on a Petrol liter has been reduced from Rs. 35 to Rs. 12 where as the duty on a Diesel liter has been decreased from Rs. 15 to Rs. 4.
The government will endure the loss incurred from the duty reduction among all other welfare and development expenses.
When compared with the International Price Index, Sri Lanka provides fuel at a very low cost.
The government reduced the Petrol price per liter from Rs. 162 to Rs. 117 and Diesel price from Rs. 111 to Rs. 95. Even though the government continues with these same prices in 2018, the international fuel prices have continued to grow during the time span.
