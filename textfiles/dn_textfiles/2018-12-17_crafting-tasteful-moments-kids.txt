Crafting tasteful moments for kids

Children between the ages of 8 and 13 put on their aprons, as Ma’s Kitchen hosted their Christmas ginger bread event at their Food Studio in Thimbirigasyaya on December 8. The Ma’s Kitchen cooking events are a fun way for kids to flex their creative muscles, spend time working in teams, and best of all: a great way to introduce them to the joy of baking especially during the festive season.
“There was so much excitement as the kids rolled-out their gingerbread dough. We believe that it’s important to encourage children to experiment with cooking at a young age. Especially during family holidays it’s important to make them feel part of the occasion. Getting involved in cooking allows them to not only learn about the different ingredients and how they blend together, it’s about harnessing imagination and their creativity,” said MA’s Kitchen Communications Manager, Sarah De Alwis. Cooking teaches kids valuable skills that they can carry with them through life. The kids cooking events are organised by Ma’s Kitchen, with the hope to give kids the chance to learn and improve their skills.
