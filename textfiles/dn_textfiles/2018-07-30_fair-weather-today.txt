Fair weather today

Except for few showers in the Western, Central and Sabaragamuwa Provinces, mainly fair weather will prevail elsewhere, the Meteorology Department said.
Showers or thundershowers will occur in a few places in the Uva Province after 2.00 pm.
Fairly strong gusty winds up to 40-50 kmph can be expected in the Hambantota and Matale districts.
There may be temporary localised strong winds during thundershowers.
The public is advised to take precautions against lightning.
The sea areas extending from Puttalam to Pottuvil via Negombo, Galle and Hambanthota can be rough at times as the wind speed can increase up to 50-60 kmph. The Naval and fishing communities are requested to be vigilant in this regard.
