A “Hyper-Real” experience

Invoke (Pvt) Ltd, recently initiated a brand new concept that allows potential homeowners to get a complete immersive experience of their home and to even be able to customize it to their specific tastes and see it come to life in real time even before it is actually built. Introduced for the first time in Sri Lanka, “Hyper Real” is the new virtual reality model apartment that provides the layout, design and even furnishing and decorative options.
Their ground-breaking service merges the critical elements of advance technology, technical skill and pure artistry in interior design to breathe life into your project giving you a decisive edge above the rest. Still visuals, Virtual Tours and 3D Walkthroughs are now standard offerings. Invoke in collaboration with Odlo VFX makes it possible to not just visualize, but to have a true-to-life experience of your apartment in spectacular detail in real-time and in Ultra High Definition.
“As marketing consultants in the highly lucrative and competitive real estate industry, we are constantly looking for ways to help developers be a step ahead of the competition. With this new “Hyper Real” we offer the possibility of expanding the sense of experience of your client by letting them immerse themselves in an Ultra High Definition virtual environment of their future home. In essence it is a whole new level of service and client empowerment,” stated the management trio in a recently issued press release.
