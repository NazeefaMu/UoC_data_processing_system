CIS beats Presbyterians in a thriller

Colombo International School (CIS) lasses dished out a courageous performance to tame Presbyterian Girls School (PGS), Dehiwala in their own den (39-37) and walked away with the 'B' division under-17 cagers title when the two teams battled it out in a thrilling final yesterday. CIS posted a narrow one point lead at half time (16-15).
Home team dominated the first quarter and scored 12 points while restricting visitors to five points. But in the following quarter visitors made a wise decision to send two players for a full court man-to-man defence, where two key Presbyterian attackers were blocked. CIS bounced back strongly in attack as well and scored 11 points to close the gap while only conceding three points to opponents in the second quarter.
After the breather both teams tried hard to seize the lead and it has been a ding-dong battle for a while.

After scores were tied at 19 all, three back to back baskets from homesters saw turning the tide for Presbyterians. But CIS did not allow them to make merry and came up with a good counter attack. With Leia Hamza sinking a three pointer, once again CIS leveled the scores at 25 all. This score stood at the end of penultimate quarter.
Even in the final quarter both teams fought hard and Presbyterians maintained their lead in the beginning.
During the latter stage CIS captain Sinali Ilangage scored two back to back baskets to level the scores at 36 all. After Presbyterians scored a single point just before the final whistle, Sinali scored a superb three pointer to steal the victory (39-36).
Leia Hamza of CIS who scored 19 points in the final was adjudged the Most Valuable Player of the Tournament while her team mate captain Sinali Ilangage who scored nine points was awarded the Best Defensive Player trophy. Ishadi Wathsala of Presbyterian GS was picked as the Best Offensive Player.
Sirimovo Bandaranaike MV bagged the third place beating St. Bridget's Convent 44-36 in the consolation final on Tuesday at the same venue.
