TCK dance troupe marks 45th anniversary

One of Kandy’s cultural icons, the Trinity College National Drum and Dance Troupe celebrated its 45th anniversary today with a special performance of ‘Rangavali’, the troupe’s 90-minute show at the college hall.
Trinity was among the first schools in the country to form a troupe of this nature. The school has always wanted its students to be deeply rooted in their culture while being able to reach out and learn, and experience other cultures.
Learning Kandyan and Low Country dancing has been a tradition at Trinity but it was for the school’s centenary celebrations in 1972 that a full troupe was formed and performed. It was the brainchild of the then Principal Lionel Fernando.
The Trinity troupe has participated in many historic events including the consecration of the Anglican Cathedral on Bauddhaloka Mawatha in Colombo.
This troupe has won the inter-school and youth drum and dance competitions many times. The troupe has also travelled to many countries and won several trophies in international competitions. For many years Karunadasa Rajapakse, a professional Ves dancer, was the teacher who trained the troupe and his work.
The work of the Manager late S J Madugalle is also remembered at this time.
Trinity is best known for the famous sportsmen and men of letters it has produced, but it has also succeeded in cultural aspects.
