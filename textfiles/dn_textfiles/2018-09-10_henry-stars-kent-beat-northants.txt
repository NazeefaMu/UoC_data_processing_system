Henry stars as Kent beat Northants

LONDON, Friday - New Zealand pace bowler Matt Henry ended with 11 wickets in the match as Kent beat Northants in Division Two at Canterbury.
Victory took Kent back above Sussex, who completed a win over Leicestershire on Thursday, into the promotion spots. Henry followed his first-innings 7-42 with 4-72 as the visitors were bowled out for 217 to lose by 102 runs.
Northants began day four on 56-3 chasing 320 to win but Adam Rossington (56) was the only batsman to pass 50.
Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire both took 12 points from their County Championship draw at Trent Bridge.
Tom Kohler-Cadmore (106) reached his first Championship hundred for Yorkshire, who batted on after securing maximum batting points. Tim Bresnan's 80 helped them to 498 all out - a first-innings lead of 50.
Openers Kraigg Brathwaite and Ben Slater averted any chance of a spectacular Notts collapse, guiding the hosts to 93-1 when a draw was agreed.
Middlesex batsman Sam Robson dug in with a defiant 41 not out to secure his side a draw as Gloucestershire made a late bid for victory on the last day. But 2016 county champions Middlesex look set to spend another season in Division Two as a result.
Earlier Miles Hammond's 123 not out ensured Gloucestershire declared on 251-8 to set Middlesex 306 in 40 overs. Middlesex wobbled to 29-4 and then 56-5 before Robson and Stevie Eskinazi (20 not out) steered them to a draw.
