GMOA threatens more trade union action

 
The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) will take stern trade union action against any effort made in order to introduce `SAITM friendly minimum standards' for medical education, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing media during a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo today he said that the National Policies and Economic Affairs Deputy Minister  Dr. Harsha De Silva's duty completed when he handed over the report on SAITM issue to the President.
‘But he is using a power that does not exist; he had called a meeting recently. He is using a power that he is no longer entitled to’, Haritha Aluthge said.
 Aluthge pointed out that even the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) informed him that they cannot take part in the meeting since there are contradictions between the committee report facts.
‘They said that they cannot arrive at a final decision without contacting lengthy internal discussions and the so called meeting went ahead with some fake stake holders’, Aluthge said.
UGC Chairman and the Official from the Attorney General's Department have already rejected 17 minimum standards proposed by the SLMC and have also distorted the SLMC proposals.
Therefore the so called `minimum standards for medical education' formulated by those two persons will be fake and they will be aimed at including current SAITM low standards within this minimum standards, he added.
