Tense situation erupts at BIA due to strike

 
A tense situation erupted at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) due to a strike launched by airport employees, a short while ago.
All functions of the BIA are reportedly hampered due to the strike.
The strike was launched after airport authorities failed to meet the employees demand to increase their salary by Rs.10,000,  at a meeting held this morning. 
Security surveillance has also been tightened at the airport.
