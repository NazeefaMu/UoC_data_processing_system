Three hundred and two places have been identified as potential landslide prone spots in Galle district and 227 locations were identified as risky locations, Galle District Planning Director Pushpa Malalasekara said.
She was submitting a report on post-flood relief initiatives of the district at the District Coordinating Committee Meeting held recently at the district secretariat auditorium.
The meeting was presided over by co-chairs minister Chandima Weerakkodi and Galle District MP Wijayapala Hettiarachchi.
Malalasekara further said that initially only 302 landslide prone spots were identified.
“However National Building Research Organization (NBRO) carried out explorations on the sites and identified 227 spots as risky places and recommended to remove 80 families from such sites,” she said.
A special scheme has also been launched to provide substitute lands for people who live at unsafe localities, Malalasekara further said.
