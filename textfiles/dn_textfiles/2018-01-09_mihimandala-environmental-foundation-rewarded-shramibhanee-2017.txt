Mihimandala established in 2000 and one of the leading environmental organizations was rewarded at the Shramabhimanee 2017 held at BMICH.
This was mainly for their continuous efforts of protection of nature and also for their anti AIDS campaign in support with the government to eliminate the disease in 2025 from Sri Lanka.
Mihimandala is an organization which was formed in November, 2000 by a group of nature lovers. The need to form the organization was obvious. Mankind quite unwittingly in his search for progress was devastating the environment.
A thousand clamoring voices were raised in protest and in warning. We are one such voice. Mankind’s hope of survival devolves upon him the need to protect his environment and our voice is raised to create an awareness of this need. We are a nonprofit motivated organization.
