Mechanism for drivers to donate body organs?

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne addressing the monthly progress review meeting held on Thursday at the Health Ministry, instructed officials to submit a report within a month on the possibility of creating a mechanism for drivers to make a declaration expressing their consent to donate organs such as kidneys, eyes, heats and livers in case of accidental deaths.
According to Dr. Senaratne, many Buddhists are willing to donate their body organs. It will help save many lives in the future. The body organs of the brain dead will also be transplanted in other patients. The programmes of similar nature are implemented in many foreign countries. The liver transplant programme which was disrupted in the past, will recommence shortly, the minister said.
Dr. Senaratne said OPDs of 23 state hospitals are supposed to open until 10.00 pm, but eight of them close at 8.00 pm due to transport difficulties. The issue will be solved with the assistance of the Transport Ministry. Sri Lanka imported drugs worth Rs. 40 billion and destroyed Rs. 300 million worth drugs at the end of every year in the past, but there was a drug shortage. The drug shortage ended with the assistance of a new software, he said.
Dr. Senaratne said all medical tests are available at state hospitals. Private blood collecting centres had earlier been mushrooming around the Colombo General Hospital and other state hospital. Blood tests of sixteen categories can be conducted in state hospitals with the assistance of new auto analyzers.
