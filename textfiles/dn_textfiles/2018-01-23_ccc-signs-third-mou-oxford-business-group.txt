CCC signs third MoU with Oxford Business Group

The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC) has signed a third memorandum of understanding (MoU) with OBG for its forthcoming publication. Under the MoU, the chamber will assist in the research for The Report: Sri Lanka 2018.   
Chairman of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, Rajendra Theagarajah, said he looked forward to teaming up once again with OBG to highlight the new opportunities emerging from Sri Lanka’s economic expansion.   
“Public-private partnerships are on the rise, while the need to address capacity constraints as part of the push to diversify exports will also bring openings for investors,” he said. “It will be a pleasure to explore these and other exciting developments with Oxford Business Group and, in turn, relay them to decision-makers who are keen to play a part in Sri Lanka’s future growth.”   
OBG’s Country Director in Sri Lanka Andrea Tsiachtsiri agreed that Sri Lanka’s efforts to open up to the global investment community were yielding results.   “Some structural issues will still need addressing for reforms to take full effect. However, years of growth, rising trade volumes and a strategically advantageous location have provided Sri Lanka with firm foundations on which to develop the national economy,” she said.   
“The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce is one of the leading and longest-serving Chambers of Commerce in the region, with a membership comprising every area of economic activity in the country. I’m delighted that our team and, ultimately, our readers will once again benefit from the expertise and local knowledge of the Ceylon Chamber.”   
The Report: Sri Lanka 2018 will be a vital guide to the many facets of the country, including its macroeconomics, infrastructure, banking and other sectoral developments. 
The publication will also contain contributions from leading representatives, including Maithripala Sirisena, President of Sri Lanka. It will be available in print and online.   
The Report on Sri Lanka 2018 will be produced with the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, the Board of Investment, PwC and the law firm John Wilson and Partners.
