SriLankan, Mihin corruption committee:
Weliamuna report perusal a must - Kabir

The J.C. Weliamuna report should be considered if a Presidential Commission investigates into the alleged massive corruptions committed at SriLankan Airlines and Mihin Air during the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime, said Public Enterprise Development Minister Kabir Hashim in Parliament yesterday.
He also said that the Public Enterprise Development Ministry has taken all measures to take legal action on the Mihin Lanka corruption. He also added that if the COPE Committee would initiate further investigations into the incident, his ministry would extend its fullest support.
Minister Kabir Hashim made these observations when Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna Parliamentarian Dr. Nalinda Jayathissa charged that the government was not taking adequate steps on the corruption report of SriLankan Airlines.
He made the charge during the round of questions for oral answers. He questioned as to why the Government does not take steps based on the JC Weliamuna report which this government had spent much to investigate and prepare.
Minister Kabir Hashim further stated that the government has handed over the reports of the SriLankan Airlines and Mihin Air corruptions to the FCID and the Police to take further legal action. He added that it was a collective responsibility of all the members of Parliament take responsibility with regard to taking further legal action.
