Northern Province GMOA doctors on strike tomorrow

 
Doctors attached to state hospitals in the Northern Province will launch a strike tomorrow from 8.00 am to 12.00 noon in protest of the private medical faculty at SAITM, Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoysa said in a statement.
Dr. Zoysa said it was possible the strike would extend to other provinces, if the GMOA doctors decided to join.
This is the seventh phase of the series of strikes launched by the GMOA in the nine provinces.
