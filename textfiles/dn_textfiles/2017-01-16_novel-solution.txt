A novel solution

Sri Lanka is in for an energy crunch according to experts in the power and energy sector. Just last week, there were two dire warnings - that the country could be headed for a water shortage as well as an energy shortage due to the prevailing drought in many parts of the country. The fact that we are facing an energy crisis has been known for some time. The coal power plant that was built amidst much fanfare by the previous government was more non-operational than operational.
No other big power plants can be constructed immediately which adds to the urgency of finding a solution to the energy crisis. However, there is a proposal which is akin to killing two birds with one stone. If implemented, this proposal would take care of two of the most pressing problems facing the country in one ‘go'. One is the garbage problem and the other concerns energy.
Garbage disposal has become one of the most pressing issues especially in Colombo, not to mention other major cities such as Kandy and Galle. Several tonnes of garbage, especially solid waste, are collected every day in Colombo. Disposing of this waste has become a huge issue. They cannot be buried or burned and the local bodies have resorted to the practice of dumping the waste on an empty land. These landfills have become an eyesore, apart from the unbearable stench. Stray cats and dogs have become another menace at these landfills. They tend to get soggy on rainy days, which adds to the woes of nearby residents. In a strictly environmental sense, landfills are also unhealthy for the planet as they mostly contain non-biodegradable objects such as plastics.
It has long been known that garbage can be used to generate energy. Such projects are common in many countries. However, the technology is somewhat expensive for most developing countries. Hence the importance of two private entities coming forward to build power plants that would use garbage as the source material. This will be a breakthrough for power generation and garbage disposal. By burning up to 900 MT of garbage per day in Colombo and Gampaha districts, they will generate a fair amount of power that can be channeled to the national grid operated by the Ceylon Electricity Board.
Depending on the success of this venture, this system of power generation can be introduced island wide. Solving the garbage problem alone will be a big achievement - power generation will be a bonus. The Government should seek more proposals from the private sector on energy generation and garbage disposal. Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) are ideal for these ventures since public bodies usually do not have the funds or the efficiency needed for this type of operation.
In a way, garbage can be called a renewable sort of energy because there is no sign of it running out. Yes, we should minimise food and other waste, but things do not always go according to plan. But there are types of renewable energy that do not depend on any kind of waste material at all. Wind power and solar power are two classic examples. Sri Lanka is blessed with a geographical position and climate patterns that make these energy options viable and vital. Several wind and solar projects are currently under construction in various part of the country. At first they will contribute only a fraction of the energy requirements but in the coming years they will play a bigger role in the energy generation mix. The Government has already started a “solar power battle” aimed especially at rural areas. Supplying mains electricity to these remote villages is often not cost-effective due to physical infrastructure constraints. It is far easier to install solar net metering systems which can also supply excess power to the national grid.
It may sound farfetched but wave energy is another type of renewable energy that we must look at in the future. Sri Lanka is surrounded by the ocean which in itself is a huge source of energy. Some countries already harness wave energy to generate power. Sri Lanka will be able to look closely at this technology as economies of scale kick in and the costs are reduced.
Still, the best way to conserve energy and to cut costs is to take a few simple steps at home. Turning off unwanted appliances and bulbs, walking to the junction instead of taking the car and using energy efficient appliances are just a few such steps. Big things begin with a few simple steps and energy consumption reduction is no exception.
