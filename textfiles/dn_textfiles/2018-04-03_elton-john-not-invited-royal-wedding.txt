Elton John not invited to royal wedding

Sir Elton John has yet to receive an invitation to attend Prince Harry’s wedding to Meghan Markle, despite clearing his schedule in anticipation of the big day.
The Rocket Man hitmaker had been personal friends with the groom’s late mother, Princess Diana, and he has stayed in touch with both Harry and his big brother William ever since performing at her funeral in 1997.
In February Elton fuelled speculation he would be among the 600 guests celebrating the nuptials at Windsor Castle in England as he cancelled two of his Las Vegas residency shows around the May 19 wedding date, but it appears the singer and his husband David Furnish are still waiting for their official invites, which were mailed out earlier last month.
“We haven’t had an invitation yet,” the musician told BBC Radio 2 on March 28
Even if Elton and David miss out on attending the actual ceremony, the rocker plans to take part in the public festivities to mark the wedding in and around the city of Windsor, where they own a home.
“I live on a hill (in Windsor), so I could just roll down there,” he quipped. “It’s rolling distance.”
During the interview, the singer, who was a guest at Prince William’s 2011 nuptials to Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, was asked if perhaps he would be performing at Harry and Meghan’s wedding reception instead, as the post-chapel party is due to be a more intimate affair, with just 200 of the couple’s loved ones at the nearby Frogmore House.
However, Elton used the opportunity to apparently crack a joke at the Spice Girls’ expense, after Mel B recently suggested they would be reuniting to perform at the event.
“Oh probably, yes, along with Kanye West and Kendrick Lamar,” Elton quipped in response to the reception question, mockingly adding, “I mean the Spice Girls, no one’s going to beat them off the stage are they? I mean, they’re just huge!”
It’s not clear why Mel B decided to go public with the royal wedding comments in February bandmates Emma Bunton and Mel C have both since spoken out to dismiss the gossip, claiming Scary Spice was just “joking”.
