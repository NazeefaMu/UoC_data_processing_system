SLPP flops in Chilaw PS meeting

The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), which won a majority seats in Chilaw Pradeshiya Sabha, failed to pass its maiden proposal on appointing a chairman.
The maiden meeting of the Chilaw Pradeshiya Sabha was held yesterday at its auditorium in Madampe. Out of 31 seats in the Pradeshiya Sabha, SLPP has 16 seats, UNP has 10 seats, SLFP has three seats and the JVP and the Sama Samaja Party have one seat each.
Pradeshiya Sabha member Sanjeewa Tissera stated that the SLPP was not fair in appointing the Chairman and Vice Chairman.
Two members of the SLPP voted against the Chairman’s proposal along with the UNP, SLFP and Sama Samaja Party members. A 15 member committee was appointed to make administrative decisions of the Pradeshiya Sabha and the group against the Chairman could appoint SLFP member Ranga Perera as its Chairman.
