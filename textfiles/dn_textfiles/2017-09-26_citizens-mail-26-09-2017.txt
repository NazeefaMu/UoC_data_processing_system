[CITIZENS' Mail - (26-09-2017)]

Guinness-worth record
The recent bail granted to two convicts of the same crime within hardly three weeks of the sentence, became a hilarious joke in society with some quipping it to be the latest Guinness Book entry.
It is a common phenomenon for the convicts to apply for bail on medical grounds. Despite whatever the crime they have committed, these ‘Very Important’ criminals suddenly find themselves in need of medication at the time of the sentence. They expect VIP medical treatment that they had been used to. They need specialists at their beck and call. They would conveniently forget that the overseas medical treatment and check-ups come at state expense. And worse still is when they forget the current day agony that the genuine patients are undergoing. Once released we see these convicts and accused travelling around the country as well as internationally and addressing public meetings with vim, vigour and vitality and other social functions.
In the eyes of the general public once could see the bluff that is exposed by these characters. A good idea would be for Court authorities to call for a 6 months medical report of the accused to be presented to Court when the case is initially called with follow-up instructions to the JMO till the conclusion of the case.
