Municipal Solid Waste Processing Centres mooted to turn garbage into electricity

The Megapolis and Western Development Ministry has proposed to set up Municipal Solid Waste Processing Centres to turn garbage into electricity. The plan which was approved by Cabinet yesterday also proposed to implement a ‘feed-in-tariff’ (flat tariff for 20 years) of Rs 36.20/kWh for electricity purchases from these centres.
The proposal also asked that garbage not be dumbed at Kolonnawa-Meetotumulla but moved to these centres.
A cabinet proposal to establish Municipal Solid Waste Processing Centres was first put forward in December 2016. It asked that facilities be set up in Thumbowila, Karadiyana and Muthurajawela by Fairway Holdings Pvt Ltd and KCHT Lanka Jang Pvt. Ltd. The final approval, subject to conditions was granted in January 2017. For the last 20 years, garbage from the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) area was dumped on 15 acres of land in Bloemendhal. In 2014, however due to wide protests from residents in the area, the Supreme Court asked the Urban Development Authority (UDA) to move the dump site on to two acres of land in Kolonnawa-Meethotumulla for two years during which a suitable solid waste management project should be formulated.
It is in response to this that the UDA together with the Ministry of Megapolis has come up with an energy generation project through garbage to find a more permanent solution to the mountains of garbage produced every day.
In January 2017, Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUBSL) was asked to come up with a way to finalize ‘fair tariff structure’ for the waste energy project. The UDA reports that on September 6, 2015, the UDA sent an official letter to the CMC to stop dumping garbage at Kolonnawa and to identify alternative yards but received no response in return. On 21 December 2015, the UDA sent another notice reiterating their earlier request.
