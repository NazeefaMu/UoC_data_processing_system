Wife of vetern singer in jewellery scam

The wife of a veteran singer who was implicated in a gold jewellery scam, named Hasini Nilakshi Ratnayake, was taken into custody after she had surrendered to the Police through her lawyer yesterday.
The 32-year-old woman had been employed at a state bank from November 11, 2012 to April 22, 2016, while the Manager of the Bank had lodged a complaint with the Tangalle Police on May 19, 2016 regarding a Rs. 1,280,000 gold jewellery scam alleged to have taken place during that period.The suspect woman had been working at the pawning unit of the Bank at that time. She is being charged under the Public Property Act.
Meanwhile, sources claim that if this woman had failed to surrender to the Police yesterday, her husband too would have had to faced charges of trying to aid and abate in evading arrest.
According to the Police, investigations had been swept under the carpet and the investigations have not recommenced. It is also believed that certain parties may have been bribed to cover up the incident.
