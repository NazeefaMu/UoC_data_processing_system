‘Dayasiri skews Viggie and defends Executive Presidency’

The statements made by Northern Province Chief Minister C. V. Vigneshwaran affects severely to the unity and reconciliation between the Sinhala and Tamil communities, said Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara yesterday.
He also said that his statement was highly questionable as Vigneshwaran was a Supreme Court Judge in Sri Lanka.
The Minister was speaking at a press conference at the SLFP Headquarters.
He added that most of the ministers including him had nurtured have kept on the unity between the communities and on reconciliation. “When Vigneshwaran makes haphazard statements, how could we talk to people in the South,” the Minister said. “If he was to make such statements, we too would have to think twice on the proposed Constitutional amendments.”
“These types of statements are made to appease LTTE supporters and the NGOs,” the Minister said. “These statements would be an invitation to Sinhala extremists to raise their heads.” He questioned as to what would happen when powers are vested in Provincial Councils and the Executive Presidency is abolished it would allow politicians such as Vigneshwaran to stir communal sentiments.
He added that the ordinary Tamil Community does not need anything that Vigneshwaran was asking for and they only need to live peacefully under one country. “ So I think the people in the North have to take action against him,” the Minister said.
