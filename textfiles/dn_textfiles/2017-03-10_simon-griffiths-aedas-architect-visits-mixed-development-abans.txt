Simon Griffiths,  Aedas architect visits  mixed development by ABANS

Simon Griffiths, Executive Principal of Aedas Singapore, a global architecture and design practice considered to be within the Top 10 in the world, recently visited Colombo City Centre and met with the promoters of the development.
He also attended the 34th National Conference on Architecture at BMICH Colombo to share his views on the concept of mixed-use developments and why these “cities in the sky” are becoming more prevalent throughout the Asian region.
Simon Griffiths is the visionary behind the structural design of Colombo City Centre, a progressive mixed-use venture by the ABANS Group in collaboration with Silver Needle Hospitality, which will not only redefine the city skyline and urban landscape of Colombo, but also, will be the first ultra modern mixed-use development in Sri Lanka.
Hosting broad design expertise throughout the Asian region, Simon Griffiths has worked on a vast variety of projects including large scale mixed-use ventures, office, hotel, and educational sectors as well as infrastructure projects, particularly, major rail and airport projects in Asia and the Middle East.
His innovative design for the Colombo City Centre project reflects the rich, dynamic culture, history, and colonial heritage of Colombo, placing a contemporary twist on several architectural constructs and forms from the Portuguese, Dutch, and British eras. The building features elegant colonnades with deep eaves along the western face opposite the Beira Lake, which offer respite from Sri Lanka's tropical weather. Large full height windows and doors open to the city, breaking down the barrier between the outdoors and the residential space. This creates a harmonious ground floor transition as well as provides residents an uplifting visual experience of the Beira Lake, Indian Ocean, and brilliant city skyline.
To maintain the lavish natural setting of Colombo City Centre, a series of trees has been retained along Muttiah Road, while alush landscape has been integrated into the structure itself.
Further, the development pays reference to specific aspects of Sri Lankan culture. For instance, the car park screen embodies several influences such as the vibrant colours and weaving of the Sri Lankan textile industry as well as the palm frond walls of traditional dwellings. Colombo City Centre will offer residents the opportunity to partake in a truly enriching high-end lifestyle with its inclusion of an opulent residential complex that will reinvent luxury living in Sri Lanka; a 05-floor retail lifestyle mall that will offer a premium shopping experience, fine dining, a gourmet supermarket, children's play area and more; and Next Hotel, the flagship brand of Silver Needle Hospitality that will utilize a smart approach towards accommodating the needs of professional business travelers.
Simon Griffiths expressed his viewpoint on the location and unique nature of the Colombo City Centre development, remarking that: “Beira Lake is a focus point within Colombo, enriched with cultural events, temples, and history. The development has been designed in such a way as to engage with the future pedestrianized lake side, and allow tourists and locals alike to relax, interact, and admire the amazing sunset views over the lake. The form of the building offers shelter from the elements and the permeable street frontage with al fresco F&B offerings invite and draw people to wander through the multi-levels of retail spaces.”
He further added: “With the introduction of the CCC Mall, it will be one of, if not the largest, international lifestyle mall in Colombo, catering both the tourist and local markets, bringing new brands and entertainment to the city. This will also benefit the residents of the development, as they will have a vibrant hub of dining, 6-screen cinema complex, and marketplace, without having to leave the CCC development.”
