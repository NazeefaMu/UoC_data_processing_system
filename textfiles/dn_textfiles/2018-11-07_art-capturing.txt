Art of capturing

Unlike any other visual image, a photograph is not a rendering, an imitation or an interpretation of its subject, but actually a trace of it. No painting or drawing, however naturalist, belongs to its subject in the way that a photograph does.
You don’t need a camera to take a photograph these days. Most mobile phones come with a camera and a million and one ways to instantly upload and share your work with anyone you choose. The magic of a photograph is somewhat lost when it’s posted on Twitter or Facebook five seconds after it was taken.
Formed in 1950, the National Photographic Art Society of Sri Lanka serves the photographic community in an extraordinary manner. A brainchild of Wilson Hegoda, the Society initially catered to the Sinhala speaking photographer community, and later initiated photography classes not only to its members but also to the students from schools across the country, free; as a community project and then leading on to a recognized Diploma.
The Society’s Education Director, Rahul Perera, shares insights on why photography must be studied as a specialized subject.
Q: Photography is better known as a profession than a subject to be studied.
A: Photography is a practical subject. If someone chooses this subject, they need to deal with the practical as well as the theoretical aspects. But the practical aspect comes with certain issues. The major issue is expenses on one hand. On the other hand, the amateurs do not get an opportunity to get along with the professionals in the field. The phenomenon is different in the global context.
Q: Would you elaborate on the global context?
A: Any amateur is welcome to serve as an assistant in a professional’s studio. But that is not a full-time job. Such jobs are available on a temporary basis. That said, most undergraduates make use of that opportunity, maybe for four hours a day.
Unfortunately, the Sri Lankan undergraduates hardly have an opportunity for part-time employment. The attitude also matters. Most undergraduates are not bothered about a part-time job, because their ambition is simple. Study with parental sponsorship and then apply for some job. On the other hand, many employers are also interested only in recruiting full-time employees.
This situation leaves us with many issues. The amateurs have no funds to invest in relevant equipment. Their only gateway to professionalism is a workshop. I honestly believe that our education system should be revamped with the influence of the global education system.
Q: We are not short of workshops. In fact, many workshops on miscellaneous subjects have mushroomed in the recent future. Your comment?
A: Most of such workshops are professional. The professional workshops have one sole objective: making money. That fee is beyond the financial capacity of an average student or an undergraduate. That is why Sri Lanka National Photographic Art Association has organized a number of workshops at a nominal fee in addition to free seminars. Most workshops are organized at the minimum expenditure. The contribution fee is borne by resource persons. They share their knowledge free of charge.
If we had to pay them as well, we would not be in a position to hold the workshops at a nominal fee. Our resource persons are experts in the field.
Q: The course duration is three years. Organising the whole course is tasked with the second year undergraduates. Why them in particular?
A: The first year undergraduates are clueless about the subject. They are not empowered with any experience either. The third-year students are busy preparing for the dissertation. So the second year is a relatively free year. So they are in a comfortable position to organize a workshop of this nature during the second year. They provide an opportunity for the first year students to get an idea. But the priority is given to the first year students.
Q: The Diploma duration is three years. How do you guarantee the knowledge capacity within that period?
A: The first year student is introduced to the fundamental theories and history of photography. Approaching the second year, they are well positioned to identify a photograph in a specialized manner. The second year is allocated to a more practical purpose. They come to terms with the theoretical knowledge they received during the first year. The third year is beyond both theory and practice. They need to choose their journey: whether it is artistic, commercial or professional.
Q: The first year students may be clueless. But there could be students with a considerable knowledge. All of them have to sit together and study? Isn’t it unfair to a certain extent?
A: Of course yes. However, remember this is carried out free of charge on a voluntary basis. Something free of charge on a voluntary basis is no piece of cake in an economic situation such as what we have right now. We need to find teachers. We need to find resource persons.
If we have to think about the two categories that you mentioned, then we have to double up our search. That is beyond the capacity for a voluntary organization.
On the other hand, it is good that these two categories get along with each other. The clueless students can take some clue from their more literate peers.
