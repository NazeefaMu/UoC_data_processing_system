Maersk Line is profitable again

Danish container shipping major Maersk Line returned to profit, CEO of A.P. Møller – Mærsk A/S, Søren Skou, said announcing the group’s results for the second quarter of 2017.
“Maersk Line is again profitable delivering in line with guidance, with revenue growing by USD 1bn year-on-year in the second quarter. The profit was USD 490 million higher than the same quarter last year, based on higher rates,” Skou said.
The company reported a profit of USD 339 million for the second quarter of 2017, against a loss of USD 151 million in the second quarter of 2016 with a positive ROIC of 6.7%, which bounced back from negative RIOC of 3.0%.The underlying result was a profit of USD 327 million, also a major return from a loss of USD 139 million booked in the corresponding period a year ago.Improved results were ascribed to a recovery of market fundamentals during the quarter as demand growth of 4% outgrew nominal supply growth of 1.4%.
Maersk said that the improvement has led to 22 % higher freight rates compared to Q2 2016 and 7.6% compared to Q1 2017. Specifically, freight rates rose by 36% on East-West trades and 17% on North South trades.
As disclosed, global demand for seaborne container transportation is still expected to increase 2-4%, but in the upper end of the range. World Maritime News
