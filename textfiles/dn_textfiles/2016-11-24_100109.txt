Smith upbeat over  start-from-scratch Aussies

 
ADELAIDE, Wednesday – Skipper Steve Smith on Wednesday insisted he was excited rather than daunted as a drastically reshaped Australia look to avoid their first ever home Test series whitewash against rampant South Africa.
Australia’s cull after two Test thrashings has extended to five changes to the starting team for the day-night third Test in Adelaide, including three debutants.
But Smith was upbeat about the changes, which include English-born opener Matt Renshaw and fellow newcomers Peter Handscomb and Nic Maddinson. “I’m really excited. I think it’s a great opportunity for me to stamp my authority on this team as the leader,” Smith said ahead of the first day on Thursday.
“I’ve almost felt a little shift over the last couple of days in attitude and energy from what the new guys have brought in.
“I know that growth doesn’t happen overnight, so it could take some time, but I am confident that with the guys we have here that we can start turning our results around straight away and start playing the way we want to play.” AFP
