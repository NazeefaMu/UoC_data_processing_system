If there was an auction in Test cricket:
Five players who could get the highest bid

The IPL auction has always been a fascinating event in the cricketing calendar. Over the years, lots of unknown players have become overnight superstars by fetching big bucks for the auction. Since the IPL auction is meant for T20 cricket, it is sad to see a lot of veteran players who have played for their sides for years in Tests but not particularly suited for T20 format get ignored.
Let us assume a hypothetical situation of an auction being conducted for Test cricket on Indian pitches.
If it were to happen, it would be a different ball game altogether! Even though many of the players from the IPL would still fetch a decent amount at this ‘Test’ auction, few will be left out and many seasoned Test cricket campaigners will attract huge bids. Here is a look at 5 players who would rock the auction if it were meant for Test cricket. Note: It is assumed that the players are up for grabs at the auction for an IPL-like Test tournament meant to be played in India. - SK
DALE STEYN
On his day, Steyn can destroy any batting line-up with his devasting pace
With 86 Tests and 419 wickets, the Phalaborwa-born pacer is arguably the best fast bowler in the modern era.
He is on the brink of breaking Shaun Pollock’s record of most Test wickets by a South African fast bowler.
His ability to rattle batsmen with sheer pace is second to none. Other than that, he is a very good exponent of outswing as well. Steyn is a kind of bowler who does not need conditions to aid him. Not only he is devastating on juicy pitches at Durban and Cape Town, but on subcontinent pitches too, Steyn’s record has been impressive.
T20 may not be his preferred format, but if Steyn goes under hammer for a Test auction, he will have dollars raining all over him.
 
NATHAN LYON
Nathan Lyon has been the best off-spinner for Australia in their history of Test cricket
Nathan Lyon is the best off-spinner Australia have had in their 140-odd years of Test cricket. The New South Wales off-spinner has the ability to play both, the aggressive and defensive game with the ball.
On a pitch which does not have a lot of turn and bounce to offer, Lyon is quite happy to play the second fiddle to the fast bowlers. But come the turning tracks, he is as deadly as any! After almost 75 Tests, Lyon is closing in on 300 Test scalps. He will be the first Australian off-spinner to get there.
If Lyon’s name comes up at the auction, teams will not mind spending a big chunk of their purse, since by doing so they can feel assured about having a quality spinner in their ranks.
RANGANA HERATH
Crafty spinner Rangana Herath is Sri Lanka’s second-best spinner after Muralitharan.
The Sri Lankan spin wizard has been the pillar of the spin department ever since the retirement of the great Muttiah Muralitharan. For several years, Herath remained under the shadow of Muttiah Muralitharan. It was only in his 30s and after the retirement of Murali that Herath started to blossom at Test level.
With 415 wickets from 89 Tests, Herath has the most wickets by any left-arm bowler in Test cricket.
His orthodox style of bowling is not suited much for the abbreviated formats of the game. But in Test cricket, very few can beat Herath in perseverance.
Arguably one of the greatest spinners of contemporary times, Herath would certainly be a worthy inclusion on the list of million-dollar boys.
CHETESHWAR PUJARA
Pujara is India’s new ‘Wall’ at No.3 after Rahul Dravid
This is not an exaggeration. You would put your money, property and everything to have a batsman like Cheteshwar Pujara in your side.
Very few batsmen show as much resilience as Pujara does when he is at the crease. Unlike many modern-day players, Pujara doesn’t have a wide range of innovative shots and the power which are the basic ingredients in T20 cricket. Hence, Pujara is overlooked in this format of the game because of his low strike rate. But, he sure does have all the essentials of Test-match batting like patience, solid technique and ability to wear bowlers down. He is best equipped to weather all kinds of bowlers on any pitch.
If there were a Test auction, word would be spare 10 crores for this guy!
ALASTAIR COOK
Alastair Cook has been Englamd’s numero uno at the top of the order for the past ten years.
Alastair Cook’s ODI numbers are unimpressive and T20I figures are dismal. But come Test cricket, the Essex opener is not only a cook, but the ‘chef’ in all conditions.
12000 runs from 152 Tests with 32 centuries just don’t come so easily to anyone. Cook’s biggest strength is the ability to score daddy hundreds without breaking a sweat. This is evident from the fact that he has 11 scores of 150+ at Test level including 5 double hundreds.
If he was up for grabs, Cook would surely grab the eyeballs of spendthrifts, for he is an invaluable asset at the top of the order and perhaps the only one in modern day cricket who is looked upon breaking Sachin Tendulkar’s record.
