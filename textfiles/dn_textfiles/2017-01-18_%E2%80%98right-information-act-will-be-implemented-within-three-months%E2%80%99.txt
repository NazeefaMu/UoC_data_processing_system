‘Right to Information Act will be implemented within three months’

The Right to Information Act will be implemented within three months after gazetting it on February 3, Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Minister Gayantha Karunatileka said addressing an awareness programme on the Right to Information Act at Tangalle Saman hotel.
He said information officials were appointed for 50 institutions and only two institutions remain to be appointed with officials. The minister said police station can manage without an information official since OICs will be appointed for the post. The Right to Information Act will help journalists immensely to carry out their duties.
Media villages will be set up in each district to provide housing facilities to provincial journalists at a subsidy rate, he said. A land in Colombo was identified to set up a housing complex for journalists in the Colombo district. He said a land belonging to the SLBC was selected, but it was found later that its ownership had changed unknown to the SLBC.
Twenty five houses will be set up in each media village at the initial stage, and Housing Minister Sajith Premadasa extended his and his ministry fullest co-operation towards this worthy task, the minister said. Some people misunderstand that the media persons are only those who reside in Colombo. Provincial journalists too report many important incidents and when new identity cards are issued, they do not get due recognition, he said.
