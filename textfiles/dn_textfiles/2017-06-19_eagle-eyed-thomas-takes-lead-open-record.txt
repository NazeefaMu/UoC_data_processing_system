Eagle-eyed Thomas takes lead with Open record

ERIN, United States, Saturday – Justin Thomas electrified the US Open with the lowest score to par in tournament history to take a two-shot lead on Saturday.
The 24-year-old world number 13 sank a magnificent eagle three on the par-five 18th hole to crown a sparkling nine-under-par 63 at the Erin Hills course in Wisconsin.
The score was the lowest to par ever set at a US Open, breaking the previous mark of eight-under-par. Thomas’s incredible round included nine birdies and an eagle, and might have been even better had it not been for two bogeys on the fourth and 10th hole. His eagle on the last came after a superb second shot of 300 yards which left him just six feet from the hole.
He then held his nerve to roll in a putt which enabled him to break free from the top of crowded leaderboard.
Two players, Charley Hoffman and England’s Tommy Fleetwood, were behind him on nine under, while a cluster of four players were three back on eight under. - AFP
