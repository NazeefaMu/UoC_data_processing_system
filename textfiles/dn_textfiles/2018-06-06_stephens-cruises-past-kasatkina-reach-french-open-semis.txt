Stephens cruises past Kasatkina to reach French Open semis

PARIS Tuesday: US Open champion Sloane Stephens brushed aside Russian 14th seed Daria Kasatkina to book her spot in a maiden French Open semi-final on Tuesday.
The 10th seed produced a clinical performance to down Kasatkina, the conqueror of world number two Caroline Wozniacki, 6-3, 6-1 on Court Philippe Chatrier.
She will next face fellow American and good friend Madison Keys in a repeat of last year’s final in New York, after the 13th seed saw off Kazakhstan’s Yulia Putintseva 7-6 (7/5), 6-4. - AFP
