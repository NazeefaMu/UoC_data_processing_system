Reforming the Police

The Police have come in for a lot of flak from all levels of society and it is generally accepted that the Police force should undergo a vital transformation. There have been many suggestions that the Government should seek foreign expertise in this regard. The Government seems to have taken cognizance of this view as Sri Lanka Police is to undergo extensive reforms next year under the guidance of top international Police consultant Sir Hugh Orde.
The Sri Lankan Government has sought the assistance of the British expert to introduce reforms on a wide range of areas, including intelligence, training, best practices, equipment, hardware and software, according to a report published in our sister newspaper The Sunday Observer yesterday.
The former President of the Association of Chief Police Officers in the United Kingdom, Sir Orde on a five-day official visit to Sri Lanka last week, met with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Minister of Law and Order, Sagala Ratnayaka and a number of parties committed to the reforms process.
Sir Orde is expected to submit a report on his initial observations to Minister Ratnayaka on his return to the United Kingdom.
Sir Orde is due to visit Sri Lanka three times next year.
According to him, a real action plan can only be expected following the third visit after a thorough study of the Police force is conducted.
Sir Orde is also expected to address issues such as gender discrimination, Police torture, eliminating corruption and depoliticizing the Force during the process, while presenting proposals to modernize it. As he points out, it is not a process that can be done overnight and time is needed.
He has emphasized the need for the public to give the Force a chance to prove that it means to transform itself, while the Police also will need to communicate to its staff and public about the reform process. In other words, it should be an open, transparent process.
With the end of the war, military intelligence has taken a backseat and the police had to rise to the challenge of gathering intelligence on organised crime, narcotics smuggling, transnational crime, illegal migration etc. There have been some successes in this sphere, but better intelligence could have enabled the Police to do much more to combat such crimes. Intelligence sharing with regional police forces must be improved to tackle transnational crime.
While there had been a 30 percent reduction in major crimes in recent years, much more has to be done. There had been an upswing in crime in the North as it has returned to normality, mainly because of the activities of factions of former armed groups. In fact, the Police have to address the problem of the wide circulation of illegal small arms island-wide. The Police anti-narcotics units must also be strengthened as there is a dangerous trend of increased narcotics offences.
Ensuring road discipline is part and parcel of the duty of Police, but sometimes there is a feeling that the Police are using the majority of its resources for this alone. If you travel along any of the major roads leading to Colombo on a weekday, you will see an alarmingly high number of policemen at every junction, every pedestrian crossing and sometimes even by the roadside. Worse, some traffic policemen turn the signal lights off and manually control the traffic. This is an unmitigated disaster every time. Traffic lights have been designed to ensure the maximum flow of traffic according to set times of the day. They never get hungry, angry, bored, distracted, tired or emotional. It is just not a task that a lone policeman can perform at a busy junction even for one hour. Police must not be allowed to turn the traffic lights off and direct traffic by hand at any time of the day, except in an emergency. Police must also give up the practice of hiding behind trees to nab errant motorists. Police must be out in the open, which is much more likely to drive fear into offending motorists.
Police, especially the traffic police, will have to shed the image of corruption. We hope that a portion from the higher fines imposed recently would go to the police personnel, as in the case of the Customs Department.
Modernizing the police force is essential. Some of the vehicles used by certain police stations are 20 to 30- years-old and are not suitable for pursuit of criminals. Police vehicles in many countries are now equipped with computers which can access criminal databases on the move. The same goes for facilities such as walkie talkies and communications equipment which have to be upgraded. The lock up facilities in many police stations are in a deplorable state and all suspects have to be treated fairly until they are produced in a court of law.
There are many aspects of reforming the Police service that Sir Orde, the National Police Commission, the Law and Order Ministry and other relevant agencies have to look into. A dynamic new police force is essential for our forward march.
