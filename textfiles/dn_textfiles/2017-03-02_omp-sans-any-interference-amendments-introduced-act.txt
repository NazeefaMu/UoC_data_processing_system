OMP sans any interference: Amendments introduced to the Act

 The government will set up the Office of the Missing Persons (OMP) without any international interference, Co-Cabinet Spokesperson, Minister Rajitha Senaratne said yesterday, as Cabinet approved amendments to the OMP Act to delete paragraph (a) of Section 11 of the Act.
The minister was addressing the weekly Cabinet briefing at the Department of Government Information.
The section authorised the Office to enter into agreements with an individual or an organisation in performing its tasks.
Earlier this month, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe sought Cabinet approval to have the Legal Draftsman and Attorney General have a look at preparing amendments which would do away with the troublesome section.
The Prime Minister in his proposal this week also pointed out that JVP MP Bimal Ratnayake had also proposed that paragraph (a) of Section 11 which allows it to enter into agreements with any person or organisation be removed.
The amendments are expected to be submitted to Parliament soon for approval. The international community and the Tamil National Alliance in the meantime has called for international involvement in the process in order to ensure its credibility and effectiveness.
