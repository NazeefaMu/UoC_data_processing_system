Government to move on polythene management

 
The Cabinet approved a proposal brought forward by President Maithripala Sirisena today, to implement short-term, medium-term and long-term strategies to manage the use of polythene and minimize its environmental impact.
The short-term measures to reduce the accumulation of non-degradable items, recommended by a Committee appointed by the President, include the following:
Prohibition of polythene for decoration
Implementing prevailing regulations for prohibition of use, sale and production of polythene of more than 20 microns
Allow the use of polythene less than 20 microns for essential activities only, on the approval of the Central Environment Authority (CEA) Prohibition of sale, importation and production of lunch sheets
Prohibition of sale importation and production of containers, plates, cups and spoons made using polystyrene
Prohibition of sale of processed or cooked meals packed in polythene containers
Promotion of providing paper, cloth or reed bags or biologically degradable plastics for customers purchasing items from a store
Prohibition of burning polythene and plastic in open places
Introduction and promotion of biologically degradable polythene and plastics
As mid-term measures the committee proposed the provision of tax concessions on the importation of machinery used in biologically degradable plastic production and imposing a cess tax of 15% on the importation of plastic raw material.
The long-term goal, as envisaged by the committee, is to completely prohibit recycled plastic products.
