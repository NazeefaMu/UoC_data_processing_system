High Altitude Sports Complex for Nuwara Eliya

The agreement for the construction of Nuwara Eliya High Altitude Sports Complex was signed yesterday between secretary of the sports ministry Dr. D. M. R. B. Dissanayake and Chairman of Ellips Projects of Prance Picard Oliver at the auditorium of the sports ministry in the presence of Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera and Deputy Minister H. M. Harees
Approval for the project has been given by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe
It is expected to construct the proposed high altitude sports complex, on a land of 34.5 ht. In extent, located in the City of Nuwara Eliya. A height of 1500-3500 metres (above sea level) is required to build a high-altitude sports ground. . The land on which the proposed high altitude sports ground lies at an altitude of 1895 metres (above sea level).
A high Altitude environment increases the power of endurance in sports persons. Therefore this venue would in particular, increase the power of endurance among those who are engaged in athletics while the sportsmen and women engaged in sports such as Kabadi, Netball, Hockey, Swimming, Cycling, Rugger and Volleyball would find this place an ideal venue. They can also enhance their capacity of endurance. Generally a successful training requires 3 to 6 weeks and when it comes to such training in China or Japan costs 10,000 – 25,000US$, whereas this cost is 8,500US$, here in Sri Lanka, which would be adequate to cover the cost of training in several sports and on the other hand it would be adequate to cover the cost of training in several sports and on the other hand it would save foreign exchange. We will be able to earn foreign exchange by training athletes.
Not only that, this would cater to the need of an International High Altitude Sports Training Centre for the sake of the athletes in neighbouring countries as well. This position will be ideal for foreigners since they can experience the vividness of the weather within a time as short as 24 hours on the other hand it would as pave way for direct and indirect economic benefits such as generating new sources of income to the economy, employment opportunities to those who are engaged in the field of sports providing short-term job opportunities for people for developing our sports economy.
The estimate cost of this project will be 75,528,700.91 EUROS and they have informed that 100% of this amount would be provided through HSBC by the Ellips Projects SAS. (70% as a foreign loan and 30% as a local loan)
