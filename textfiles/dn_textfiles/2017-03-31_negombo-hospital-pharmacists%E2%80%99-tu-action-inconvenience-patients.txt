Negombo Hospital pharmacists’ TU action inconvenience patients

Outdoor patients seeking treatment at the Negombo Hospital faced many inconveniences due to a trade union action launched by the pharmacists.
The pharmacists refrained from issuing drugs prescribed by the doctors to OPD patients in protest of the recruiting of four dispensers to the hospital. However, Hospital Directress Dr Nilanthi Pathirana said that patients were issued drugs after breaking open the drug dispensing unit.
