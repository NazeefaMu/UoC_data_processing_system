Havies field a young and talented side this season

Havelock Sports Club founded in 1915 is a Division ‘A’ rugby union team based in Sri Lanka that plays in the Dialog Rugby League.
The Club has a long history and Rugby is the club’s main sporting activity. The “Havies”, as they are commonly known amongst its members, is situated in Colombo and the club’s ground is known as Havelock Park. The club has produced some excellent players over the last few decades including players of the calibre of fierce tackler cum third row forward Angelo Wickramaratne, Michael Jayasekera, Hisham Abdeen, Marco De Silva, Bharatha Mendis, Graham Raux, Sanjeewa Jayasinghe, Rajeev Ganapathy and Kavinda Jayasena to name a few. The club has struggled over the last decade to retain its players with their star performer’s crossing over to more star-powered clubs.
They were ones down and out even to find 15 players to represent the club rugby side but Stormed in to recognition in 2012/13 season with the help of several ex CR and FC players together with the guidance of knowledgeable Samoan coach TevitaTulagaise affectionately called Laga by all his close friends by winning the coveted league Crown under prop forward Terrence Henry after a lapse of almost close to four decades.
They beat the defending champions at that time the formidable Kandy Sports Club, who were the champions for the preceding 10 years. The brain child behind this famous victory is none-other than ex CR and FC stalwart Asanga Seneviratne who suddenly took over Havies that year and within the period of three to four months transformed a ordinary bunch of players to a fighting unit, capable of giving a fight to other top clubs such as CR and FC, Navy and Kandy by being a dominant force in the local rugby arena.
Seneviratne, who is the current head of the Sri Lanka Rugby, has changed the face of Havies Rugby over the last several years by helping them find sponsors through companies he controls, which has helped lift the standards of the club on-field and off-field. A new stadium has been built with games being played under lights.
Sri Lankan national prop/second row forward Jason Melder will captain the Havelock SC in the 2017/18 season in the Dialog league rugby tournament and the Clifford cup knock out championship.
Also the club has drafted in Sanath Martis as the head coach of the team this year’s rugby season.
Prop forward Ashan Darling has left the club and joined Kandy SC this season.
There’s a good news for Havies as former club captain cum national winger Sadun Herath has returned to play for them this season along with some newcomers in experience Sri Lanka full back Reeza Mubarak, Peterite Prop/ Second Row forward Rahal Delpachitra, Pathana fly half Randy Silva, Joes third row forward Gihan Perera and Wing three quarter Sachith Silva along with St.Anthony’s college Kandy this year’s captain cum cracking centre Dinuk Amerasinghe and Royal college hooker Azmir Fajudeen has joined the club and will most probably play for the pink and chocolate Jerseyed lad this season.
