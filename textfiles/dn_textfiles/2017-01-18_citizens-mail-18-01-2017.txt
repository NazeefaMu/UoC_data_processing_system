[CITIZENS' Mail - (18-01-2017)]

A letter most welcome
As a person who knows and understands the value of the postal service and the post offices in Sri Lanka, I highly appreciate and felt much happy about ‘A letter to you from the Post Master General’ delivered to every house by the postmen on January 1 this year.
Almost all the governmental and public institutes especially, post offices, schools, temples, ministries, and educational offices have totally ‘collapsed’ and deteriorated due to inefficiency, corruption and malpractices, committed by some officials and clerks employed there.
For example, how many times will a person who goes to a police station to get something done, have to keep waiting, killing much of the valuable time, until his or her job is attended to?
How many times will a teacher who goes to an educational office have to wait until the necessary clerk attends to his or her work?
I do suggest that all the ministry heads, department heads, principals, and chief incumbents (at temples) should take this letter as an example and think of their weaknesses, insufficient workers and try their level best to make each of their institute more ‘people-friendly' and more and more attractive so that a better and much efficient public service (corruption free) is rendered to the general public.
