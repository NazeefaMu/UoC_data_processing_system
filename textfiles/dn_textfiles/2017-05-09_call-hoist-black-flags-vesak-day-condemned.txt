Call to hoist black flags on Vesak Day condemned

Members of the Joint Opposition who are trying to grab votes by spreading false rumours about the proposed new Constitution alleging that it would deny Buddhism its prominent place have displayed their own anti-Buddhist stance by trying to instigate people to hoist black flags instead of Buddhist flags on Vesak Poya day, said Ven. Bendiwewa Diyasena Thera, the General Secretary of Aryange Ekamuthuwa organisation. Ven. Diyasena Thera said he was anxious to know the opinion of Mahinda Rajapaksa about this movement to hoist black flags as Rajapaksa gave unofficial leadership to the Joint Opposition while standing for the Sinhala nation and Buddhism. Ven. Diyasena said Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Sri Lanka to grace the UN Vesak Day celebrations was a victory we have achieved as a nation. This showed that political Lilliputians were trying to challenge the Gulliver s in today's politics in order to increase their vote bank by deceiving the people.
Holding of UN Vesak Day celebrations in Sri Lanka was itself a victory achieved by Sri Lanka internationally.
Attempts made to utilise the thrice blessed day for for Buddhists for political gain, displayed the bankruptcy of defeated politicians.
