IGP told to cooperate with AG

Court of Appeal Justice (President) Vijith K. Malalgoda yesterday directed IGP N.K. Ilangakoon to cooperate with the Attorney General whenever police officers were noticed to appear before Court.
Justice Malalgoda made this directive when the four Habeas Corpus petitions filed by wives of four Army intelligence officers arrested and detained in connection with the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda were taken up for hearing before the Court of Appeal yesterday.
The Court also ordered the respondents to file objection on November 19.
At a previous occasion too, court re-issued notices on four respondents including the IGP to appear before Court to show cause as to why they did not appear before court.
Meanwhile, Counsel Chishmal Warnasuriya appearing on behalf of the family members of Ekneligoda requested that Sandya Ekaneligoda be permitted to intervene into the petitions. The Court observed that this application would be considered to support on the next date. In the petitions, four wives of the detained Army intelligence officers - N. Sudharshi, P.N. Samanthi, L.D. Jayasekara and M. Karunaratne sought an order directing the respondents to produce their detained husbands in court and release them.
The petitioners stated the respondents had made arrangements and had obtained a Detention Order to detain Corporal Anura Jayalath, Staff Sergeant R.M. Priyantha, Lt. Colonel S.A. Kumararatne and Lt. T.T. Prabodha under section 9(1) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act No. 48 of 1979.
The petitioners stated that Ekneligoda had gone missing since 2010. They stated that in 2010, a Habeas Corpus application had been filed in the Court of Appeal and directed the Homagama magistrate to expedite an inquiry in this regard.
The petitioner stated that a copy of the detention order has not been furnished up to now.
They further stated that the initial detention order issued on August 27, 2015 lapsed on September 10 2015 and the petitioner stated that they learnt that a further detention order has been issued by the Defence Ministry Secretary detaining the Army personnel for a further period of 14 days.
They stated that the arrest of their husbands allegedly for purported involvement regarding the incident pertaining to Eknaligoda is illegal, unlawful, contrary to law, wrong, erroneous and bad in law in as much the evidence in MC Homagama does not reflect any incriminatory material against the detainees.
They alleged that the arrest of the army personnel is contrary to law and that in arresting them for an offence under the PTA, the first and second respondents have violated and infringed the Fundamental Rights guaranteed to them under Article 13(1) of the constitution.
They stated that the Army personnel were not produced within 24 hours of their arrest before a Magistrate and they continue to be in detention up to date.
They pleaded that in view of the fact that the allegations contained in this application clearly demonstrate a prima facia infringement of articles 12(1), 12(2), 13(1), 13(2) of the constitution relating to the detainees and refer this application for determination by the Supreme Court.
