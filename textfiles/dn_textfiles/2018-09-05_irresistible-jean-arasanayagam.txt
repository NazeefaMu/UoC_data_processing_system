Irresistible Jean Arasanayagam

Jean Arasanayagam is irresistible. She continues to publish many volumes of her longish poems which carry her persona and literary embellishments. Right now, she dominates the Lankan poetic scene in English winning prizes one after the other, which is a positive thing indeed.
One of her books is- ‘Introspection Poems’ published by Sarasavi Publishers in 2016 and is priced Rs 350/-It has 43 poems within its 138 pages. From some of her titles you would know what her fanciful themes are.
A few titles: Mindscapes, Dreams and Poetry, Metaphysical, The Voice Within, Embryonic thoughts, Invisible Mirrors, Introspection.
Let’s take ‘Introspection’. What does it say? A wanderer through the wilderness continues her journey and reach a mirage-filled horizon searching for through her harsh passage. Right. But what is the outcome?
Look, how she concludes the journey in her last stanza:
” I am not blameless, I walked blindly into danger-zones, I did not baulk at trepidatious confrontation nor dodge my assailants but willingly allowed myself to be captive to forces that curbed my resistless powerless being until I found those secret bypaths that led me out of that crushing wilderness inhabited by the assassin and torturers, untangling those snarled- up routes, separating their diverse strands like wayward thoughts that wait to be unknotted, straightened out”
So, it is fantasy experienced through travelling though tortuous routes.
What is significant in most of her poetry is her mastery of the vocabulary. Her unusual coinages are fascinating. Long winded lines may tire the reader, but read aloud, the lines are rhythmic and poetic.
To enjoy her poetry, one must read her poems in full.
Some lines I enjoyed reading aloud:
On Admired, Jean’s opening line is as follows---“Great Chasms divide us fissured by time and age.”
I wish to give in full her poem titled “Mindscapes” for you to enjoy it yourself, even though the first stanza is only one amalgamated sentence.
“My mind unwinds reel after reel of images, landscapes that are now embedded in each vast unending scape with its recurrent visions, unwind those reels in my dreams and waking hours, reflecting my passage through the convoluted passages of history, merging into the uptodate routs of the contemporary times I take, thronged with repetitiousness of everyday life, of birth, of death with familiar landmarks and signposts, the totems of ravaged civilizations, bombed churches, roofless abodes, mined wastelands, jagged crests of withering palm friends.
Villas, deserted, abandoned, inhabited by spectres that roam lost and desolate from room to room, tree roots growing into cracked walls fissured with windows gaping wide, gardens with empty bunkers into which reptiles coil and nestle in darkness, everything gone to seed, except for rampant weeds clinging to the parched earth, door less apertures, empty spaces, in uninhibited rooms, ruined homes to which there will never be a return.
My mind unwinds reel after reel…”
One more poem in full – “Dreams and Poetry”
“A flash of insight, a piercing light illuminates the inner darkness that oppresses the sleeping spirit, rouses it to awakening creates transient images that ripple and quiver in the mind, summoning the hidden visions all expectant from their dormant slumber, to emerge,
Tantalize the imagination with unfolding panorama of representative lives, multiplying in gestation after gestation of phenomenal beings appearing from the closed in inner chambers with whom I engage in fleeting dialogues,
Beings, real or phantasy embodiments, encountered on my reincarnatory passages through aeons of rebirth, some of them still alive in memory but who no longer tread this earth,
We meet at crossroads or veer off, take different routes, I return alone, take a few, tentative steps in my halting gait wearied after so many ruminative journeys, often directionless, step back into a precarious reality, my visions growing diffuse, a fast vanishing world of dreams with their intimations of another lie, another hidden existence in those timeless spaces wit their glimpses of eternity.”
Personally, I like to write simple sentences that are short but with appropriate right words, but the poets and writers in English are used to write long sentences maybe because they want all what they want to express in one breath.
However, I tried to understand what our poet wants to say in her poems, even when I did not readily understand some of the unfamiliar words.
Students of higher forms can learn a lot by reading such poets and writers in Lanka.
