Sri Lanka’s suicide rate up

About 14 or 15 persons in every 100,000 Sri Lankans commit suicide, Consultant Psychiatrist Dr. Thilini Rajapaksha said.
Addressing a seminar at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo yesterday, she said in 1997, Sri Lanka became the first country relating to suicides. About 47 in every 100,000 persons committed suicide. In 1995, Sri Lanka had the world's second highest suicide rate. But in 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, only five or 10 Sri Lankans committed suicide.
According to Dr. Rajapaksha, the majority of the suicide victims are young males bellow the age of 30. Most of them are between the ages of 15 and 24.
"It is women who try to commit suicide more than men. Many of them end in hospital beds receiving treatment," she said.
Depression and disorders caused by the use of alcohol are two main factors that encourage suicides. Most young people commit suicide due to difficulty of tolerating distress associated with an interpersonal conflict, she said.
Most adults commit suicide due to depression, Rajapaksha said.
