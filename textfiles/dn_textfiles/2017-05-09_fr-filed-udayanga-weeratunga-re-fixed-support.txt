At a previous occasion, the Attorney General was given further time to seek possibility of releasing funds from several frozen bank accounts belonging to Udayanga Weeratunga following his request to do so.
On October 20 last year, the Colombo Fort Magistrate had issued a warrant written in English through the Interpol for the arrest of UdayangaWeeratunga, a first cousin of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, over alleged financial fraud that is alleged to have taken place in procuring seven MiG-27 ground attack crafts for the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLFA).

The petitioner further sought an Interim Order restraining the Director of the Financial Intelligence Unit of the Central Bank from suspending the petitioner’s bank accounts and continuing to suspend the bank accounts.
The petitioner stated that the seventh respondent, a Chief Inspector of the FCID had moved Magistrate’s Court for a warrant for the arrest of the petitioner.
The petitioner sought a declaration from the Court that the Chief Inspector infringed the petitioner’s Fundamental Rights guaranteed in terms of Articles 11, 12(1) and 13 of the Constitution.

In his complaint to the FCID, journalist Iqbal Athas stated that he had written several articles regarding the financial irregularities that had taken place in procuring four Mig-27 aircrafts at a higher price. He told the police that these ground attack aircrafts had been manufactured between 1980 and 1983.
