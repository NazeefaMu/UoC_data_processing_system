Japanese funds for humanitarian demining of  Northern Sri Lanka

The Government of Japan would provide US$ 1,263,112 approximately Rs. 190 million for the humanitarian demining of Northern Sri Lanka. The recipients of the grant are the SKAVITA Humanitarian Assistance and Relief Project (SHARP) and the HALO Trust, a local NGO and an international NGO, respectively.
The grant contract was signed at the Japanese Embassy on Tuesday, by Japanese Ambassador Kenichi Suganuma, Lt. Col. V.S.M. Jayawardena of SHARP and Ms. Fiona Kilpatrick of HALO Trust. The Japanese Government has since 2003, been a major donor toward mine-clearing efforts in Sri Lanka, donating approximately US$ 31.3 million so far.
Ambassador Suganuma, Jayawardena and Kilpatrick emphasized that Japanese commitment to demining would pave way to achieve the goal of a mine-free Sri Lanka by the year 2020. Kilpatrick added that such a commitment had enabled our organization to continue the clearance of the highest priority minefields in the country.
“This saves lives, enables resettlement and reconstruction of critical infrastructure and facilitates the resumption of the livelihoods of thousands,” Kilpatrick said.
She ended by noting that the Japanese funding the demining of Sri Lanka, have, in 2017 alone, allowed her team at the HALO Trust to demine nearly 2,000 mines and other explosive items from over 20 hectare of land in the North.
