Youth aware that their welfare depends on UNP: Mangala

Youth are attending United National Party (UNP) election meetings in ever-increasing numbers, as they are well aware that their future welfare depends on the UNP.
Candidates contesting the local government election under the Pohottuwa symbol are similar to the saying, old wine in a new bottle, for they represent a band of thieves who plundered public assets. They return to feed their greed, rather than to develop the villages, Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
The Minister was addressing a UNP rally held at Hittetiya West in support of party candidates contesting the Matara Municipal Council Elections. Minister Samaraweera said the country's economy has showed signs of progress under the tenure of the present government. The country's primary account had shown an excess for the first time its history since the late Sir John Kotelawala period of rule. The opposition, which was smarting under this situation, was making false charges against it to deceive the masses and obstruct its forward march.
Samaraweera said the forthcoming local government election was an election aimed at building and developing villages and towns, rather than changing governments. It is by electing UNP candidates that people could expect a worthwhile service to their areas through their respective municipal councils. The people could repose their faith in UNP candidates, as they belonged to a clean, disciplined and unblemished team.
Former Matara district Parliamentarian H R Wimalasiri, former Mayor of Matara Upul Nishantha and several others also spoke. A group of more than 20 Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) youth supporters greeted Minister Samaraweera with sheaves of betel and joined the UNP to lend their support to the party at the forthcoming election.
