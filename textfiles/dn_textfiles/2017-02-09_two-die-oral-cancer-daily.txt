Two die of oral cancer daily

Two or three persons die of oral cancer in Sri Lanka daily.Fifteen percent (15%) of the total number of cancers detected in Sri Lanka is oral cancers, Acting Health Services Director General Dr.Jayasundara Bandara said.
According to Dr. Bandara,Oral and Maxillo-Facial Surgeries have achieved a great advancement during the past years and now facilities are available at the newly opened National Dental Teaching Hospital for such surgeries. Even the scar of the surgery can be removed with the latest laser treatment. He expressed these views during a press briefing held in Colombo to mark the International Dental and Maxillofacial Surgeons’ Day falls on February 13th. Dr. Bandara pointed out that presently the Government spends around 3.2 percent from the GDP on the health sector and there are over 25 clinics available countrywide to offer advanced dental treatment to the public. The Government does not limit the funds when it comes to offering medical treatment to the public.
“The media has a responsibility to educate the public on available free advanced dental treatment. The doctors attached to state hospitals should treat journalists well in order to maintain a healthy relationship which will benefit both parties. Media should be handled carefully like the way we handle a serpent. The serpent bites only when we hurt it. It does not bite when caught from the head,” he added.
