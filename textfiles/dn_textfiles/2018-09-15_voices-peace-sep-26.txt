Voices of Peace on Sep 26

Researcher and author Sarah Kabir will launch ‘Voices of Peace’- a book about experiences and stories of combatants, on September 26 at 5.30 pm at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute.
Voices of Peace shares the stories of 10 former LTTE cadres and 10 Sri Lankan Military personnel who were each actively engaged in the conflict providing a cathartic platform for these unheard voices to share their stories and provide readers with an objective and compassionate window into the protracted conflict.
The author with the book encourages empathy, meaningful public discussion and the continuation of dialogue between individuals, communities, and the nation as a whole to positively influence national policy on peace and reconciliation.
Dr. Vinya Ariyaratne, Dr. Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, Aaranya Rajasingam and Saliya Pieris PC will participate in a discussion on acknowledging the experience and plight of these individuals as well as on broader themes of peace and national reconciliation in a post-conflict Sri Lanka. The discussion will be moderated by Executive Director at National Peace Council of Sri Lanka,Dr. Jehan Perera.
