‘KDU Act to hinder postgraduate employment’

The proposed General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University Act (drafted in 2017) which was planned to be brought to Parliament soon, would hinder postgraduate employment of Sri Lanka<U+200B>n youth, State Medical Students’ Parents’ Union Media Spokesman Wasantha Alwis said.
Addressing a press conference held at the Organisation of Professionals Association (OPA) building in Colombo, yesterday evening, he said the act, which would be introduced by the Defence Ministry, would welcome substandard degrees to the country’s education system. It would also overpower the Sri Lanka Medical Council and all similar professional regulatory bodies.
According to Alwis, if the said act is passed in Parliament, students from international schools including SAITM admitted to the Kotelawala Defence University, could easily find employment, while state university students would still be continuing their studies.
The Union would not let this happen; it would firm unions of all parents including schoolchildren, he added.
