‘CEB will protest against SAITM’

Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) employees will collaborate for the national protest day to protest against the execution of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) as a private medical college, CEB Joint Trade Union Convener Ranjan Jayalal said.
Speaking at a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, he said that August 2 had been declared as the ‘National Protest Day’ to carry out protests island-wide to stand against SAITM and CEB employees will provide their fullest cooperation for it.
Jayalal also said that prevailing issues could be solved only through trade union actions and not through conducting and protests or through peaceful discussions with the authorities.
The convener also warned that the civil laws would be violated if no appropriate solution would be presented to issues of the labourers, including the issue related to SAITM.
“CEB is not an organisation which operates with a financial loss. The leaders of the country have contributed to bring CEB to the state to run at a loss. Therefore, it’s the Government’s responsibility to restructure the organisation to deliver efficient services, as well as to earn revenue for the organisation,” he added.
Jayalal further said that if no favourable response would be received from the Government in relation to the prevailing issues including the SAITM issue and the attack on petroleum trade union members, a trade union action would be organised by the CEB employees after August 4.
Lanka Viduli Podu Sewaka Sangamaya (LVPSS) President Malaka Wickremasinghe also participated.
