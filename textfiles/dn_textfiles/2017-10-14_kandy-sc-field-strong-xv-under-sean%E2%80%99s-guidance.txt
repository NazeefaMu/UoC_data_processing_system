Kandy SC to field a strong XV under Sean’s guidance

Defending league rugby champions Kandy SC’s destiny in the coming season is in the capable and competent hands of three individuals, chairman Lasantha Wijesuriya, head coach Sean Wijesinghe and team manager Kapila de Silva. Lasantha has been in this position for well over 15 years. His pleasant approach is drawing the players to Nittawela. Wijesinghe who helped the Nittawela club to reach dizzy heights in the last two years, is out to prove himself once again and team manager Kapila who has been in this seat for the tenth year approaches the players cleverly and looks after their needs and knows how to manage a team. All three are former Sri Lanka caps. These three with the advice coming from Mr. Rugby Malik Samarawickrama, are helping immensely thereby making it clear that Kandy SC will be a force to be reckoned with in the coming season. As many as 35 players have been seen at practices. This season too they are with a very good side with few new faces. There are Kingswoodians Lakshitha S Ranaweera a fly half, Heshna Janson scrum half, Hirusena Anuranga front row forward, two Trinitians Dilukshana Dange a good winger and scrum half Shamal Abeyawickrema, The other player who has come to Nittawela is last year’s Havelock SC prop Ashan Darling. The assistant coach is Saliya Kumara.
