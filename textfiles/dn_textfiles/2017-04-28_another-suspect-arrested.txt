Another suspect arrested

 The Police on Thursday night arrested another suspect in connection with the shooting at two prison buses in Kalutara in February this year. Seven persons including an underworld kingpin ‘Samayan’ and two prison guards were killed in the shooting. The 38-year-old suspect was arrested in Kinigama, Malwathuhiripitiya.
He was a resident of Buthpitiya, Malwathuhiripitiya. The same suspect had previously been in Police custody for attempting to shoot ‘Samayan’ at the Kaduwela Magistrate’s Court premises in 2015. He had been serving in the Army since 1998, but had been removed from service from 2001 following a murder in Malwathuhiripitiya.
