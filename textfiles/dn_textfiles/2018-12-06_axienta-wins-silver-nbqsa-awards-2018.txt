Axienta wins Silver at NBQSA Awards 2018

Axienta (Pvt) Ltd, the market leader in Sales Force Automation software solutions, achieved yet another milestone by being awarded the much coveted ‘Silver’ at the National Best Quality ICT Awards 2018 under the category ‘Retail and Supply Chain Management’. NBQSA Awards Night and Gala Dinner were held at Galadari Hotel Colombo celebrating its 20th Anniversary.

Axienta has been the trusted solution provider to a number of leading blue chip corporations including John Keells Holdings, Cargills, Sunshine Holdings, Maliban Biscuits, Hemas Pharmaceuticals and Atlas Axillia to name a few. Axienta is known for VANTAGE SFA Enterprise, VANTAGE MRIS for medical reps and VANTAGE Telco as their key products. The company identified a potential opportunity in the SME sector in Sri Lanka.
