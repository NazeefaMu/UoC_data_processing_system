Sri Lanka - Singapore FTA to protect job market

The country’s job market will not be opened to foreigners and no professional in the country will face any injustice due to the Sri Lanka-Singapore Free Trade Agreement, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister at a meeting with representatives of the Sri Lanka Institution of Engineers and Sri Lanka Institute of Architects at Temple Trees yesterday said no professional in the country will be deprived of job opportunities under this Agreement.
It was decided to have continuous discussions with various professionals to resolve issues and misunderstandings on the FTA with Singapore.
The Prime Minister requested that he be informed on problematic areas of the Agreement and its Appendices, so that the truth can be explained.
The representatives also agreed to actively take part in monitoring the implementation of the Agreement. It was emphasized that there is room to revise the Agreement at the end of each term. Strategic Development and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama explained that the aim of the FTA with Singapore is to attract foreign investments, to create overseas job opportunities for Sri Lankans and to facilitate joint business partnerships between Sri Lankan companies and other global companies.
Secretary to Prime Minister Saman Ekanayaka, Strategic Development and International Trade Ministry Secretary Chandani Wijewardena, Emigration and Immigration Controller General M.N. Ranasinghe and Finance and Mass Media Ministry and Attorney General’s Department officials also attended the meeting.
