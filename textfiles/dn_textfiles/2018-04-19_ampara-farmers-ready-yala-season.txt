Ampara farmers ready for Yala season

About 26,000 acres of paddy will be cultivated in the Ampara district during the Yala 2018 season.
Sowing for the Yala season should be completed before April 30, Akkaraipattu Irrigation Engineer T. Mayooran said.
He was speaking at a meeting held in this regard at the Ampara District Secretariat recently headed by Ampara District Secretary Thusitha P. Wanigasingha.
Ampara District Irrigation Director Nihal Siriwardena, Irrigation Department officials, Agricultural Department officials and farmer organisation representatives were also present at this meeting.
The paddy farmers in the district have already begun tilling the land.
Usually in the Yala season 120,000 acres are cultivated. Due to the insufficiency of rainfall, the entire extent of paddy lands in the district cannot be cultivated.
In the Akkaraipattu irrigation region, about 3,849 acres of paddy lands will be included for cultivation.
Mayooran said that water for irrigation will be given from Ilukkuchenai and Neethai minor tanks.
