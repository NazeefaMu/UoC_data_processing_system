Leo Wijesinghe

Born in Wellawatta 1933, 11 April at Kinross Avenue to be precise, he used to play cricket in the seminary gardens. His play mates were none other than Dr H.I.K Fernando, P.A.T Kelly, Bobby Ghouse and many other Peterites. He caught the cricket bug by listening to the cricket commentaries by the gravel voiced John Arlott, Alan McGilvray and Vic Richardson all these gentleman are no more with us. The voices of these greats were cascading into his living room from his little radio receiver. It was of course the famous 1948 Ashes series. The eager listener was none other than Leo Wijesinghe, he was a young kid then who later became a revered veteran of Sri Lanka cricket administration.
I managed to trace Leo down at Jambugasmulla in the vicinity of St Joseph’s Church. He resembled late great Arthur C. Clarke. Leo was a genial old gent with a photographic memory. I was dumbfounded when he started rattling away the names of cricket teams of yesteryear. He made me feel at home and without further ado invited me to his library where a mountainous collection of cricket books both old and new was there to be seen. They were neatly arranged in their rightful places.Cricketing documents dating well back were also neatly stacked in their respective shelves.His stock of these invaluable books have been regularly replenished by his kith and kin living in Australia and England.
Getting down to the nitty gritty of this article; Leo Wijesinghe was a member of the Nondescripts Cricket Club for 50 years. He was also the Manager of the NCC for 12 years. Leo recalled that in 2009 he was awarded a medal by the ICC for the services rendered to Sri Lanka Cricket together with Chandra Shaffter, Ana Punchihewa, Upali Dharmadasa and Hemaka Amarasuriya. Although Leo was in such august company, he shunned publicity.
Leo was actively involved with the Lion’s till he was 80 years. At present Leo is enjoying his retirement at Jambugasmulla together with his daughter and family and passes his time watching TV (he mentioned to me that he watched the recent IPL matches till one 1 a.m.). This goes to show that cricket is not only in his blood but in his bone marrow as well. He also reads and reminisces about the good old days with a close circle of friends.
Rewinding back to school cricket in the early fifties Leo stated that he represented only his house team and that was that. However his son Rohan has made up for that being a talented cricketer who played for Sri Lanka schools and St Joseph’s.
After an insignificant school career Leo joined Brooke Bonds in 1954. He was posted to one of their factories as a supervisor, again nothing to write home about. After grafting away for 37 years he was ultimately promoted as an executive.
Incidentally 4 years after joining Brooke Bonds, Leo was roped in to become the Secretary of Brooke Bonds due to the fact that the guy who was there had a nasty misadventure and was duly punished. Leo stated that he was utterly clueless as regards to the duties that were relevant to the post then. Late T Jayalingam who was a higher-up in the hierarchy at Brooke Bonds took Leo to meet late Mr Harold Broom who was the Chairman and that was it. According to Leo he spent 20 long years as the secretary of the sports club which covered a multitude of sports such as cricket, football, athletics, hockey, netball etc. Leo learnt the trade from grass roots which stood him in good stead for his future endeavours as an administrator.
Leo mentioned that he also served in the Mercantile Cricket Association Committee with Jayantha Mendis of Maharaja’s fame at the helm. In the good old days members were elected according to their merit, honesty and integrity unlike today where it’s a different ball game.
He made 3 overseas tours as the assistant manager to Michael Tissera with the Ceylon team. In the book “Sunny Days” by Sunil Gavaskar a mention has been made of Leo Wijesinghe, late Harold de Andrado and Eddie Melder had looked after me well during my last visit and I was looking forward to meeting them again. All three of them are not only cricket-mad but also keen students of the game and we have spent a lot of time talking cricket.”
Leo was assistant treasurer of the Cricket Board for eight years when the late Minister Gamini Dissanayake was at the helm.
Leo was a gentleman to his fingertips and his son Rohan was really a chip off the old block.
Cricket administrators akin to Leo are hard to find and his wealth of experience could be invaluable to those fortunate to seek his advice. (Leo Wijesinghe could be contacted on 0723332772). On a humorous note my boss S.T. was fond of Leo’s wife’s cutlets and thereafter he was nicknamed “Cutlet”.
Last but not the least Leo reminded me that Ranjit Fernando was also a good friend of his.
Changing the theme a little bit and hope Leo does not mind me encroaching, this does not apply to Leo Wijesinghe and Muthumudalige Pushpakumara. It could be a plight of a scribe and that is to state that however much I sweat out to compose articles and arrange times etc, by and large the interviewers do not even bother to call and say thank you. Am I digging my own grave by thinking that my articles are boring or do I put it down to plain ignorance or more importantly the lack of mastery of the Queen’s language what a pity!
