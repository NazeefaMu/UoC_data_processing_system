Sugar not so sweet

Once confined to the affluent class of the country, Diabetes has now become one of the four major non communicable diseases. Much awareness has been raised on the subject with restrictions imposed on the commercial consumption of sugar, a key catalyst behind diabetes. On the contrary to its past records, diabetes is now found to affect the low and middle-income countries in a major scale. Worse still, diabetes has become a decisive factor of human life as well. Daily News Health Watch meets Endocrinologist and Diabetologist Dr Noel Somasundaram to explore every possible remedy.
Q: What are the main health concerns of patients of Type 2 Diabetes for over 20 or more years?
A: The complications of Type 2 Diabetes are the key worry for the patients. The Type 2 Diabetes is sadly a progressive disease and a multisystem disease. The longer it exists the more the complications arise. The Type 2 Diabetes results from multiple problems; the key issues are insulin resistance within the body and insulin deficiency. These result in inflammation as well as the rise of glucose that results in direct and indirect tissue damage due to deposition of altered glucose in the cells and blood vessels around the body.
In addition, there is abnormal lipid processing within the body that leads to accelerated deposition of cholesterol in arteries leading to atherosclerosis that is more aggressive than in individuals without diabetes. This process results in a much higher risk of heart attacks, strokes and peripheral vessel disease - lack of blood supply to key organs like the legs. In addition, inflammation and glucose deposition in the minute capillaries that supply organs like nerves, brain, kidneys, and the retina of the eye may result in neuropathy, dementia, kidney failure, and blindness. In addition, ongoing long-term inflammation is a concern.
The long-term inflammation in diabetes leads to multiple problems like cancers. Certain cancers like breast, colon and prostate cancers increase among the diabetics. In fact, almost all organs could be affected. The skin can be affected resulting in easy wounding in the legs. The liver can be affected resulting in cirrhosis. The hands and feet can become stiff due to damage to internal tendons, bones and muscles. The risk of fracture is higher in long-term diabetes. Peripheral neuropathy combined with poor blood supply leads to poor wound healing that result in amputations.
For blindness in adults, kidney failure, amputations of legs, heart attack and brain attacks (strokes) Type 2 diabetes is the leading cause. For those with longstanding diabetes, these as well as other organ problems are a reality. Type 2 diabetes is never a mild disease and we need to realize this and take good care of ourselves to lead as near normal life as possible. Leading a near-normal life is possible with current management strategies we employ in diabetes. These are well researched and can be done by anyone.
In Sri Lanka, most people rely on fasting blood glucose to check whether their diabetes is under control. This is wrong! The fasting blood glucose test looks at what happened at that moment only. This is inadequate to judge diabetes control as it is only a momentary test and does not reflect what happened at other times throughout life! The best ways to get a good idea of the diabetes control is the HBA1C test that can be done every three months to check whether there is a good control for three months. HBA1C reflects the amount of glucose that is deposited in the cells as it measures this process directly by checking the percentage of haemoglobin that has been altered by glucose. HBA1C is also a good marker of future complications as it reflects the degree of tissue damage that has occurred.
A good target is 7 percent but if possible, a lower value should be aimed at- particularly the young and those newly diagnosed to have diabetes can lead a normal life by getting a value less than 6.5 percent or even lower. Additionally, self-monitoring of blood glucose using a glucometer at multiple times of the day to make sure that not just in the fasting state but throughout the day and in all circumstances the glucose remains under control will give plenty of information on how to keep the glucose despite changes in life; A value below 140mg/dl after meals being a good target for most.
It is necessary to prevent the development of complications with a statin (e.g. Atorvastatin, Rosuvastatin). Currently, the recommendations are that statin should be taken to prevent in those with diabetes who are older than 40 years of age even if the lipid profile is normal. In those under 40 years of age, the statin is started if the LDL cholesterol is more than 130mg/dl. It is important to remember that statins are taken. Statins are anti-inflammatory i.e. they reduce inflammation in the atherosclerotic plaques and reduces rupture of plaques and development of angina or heart attack. When using a statin the lipid levels are often very low and this is good. The above three are called ABC of diabetes; control of A1C, Blood Pressure and Cholesterol. This multifactorial control is the state of the art and current standard practice across the world. This triple approach leads to a reduction of most complications of diabetes and in those who have complications already results in reduction or arrest of worsening of those complications. As is well known, prevention is the best remedy. Most of the dreaded complications of diabetes can be prevented before they occur or at worst arrested in early stage even after they develop.
Q: What are the medical tests patients should do to be on the safe track?
A: It is recommended that those with diabetes check their glucose themselves multiple times a day and blood pressure be measured at least monthly. HBA1C test should be done every three months.
A lipid profile is done at the onset to decide dose of statins and thereafter occasionally to make sure that the lipids remain ‘low’. Annually the following should be done. Feet examination, eye examination, kidney tests. Heart checks have to be done when there are symptoms or suspicion of heart issues. Similarly based on complications other tests may be required.
Key strategies
1. Good glycemic control
Diabetes is higher in those who do not control the disease well. On the contrary, those who control diabetes well can expect to reduce the complications of diabetes.
2. Blood pressure control
Blood pressure rises in diabetics. High blood pressure develops before the development of diabetes mellitus. Increased blood pressure multiplies the risk of developing serious complications like heart attack, stroke, kidney failure and blindness due to retinopathy.
3. Lipid control
Even if the cholesterol and lipid profile are ‘normal’ the risk of atherosclerosis leading to heart attack and stroke are high in those with diabetes. This happens because the lipids in the blood are abnormal forms in the presence of diabetes mellitus. These are more ‘atherogenic’ and have a higher tendency to cause heart problems and others.
4. Lose weight if one is overweight or obese
Weight loss has multiple benefits. Insulin resistance and resulting inflammation improve when weight is lost and tissue injury that results from inflammation can be reduced. Weight loss also results in improvement of glucose, blood pressure and lipid levels as well as reduce the underlying problems in diabetes such as inflammation, the tendency for blood to clot easily resulting in heart attack (pro-coagulation state). Weight loss in early diabetes can even ‘cure’ diabetes. Weight loss also improves quality of life and should be attempted as early as possible.
