We will work for the betterment of all - President

President Maithripala Sirisena said as President he gave leadership to the whole country and worked for the betterment of all the people irrespective of any political, religious or communal differences.
He had told all his Ministers and Parliamentarians to fall in line and work accordingly to uplift the nation.
The President said he would therefore request the people in the North to vote for his party’s candidates contesting from the Hand symbol as they to would work for the benefit of all without any petty differences.
President Sirisena expressed these sentiments at an election rally held at Vavuniya town on February 5 in support of candidates contesting the Local Council elections in the Vavuniya, Mannar and Mullaitivu districts from the ‘Hand symbol’.
The President said he learnt that candidates contesting the elections from a certain political party had vowed to work for the benefit of only those who supported and voted for them.
“This is a wrong notion which should be detested by all. The duty of a person elected to power is to serve all without any petty differences irrespective of whether they voted for or against him or her, the President said.
President Sirisena recalled that it was he who appointed a Special Presidential Task Force to handle development work in the North and insisted that Parliamentarians and Provincial Council Ministers and members should hold its membership.
“This proved our deep personal interest in ushering development in the North,” the President said.
President Maithripala Sirisena said the government’s sole endeavour is to eliminate fraud, corruption and waste from this country. Robbery of public assets by certain politicians had caused the escalation of poverty. He would ensure that all who defrauded public assets were brought before the law and punished.
“It was during the last three yes that democracy and human rights were restored and enshrined in this country. Therefore, people who voted him to power could feel contented and rejoice,” President Sirisena said.
“Disappearances of people are never heard of today. No media institution had been set on fire either there had be no killing on abductions of media personal during the last three years under my rule,”the President added.
Wanni district Parliamentarians Leader Masthan, Telo General Secretary Parajasingham, Vavuniya SLFP organiser Chaminda Wasala, Mullaitivu SLFP organiser Eeethanjali Naguleswaran and several others also spoke.
