Former National Livestock Development Board (NLDB) Chairman M. K. Muthuvinayagam and Kadiresu Sivanesan, who were arrested for allegedly soliciting a bribe from a businessman, were yesterday further remanded by the Colombo Chief Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne.
The Bribery Commission alleged that the ex-NLDB Chairman had allegedly demanded Rs. 1.2 million from a businessman to expedite the lease of a restaurant at the Malsiripura NLDB Farm. However, it was later negotiated to Rs. 600,000.
The ex-Chairman had carried out this deal through a person known as Kadiresu Sivanesan.
Sivanesan was sent to collect the alleged bribe from the businessman and based on a complaint made by the businessman, the Bribery Commission officers had observed the incident. Sivanesan, having obtained the cash had called the ex-NLDB Chairman to confirm that he had received the money.
