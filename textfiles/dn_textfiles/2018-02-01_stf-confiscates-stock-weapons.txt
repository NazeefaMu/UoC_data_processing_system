STF confiscates stock of weapons

A Special Task Force (STF) team from Jaffna, acting on information received, had recovered a stock of weapons from a well in Arali North on Tuesday. 
The Police Media Spokesman’s Office told the Daily News that the STF personnel had received information from residents about a stock of weapons that was found in an abandoned well. Subsequently, they had obtained a warrant from the Mallakam Courts to recover the stock of weapons. 
Among the recovered stock of weapons were 1,160 live ammunition and another stock of 14,792 bullets, a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG), two 6-mm mortars, a 40-mm grenade launcher, and 15 bullets. 
It is believed that some of the weapons are newer than the rest and police claim that further investigations would be conducted to determine who had put the stock of weapons in the well. 
Meanwhile, STF personnel had taken measures to defuse the grenades.
