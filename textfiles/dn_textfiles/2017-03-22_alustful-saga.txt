Alustful saga

“With great power comes great responsibility. Yet some people in the society abuse power vested in them by the society itself to hamper the smooth sailing process of the social order. Filmmakers are gifted with the power to unfold such stories and more on big screen with a philosophical view”, says veteran filmmaker Chandran Rutnam.
According to Mathew, the newest cinematic venture of Chandran Rutnam features world renowned Sri Lankan born singer Alston Koch of ‘Gimme that Banana’ fame and Sri Lankan born actress Jacquelyn Fernandez who has made it big in Bollywood.
According to Mathew is based on a true incident happened in the late 1970s in the Sri Lankan soil that became the talk of the town.
Sinhala dubbed version of According to Mathew is branded as “Anuragini”. Both Sinhala and English versions will be released simultaneously on April 7 in the CEL circuit.
Sinhala version will be screened at Regal, Lido, Himali-Kiribathgoda, Amity Lite Maharagama, Odeon Mt Lavinia and 25 other centers, while Majestic Cineplex, Empire Arcade, Savoy 3D and City Cinema Mt Lavinia are secured for the English version’s screening.
Dubbing in Tamil is on the cards.
According to Mathew story revolves around a socially popular and powerful protestant priest in Colombo who was subject to a sex scandal involving a seductive and wealthy married woman.
In a press conference held at the Colombo Golf club to announce the release of the movie Chandran Rutnam revealed many aspects of his latest venture and more.
“This story should have been told 25 years ago. Father Mathew was our family friend. He performed exorcism too. There was so much of goodness in him. He once brought a poor child from a village in Sri Lanka all the way to America to get a heart surgery done free-of-charge by the best doctors in the world. When they arrived in Los Angeles, they stayed with me one night before flying to Houston the next day.
Back in Sri Lanka while he was imprisoned I met him near the Welikada prison in prison shorts with a book in his hand”, says Rutnam.
He continues, “Father Mathew invited me to come and see him in the prison. When I obliged he requested rather demanded me to do a film on his story the way he wanted. When I suggested we feature Gamini Fonseka in the lead role, Father Mathew said he will play it. That project didn’t materialize. After decades gone by we revived the project with my screenplay”.
“Filmmakers can perform magic. This story is already out and is in the internet. I am only giving the visual aspect of it with my viewpoint”, he claimed.
When asked whether he has imported foreign technicians for the project Rutnam said, “We have technicians, cinematographers and actors whose talents and know-how are on par with world standards. So why import people? What we need at this juncture is to have better exposure for our films in the global context. We made ‘According to Mathew’ to cater to that need. It is a Sri Lankan product going into the worldwide distribution”.
He requested resourceful young film directors to do good Sri Lankan stories and project them to the world and commended films like Premaya Nam and Aloko Udapadi as films having original stories.
Professionalism
Rutnam said Jacquelyn Fernandez is a very professional and a great actress and he groomed Alston Koch to fit into the character of Father Mathew.
“Koch did a tremendously wonderful performance. This is Jacquelyn’s first English film. This film will be a stepping stone for her into Hollywood”, predicts Rutnam.
Chandran Rutnam did ‘A Common Man’ with Sir Ben Kingsley prior to making According to Mathew.
He said pinnacle of his film career however is yet to happen. “I have a personal liking towards ‘The Road from Elephant Pass’ that I made some years back. Right now my main focus is on According to Mathew”, he commented.
“We are in the business called Show-business. Hence we cannot neglect the business aspect of our works. Awards are nice…but those are not the significant thing. To keep this business going we have to give due attention to the economic factor, and must be adhered to.
‘Commercial’ is not a dirty word. Even in a commercial film there is art. If we try to separate art from commercial, it is nonsense. My films are commercial-art ones. We have to get out of this shell where we make art house films for awards.
I like to make films that you understand and films that keep you entertained. My job is to entertain you for money”, he added.
International exposure
Rutnam commissioned Film Location Services Company in 1980 to bring famed producers and directors in Hollywood into Sri Lanka to make films.
He collaborated with world renowned filmmaker and his close friend Steven Spielberg once as the line-producer of the sequel to the Indiana Jones movie; ‘Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom’ shot in Sri Lanka. Performance of late D R Nanayakkara as a tribal chieftain in the movie was commended by Spielberg.
“Most seen Sri Lankan actor worldwide is D R Nanayakkara and that was due to his performances in this box office movie, Rutnam says.
Chandran Rutnam also did the box office movie Adara Kathawak casting Menik Kurukulasuriya some decades back.
