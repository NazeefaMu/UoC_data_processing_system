SAITM students’ parents to complain against unqualified students

State Medical Students’ Parents’ Union will make a complaint to the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) in connection with all state officials who are responsible for recruiting 54 unqualified students to SAITM, media spokesman of the union, Wasantha Alwis said.
Addressing the media in Colombo yesterday, he said that it is not good governance to file a case against state medical students and their supporters who fought to protect free education while allowing state officials who recruited unqualified students to SAITM to go free.
The police’s brutal attack launched on state medical students who protested against SAITM is unacceptable as is their warm welcome of SAITM students who went to meet politicians and officials.
The police ill treated qualified students while offering a warm welcome to unqualified students.
The union’s national organiser Ashoka Ranwala said that the union has unofficial information about the educational qualifications and other details of SAITM students. The University Grants Commission does not give details of SAITM students because they have to hide those details in order to protect the identities of unqualified students. But legal action will be taken against all state officials who failed to provide information requested by the union.
The Union’s Secretary Prem Kulathilaka said that the government cannot repair the air conditioning of the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital cardiology theatre but pays Rs.300 million monthly to the SAITM hospital.
Medical Faculty Students’ Action Committee Convener Didula Amarasinghe said that the KDU Act needs to be re-amended to absorb SAITM students who had passed three or less subjects in the GCE Advanced Level examination in two or three sittings. According to the law of Sri Lanka, only the students who pass all three subjects in one sitting are eligible to enter the university.
