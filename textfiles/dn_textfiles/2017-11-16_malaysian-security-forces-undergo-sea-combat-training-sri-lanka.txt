Malaysian security forces to undergo sea combat training in Sri Lanka

 
Malaysian security and enforcement personnel will undergo sea combat training in Sri Lanka to strengthen and upgrade their skills in maritime security control, Malaysian Newspaper New Straits Times reported today.
According to that report, Eastern Sabah Security Command (Esscom) commander Datuk Hazani Ghazali said the training would be conducted next year with Sri Lanka’s security forces.
Dubbed Sea Combat Course, the training is aimed at equipping the Esscom team with added skills.
“Sri Lanka’s expertise in safeguarding their waters is recognized worldwide,” he told reporters at the Esscom monthly gathering at the police marine base.
Hazani said about 20 personnel from three agencies – police, armed forces, and the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency - would participate in the intensive training.
