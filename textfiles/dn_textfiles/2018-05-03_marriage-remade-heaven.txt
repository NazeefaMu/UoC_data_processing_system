Marriage (re)made in heaven!

The new Cabinet of the ‘Yahapaalanaya’ government headed by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was sworn in on May Day after a great deal of political manoeuvring and introspection from within both the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and the United National Party (UNP).
The Cabinet is dominated by the UNP, given that the number of SLFP parliamentarians loyal to President Sirisena has dwindled to twenty-five with sixteen SLFP ministers and MPs leaving the government following the unsuccessful motion of no-confidence against Prime Minister Wickremesinghe.
There were significant changes in some portfolios, with some of them even changing between the SLFP and the UNP, but there were no major surprises. The only ‘newcomer’ to the Cabinet was Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe being in sworn in as Minister of Higher Education and Cultural Affairs. Rajapakshe had earlier quit as Minister of Justice after the UNP demanded his resignation. As such, there was no one receiving a Cabinet portfolio for the first time. At the time of writing, appointments to deputy minister and state minister posts were yet to be made.
Much-anticipated appointments
Two portfolios held by the SLFP previously were hand over to the UNP. The Ministry of Social Empowerment and Social Welfare was divided between P. Harrison (Social Empowerment) and Daya Gamage (Social Welfare). Gamage is also responsible for Primary Industries. Ravindra Samaraweera was appointed as the Minister of Labour and Trade Union Relations, also previously held by the SLFP.
Some of the much-anticipated appointments did not materialise. Although there was a request from the UNP to appoint Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka as Minister of Law and Order, Ranjith Madduma retained that Ministry. President Sirisena has also resisted a request by the UNP to reappoint Ravi Karunanayake to the Cabinet.
The lead up to the reshuffle was not without its share of drama, both in the SLFP and the SLFP. In the SLFP, President Sirisena was under pressure to allow the party to leave the government. In the UNP, the Premier was under scrutiny for the reforms he was undertaking within the party.
At the SLFP’s last Central Committee some SLFP parliamentarians wanted a vote on whether the party should continue in a coalition with the UNP. However, President Sirisena who was presiding decided that such a move would be counterproductive in that it could aggravate the divisions within the party.
There were also suggestions that posts held by party officials should be reviewed. Many interpreted this to be a move against the general secretaries of the SLFP and the United Peoples’ Freedom Alliance (UPFA), Duminda Dissanayake and Mahinda Amaraweera.
It will be recalled that at the last general elections in 2015, President Sirisena ran into some strife with the then general secretaries of the SLFP and UPFA, Anura Priyadarshana Yapa and Susil Premajayantha. Soon after the polls, he replaced them with Dissanayake and Amaraweera. Last week, there were calls for these appointments to be reviewed but the President did not respond favourably to the suggestion.
Instead, the President proposed a ‘reorganisation’ of the SLFP and said this will be undertaken after the new session of Parliament is inaugurated next Tuesday. Significantly, it is during this session that the sixteen SLFPers who voted for the motion of no-confidence against the Prime Minister are due to sit on the opposition benches.
Meaningful reforms
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe too had to navigate through some stormy weather in his own party, the UNP, where he had promised meaningful reforms, firstly in the aftermath of the February 10 local government elections and secondly following the motion of no-confidence against him.
Several committees had been appointed to study reforms in the party and these committees had presented their recommendations. A twelve member ‘Politburo’ was also appointed, tasked with taking overarching policy decisions as it was felt that this was beyond the unwieldy Working Committee.
Despite these efforts, there were two issues that created unease within the party. They related to the retention of Ravi Karunanayake as Assistant Leader of the party and the appointment of Akila Viraj Kariyawasam as general secretary.
Karunanayake has been under a cloud recently, even since he was implicated by association in the Central Bank bond sale controversy. His portfolio was changed from Finance to Foreign Affairs in May 2017 because of this.
Subsequent evidence led before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the bond sale revealed that Karunanayake’s rented apartment had been paid for by Arjuna Aloysius, the son-in-law of former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran and a key person of interest in the inquiry. Following this revelation, Karunanayake resigned from the Cabinet in August 2017, albeit protesting his innocence.
Minister and Former Attorney General Tilak Marapana were asked by the UNP leadership to inquire into what steps need to be taken regarding Karunanayake. Marapana recommended that Karunanayake should refrain from discharging his duties as Assistant Leader of the UNP until finality is reached in respect of the legal issues related to the findings of the Commission of Inquiry.
It is against such a backdrop that Karunanayake’s continuation as Assistant Leader was opposed. Although many opposed the appointment, two stalwarts spoke out: Former Speaker Joseph Michael Perera and Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake.
Though not currently a parliamentarian, Perera is a party elder, having entered Parliament in 1976 at the Ja-Ela by-election, even before Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and is therefore much respected. Perera stormed out of the Working Committee meeting stating he cannot agree to Karunanayake’s appointment and subsequently tendered his resignation from the Working Committee. Similarly, there was some discontent about Kariyawasam’s appointment which was due to two schools of thought about the role of the general secretary. The Ruwan Wijewardene Committee which studied party reforms had recommended that the post of general secretary should be a person who is not an active politician and hence able to devote his entire time to the party.
Indeed, this had been the practice during the J. R. Jayewardene era of the UNP and the name of Imtiaz Bakeer Markar had been proposed for the post. Markar, a former parliamentarian and fluent in all three languages, was a popular choice among the parliamentary group.
Comments on party leadership
However, there was a different view that the general secretary should be an appointment made by the party leader to avoid potential conflict. The SLFP’s experience in 2015 was cited as a case in point. Eventually, Kariyawasam’s appointment was accepted but it wasn’t a unanimous choice.
Some, such as Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera, in fact, spoke out against the party leadership publicly. Perera was critical of the reforms and stated that they do not meet the aspirations of the majority of party members. Other UNPers have however opted to discuss their grievances in private.
While there is an appreciation that party reforms would never please all factions in the UNP, it is left to be seen whether the UNP will now stand united with a view to taking on its electoral challenges- or whether the reforms will lead to further discontent and unrest.
The next step for the new Cabinet sworn in on Tuesday is to consolidate its agenda. It is no secret that the UNP and SLFP have been at cross purposes for the past three years even though they were part and parcel of the same government. The President and the Prime Minister are keen that this rivalry is replaced by a common agenda.
Minister Sarath Amunugama has been entrusted with the task of formulating such an agenda. What will follow in the next two years is virtually the “second innings” of the “Yahapaalanaya” government. The UNP and the SLFP hope it will be better than the first- and no doubt the country will watch them with interest.
