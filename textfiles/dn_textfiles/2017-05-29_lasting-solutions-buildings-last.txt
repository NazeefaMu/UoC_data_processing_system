Lasting solutions for buildings to last

Everyone dreams of a house of their own. However, S. Radha who has lived and owned a luxurious apartment for the last 10 years in Wellawatte is yet to receive the title deeds for his apartment. Radha is not alone in not having a legal right to his dwelling and is one of many in and around Colombo struggling to get housing deeds from their builders.
Unauthorized structures and illegal building practices have been a bane in Colombo for some time now. When the unauthorized sections of the Excellency Building in Wellawatte collapsed recently, it highlighted one of the many issues in our poorly regulated construction sector.
K. Wijeyaratne, a resident of Bambalapitiya claimed that the entire responsibility of the collapse in Wellawatte as well as the environmental and physical harm caused by unauthorized constructions in and around Colombo lay in the hands of the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) and the Urban Development Authority (UDA) since it was their duty to inspect the quality and the condition of the buildings.
Measures taken by UDA
Jagath Munasinghe
The authority of taking legal action against the owners of unauthorized buildings is currently vested upon the Urban Development Authority (UDA). They have the power to inspect the suitability and feasibility of the constructions. Yet, neither the CMC nor any government institution has responded with any report on the quality and the standards of buildings so far.
UDA Chairman Jagath Munasinghe said, in mid-2016, a survey was done in Southern Colombo (Bambalapitiya, Wellawatte, Kirulapone and Pamankada) and identified many unauthorized constructions.
“We have identified around 2,000 buildings that have violated regulations. There were a huge number of buildings that have never come to the relevant authorities for any approval,” he said.
CMC Commissioner V. K. Anurain meanwhile said that he had not given the opportunity anyone to build any unauthorized constructions since he took office in 2015.
Anura explained that it was difficult for the CMC to get involved in each and every unauthorized construction taking place given the limited number of staff they had. Therefore, he requested the public and the citizens to inform and reveal any kind of unauthorized constructions taking place so that they could proceed with legal action against the accused.
Based on an outcome of the survey conducted by them, the UDA has identified thousands of unauthorized constructions within the city of Colombo. The issuing of license for constructions is carried out by the UDA whereas the provincial institutions obtain authority from the UDA to proceed with the arrangements.
Munasinghe said unauthorized constructions do not require the time consuming and complicated procedure of obtaining numerous approvals, licenses and certificates as well as paying taxes for utilities and complying with administrative rules with regard to the basic characteristics of the building itself.
“Unauthorized constructions vary in nature. Some have illegal ownership to land and constructed not according to the building regulations. Some have illegal ownership to land but constructed as per regulations and some have legal ownership but constructed not according to the building regulations,” he said.
Being a gazetted area, Colombo is subject to the regulations of the Urban Development Authority Law and all constructions should comply with the legal provisions; if not, they are identified as unauthorized housing constructions.
Munasinghe said, in 2016 December, they took 200 buildings as a sample to analyze the kind of violations that had taken place.
“Only 10 percent of them can be regularized or given approval with minor changes. Others needed to be demolished or subjected to major reconstructions. The owners of these constructions forwarded applications seeking for approval,” he said.
According to the UDA’s rough estimation, there are around 10,000 unauthorized constructions. Those buildings were constructed without any required approvals and they do not have proper documents either.
Munasighe explained that development includes subdivision of a land even if it needs to be divided into smaller plots. Developmental purposes could be residential, extending the ground or the upper floor, reconstruction and changing the purpose of initial construction. For all these activities, the builders should obtain the approval or permit to commence constructions.
“Since 2017, the UDA has withdrawn some powers vested on Municipal Councils, Urban Councils and Pradeshiya Sabhas related to the approval for developments. Earlier, around 1985, the planning and enforcement powers were vested with the local authorities. But again in 2017, the UDA withdrew some of these powers from the local authorities.
The powers include the approval to subdivide a land over 40 perches, any building that has over 4,000 sq ft, a building over four floors, a construction that has an effect on the environment such as a petrol shed or factories, any building that is constructed in sacred areas and UNSCO heritage sites,” he said.
He said the application was available in the UDA website and the builders had the option to hand it over it to the head office or one of the regional offices. For small development purposes, builders can get the approval from the local authorities.
“Once the builders submit the planning approval, one of our officers will inspect the site and then it is forwarded to the planning committee. Afterwards, if everything is in line, they will be given a building permit. The permit is valid for a period of one year and it can be renewed three times. If the builder exceeds the time period, he has to get a special permission or a new permit. Once the construction is completed the builder has to request the local authority for the Certificate of Conformity (Compliance Certificate), to approve that the builder has constructed in line with the plan initially submitted,” he said.
Struggle to obtain ownerships of apartments
Munasinghe said if the initial plan had changed, the relevant authority would not issue a compliance certificate and added that the people who are purchasing the apartments also have an important role to play.
“Any person who is planning to purchase an apartment (pre-sale), they should check whether the builder has the planning and continuously monitor whether the builder is constructing according to the plan. If a person is aspiring to buy an apartment that is already built, check whether they have the Compliance Certificate,” he said.
Radha said it has been 10 years since she bought an apartment in Wellawatte but has not received her deeds yet.
“I spoke to the builder several times but he never gave me a proper answer. He promised us that we will be getting the deeds this year,” she said.
She added that the builder has made changes to the initial plan that was proposed.
M. Wickremasinghe, another resident of Wellawatte has been occupying his apartment for the last six years without a deed. Wellawatte has the highest construction of apartment buildings in the country.
“We paid the full amount to the builder when I bought this apartment. It all happened in a hurry, so I blindly trusted the builder. I don’t know what will happen to us,” saidWickremasinghe.
The residential owners also claimed that there was an increase in the number of construction companies as well.
Munasinghe stressed on the need to have a proper monitoring system.
“When we receive applications for approval, we have decided to monitor the constructions every six months to check whether the constructions are taking place according to the approved plan. It will prevent the large scale demolition of buildings,” he said.
He said the UDA started this from February this year and it will continue to carry out surveys on a priority basis to target critical locations such as canal reservations and main roads.
“The bigger survey will be carried out by the Census and Statistics Department. That is a long term plan and that will include all the details of the family as well, not only the constructions. But our focus will be on unauthorized constructions. It will be a database,” he said.
Munasinghe explained that once the builder requests for compliance certificate, the UDA requests them to submit a document from the architect and structural engineer giving an assurance that the building was constructed according to the plan and the structural stability. According to that, the relevant authority will issue the compliance certificate.
“The UDA informed the owners to submit whatever the approval certificates that they have. Once we get them, we would check to identify what kind of regulations that they have violated. If they don’t submit any documents, we monitor the construction and if it was an unauthorized construction, we inform them to demolish the building in seven days. If they don’t, we will file a case in courts,” he said.
Residential apartments and high rise commercial buildings are on the rise everyday in Colombo. However, the relevant authorities are yet to find a solution to ensure that all buildings stick to building regulations. While development is encouraged by the government on the one hand, measures to ensure feasibility and the stability of constructions still remain a question.
