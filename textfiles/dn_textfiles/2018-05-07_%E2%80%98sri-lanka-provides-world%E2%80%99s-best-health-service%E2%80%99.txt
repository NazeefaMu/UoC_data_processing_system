‘Sri Lanka provides world’s best health service’

The World Health Organization (WHO) earlier mentioned Cuba having the world's best health service, but it says now Sri Lanka having the world's best, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
The Health Minister was addressing the gathering at a ceremony in Polonnaruwa recently.
The Sri Lankan health sector showed a significant advancement after 2015 and enjoyed international recognition. The former Health Minister, President Maithripala Sirisena contributed immensely to reach the coveted place, the Minister said.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that today Sri Lanka offers free health services for the poor unlike in the past when the Rajapaksas were at the helm.
A WHO report in 2017 shows that the political leadership of Sri Lanka has directly contributed towards the advancement of its health service. The WHO, UNICEF and WB has confirmed that Sri Lanka's health service, especially the primary healthcare, is at the top, he said.
