Interim Order issued preventing police from acting against Gota

 
The Court of Appeal today issued an Interim Order preventing police from acting against former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa under Public Property Act against, on a Magistrate’s court inquiry over a complaint that the D.A. Rajapaksa Museum and Memorial in Medamulana was built using public funds amounting to Rs.90 million.
The Interim Order was issued on the basis of an ex parte proceeding by two-judge-bench comprising Court of Appeal (President) Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya and Justice Shiran Gunaratne pursuant to a writ petition filed by Gotabaya Rajapaksa.
The Court upheld the petitioner’s version that the certificate issued under section 8(1) of the offences against the Public Property Act is ultra vires or violative of petitioner’s legitimate expectations.
