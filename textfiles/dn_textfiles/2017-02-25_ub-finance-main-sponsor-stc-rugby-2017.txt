UB Finance has come forward as the main sponsor for S. Thomas’ College Rugby and an agreement was exchanged between Ransith Karunaratne, Director/CEO of UB Finance, Suresh Kandiah, Chief Operating Officer at UB Finance and Rev. Marc Billimoria, Warden of S. Thomas’ College at a ceremony held recently.
Under the sponsorship agreement UB Finance will pledge their support towards STC’s first XV squad and the Under 18 team during the 2017 inter school rugby season.
“This is a great opportunity for us at UB Finance. We are honoured that we are able to support the STC Rugby team and hope that this partnership adds further value to their performance”, commented Suresh Kandiah, Chief Operating Officer at UB Finance.

Rugby has always been an important part of tradition at S. Thomas’. The Thomian side is equipped with many talented and illustrious players and in 2016 the team concluded the league as runners up after a thrilling and exciting season.
The team hopes to claim the top position at the 2017 season.
