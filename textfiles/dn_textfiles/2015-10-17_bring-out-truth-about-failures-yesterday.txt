Govt's major task at hand
Bring out the truth about failures of yesterday

The unearthing of the ugly aspects of the country's recent history has gathered some speed in recent weeks, in considering the number of new probes that have been launched, the keener conduct of probes already underway, and the increasing calls for action to ensure the good functioning of the Police and Attorney General's Departments.
The action against crime and corruption under the previous regime certainly requires the unquestioned attention of the Government, in keeping with the pledges given to the people prior to the Silent Revolution of January 8; and to ensure that society is protected from such activities in the future. Such protection is a necessity to carry out the social, political and economic changes needed to put in place a system of good governance, with full accountability to the people.
The quadruple arrests made by the Police in the Seya Sadewmi, rape and murder, is a glaring example of the problems faced by the Police, in the absence of good community - police relations, which was frowned upon by the previous government. It is also a sign of the political influence that continues to prevail in dealing with law and order, especially in the context of the present government of consensus, which is an alliance of political groups that have hugely different policies, one of which having many members associated in the public mind with the fraud, corruption and influence peddling by the Rajapaksa regime.
Twists and turnarounds
The detention for questioning of Pillayan, the former LTTE cadre and later Chief Minister of the Eastern Province, vis-à-vis the assassination of TNA Member of Parliament Joseph Pararajasingham, the arrest of the political tear jerker and former Minister Janaka Bandara Tennekoon, on an allegation of murder, and probes by the FCID on former Service Chiefs and others on their political activity while engaged in diplomacy, are good indications of progress, which require continued vigilance by civil society to prevent political manipulation in the new political situation of consensus amidst confusion.
The delays, twists and turnarounds in the law enforcement process are seen today in the changes taking place in the allegations made against the Avant Guarde organization, the issues involving Rakna Lanka, and the summoning of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and other prominent members of the UPFA before the Presidential Commission to inquire into allegations of fraud and corruption. It is also a matter of related interest as to why there is so much delay in the Police taking to a conclusion the charges against the wife of the NFF leader, Wimal Weerawansa, on allegedly holding false NICs and passports, irrespective of the final court decision of innocence or guilt, because this is certainly not a case that requires matters such as DNA testing, which saw the huge confusion in the Seya Sadewmi case.
While all of this is drawing much public attention, the Government will soon have to come to terms on how it is to deal with the allegations that are being made against it on being a co-sponsor of the latest UNHRC resolution, which passed without a division in Geneva. The Abhayaramaya forces, that organized the two unsuccessful campaigns for Mahinda Rajapaksa for the January 8 presidential polls and the August 17 General Election, have now decided to carry out a major attack on the government's policy on the inquiry mechanism on alleged war crimes and violations of humanitarian law, as well as action to promote peace and reconciliation.
The bogey talk
The focus of the new attack is on what they call threats to the country's sovereignty and independence, and accusing the government of becoming a lackey to US Foreign Policy. The issue of sovereignty is certainly one that can gather considerable public interest, and even support, unless proper action is taken to carry out a good campaign to educate the public on the realities of the post-Geneva situation.
The arrival of billas or bogeys bringing threats to national sovereignty and the rights of the people, underlined with claims of threats to members of the armed forces - the national heroes who defeated the LTTE being hauled before foreign judges or courts, and what is seen as dangers of being hooked to US foreign policy, will certainly require good and firm responses from the Government.
Among the charges being made is that the Government should not talk about having saved Mahinda Rajapaksa from the electric chair, because of the new Geneva understanding. It is necessary to remind those who make this call that it was Mahinda Rajapaksa himself, and his strongest supporters, (some of who are now in government) who repeatedly and loudly made the claim that MR is ready to go to the electric chair to save our heroic forces, when they all knew that the electric chair was never part of any threat faced by Sri Lanka. This is an ugly regurgitation of one's own fanciful and fraudulent propaganda, which is being used against the Government, which in fact saved the country from a possible regime of western sanctions.
The China line
We also now read about the United States having repeatedly tabled its resolution against Sri Lanka at the UNHCR, because of Sri Lanka's close links with China. It is necessary to remind those who make such claims that the US - from the time of Richard Nixon till Obama today, has been building the strongest relations with China, which was seen in the recent meeting between Presidents Barack Obama and Xi Jinping in Washington, too. The United States had shown in no uncertain way that its relations with China do not depend on the latter's record on human rights and other related issues. It is a relationship between the world's largest economy and one that is fast catching up with it.
There are certainly issues over the Chinese interest in President Xi's New Silk Road, which was supported without question by Mahinda Rajapaksa. This issue is not confined to the United States, but to our closest neighbour, India, too, that is also concerned about the interests that China has in establishing controls in the Indian Ocean. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is promoting Project Mausam, which is considered his government's most significant foreign policy initiative designed to counter China, and is inspired by India's historical role as a focal point for trade in the Indian Ocean. Sri Lanka's own strategic location in the Indian Ocean routes is a matter of great importance. Yet this should not be dragged in, to mislead the people on the real purpose and impact of the Geneva UNHRC resolution.
CP on LLRC
The Communist Party of Sri Lanka in its latest statement on the UNHRC resolution is also concerned about threats to the country's sovereignty, which is not properly explained, except about our not subscribing to foreign elements. Yet, it is noteworthy that the CPSL admits the commissions and omissions made by the previous government that did contribute to the current situation. It highlights the failure to implement the recommendations of the LLRC Report, and thereby creating conditions for "external forces to interfere in the internal affairs of Sri Lanka". It adds that this failure paved the way for extremism both in the North and South of Sri Lanka to re-emerge hindering national reconciliation. It is necessary to be reminded that he CPSL was very much a "card holding" or Senior Cabinet Office holding member of the UPFA Government led by Mahinda Rajapaksa that did not implement the recommendation of its own LLRC. To the knowledge of the public it did nothing to make known its position against that policy of the Rajapaksa regime.
When talking of foreign interference by the West in our affairs today, it is also useful to recall that the United States and all members of the European Union did ban the LTTE as a terrorist organization, and this ban is still in place (although in varying aspects of implementation). Was it not an interference in Sri Lanka's national affairs, and even sovereignty, to carry out such an act involving Sri Lanka's own internal fight against the LTTE? National Sovereignty is a subject that has many aspects and facets of importance, and should not be dragged into political debates that seek limited and immediate political advantage and not a wider and lasting national interest.
Despite the issues of maintaining a consensus coalition, which often demonstrates a lack of agreement, it is necessary for the Government to take its own message forward through the media, and all means of reaching the public, to persuade the people of the truth about the 2015 Geneva Resolution, before it starts giving flesh to its recommendations on a Truth and Reconciliation Commission and other mechanisms for accountability, reconciliation and very importantly, economic progress. The truth must also be dug out to wipe out the errors of the past.
