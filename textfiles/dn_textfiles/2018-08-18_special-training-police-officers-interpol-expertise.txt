Special training for Police officers with INTERPOL expertise

PEaCE conducted a three-day training programme for officers of the Bureau for the Prevention of Abuse of Children and Women from August 5 to 7 in Negombo.
The participating officers were selected from 42 police divisions, and were trained by experts from the Child Sexual Exploitation division of INTERPOL on Sexual Exploitation of Children Online.
As Sri Lanka’s arm of ECPAT, an international network committed to End Sexual Exploitation of Children, Protecting Environment and Children Everywhere (PEaCE) is an NGO that works to protect children from all forms of abuse and promote their rights. The training was carried out as a part of PEaCE’s latest project to End Sexual Exploitation of Children Online funded by the UK Government.
The training was conducted by experts from INTERPOL, Cecilia Wallin and Marjolijn Vander Hart, who arrived in Sri Lanka on the invitation of Mohammed Mahuruf, the Executive Director of PEaCE, to conduct the training for police officers.
The programme was inaugurated on August 5 by Inspector General of Police (IGP), Pujith Jayasundara and Acting Ambassador of the Netherlands to Sri Lanka Eva van Woersem.
At the inauguration, the Inspector General of Police stated that this is a valuable opportunity for the Sri Lanka Police as the Sexual Exploitation of Children Online has become a grave crime all over the world, and it is important to obtain international support to prevent such crimes. The training focused on the methods of identification of victims and investigation techniques that could be used for crimes conducted on the internet using various web sites, applications and servers. The knowledge was provided to officers regarding the techniques and investigation methods used by many international police forces during investigation of crimes. Further, the officers were taught on how to gather information through a computer or a mobile phone when a crime had taken place via the internet.
The trainers explained that perpetrators have a tendency to publish incriminating evidence on the internet in the form of photographs, videos and forum chats about their sexual abuse and exploitation of children. They also share them, and often earn money by selling them to third parties.
Sometimes children are blackmailed through social media and threatened by the perpetrators to produce or to obtain sexual images and videos of children. Once any child sexual abuse material (CSAM), such as a photo or video, is released to the internet regardless of the application, it’s impossible to delete as it is saved in various servers around the world.
As the internet connects people globally speedily, this means thousands access and download the material within minutes of release. Therefore, the sharing of such material will cause trauma and ruin the child’s life.
To investigate such crimes and to collect evidence, law enforcement officers will have to use specific techniques, tools and employ expert knowledge.
As such, this training served as the base to provide this knowledge, while serving to increase the sensitivity of officers towards survivors by showing them the suffering that the victims go through.
The programme also received the support of the Director of the Bureau for the Prevention of Abuse of Children and Women in the Police, Superintendent of Police Lanka Amarasekera and Deputy Director Bimshani Jasinghaarachchi, who were present during the programme.
It was notable that this was the first time that an NGO in Sri Lanka had organized such an international level training for the police, and the first time that the INTERPOL had visited Sri Lanka to provide such training. The participants also expressed delight in being able to attend the training as it was provided for the Bureau’s police officers who directly interact with the survivors.
The training ended on August 7 after providing the police officers an opportunity to broaden their knowledge regarding the investigation techniques and victim identification on Online Child Sexual Exploitation crimes. All 52 attendees were also given certificates.
