Eight IUSF protesters granted bail

 
Eight student activists including a Buddhist monk attached to the Inter University Student’s Federation (IUSF) arrested for allegedly violating a Court order were ordered to be released on bail by Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe today..
Each suspect was ordered to be released on a surety bail of Rs.100,000 each and were further ordered to cooperate with the on-going investigations.
Meanwhile, the Chief Magistrate issued an order directing five television channels to provide video footage pertaining to the protest march to Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) in order to carry out further investigations.  
Further magisterial inquiry was fixed for July 21.
The eight suspects were arrested by police for allegedly violating and defying a Court order while engaged in a protest held in Colombo last Wednesday (17) demanding to abolish the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM).
The Cinnamon Gardens police complained that the protestors disregarded the Court Order and attempted to proceed towards Ministry of Higher Education and Ministry of Health despite the Court order being read out to them, urging not to proceed with the procession causing disturbance to public peace and obstructing the regular traffic flow. Police said the protestors refused to accept the Court order.
Defence counsel appearing for the suspects moved Court that his clients be released on bail whatever bail condition the court deems fit. He further denied the allegation that his clients violated the Court order and further informed told they would prove their innocence during the trial.
On May 17, the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court had issued an order preventing the protesters from being a nuisance to the public during a street protest that was to be held in the Colombo city against the SAITM.
