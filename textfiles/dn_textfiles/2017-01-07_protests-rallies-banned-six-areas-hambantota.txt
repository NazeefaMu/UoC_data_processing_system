Protests, rallies banned in six areas in Hambantota

Hambantota Magistrate Manjula Karunaratne yesterday issued an order banning protests and rallies in six areas adjacent to the Hambantota Administrative Complex and the proposed Industrial Zone. The magistrate issued the order following submissions by senior police officers.
The police informed court that a protest to be held today with the help of Buddhist monks will disturb the peace and tranquility in the area. The magistrate issued the order on nine Buddhist monks including Tissamaharama Rajamaha Viharaya chief incumbent Ven. Devalegama Dhammasena Thera and 26 persons including former Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa and Hambantota district parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa.
This order is in force for 14 days.
