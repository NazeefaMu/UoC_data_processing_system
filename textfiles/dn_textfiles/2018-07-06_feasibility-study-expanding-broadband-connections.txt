Feasibility study on expanding broadband connections

An expert committee is to be appointed to study the feasibility of expanding high standard broadband connections around the country.
The expert committee will look at ways in which licensed broadband service suppliers and licensed electricity distributors can share infrastructure facilities.
The proposal received Cabinet approval this week through a joint Cabinet paper submitted by Power and Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya and Digital Infrastructure and Foreign Employment Minister Harin Fernando.
