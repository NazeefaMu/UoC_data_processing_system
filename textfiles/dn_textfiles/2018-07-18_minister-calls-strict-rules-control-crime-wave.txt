Minister calls for strict rules to control crime wave

Strict rules need to be in place to control the crime wave in the country, Leader of the House and Public Enterprises and Kandy City Development Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
He said the government has taken action to curb underworld operations.
The minister was speaking at the launch of Lakdiriya, an enterprise loan scheme in Kandy, encouraging small and medium-scale entrepreneurs.
Under the first stage of the programme, an initiative of the minister, 300 people were granted loans. The only government that rules the country according to Buddhist principles is this Good Governance Government, he said.
The minister said today there was discipline in the country.
“The government is taking steps to eradicate underworld operations in the country unlike before when the previous government supported underworld operations. This is why many crimes were committed in the past. The underworld committed crimes and the government safeguarded the underworld. The murders of Pradeep Ekneligoda and Wasim Thajudin are the best examples,” he said.
“Our government does not support the underworld because of good governance practices. Today our country is accepted internationally.”
Referring to the loan scheme, the minister said the public does not have a clear understanding of available loan schemes in the country.
“Currently, our country has about 100 bank loan schemes. Therefore, we are taking steps to take these banking services to the rural areas. We have understood that people in the villages are ruled by scammers who loan money on high interest rates. Some people get a five percent interest rate per month. Some get loans from banks at low interest rates and give to the poor at a high interest rate. Innocent people fall prey to these scammers because of the lack of knowledge on loan schemes available from proper organisations,” he added. The minister added that there is a huge debate in the country about the government’s decision to enforce the death penalty on criminals.
“Kandy was the last kingdom to be ruled by kings. Even during that era, executions were carried out to keep the nation at peace and in order. As a good governance government, when seeing the crime wave sweeping the country, we have understood the importance of implementing strict rules and regulations. We see children getting addicted to drugs and alcohol. It is the duty of parents to keep a watchful eye over children. Prevention should start from home,” he added.
