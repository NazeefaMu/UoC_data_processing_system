Two senior officials in bribery net

President’s Chief of Staff, I.H.K. Mahanama and State Timber Corporation (STC) Chairman P. Dissanayake were arrested by Bribery Commission officers yesterday evening while accepting a bribe of Rs..20 million from an Indian businessman.
This is with regard to a deal in the shares of the Kantale sugar factory. A Bribery Commission official said the suspects had solicited a bribe of Rs. 560 million from the businessman but had later agreed to reduce it to Rs.100 million.
The duo had been arrested in the car park of a five star hotel in Colombo while accepting Rs.20 million as an advance payment.
A top official of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) said the present government under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe always gives direction and guidance to nab those involved in bribery and corruption irrespective of status and the above high profile arrests too were possible due to this fact.

It is said that after demanding Rs.560 million the suspects had brought the bribe down to Rs.100 million following negotiations with the businessman.The Indian businessman is said to have alerted the bribery officials later about the demand for the bribe from the two top local officials.The suspects are to be produced in courts.
Meanwhile CIABOC Commissioner C. Neville Guruge saidsuch high profile arrests were possible due to the present government allowing the commission to function independently without any interference.
