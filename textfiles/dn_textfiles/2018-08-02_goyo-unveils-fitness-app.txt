Concerned by this growing disillusionment and apathy and to assist individuals allot the time needed for a daily exercise regime several International bodies such as the American Heart Association, the British Health Foundation, have recommend starting in small increments. This new GOYO release has in-built capabilities to influence individuals to begin working out by allocating just 22 minutes a day with an easily achievable weekly target of the recommended 150 minutes.

As a pathway to building fitness goals, users can now easily begin with an easy 10-minutes workout propelling a short routine with long-range benefits. This can be later increased in momentum and time with the goal of increasing the total amount of physical activity per week up to 150 minutes.
Helping individuals remain motivated and stay committed to live an active lifestyle on a regular basis, GOYA has initiated a unique local community namely ‘Fitness Sri Lanka’.
