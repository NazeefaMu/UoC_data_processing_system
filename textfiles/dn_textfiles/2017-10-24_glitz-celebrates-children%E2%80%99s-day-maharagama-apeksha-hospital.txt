GLITZ celebrates Children’s Day at Maharagama Apeksha Hospital

The renowned fashion retail chain, GLITZ celebrated this year’s World Children’s Day with a special agenda of events at the Maharagama Apeksha Hospital, making it an event to remember for the children at the Apeksha hospital.
The fashion store regularly conducts CSR events to contribute to the well-being of the community.
The evening at Apeksha Hospital commenced with a magic show which gave the children in the audience an opportunity to take part and was followed by a game of musical chairs and Magic balloons being distributed. The variety of activities included an art competition which brought out the creativity within the kids.
In addition to the special celebration conducted at Apeksha Hospital, GLITZ held an innovative Children’s Day Art Competition at all its five outlets on September 30 and October 1, for youngsters under 15 years.
Over 750 children participated and will receive certificates of participation while the winners received gifts. There were three age categories – 3 to 5 years, 6 to 9 years and 10 to 15 years. The youngest category drew the ocean while the other children drew their concept of saving Planet Earth which undoubtedly helped them to become conscious of the need to preserve the environment. Children’s Day fun-filled activities at the stores included face painting along with the Art competition.
GLITZ embarked on its brand journey in 2005 and has now branched out to 5 locations including Colombo, Kandy and Negombo bringing global fashion trends within easy reach of fashion conscious customers.
GLITZ focuses on CSR activities to help children in the most vulnerable segments in our society and supports 18 children at two homes of SOS villages in Piliyandala as a part of their CSR initiative that benefit children.
