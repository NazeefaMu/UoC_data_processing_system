World Environment Day
‘Protect the environment throughout the year’

Public officials should strive hard to protect and safeguard the environment throughout the year, without restricting their endeavour to World Environment Day only, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
He was addressing the gathering as the chief guest at a ceremony held at Kegalle Independence Avenue yesterday to mark World Environment Day, which falls today. The President said the theme of World Environment Day this year was ‘Beat Plastic Pollution.’
The UN would commemorate World Environment Day today with this theme, with the participation of nearly 200 member nations.
“The importance of environmental protection should be imbued in the minds of all citizens from their childhood. We should understand that the environment is a subject entwined with morality, rather than a subject of science,” the President said.
Yesterday’s ceremony in Kegalle included the handing over of garbage recycling equipment to provincial council and local government institutions and the distribution of prizes and awards to the winners of competitions held to mark World Environment Day.
