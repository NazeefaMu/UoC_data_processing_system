Why fear that H w o r d!

The Cabinet rejected the abrogation of Articles 365 and 365A of the Penal Code enacted in 1886. And the media has informed us that same sex relationships will remain a crime. Interestingly 365 and 365A does not specifically mention “homosexuality” or “same-sex” anywhere but only states (in 365): “Whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman, or animal”, and (in 365A): “any act of gross indecency with another person”. These are the only two phrases in these Articles that seem to have been interpreted as being sufficient to criminalize homosexuality. But, can these two phrases also refer to such acts by a heterosexual person? And, has the law also set boundaries on consensual sexual intimacy?
March in favour of LGBT rights
It is not clear who brought this before the Cabinet but it is clear that it was done without any attempt to disseminate all the rational information and research available refuting the argument that any sexual orientation other than heterosexuality is abnormal and must therefore be condemned and banned.
Rejection and discrimination
Homosexuality could be due to a combination of biological, psychological and environmental factors (nature and nurture). While new evidence (Skorska et al, 2016) explores the possibility that a maternal immune response might play a key role in the developmental of a homosexual orientation in males.
LGBT people in Sri Lanka
A significant percentage of homosexuals may have suffered traumatic childhood sexual abuse and/or a detached, distant, rejecting or absent father. They also often have very strong maternal bonds and are very sensitive, creative and caring human beings. Many are confused why they are not attracted to the opposite sex and often slip into depression and have suicidal feelings because of the rejection and discrimination they face. Some parents who detect same-sex-attraction in their children are convinced that marrying them off quickly is the best solution.
Homophobia must be replaced with actively listening to the life stories of LGBT people in a nonjudgmental manner. As a community there is so much we can learn and understand from them which will hopefully steer us to accept them unconditionally and importantly even help us to fully understand our own sexual orientation.
There are influential people in Sri Lanka who prefer to remain covertly gay because they are (understandably) unable to break free from the shackles of stigma, shame and ridicule. But they must know that, all will stand up and take notice if they decide to break free and speak out fearlessly about their orientation. They can create a significant and healthy change in the perception and acceptance of LGBT people in Sri Lanka.
