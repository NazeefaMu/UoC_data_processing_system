Tipper lorry crashes on Clock Tower in Kantale

A tipper lorry laden with a stock of sand crashed on to the Clock Tower at Agbopura junction, Kantale recently.
The reason for the accident is believed to have been due to the driver falling asleep while driving. The tipper was also badly damaged and its driver who received injuries was warded at the Kantale Teaching Hospital. Kantale Police Officers of the Kantale Pradesheeya Sabha inspected the damages as the heavily damaged Clock Tower slanting due to the impact has posed a danger to passers-by.
Agbopura Police is investigating.
