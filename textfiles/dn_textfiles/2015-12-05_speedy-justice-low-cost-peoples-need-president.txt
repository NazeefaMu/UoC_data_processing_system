Speedy justice at low cost, people's need - President

 
Attention should be paid to ensure speedy justice to the people who seek the assistance of the Judiciary, said President Maithripala Sirisena on Thursday. "We have to consider the cost incurred to those who seek legal redress," he said. The President made these remarks at the launching ceremony of the book "Yali Mevena Aparadayak (A Crime Re-created)" written by Additional Solicitor General Sarath Jayamanne PC. The ceremony was held at the Main Hall of the BMICH on Thursday.
"Although the words such as democracy, freedom, similar opportunities, human rights and fundamental rights are popular, we should think about how far the people can achieve those practically, due to the cost the people have to pay for them," the President said.
President Sirisena said, "we have to think again whether the people, including politicians, government officers, those who are engaged in legal profession and religious leaders are fulfilling their responsibilities.
"If people fulfill their responsibilities, we will no more have issues in the society."
The first copy of the book written on various fields to pay attention when a criminal case is taken for hearing in the court, was presented to the President by Jayamanne.
Justice and Buddha Sasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe also participated.
