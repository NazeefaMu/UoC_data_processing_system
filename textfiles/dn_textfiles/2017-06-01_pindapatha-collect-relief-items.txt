A group of 60 members of the Maha Sangha will participate in a pindapatha in Kegalle today to collect goods and other contributions from the public to help the people distressed by the recent adverse weather conditions.
The programme organised by Kegalle Shasanarakshaka Bala Mandalaya will start at 9 am from the Wewaladeniya Mahindodaya Pirivena. Organisers said they expect contributions of linen, medicine, dried milk food, infant milk food, biscuits, mosquito nets, mosquito coils, pillows, mats, coconut milk powder, sanitary items and school equipment from donors.
At the conclusion of the pindapatha, the Maha Sangha will attend a Sanghika Dana held at the residence of the Kegalle GA.
Meanwhile, Kegalle GA Chandrasiri Bandara said items collected will be distributed among the people under a systematic programme supervised by the Kachcheri officials.
