SLIM - ESF features business tycoon S. R. Gnanam

The latest SLIM Experience Sharing Forum (ESF) was held recently at the Kingsbury Hotel featuring Managing Director of St. Anthony's Group, S. R.Gnanam as guest speaker.
Focusing on the topic ‘Family Business vs. Corporate Entities’, he emphasised that his late father built the empire that he is managing at present through the practice of maintaining business discipline.
ESF is organised by the Membership Division of SLIM and held once in two months featuring a high profiled speaker to elaborate on his or her success story and share their knowledge and experience with the participants that represent SLIM professional members, corporate sector and entrepreneurs.
Addressing over 100 participants, Gnanam shed light on opportunities and challenges faced by his father while venturing into this business and how he had made use of opportunities and dealt with challenges with the right spirit. He said the current success of his family and the diversified businesses under the company's umbrella was due to the adherence to a strictly disciplined lifestyle and business ethics.
“My late father who was the founder of this diversified business led a disciplined and simple lifestyle. He was a religious minded individual who believed in hard work and ethics. We as his descendants, and the current generation abide by these ‘rules’ set by him. We now see our businesses thrive. By adhering to these simple rules you too will see your businesses going from strength to strength. Discipline, ethics and empathy play a huge role when it comes to making businesses flourish”, stated Gnanam.
The core message in Gnanam's insightful speech provided vital insights to the audience towards incorporating family businesses with corporate entities.
Thanking the speaker, SLIM Vice President Mr. Pradeep Edward said that the thought provoking speech added immense value to the SLIM - ESF. He also took the opportunity to thank NDB bank for sponsoring this successful event.
Commenting on the importance of ESF as a platform to provide professional marketers with vital clues to fine-tune their businesses to be dynamic and sustainable, SLIM CEO Mr. SanathSenanayake further added, “SLIM as the foremost mentoring institute in Marketing in the country introduced ESF to offer an opportunity for professional marketers to learn from the experiences of the veterans in the field.
