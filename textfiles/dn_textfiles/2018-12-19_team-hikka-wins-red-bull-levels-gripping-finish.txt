Team Hikka wins Red Bull Levels in gripping finish

The 4th edition of Red Bull Levels, held recently greeted its competitors with a bright and sunny morning to get things going in full swing on the beach. 50 teams were ready to take on the toughest obstacle course that tested teams’ strength, grit, stamina and team work all whilst experiencing two native trades of Sri Lanka – toddy tapping and stilt fishing.
Team Hikka stole the show delivering a deserved podium finish as they claimed the Champions spot of the 2018 edition of Red Bull Levels. Their journey to the finals was challenging as the team faced tough competition and ferocious waves but the final round proved their winning moment with an overall explosive display from the whole team clinching their winning title.
Team Hikka with their stand out performance earned them both Champions title and the bragging rights. Team Bentota Association came in second whilst Team Avani was relegated to third place. “Winning Red Bull Levels means everything to us,” said captain of Team Hikka.
He also added “This was more than a race. The course was tiring and hardcore and we have never faced anything like this. Each round required us to re-strategize and keep focused. The whole concept of stilt fishing and toddy tapping combined with the rough waves is beyond what someone can imagine. You must experience it first-hand.”
Red Bull Levels is an event designed to cater to anyone with various fitness levels with almost no barrier to entry, making the event accessible to anyone with a sense of adventure. The event this year incorporated two courses each with five stilts of varying heights to climb.
