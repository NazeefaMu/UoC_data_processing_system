Citizens' Mail

Good Governance at work
Re-appointment of JVP MP Sunil Handunneththi as the COPE Chairman, clearly indicates the clean and corrupt-free politics of Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, the one and only exemplary political party which has almost all the corrupt-free, honest and peoplised true Sri Lankans.
Besides, I again appreciate the MP Dayasiri Jayasekara who proposed the name of the COPE Chairman, and my second thank goes to Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe for proposing the name of SLFP-Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanne for the post of Chairman of COPA (Committee on Public Accounts), at the recently held COPE meeting.
We, as general public in Sri Lanka are happy to mention that we clearly notice and experience that most often law courts, police stations and many other state institutions are functioning without any politicians interferences. The best example for this is that the Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam’s urging the Chief Ministers of all Provinces to stop meddling with transferring, attaching and appointing principals to provincial schools. He has reportedly said that there are many politically appointed principals in schools and some of them, he says, influence parents to organize protests and demonstrations against administrative decisions.
Another good and exemplary service of the police is that the Arachchikattuwa Police, in Puttalam, arresting the son of minister (UNP) Palitha Range Bandara, who had caused heavy damages to a house when he was driving his vehicle under the influence of liquor.
We therefore salute this Yahapalana Government, as long as the Police and the other law-abiding institutes, that honestly and justly function without any political influences.
