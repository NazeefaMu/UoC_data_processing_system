Mövenpick  introduces  Ramadan  buffet

Ramadan is the most sacred month of the year in Islamic culture and Muslims observe the month of Ramadan which is also a time for sacrifice, renunciation and spiritual growth. During Ramadan, observant Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset and they break fast with water and dates, followed by prayers and a meal called Ifthar. Not only does a Ramadan buffet give you and your loved ones a chance to spend time together, but it also provides a moment of togetherness that is all too fleeting in this hurried digital age.

Sharing a meal to break fast together, is a beautiful tradition. Combining this time-honoured tradition of Ifthar with the convenience of city living, Mövenpick Hotel Colombo will be introducing an Arabic Ifthar promotion from May 15 –June 14 at AYU, the all-day dining restaurant.
The Ifthar buffet will serve both traditional Middle Eastern dishes and international cuisine, together with a sumptuous selection of Arabic dishes including baba ghanoush, Arabic cheeses, breads and other specialities complemented by fresh juices.
Desserts will include a selection of Baklava, Muhallebi, rice kheer and assorted Arabic delights.
