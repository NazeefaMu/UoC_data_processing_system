Kataragama voters urge to end monkey menace

The residents of the Kataragama Pradeshiya Sabha have made a unique appeal to the candidates running for their local government.
They have asked that the future public representatives put an end to their struggles with the local monkey population. The monkeys in the area, numbered to be around 3,000 in population have become a menace in Kataragama. The people complain that the monkeys visit their homes daily to wreak havoc and even break the television antennas in many of their roofs.
The farmers complain that they cannot grow any produce, be it in their fields or home gardens as the monkeys have taken to destroying all their crops. Due to these problems, the farmers have stopped cultivating in Kataragama and Sella Kataragama.
The public have proposed that the monkeys be taken to another area or a sterilization programme similar to controlling the street dog population be carried out to control the rapid increase in monkey population.
The voters have promised to cast their vote to whichever candidate that solves their monkey problem.
