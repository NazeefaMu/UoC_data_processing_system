Chandimal’s dogged ton puts his detractors in the shade

Dinesh Chandimal, after a few hiccups came good at last. Sri Lanka were looking down the gun barrel with Kaushal Silva, Thirimanne and the wonder boy Kusal Mendis back in the hatch for a mere 61 runs. Thrimanne’s endless opportunities given to him seems to never end. He succumbed to the wiles of Yasir Shah quite meekly. Kaushal Silva coming back to the scene after a while, could not make use of the opportunity although he stuck around facing 58 balls, when Amir and Abbas were making the ball talk. Mendis is also going through a bad patch, one wonders whether his focus has gone haywire, a well earned rest would do him a world of good.
It looked as if another “Lambs led to slaughter’ was in the offing” and with the experience of the setbacks since of late, the depression surfaced again. The Sri Lankan’s were gutted by now and Dimuth Karunaratne, always the unsung hero weathered the storm in his usual unruffled manner, and with Mendis back in the hutch, in strode Chandimal (a cloud hanging over him due to manipulations which were really uncalled for) to join Karunaratne.
During the early stages of their partnership Karunaratne was more at home with the proceedings with his prominant onside play, although he missed quite a few deliveries which nearly kissed the outside edge of the bat. Chandimal was locked in his shell for quite some time and he was determined not to swish outside the off stump, which has caused his undoing many a time, very few boundaries came along from his broad bat and gave the impression that he was going to keep his wicket at any cost , come what may.
This partnership meandered along, and they managed to put together 100 runs and Sri Lanka was well out of the woods by then. But Karunaratne was stuck at 93 due to tight field settings and accurate bowling. He tried to break the shackles drove the ball towards long on and drove too hard and came darting down the wicket and Chandimal (ball watching or not) would have committed suicide if he ran towards the other end. Lo and behold Karunaratne was left high and dry and was runout. The gentle Old Josephian showed no malice when he walked back to the pavilion showing his true pedigree, perhaps he was hard done by the run out. During this period of play, some of the TV commentators ours in particular were accusing Chandimal for the run out which was not quite fair.
Whilst Chandimal was holding the fort in came Dickwella, and straightaway he was on song, dancing laterally on the crease bamboozling the young Pakistani pace bowlers and cheekily picking the gaps at will going his merry way and he blasted 83 runs in no time. His innings was of great value to Sri Lanka because it put the Pakistani bowlers off balance. By now the Pakistani fielders were baking in the sun like hot cross buns. Dilruwan Perera joined Chandimal and by now the skipper’s crisp cover drives were evading the fielders whereas before it found them. Perera robust in build and courage to match was a good ally to the skipper.
Perera is no slouch with the bat because he got a 95 on his Test debut against Pakistan at UAE in January 2014. It is interesting to note that Perera in 2007 made his ODI debut as an opening batsman and was left in the back burner for 7 long years, so was Chamara Silva a brilliant fielder and an attacking bat who put Shane Warne to the sword at the Wanathamulla Oval and what made the people ‘up above ignore’ this gifted cricketer is another mystery. They both played for Panadura Sports Club is another matter to contend with! Perera batted with guts survived the DRS’s and played the lofted drives with power, he looked stolid which was the order of the day.
Chandimal’s 372 ball knock had 14’s and his strike rate was 41.66, not only was his concentration admirable his stamina was tremendous and no running repairs were observed during his knock.
Fitness count in international cricket and under the baking conditions in UAE, it had to be the survival of the fittest, so Chandimal skippering the side fitted the bill perfectly. Still one wonders if he fails the next time will he be shown the door!
