Public warned of bottled water racket

Vans selling bottled water are flooding the villages and towns in remote parts to cash in on the drinking water scarcity caused by the long drought. The public should be vigilant to ensure that they do not fall victim to fraudsters who try to cheat them by selling inferior, unhygienic water, Public Health Officials warn.
They said those who buy bottled water should ensure that they purchase water in bottles with a sealed cap bearing the SLS certificate on the label.
