Civilisation is calling

History of Civilizations across the world reveals that towns originated in the major riverine civilizations such as Mesopotamia located in between the river basins of Tigris and Euphrates, Egyptian civilization in the Nile river valley, Harappa in the Indus River Valley in modern day Pakistan and northern India and in China the riverine civilizations found by the river valleys of Hwang Ho and Yangzi.
These unique civilizations emerged in river valleys due to the fact that hunter gatherers found it convenient to settle down in river valleys due to numerous reasons. They learnt how to domesticate food crops and animals. Over the years, both men and women in the riverine civilizations experienced the annual floods and adjusted themselves to the vagaries of weather patterns and climatic changes.
Rivers provided the inhabitants of river valleys water which was indispensable for the development of agriculture, and in addition the most essential requirement for the human and the animal survival. Annual floods of the rivers deposited alluvial soil on the flood plains which facilitated the cultivation of excess of food crops more than what was required to feed the riverine communities.
Availability of excess of agricultural products in the riverine civilizations paved the way for the rest of the members of these societies to concentrate on non-agricultural ventures for their livelihoods.
The urban culture that emerged in the Indus River Valley and the surrounding area was known as Harappa which was excavated in the third millennium B.C. on the banks of Ravi River which was a tributary of Indus River. Indus Valley Civilization is also known as Harappa Civilization as it was the first city to be excavated in the Indus River Valley. In 1861 Archaeological Survey of India under the British Colonial Administration initiated the excavations of Harappa and Mohenjo- Daro the two major cities of Indus River Valley.
Pre-urban to the mature urban
In addition to the major cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro,the ruins of other towns excavated in the Indus Valley were Kot Diji (Sind), Kalibangan (Rajastan), Rupar (Punjab), Rakhigarhi, Banawali, Mitathal (Haryana), ports of Lothal and Dholavira, Surkotada (Gujarat). Another location yet to be excavated is Ganweriwala (Bahawalpur).
The extent of the land area covered by larger cities was around hundred hectares and smaller towns were found to be half of that size. Total land area influenced by Harappan Civilization was around 1.3 million square kilometres or 502,006 square miles. Harappa Civilization was divided into different periods. This division was made from the late fourth millennium and continued to 2,600 B.C. The Mature Harappan period from 2,600 B.C. to 1900 B.C. and the Late Harappan to 1750 B.C. The period known as Early Harappan was preferred rather than Pre Harappan period due its continuation towards the Mature Harappan period. The series of town-ships found scattered in the Bolan area such as Mehrgarh, Pirak and Nowshehra and the settlements at Harappa had shown a unique and speedy transition from the pre-urban to the mature urban and finally towards the declining phase of the civilization.
Harappan society which was the earliest urban society in India brought power and wealth to the Indus River Valley. The world’s highest mountains of Hindu Kush and the Himalayas drained water to the Indus river from torrential rain and melting snow which contributed immensely in the formation of an agricultural society in the Indus valley.
Surplus of Agricultural products fed the city dwellers of the two major cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro. Archaeologists had excavated about 1500 Harappan settlements along the Indus River valley. As a direct result of increased agricultural yields the population also grew rapidly and by 3000B.C. Neolithic villages in the Indus valley gradually transformed into thriving urban cities. The early inhabitants of the Indus River valley cultivated wheat and barley. After the flood receded they collected the harvests in the following spring.
Meat obtained from domesticated herds of cattle, sheep and goats supplemented their staple food comprised of barley and wheat. The Urban splendor of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro could be attributed to the rural wealth provided by the Indus River Valley inhabitants.
Brick platforms
Archaeological excavations carried out in the City of Mohenjo- Daro (‘Mound of the Dead Man’) built around 2,500 B.C. and located in Larkana District in the province of Sind in Pakistan. Excavations carried out In Mohenjo-Daro brought to light that Goldsmiths, Potters, Weavers, Masons and Architects were among other professionals who ran their business centres that lined the ancient streets in the ancient city of Mohenjo-Daro. Modern name of Mohenjo-Daro had been given different meanings such as ‘Mount of Mohan’ and Mohan is identified as Krishna and Mound of the Dead Man.
Iravatham Mahadevan an archaeologist analyzing a Mohenjo –Daro Seal believed the city’s ancient name could have been ‘Kukkutarama’ having the connotation ‘The City of Cockerel’. Ancient city of Mohenjo -Daro was famous for the domestication of chicken for ritual purposes. The ancient cities of Harbappa and Mohenjo –Daro represented highly sophisticated knowledge of city planning and maintenance. The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro were divided into small Citadel area to the west where important institutions beneficial for the maintenance of civic life located including the shrines used for public rituals.
Larger residential areas were found in the eastern side of the city. Harappan city planners appeared to have paid greater attention on maintaining urban order and an efficient economic system of management of lands, labour and water. Foundation for the buildings of the Citadel was made out of man-made brick platforms as a safety measure against floods because the majority of the cities were located on the banks of Indus river and its tributaries. Rivers facilitated the trade and exchange of the numerous products of Indus River Valley and also in obtaining the raw material from the neighbouring regions.
Archaeological findings
Grid pattern was followed in the city planning of the Harappa Civilization. The public buildings and big houses were built on the streets while the modest houses were built on the lanes. Stones were not used as a building material in the Indus River Valley Civilization instead burnt bricks and sun-dried bricks and of equal size had been used extensively in the Cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro.
Both Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had city walls, a fortified citadel and a large granary. The granary would have served both as the centre for the collection of and redistribution of taxes paid in the form of grain.
In both the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro there were market places, temples, public buildings and extensive residential districts required human labour. After analyzing the archaeological findings of these two ancient cities, archaeologists came to the conclusion that Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa were the earliest known examples of deliberately planned well managed cities. Houses had been built in Harappa taking into consideration the environmental conservation. Houses had been laid out to protect the residents from noise pollution and the protection of residential privacy. Residents of these cities had their own water wells both for the sanitary purposes and ritual practices.
In the city of Harappa ruins had been excavated of a great granary of 169 feet by 135 feet. Two other rooms had also been found attached to the granary with a common courtyard. Two rooms were believed to have been used by the workers or the slaves engaged in thrashing the corn to be stored in the granary.
