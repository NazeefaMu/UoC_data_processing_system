Unleash a Tremendous Success

 
Colombo witnessed a one-of-a-kind dog show, Unleash!, the All-Breed Fun Show organized by the Ceylon Kennel Club and sponsored by leading dog food provider, Pedigree on November 1 at the Excel World, Colombo 2. A unique concept launched by world-renowned, Mumbai-based dog handler Shirin Merchant, Unleash provides a platform to dogs of all breeds, genders and sizes to participate and compete, empowering every dog to be a winner.
With exciting activities for the dogs such as the 40 Yard Dash, the Chocolate Ice Cream Eating Contest, the Waggiest Tail and so much more, dog owners too were given a chance to compete in contests such as the Balloon in the Legs Race and Water Cup Balancing Race, ensuring that man and dog both had a wonderful time at Unleash.
