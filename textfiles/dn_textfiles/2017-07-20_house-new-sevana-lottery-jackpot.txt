House for new Sevana Lottery jackpot

A house will be offered as the jackpot for the new Sevana Lottery draw scheduled to be on July 27.
The proposal made by Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake, was approved by Cabinet on Tuesday.
He also proposed that a house equipped with all facilities, either close to Colombo or any other urban area be bought for this purpose from an institution recommended by the Ministry of Housing and Construction and National Housing Development Authority. Furthermore it was also proposed that contributions from the lottery sale be sent to the Sevana Fund. The Sevana lottery was launched in June this year along with the opening of the “Sandapahanagama” village at Mirajjawa village in the Hambantota District.
