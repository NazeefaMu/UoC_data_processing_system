‘Hakkapatas’ preys elephant

A carcass of a five-year-old elephant that had fallen victim to a 'hakkapatas' explosive was found at Ulankulam in Palamottai, Vavuniya on August 18, a spokesman for the Vavuniya Wildlife Office said.
Kilinochchi Veterinary Surgeon Dr. B. Giridaran, who held the post-mortem reported that the death was due to mouth injuries caused by an explosive which prevented the elephant from consuming food for a long period. Wildlife officials are conducting investigations.
