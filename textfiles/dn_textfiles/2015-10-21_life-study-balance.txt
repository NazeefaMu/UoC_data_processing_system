Life-study balance

So you have finally decided on a study or vocational course that you think you might like and which will one day help you to launch a career. But there is a lot more to do before you plunge headlong into these uncharted waters.
Whatever you do, chances are that you will have to attend lectures and even practicals. Therefore the most important thing is to select a good study course and a companion institution to which you can go for lectures. Note that for some courses, such as accountancy, the course/exam provider and lecture provider are often one and the same. Printed study materials too are available from the same institutes, apart from online tutorials and help. You can also order physical materials online which will be delivered to your doorstep, which could actually be cheaper than buying them off the shelf in Sri Lanka.
But even in this case, third party lecture facilities are available from prominent educational institutions. If what you get from the particular institute itself is not adequate in your opinion, you can seek help from these organisations. But do remember that the tuition fees can often be hefty, so you will have to think twice before opening your wallet. If your particular course calls for practicals (such as motor vehicle mechanism and repair), select a very good, reputed institution that has all the facilities.
One can obviously study online these days, so regardless of your course of study make sure that you have a fairly good idea of the online resources available. If you study accountancy as per the aforementioned example, just Googling the words Accountancy Studies will give you a list of online official (institute's own) and unofficial third party resources which will help you to broaden your knowledge further. Some sites do offer one on one help with other students and teachers (some are free, while others levy fees) over Skype, Viber or email. It is worth your time to explore these options and make an investment in a laptop or smartphone (if you haven't already got one) to get online resources right to your screen. It is also a wise idea to invest in an inexpensive Dictaphone or digital voice recorder to record the lectures, especially if they speak fairly fast and you have a hard time catching up by using a conventional pen.
You should also look for likeminded friends who are willing to do the same course(s) together. It is ideal if you have such friends who want to begin the same course with you. But even if you do not have such friends at the start, when you attend lectures at a given institution, you will form many friendships that will help you over the course of the course, so to speak. This way, even if you miss a class, you can always rely on your friends to get those all-important notes. You will be able to study together and also do group assignments together, which help memorize study contents more easily.
Do look for guidance from friends, relatives and mentors who have already "gone through the mill" and successfully completed these courses. They will be able to offer you countless tips to on how to get things right and answer the questions or face practical assignments correctly. Their advice will come in handy as you go on with the course of your choice. Ask them as to what made them tick at exam time. You can also get a good idea of the career options available in the real world if you analyse their present vocations.
It helps if you read articles in the newspapers and on the Web constantly about the latest global developments in the particular course you follow. Thus you will have an enviable advantage over the other students who are limited to "book knowledge". For example, if you follow motor mechanism, reading about the latest developments such as the hydrogen-powered cars from Toyota and Hyundai will give you a head start over the other students - it does not matter if questions on such matters are not presented at the examinations. What matters is that you gain additional knowledge which others do not have or gain.
Finally, it is always prudent to draw up a timetable for your studies. Leverage on the best times for your studies - this can vary from person to person. Remember, studies will give you a better life one day, but it should not be the sole focus of your life in the prime of youth. Relaxing a bit alone or with friends will always help you to concentrate better on the studies in the end. Do not get addicted to a "virtual life" on the social networks in your spare time - it is better to interact in person with other people including your family members. This will help you to balance real life and studies in a harmonious manner.
