Title: Brushstrokes of Old Masters
Author: Tissa Hewavitarane
Drawing and painting have always been Tissa Hewavitarane’s life-long love in his nature vision. A brush stroke has come out with a sense of history of art of the old masters with their brilliant creations and traditional art and their biographies. Is it a collection is unique as it is a very rare privilege for the present generation of art lovers to know I suppose so.
Tissa has got authentic information as some of those old masters were his teachers and some close friends. He has got round 26 outstanding painters of Sri Lanka. And this the first time he has introduced their work and their life long interest to art to English readers as well as Sinhala readers.
In my career, I have never across any other writer who had written about prominent painters of Sri Lanka in both languages. He had opted to pay tribute to the main stream of painted who had enriched the Sri Lankan art to global standards. Tissa Hewavitarane has taught the young men and women of our day the valuable lessons and the need to know their outstanding work and traditions – as they are the present generation and invariably the product of what went on before them.
This book has introduced some of the globally acclaimed painters such as Mudliyar A C G S Amarasekara, David Paynter, Solias Mendis, George Keyt, L T P Manjusri and J D A Perera occupied the centre stage in world of art education in modern Sri Lanka. The book is compelled in flawless simple language and can be read by any reader and does not necessarily cater for art students alone. Any art historian or lover of aesthetic world gains much more from this classic collection.
What more can you ask from a book of this nature Tissa Hewawitarane has taken great pain and time in studying and gather authentic information about the masterpieces. This book is a ‘must’ to be read by anyone who has ‘itch’ to see the real works of old masters.
This book is available in the shelves of Vijitha Yapa and Sarasavi bookshops.
