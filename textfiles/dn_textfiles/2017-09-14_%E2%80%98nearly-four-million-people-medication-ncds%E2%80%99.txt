‘Nearly four million people on medication for NCDs’

Out of the 20 million people in Sri Lanka, around four million people need to take various medicines for a long time, sometimes for a lifetime, for Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs), Sri Lanka Medical Association (SLMA) President Prof. Chandrika Wijeyaratne said.
Addressing a media seminar held at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo yesterday, she said NCDs has become an epidemic and some people have a misconception on some medications such as Metformin which is not prescribed for diabetes patients with kidney problems. People mistakenly believe that Metformin causes kidney problems.
Prof. Gita Fernando said under the current law, no pharmacist can issue antibiotics to a patient without a prescription but it happens often all over the country. Sometimes pharmacists issue the wrong antibiotic for the sickness. Some doctors prescribe antibiotics even for viruses which is wrong. This creates antibiotic resistance in people. Doctors should not get agitated when patients question about the drugs they prescribe and the doctors need to educate their patients on the drugs, Prof. Fernando said.
Prof. Priyadharshani Galappatty said the medication literacy of Sri Lankan people is less than 50 percent and due to this and many other reasons, a large number of people become victims of medical errors.
Overcrowded hospitals and clinics, lack of electronic prescribing and the possibility of having unqualified pharmacists in the private sector are some of the reasons that lead to medical errors.
