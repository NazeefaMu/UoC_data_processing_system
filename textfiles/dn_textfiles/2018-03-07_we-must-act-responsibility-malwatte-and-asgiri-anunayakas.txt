We must act with responsibility - Malwatte and Asgiri Anunayakas

We have to remember now that conflict based on an ethnic or religious foundation destroys all people and we have to act keeping this in mind, state the Anunayakas of the Malwatte and Asgiri Chapters.
“The Buddha as well as all religions teachers have preached to establish a just society and we their followers, should not cause divisions among ourselves to create serious problems.
Religious and Political leaders met at the Kandy District Secretariat yesterday to discuss the ethnic clashes which had broken out in Teldeniya and Digana. The Anunayake Theras spoke to the media thereafter.
“We may have certain disagreements among ourselves but if we do not control our emotions and act irrationally, there will be disaster in the country and the country will just move backwards”, said Malwatte Anunayake Ven. Niyangoda Sri Vijithasiri Thera.
“We have come out of a 30-year-war and we have so far tried to maintain that hard won peace and freedom and every ethnicity in this country has the responsibility to safeguard what we have won, he added.
The Thera also explained that it was important to control the tumult at present and have all religious leaders discuss with their people how we can move forward and live in peace in future.
The Asgiri Chapter Ven. Vendaruwe Upali Anunayake Thera in the meantime observed that as followers of Buddhist, Hindu, Christian and Islam, all lived in this country in peace, all religious leaders should now think of how we can protect this unity and harmony.
“As Buddhists we believe in charity, kindness and equality and these pave an ideal path towards reconciliation but if we use our ethnicity to set fire to everything, we will destroy everyone,”added the Anunayake Thera.
He said that the country which was built on Buddhist principles, later had other ethnic groups enter its fabric and at present they have developed their own unique culture within the country.
These different groups now have to come together and work towards reconciliation- that was the only way, said the Anunayake.
Ven.Upali Thera also observed that he too had connections with the village in which the murdered Sinhala youth lived and that there Muslim and Sinhala villages lived in peace with each other.
