WRITE to your heart’s content

The Daily News recently attended the book launch of WRITE a magazine dedicated as a platform for published and budding writers aged 16 years and above to publish their work. It also intends on making an impact on the literary scene in Sri Lanka.
WRITE is a brand new initiative which is the brainchild of Chairperson of WRITE magazine Shehara Willie. The objective is to promote a magazine which will further enrich the field of creative writing in Sri Lanka. It all started in October last year right after a workshop of creative writing Willie attended. Subsequently she came up with this grand idea called WRITE Magazine.
Willie and her friends did a lot of brainstorming. They first listed down why they wanted to begin this venture.
One was to appreciate Literature as a path for expression, empathy and enlightenment. The other reason was to inculcate a love for writing and the performing arts. And as an island wide publication, to create a network of diverse individuals, collecting a variety of their experiences.
“We want to make it a bridge between differences and a path of diversity and reconciliation. Our primary concern is to Express, Empathize and Enlighten through our stories,” said Willie.
These young people were delighted to mention that there have been submissions from Johannesburg and Chennai. They hope these will be a sign of the magazine serving as a global network. They have now set up their Facebook page and the email to contact the general public requesting for articles. The idea is also to reach out to schools, Universities and Bookshops in all corners of the country to call out for writers.
The categories of creative writing are poetry, short stories, monologues and One Act plays.
Key Note Speaker Dr. Vivimarie Vanderpoorten, published award winning poet and senior lecturer at the Open University Sri Lanka emphasized on the power or reading.
She showed her pleasure at the launch of WRITE and believes it will inspire young people to read and write. She pointed out the American Essayist Arthur Krystal spoke of a new definition of literature. He quotes from ‘A New Literary History of America’, where the author points out that literary means not only what is written but what is voiced, expressed and invented in whatever form. This covers sermons, cartoons, features, photographs, movies and war memorials.
“So if you accept this definition of literature, then books of course will matter to us. But perhaps not in the way they did matter earlier. Do we agree with this definition of the ‘New Literary History of America?,” questioned Vanderpoorten.
Bob Dylan in 2016 was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. He describes himself as a song and dance man. He was nominated for the prize every year since 1996. In Literature, say Vanderpoorten we cannot avoid the use of the word ‘Canon’. One definition of this word is that it is an ‘authoritative list as of the works of an author and basis for judgment, standard and criteria’.
Cannon is also defined as the books of the bible officially recognized by the church. So the idea of a literary canon also implies some sort of official status. To enter the cannon is to gain certain privileges.
“The Gate keepers of the fortress of high culture include influential critics, scholars and teachers. Anthologies such as poetry, Anthologies compiled by already famous writers also function as sort of Canon. So as Arthur Krystal goes on to say, there is a notion today that Great books arise because of great writers who are driven to write exactly what they want to write. Now Canon formation as Vanderpoorten points out is a result of the middle classes desire to see its own values reflected in art. So as she points out, Canon is tied to the advance of literacy, surging book trade, spread of coffee shops and clubs, rise of reviews and magazines and the creation of private circulating libraries.
“Going back to my initial point of diversification of literature, we can see that the internet provides a huge platform for people to showcase their work. This way budding writers can make a name for themselves without the intervention of the economics of the book trade. However to be published in print is seen as prestigious,” stated Vanderpoorten.
Of course the ability to share work online and in cyber space is one major cause of the popularization of poetry. Poetry is considered a high art form and almost sacred. Poetry is certainly making a comeback, however at University we see that students get very nervous when you say poetry! Poetry online and in cyber space is one major cause of the popularization of poetry. These students however sometimes think that there is some element of abstract unattainable meaning in poetry.
“But I notice so many young people are writing poetry now, actually the world over. Recent trends around the world have succeeded in bringing poetry back to the masses and popularizing it as a genre. Spoken work poetry and performance poetry are immensely popular in social media. Now writing literature is getting popular amongst young people which is a great thing,” pointed out Vanderpoorten.
I had the opportunity of getting my hands on this WRITE magazine and I am impressed with its beauty. It is edited by Vinusha Paulraj and Oshanthaka Cabraal. Being a Harry Potter fan myself I saw a beautifully written article on Harry Potter! There was also an article on the Taming of the Shrew which also caught my attention. Poetry has been given its due place with a tribute to Anne Ranasinghe.
There was also an article on an interview with Professor Rajiva Wijesinha which promises to be very fascinating. All over the magazine are poems and prose. In other words it has lived up to its reputation. All the hype is justified.
