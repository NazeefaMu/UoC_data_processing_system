PM to sign gazetted Media guideline agreement

The agreement to place before Parliament the media guidelines gazetted by the Elections Commission on December 4, 2017 to ensure a fair and independent election will be signed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at Temple Trees on January 2, 2018.
These guidelines approved by the Cabinet would become law once they are approved by Parliament and it would be the duty and responsibility of all sectors of the media to abide by these media guidelines, the Prime Minister’s office said in a press release.
This will guarantee just and fair use of mass media which is one important aspect of conducting all future elections in a fair and independent manner. This could be considered as another victory of ‘Yahapalanaya’,the release said.
