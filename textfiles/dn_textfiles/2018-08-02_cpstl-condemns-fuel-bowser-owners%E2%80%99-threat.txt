CPSTL condemns fuel bowser owners’ threat

The Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminals Limited (CPSTL) condemned the actions of the Ceylon Petroleum Bowser Owners’ Association, which recently threatened to disrupt island-wide transportation of fuel without negotiations with the CPSTL.
The CPSTL, in a statement, said the threat by the association to halt fuel distribution, demanding an increase in the transportation allowance, was a move to hold the country’s energy security at ransom and that it did not recognise the body as a responsible representation of the fuel bowser owners supplying to the state entity.
The CPSTL stated that it would not condone the association’s arbitrary actions or threats to halt fuel distribution, and had taken swift and necessary steps to ensure uninterrupted fuel supply to the nation by engaging directly with independent bowser owners.
“As a state entity, we are committed to safeguarding the country’s energy security and serving the best interests of the people. Over the past year, we have been working to transform CPSTL and we are currently on a growth trajectory. We are always open for discussions, and to find solutions,” Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminals Limited Chairman Dammika Ranatunga said, “However, any move to cripple the national fuel supply, threaten the country’s energy security for inconvenience the public with intimidation, will not be entertained.”
The meeting held on July 17 with independent fuel bowser owners was successful and it welcomed any positive discussion with the association to reach a mutual arrangement that would be beneficial for the CPSTL and the association, and importantly, the country’s people, the statement said.
