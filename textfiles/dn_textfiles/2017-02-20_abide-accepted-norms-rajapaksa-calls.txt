Abide by accepted norms, Rajapaksa calls

It is essential to abide by the accepted practice in making judicial appointments to safeguard the independence of the Judiciary, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in a statement yesterday said.
Rajapaksa said the Judicial Services Association of Sri Lanka has strongly objected to the appointment of Ramanathan Kannan, a lawyer practicing at the Private Bar in Batticaloa as a High Court Judge.
The accepted practice in this country is that virtually all judges serving in the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal and High Court are promoted to those positions through the ranks of the judicial service or to a lesser extent, the Attorney General’s Department, Rajapaksa noted.
“This system of promotion based on seniority and merit is one of the pillars on which the independence of the judiciary rests. On very rare occasions, past governments have appointed eminent members of the Private Bar as Supreme Court judges. Former CJ Neville Samarakoon and Justice Mark Fernando came into the Supreme Court in that manner. In the nine years that I was President, I appointed only one Supreme Court judge from the Private Bar. No members of the Private Bar were appointed to either the Court of Appeal or the High Court by my government,” he said.
