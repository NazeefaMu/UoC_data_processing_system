Even today despite numerous modern well developed the electronic system in the mass media, the metropolitan and village level average Tamil masses are still very much anxious to see this ancient traditional entertainment art form.
Yet, today seeing live Villu Paatu programmes are quite rare.

Without the arrow
Literally, Villu Paatu means bow song. In Tamil Villu means bow. Paatu in the Tamil language means song. Because of this, this instrument got the name Villu Paatu. For Villu Paatu large bow nearly about four to five feet length bow is used without the arrow.
The long and abnormal bow is rationally used as this musical instrument. Very simple language based music is adopted for this art. And a mixed variety of tempo-thrilling music is chosen for this traditional art form. Generally, this art form is very popular among the average middle-class population.
The main storyteller who illustrates the story in a heart-catching manner, a few especially seven to eight supportive members also participate in this troupe, to bring out the theme of the story effectively with musical support. In between, they engage in exchanging dialogue between themselves to bring out the theme to reach the audience.
Normally with this, folk music is also accompanied by some classical instrumental music such as Miruthangam, Dholak, Khole, and Kanchira. Besides these classical musical instruments, a few variations of folk musical instruments are also adopted. For instance Udduku a handy folk drum is also often used in Villu Paatu.
The player keeps the drum in a horizontal position when he plays the drum. The second member plays the wooden block thala (cymbal) which is often referred to as Kashtal. The third person of the troupe plays the metallic (cymbal) thala.
It is generally said that this art form was originated in the 15th century. It is said that originally this was introduced by a person named Arasa Pullavar. This simple homemade and handmade instrument is quite popular all over the world especially among the worldwide Tamil population and South Indian population. Chances for viewing live Villu Paatu practices are considered very rare in this present era.
Temple authorities
Earlier in the temple festivals to impart certain values or religious doctrine to the devotees, after the daily annual festival, the temple authorities organized this Villu Paatu shows. Some professional troupes were permanently engaged by the temple authorities.
Initially, this bow was made out of Palmyra wood and but presently it is made of metal. Because metal made bow is easy to carry. Sometimes the bow rests on a mud pot. The two edges of the bow are connected with high tension string. In between small cymbals and sometimes small bells are tied to the main high tension string. Even sometimes small bells are also securely tied to the bow base.
The main person sits in the middle, in front of the bow and he narrates the selective theme of the story. While narrating and singing, he now and then strikes the main string of the bow to give effect to the performance. ses two sticks. The two sticks are called veesukols. During the performance, the troupe members exchange arguments or discussion among themselves.
Sometimes the troupe or team is divided into two. Even sometimes the discussions are taken in an amusement manner in-between the team members of the same troupe. Earlier the Villu Paatu selected the only religious-based epics for its theme, but now- a- days sometimes Villu Paatu teams adopt social themes for their programmes to bring out social vigilance among the masses. Within the one and the same team, one section opposes the views of the other section.
Attractive folklore
The opposing team is called Lavani Paatu. Yet both sections of the team are considered as one team. Villu Paatu is regarded as one of the most attracting folklore of Tamil culture.
