Ravi K’s evidence: Court permits CID investigations

Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake yesterday decided to permanently issue an order permitting the CID to investigate into several documents pertaining to Global Transportation and Logistics Private Limited owned by former Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake made this order as a part of a magisterial inquiry into an allegation that MP Karunayake had given false evidence before the Presidential Commission of inquiry appointed to Investigate into the Treasury Bond Issue.
On a previous occasion, taking into consideration a request made by counsel who appeared on behalf of Global Transportation and Logistics Private Limited, the Chief Magistrate decided to temporarily suspend the orders issued in respect of Global Transportation and Logistics Private Limited dated September 14.
Senior State Counsel appearing on behalf of the Attorney General Department sought a period of two-weeks to carry out further investigations.
Meanwhile the Chief Magistrate observed that there is no legality to name MP Ravi Karunanayake as a suspect at this juncture since investigations against him have not been concluded.
On previous occasion, SSC Lakmini Girihgama sought permission to get some documents related to Global Transportation and Logistics Private Limited.
After considering facts, the Chief Magistrate ordered suspension of his previous orders dated September 14.
The Chief Magistrate fixed further inquiry for October 22.
