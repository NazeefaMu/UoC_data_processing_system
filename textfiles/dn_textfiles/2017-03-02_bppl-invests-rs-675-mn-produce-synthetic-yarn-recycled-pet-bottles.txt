BPPL invests Rs 675 mn to  produce synthetic yarn  from recycled PET bottles

 For the first time in Sri Lanka BPPL Holdings Limited (BPPL) will be manufacturing recycled synthetic yarn in Horana for the fabric manufacturing industry.
BPPL Holdings, one of the largest backwardly integrated brushware manufacturing facilities in South-East Asia, has invested Rs. 675 million to build a factory which will be ready by the end of this year.
BPPL Chief Executive Officer Dr. Anush Amarasinghe told Daily News Business that this polyester yarn extrusion plant, a first for Sri Lanka,will be utilising recycled PET bottles.
“As a company, we are constantly thinking about how we could do things better, more responsibly, in a meaningful manner, adding value not only to our customers but also to Sri Lanka’s knowledge base. As our nation marches towards prosperity, we aim to be proudly positioned among the top local companies and showcase our talent and skills to the world,” Amarasinghe said.
High imports
He said that currently Sri Lanka imports around 9,600 tonnes of PET for the plastic bottle industry and out of this 30% are re-exported by way of fluid containers/beverages made in Sri Lanka. “The balance 70% is being used in Sri Lanka and later remain in dump yards. “Out of this 40% are once again recycled and we buy one third of it.”
He said that they use this for the purpose of manufacturing environmentally-friendly cleaning products for the professional, commercial and household markets. The company operates four state-of-the-art factories and warehouses in and around Horana. Operating in a niche segment, BPPL is a supplier to leading global brands such as Oates, Grainger, and Rubbermaid.
The company enjoys a strong track record as a high quality brushware and filament supplier to the US, Canada and Australasian markets and is well-positioned to diversify with its own brands within the South-East Asian region.
In the financial year ending 31st March 2016, the Group recorded revenue of Rs. 2.1 billion and a net profit of Rs. 306.9 million. un-audited revenue and net profit in the nine months up to December 31,2016 were Rs. 1.8 billion and Rs. 297.4 million respectively, an increase of 21% and 50% over the same corresponding period in the previous year.
The company’s own ‘Tip Top’ and ‘JAB’ brands of household cleaning tools are currently successfully marketed in Sri Lanka and Indonesia respectively.
He said that the company is building its own Solar and Bio Mass plants which are helping them to lower electricity costs. “The company has invested Rs. 110 million on these two plants.”
He said that he was somewhat surprised as to why Sri Lankan industries are not using Solar which is a cheaper means of energy. “Like us, Sri Lankan companies must look at simple and efficient cost saving methods like using solar and not only save costs for the company but reduce the burden on the national grid” he advised.
He also said that local entrepreneurs must go globe and there are large untapped areas that can be exploited. “You must travel, do market surveys, be innovative and then you can take Made in Sri Lanka brand globally.”
He said one such example company’s own ‘Tip Top’ and ‘JAB’ brands of household cleaning tools are currently successfully marketed in Sri Lanka and Indonesia respectively. “We observed that Indonesia which has a large population don’t have a good brand of household cleaning tools and introduced JAB brand to Jakarta. “It has become an instant success not only because of its price tag and quality but mainly because we launched the packaging in the Indonesian language.”
More exports
Tip Top brand is now available in local supermarkets.
“Now we are looking at repeating this success story in other South East Asian countries. Sri Lankan companies can take a leaf from them and try to innovate.”
