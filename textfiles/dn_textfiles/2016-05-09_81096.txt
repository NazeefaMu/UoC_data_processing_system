Diagnose early and reverse the impossible

Part I
The water problem in Sri Lanka was known before the nation’s independence from the British in the mid-20th century. In the past few decades, water-related issues in the north central province (NCP; formerly known as Rajarata) and coastal regions have worsened, but have not been addressed promptly or adequately. This had led to increasing incidences of disorder associated with water pollution as well as mosquito borne diseases, such as dengue.
Does the history is repeating
Chronic kidney disease of multifactorial origin (CKDmfo) also known as CKD of uncertain aetiology (CKDu) has been present in Sri Lanka since mid-1990s. This incidence is doubling every 4 to 5 years. Once pass the CKD stage IIIB, it is virtually impossible to reverse, thus early diagnosis is critical.
Centuries ago, the Chola invaders from south India destroyed the Sri Lankan (then known as Helabima, Hela) ancient irrigation systems. Inhabitants were failed to repair these large structures in a timely manner, thus conditions deteriorated to the extent that they had to flee. Stagnant water led to a pandemic of malaria in the NCP, and most peasants and rulers fled to the central and southern regions of the country for survival. The jungles claimed thousands of the destroyed cascade irrigation tanks and reservoirs, and villages were abandoned.
Historically, it is important to note that, after abandoning Anuradhapura, kings and inhabitants move to Polonnaruwa and then to Kurunegala, Dambadeniya, Yapahuwa, etc. What is imperative is that all these regions were colonised in recent years from people living outside the region, and are now afflicted with the CKDmfo epidemic. Whether this is a sheer co-incidence or history is repeating is not clear yet. In addition to having malaria, we do not have historical information on whether these regions were previously affected with CKDmfo or a similar serious disease, or some other public health disaster; so that peasants and kings could not to return to these regions.
Problems in the region were further aggravated by the neglect of colonial rulers who occupied and controlled Lanka from 1505 to 1948. If the current epidemic of CKDmfo is not controlled in a timely and efficient manner (not happening even today), history may repeat itself, with the NCP again abandoned. It has been estimated that, at the current death rate due to CKDmfo, comparison to the number of males lived in the NCP in 2012, there will be only 10% of that be live in the NCP by the year 2042 (Wimalawansa & Wimalawansa, 2014).
CKDmfo is a chronic emergency
The escalating incidence of CKDmfo is a “chronic public health emergency” secondary to an environmental crisis, in which the cause(s) is yet to be identified. It also reflects the failures of successive government policies and the lack of concern for the agricultural communities and the poor. Even today, the policymakers and administrators have failed to understand the catastrophe and its socio-economic and health consequences for the country.
The current CKDmfo epidemic, caused by occupational and environmental exposure and geochemical adversaries, provides challenges in diagnosis, management, and prevention. Currently, none of these three areas is managed well in affected communities. However, data from the populations exposed to low levels of environmental adversaries indicate that many years of exposure are required for the genesis of the disease (Madden and Fowler 2000; Wimalawansa 2015; Wimalawansa & Wimalawansa 2014).
Why people live in specific geographical areas only are affected
People who drink water from deep tube wells (where no agrochemicals are present) and ones who have never been involved in agriculture (and thus have little or no exposure to agrochemicals), and those who do not get water from the River Mahaweli (or tube wells), also have contracted CKDmfo.
Among people in adjacent villages who use similar agrochemicals, eating same locally produced food and alcohol, cook in same types of utensils taking similar medications, engaged in same social, recreational and professional activities; folks in one village get the disease, but not in the other! The only difference seems to be the drinking (and cooking) water sources (i.e., mostly from shallow wells). Yet, water testing from these wells failed to identify a unique factor that may cause CKDmfo.
In addition, agricultural areas across the country, farmers use same agrochemicals in similar quantities (or even in higher amounts than those used in the NCP, as in potato farmers in Nuwara Eliya district), where soil, water phosphate salinity and hardness, are similar to or even worse than those of NCP, have low incidences of CKDmfo (Wimalawansa & Wimalawansa 2014). Such areas include Puttalam, Jaffna, Udawalawe, Eastern province, and the Ampara districts.
Common denominators for the disease
Paucity of data on socio-economic backgrounds and changes of social habits over the past four decades of NCP residents and conflicting scientific information, hinder proper understanding of the reasons for predisposition to the disease and what social and cultural dimensions and personal habits and/or aetiologies would contribute to or protect from the genesis of the disease.
The common denominators are that individuals with the disease live in vulnerable areas (relatively flat lands with poor drainage, located in drought-stricken agricultural regions in the dry zones) and consume water from local sources, mostly shallow wells (Madden and Fowler 2000; Sommar et al. 2013).
Nevertheless, none of the factors postulated / hypothesised to-date has been shown to be the cause of CKDmfo in Sri Lanka. However, the combination of some of these nephrotoxins can cause this disease (additive or synergistic toxic effects) even at a lower exposure over a longer period.
