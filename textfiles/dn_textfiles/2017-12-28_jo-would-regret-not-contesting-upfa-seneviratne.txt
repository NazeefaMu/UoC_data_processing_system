JO would regret not contesting with UPFA: Seneviratne

The Joint Opposition (JO) would regret the decision of not contesting with the United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA), Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister W. D. J. Seneviratne said.
According to Minister Seneviratne, some Members of Parliament (MPs) in the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) talk about the victory of the flower bud party, but they have not obtained the membership of that party. It is because they still need the SLFP and are scared of facing the disciplinary action of the SLFP. Minister Seneviratne was addressing the gathering during a meeting held in Ratnapura recently.
The minister pointed out that the fear of the SLFP MPs who support the flower bud party is a good indicator for the unity of the two sections. It is hard to get together, and it is easy to divide.
The strength of the SLFP is growing day by day. The supporters of other political parties such as the United National Party (UNP) and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) join hands with President Sirisena.
The political leaders of the SLFP and the JO have understood the value of unity.
The people of the country have also understood that President Sirisena is a leader who does not give a chance to racism, ethnic differences, etc., and that he is the leader who can bring reconciliation. The SLFP would win this upcoming local government polls without any challenge, he added.
