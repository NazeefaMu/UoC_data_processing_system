Earl’s Reef Beruwela prepares Christmas cake

The Earl’s Reef Beruwela made an early start for the Christmas season by preparing a huge cake for the upcoming Christmas season.
Owned and operated by Earls Courts Management, the hotel was acquired by Earls Courts Management two years ago and it was closed for eight months. The hotel was rebranded as Earl’s Reef Beruwela and refurbished adding new interior, furniture, and linen, new layout to the lobby and a larger dining area and with a new kitchen with an investment of Rs. 650 million.
.”From a neglected hotel we have now converted Earl’s Reef Beruwela as a four star,” said its General Manager, Sujeewa De Soysa.
Here the staff and some guests engaged in the mixing of the cake.
