Anuradhapura to become major soya bean production zone

The government has planned to make Anuradhapura District the country's major soya bean production zone.
The Agriculture Departments soya crop leader, Assistant Agriculture Director Buddhika Abesinghe told the Daily News that it has been proposed to limit the importation of soya as much as possible to enable farmers achieve the set targets under the first phase of the soya cultivation promotion venture. Soya is to be grown in 25,000 hectares. Arrangements are being made to cultivate soya in 15,000 hectares in Mahaweli 'H' area, Huruluwewa and Galenbindunuwewa areas during the forthcoming Maha cultivation season following the long drought.
Soya is not vulnerable to severe drought conditions. Incentives such as the free provision of high quality seeds to farmers, offering lucrative marketing facilities, fertilizer subsidy etc will be offered to cultivators.
“Soya is essentially required to produce ‘Thriposha’ which is now produced on a commercial basis. A large consignment of soya is needed for manufacturing animal feed. There is an increasing demand for soya oil. There is focus to start a number of soya oil manufacturing plants,” Abesinghe said.
Farmers in Thambuttegama Mahaweli 'H' area have overcome the drought by harvesting more than 380,000 kilograms of soya in the 2016/2017 Maha season. This consignment is sufficient to fulfill the national soya seeds requirement.
“We hope to distribute seed soya free and the food promotion board, the farmers’ trust fund in collaboration with recognized private sector dealers are contributing to the soya cultivation plan,” he added.
