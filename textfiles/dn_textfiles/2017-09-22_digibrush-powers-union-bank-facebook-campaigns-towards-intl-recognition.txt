Digibrush powers Union Bank Facebook campaigns towards int'l recognition

Digibrush drives yet another client to bag an eminent award at the CMO Asia annual awards this year.
Union Bank PLC earned the prestigious Social Media and Digital Marketing Awards 2017 for Best Facebook Campaign at the recently concluded awards in Singapore.The CMO Asia Awards commemorate the services and performance of individual banking and non-financial institutions and insurance companies within the region against a set criteria of parameters defined for each category by the awarding body. Union Bank partnered with the digital media agency Digibrush in 2015, a pioneer in its field to commandeer and make its online presence felt among the expanding digital community in the country.
As a strategy, Digibrush worked towards creating mobile-first content, a combination of both, timeline friendly posts and Social media based applications that facilitate upsell services while also acting as an online information portal.
These Facebook campaigns position Union Bank as a growing force within the banking industry and highlight the great strides it has made in the direction of developing technology and customer-driven banking conveniences while enhancing its digital media presence significantly.Identifying the increased efficacy and consumption of video content in the Digital space we opted for a mix of video and pictorial content to engage the audience, paired with Lead Generation campaigns in order to convert users that have shown interest into customers.
This was well received and finally converted to a prominent award at the awards ceremony organized by CMO Asia in Singapore recently.
