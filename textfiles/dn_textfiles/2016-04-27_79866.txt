Sakkarang premieres

Dr Dharmasena Pathiraja’s latest cinematic masterpiece ‘Sakkarang’ premiered at the Regal Cinema on April 22 under the patronage of Mass Media and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka. Parliamentarians, art personalities and other dignitaries also graced the occasion.
Sakkarang is based on the namesake novel by Chamminda Welagedara, which was short-listed for the Swarnapustaka award. It is produced by H D Premasiri.
The plot is woven around villagers of once upon a time who led their lives with utmost commitment and dedication to dancing and medicine. Dr Pathiraja’s filming takes us to the entertaining ambience of nature, respect towards elders, harmonious family life and unscrupulous behaviour patterns of the nobility against the downtrodden.
In a slow pace, this visual narration narrates the vanishing rhythm of the traditional drummers and physicians. It starts with the 1918 civil war when the country was still under the British yoke.
In the good old Sinhalese days, the physician was a dancer as well. He was a guru by all mean. He was well versed in the drumbeats while he could save a man’s life by chasing away evil spirits. On a different note, the nobility strived with wicked intentions of lust towards low-caste females.
