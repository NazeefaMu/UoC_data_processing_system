Fathima had qualified to attend the conference by coming first in the Green Lane Diary Writing project conducted by the Green Cross Institute, beating 7,000 contestants in a protracted selection process.
Ms Mallawaarachchi had got the opportunity by coming first in an interview held among class teachers of the country, an unique occasion where a student and a teacher from the same school had been selected to attend this Congress.
In 2015 too, a student from Ms Mallawaarachchi's class Dinithi Dilmani was selected to attend the Congress.
