Varied forms of  Literary Criticism

Over the years approaches to literature has taken new forms. There are several branches or methods of criticism, literary scholars and historians say.
Take for instance what the New Critics of America believed over a nearly 100 years ago. Their prescription of “close readings” of the texts has now become old hat in certain other important respects. At present, we look into historical and cultural considerations that shed light on the text we read. The critics of the past assumed that neither history nor culture requires much interpretation. To them, literary works form the central focus of study, whereas contexts are largely inessential to literary criticism. History can and culture can be interpreted in many different ways, depending on our point of view. And our view can deepen and enhance our understanding of the text.
The idea of “intentional fallacy” (a mistake to interpret a text in light of what we suppose the author intended to do in writing it) is not fashionable now say some critics. The contemporary critic’s belief that “the literary text is its own objective thing that exists independently of merely personal concerns”
It is true we still need to read closely and think critically and yet we must take context much more fully into consideration.
There are interrelated ideals involved in judging literature and literary studies which is the traditional method. Great literature is, for instance, must have a universal appeal and a permanent stature. It depicts and reflects life in a variety of interpretations. It is basically an individual’s creative ability. It transcends petty politics. We become better enlightened and more humanized people as readers when we read and appreciate great literature. There is an abundance of goodness and beauty in the world that we can all find it and share it as readers of great literature.
The idea of “intentionalfallacy”(a mistake to interpret a text in light of what we suppose the author intended to do in writing it) is notfashionable now say somecritics. Thecontemporary critic’s beliefthat “the literary text is its own objective thing that existsindependentlyof merelypersonalconcerns” 
There is now not only English Literature but Literatures in English. This has broadened our vistas and we appreciate different cultures via English.
I remember a critic saying this: “Literature is permeated with traces of cultural, ethical, and political conflict, to say that it rises above these conflicts is to miss out on how it engages them. To study works of literature but ignore the conflicts they address, and often disguise, is to fool our self- and others, too, if we are teachers or critics”
One other point that I agree with Dr Jay Stevenson is that--- Literature scholars of today face interpretive challenges every time they turn around. There is the text, the context, the relationship between the two, and the relationship of both to the scholar and the critical context. Even the significance if the project of scholarship is subject to debate. Any and all may be more or less important as a focus of interpretation.
Talking of different cultures, one remembers the Marxist critic Raymond Williams’ (1921-1988} definition of culture: “Culture is one of the two or three most complicated words in the English language because of its long and varied history and its importance as a concept in a variety of different fields “
We shall now see what Multiculturalism means in the eyes or think of some scholars: “It is, on one hand, the fact of diverse cultures, within society as in Lanka and, on the other hand, an array of debates over how to understand and respond to this fact.” It is nice to be respectful of diversity.
Literature is subject to different interpretations. Context and perspective are crucial to in the literary study. There is no single correct meaning of any literary work or literary context.” In fact, literary study, like literature, itself, is permeated by culture, shaped by history, and driven by politics.”
