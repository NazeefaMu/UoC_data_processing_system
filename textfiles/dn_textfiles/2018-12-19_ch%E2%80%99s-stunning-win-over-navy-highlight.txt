Dialog ‘A’ Division Inter-Club Weekend : rugby review:
CH’S stunning win over Navy the highlight

CH and FC win over fancied Navy outfit was the highlight of the four matches played in the Dialog League inter-club rugby tournament last weekend with CH scraping through to a nail-biting 34-26 win at Navy grounds in Welisara.
It was the Maitland Cresent club’s forwards who gave a scintillating display under the guidance of veteran forwards coach Viraj Prashantha alomg with the leadership of two flankers cum skipper Yoshitha Rajapaksha and present national captain Sudarshana Muthuthanttri. Their forwards excelled in both attack and defence winning abundance of territory creating problems among the Navy forwards who failed to play to their potential due to reasons best known to them, their for CH ran in to a hefty 27-5 half time score. Ex Peterite winger Anuradha Herath played his heart out for the Maitland Cresent club. Anyway the young former St.Anthony’s college Kandy star performer and CH and FC fly half Samuel Maduwantha shocked the entire crowd present at Welisara with his exceptional spot kicking putting over all four conversions, the penalty and the drop goal as well as his booming kicks to touch. Also the hero of the day was the nippy national sevens scrum half Sudam Sooriarachchi who ran circles around the Navy three quarters with his dazzling runs scoring two tries in the end.
Number eight Radeesha Seneviratne, prop forward Charith Silva, two wingers Saliya Handapangoda and Chathura Seneviratne played a tremendous game for the Sailors.
CR lucky to beat Airmen
CR & FC who got their act together finally managed to edges out a fighting Air Force sports club outfit, by 36- 27 at CR grounds in Longden Place.
CR got their momentum going from the very first minute of play where their forwards together with their three quarters combined effectively to score this superb victory. Mithila Perera, Charana Chamikara, Omalka Gunaratne, Panduka Angammana, Wajid Fawmy, Harith Bandara, Kevin Dixon, Sumudu Rankothge, Randitha Warnapura and Reeza Rafaideen excelled for the red shirts while playmaker and fly half Tharinda Ratwatte brought the win for CR contributing 11 points out of a total of 36 . The kicking of ex Trinity College skipper Ratwatte was exceptional where he had a 90% record putting over four conversions and the solitary penalty that came his way.
For the AirMen Thilina Bandara, Gayantha Iddamalgoda , Jero Dhananjaya and Charith Seneviratna played a good game.
Kandy lucky to win over Havies
Defending champs Kandy SC were really lucky to beat a fighting Havelock sports club by 31-21 in their league rugby clash that took place at Nittawela in kandy.
Kandy who played really well in the first half to lead 21-7 at the breather but could not play their normal game there by got everything wrong and in the end they won the game by a close margin.
Hero for Kandy outfit was none other than their national number eight Buwaneka Udangamuwa who scored a hat trick of tries.
Havies flanker Sithum Peiris, young centre Dinuk Amarasighe and veteran prop forward Dushmantha Priyadarshana once again stood out from the rest by creating the opportunities for Havies where they punched holes at the Kandy defence many a times, but lacked support from their other team mates.
Police thrash Army
Police Sports Club showed their dominance with a smashing 41-19 win over Army at Police Park in Colombo. It was a mixture of their forwards and three quarters that enabled Cops to create this win. They virtually grounded the Soldiers with a 27 nil score at the half time
The men responsible for Police’s win was their prop forward Rasith Silva leading the way by scoring two tries while Nisal Samadhi, Sachith Silva,Sujan Koditthuwakku and Mummar Deen also chipped in by scoring try apiece.
Sachith Silva, Yohan Peiris and Janith Chandimal (Penalties and Conversions) was on target with their boot giving some very important points. Aravinda Karunarathna, Gayan Salinda and Rizvi Mohamed played well for the soldiers scoring their three tries.
