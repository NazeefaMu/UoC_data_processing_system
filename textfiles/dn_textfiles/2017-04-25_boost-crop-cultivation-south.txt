Boost for crop cultivation in South

Crop cultivations in the Southern region will be enhanced.
According to project officials, cultivation of traditional and novel strains of paddy, green gram, ginger, maize, kurakkan, cowpea and other supplementary food crops have been given priority.
Cattle farming, bee keeping and mushroom cultivation would also be promoted to enhance self- employment avenues for the unemployed in the Southern province, a senior official attached to the Provincial Agriculture Ministry said.
Instructions on agricultural crop cultivations, technical know-how and planting materials would also be provided to farmers by the ministry. A prime objective of the projects is extending a further boost to food production initiatives of the government, officials added.
