BIO-DIVERSITY ITEMS DONATED TO UNIVERSITIES

The Sri Lanka Customs yesterday donated forfeited sea shells, corals, preserved butterfly frames and other bio-diversity articles to Colombo and Uva Welassa Universities for their research and academic purposes. Since the selling of these biodiversity related articles seized and confiscated by Customs are not ethical and legally possible such items should be either destroyed or used for non-commercial purposes. The items had been handed over following a request by the above institutions. High officials of the Customs and the above Universities attended the event. Picture by Susantha Wijegunasekera
