Becoming a breastfeeding friendly nation

The National Breast Feeding Week will take place from August 1 to 7 island-wide with several programmes. This year's theme will be `Breast feeding; Foundation of Life'.
According to Health Experts, among evidence based interventions to reduce child morbidity and mortality, breastfeeding is an important intervention which also significantly improves nutritional status, health and cognitive development of infants and young children and protects children and mothers from Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs).
According to UNICEF Health and Nutrition Officer, Dr. Dhammika Rowel, breastfed infants develop confidence and their IQ level increased over 10 points. The brain of a child grows during first three years in his/her life and breast milk helps them to become confident, energetic and healthy adults.
According to the Consultant Gynecologist, Dr U.D.P. Rathnasiri (MBBS, MS, FRCOG (UK), breastfeeding reduces the risk of developing Postpartum Depression (PPD) in mothers and not breastfeeding can lead to various complications when the milk get collected in breasts. Breastfeeding also cuts down the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes in mothers.
According to the Consultant Neonatologists attached to the Neonatology Units of State Maternity Hospitals in Colombo, infant formulas available in the market have several negative impacts on infants who consume them. Infants who are fed with milk powder have a higher chance of facing Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and have a lower IQ and cognitive development.
According to them, the risks of developing childhood cancers, asthma, ear infections, respiratory infections, dental problems and malocclusions, digestive problems, sleep apnea, iron deficiency anemia and allergies is high for the infants fed with milk powder. The infants fed with milk powder have a higher risk of developing diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity when they become adults.
But the infants fed with breast milk get the chance of having milk that change day by day week by week, month by month according to the requirements of their bodies, the medical experts said.

Expressed breast milk can be kept in the room temperature for 6 hours, in the lower compartment of the refrigerator for 24 hrs and in the deep freezer for one month. Small cups with lids can be used to store breast milk. Before storing the cup should be labeled with the date and time of collection. A wide mouthed cup can be easily cleansed with soap and water. Stored breast milk should thaw in a pot of warm water before feeding the baby.In order to maintain her lactation, breastfeeding mothers should put the baby to the breast whenever she is with the baby and night feeds should be continued. While she is at work at least every 3 hours mother should express breast milk.

It has been found that about 25 per cent of newborn deaths can be averted by early initiation of breastfeeding.The baby will get much needed colostrum when fed early and colostrum provide perfect nutrition, immunity that protects from infections and factors that help in maturation of the gut. For the gut maturation, the growth factors secreted with breast milk is essential.
