Healing with a screen

Receiving expert medical advice from best consultants without visiting them would be a great news to almost every one. Carrying previous medical reports will not be required in future. Everything will be done through an electric screen which can be big as a television or just the screen size of the mobile phone.
Today the Coordination Officer of the National Hospital of Sri Lanka (Colombo General Hospital) General Physician Dr. Ramya L. Premaratne speaks about how Sri Lankan patients will receive those benefits in near future.
Q - What is Electronic Medical Records?
A - Management of Patient Information and access to patient information plays a vital role in the provision of effective clinical care by health professionals. Medical professionals can use Electronic Medical Records to assist decision-making and treatment. Diagnosis and treatment can be improved if medical professionals have easy access to accurate and comprehensive medical records of patients. Data found in a record may include patients’ demographics, past medical history, vital signs, examinations and progress notes, medications, allergies, immunizations, laboratory test results, radiology reports, etc.

It can be made rapidly available through ICT to authorized personnel providing patient care in different locations including cross national boundaries. It can also support the collection of data for other uses such as quality management, public health disease surveillance and reporting. Most of the hospitals in the country use manual health records. Serious challenges that need to be addressed will be ensuring the privacy and security of personal and health-related data. The privacy and security of personal and health-related data of all individuals is protected in most countries by specific data protection legislation. The manual patient record in Sri Lanka is considered as a legal document and it is supposed that only the authorized persons can have access to the patient records. Sri Lanka has not formulated any legislation to ensure privacy of personally identifiable health data in digital format. However, some applications that are used currently have some inbuilt features that facilitate the confidentiality of the patient information.
Q - What is Mobile Health (m-Health)?
A - Mobile Health (mHealth) is an emerging term for medical and public health practice supported by mobile devices such as mobile phones, patient monitoring devices, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), and other wireless devices. mHealth applications include the use of mobile devices in collecting community and clinical health data, delivery of healthcare information to practitioners, researchers, and patients, real-time monitoring of patients’ vital signs, and direct provision of care. It is a web based collaboration tool that not only supports the disease surveillance system but also it addresses common coordination problems during a disaster from finding missing people, managing aid, managing volunteers, tracking camps effectively. In addition, the system has the capability to transfer the message through mobile technology and integrate and make reports for decision making. Poison information Centre located in the National Hospital of Sri Lanka (NHSL) provides information to anybody who needs information regarding any poisoning incidence and emergency management through toll free hotline. Voice communication technology is mainly used for the purpose. Voice telephony is used to coordinate the activities to provide the health care services for the internally displaced population.
Q – How popular is Tele-medicine in Sri Lanka?
