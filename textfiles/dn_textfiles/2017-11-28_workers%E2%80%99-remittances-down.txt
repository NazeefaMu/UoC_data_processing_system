Workers’ remittances down

Meanwhile, slower growth in economic activities and adverse geopolitical conditions prevailing in the Middle Eastern region continued to have a negative impact on workers’ remittances. As such, workers’ remittances declined significantly in September 2017. Following the same trend, workers’ remittances recorded a decline during the first nine months of 2017, in comparison to the corresponding period of 2016.
