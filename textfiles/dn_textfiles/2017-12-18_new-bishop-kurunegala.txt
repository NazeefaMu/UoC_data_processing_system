New Bishop for Kurunegala

Rev. Devapriya Keerthisiri Fernando has been selected for the episcopal ordination and enthronement as the sixth Bishop of Kurunegala on January 6, 2018.
Wannakuwatte Mitiwaduge Devapriya Keerthisiri Fernando was born on May 5, 1961, to David Fernando and his wife, Neeta Perera, in Moratuwa.
His alma mater was Prince of Wales College, Moratuwa. His school gave him a sound educational and spiritual background and nurtured him into a good Christian youth who proved his capacity through school and Sunday school activities, showing remarkable levels of positive attitude, knowledge, and skills.
The most important task for a Christian is to give up one's own will to fulfil the will of God. It was his decision to fall in line with God's will and bow down to his calling at a very young age.
As a result, he entered the Theological College of Lanka, Pilimatalawa, while he was reading for a Bachelor of Engineering in England in 1985.
Further, he went on to earn two MPhil qualifications in Sri Lanka and England, while doing his PhD. He was also involved in many youth programmes in Canterbury, England, and has conducted surveys on the migrant population activities in London and also authored many educational books.Young Keerthisiri Fernando was bestowed with the opportunity to serve the Lord on May 21, 1989, when he was ordained as a deacon at a Service of Ordination held at the Cathedral of Christ the Living Saviour, Colombo.
He did not waste time in serving the Lord and worked tirelessly towards drawing the faithful closer into the presence of the Lord.
As a result of divine and human intervention, he was ordained into Priesthood on November 30, 1990, the following year. Thereafter, he served as a priest in the parishes of Badulla, Matara, Galle, and Moratuwa in the diocese of Colombo and Ratmeewala, Wattegama, Gampola, and Getambe parishes in the Diocese of Kurunegala.
He has also served in the parishes of the Peradeniya University and the Teachers’ Training College.
His Priesthood has not been confined to only the Parish Ministry as he has served for many years in the School of Special Needs, Ratmalana; St. Thomas’ College, Bandarawela; and as the principal of The Theological College of Lanka, Pilimathalawa. He has also been attached to the Christianity Department of the Education Ministry, and has been a member of the Advisory Board for compiling textbooks on Christianity. Further, he has served as a lecturer and chaplain at Hillwood College, Kandy; The Theological College of Lanka, and The Denipitiya Missionary Medical Institute. In addition, he has also held many responsible positions in Canterbury and the Diocese of Colombo. His expert knowledge and skills have been an example to not only to the believers of the Church, but also to the clergy, and due to his commitment to Ministry and the cultural and social needs of the people, he was ordained as the Arch-Deacon of Nuwra Eliya on May 1, 2016. Due to his sound international connections, activities, experience, and commitment to faith, the continuing genuine smile of Christian brotherhood, and his positive and challenging outlook, the Diocesan Council of the Church of Ceylon, Diocese of Kurunegala, elected Rev. Devapriya Keerthisiri Fernando as the next Bishop of Kurunegala on October 21, 2017. The calling is precious, holy, and from God.
The Leader of a Christian church is equal to the position of a good shepherd. As such, the dawn of January 6, 2018, will be a special day for him as well as the Diocese of Kurunegala. Rev. Devapriya Keerthisiri Fernando will be enthroned as the 6th Bishop of Kurunegala amidst a large distinguished gathering of national and international Bishops, clergy, and laity.
