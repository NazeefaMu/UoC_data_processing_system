Vap and Katina—Thai Experience
Dhamma Dialogue at the  Gosinga Sala Gardens

Vap full moon rose calmly bathing and illuminating the whole Gosinga Sala Gardens with its brilliant sylvan glow as the sun departed on this exceptional evening. The enviroment was laid up for the leisure of arhants. The orchard was comforting to the mind. Among the other illustrious arhants who were residing there were Elder Moggallana, Elder Revatha, and Elder Anuruddha. They all were moving in to the park where Arhant Sariputta and Arhant Kassapa was engaged in a Dhamma dialogue. Observing this splendid group of arahants was Rev Ananda who was interested in linking with them.
Sariyuth Thera addressed them,
“Dear colleagues, I am sincerely grateful for your attendance tonight, while Sala florets in full blossom is blending in stirring air that disperse in all directions. As the charming fragrance reach your senses, may I ask from each one of you in your analysis, as to what type of a Bikkhu will contribute extra beauty and décor to the grandeur of this elegant garden or add to this beautiful plot? Venerable Ananda, you may respond now, you are the close confidante of the Buddha. One by one they affirmed their views on the kind of Bikkhu who could make the orchard more striking while Elder Sariputta unwearyingly listened. At the conclusion of the round, Elder Maha Moggallana bowed to Arhant Sariputta and spoke to him, dear Sariputta, this serene night is lovely to watch; all have responded, now we would be happy to ask your views too.”
“O friends, suppose a bikkhu is able to live his day have the benefit of the bliss of whatever achievement that is his preference for that time of the day, and with his mind completely well under his control, I believe it is this type of Bikkhu who can add further beauty and décor to the splendor of this elegant garden…”
Importance of Vap Full moon
After offering Katina Cheewara, the Kings in ancient Ceylon, participated in Vap magul ceremony to promote agriculture. King Parakramabahu had offered over eighty Katinas before participating in ‘plough and sow’ ritual which commenced concurrently. The Buddha visited Tavatimsa celestial plane on a Vap Full Moon Poya Day. He preached ‘Abidhamma’ to the Devas, which included the ‘Matru Deva’ or his Mother Deity, Queen Mahamaya and as per the chronicle, she had attained ‘Sotapanna status’ along with another 80 million Devas who attained various stages of Sainthood. Vap Poya is of great significance for yet another reason, as Buddhist history reveals an important landmark; it was on this day that on termination of his retreat Buddha move down to the city gate of Sankassapura. The Maitriya Bodhisatva, a future Buddha became a devotee of the Buddha with a large following of entourage of over 500 on Vap poya.
The arrival of Sangamitta Theri at the initiation of King Devanam Piyatissa was on Vap Poya day, which paved the way for Sanghamitta Theri to set up the Bhikkhuni order in Sri Lanka.
Why Waste resources in the name of Katina
Vap full moon Poya is significant to Sri Lankan Buddhists due to some special events taking place on this day. It symbolizes the end of Vas season, or the rainy period’s retreat for monks. It is also useful that we reflect upon recently added wasteful extravaganza to Katina pageants making it an extremely costly event. As venerable Maduluwave Sobitha thero once stated, some temples spend a few millions in organizing a grand perahera wasting lot of funds that can be used to build a small house for a deserving dayake.
The chief priests and Dayakesabhavas should give serious thought to the late thero’s golden advice. Are those elephants, hired dancers, fireball acrobats and professional whip-crackers are really necessary? It is high time the organisers rethink on the inevitability of using them. Cannot the temple authorities go back to past performance and conduct it in a simple manner? As per writer’s nostalgic memory, in good old days there were flag and flower bearing devotees who walked in a single file headed by the Katina cheevara carrying chief dayaka and a few drummers, that made an ideal procession. Why hire Pachyderms at Rs100,000/- each?
An Experience with Thai Katina
During an official visit to Bangkok some 15 years ago, the writer had the privilege of visiting a Thai Temple some 100 km south-East of capital Bangkok on a Vap full moon day. Taking time off the busy schedule and leaving the city hotel around 5.00 am we took the highway route to reach the place in less than an hour.
I was curious to learn the similarities and differences in the practice of Theravada Buddhism in that country by directly observing the Thai Buddhist ritualistic conduct of Katina Pooja. I reached remote Ashokarama, which I selected browsing through the internet. Thai conventional performance carried out at this sub-urban temple reminded me of my home-town temples. The general set up and layout was very much similar to ours.
In all Buddhist countries where Theravada sect prevailed Katina Pooja is a well-established custom. The Katina Cheewaraya, as per observance is a thick robe stitched in a 24-hour day and night operation. Any bikkhu who had completed a rainy seasonal Vas is eligible to accept a Katina Cheewaraya. All other materials offered at a Katina puja ritual are considered as similarly valuable contributions. Unlike in the Bangkok city’s centerpiece attractions known as golden temples, which even charge visitors an entrance fee, the rest of the temples in the outskirts of city were quite similar to Sri Lankan set up in both the practice of traditional rituals and also in the Lay-priest relations.
The Thai Buddhists like us believed that ‘Katina’ – ‘Cheevara Pooja’, as the most noble and meritorious ritual or sacred wholesome act that one can perform in life; they too think, it is just one among Ata Kusal, the Great Eight Merits, as per the deliverance by the Chief Priest in his sermon.
Very few spoke English there. The Buddhist accounted for 93 percent of county’s population. I was fortunate, that a young Samanera could converse in English reasonably well who roughly translated parts of the sermon for me. The gender ratio among the devotees really shocked me: unlike back home an equal number of male devotees were seen participating along with their female counterparts; it was a significant difference compared to our very high Upasika involvement. Thai Theravada scholars Ajahn Sujato and Dr. Mettanando Bhikkhu believe the so-called “Garudhammas”, the eight rules that constraint Buddhist nuns [Bikkhunis] was an introduction by male chauvinists long after the Buddha. They both agree in their writings that it was the work of prejudiced and anti-women participants at the Councils held after the Buddha. They vehemently reject the rule as more Jainist than Buddhist which says, “a bikkhuni, irrespective of her seniority, must bow down to every novice male monk”.
What is meant by term Katina
The third book of the Vinaya Pitaka,Mahavagga Pali says, Katina originated with the thirty forest-dwelling Pindapatika bikkhus, who were on their way to Sravasti to visit the Lord Buddha during the rainy season. The extreme weather forced them to break journey for two days and resume the journey in spite of the rain. They reached Jetawana in Sravasti, wearing rag-robes and exhausted— their robes soaked with mud.
On hearing about the monks’ tiring journey the Blessed One realized the agony of monks travelling in the rainy season and decided to relax some of the rules for Bhikkhus, but ensured that they are relevant strictly during the rainy season.
The term “Katina” is interpreted differently by two schools of thought, both of Theravada origin. Our scholars consider ‘katina’ means hard as Diamond, whereas the Thais construe the word as originating from “Katrina”, meaning ‘weaving cloth.’ However, our scholars believe that the term implies stability, firmness, or durability.
According to the Vinaya commentary the ‘ceremony and the robes’ was called “katina” because of the merit attained from gift of robes was as hard as diamond. All Theravadines accept as true, that the Katina Pooja and the related performances are the most commendable over all other ritualistic operations.
