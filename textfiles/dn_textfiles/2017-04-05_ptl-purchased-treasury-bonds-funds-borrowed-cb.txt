PTL purchased Treasury Bonds with funds borrowed from CB

It was suggested at the Presidential Commission inquiring into the Treasury bond issue yesterday, that Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Limited has purchased treasury bonds with the money borrowed from the Central Bank itself.
Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunatilake leading the evidence for the day, stated that throughout a specific date Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Limited (PTL) has funded all purchases of treasury bonds through the borrowings of treasury bonds and Intra-day Liquidity Facility (ILF). The information surfaced as the Additional Director of the CBSL’s IT Department, Wasantha Alwis was testifying before the Commission yesterday. He was analysing data derived from the Real time Gross settlement System for the understanding of the Commission. Concentration was on transactions that had taken place between the CBSL and the PTL on February 29, 31, 2016 and on the April 1, 2016.
DSG Gunatilake explained that an ILF provided for a Primary Dealer is to be returned at the end of the very day. ILF is not a loan but free money given by the CBSL to a Primary Dealer, that should be settled within the same day, it was explained.
DSG Gunatilake said the PLT had a total outstanding of Rs.11.06 billion worth ILF by April 1, 2016, which attracted its consequences. He pointed out that PTL was fined, based on this default.
“It has happened only four times in the past.
The largest other violation of the ILF is Rs. 350 million. PTL’s violation is 33 times more than the past largest violation,” DSG Gunatilake pointed out to the Commission.
He also expressed his dissatisfaction stating that, this violation shows the degree to which and the manner in which the PTL has operated.
Meanwhile, PTL’s legal counsel Nihal Fernando PC, pointed out that the ILF taken from the CBSL were all based on government securities and that all other Primary Dealers have followed the same practice of borrowing from the CBSL to purchase treasury bonds. He was pointed out that the PTL had a default of Rs.11.06 billion. Commissioner, Supreme Court Justice K.T. Chitrasiri said to Fernando PC that he will as usual receive an opportunity to question the witness and then he can explain if any contradictions occur to the evidence provided.
AD Alwis is to appear before the Commission on April 6, 2017 to continue his testimony.
