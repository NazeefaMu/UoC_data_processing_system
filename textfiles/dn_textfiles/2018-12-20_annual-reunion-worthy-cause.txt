Annual reunion for worthy cause

The annual get-together of the Sri Lanka Photo Journalists’ Association was held at the Cinnamon Lakeside Hotel, Colombo, recently, under the patronage of the Founder of the Jeewa Foundation, Consy Perera.
In parallel to their event, they helped a poor family in Elpitiya. It was contributed by Consy Perera and Sandaruwan Karunatilake, a famous businessman in the Maharagama area.
They donated dry rations, school stationery, clothes to the family. There are four children in the family. The eldest daughter of the family received a monthly scholarship of Rs. 5,000. The organising committee of the event provided transport facilities for the family on that day.
The mother of the benefitted family, Lali Smith, in her address on the occasion, expressed her gratitude to the Association and the donors who supported her family. She also thanked the Treasurer of the Association, Senior Lake House Photographer Saman Sri Wedage and the Elpitiya Special Correspondent for selecting her family and coordinating the event.
The children’s father had passed away three months ago. The mother had met with an accident while she was one her way to see her husband, who was at the hospital at that time.
The family enjoyed the dinner hosted by the Sri Lanka Photo Journalists’ Association at the Cinnamon Lakeside hotel.
