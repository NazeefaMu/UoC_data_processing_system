Army delegation to Bodh Gaya returns

One hundred sixty Army personnel and their families returned on June 26 after receiving blessings at Bodh Gaya. Their journey was facilitated by a special Indian Air Force flight.
The delegation was greeted with a cultural show by Indian Army at Bodh Gaya.
They visited Mahabodhi Temple and participated in a special ceremony. They also visited the 80-feet Buddha statue and the Sujatagarh shrine. Sri Lankan officials interacted with their counterparts at the Officer’s Training Academy, Gaya.
The three-day visit was a result of the discussions held between General Bipin Rawat, the Indian Army Chief and Army Commander Lt. Gen. Mahesh Senanayke during the former’s recent visit to Sri Lanka.
The Government of India supported the proposal within a few days and added a ‘Spiritual Dimension’ to existing defence cooperation ties between Armed Forces of the two countries.
