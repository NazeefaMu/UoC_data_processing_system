Search and rescue services for fisherfolk: Dilip

In 1977, the then United National Party (UNP) government launched a search and rescue service to save fishermen lost or stranded at sea, but it was later halted by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) regime, State Fisheries Minister Dilip Wedaarachchi said.
He was addressing a meeting of fisherfolk in Tangalle, recently. The state minister said that he would recommence the services, with high-speed boats as well as helicopters. He said that four high-speed boats would be built for the purpose, adding that he would soon submit a Cabinet paper regarding it.
State Minister Wedaarachchi said that fisherfolk were a pillar of strength to the country’s economy and as such, their security would be a main concern.
He said that if Sri Lanka were to continue to import fish, it would be detrimental to the country’s economy.
