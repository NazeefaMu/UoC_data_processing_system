Trade deficit expands in December

The trade deficit expanded as a result of the considerable increase in import expenditure which more than offset the growth in export earnings during the month of December 2016.
Earnings from tourism and workers’ remittances grew at a healthy rate, year-on-year, during the month, the Central Bank said yesterday.
The government securities market witnessed a net outflow in December, while some inflows to the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) were observed.
Earnings from exports amounted to US dollars 859 million in December 2016 registering a 4.7 per cent growth, year-on-year, reflecting increases in all major categories of exports. The performance of industrial and agricultural exports, appears to have benefitted from the gradual improvements in global economic conditions and improved trade relations with major trade partners, which in turn, led exports to expand in December.
The largest contribution to the growth in exports was from industrial exports supported by the substantial increase in exports of printing industry products and rubber products.Earnings from industrial exports, which account for about 76 per cent of total exports, grew by 4.4 per cent, year-on-year, to US dollars 655 million in December 2016. Export earnings from printing industry products increased by more than two fold compared to the same month in 2015 mainly as a result of the increase in exports of currency notes. Continuing the year-on-year growth trend observed since August 2016, export earnings from rubber products increased by 6.7 per cent, mainly due to growth in exports of surgical and other gloves.
However, earnings from garment exports, which account for around 43 per cent of total export earnings, declined marginally by 0.3 per cent, year-on-year, to US dollars 368 million due to lower demand from the USA market, despite the growth in exports to non-traditional markets, such as Canada, China, Australia and the UAE as well as to the European Union (EU) market. Earnings from all categories of industrial exports increased during the month, except food, beverages and tobacco.
Earnings from agricultural exports, which account for about 23 per cent of total 2 exports, grew by 5.1 per cent, year-on-year, to US dollars 201 million in December 2016, led by spices, coconut and tea exports. Earnings from spices exports grew notably by 31.1 per cent, year-on-year, reflecting a growth in relation to all varieties of spices, particularly pepper and nutmeg.
Sound performance of both kernel and non-kernel coconut products led earnings from coconut exports to grow by 20.4 per cent, year-on-year. Earnings from tea exports in December 2016 increased by 4.4 per cent, year-on-year, due to a higher average export price despite the decline in export volume.
In addition, earnings from seafood exports continued its impressive growth momentum observed since July 2016 after lifting the ban on seafood imports from Sri Lanka to the EU.
On a cumulative basis, exports earnings during 2016 at US dollars 10,310 million, contracted by 2.2 per cent, compared to the previous year, despite the positive growth recorded in the latter part of 2016.
The largest contribution to this decline came from transport equipment as a result of the base effect, while petroleum products, tea and spices also contributed negatively. Low commodity prices in the international market and reduced domestic output of export oriented agricultural products contributed to the decline in exports.
However, export earnings from textiles and garments, base metals and articles, leather, travel goods and footwear and machinery and mechanical appliances increased in 2016 when compared with 2015.
The leading markets for merchandise exports of Sri Lanka during 2016 were the USA, the UK, India, Germany and Italy accounting for about 52 per cent of total exports.
Import Performance
A double digit growth in imports was recorded for a third consecutive month in December 2016. Accordingly, expenditure on imports at US dollars 1,816 million increased by 10.4 per cent, year-on-year, during the month, due to the increase in expenditure on the import of intermediate goods followed by investment goods.
However, the year-on-year declining trend in expenditure on consumer goods that started in December 2015 continued in December 2016.
Earnings from Tourism
In December 2016, tourist arrivals increased by 9.1 per cent, year-on-year, to 224,791. Accordingly, tourist arrivals during 2016 grew by 14.0 per cent to 2,050,832 from 1,798,380 during 2015. India, China, the UK, Germany and France maintained their positions as the top five sources of tourist arrivals during the year 2016. These five countries accounted for 51.0 per cent of total tourist arrivals during this period. Meanwhile, earnings from tourism1 increased by 12.9 per cent, year-on-year, to US dollars 385.7 million in December 2016. On a cumulative basis, earnings from tourism increased to US dollars 3,518.5 million during the year 2016 from US dollars 2,980.7 million recorded in 2015.
