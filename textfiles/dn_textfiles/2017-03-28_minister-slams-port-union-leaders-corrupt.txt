Minister slams port union leaders as corrupt

Most of the port union leaders are connected with corruption that occur in the port, but they are pretending that they want to protect the Port,” Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranathunga said.
Addressing the passing out ceremony of Port security personnel held in the Mahapola Ports and Maritime Academy at the Ports Authority, Ranatunge said similar to the previous government period, in this period too there are corrupt persons who were connected to the previous period.
“We should establish a methodology to stand rigidly against those illegal practices”, he said.
He said under his guidance they have terminated most of the fraud and corruption which took place in the port. “But we have not archived 100% success but are working towards it.”
He said that if corruption is not stopped, Sri Lanka cannot be rebuilt.”We will never able to build this country if corruption is not contained.”
