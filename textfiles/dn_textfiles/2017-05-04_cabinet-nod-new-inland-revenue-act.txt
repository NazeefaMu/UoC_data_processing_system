Cabinet nod for new Inland Revenue Act

The new Inland Revenue Act received Cabinet approval on Tuesday and will be presented to Parliament soon for approval.
A new Act was promised in the 2016 Budget by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
The Inland Revenue Commissioners’ Association, however, had voiced their opposition to the new Act. They stated it would make redundant the new Revenue Administration and Management Information System (RAMIS) introduced to the Department at a heavy cost. They had instead asked that the present Act be amended with unnecessary concessions removed.
The Cabinet this week also approved revisions to the Import Cess Levy which would be gazetted and presented to Parliament soon.
Amendments to the Nation Building Tax (NBT) Act No 9 of 2009 was also approved by the Cabinet in line with the 2017 Budget proposals. The Budget had removed the exemptions given to many items relevant to the NBT.
They included goods consigned to the National Carrier, items sold by the Cooperatives, services of a travel agent in respect to inbound tours, services of a contractor or sub-contractor and the business of real estate and improvements in the construction and sale of residential accommodation and services provided by a cooperative society.
