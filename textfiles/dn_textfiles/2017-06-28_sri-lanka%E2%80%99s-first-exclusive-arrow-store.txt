Sri Lanka’s first  exclusive arrow store

D. Samson & Sons (Pvt) Ltd celebrated the opening of the first exclusive Arrow store in Sri Lanka at 160/1, Bauddaloka Mawatha, Colombo 04.
Nandadasa Rajapaksa, the Chairman of D. Samson & Sons (Pvt) Ltd, Thusitha Rajapaksa, the Managing Director of D. Samson & Sons (Pvt) Ltd and Kaushalya Perera, the Director of D. Samson & Sons (Pvt) Ltd, graced the opening ceremony along with members of the organisation’s senior management.
Measuring up to 2,400 Sq. ft. in size, the store features a large variety of apparel and accessories for men, presenting customers with a wide range of choices. Opening with the SS’17 collection, the store offers a range of formal, semi-formal and casual menswear, including varieties of shirts, such as 4-in-1, seamless shirts and anti-UV. The store will feature Arrow Sport, the brand’s leading smart casual wear and legendary Arrow Formal wear. The designs have been created specifically to suit the needs of the modern Sri Lankan. The brand is manufactured and retailed by Arvind Fashion, a part of India’s largest fashion conglomerate, the Arvind Group.

Following a stroke of genius by a housewife, Hannah Montague in 1820, Ebenezer Brown recognised the possibilities in the detachable collar industry and began manufacturing collars in the back of his general store in Troy, NY. This little spark of ingenuity led to the introduction of the Arrow brand in 1885 as a pioneer in men’s fashion.
