Jaffna HC bans all forms of animal sacrifices at Kovils

Jaffna High Court Judge M.Elancheliyan yesterday banned all forms of animal sacrifices that are being practiced at Hindu kovils.
Jaffna HC Judge M.Elancheliyan delivering the judgment in a case against the annual sacrificial ceremony held at the Narasimma Kovil in Kavunawatte where several animals are sacrificed as deities to the gods, ruled that killing of animals at a pious place like Kovil where thousands of devotees worship the Gods is a punishable offence.
Legal Counsel who appeared for the continued practice of this ceremony argued that the halting of this ceremony which has been in practice for over 300 years is a dishonorable act. However,State Counsel refuted that claim stating that the practice of such primitive, barbaric rituals should be done away with as permits for the sacrifice were handed out freely by temporary, oblivious government officials.
It was also pointed out that the Butchers Ordinance does not permit the public killing or sacrifice of any animal under any circumstance nullifying the claim brought forward by the defence, that stated that the ceremony was conducted in accordance with the Butchers Ordinance.
Jaffna HC Judge M.Elancheliyan informed the Police that any individual or group in violation of the verdict was to be detained immediately and brought before court.
