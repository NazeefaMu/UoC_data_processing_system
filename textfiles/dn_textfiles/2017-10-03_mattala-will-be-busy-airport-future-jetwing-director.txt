Mattala will be a busy airport in future - Jetwing Director

With the development of the Hambantota Port, the planned oil refinery, and more luxury hotels opening in the Southern Province, Mattala international airport will be a busy aerodrome in the future, says Jetwing Air Director Sunil Peiris.
A veteran of the airline industry, Peiris, who served the national carrier SriLankan in senior management positions, sees huge potential for the Mattala airport. “It has lot of unused land that can be developed.”
Jetwing, the GSA for budget airline flydubai, owned by the Emirates Group, has operated uninterrupted to the Southern airport since it opened in March 2013 and currently has four weekly services.
Jetwing is also in close talks with the Ministry of Labour to have Sri Lankans seeking employment in Dubai and living in the South and East to opt to travel from Mattala instead of Colombo, Peiris said.
Peiris says with the development of the Hambantota Port and the opening of five star hotels like the Shangri La, Anantara Tangalle, Marriott Weligama, two Hilton hotels in the deep South and other new hotels opening in Tissa and Yala, Mattala will be a bustling airport in the future.
He says they have flown down groups for special events such as weddings and corporate events at the South coast hotels. Peiris believes that in the future tourists visiting Sri Lanka’s pristine Southern and Eastern coasts will opt to fly directly to Mattala instead of Colombo.
With all of these developments, the Jetwing Director was very positive about the advancement of the island’s Southern coast which in turn would contribute to the overall economic growth of the nation
While the Colombo international airport was being refurbished earlier this year, SriLankan Airlines' China bound flights made a stopover in Mattala and saw heavy movement of passengers from Mattala.
It is expected that the extension of the Southern Expressway to Hambantota and the rail link too would secure additional business to Mattala airport.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has on several occasions said that the government would also look at leasing Mattala airport to Indians similar to the Chinese harbour lease to cut debt repayment.
