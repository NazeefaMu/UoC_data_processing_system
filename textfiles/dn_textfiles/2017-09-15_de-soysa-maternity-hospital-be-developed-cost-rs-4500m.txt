De Soysa Maternity Hospital to be developed at a cost of Rs. 4,500m

De Soysa Maternity Hospital in Colombo will be developed at a cost of Rs. 4,500 million, Health Ministry sources said.
According to the sources, an agreement in this regard was signed in Colombo recently, between the Health Ministry and Ideal Medical Product Engineering of France. The project will be completed within 30 months and a building complex of seven floors will be constructed.
Sri Lanka needs to repay the loan within 10 years including a three-year grace period. De Soysa Maternity Hospital commenced in 1979 as the second maternity hospital in South Asia. Since then, a large number of deliveries had taken place at the hospital, the sources said.
After signing the agreement, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne stated that Castle Street Maternity Hospital will be developed soon under another project and another Child and Maternity Hospital will be constructed in Kalutara with the assistance of the Netherlands Government.
It is planned to develop Panadura Base Hospital with German aid.
