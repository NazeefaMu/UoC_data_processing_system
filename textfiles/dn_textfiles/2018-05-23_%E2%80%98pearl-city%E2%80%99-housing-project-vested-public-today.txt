‘Pearl City’ housing project vested with public today

The ‘Pearl City’ under the Meth Sanda Sevana housing project, will be vested with the public today under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
A total of 722 houses will be handed over to the people who lived in the 87 Watte in Bloemendhal, 318 Watte in Madampitiya and those who lost their houses due to the Urban Development Authority (UDA) development projects.
The housing project will be vested with the public at a ceremony today at 3.30 pm. The investment by the UDA for this housing project is Rs. 2,888 million. The housing project consists of two 15 storeyed blocks and is located at Henamulla, Colombo 15.
This initiative has been undertaken under the Urban Revival Project ‘Life instead of a house’, with the aim of providing houses with modern facilities to low income families in the Colombo city in order to uplift their living standards. Accordingly, the UDA will commence this project to construct 50,000 houses under the directions of Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka.
In 2016/17, the UDA successfully constructed 2,270 housing units at a cost of Rs. 9,080 million and vested them with the public. Further, all arrangements have been made to hand over another 8,903 housing units for 2018 and 2019. The investment for this project borne by the UDA is Rs, 44,515 million. An additional 9,904 housing units are currently under construction at a cost of Rs. 49,520 million.
The cost per two-bedroom unit including basic facilities and service amenities is around Rs. 4-5 million. As common amenities for the housing projects, lifts, community centres, pre-schools and streamlined garbage disposal management facilities will also be provided.
