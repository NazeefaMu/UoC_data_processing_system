Clean, green and organic

A good home garden gives you mental satisfaction knowing you are eating healthy food. Just imagine seeing a beautiful cluster of oranges on a tree in your home garden! Tasting it, you know that it is 100 percent natural! Garden Talk speaks to District Agriculture Instructor and Deputy Provincial Director of Agriculture Ratmalana K.N.K Jayathilake on Urban Agriculture and Home Gardening.
"If we take Urban Agriculture, it was introduced to the Western Province in 2000. The reason was, we felt that in urban areas, the populace are not able to produce healthy vegetables and fruits in healthy conditions and we also felt that there are certain difficulties in maintaining a Home Garden in the city. This concept was introduced by Provincial Director of Agriculture, Western Province, Dr. T.T Ranasinghe," said Jayathilake
If you take the district of Colombo it is very urbanized. Even the suburbs of Colombo are also going through rapid urbanization. So because of this, horizontal spaces are becoming fewer and fewer and limited. This also can be attributed to industrialization and population growth. That is why they have introduced Urban Agriculture to the Western Province.
"When we take Colombo, there is the high income earning, middle income earning and low income earning bracket. But all segments face a common problem which is obtaining healthy vegetables and fruits. So the reason we have introduced Urban Agriculture, is to teach people to utilize the small, limited, existing spaces to grow vegetables, fruits and medicinal herbs. So we want to teach them to grow what is required by their families. We also want to, if possible introduce animal husbandry on a small scale. That is basically what Urban Agriculture is about," explained Jayathilake
Also people can start small businesses growing mushrooms, growing vegetables and growing flowers. So we can plan out our urban home garden by using the concepts formulated by Urban Agriculture. Here we observe five methodologies.
* Family Nutrition
* Technology Adaption
* Crop Management
* Post- Harvest Technology and Value Addition.
* Landscaping and Housekeeping
Following these concepts we can outline our plan for our Home Garden.
Family Nutrition
"When we take Family Nutrition, you consider the requirements of the members of your household. So you grow certain types of plants under the healthiest possible conditions. We know that in cities there are health problems. So we need to consume healthy foods and be mindful of it. We need to grow nutritious food that is required by the specific family and grow them in the right amounts. We need to keep in mind that we are dealing with small and limited spaces in the cities. So we need to focus on growing more of what is necessary. If we can grow what we need in our own home garden, then we don't need to go to the market. We can grow vegetables in our own environment and keep it healthy and devoid of chemicals. So this will be an organic production," added Jayathilake
This will be a huge support economically. It will help us save our money as we don't need to go to the market.
"Also it is important to have a diverse source of nutrition by growing more types of nutritious plants. Without consuming the same vegetables or fruits over and over again, we need to get used to a variety of it. So you need to manage your home garden focusing on nutrition," added Jayathilake
Technology Adaption is the second methodology. There are challenges in maintaining an urban home garden.
"In Colombo many people live in apartment buildings. Even in some houses there is no garden space. There is limited sunlight and there is a lack of proper soil. So we need to use new technologies. So we need to think of the long term when using these technologies. So here we need to go for vertical planning. We need to think how to use vertical spaces," informed Jayathilake.
Here there are so many methods that can be used. The following are the vertical spaces you can create-
* Cultivation Towers
* Cultivation Racks
* Cultivation Tat
* Cultivation Bottle
* Cultivation Frames
* Cultivation Umbrella
These are the types of vertical structures you can create.
The third is methodology is Crop Management. Here we need to be extremely mindful of the soil.
Proper nutrients
"The plants need proper nutrients. The composition of the soil is also important. You need proper amounts of organic manure to be mixed with the soil. So this is very important when planning out your home garden or even when growing in pots. You need a lot of compost. There should also be a good drainage system. Then you can get very good crops. When growing in pots you need to mix organic manure in the soil in the pots. When preparing a home garden, if you don't have proper soil in your garden you need to buy it from the market. If you do have soil but it needs organic manure, then you need to buy organic manure from the market," stated Jayathilake
Irrigation is also important because you need to administer the recommended amount of water.
"Here, if you have a limited amount of time to spend in your garden, you can employ a drip irrigation system, bottle irrigation system or sprinklers. Here you can take a plastic bottle and fill it with water. Then you pierce the cap and insert the bottle into the pot. Then drip by drip the plant will be watered. This is a technology that will provide wetness. So doing this three times for one week is enough. In a garden you need proper drains to ensure that water does not collect and is properly drained. We also need to minimize soil erosion," explained Jayathilake
Rain water harvesting is another method that we can use for our home garden.
"The rain that collects in the gutters can be collected in a tank. So then we don't need to use water from our taps. This will save us a lot of money. The water collected in the tank can be used for our home garden. But we must prevent the breeding of mosquitoes. That is something we must be mindful of," noted Jayathilake
If you take the busy city of Colombo, vegetables and fruits, can be grown in their rooftops and balconies when there is a space limitation.
What to grow
"So as I mentioned before, you need to select what to grow and in what amounts suited to your family. In balconies one has to opt for growing in pots. Since you are growing in pots in your balcony, you will need to get soil from the market or from somewhere else. Then you can also grow on rooftops. Sunlight is important as there are a lot of sun loving crops. There are also crops that require less amount of sunlight. So you have to adjust according to the situation," elucidated Jayathilake
So this is how we create our home garden. You only grow the amount needed by your household. Ideally you can grow a lot of varieties in small amounts. "You can get a good harvest by using organic manure. Also the plant material must be of good quality. The seeds must be of good quality. The soil also must be fertile. We can also take up Bee-Keeping and get some honey. This can support pollination in the home garden," pointed out Jayathilake
Post- Harvest Technology and Value Addition mainly involves plucking the ripened harvest in the correct time and in a careful manner. Pruning is also important here. The final methodology is Landscaping and Housekeeping.
"To increase the beauty of the Home Garden, one can even grow attractive flowers. Growing vegetables, fruits and flowers makes the home garden look beautiful," summed up Jayathilake
COMBATTING PESTS
It is vital that we do not use chemicals in our home garden to combat pests. There are methods that we can use.
* We can cover the fruit or vegetable hanging on the branch with a polythene bag. This can be used for Snake Gourd, Bitter Gourd and Luffa. Both ends of the polythene bag are opened -the end covering the fruit (which is tied up) and the opposite end. So insects cannot access or harm the fruit.
* Another way, is to invite birds into the garden by laying food (rice or fruits) for them. They then get used to catching pests and eating them.
* There is another way where you hang greasy polythene parts in the garden. Small pests get stuck to it.
* Then you can make use of Marigolds, a flower. We can grow them in many places in the garden. Because of its strong scent it repels pests.
* Neem extract also acts as a repellant against pests. The extract needs to be carefully prepared by those who have an in-depth knowledge of agriculture. It is sprayed every two weeks.
* Another extract sprayed is the garlic extract.
