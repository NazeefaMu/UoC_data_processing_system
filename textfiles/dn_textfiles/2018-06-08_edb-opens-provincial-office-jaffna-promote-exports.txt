EDB opens Provincial office in  Jaffna to promote exports

Export Board Development Board (EDB) Provincial Office was opened yesterday at NHDA Building Secretariat, Forest Office Lane, Chundikkuli, in Jaffna. This is mainly for the benefit of the Exporters and export-oriented entrepreneurs in the Northern Province.
This was opened in keeping in line with the government’s economic vision to transform Sri Lanka into a vibrant and prosperous nation through export led growth and also help promote products from Jaffna for export.
The EDB under the auspices of the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade is implementing a National Programme to nurture 2000 new entrepreneurs to become exporters during the year 2017-2020.
The main objective of this programme is to encourage domestic enterprises to invest in export industries, facilitate regional base entrepreneurs to explore new business opportunities and set up or develop enterprises to enter into the Global Market through a systematic approach and to contribute to achieve the national export target of US$ 22 Billion in 2020.
“In order to achieve the objective, it is essential to identify entrepreneurs who are suitable and interested to join the programme, identify their needs through a Need Analysis and prepare individual Business Development plans to develop them as exporters with the assistance of Public and Private sector Stakeholders,” an official from EDB said.
The launch of the programme and the first awareness programme was held in Jaffna recently with the participation of over 250 Entrepreneurs. An Export Products Exhibition and Business Clinics were held parallel to the Seminar. Around 143 entrepreneurs participated at the Business Clinics and around 100 issues were resolved.
As the follow up to the above programme, a meeting chaired by C.V. Vigneshwaran, Chief Minister of Northern Province was held with Senior Government Officials of Northern Province to discuss the possibility of obtaining their assistance for future export development activities planned to be carried out during the period 2018-2020.
