Sudumenike who was an art teacher by profession at several government schools including at Tolangamuwa Maha Vidyalaya from 1999 until her retirement said her paintings are never forgotten by thousands of people in the country who studied art and paintings under her .
She said she had an early retirement to sacrifice her life to develop the artistic skills of future generation and started an Art Institute for those who are interested in drawings and paintings.
“Over 150 local and foreign students and school leavers are currently undergoing various painting courses under me and I train them to make paintings that depict ancient temples including Dalada Maligawa and Srimaha Bodiya , religious places, the rural life, Sinhala and Tamil New Year traditions, ancient dances, paddy fields, religious processions, humans, animals, religious dignitaries, the life of village folk etc” she said.
Sudumenike says that she has so far produced thousands of school children, university students, teachers, architects, lecturers and also various other academics in this field.
She adds that the completion of wall paintings at the Navgala Bikkuni Centre was her lifetime achievement. She also got a rare opportunity of sending her paintings to all over the world via internet. As a result she received encouraging responses from several countries.
According to Sudumenike after her maiden solo painting exhibition at Colombo National Art gallery in 2001, she had conducted art exhibitions at prominent places including at Lionel Wendt Theater, Kandalama Hotel and at French Friendship Association Art Gallery in Kandy.
She also thanked thousands of painting lovers for watching the three- day `Theli Thudaka Viskam ‘exhibition.
