Colonial Motors unveil Aprilia SR150 and SR 150 Race

The Aprilia SR 150 looks like a crossover between a scooter and a sportsbike, and is targetted at the discerning youth of Sri Lanka.
The distinctive handlebars, the dual headlamp-incorporated front apron and, above all, the pronounced “beak” on the front wheel, characterise the front end.
Aprilia SR150 is available in matt black and white and is characterised by an aggressive and sporty style.
Powered by a 150cc, air-cooled, 3-valve engine, the Aprilia SR 150 delivers 11.6PS of power at 7,000 rpm and a peak torque of 11.5 Nm at 5,500 rpm.
The large black 14 inch alloy wheels with five spokes show off decisive and sporty design drawn from Aprilia racing bikes. Moreover, the 220 mm front disc and 140 mm rear drum brakes provide excellent braking power and confidence in cooperation with the sticky 120/70 section rubber at both ends.
The SR 150 is fun-to-ride like a motorcycle but provides the convenience of an automatic scooter as well.
Colonial Motors (Ceylon) Ltd is the new distributor for Aprilia brand in Sri Lanka. Showrooms are situated at Union place and Peliyagoda. All models can be seen at above locations.
