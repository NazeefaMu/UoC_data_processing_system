IMF forecasts growth rate of 5.5%

The International Monetary Fund(IMF) forecasts that Sri Lanka’s economic growth rate will be around 5.5 percent which is higher than the regional average.
IMF resident representative Eteri Kvintradze speaking at the LBR LBO Debrief: Business Climate Outlook conference said despite external vulnerabilities and concerns about fiscal consolidation, Sri Lanka can be competitive in the South Asia region.
“With the end of a war and recently built infrastructure, Sri Lanka businesses are well placed to benefit from new opportunities,” she added.
She also said that Sri Lanka enjoys permanent peace and good infrastructure which is an advantage the country has over their neighbors. “This is an advantage that the investors should look at seriously.”
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe recently said Sri Lanka may seek an IMF facility next year as a prudential measure given uncertainties tied to the global economy.
Sri Lanka has one of the lowest corporate income tax productivity rates in the region.
As a result, government projections for revenue increases next year look overly ambitious, given tax proposals outlined in the government budget.
