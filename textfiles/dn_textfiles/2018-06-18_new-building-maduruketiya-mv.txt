New building for Maduruketiya MV

The government has taken measures to introduce vocational subjects such as tourism at national schools for students who were not successful at the GCE O/L exam, said Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam.
The Minister made these comments when he opened a new building under the ‘Nearest School is the Best School’ (NSBS) project at Moneragala Maduruketiya Maha Vidyalaya last Friday (15).
“The government has allocated Rs. 7,000 million for the ‘Nearest school is the Best school’ project and Rs. 3,000 million has already been released for the implementation of this project. Measures have taken to build libraries, cafeterias, rest rooms, teachers’ quarters and classrooms,” the Minister said.
He appreciated the service rendered by Provincial Councils to make this project a success. He said the government had recruited teachers to address the dearth of teachers in schools.
“The Suraksha Insurance Policy is a novel initiative taken by the government to bring relief to students who need hospitalisation,” Minister Kariyawasam said.
He said at the recommendation of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, 700 million books were provided to school libraries island-wide to encourage the reading habits and prizes would be awarded to students who read the most.
A two-storied classroom building, principal’s quarters, teachers’ quarters and cafeteria were built under the NSBS project at Maduruketiya MV. Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara, Uva Chief Minister Chamara Sampath Dasanayake and Principal of Maduruketiya MV K.A.U. Liyanage also spoke. Uva Provincil Council members, Uva Provincial Education Secretary, Uva Provincial Education Director Piyadasa Rathnayake, Zonal Director Sarath Bandu Gunasekara, Divisional Education Director Chaminda Attanayake, and parents and teachers were also present.
