COMBANK adjudged ‘Social Media Brand of the Year 2018’ at ACEF global awards

The Commercial Bank of Ceylon’s innovative and refreshing use of social media to engage with target audiences has won the Bank the prestigious accolade of ‘Social Media Brand of the Year 2018’ from the Asian Customer Engagement Forum (ACEF).   
This special category award was presented to the Bank at ACEF’s 7th Global Customer Engagement Forum & Awards in Mumbai on  April 7. More than 620 entries were received from around the world for the different categories of awards, but Commercial Bank submitted just one and won its category.   
The award recognises Commercial Bank’s prodigious success in engaging with potential and existing customers with a largely non-commercial approach on five social media and messaging platforms – Facebook, Viber, Instagram, YouTube and LinkedIn.   
“We are delighted to win this award because it illustrates our ability to effectively adapt to changing trends,” Commercial Bank Managing Director  Jegan Durairatnam said. “Banks used to be viewed as conservative and traditional, but the phenomenon of social media has made it imperative that we learn very quickly how to use such media to reach out to next generation customers in particular.”   
Jettisoning the messaging approach it adopts with traditional media, Commercial Bank has carved a unique niche within the social media space to reach relatively younger audiences with inspirational concepts. 

Instead of promoting its products and services via Facebook in particular, the Bank provided an opportunity for fans to interact with it by two-way communication, providing relevant, useful and motivational information that would make a difference in their lives.
According to the Bank, this resulted in Commercial Bank’s Facebook Page achieving the highest organic engagement ratios for a Bank in Sri Lanka.
