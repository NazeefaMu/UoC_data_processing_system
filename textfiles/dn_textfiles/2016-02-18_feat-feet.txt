Feat feet!

Q: Is a pedicure necessary for beautiful toe nails?
A: There is no doubt that a regular pedicure is necessary to keep your nails clean and to maintain them in a presentable manner. Nails say a lot about a person.
Q: Are there any health benefits linked with a pedicure?
A: Like anything associated with cleanliness, looking after your nails would make sure that fungal infections etc. are greatly minimized.
Fungal infections are common issues associated with nails.
Q: How often should one have a pedicure?
A: A regular pedicure once every 3 to 4 weeks is recommended.
Q: What is the difference between a regular pedicure and a spa pedicure?
A: A regular pedicure is associated with maintaining toe nails by cleaning, trimming, pushing cuticles, ensuring good shape, getting rid of dead skin on feet, filing, buffing etc. A spa pedicure includes all these and much more pampering treatments for your feet. It also takes much longer and is costlier. A spa pedicure which is one that you pamper your feet, could be compared to a facial which pampers your face!
Q: What is the most popular form of pedicure and why do clients go for it?
A: Both the regular and spa pedicures are popular for different reasons. Spa pedicure is much more specialized and luxurious. It is good to have one when you could find the time and can afford it.
Q: What is nail polish strengthener and why is it used?
A: Weakening of nails occur due to different reasons including health and aging.
A nail polish strengthener assists in such cases. There are two basic types of strengtheners, hardeners and hydrators. You need to know the pros and cons of each and pick the one right for you.
You could then make sure that the weak nails get strengthened. In the case of hardeners there is a cross linking hardener and a reinforcing hardener and here too the right one should be selected.
Make sure that you do not get your nails too hard at which point it can become brittle and unable to bend.
If this happens the nail can break more easily.
Q: Does spraying hairspray on fingernails help to dry nail polish faster?
A: It is believed that hair spray helps to dry nail polish faster but I would not recommend it as a habit. It is best to use a quick dry which is specially made for that.
Q: Does buffing make your nails shine? What are the negatives?
A: Many people try buffing natural nails for a healthy shine. This must not be overdone.
It is not good to use buffers daily and I wouldn't recommend it weekly either since it is a risks which makes nails thinner and thinner.
Excessive buffing is said to produce heat as well which makes the nail surface brittle and prone to chipping. If you must, once a month should be alright to fix chipped nails and other emergencies. However you must not be rough. Be very careful with your nails. Also remember that if you have healthy moisturized nails, they will have a good natural shine without any mechanical buffer.

 
Q: Is giving yourself a pedicure at home safe?
A: A general procedure of trimming, filing, cleaning, buffing and coloring at home is fine, provided that you are careful but I would recommend a trained professional for cuticle pushing and any other complicated procedure which may injure your cuticle. Overdoing of buffing too must be avoided.
Q: Is it possible for an individual to get a toe infection several days after a pedicure?
A: This cannot be ruled out and that is why professionals should make sure that equipment and instruments are properly sterilized before being used on each client.
Q: Do men go for pedicures?
A: Manicures and pedicures are very popular amongst men now. It is not vanity but just well being.
Q: What length is best for nails?
A: I always recommend having toe nails short and avoid having long pointed ones. Make sure that all your finger nails are of equal length and your toe nails too are of equal length. As for finger nails, I am not a fan of having long ones and believe medium length is ideal.
Q: Tips to ensure healthy nails.
A: Eat healthy. Keeps nails dry so that fungus does not set in beneath them. Use moisturizer and a cuticle cream daily. Do not use nails as tools. Do not bite and damage them. Cleanliness is important.
Q: Tip to make a pedicure last longer.
A: Avoid wearing covered shoes until 24 hours after applying nail colour.
