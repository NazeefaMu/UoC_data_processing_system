Tense situation erupts at Southern Provincial Council

 
A tense situation erupted at the Southern Provincial Council this morning when members of the Joint Opposition (JO) brought in a donation box into the chamber.
United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) Councilor Channa Saliya brought in the donation to consternation of other Councilors who attempted to wrest the box from his hand, causing a tense situation in the Council.
Councillors of the Joint Opposition also wore black bands in protest of a policy statement delivered by Southern Province Governor Hemakumara Nanayakkara.
