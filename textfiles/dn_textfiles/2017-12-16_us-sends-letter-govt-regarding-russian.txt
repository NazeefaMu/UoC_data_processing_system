US sends letter to govt regarding Russian

The US government has sent a letter to the Sri Lanka government through diplomatic channels regarding the escape of Russian national Farin Manokin. He had been arrested by the CID under the charges of money laundering to the tune of several million US dollars from the country.
The Russian national arrested by the CID on charges of money laundering had been released on bail by the High Court and ordered to report to the CID once a week as a bail condition.
The Russian national who appeared before the CID as ordered several times, had failed to do so subsequently.
Investigations later revealed that he had escaped from the country.
Investigations made by the Foreign Ministry had revealed that Manokin had fled the country during the time a Russian team arrived in Sri Lanka to discuss arrangements for the sale of a Russian ship to Sri Lanka.
