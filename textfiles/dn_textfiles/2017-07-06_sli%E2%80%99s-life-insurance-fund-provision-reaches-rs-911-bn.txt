SLI’s Life Insurance Fund provision reaches Rs. 91.1 bn

Lanka Insurance Corporation (SLI) has recorded the largest Life Fund in the local insurance industry to date with a ground-breaking Life Insurance Fund provision of Rs. 91.1 billion.
The General Insurance Fund, meanwhile, increased to Rs. 16.5 billion from Rs. 14.9 billion in 2015, a growth of 10.7 per cent.
This was disclosed at a media conference held on July 5, 2017 at the company’s head office in Colombo to announce the financial performance of SLI for 2016.
Chairman SLI, Hemaka Amarasuriya, while describing these achievements as remarkable considering the challenging environment, said there are more opportunities for SLI to grow in the future. SLI recorded an outstanding performance during 2016 with Total Revenue recording a whopping Rs. 42 billion from Rs. 31 billion of the previous year. Profit before taxation reached Rs. 13.8 billion from Rs. 4.8 billion in 2015, a growth of 18 6 per cent, while profit after taxation grew to Rs. 12.7 billion from Rs. 3.4 billion over the same period. The net profit growth is 270 per cent.
He said that the contributions made by both Litro Gas and Lanka hospitals also helped to increase the SLI revenue.
The Assets Base also grew significantly to Rs. 176.8 billion in 2016 from Rs. 166.9 billion in 2015, pointing to a Return on Assets of seven per cent. The Assets Base is also the largest in the insurance industry. The Gross Written Premium of SLI grew 13 per cent to Rs. 28 billion from Rs. 24.5 billion. The Net Earned Premium grew to Rs. 24 billion from Rs. 20 billion over the corresponding period.
Over the past years, SLI has been declaring increasing bonuses to its Life policyholders, establishing itself as the Sri Lankan insurer to have paid the largest bonus in the history of the industry. A dividend of Rs. 10.8 billion was paid by SLI to the Government during the year under review. Even when faced with a sharp increase in claims due to the floods of 2016, with claims worth Rs. 600 million being paid on natural disasters alone, its financial situation remained solid.
“We have commenced the outline for a new three-year business strategy from 2018 to 2020 including plans for rapid branch expansion of 40 in the next three years,” said Managing Director T. M. R. Bangsa Jayah. The company also plans to expand the insurance scheme for migrant workers and hopes to have mini Insurance ‘kiosks’ at most all the Sri Lanka embassies were there a large Lanka population.
