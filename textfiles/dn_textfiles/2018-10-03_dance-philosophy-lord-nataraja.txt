Dance Philosophy of Lord Nataraja

Bharatha Natyam is the only classical dance form in the world is blessed with a well-defined symbol. The symbol of Bharatha Natyam is dancing deity Lord Nataraja’s dance pose. This particular Nataraja pose is often referred to as Ananda Thandavam which depicts the entire Panchakirthiya Thollil of Lord Siva. According to Hinduism the fivefold works (Panchakirthiya Thollil) of the Lord are necessary for the survival of the world.
Ananda Thandava is the symbol of Bharatha Natyam which is not included in the 108 Thandava Karnas of Lord Siva. The popular belief is that Lord Siva danced these 108 Thandava Karnas at 64 temples. But all 108 dance Karanas have been brought together in the Chidambaram temple kopura sculptures. A remarkable feature is all these Karnas are danced by only women dancers. Whilst in the famous Bragatheeswarar temple in Thanjavur, the same Thandava Karnas are depicted by the Lord himself. Unfortunately, only 83 Thandava Karnas (poses) still exist at the Bragatheeswarar temple. It is believed that the emperor Raja Raja Cholan, who built the Thanjai Bragatheeswarar temple, installed the sculptures of 83 Karnas of Lord Shiva. With the end of his rule, these works ceased. Among these 108 Karnas, some Karnas are difficult ones and others are easy.
Five functions
Ananda Thandava pose of Lord Shiva is widely known as Lord Nataraja. Lord Shiva is generally believed to have performed five functions, namely, creation and protection in two Thandavas, {(bestow happiness) and (protection from sorrow)}, destruction, dispelling egoism, sins; illusion and bestowing blessings are the main five functions of the Lord.
All these five were expounded in the six Thandavas. But all these six Thandavas are finally expounded in one single Thandava namely Ananda Thandava. Together with the six Thandavas, the Ananda Thandava becomes the seventh Thandava. All these seven Thandavas are collectively called ‘Sabtha Thandavams’. That’s why; the Ananda Thandava is used in Bharatha Natyam, because it embraces all the five essential functions of the creator of the universe.
The cosmic dancer Lord Siva is often referred to as Lord Nataraja, Koothapiran, Ampalakoothan, Adavallan, Adputhakoothan, Thillai Koothan and Thandava Moorthy. Lord Nataraja is the general and the common name used for the dancing deity.
Important elements
According to popular belief, the dance of Lord Nataraja consists of five essential elements of the world which are collectively called Panchaputhams. The five important elements of the world are fire, water, wind, earth, akasham (sky). The dance pose of Lord Nataraja consists of all these important elements. Out of the four hands, the right hand of Lord Nataraja holds the wind instrument, udiki (Udukku) and the right leg is resting on the demon (Muyalavan). Agini (fire) is in his left hand. Ganga (river) is in his tresses and the moon is worn in the tresses.
All these five essential elements are coordinated to five famous temples. Kanchipuram Temple is related to earth. Thiruvaanika is related to water. Thiruvanamali is related to the fire. Kalahsti temple is related to wind and Chidambaram temple is related to Akaya (Sky or ether). The drum which is in the right hand of Lord Nataraja denotes the creation. The fire in the left hand depicts the destruction. The second right hand denotes the protection for all living beings by Abaya Hasta. Similarly, the second left hand is in Dola hasta position to attract all towards him. Raised left leg demands all the beings to surrender to him for salvation. The pressed right leg denotes the destruction of the evils such as Kama, ego, pride, anger and jealousy.
In almost every Bharatha Natyam recital, this particular dance pose of Lord Nataraja’s Ananda Thandavaadorns the stage. And it is the universally acknowledged symbol of Bharatha Natyam.
