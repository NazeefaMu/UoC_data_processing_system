NDBIB Wins Euromoney Crown for Seventh Year

NDB Investment Bank (NDBIB) cemented its position as the market leader and premier Investment Bank in the country by being awarded as ‘Sri Lanka’s Best Investment Bank 2018’ by Euromoney Magazine.
NDBIB secured this prestigious award for the 7th consecutive year whilst demonstrating its market leadership and unrivalled credentials both in Sri Lanka and the region.
This award recognises the depth and breadth of the transactions executed by NDBIB and propels NDBIB as one of the longest consecutive winners of a country specific award. The Asia Awards Ceremony was held on July 18, 2018 at JW Marriott in Hong Kong.
NDBIB recorded a stellar performance for 2017 with all three product verticals of debt capital markets, equity capital markets and M&A advisory performing exceptionally well.
Darshan Perera, CEO of NDBIB, said, “2017 was yet another remarkable year for NDBIB where we extended our market leadership having executed over 40 transactions with a value exceeding Rs. 55 billion. Winning this award for seven years in a row is not an easy one amidst increasing competition and shows that being the best in what we do is embedded to our organisational DNA”. He further added, “Client satisfaction and delivering on our promise is also something that has enabled us to maintain our leadership position”.
The debt capital markets team was also instrumental in creating capital raising opportunities with structured debt products to match the cash flow needs of clients. Kaushini Laksumanage, COO of NDBIB, commenting on the company’s success said, “Last year was an exceptional year for us having executed many innovative and landmark transactions. On the debt capital side, we were active in raising both rupee and dollar debt across medium to long term tenures for clients from diverse industries both in Sri Lanka and in the Maldives”.
Nilendra Weerasinghe, Vice President and Head-Corporate Advisory, commenting on the performance, said, “Year 2017 was no doubt a tough market from a capital raising perspective”.
