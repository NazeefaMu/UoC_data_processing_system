Sir Ponnambalam Ramanthan’s 86 death anniversary: Chauvinism has no place in politics - SP Governor

Malicious attempts of certain politicians to snatch political power through communal ideologies will never succeed. Mean elements will not be able to spread communal hatred and resentment among the people as every citizen aspires to live in a peaceful and united Sri Lanka, Southern Province Governor Dr. Hema Kumara Nanayakkara said.
He observed so delivering the key note address at the 86th death anniversary of Sir Ponnambalam Ramanatan at the Southern Province Governor’s secretariat auditorium on Wednesday.
Governor Dr. Nanayakkara said scholars with great humane qualities are infrequent. Compassionate people light up the world for ages. Sir. Ponnambalam Ramanathan was such an exceptional politician cum academic. He was a prominent personality who fostered and maintained a compassionate vision and mission towards the world void of trivial ethnic, creed and caste prejudices. It is our obligation and duty to pay homage to such a personality at his 86th death anniversary, the Governor said.
He said Sir Ponnambalam was raised in a cultured milieu and nurtured under methodical parents. Due to his in-depth education gained through prestigious educational institutions, he earned reputation as an international academic.
He was a man of practicality and dignity. His eloquent speeches at the Legislative Council were as terrifying as lions roars that frightened British rulers. Colonial rulers tried to suppress the basic human rights of the people. Sir Ramanthan voiced against such vicious acts, Dr. Nanayakkara said.
Governor Nanayakkara said: “It is rarely that a nation gets epoch-making personalities. Their vision and mission pave the way for nations’ forward march. Descended from a Tamil family, he came forward to defend the rights and privileges of Sinhala Buddhist at times when their liberties were threatened. He continued his mission upholding patriotic approaches shunning chauvinistic ideologies and attitudes. With regard to his contributions for the uplift of the Sinhala community and Buddhism, the nation is indebted to this illustrious and erudite intellectual who is well reminisced in hearts and souls of all.”
Prisons Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Minister D.M.Swaminathan also spoke.
