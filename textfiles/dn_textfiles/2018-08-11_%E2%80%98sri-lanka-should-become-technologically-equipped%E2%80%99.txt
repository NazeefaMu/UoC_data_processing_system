‘Sri Lanka should become technologically-equipped’

Sri Lanka should march forward as a technologically-equipped society, Science, Technology, Research, Skills Development and Vocational Training and Kandyan Heritage Minister Sarath Amunugama said.
He was addressing the 13th International Conference on Computer Science and Education, held in Colombo on Thursday.
The conference was held in several countries in the past, including Sri Lanka, for the last 12 years.
"The development of human resources is vital, if Sri Lanka is to take advantage of growth opportunities emerging in the near future," said the minister.
He added that knowledge in information technology is significant in human resource development.
"Considering the progress in the southern parts of India at present, Sri Lanka could, in the future, jointly build an international technology zone with them," he added.
