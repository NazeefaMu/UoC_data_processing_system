Chalani needs help

An 11-year-old girl, Chalani Divumini is suffering from a congenital heart disease. She underwent surgery at the Madras Medical (MMM)Hospital in Chennai last August as well.
Cardiologists at the MMM had been constantly monitoring her condition through a cardio microphone embedded in her chest. Dr. Sivakumar from the MMM had recently sent an email indicating that the patient needs to be brought back to hospital for an urgent medical treatment.
Her parents are unable to afford the expenditure as the total cost for medical treatment, air tickets, food, accommodation and incidental expenses would be around one million Sri Lankan rupees.
Chalani’s father, Nalaka Soysa is a casual labourer, while her mother, Shiranthi Harshani works at a garment factory.
Contributions can be remitted to account number A/C No. 102657129083 at Sampath Bank, Habaraduwa branch or A/C No. 8124458 at Bank of Ceylon, Panadura branch. Nalaka Soysa’s contact numbers are 071-4758595 and 078-8795930.
