Anura Jayarathna appointed as GM  of Development Lotteries Board

One of the most experienced lottery and business management experts in Sri Lanka, Anura Jayarathna has been appointed recently by the Director Board to the post of General Manager of the Development Lotteries Board.
He is arguably one of the best lottery marketeers in South East Asia with not only hands on experience in the local lottery field but also with his international exposure as a delegate from Sri Lanka at the World Lottery Congress meetings held in the United States of America, Australia, China, South Africa, Greece and New Zealand. During his stay at the Board he has been instrumental in creating and developing strategies for the entire range of lotteries which includes lottery game development, instant lotteries and offline lotteries which has led the Board to its prime position as a leading lottery provider in the country.
Anura is a graduate of the University of Sri Jayawardenepura holding a Bachelor of Business Administration degree and also a Post Graduate Diploma in Business Administration from the University of Leicestershire, UK.
He joined the Board in 1994 as a Trainee Officer and in his path to the top has served as Marketing Officer/Asst. General Manager (Marketing), Deputy General Manager (Marketing), and now he has risen to the top to function as its new General Manager.
From the inception of the Development Lotteries Board the vacancies for the post of General Manager has been filled by personnel selected by the Treasury, but this time breaking this tradition for the first time, a General Manager has been selected from its own ranks, which in itself is, a special and milestone event.
