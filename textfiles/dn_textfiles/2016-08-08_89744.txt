Five teams qualify for the final stage

The second round of 2016 under 17 division-one tournament comprising the 32 teams qualified from the first round has now progressed up to a position with 15 teams qualified to the pre-quarter stage of the final round out of the 16 due after they became Group-Champions and runners-up of the 8 groups in the second round.
Despite the fact that only one out of the two qualifiers from Group Q has been selected as two more matches remain to be played in this group, both qualifiers of other seven groups have already been declared.
Only five teams; St. Sebastian's College (A) Moratuwa, D.S.Senanayake College (A) Colombo, Ananda College (A) Colombo, St. Aloysius College Galle and Richmond College Galle out of the ten qualified to second round as group champions of the first round have been able to go through to the final round whilst the rest, Maris Stella College Negombo (unbeaten in the first round), Mahanama College (A) Colombo (unbeaten), St. Joseph Vaz College Wennappuwa ( won all six), St. John’s College Jaffna (won 5 out of 7) and Dharmaraja College, Kandy (won 6 out of 7) all failed to qualify.
In groups R, S and W, the two qualifiers had to be decided on Net Run Rate as the top three teams finished their second round matches on equal points. Lumbini, Dharmapala and St.Sylvester’s were the three unlucky teams whose NRR was not sufficient to go through to the final round.
