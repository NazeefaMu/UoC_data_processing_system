Investment in knowledge

Knowledge has become the driving force of economic performance and hence knowledge production has become a necessary condition for improving national competitiveness in a globalized world. The term “higher education” usually encompasses university education as well as other branches of tertiary professional and technical education. University education, which in Sri Lanka dominates higher education. Country’s higher education has to be continuously upgraded as new technology especially information technology is incorporated and at a time of immense economic changes are taking place in global landscape.
Universities perform three main functions, teaching, research and public service. The three functions are interrelated. Leadership in higher education needs proper culmination of teaching, research and public service. Therefore, the new era of higher education need to reposition in a manner where the ultimate benefits could be reaped by the student community efficiently and effectively.
Challenges in higher education
Challenges have been identified as massification, privatization, and internationalization – in higher education. “Each country wishes to deploy its resources in higher education to greatest advantage – to increase national competitiveness; enhance its economic growth rates; and raise its prestige internationally, while Sri Lanka lags behind. Privatization has affected the formation and the administration of higher education institutions globally. It enhanced the competitive advantage in terms of quality and service delivery. Further, usage of digital technology and expansion of online mode to the rural sector, lack of usage of knowledge management techniques in administration of higher education, development of skills, attitudes and aptitudes of students, lack of a proper counselling and mentoring mechanism are some of the other issues we face in higher education.
The emergence of knowledge economies encouraged investment in higher education and research to promote industrial and technological competitiveness. The move towards establishing research universities, world class universities and the development of university ranking systems are instances of higher education becoming dear to the public sector and also to the corporate world. These efforts have helped revitalizing higher education in the present century.
The University Grants Commission (UGC) is mandated only to regulate, foster and monitor state universities/higher educational institutions. There is indeed a serious void in authority and procedures in formulating policy and regulatory framework and guidelines that will facilitate and expedite expansion of the higher education sector as a whole, together with monitoring operational aspects of the non-state higher education sector that includes private higher educational institutes, cross-border institutes, professional bodies awarding degrees/diplomas and branch campuses of foreign universities.
Apart from this a vast range of programmes offered by providers of many different types. The legitimacy and the technical capacity of many providers to conduct academic training and offer diplomas/degrees are not very apparent. All of them however, operate in the absence of any regulation and monitoring. Lack of such State regulation and monitoring of this non-formal sector is the major impediment to expansion of this important sector.
For this purpose it is proposed to establish an independent Quality Assurance and Accreditation Framework in Sri Lanka to ensure confidence in its awards.
Develop curricula utilizing digital technologies can aid in improving students’ motivation and learning. All countries now compete in a global, knowledge-based, innovation-centred economy. For Asian nations to compete in this situation, students’ educational outcomes should include motivation (both intrinsic interest and self-efficacy), academic achievement (content and skill acquisition), 21st century skills, entrepreneurial thinking, and character attributes such as persistence and flexibility.
The largest obstacle is preparing a sufficient supply of high quality teachers who understand their subject, how students learn, and the role of digital tools and media in aiding learning. Powerful models for online and blended teacher professional development need to be available.
However, we have not made extensive investments in educational technology infrastructure, nor have emphasized using technology as a means of moving away from teaching by telling and learning by listening. Overall, realizing the full potential of economic and social wellbeing involves not only bringing all of each country’s population up to a foundational level of skills and knowledge, but also enabling some fraction of students to compete in the global economy by mastering sophisticated knowledge and skills: cognitive, intrapersonal, and interpersonal. Modern digital technologies provide powerful strategies for learning that can accomplish both these goals.
Administration of higher education
The administration of higher education needs due recognition without any political or any form of interferences to deliver the public service efficiently and effectively. Further, enhancing knowledge management in administration of higher education institutes are of paramount importance of the hour. Management information systems need to be part of the administration. Pressing concerns of the Administration of Higher education institutes need to be addressed since the university system cannot merely function without proper administration. It should be independent and need to be well recognized.
In Singapore they built a multicultural society that would give equality to all citizens regardless of race, language or religion. It is the faith which guided their policies. How difficult it was for a small country of 640sq. km., with no natural resources to survive in the midst of larger, newly independent nations pursuing nationalistic policies.
It was hard work, planning and focused mission led to build a nation out of a desperate collection of immigrants from China, British, India and Dutch making a living to all the people. Higher education played a major role in Singapore introducing economically benefitted degree programmes to the society.
Develop skills, attitudes and aptitudes of students
Develop skills, attitude and aptitudes of students that enhance their employability is needed than just obtaining a paper qualification. One of the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals for Education (UNSDG) speaks to skills specific to sustainable development in the 21st century.
Pedagogic recontextualization, the ability of critical thinking to speak to alternative possibilities and individual autonomy in higher education is essential.
New perspectives from leaders in academic affairs, student affairs and central administration to improve institutes and universities in service to students and professionals are needed. Leadership norms, values, assumptions and behaviours can often find their origins in cultural identities, and how such assumptions can affect the evolvement of universities in serving student community creating multicultural citizen in a democratic country is a challenge with the existing higher education system.
There are various challenges and barriers to be overcome to realize the vision of the higher education in Sri Lanka.
Banking and insurance industry as well as the Chambers could well look after the education and the health sector of this country rather than being a burden to the State in funding. The sector has become dearer to public policy and private investment and it enjoys favourable public support, increased investment especially from non-government sources, diversified provisions, and programmes and experienced unprecedented expansion globally.
More and more countries are showing less and less reliance on public funding support to expand higher education. Further, public - private partnerships in higher education need to be outcome oriented and the student community should be benefitted.
There is a dire need of policy formulation in higher education amidst changing social, cultural, economical global landscape and challenges.
More than anything else, building the faith among the public in the higher education in Sri Lanka is the need of the hour since there is a huge brain drain at present.
