Finance Minister discusses cooperation with US Under Secretary

 Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera, who is currently in Washington, USA, to attend the World Bank/IMF annual meeting, met with the US Under Secretary for Political Affairs Ambassador Thomas Shannon, at the US State Department, yesterday.
Ambassador Shannon will visit Sri Lanka in November 2017 to take part in the next round of the US/ Sri Lanka Partnership Dialogue, which was inaugurated in 2016 when Samaraweera was the Foreign Affairs Minister. The visit is for a regular policy consultation designed to discuss and identify opportunities for cooperation across the full range of bilateral and regional issues.
The Partnership Dialogue demonstrates the consolidation of cooperation between the United States and Sri Lanka and serves to further strengthen and enhance bilateral relations in the widest sense, through regular and structured engagement.
Finance Minister Samaraweera was accompanied by Mano Tittawella, Senior Adviser to the Minister of Finance, Prof. Gamini B. Keerawella, Charge d’ Affaires of the Sri Lanka Embassy in the USA and Priyanga Wickramasinghe of the Sri Lankan Embassy in the USA.
