Cyber tool to track accommodation  providers sans valid license

In a bid to enforce registration of all tourism industry service providers in Sri Lanka, the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) has deployed a new cyber tool to track accommodation providers operating without valid licence from the SLTDA.
This tool scans publicly available online data about tourism businesses and cross-checks them with the Business Licensing Platform run by the state tourism authority.
At the initial stage, the SLTDA will send warning letters to unregistered tourism related businesses in Sri Lanka and direct them to register with its licensing platform.
If these businesses continue to operate without a license, the SLTDA will then transfer their information to the newly established Enforcement Unit of the SLTDA for further legal action.
The SLTDA has already introduced a new online registration service from the beginning of April this year, giving five months notice to the industry of its move to go fully digital. Currently, over 6,000 establishments have registered with the SLTDA, including star class hotels, guest houses, travel agents, restaurants, home stays, bungalows, boat operators, tour guides, chauffeur guides, jeep operators, etc., with a total of 35,000 rooms.
Registration of all tourism related service providers in Sri Lanka is a mandatory requirement under the Tourism Act.
