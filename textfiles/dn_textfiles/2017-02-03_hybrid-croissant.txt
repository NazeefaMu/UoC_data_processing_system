Hybrid croissant

We need to dissect this hybrid croissant. Slice into it. Understand how and why it was created.
Before we do, let’s together pay quick homage to the traditional French pastry: a work of breakfast genius. They’re soft in the middle, crispy on the outside. So pure and brilliant.
Now that’s out the way, it’s time to come to terms with the fact that a bakery has decided to put sushi inside its croissants. The creation is called the ‘Cali Croissant’, a fusion food combining a French classic with a Japanese delicacy.
Naturally, it was created in Los Angeles – by the Mr. Holmes Bake House, as LA Mag discovered. It’s the place that invented the cruffin (croissant/muffin partnership, which is altogether more workable).
For the fish croissant, the bakery put a popular sushi roll, of salmon, nori (seaweed), ginger, and wasabi inside a standard croissant. For pastry purists and sushi aficionados, it’s comparable to an indictable criminal offence. We’ve no idea why the salmon is smoked.
It’s worth noting that the Mr. Holmes Bake House has included with its dish a sachet of soy sauce – for dipping. I suppose that underpins its vague, irresponsible way it goes about cooking, given that sushi should never, ever, be dipped in soy sauce. Or so the Japanese say (not that they’d know).
The creation is probably just a stunt, something for people to talk about. It also follows the famous cronut (though that’s from a different bakery), and a host of other strange inventions. You have to admire the imagination and bravery.
