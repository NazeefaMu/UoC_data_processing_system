NCM against 16 SLFP Ministers, Deputy Speaker - MP

The UNP will submit a No Confidence Motion to the Speaker today against 16 SLFP Ministers who voted in favour of the no confidence motion against the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, MP Mujibur Rahman said.
He said that the UNP has requested the Speaker to have the debate on the no confidence motion against all 16 Ministers on the same day.
MP Rahman said all ministers who voted in favour of the no confidence motion have been plotting against the government and that they should no longer represent the yahapalanaya government.
“They are a headache to the Yahapalana government. They are in the Presidential Secretariat in the morning and they spend the night at Wijerama Mawatha. They are not loyal to the government and therefore they should leave the governement,” he said.
He said the 16 SLFPers include ministers, deputy ministers and state ministers including the Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala.
