Citizens' Mail

Lessons from Melbourne
A couple of months back, I visited Melbourne and I was astonished to see the perfect cleanliness, green beauty and systems of the country. Especially, the law and order of the country are strictly followed by the people. If someone fails to follow the road rules and regulations they would be spot fined.
Every action is under surveillance of camera in public places, transports roads and so on. Be as it may the drivers and the pedestrians patiently wait at the traffic light posts until the lights turn into green. Travelling by public transport in that country was very comfortable and enjoyable. Either in the buses or trains no pushing and pulling the fellow commuters. Further, there are no conductors to issue tickets only self- service by using the machines. Surprisingly, I had not seen people spitting on the roads, a common practice in Sri Lanka.
Most importantly, people do not throw any trash on the streets instead they strictly use the bins which are placed everywhere. The cleanliness of the public toilets, worst in our country, is unbelievable. Top of all, Human beings are valued and respected to the most in a reciprocal way. People are very much cultured.
The significant opportunities given to the children can be observed in every aspect obviously. Moreover, food items are free of adulteration. Above all people can move around the country freely without fear day and night. All in all, Melbourne is a peaceful and lovely city of Australia. The truth is, once Australia was also under colonization. Then, why we, the Sri Lankans, cannot practice such sterling qualities to make a better, healthy and beautiful Sri Lanka.
