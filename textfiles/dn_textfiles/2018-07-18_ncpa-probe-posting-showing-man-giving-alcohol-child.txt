NCPA to probe posting showing man giving alcohol to child

The National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) had launched investigations regarding a video that was posted on social media last Saturday, where a child sitting on the lap of a man was being given something similar to an alcoholic beverage.
Speaking to the Daily News, the Media Officer of the Child Protection Authority Shanika Malalgoda said the NCPA together with the computer emergency
response team (CERT) are in the process of investigating the relevant footage and those responsible for posting it.
“We have already identified the persons involved and those who had uploaded the video. As soon as the post was published, we were alerted, as we have a constant monitoring system that alerts us to such posts concerning children.”
She noted that legal measures would be initiated against these persons once the investigations have been completed.
According to Malalgoda, the NCPA has a special cyber watch and within the next few days the results of the investigations would be made public and those responsible would be charged.
