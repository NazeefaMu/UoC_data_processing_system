Footwear and Leather Fair ends on colourful note

The ninth Exhibition in this series 'Footwear and Leather Fair', organized by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce in collaboration with the Industrial Development Board, Sri Lanka Footwear and Leather Products Manufactures Association, and Export Development Board, concluded at the BMICH on Sunday.
