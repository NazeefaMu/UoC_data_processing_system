Lest we forget

July, for Sri Lanka, has hardly been propitious, with, most associating the month as that portending disaster or calamity. This hoodoo, linked to July, is amply given expression locally by the term Jooly hathai, which goes to demonstrate the ill boding that the month of July has come to be associated with. And not without reason. July was the month in which the country witnessed its two worst conflagrations and carnage in recent memory - the anti-Tamil riots in 1958 and Black July of 1983. The nascent terrorist movement in the North also first emerged in the month of July in 1977 with the killing of Inspector Bastianpillai whose mutilated body was dumped in an empty well in Murunkan. But it was the incidents in July ’83 that surpassed all conflagrations that was witnessed in post Independence Sri Lanka in scope and intensity.
The fateful landmine in Thinnaveli, that killed 13 soldiers, was to change the entire political and ethnic landscape in this country forever, the consequences of which we are carrying to this day. A miniscule minority of the majority community took leave of their senses, momentarily, and went on a mindless orgy of murder and arson while the country's political leadership looked on, and, some said, with tacit approval of the mayhem unleashed on a defenceless community. The entire country was literarily on fire for one whole week, with politicians too egging on the mob in their mad rampage. Sri Lanka was to pay dearly for the mindless acts of a few, with the country ostracized internationally, and the economy, that was taking off after a long period of stagnation, in tatters, with a mass exodus of Tamil professionals such as doctors, engineers, accountants, architects etc, adding to the woes. The blackened image of the country also fatally affected the tourism industry with travel bans to Sri Lanka slapped by many countries.
But what hit the country worst was the fillip this gave the terrorist movement which won mass recruitment into its fold but also turned the LTTE into a conventional army in the way of training and arms supplies from abroad, making the outfit morph into an organisation that was capable of fighting the military on virtually equal terms.
The “pogrom” also gave India a free hand to interfere in the affairs of this country, ostensibly due to the kinship of the Tamils of Sri Lanka with South India but in reality to make JRJ, who was flirting with the USA, to fall in line. In furtherance of this, an Accord was foisted on the country in the name of devolution of power to the North, which also saw the merger of the North with the East and for the first time since the exit of our colonial masters an alien army known as the Indian Peace Keeping Force set foot in the country which in turn added fuel to the smouldering embers of terrorism in the South.
The full scale war that was sparked off by Black July is mercifully over but the legacy and fallout is still haunting the country and with new dimensions added. The country is today swamped with issues and problems that could directly be traced to the three decades old conflict triggered by the barbarism of a few. As a result, the country has gained a dubious honour of coming under international spotlight for all the wrong reasons. Various busybodies are today poking their noses into the affairs of the country and we have the international community represented by bodies such as the UN insisting on mechanisms and guidelines on matters such as human rights, which, though, we have to comply with as a civilized nation, would certainly not have come to pass but for the mindless action of a few.
It is time that the country makes a reappraisal of things and the leaders ensure that no repeat of the unfortunate incidents of over three decades ago revisit us that has set back the country economically and has brought complex problems to our doorstep. Any hint of incitement to communalism should be nipped in the bud and rabble-rousers severely dealt with. We say this because there is today a tendency for politicians to appeal to the baser instincts of the public as a means of taking a shortcut to power. The current constitution making process have given ammunition to the strident voices to whip up nationalist sentiments, paving the way for another conflagration and put the country into the international dog house once more. For such elements the lessons of history does not matter but the goal of savouring power.
Already we see hatemongers, some even in saffron garb, attempting even to whip up religious hatred and sow the seeds of discord with their incendiary comments. It is incumbent also on the Tamil politicians not to provide ammunition to these hostile elements and to be moderate in their conduct and demands. What is needed is a healing of wounds and living in brotherhood.
