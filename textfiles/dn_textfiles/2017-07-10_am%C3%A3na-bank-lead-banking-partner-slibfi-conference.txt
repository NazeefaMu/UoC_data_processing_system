Amãna Bank - lead banking partner for SLIBFI Conference

Amãna Bank has once again partnered with the Sri Lanka Islamic Banking and Finance Industry (SLIBFI) Conference as its lead banking partner.
The Conference is to take place on July 11, 2017 with the participation of many industry leaders, practitioners, advisories, regulators and scholars.
Held for the ninth time, the SLIBFI conference this year will be held under the theme ‘20 years of Islamic Finance in Sri Lanka’ with panel discussions reflecting upon the achievements in the past two decades as well as how the industry is geared to take on the ever changing banking landscape.
Commenting on the partnership, the Bank’s Chief Executive Officer Mohamed Azmeer said, “Amãna Bank is honoured to be the Lead Banking Partner of the SLIBFI conference as the IBF industry celebrates 20 years of existence in Sri Lanka. The roots of Amãna Bank also go way back to the year 1997, the year in which the challenging journey to establish Sri Lanka’s first licensed commercial Bank to operate holistically under the principles of non-interest based banking began.”
Amãna Bank is the country’s first Licensed Commercial Bank to operate in complete harmony with the globally growing non-interest based banking model. With the mission of Enabling Growth and Enriching Lives, the Bank reaches out to its customers through a growing network of 28 branches and 3800+ ATM access points and has introduced a bouquet of customer conveniences such as Internet and Mobile Banking, Debit Card with SMS alerts, Saturday Banking, Extended Banking Hours, 24x7 Cash Deposit Machines and Banking Units exclusively for ladies.
Fitch Ratings, in October 2016, affirmed the Bank’s National Long Term Rating of BB(lka) with a Stable Outlook.
The Bank was recognized as the Best ‘Up-and-Comer’ Islamic Bank of the World by ‘Global Finance Magazine’ at the 18th Annual World’s Best Banks Award Ceremony held in Washington DC, USA.
The Bank was also bestowed the coveted title ‘Islamic Finance Entity of the Year 2016’ at the inaugural Islamic Finance Forum of South Asia Awards Ceremony.
