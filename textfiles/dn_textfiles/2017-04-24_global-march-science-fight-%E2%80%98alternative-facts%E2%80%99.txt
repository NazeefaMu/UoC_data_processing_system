Global march for science to fight ‘alternative facts’

US: Thousands of people joined a global March for Science on Saturday with Washington the epicenter of a movement to fight against what many see as an “assault on facts” by populist politicians.
US President Donald Trump himself passed dozens of protesters on his way to visit wounded soldiers at a military hospital.
“Stop denying the earth is dying,” one sign visible from Trump’s motorcade read.
Despite rain, protesters gathered around the Washington Monument for a festive day of music, speeches and teach-ins by scientists disturbed by the rise of so-called “alternative facts” around crucial issues like climate change following Trump’s election.
“We have no Planet B,” read one of the signs. Many demonstrators sported “Keep Our Science Great” caps as they arrived from around the country on Earth Day to highlight the importance of science to daily lives. Protesters marched to the US Capitol to carry their pro-science message.
“Science is political but it is not partisan. Science serves all of us. Together we can -- dare I say it -- save the world! Let’s march!” declared a television personality, Bill Nye the Science Guy, who currently heads the Planetary Society.
The movement was echoed in hundreds of events across the United States and around the world, from Sydney to Accra.
At a time when the Earth has marked three consecutive years of record-breaking heat, and ice is melting at an unprecedented rate at the poles, risking massive sea level rise in the decades ahead, some marchers said it was more important than ever for scientists to communicate and work toward solutions to curb fossil fuel emissions. In London, hundreds of people marched from the Science Museum to the Houses of Parliament, holding signs with messages like “Science is Sexy” and “Less Invasions, More Equations.”
The London rally was attended by actor Peter Capaldi, who plays TV’s time-travelling hero of science, Dr Who.
In Ghana, organizers used the day for a teach-in at a beachside hotel in Accra about environmental issues of local concern such as the impact of plastic waste on the environment.
“It’s killing our fish, we have flooding in our communities, we have a rise of environmental diseases,” said Cordie Aziz, an American activist involved in plastics recycling.
Vocal protesters in Sydney wearing white lab coats called on politicians to support the scientific community. “We need thinkers not deniers,” read one banner.
Demonstrators turned out across Australia, in Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide and other cities, as well as Wellington and Auckland in New Zealand.
“In this day and age, there’s so much fake news and alternate facts going around that it’s important to remember that science is what has built the society we know today,” Parissa Zand, who was at the Sydney march with her molecular biologist mother, told AFP.
