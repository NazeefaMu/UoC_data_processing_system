Ocean Governance crucial for country’s future: Sagala

Project Management, Youth Affairs and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka, highlighting the topic ‘Ocean Good Governance’, said Sri Lanka was engaging in initiatives with regional players who had economic stakes in the Indian Ocean.
He was addressing the third Indian Ocean Conference in Vietnam, yesterday morning.
“Sri Lanka looks to further integrate with the world by undertaking reforms to facilitate trade, while encouraging productive foreign investments,” the minister said.
“Sri Lanka has a vision of what the country would to be in the world today. It is re-positioning itself to optimise its relationship with its neighbours and other partners in order to leverage its geo-strategic position and become the hub of the India Ocean,” he added.
Highlighting Sri Lanka’s position on the matter, Minister Ratnayaka said, “Sri Lanka’s strategy is to leverage investments to boost its industries such as tourism, expand its manufacturing base, and safeguard its main exports such as garments and tea.”
The Indian Ocean played a critical role in driving global economy, and it would play a more important role in future, he added.
“The Indian Ocean is central to deciding our common global future. The shared nature of the Indian Ocean needs to be recognised and it is in our common interest to care, protect and develop this shared space for mutual benefit,” the minister said.
He said, “Maintaining peace and security in the Indian Ocean is a prerequisite for the development and growth of the region. It is the collective responsibility of the countries in this region and beyond, to ensure that the Indian Ocean is better managed, safe, productive and resilient through ‘Oceanic good governance’.”
The issues around the Indian Ocean were complex and required concerted effort by littoral states to address the issues and take advantage of the opportunities that the ocean presented. At present, there were multiple Indian Ocean organisations and forums; however, in terms of achieving effective regional cooperation, there was still a long way to go, the minister said.
He inquired, “Therefore, what would be the most suitable regional architecture that would focus on key issues and provide necessary perspective of sub-regional dynamics that would drive a coherent and overall policy on ocean governance?”
“We may need to consider a multi-layered approach in terms of division of thematic responsibilities as well as sub-regional interests, within an overarching Indian Ocean framework of shared values and principles,” he said, “There is no perfect fit on what regional architecture works best for such a ocean space. There are issues that can be addressed as a wider Indian Ocean community, and there are issues that can be dealt with more meaningfully at a thematic level or sub-regional level. It is about taking forward all these strands of activity within an architecture based on shared values and principles founded on the United Nations (UN) Convention on the Law of the Sea.”
Minister Ratnayaka said, “In my view, it is high time for us, the littoral states, to be the masters of our own fate.
There should be increased coordination, participation and engagement by littoral states in determining how affairs are run in the Indian Ocean.”
Proper regional cooperation could help achieve the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. A single-minded focus on national strategies and actions had diverted attention from critical regional actions needed to promote energy, food, and water security-related SDGs; strengthen environmental sustainability, address climate change, and prevent natural disasters, he said.
