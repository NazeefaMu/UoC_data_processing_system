Leeds downed by transfer target Bowen

LONDON, Saturday - Jarrod Bowen struck twice to give Hull a 2-0 victory over the team linked with signing him as Championship leaders Leeds United’s seven-match winning run was brought to an end on Saturday.
The 22-year-old -- who the Yorkshire club are reportedly willing to offer £6.5million ($8.2million) to replace homesick Spaniard Samuel Saiz -- struck once in each half to give his side their fifth win in six games.
Leeds were unable to repeat their feat of the past two matches in coming from behind to win 3-2 but remain three points clear of Norwich.
Leeds’ Argentinian coach Marcelo Bielsa blamed the defeat on a lack of accuracy in front of goal but was satisfied enough with the overall performance.
“Until now, the team has given a positive response,” said the 63-year-old former Argentina and Chile national coach.
“We ran enough and we dominated the game. When you don’t dominate a game, you make less effort.
“The performance of the team was not particularly different from the other games we played.”
Norwich had looked on course to go level on points with Bielsa’s side when they took a 3-2 lead over Derby through Finnish international Teemu Pikku’s second of the match nine minutes from time -- but then the floodlights failed at Carrow Road.
Norwich’s cohesiveness also faded when the game restarted 15 minutes later as goals from Florian Jozefzoon and Jack Marriott secured the points for Frank Lampard’s side in a thrilling 4-3 triumph.
Lampard pumped the air in celebration as his side halted a run of three games without a win and consolidated sixth place, four points clear of Birmingham.
“It was a game which had everything and I don’t think I have been involved with one like that before,” said Lampard.
“I think the delay worked in our favour because Norwich had just scored their goal and the momentum was with them.
“It was bad timing for them and good timing for us because it gave us the chance to reorganise things.”
Norwich stay in second spot, two points ahead of third-placed West Bromwich Albion who showed character to draw 1-1 with Sheffield Wednesday.
West Brom looked to be down and out when Jay Rodriguez was sent off in the 63rd minute but Chris Brunt popped up to prod the ball home in the fifth minute of time added on to share the points.
West Brom’s manager Darren Moore said they would probably appeal Rodriguez’ red card -- for stamping on Marco Matias -- as they cannot afford to have such a crucial player miss three matches.
“When he came off he (Rodriguez) said: ‘gaffer, I didn’t touch him’,” said Moore.
“I believe that. It looked a nothing incident. I would like to appeal it as it is a straight red and a three-game ban.”
Aitor Karanka’s hold on the Nottingham Forest manager’s job looks even less secure after they went down 1-0 to Millwall, who moved three points clear of the bottom three.
Ryan Tunnicliffe’s overhead kick settled the game and extended Forest’s run without a win to five matches with the daunting task of facing Leeds on Tuesday to come. - AFP
