CFC earns record income during Avurudu

The Ceylon Fisheries Corporation (CFC) had earned a recorded income during this year's Sinhala and Tamil New Year (Avurudu) season.
Under the guidance of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, the CFC had taken measures to control the rise of fish prices and to reduce the prices of four types of fish during Avurudu.
The information was revealed at a meeting held recently under the patronage of Minister Amaraweera, at the Ministry.
It had been observed in the past New Year seasons, that the price of a kilogram of prawns had remained between Rs. 1,300 and 1,800, while sailfish prices remained between Rs. 1,200 and Rs. 1,450. Hence, the CFC had decided to reduce the prices of certain fish varieties commonly consumed during the festive season.
Furthermore, it had been recorded that a kilogram of mackerel was sold at Rs. 250, while tuna was sold at Rs. 350 per kilogram. At CFC stalls, cut pieces (per kilogram) of tuna, sailfish and prawns had been sold at a price of Rs. 550, Rs. 720 and Rs. 890, respectively.
Minister Amaraweera said that during this New Year festive season, the CFC could increase their income by 70 percent and sales by 68 percent, compared to the previous year.
He said that the CFC could earn an income of Rs. 72,276,871.20 by selling 135,892.29 kg of fish through their sales outlets during the period of April 5 to 18.
During the corresponding period of the previous year, the CFC had earned only Rs. 53,607,787.49 by selling 92,867.36 kg of fish.
