‘Constitutional reforms will provide solutions acceptable to all’

A solution acceptable to all sections of society will be found through the Constitutional reforms that will be introduced by the government, said Foreign Affairs Deputy Minister Manusha Nanayakkara.
He was addressing a meeting held at Galle to mark the introduction of the Grama Shakthi programme on November 15.
Nanayakkara said whenever the government tried to bring in solutions to problems in the past, the Opposition had been obstructing it through demonstrations and other activities. Communalism had been an effective tool in gaining power in the country in the past. But today’s scenario was completely different because the two major parties had formed a consensus government to resolve burning problems. This had given the government a god-sent opportunity to take decisions necessary for the country’s future programmes, he said.
This golden opportunity should be clinched by all because it would not occur again in the future, he said.
