Siddhalepa staff celebrates Vesak Lantern competition

Siddhalepa staff came out in their full strength, with sheer creativity and innovation to display some novel and beautiful lanterns this Vesak.
Lanterns turned out for the inter department annual competition were displayed at the Siddhalepa Hospital premises for the public to enjoy during Vesak.
This year the focus was on using recyclable and degradable waste as a raw material for creating the lanterns.
