Protests banned within Galle Cricket Stadium

Galle Chief Magistrate Harshana Kekunawela issued an injunction order yesterday preventing demonstrations within the Galle International Cricket Stadium from November 6 to 10 when the Sri Lanka – England Test Cricket match will be played. The Magistrate issued the order in consideration of submissions made to him by Galle Police stating that a group was planning to hold a protest against Cricket authorities’ decision to remove that group from organizational duties of the Test match.
Police cited Helambage Wasantha Kumara of Ambalangoda and Mahesh Sanjeewa as the perpetrators of the protest and told courts that they had received information about their planned demonstration during the Sri Lanka – England Test match. They had been transferred to Matara division as a result of their proven irregularities in performing their official duties, police added.
