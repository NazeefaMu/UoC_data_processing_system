‘Hat-Trick’  champs

The Interact Club of Zahira College and the Rotaract Club of Colombo Fort organised the sixth installment of Hat-Trick. The flagship project of the two clubs sets an example among other Interact and Rotaract clubs through their strong bond. What makes Hat Trick different from other cricket tournaments is its unique layout and the manner in which it brings together the young generation of the country. .
An event launch for Hat trick 18’ was held at the Zahira College, Swimming Pool Complex recently. The event launch saw young cricketers setting the draw and the organizing committee presented the rules and regulations of the draw. It was important in letting the young cricketers know about the limitations and boundaries to make sure Hat Trick 18’ would run smoothly without hassle.
Hat-trick’18 was held at the Sri Lanka Moors Sports Club from 8 am. The organizers pulled together a masterpiece by ensuring that 60 matches were conducted during the day and received positive feedback from many of the participants. Around 32 teams too part in Hat-trick ‘18.
The tournament eventually saw the champions of Interact Premier League (The Interact Club of DS Senanayake) and Rotaract Premier League (The Rotaract Club of Moratuwa Alumni) battling it out for the Hat Trick Cup. The Rotaract Club of Moratuwa Alumni was crowned as the champions of Hat-trcik ‘18 after they beat the Interact Club of D S Senanayake. The ladies of The Rotaract Club of Moratuwa Alumni were also crowed Hat Trick Women’s Champions as they took home both Crowns and cash prizes. It was a night of celebration.
The tournament also offered Bowl and Plate championships to other participating clubs and thereby created a very competitive atmosphere for all participating Interact and Rotaract Clubs. Individual awards like Best Batsman, Best Bowler, Best Fielder and Man of the Tournament were also handed out.
The cricket tournament ended with a Hopper Night. All the spectators and participants embraced a fantastic night of fellowship after the awards ceremony that was lit up with fireworks. On the lighter side the Hopper station clearly had a tough time catering to scores of Rotaractors and Interactors with more than 500 hoppers being consumed that night.
The project chairpersons Rtr. Nazmi Mahamood and Int. Mohamed Rishad thanked their team for the effort. Chief Guest Rtn. Priyan Hettipathirana, President of Colombo Fort Rotary Club distributed prizes to the winning teams.
