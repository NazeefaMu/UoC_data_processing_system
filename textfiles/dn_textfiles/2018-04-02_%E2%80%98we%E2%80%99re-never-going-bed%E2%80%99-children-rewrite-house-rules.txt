‘We’re never going to bed’: children rewrite the house rules

‘The house has the airless discombobulation of a student house in the 90s, the day after a big night out on ecstasy’: Decca Aitkenhead
Three hours in, I feel weightless, almost giddy. I’m lying on the sofa with my boys, eating chocolate, watching telly, and it is no exaggeration to say that I am having the time of my life. For the first time in eight and a half years, I am not in charge. This exotic sensation of relaxation is completely unfamiliar – and yet stirs a distant memory of who I used to be.
The kids-in-charge experiment began at 1pm, and I can’t believe how well it’s going. In truth I’d been dreading it, braced for carnage, but so far it has been nothing but fun. At 1.01pm the boys had raced to the bakery and spent £10 on cakes, before charging on up the road for lunch in McDonald’s. I’m very much enjoying the absence of washing-up, and curious to see what they will eat next.
Jake proposes a trip to the corner shop for provisions. I float along the pavement beside him, laughing at his jokes; his mood is unrecognisably effervescent, fizzing with wit, and I tell him he’s on cracking form. He halts and turns to me, his expression suddenly earnest.
“But don’t you see? This is the real me. Your rules make me go,” and he shrinks, hunching his shoulders and drawing his wrists together as if cuffed. “But our rules have unleashed the real me,” and he skips off into the shop.
Jake and Joe’s rules
* Decca isn’t allowed to say no
* No baths
* Hourly food fight
* Unlimited screens
* No bedtime
* Decca has to play Laser Tag when we want
* Unlimited sweets and crisps and chocolates and fizzy drinks

* Email Donald Trump every 10 hours to insult him
* We are allowed to get games on Decca’s phone
* Allowed to swear
* Unlimited water fights
* Worst table manners
* No vegetables
Allowed to jump on Decca’s bed, to play on a Wii and to pee on the toilet seat
I stare after him, stunned. What if he is right? What have I been thinking all these years, grimly policing bedtimes and broccoli and pee on the toilet seat? By other parents’ standards I’d always considered myself relatively permissive; I’ve neither the time nor energy to be a helicopter/tiger mum. But now, as the tension of everyday parenting melts away, I’m beginning to see the grinding joylessness of family life under my rules.
In the shop, I watch Jake’s brain struggle to adjust to the heady concept of limitlessness. He dances up the aisles, dazed by possibilities, turning out of habit to seek permission as he reaches for a sack of crisps. Seeing my smiley shrug, he grabs a chocolate bar next – then, like a prisoner acclimatising to freedom, two great handfuls. The only point at which I intervene is when he asks the shopkeeper for “two cans of Stella Art… Art… Artoize”.
We come home with £52-worth of fizzy drinks, sweets, crisps and cookies, which the boys lay out across the kitchen table like a gaudy tablecloth spun from confectionery. Our fruit bowls and jars of lentils and seeds on the shelves now look as if they have been Photoshopped in from somebody else’s house. The kitchen resembles a reality TV set housing two ludicrously incompatible families.
While the sugar-rush kicks in, an almighty pillow fight breaks out, and it begins to feel a bit Lord Of The Flies. Jake sets up an old Wii donated by a family friend. Ordinarily, the boys are allowed 15 minutes a day of TV after school, movies at weekends, and no other screens, unless a) at other people’s houses, b) on long-haul flights, or c) on holidays where a luggage allowance can’t accommodate a fortnight’s worth of Lego/books/lightsabers, etc. My iPad will occasionally be deployed in an emergency situation, but that’s the extent of the boys’ access to technology.
Having grown up in the 70s without a television, I consider these rules quite generous – but then, the appeal of electronic devices has always been lost on me. Jake and Joe are hoping to use this opportunity to convert me to their charms – and so, at the age of 47, I play my first video game. It is called Bomberman Land.
They’re so thrilled to see their mum operate a console, I almost want to enjoy it. Instead, I’m nonplussed, and very quickly bored.
They get me to play Lego Batman next, but it makes me feel seasick. Puzzled by my failure to share their enthusiasm, they invite their eight-year-old friend John round. When Joe shrieks at him, “We’re never going to bed!” it strikes me that I might need some company, too.
I rustle up some friends, Chinese delivery and wine, and we have the loveliest evening, joyously uninterrupted by the tedium of bedtime rituals. No teeth will be brushed, no toys tidied away.
The kids don’t even need to be fed. They work their way through their provisions like locusts, until the house is littered in a confetti of wrappers.
