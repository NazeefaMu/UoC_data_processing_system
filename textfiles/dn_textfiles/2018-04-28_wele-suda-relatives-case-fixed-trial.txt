Wele Suda, relatives case fixed for trial

A money laundering case filed against three accused including controversial drug dealer Gampola Vidanage Samantha Kumara alias Wele Suda and his wife was yesterday fixed for trial by the Colombo High Court.
Meanwhile, the Attorney General raised objections regarding a request made by the defence that ancestral jewellery with sentimental family value belonging to the wife of Wele Suda be released.
High Court Judge Sampath Wijeratne fixed the case for trial to be heard on July 18.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against three accused for laundering money to the tune of Rs. 190 million in 2006 under 57 charges under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.
At a previous occasion, the Colombo High Court had rejected preliminary objections raised on behalf of the three accused over this indictment filed against them by the Attorney General under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.
Convicted drug dealer Wele Suda who was sentenced to death by the Colombo High Court over another case was produced before court.
