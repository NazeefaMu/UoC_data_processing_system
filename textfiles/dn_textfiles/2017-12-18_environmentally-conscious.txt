Coca-Cola and World Trade Centre “Give Back Life” to 23,000 PET bottles in recycled Christmas décor
Environmentally conscious!

In keeping with its much-loved tradition to make the Christmas season a special one the world over, Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd. and the World Trade Centre (WTC) dove into the festivities, but this year with the impactful message of being environmentally conscious and reducing waste. In a unique display of Christmas cheer, colourful, vibrant, upcycled Christmas trees and wreaths made from the recycling of Coca-Cola’s PET bottles adorn the World Trade Centre, Colombo. Coca-Cola provided 23,000 PET bottles towards the handmade Christmas décor by MAIC, commissioned by the WTC. Visitors to the busy offices of WTC will be treated to this wondrous celebration of Christmas with an environmentally conscious core.
This collaboration between WTC, MAIC and Coca-Cola is yet another initiative through Coca-Cola’s ‘Give Back Life’ (it’s campaign in PET collection, recycling and waste management). A creative reimagining of empty PET bottles, which otherwise would in day-to-day life end up in garbage dump sites. PET bottles are 100% recyclable (i.e. identified with the number 1 inside the recycling logo) and tend to be used for packaging of beverages, toiletries and cooking items in Sri Lanka. Coca-Cola’s ‘Give Back Life’ drives awareness of individual responsibility of waste disposal and recycling, and champions the importance of community-led, sustainable initiatives in post-consumed PET recovery, recycling and waste management practices through its principle of Extended Producer Responsibility.
Coca-Cola has successfully led large-scale PET clean-up drives through community-led volunteerism during the Kataragama Festival and the Marine Environmental Protection Authority (MEPA) National Coastal and Marine Resources Conservation Week.
