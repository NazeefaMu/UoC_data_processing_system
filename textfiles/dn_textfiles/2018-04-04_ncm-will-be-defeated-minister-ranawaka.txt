NCM will be defeated -Minister Ranawaka

Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said yesterday that they would vote against the No Confidence Motion (NCM) brought against the Premier.
The Minister said so after a press conference on the ‘Suryabhishekaya’ mega spring festival and trade fair, organised to celebrate the upcoming Sinhala and Tamil New Year.
“The main allegation brought against the Premier in the NCM was the Central Bank bond issue. However, the culprits were caught and necessary actions were taken against the accused. So there is no reason to support the NCM,” said the Minister. Shedding light on the meeting between the President and a group of UNP Parliamentarians on Monday, the Minister said the President had stated that he is capable of running the country with any government with his powers as Executive President.
However, the Minister was critical of the government for covering up the frauds of the previous regime.
“The government did not take necessary action against the former President and covered it all up,” the Minister alleged. “The recent elections showed us that the government did not rise to the people’s expectations and more was needed.
It is clear that we need a radical change to the policies along with a new youth leadership with skills and talents.
The leaders should be reminded constantly that they represent the expectations of the people,” said the Minister.
