Cop transporting cattle nabbed

The Mulliyaveli Police apprehended a police officer who was transporting six cattle in a cab from Mullaitivu to Trincomalee.
The detection was made by a group of Mulliyaveli Police officers on Tuesday night when they had been on a routine inspection.
They had stopped the cab and having spotted the police, two persons who had also been in the cab escaped, while the police officer who was driving the cab had been nabbed by the police.
Investigations revealed that the cattle were being transported without a valid licence and the suspect police officer was attached to the Puthukudiiruppu Police.
The Mulliyaveli Police were scheduled to produce the suspect and the cattle in court yesterday.
Further investigations into this incident are being conducted by the Mulliyaveli Police.
