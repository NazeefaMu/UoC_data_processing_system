Udayanga wll be brought down within a month: MR

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said he would get down Udayanga Weeratunga within a month.
He was addressing a media briefing at Kataragama during his recent visit to the sacred city.
The former President said Weeratunga’s children are studying abroad, and he would return to Sri Lanka after removing them from schools. He said the government stated that Udayanga wuld be brought to Sri Lanka via Interpol but they failed.
Rajapaksa said his opponents thinking that he would contest the 2020 Presidential Election are levelling allegations against him.
He said the underworld activities have already tarnished the image of the government. He said his regime made the underworld inactive.
