NPC to undertake provincial railway gate maintenance

Northern Province Opposition Leader K. Thavarasa proposed on Thursday that the Council must undertake railway gate maintenance through the local authorities.
NPC member M.K.Sivailingam seconded the proposal. He said many accidents take place at unsafe railway gates.
He said the Railway Department officials disregard the issue of the unsafe railway gates. Thavarasa and Sivajilingam said the NPC Chief Minister conducted a meeting with the Government Agents to resolve the problem.
Thavarsa said gatekeepers would be appointed through the local authorities with the permission of the Central Government. The council accepted the proposal.
