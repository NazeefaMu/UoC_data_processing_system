SLFP MPs in Opposition set to rejoin government: Amunugama

Several Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) parliamentarians who sat in the Opposition recently are once again discussing to rejoin the unity government, Minister Sarath Amunugama said.
Speaking to journalists in Kandy, the Minister said that many of the SLFP members who left the government are dejected as they had not got what they wanted from the Joint Opposition.
He said many of the JO members, instead of welcoming the 16 members, have refused to accept them into their fold.
The Minister predicted that at least two or three SLFP members who left the government may re-join in the near future.
Earlier SLFP ministers who voted in favour of the No-confidence Motion brought by the Joint Opposition against the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe resigned from their ministerial portfolios of the national government.
The SLFP Cabinet, State and the Deputy Ministers who voted for the No-confidence Motion and the Deputy Speaker resigned from their posts.
