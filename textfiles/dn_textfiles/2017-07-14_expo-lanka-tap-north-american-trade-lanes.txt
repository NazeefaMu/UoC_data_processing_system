Expo Lanka to tap North American trade lanes

Expo Lanka Holdings (EFL) is looking at deepening the penetration in both the North American and Intra-Asia trade lanes, with an equal emphasis on growing air and ocean freight volumes.
“At the same time, EFL would look to make inroads into untapped territory, mainly the transpacific trade lane where ocean freight traffic has been on the rise in recent years, said Group CEO Hanif Yusoof.
“In the logistics sector, the main priority would be to position EFL as the first global logistics brand originating from the sub-continent. To drive this, we expect to pursue a two-pronged approach; grow the freight business and expand the logistics operations globall.”
“Growing ocean freight volumes amidst the current overcapacity scenario however calls for some caution and requires EFL to hone its procurement programme and further refine pricing strategies to secure a competitive advantage”
At the same time, sharpening EFL’s profile as an end-to-end logistics service provider calls for renewed efforts to expand the warehouse and distribution management model globally.
