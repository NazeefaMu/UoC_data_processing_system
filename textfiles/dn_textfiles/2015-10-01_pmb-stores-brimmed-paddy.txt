PMB stores brimmed with paddy

The Paddy Marketing Board (PMB) has stocked around 66,000 metric tons of paddy in the Anuradhapura district. It includes 32,000 mt bought in 2015 Yala and 34,460 mt of paddy purchased in the 2014/2015 Maha season.
Farmer organisations said if the PMB continued to buy paddy during the Yala season, at least another 10,000 mt of paddy could have been purchased. It is learnt that some paddy stocks purchased last year were decaying in stores.
Meanwhile, Rural Economic Development Minister P. Harrison and Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake held talks on the disposal of paddy stocks in the stores for milling. A Cabinet paper will be submitted in this connection.
It has been planned to cultivate paddy in 260,000 hectares in the Anuradhapura district during the 2015/2016 Maha season. The PMB aims to enhance storage facilities up to 50,000 mt in the district.
