ComBank in World’s  Top 1,000 Banks again

The Commercial Bank of Ceylon has been ranked among the Top 1000 Banks of the World in 2018, and remains the only Bank in the country to be on this prestigious ranking for eight consecutive years.
The Top 1000 Banks of the World are ranked by the UK’s ‘The Banker’ magazine on the basis of Tier I capital, assets, capital assets ratio, pre-tax profits, return on capital, return on assets, BIS (Basel) Capital ratio, NPL to total loans, loans to assets ratio, risk weighted assets (RWA) to total assets (TA) ratio and cost income ratio.
Managing Director,CEO Jegan Durairatnam said, “A ranking in the Top 1,000 could be approximated to being among the top 6% of the banks of the world, which is extremely respectable. Holding one’s position within that elite group for eight years means that we are maintaining growth rates that are keeping pacewith or are exceeding those of other leading international banks, despite the challenges we face.”
The top four positions in the 2018 global ranking are held by Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Construction Bank,Bank of China and Agricultural Bank of China.
