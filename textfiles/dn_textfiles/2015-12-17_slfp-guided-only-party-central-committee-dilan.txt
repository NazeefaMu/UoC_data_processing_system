SLFP guided only by party Central Committee - Dilan

Highways State Minister Dilan Perera stressed that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) is taken forward based only on the decisions taken at the SLFP Central Committee and not guided by personal views of anyone.
Even though there are alternative views in the SLFP the party is driven based on the decisions taken at the Central Committee unlike during the regimes of former Presidents Mahinda Rajapaksa and Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga.
He was addressing the SLFP weekly press briefing at the SLFPheadquarters yesterday.
Speaking on the Budget 2016 the Minister said that Budget 2016 was subjected to several key amendments during the Committee Stage. The budget is debated at the Committee Stage aiming to make the necessary amendments even though that opportunity was not utilized thus far, until this year. Accordingly several proposals of the budget have been re-considered including the proposals relating to vehicle permits, vehicle emission testing tax and many more.
"For the first time in the political history of the country Budget 2016 was amended at the Committee Stage. Therefore, the budget will be passed in Parliament with a clear majority at the Third Reading on the 19 th ", he said.
Speaking on the forthcoming local government election, Minister Perera said the SLFP will contest the next local government election under the United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA)banner as a broad alliance comprised of all parties of the UPFA. But the SLFP will never go with extremist parties. President Maithripala Sirisena will lead the UPFA election campaign. He added that the people of the country expect several changes in certain sectors. Among these expectations are the abolishment of the Executive Presidency and implementing the new electoral system. Besides, national policies should be introduced for key sectors such as education, heath,agriculture etc.
