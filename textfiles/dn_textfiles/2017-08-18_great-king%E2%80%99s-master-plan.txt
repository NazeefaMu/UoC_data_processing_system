The Great King’s Master Plan

Juliet Coombe discovers how exciting and innovative the second Kingdom Polonnaruwa was eight hundred years ago, when The Great King Parakramabahu rode his elephant through the jungle inspiring thousands of men to clear it to create the most sophisticated interconnecting tank system in the world.
The Great King Parakramabahu understanding the importance of trade joined originally existing water tanks built in the Anuradhapura period to small canals he dug out, which in turn linked to the sub arteries of the Mahaweli River. The Queens and ministers would have followed behind the Great King in sedan chairs known as ‘Dolawa,’ which required four men to carry them while the thousands of workers that built the tanks went on foot or by bullock cart. How the King fed this number of people in desert like conditions is just one of the many questions I have for my encyclopaedic national guide Priyantha Dambadeniya, whose exclusive engineering and historical lake experience can be booked through EKHO Lake House Polonnaruwa or you can email him in advance of your tour on [email protected] to talk to him about this and many other amazing tours he does.
I learn many things as I have a go at walking across Gomathi Ela canal using a handmade bridge of logs strapped together one after the other with only coir rope keeping them attached, I realise total balance is required or I will end up face down in the water. I am watched over by water loving trees and a cheeky Malabar Pied Hornbill, just waiting for me to noise dive into the canal that is linked to the five tanks that are part of a fascinating new engineering and architectural tour.
Spiritual healers
The raw experience of balancing on tree trunks, gives me a better understanding of just how clever this civilisation was in harnessing every aspect of nature in creative and new ways that are still used today by the highly inventive people of the area. Guide Dambadeniya who walks across it like a trapeze artist on a high rope starts his half-day tour in front of what many believe is the only statue of The Great King Parakramabahu in the library quarters of the ancient city. I learn many things about Sri Lankas ancient Kings, who converted the people from paganism into Buddhism building huge stupors to do it in the shape of rocks, as up until the third century BC the people of this mystical island only worshipped rock, big trees, the sun and the moon. This way carving Buddha’s out of rock like the one you can see at Gal Vihara made it easy for the people to transfer their belief system from paganism into worshipping the precepts of the Buddha.
Dambadeniya my guide, also known as The Master due his decades of studies in history and wildlife explains the Buddhist monks were responsible for teaching Great King Parakramabahu, whose technological ideas sprung from years of learned teachings in the temple. He also loved studying first hand the jungle plants for their healing powers with native doctors.
The King learnt the importance of healing mantras which are supernatural powers that allow one to fix ill health and the monks also showed him gurukam a healing of the mind, which today the west call psychotherapy. To do this you need to be deeply religious and this explains my spiritual guides power to show the depth of this remarkable civilisation that brought the place to life. He explained sitting on a rock that spiritual healers hundreds of years ago could read your life story from your face or palm of your hands and within minutes of doing so tell you your future, even your health issues if no preventive care was taken.
The King himself a deeply spiritual man who used the legacy of the first kingdom Anuradhapura who built the first tank in the area to build on this by building four huge more tanks and canals to interconnect to the river starting from Nuwara Eliya, through Kandy and into sub arteries, joining them into hand cut canals that worked like a cascade system, which finally interconnected together with the tanks to form an incredible inland ocean known today as Parakrama Samudra. This was achieved by clearing over 2,500 hectares of land (6,000 acres) to achieve the vast tank system for trade. He was the first man to understand the importance of water management and is said to have declared to his people “Not a single drop of the water sent into the sea must be wasted’ and one can see from his power shower to pool and then irrigation of the gardens to the fields how the same water was used many times. This philosophy is still applied today as the Parakrama Samudra tanks which are used for everything from drinking water, to washing, irrigation of the paddy fields, growing more than eight hundred species of plants, including important medicinal leaves like Katu Pita, which cleans the blood and cures cancer.
These manmade water tanks created by thousands of people over 18 years are still used for transportation of goods, people, lake fishing for food and now tourism to explain village life. The water ways even provides natural mining for semi precious gems like rose garnets, which can be picked out of the Ambo Ganga river with your own hands as part of the half day tour.
An ancient citadel
This exciting archaeological look at the historic engineering system of the Great King takes you past four of the five tanks, and along the way I learn about medicinal plants, and how even the Kings soap for washing were made from leaves and thus none toxic to the environment. While learning about how to use medicinal plants, I am also told fascinating stories about suicide plants.
People have no idea how for example the Peru Ornamental plant arrived in the dry zone and one can only assume it was from the big trading ships that came from India, China, Persia or Arabia. The seeds of this beautiful flower are as deadly hard as a nut and to break it open you need a rock. These deadly seeds inside are used as suicide capsules when mixed with sugar they become like jelly so easier to eat and are still to this day used by upset village lovers to kill themselves. The English know this poisonous shrub as Yellow Oleander and the people give the flowers as offerings to the Buddha.
I learn sitting on the river bank how Chinese trading ships brought gold, silver, fabulous fabrics to the area to trade them in return for spices and gem stones. Indian traders came for the elephant ivory something the area was rich in during those times. Even the great explorer Marco Polo came to the isle of plenty to buy stones to make jewellery fitting for the elite. The EKHO Lake House Polonnaruwa hotel is perfectly situated just above one of the jetties where the small merchant boats landed to trade, and this stunning spot can be fully explored after high tea, which is served, on the rocks to flute music from a boat, on the bund, where the columns were once made for the summer palaces on the lake.
This fabulous boutique hotel in Polonnaruwa EKHO Lake House Polonnaruwa is now with the incredible re-furbishment not only the areas best location to stay for four or five days with its world class restaurant menu and delightful staff, but also a chance to finally learn more about the areas history.
So where better to be than nestled among the ruins of an ancient citadel in the dry zone conceived by the Great King, and later developed by the British Empire so the world could come and admire his brilliant work? So whether it is early morning or late afternoon this fascinating tour with Dambadeniya will help you understand the incredible engineering achievements and have the benefits of being pampered afterwards by a uniquely trained butler team, who pride themselves on making every stay in the ancient citadel of Polonnaruwa an indulgent one.
