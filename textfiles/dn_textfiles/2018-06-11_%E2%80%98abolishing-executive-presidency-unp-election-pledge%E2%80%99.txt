‘Abolishing of executive presidency, a UNP election pledge’

The United National Party (UNP) is of the view that the executive presidency should be abolished, said Social Empowerment Minister P Harrison.
He said that this was also an election pledge given during the last Presidential Election. The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) had moved a motion suggesting the abolishing of the executive presidency. The UNP was also of the view that the executive presidency should be changed. Minister Harrison said that Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena of the Group of 16 has said that the motion for the 20th Amendment to the Constitution moved by the JVP to abolish the executive presidency should be withdrawn.
“But the Group of 16 is not a part of any group in the House of Parliament,” he said. “If what they said is correct, Mahinda Rajapaksa would have won the last Presidential Election. But that did not happen.”
The Minister said that he had not accepted a penny from Aloysius. He added that during the 100 day programme, there were only 47 UNPers in the government.
It was questionable as to who the others of the 166 were, who took money from Aloysius as mentioned by Dayasiri Jayasekara.
“Arjun Aloysius was associating with Mahinda Rajapaksa and his children while they were in power. Even the night before the day of the election, Aloysius was with them,” Minister Harrison said.
