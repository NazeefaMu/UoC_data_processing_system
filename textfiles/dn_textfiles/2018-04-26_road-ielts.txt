Road to IELTS

British Council and Clarity English have collaborated to develop an online preparation and practice resource for the IELTS. This online tool was launched for the first time in Sri Lanka on April 14 exclusively through the British Council IELTS Registration centre network. The Road to IELTS programme is designed to enable test takers to perform to the best of their capabilities and can be accessed from anywhere using desktops, tablets and soon mobile phones as well.
Road to IELTS Institutional version is a comprehensive and up-to-date practice resource aimed at tackling the challenges faced by IELTS candidates. It comprises of four key resources for each skill area, beginning with an eBook which introduces each paper and explains task types. Further resources include advice and tutorial videos by experts, a practice zone, and test practice, where candidates simulate the test experience with mock tests.
IELTS is the International English Language Testing System, the world’s most popular English language proficiency test for higher education and global migration with over 3 million tests taken in the last year. Over 10,000 organisations trust and accept IELTS as a secure, valid and reliable indicator of true to life ability to communicate in English for education, immigration and professional accreditation. IELTS is jointly owned by British Council, IDP: IELTS Australia and Cambridge English Language Assessment.
The British Council emphasises and understands the importance of IELTS for students aiming to study abroad. As explained by registered IELTS examiner and Managing Director of Clarity English, Andrew Stokes, “Typically, overseas students accept an offer of a university place about six months before the academic year begins. However, most will not take their IELTS test until three months later, and inevitably a certain percentage fails to achieve the band score required for the course.” Failing at the IELTS can drastically affect one’s future.
Clarity English is a developer of tech-based learning materials for English and the recipient of the English-Speaking Union Innovation Award and the HKICT Award for Technical Excellence (Best Product) for Road to IELTS. Established in 1994, its relationship with British Council spans over 20 projects. British Council and ClarityEnglish also co-publish other IELTS support resources in addition to Road to IELTS.
With Road to IELTS, effective test preparation and teacher support extends beyond the classroom. The program is devised to mark students’ work and provide feedback on individual performance as well. According to Dr Victoria Clark of the British Council, “Depending on motivation and talent, a student can raise their level of English by half to one IELTS band score in three months if they put in enough work.”
Since its inception, Road to IELTS has concluded more than 4 million sessions and is utilized by more than 1,000 schools globally. A survey of 130,000 users of Road to IELTS determined that those who use it the most improve by as much as 52%.
“Our IELTS Registration centre network, spans across the country. Many of them offer IELTS preparation support to test candidates and we are keen to support the partner network with quality tools for IELTS preparation. We understand that preparation is key to get desired results at the test”, said Simon Creasey, Country Exams Manager British Council at the launch.
The resource comprises of more than 300 interactive exercises, 36 individual practice tests, and 24 advice videos. Road to IELTS has several features, including a countdown clock, an IELTS score calculator, a timer for exam practice, and downloadable study sheets. The My Progress function enables students to monitor performance, analyse their use of time, compare performance with other online users, and even predict band scores in the Reading and Listening tests using an interactive widget.
“The Road to IELTS institutional version will enable IELTS teachers to prepare test candidates better. The tool will complement the class room and bring in further professionalism to the IELTS teachers who work with us through our partner network”, said Dileepa Manawadu, Head of Business Development UK qualifications at the launch.
IELTS test is administered by the British Council in multiple locations in Colombo, Kandy, Jaffna, Galle, Matara, Negombo, Kurunegala and Batticaloa. IELTS candidates who takes the test at a British Council test centre receives a wide range of free preparation support from library access, seminars and practice books in addition to a 30-hour preparation course.
