Ken gets a makeover... finally!

The ‘all-American-man’, Barbie’s blue-eyes chiselled boyfriend Ken is finally set to get a makeover. From cornrows to man bun, the new Ken will have it all!
After being overshadowed by Barbie for decades, now Ken is finally getting some attention with this new makeover. The new crew of latest Barbie and Ken Fashionistas feature even more skin tones, eye colors, hairstyles, and fashions and now Ken comes in three body types: broad, slim and original.
The New Crew extension introduces a whopping 40 Barbie and Ken dolls, each more dynamic than what it used to be.
There will be 15 new dolls added to his name with six new molded hairstyles, including cornrows and an on-trend man bun and seven skin tones. Barbie announced the New Crew in a tweet, with the hashtag #TheDollEvolves. The Fashionistas collection was first launched in 2016 with three new body types as well as varied skin types, etc.
In February, Barbie Fashionistas earned the coveted Toy of the Year award from the Toy Industry Association in February. Ken hasn’t changed much since he was first introduced. 56 years ago as Barbie’s blue-eyed, chiselled boyfriend.
Since Ken’s release, the company has launched more than 100 different looks for the doll.
Mattel is trying to fight falling sales of its iconic doll line at a time when many kids would rather play with an iPad.
Barbie sales were down 13 percent in the first three months of the year compared with the same period a year ago.
A live-action Barbie movie is in the works for next year, with hopes that the big-screen flick will spur doll sales as well.
Ken was in need of a makeover, said Jim Silver, the editor-in-chief of toy review website TTPM. He said kids who play with the revamped Barbie dolls don't want an outdated Ken.
"He's part of the storyline and he has to fit in with the picture," Silver said, "or you would lose sales."
The man doll, it seems will alos sport mordernised fashion ranging from casual business attires to athletic wear.
The El Segundo, California-based company also announced new Barbie looks Tuesday, including one with a nearly shaved head and another with an Afro.
Mattel has been tinkering with other lines to be more inclusive, such as adding its first boy doll for the American Girl brand. Mirror
