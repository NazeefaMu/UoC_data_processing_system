Speaker urges improving quality, productivity in work places

The quality and productivity of organizations is important to achieve the expected economic target in our country. This also encourages more foreign investors and tourists to the country, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said.
Speaking at the awards ceremony of the Sri Lanka Association for the Advancement of Quality and Productivity (SLAAQP), he said. “If our country needs to enter the competitive world market we have to develop our productivity and also the quality of exports.”
He said, it is therefore, important to recognize and encourage employees of many different organizations to improve quality and standards of their products and services. “If our employees make an effort to improve the quality and productivity we will be able to increase our exports.”
Speaker Jayasuriya highlighted that Sri Lanka was a highly developed country several decades ago when compared to countries such as Japan and Korea, but unfortunately now we are far behind.
“Since our production is not up to the required standard we have to still import goods from Korea, Japan and India,” he said.
The Speaker was also concerned about valuable time and man-power wastage due to various protests and work stoppages by certain groups. “This affects the economy badly.”
The speaker also drew attention towards the 176 working days in our country out of 365 days and said too many holidays also contribute negatively to the economy.
He also expressed concern over the negative attitude of some politicians who always seek the power rather than performing their duties to the betterment of the country. He said with 35-years of experience in the private sector, he knows the value of productivity.
“Therefore, I urge people and organizations to take a step forward in improving quality and productivity in their working places and contribute positively to the growth of the economy.
President, SLAAQP, D. B. Gamalath said SLAAQP was founded in 1996 and since then the association has contributed immensely to the improving of quality and productivity of local organizations.
He said the SLAAQP is a non-profit organization and consists of professionals who contribute to the betterment of organizations.
