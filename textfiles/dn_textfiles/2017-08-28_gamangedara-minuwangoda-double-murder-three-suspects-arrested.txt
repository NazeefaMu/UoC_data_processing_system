Gamangedara, Minuwangoda double murder : Three suspects arrested

Three suspects including a father and son were arrested yesterday in connection with Saturday’s double homicide in Gamangedara, Minuwangoda.
On Saturday, a 48-year-old father and his 20-year-old son were hacked to death during a clash between two groups of people..
The killing was a result of a long standing dispute between the family of the deceased and a neighbouring family, police said. The dispute had recently flared up during a kite flying competition where the 20-year-old youth had clashed with the boy who was arrested.
The two youths and their fathers clashed again later. The deceased, a dry fish seller, reportedly was travelling with his son for business when they met his neighbour. The Police had taken into custody a knife and several weapons used in the clash.
