UPR Info ‘satisfied’ with government commitment

UPR Info, an NGO dedicated to promoting the Universal Periodic Review, yesterday said that there is progress on the part of Sri Lankan government in implementation of recommendations at the Universal Periodic Review held in Geneva in November 2017.
UPR Info Country Coodinator Herman Kumara told a press conference that the Sri Lankan government had expressed its willingness to accept 177 recommendations out of 230 that were made on Sri Lanka at the Universal Periodic Review in Geneva.
However, Kumara stated that there are some issues with resettlement and land in the Northern Province where progress is slow.
He said the discussions held between civil society organisations and the Sri Lankan government at the United Nations, for collective work on implementation of the Universal Periodic Review were successful.
