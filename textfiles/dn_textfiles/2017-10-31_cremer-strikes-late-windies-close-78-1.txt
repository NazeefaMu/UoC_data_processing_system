Cremer strikes late as Windies close on 78-1

Bulawayo: Zimbabwe legspinner Graeme Cremer struck late on day two to end a turgid opening stand and keep the West Indies in check in the second Test at Queens Sports Club on Monday.
A grinding partnership of 76 in 46 overs between Kraigg Brathwaite and Kieran Powell had given the West Indies a solid base in their reply to Zimbabwe’s 326 all out, before Cremer removed Brathwaite for 32 to send the visitors to stumps on 78 for one. Zimbabwe’s total was built on the back of Hamilton Masakadza’s 147 and Sikandar Raza’s 80, which saw the hosts bowled out in the hour after lunch.
Brathwaite and Powell ended a run of 18 innings without a fifty partnership as they took the patient approach to batting on a slow, turning surface.
The West Indies lead the two-match series 1-0. AFP
