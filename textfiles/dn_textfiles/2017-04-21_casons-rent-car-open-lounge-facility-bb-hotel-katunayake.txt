Casons Rent-A-Car to open lounge facility  at B&B Hotel Katunayake

Casons Rent-A-Car, one of the oldest rent a car operators in Sri Lanka will introduce special lounge facility for tourists patronising the Colombo airport from February 2018. This will be at their new second hotel, Casons B&B Katunayake which will open in close proximity to the Colombo airport.
Casons also opened a travel counter at the Colombo International Airport's Arrival Terminal recently.Casons Rent-Car Chairman, Zakir Ahamed said that with the opening of their travel counter at the Colombo airport, they have identified several grey areas and this is the reason they decided to offer a lounge facility outside the airport to passengers for less that US 10 dollars per stay including coffee, tea and snacks.
"Flight schedules will be displayed at the hotel and all guests will be dropped and picked up by our drivers.
He said that the proposed Casons Bed and Breakfast too will offer 20 rooms and for the first time they will charge guests on an hourly basis. “This will encourage guests to relax if they have longer check-in times.”
He also said that for the first time in Sri Lanka they will introduce a facility where a passenger taking flight could park their vehicles at this hotel and fly to any destination and take the vehicle upon return. We will offer them a free pick up and a drop and also maintain their car while they are overseas.”
Ahamed said that one of the unique features of this concept is that the passenger will be able track the movements of the vehicle via a special App.
Casons Airport's Travel counter will operate over 500 new vehicles with a chauffeur for tours to cater to the tourists visiting Sri Lanka.
Services provided by the counter: include, airport transfers, drop hires, car rental with or without driver, VIP Transfers, Excursion, special packages, hotel accommodation and even motorbicycle rentals and 4x4 rentals. (SS)
