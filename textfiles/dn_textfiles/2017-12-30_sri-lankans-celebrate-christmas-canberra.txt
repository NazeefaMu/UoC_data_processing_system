Sri Lankans celebrate Christmas in Canberra

Christmas was celebrated at the Sri Lankan High Commission in Canberra, Australia with the participation of the Sri Lankan community on December 16.
Rev. Father Kevin Harris delivered blessings and a message highlighting the true meaning of Christmas. He referred to the modest surroundings in which Baby Jesus was born as a reminder to all of humanity.
A multi-ethnic multi-religious group of colourfully dressed Choristers representing the Australia-Sri Lanka Association and the Canberra Tamil Christian Fellowship sang carols in unison in Sinhala, Tamil and English, joined by the High Commission staff.
The audience rose to their feet in singing together the final carol for the evening, the famous Silent Night with lyrics of the first two verses in Sinhala and Tamil and the final two in English.
The High Commissioner said it was a perfect way to bring to a close a most eventful year in our diplomatic relations with Australia and in community events at the Mission. The rendering of carols in all three languages, he said, was in itself a blessing and the way forward to peace and harmony.
The High Commissioner in his remarks referred to these moments as being very special, and thanked Rev. Father Harris, the choristers, the musicians and the gathering for their contribution in making the celebration a true Christmas blessing.
