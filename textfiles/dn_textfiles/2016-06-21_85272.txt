Gayle and Jayawardene star for Somerset

LoNdon, Sunday: Chris Gayle and Mahela Jayawardene were both in the runs as Somerset beat Hampshire by six wickets in the South Division of English county cricket’s Twenty20 Blast at Taunton on Sunday.
West Indies batsman Gayle struck three typically huge sixes and four fours on his way to 52 before the left-hander was bowled by Will Smith.
Jayawardene, who retired from Sri Lanka duty after last year’s World Cup, then saw Somerset to their modest target of 134 with an unbeaten 45 off 32 balls, including a six and six fours.
Somerset’s Jamie Overton and Max Waller had earlier taken four wickets each as Hampshire were dismissed for a modest 133.
Overton, a pace bowler, took the wickets of Hampshire opener Michael Carberry (17), skipper James Vince (10), West Indies all-rounder Darren Sammy (nought) and Gareth Berg (four) at a cost of just 22 runs, while leg-spinner Waller took four for 33.
Elsewhere New Zealand wicket-keeper Luke Ronchi’s 53 helped Warwickshire beat Lancashire by 18 runs under the Duckworth/Lewis method at Edgbaston.
Yorkshire claimed their first Blast win of the season, by the narrowest margin as they defeated Derbyshire by one run in a rain-marred match at Headingley.
Chasing Derbyshire’s total of 153 for nine, Yorkshire, faced only nine overs but reached 67 for three, which was the precise score they needed to secure a win under the Duckworth/Lewis method.
Former England opener Adam Lyth hit two sixes and three fours in a 16-ball 30 and New Zealand’s Kane Williamson made 21 off 20 deliveries faced.
