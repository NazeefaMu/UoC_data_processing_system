Cafe Sociale - space for creations

Café Sociale marks the first of its kind in the modern metropolis and boasts a curated space and an eclectic menu. Located at 252A, Galle Road, Colombo 04 (opposite St. Paul’s Church), the café is open from 10am – 10pm daily.
Managing Director Shiva Balachandran said, “Café Sociale is not just your typical café where you would walk in for a quick bite or a coffee to-go. Instead what we have created is a space for people to come and be innovators.”
The menu at Café Sociale is a creative genius using plays on famous movie titles for everything you get on it. The short but interesting menu pays tribute to the likes of “Vanilla Sky”, “Top (Gun) Bun”, “Beverly Hills (Cop) Cod and Italian Job among many others. Reasonably priced at rates affordable enough for students and start-up businesses, the menu includes many favourites from around the world and have been selected by Consultant Chef Thushara Gunawardhana, who has over 14 years of experience in the hospitality industry in Australia and Sri Lanka. The kitchen at Café Sociale is also fitted in with world-class equipment like the Rational Self Cooking Center while the finest ingredients from across the world are used to prepare the unique dishes. Maintaining the best hygiene and food safety standards as per the guidelines set by the consultant chef, Café Social’s creative and dedicated culinary and management teams have created a space and menu that is truly a cut above the rest.

Café Sociale as its name suggests is a place for people to socialize. In keeping with the theme the café has also introduced innovative concepts such as the “Co-ffice” which is a space for eight hot desking spaces available to customers on a first-come-first-served basis. At a nominal fee this “seat” also offers eight hours of free Wi-Fi and Air-Conditioning.
The café also houses a 12-seater boardroom aptly named ““Co-laborate” which can be rented out for an out-of-office brain-storming session or a meeting of any kind. For the more casual gatherings, Café Sociale also has an outside space where pets are welcome. This backyard can also be rented for private functions.
