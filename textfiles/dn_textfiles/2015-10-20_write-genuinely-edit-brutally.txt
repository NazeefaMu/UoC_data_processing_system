Write genuinely, edit brutally!

“You are my ocean-poem.
The one I have written
but cannot show the world.
When I go to a land
where there is no ocean,
I will say, like an
island-woman,
“I miss the sea”.
You will know what it is
I am saying.”
– an untitled poem from vivimariev.blogspot.com
Dr. Vivimarie Vanderpoorten is a Sri Lankan poet whose compilation of works Nothing Prepares You won her the Gratiaen Prize 2007, and consequently launched her into local literary renown. She followed it up with Stitch Your Eyelids Shut in 2010, which took us further into her outlook on Sri Lankan politics and our two-decade civil war. Her writing was described by Gratiaen panelist Dr Sinharaja Tammita Delgoda as “gentle, reflective minimalism, which touches the soul… [her] poetry is like a shadow passing your face.”
We meet her now five years later, between her English lectures at the Open University of Sri Lanka, for a chat about her career and her thoughts about Sri Lanka’s changing literary scene.
Q: Your first book was more emotive and personal, while your second got more political, what will your next be like?
A: I’m working on my third book, but I’ve been tinkering with it for five years now and I’m not yet satisfied enough to see it published. I think it will be a kind of mixture of my first two books.
Q: As a teacher of English, your classes are a sort of training course for aspiring writers. What are some of the key lessons you give them?
A: Well actually we teach more academic writing than creative writing, though we’re considering introducing a creative writing module soon. I try to teach them about how politics intersects with writing, and how to appreciate different cultures, so there’s the lesson of social cohesion.
Q: Literature students at university are potentially the next generation’s authors. How do the Sri Lankan youth respond to literature?
A: Students actually hardly read today. They read the curriculum textbooks but reading for pleasure - has become a rare thing. It’s because everything has become so utilitarian. Even education is now just a marketable commodity – but learning is much more than a set of skills to get the best job. There needs to be a discourse around this.
Q: Your work has been translated into Sinhala and Tamil. Do you feel like language is a kind of barrier in Sri Lanka’s literary scene?
A: Yes it can be but there are more and more translations coming out now, and comparative literature (comparing writings of different languages) is becoming a thing here. It helps to have more bilingual writers, like Hashana Rambukwella and Liyanage Amarakeerthi.
More people are writing now and all the awards, poetry readings and Open Mics are helping this happen. There needs to be dialogue between Sinhala, Tamil and English writing.
Q: Do you have a target audience for your work?
A: Not really. I think I write for myself. There is a wide range of people – from students to old people – who have expressed appreciation for my work.
Q: Is there a reason why your second book of poetry dived deeper intolocal politics? Do you feel Sri Lankan writers have a responsibility to address larger political issues and reconciliation?
A: I guess I wrote more about it as a result of just living through the height of war in Sri Lanka and dealing with the aftermath. I think any writer should address larger issues, since we are products of this society and we reflect it too.
Q: Who are you reading these days?
A: I like Yasmine Gooneratne’s poetry, and work by the current Poet Laureate of Britain, Carol Ann Duffy. I’m reading Faiz Ahmad Faiz’s Urdu poetry, some Palestinian poetry, and I also enjoy the Sinhala works of Amarakeerthi and the young poet RuwanBandujeewa.
Q: The Galle Literary Festival has been criticized by some as being too expensive or targeting only a certain class of Colombo people, while the recent Annasi&Kadalagotu Literary Festival was much more localized and open to the public. What do you think the future of Sri Lanka’s literary scene will be like?
A: I think there’s a great future. It’s the beginning of a very interesting phase. There are different media of literature now, and a digital culture, which makes everything more available.
And the boundaries between media are blurring – for example there’s Colombo’s ImaadMajeed who writes poetry and raps it as well.
Q: Many say that ‘writer’ and ‘poet’ are not wise career options in an increasingly industrial world. What would you say to that?
A: It’s true, you need to keep your day job. But at least prose or fiction writers are definitely more popular than poets – people are more likely to pick up your book if it’s a story than a work of poetry.
Q: Some argue there is an obvious lack of literary criticism in Sri Lanka and a lack of English publishing houses and therefore a lack of literary development – do you agree? What can we do to improve this?
A: Yes I completely agree. There’s a trend in Sri Lanka to either overly praise the writer, or completely denounce them – there needs to be a degree of professionalism in review writing and criticism that’s constructive.
Maybe we can make this happen by creating a separate magazine for just reviews.
We need to change our culture - become more open to criticism, and not take it so personally.
There are countless Sinhala publishing houses but it’s true, there are few English ones, plus they often have a discouraging mantra “poetry doesn’t sell”.
Q: Any advice you would give to young people who want to be published authors some day?
A: Write genuinely. Edit your work brutally. Rewrite.
And I know people who write poetry but who just don’t read poetry – you need to read the works of other poets.
