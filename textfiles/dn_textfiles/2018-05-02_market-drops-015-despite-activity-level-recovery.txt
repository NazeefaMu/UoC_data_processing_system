Point of view
Sri Lankan Equity markets ended the week on a negative note, reversing the positive momentum that dominated in the previous two weeks when the broad share ASPI surpassed the 6500 mark for the first time since Mid-March.
Although market activity returned to normal levels this week as investors returned to markets post the Traditional New Year holidays, the benchmark Index ended the week at 6531.06 to record an ~10 point loss W-o-W.
Despite the overall market ending on a negative note, investors remained interested in blue chip stocks over the week, helping JKH gain ~2.8% W-o-W while Dialog gained ~2.2% W-o-W.
JKH consequently accounted for ~23.4% of this week’s total turnover. Activity levels also improved this week, helping turnover hit a 3 week high of Rs.3.1Bn (cf. Rs1.3Bn last week), and pushing the daily average turnover up by ~141% W-o-W (Rs.0.62Bn cf. Rs.26Bn).
Market activity however was dominated by retail investors as Local institutional and HNI investors opted to remain on the sidelines yet again.
Local Institutional and HNI participation accounted for just ~32% (of total market turnover) during the week cf. the average of ~47% year to date. Foreign investors meanwhile, showed interest in Sri Lankan equities, helping the Bourse record a net foreign inflow of Rs.0.3Bn cf. a net foreign inflow of Rs.0.1Bn of last week.
However, higher exchange rate volatility & rupee depreciation (~LKR depreciated 2.6% year to date) in the last few weeks has remained a concern for foreign investors, and the YTD net foreign outflow amounted to Rs.0.9Bn (including LOLC’s transaction for Rs.12.8Bn).
Markets in the week ahead are likely to move in line with developments on the political and economic front.
CB forecasts inflation to stabilize at 4.0%
National inflation levels in Mar’18 fell to a 2-year low of 2.8% Y-o-Y, down from the 4.2% Y-o-Y recorded in Feb’18.
The decline in headline inflation was driven largely by the general reduction in Food inflation (from 3.7% Y-o-Y in Feb’18 to 2.6% Y-o-Y in Mar’18) while Nonfood inflation increased marginally (from 2.8% Y-o-Y in Feb’18 to 2.9% Y-o-Y in Mar’18).
Urban inflation levels meanwhile, continued to drop in 2018 as CCPI dipped to 4.2% Y-o-Y in Mar’2018 from 7.1% Y-oY in Dec’2017, while core inflation also reduced to 3.4% Y-o-Y in Mar’18 from 4.3% Y-o-Y in Dec’17.
Lower national and urban inflation levels in 2018 (cf. Annual average 7.7% in 2017) allowed the CBSL to reduce the interest rates by 25bps at its 2nd monetary policy review for the year.
Despite the expected fuel price revision in the year, the CBSL projected urban inflation in 2018 stabilizing at 4.0%, and ~5.0% in the medium term (2019-2022). Meanwhile, the LKR experienced higher volatility this month due to greater importer dollar demand, with the LKR depreciating ~1.1% in this month so-far cf. ~0.5% in Mar’18 and ~0.7% in Feb’18.
The CBSL was quick to re-assure markets however, with the CBSL Governor stating that the recent FX market volatility is unwarranted as the country’s foreign reserve position remains positive, with FX reserves currently touching a record USD 10Bn as the government has just closed bids on USD 1Bn loan while the USD 0.6Bn final tranche from the Hambantota port lease is also expected (1).
So far this year, the LKR has depreciated ~2.6% against the USD, compared to a total depreciation of 2.3% during 2017.
