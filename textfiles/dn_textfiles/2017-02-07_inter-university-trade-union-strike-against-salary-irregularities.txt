Inter University Trade Union strike against salary irregularities

 
The university academic workers have launched a strike today (7) in protest of salary irregularities.
Inter University Trade Union Congress Chairman H. M. Vijithasena said that no action has been taken to reimburse monthly deficits and to raise allowances as pledged.
The Inter University Trade Union warned to begin intense protests from February 15 if a favourable response is not made to rectify the issue.
