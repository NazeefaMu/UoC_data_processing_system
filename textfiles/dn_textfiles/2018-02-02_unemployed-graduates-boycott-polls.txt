Unemployed graduates to boycott polls

Unempployed graduates in Ampara District are planning to boycott the local government polls on February 10, said President of Unemployment Graduates of Ampara District.
He handed over a petition to President Maithripala Sirisena in Addalachenai. He said that unemployed graduates were disappointed about promises of jobs by the provincial council of the Eastern Province.
“We hope that President Sirisena will look into the matter of unemployed graduates of Ampara District and provide a solution. We spent 156 days urging the government to recruit all the unemployed graduates into the government sector. Politicians visited us giving promises, but finally nothing happened as we expected,” he said.
