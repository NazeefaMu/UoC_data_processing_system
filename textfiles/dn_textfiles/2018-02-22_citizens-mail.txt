Citizens' Mail

Pride of place for investment
The huge manpower available in rural and urban areas should be utilised for national development. Most of the government contracts should be given to youth groups. Company formation among youth should be promoted by the government as a means of giving the youth an opportunity to participate in the construction field by pooling their experience resources gain legal recognition and acquire appropriate managerial and technical experience, to face the challenge of infrastructural development in the country.
The active support of the country and the assistance of the relevant institution should come together to establish these youth construction companies which can be called “village construction companies - VCC”.
The government expects to disperse Rs. 60,000 million through state and private banks, to would be, entrepreneurs and another Rs. 5,000 million has been set aside by the Treasury to reimburse the interest subsidy to the banks.
With the objective to create one million new jobs to unemployed youth, the government experts the SME sector to be the backbone of the economy. This “Enterprise Sri Lanka” Programme one of the main proposals made in the recent budget to create entrepreneurs would be launched in March.
The concept of the white collar, jobs, decent salaries and social dignity are some of the factors which are pressuring the youth mind. This approach should have a consideration in the new setup.
The national level planners need a completely new pipeline to reach this youth for their own progress. The correct guidance and motivation with financial assistance and managerial training should be channeled to these primary V.C.C. Companies at the very start.
The organisation structure would come out with a workforce of unskilled, skilled supervisory, technical, managerial etc. in implementing the work with dignity and honour.
