Minister to the badge of office
It is very strange that a veteran parliamentarian, Vasudeva Nanayakkara, has raised a question in parliament whether Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka, Minister for Regional Development, could wear his military uniform when attending parliament. Surely he should have known that there is a dress code for parliamentarians. Here, it would be interesting to know Arvindh Kumar, Badulla MP, was not allowed to enter the House as he was wearing a dark orange colour shirt.
The Sergeant-at-Arms, Anil Samerasekera had said, dark coloured shirts are not allowed and they should wear either the national dress or lounge and women parliamentarians, Sarees and long sleeve blouses. Sleeveless not allowed.
In 2009, TNA MP for Batticaloa, Thangeswary Kathiraman, it was reported, was ordered to leave the House as she was wearing a Shalwar-Kameez. A. R. Anjan Umma of the JVP was allowed to come in Abaya and Hijab after obtaining prior permission and so are the Muslim Members to come in their religiously prescribed dress. It was also reported that Srimani Athulathmudali was not allowed to enter as she was wearing a skirt and blouse.
I remember a very interesting incident when we had to attend parliament during Committee Stage of the Budget, when our Ministry votes were taken up. Officials had to occupy the Official Box, and permission was granted only to those who either wore the national dress or lounge – coat and tie. It so happened that our Accountant walked in wearing only a shirt and tie, without a coat. That was the first time he was attending parliament.
He was politely told by the Arachchi that he cannot be allowed entry as he was not properly dressed with a coat. Soon, I had to come to his rescue. Seeing an officer, a friend, from another Ministry leaving, after his business was over, I asked him for his coat, explaining the predicament we were in and made our Accountant put it on. What a sight it was. An oversized coat, touching almost his knee. However, the problem was solved, as the Arachchi allowed him in.
