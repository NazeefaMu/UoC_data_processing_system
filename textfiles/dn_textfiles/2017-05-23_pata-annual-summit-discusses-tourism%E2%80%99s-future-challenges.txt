PATA Annual Summit  discusses tourism’s  future challenges

The Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA) 2017 Annual Summit under the theme ‘Disruption, Innovation, Transformation: The future of tourism’ concluded at Jetwing Hotel, Negombo.
The event discussed many angles in tourism-related matters, opening an excellent opportunity to meet high profile speakers representing the travel and tourism industry.
It was pointed out that the increase in average income and the fall in levels of absolute poverty are seen in the growing middle class.
The middle class population is expected to increase further, up to 4.9 billion, by 2030. These characteristics too will have a considerable impact on the tourism sector.
From these groups, millennials seem to be the most highlighted, with a reputation for being entitled, distracted, and overconfident.
The millennials’ arrival in the workforce is a challenge, but also an opportunity. Known for their technological aptitude and global perspective, millennials bring a unique perspective to the world.
For their managers however, there can be a learning curve when it comes to building working relationships and managing millennials in the workplace. The panelists discussed how to make the most of these unique generation’s best qualities.
Sarah Matthews, Head of Destination Marketing APAC, Trip Advisor, Hong Kong SAR said that the age of transformation will prompt travel agents, hoteliers and key stakeholders in tourism in Sri Lanka and the world over to think differently and be innovative. SS
