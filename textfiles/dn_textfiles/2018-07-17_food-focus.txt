Food focus


There has been much controversy about the Sri Lanka Army engaging in farming activities in the North, especially in Jaffna. However, despite the outcry of the Tamil politicians about the army engaging in farming activities, the Tamil youth, especially those rehabilitated ex-rebel cadres who are given employment at these farms feel that it has given them an opportunity to earn a decent living and live with dignity in society. The benefits they enjoy does not merely mean their salaries, they are also entitled to all the medical and welfare facilities enjoyed by the rest of the army and even their families are provided with free medical assistance, which according to them, is a great blessing.
There are also allegations that the army-run farms are posing a threat to the local farmers and that they have to compete with the military-run farms. However, the Jaffna Security Force Headquarters Commander Maj. Gen. Dharshana Hettiarachchi, vehemently denied these allegations and added that the produce from these farms are not sent to the open market, but instead they are solely for the consumption of the military establishments and the military personnel.
Earlier this year, fifty unemployed youths in the Jaffna peninsula, including rehabilitated former LTTE combatants, were recruited by the Sri Lanka Army for non-military duties in a gesture of goodwill, understanding and reconciliation between civilians and members of the Security Forces.

The new initiative was launched by Major General Darshana Hettiarachchi, Commander, Security Forces-Jaffna (SF-J) in close coordination with the Bureau of the Commissioner General of Rehabilitation and other state officials in the peninsula with the blessings of the Commander of the Army who pioneered the project in the peninsula when he was the Jaffna Commander.
Rehabilitated ex-cadres
These recruits are entitled to a monthly salary of Rs. 40,000 in addition to many other privileges. They are provided with meals, transport, medicine and pension rights in the Army on retirement. Their family members including parents have access to Army medical facilities depending on their marital status.
These new recruits were mainly recruited for the coconut cultivation project in the Army farm in the Palaly Army Cantonment.
These recruits are required to work a regular 8.5-hour work shift and have the privilege of travelling from their homes daily rather than being confined to living within the facility. This also gives them the opportunity to spend time with their families and also take care of their children.
The Jaffna Commander, however, requests the young men and women to work with commitment as Sri Lankan nationals of one family while taking care of their own future.
The Daily News visited the Army-run farm close to the Palali runway in Jaffna, where around 150 rehabilitated ex-cadres are being provided employment.
In the Jaffna Security Force Headquarters held area there are around 3,376 ex-LTTE cadres and of them, 3,097 have undergone the rehabilitation programme, as opposed to only around 279 have not. Of them, around 1,775 of them are available for employment in addition to the 189 non-rehabilitated personnel.
Among these ex-combatants, there has not been any major incident reported while these people who have undergone many hardships during the war, have no desire to return to such violence and are very keen in social integration.
These ex-combatants, who were actively engaged during the war, have found it very hard to be accepted into society once the war ended. As much as they were hailed and feared during the rule of the LTTE, once the war ended these very combatants were shunned by the general public. As a result of it, they were not given employment by society as they were perceived to be violent. This situation left many of these ex-combatants unemployed further aggravating their trauma and frustration, in addition to the trauma and hardships they had to undergo during the conflict. This also left many of them with long-term health issues as well.
Among the ongoing projects is the coconut plantation in collaboration with the Coconut Development Board, Palmyra plantation in collaboration with the Palmyra Development Board, Reforestation, in collaboration with the Forrest Department etc.
The Jaffna Commander said that most of the army personnel remain in the North for only a specific period, but he said the work that the military does is an investment for the future of the people in the region. “They are the ones who will reap the benefits of all the projects that we do,” he said.
However, during a meeting held recently with the United Nations Resident Coordinator for Sri Lanka Terence D. Jones, the Leader of the Opposition and the Tamil National Alliance R. Sampanthan said he was not happy with the army being engaged in farming activities in the North. “We don’t want the Military to run farms on our lands which they are doing now; we want them to be out of these commercial activities which hinder the livelihoods of our people.”
Financial assistance
In addition, TNA spokesman and Jaffna District Parliamentarian Sumanthiran pointed out that decisions of releasing lands should not be left alone to the armed forces but the government must decide and implement.
But, the ex-combatants who are employed on the Palaly farm speaking to the Daily News did not share the same sentiments as the TNA representatives. Instead, they were appreciative of the fact that the Army had given them back their dignity by providing them with the opportunity to be productive citizens of the country and a steady source of income for their families.
Speaking to the Daily News Rasiah Lochana, who had been employed by the Army for the past five years said she was a teacher previously and had served in the LTTE during the war and after the conflict ended, she had not received the acceptance of her people. In a family of four, she is now married and is the mother of two children. Lochana noted that initially, she and her family had reservations about joining the army and her parents were scared. “However, after I joined, I realised that the army personnel are not bad at all and they, in fact, accepted us and treat us better than our own people.”
However, admitting that working on the farm in the hot sun is rather tiring, but said the remuneration she received for it, more than compensated for her efforts. “After the war, I obtained a loan and constructed a house for my family. My older daughter attends Montessori and my younger daughter is just six months. My husband was also employed by the Army previously. In fact, I earn more than my daughter’s school principal does by being employed by the Army,” she joked.
Lochana, however, lamented that rape has increased in the North and she was worried about the future of her daughters.
Sudhakaran Navaneethamalai, another employee engaged in farming activities on the Army farm in Palali said, “I have also been in the army for the past five years. They have treated me well and I am happy. My family is also accepting of my job. I have four children and the oldest son is 14. My husband does not provide for us and I run my family with what I earn from this job. When I am at work my sister looks after my children and since I get to go home every evening, it is easier for me to take care of them. I am originally from Kilinochchi and as an active member of the LTTE, I know how much we suffered as we were the ones who had to go to war. Both my parents were killed during the war and all I want is to ensure that my children never have to undergo the same hardships as I did.”
The army says that their intention is to help these people manage their daily lives and these farms and gradually, they would step back from these civilian activities and hand them over to the people of the North to carry on these activities.
Kirindika Jeganathan who had joined the army just three months ago said she was still adjusting to the work. At 21 years, she was initially employed elsewhere but had later decided to join the army as she could earn better and the army provides better facilities. She is unmarried and even her family was initially afraid to send her to the army. However, having seen the progress of those already in the army and hearing their stories, she too had eventually decided to join. Now, she says she feels safer with the army than with civilian organisations. “Earlier, we were scared to death of the army after the stories we had heard. However, now that I am with them, I realise that all that we were told are not true. I feel very safe here and even the Sinhala soldiers and superiors are very kind to us and we don’t face any discrimination or harassment. We work together on the same farm as brothers and sisters, share our meals and work happily. Now I see that they are no different to any of us, but we were initially scared because of all the wrong impressions that we had about them,” she added.
Free and safe society
Nidharshan a 24-year-old youth had joined the army just two months ago. “I worked in a lathe workshop earlier. My friends who were in the army told me of the many benefits they receive and I too decided to join. When I first came, I was sceptical, but now that I am here with the army, I have a totally different opinion of them. I have lost all that suspicion and I am comfortable working with the Sinhalese soldiers and I see no difference among us. Now when we go out, I always tell the people that army treats us well.
There is over 20,000 youth without jobs and I hope the army can provide more employment opportunities so that these youth too can find proper income and rebuild their lives. Being unemployed only makes them vulnerable to engage in unlawful activities. Hence I personally would encourage anyone among my people to join the army without any fear of all the negative things we have heard about them are all fabricated lies. There is no issue working with the army and it is a safe and secure place to work in. We never ever want a war again and all I want is to educate my sisters and see a free and safe society once again in the North,” he said.
Rahul too has served in the army for the past five years. “Initially it was hard to adjust, but now I have got used to the work and it gives me a good income to support my wife and children. Most importantly, it has given me confidence and dignity in society. However, there are some who try to ridicule us that we are with the Sinhala forces, but I just avoid them because I know that there is no difference and we too need to trust them as much as they trust us. It is the army that has given us the opportunity and I am grateful for it.”
Karan, (30) is another employee of the army who has been serving for the past five years. “My wife too is employed with the army and we earn very well and we are in a good position to assist our families. The hot weather makes it a bit hard for us, working on the farm, but we have to get used to it as we can’t do anything about the weather. The main thing is that we have been given dignity and self-worth and we can live in the society with our heads held high. All these people who criticise us for joining the army did not come forward to help us. Now that they see that we are living well, they are coming behind us asking us to help them get employment within the army too.”
There are about 120 Tamils working within the army farm and for them, although they do have to battle with the hot Jaffna weather, it makes it worthwhile considering the benefits they receive. For these females, they need to serve for a period of just 15 years in order to be entitled to a pension. This, they say, is a great blessing for them. Despite what is being said by the Tamil politicians, for these Tamil civilians recruited by the army, life for them has changed dramatically and so has their perception of the army and the Sinhalese people. There is trust among the Tamils and the army and the Sinhalese which is no doubt the most vital component in the reconciliation process.
