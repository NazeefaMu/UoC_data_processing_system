SLC appoints Disciplinary Committee

 
Sri Lanka Cricket is disappointed to note the negative and misleading comments made by former Chairman of the Selection Committee – Kapila Wijegunawardene, in the wake of the appointment of the new Selection Committee headed by Aravinda de Silva.
Wijegunawardene’s statements are inaccurate, misleading, and defamatory, and furthermore are of the nature to cause grievous injury to the moral of the Sri Lanka Cricket team, currently intent on bringing home the ICC World Twenty 20.
In view of the above, Sri Lanka Cricket has appointed a three member independent panel, headed by Palitha Kumarasinghe PC to review the said statements and comments and make recommendations to Sri Lanka Cricket on the appropriate disciplinary action to be taken if any.
Sri Lanka Cricket wishes to reiterate its confidence in the vision and strategy of the new Selection Committee, under Aravinda de Silva, and is most enthusiastic to note the imminent positive developments that will take Sri Lanka Cricket to the next level and beyond.
