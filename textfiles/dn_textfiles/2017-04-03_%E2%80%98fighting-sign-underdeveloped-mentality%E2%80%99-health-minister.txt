‘Fighting a sign of underdeveloped mentality’: Health Minister

 
Fighting was a sign of an underdeveloped mentality, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Minister Dr. Senaratne said this undeveloped mentality has lead to several problems in the country.
‘They fight for their race, religion and cast because of their mentality.
They try to push the country forward.
 It is like adding fuel to a burning fire,’ the Minister said.
He was addressing the gathering during School Dentists' Association General Assembly held in Colombo recently.
Minister Dr. Senaratne pointed out that we get our race, religion, cast etc. with birth and nothing more in them than that. ‘Fighting for them is a mental problem, which needs to be addressed,’ he said.
‘Some are fighting against privatization. All of this because of their mentality.’ ‘Dentistry has a high recognition in New Zealand.
It is a must for disease prevention.
The issues faced by Sri Lankan dentists should be solved and arrangement will be made to solve the issues after discussing with them,’ he added.
