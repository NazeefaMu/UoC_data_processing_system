Land-encroaching on the rise in Matale

Reservation lands attached to minor irrigation schemes in the Matale district had been encroached by a group of individuals, causing damages to the rural tank networks recently.
Suspects had constructed a number of illegal buildings in such lands, while other regions had been utilised for cultivation activities.
In this connection, farmer organisations said that in the current state, sediment levels in tanks and anicuts were rising, while reducing their water capacities.
The said development in turn, had disrupted the progress of irrigation activities.
The Agrarian Services Department had neglected the matter, farmer organisations in the area said, while urging the the government to take immediate action to quell the issue.
