New envoy in Sri Lanka to  increase trade ties with Lithuania

Sri Lanka's trade with Lithuania is at a very low ebb and it will now take a huge leap forward with the appointment of an Ambassador to Sri Lanka.
Consul General for Lithuania and Supreme Global Holdings Chairman R.M.Manivannan said that the fact that an Ambassador was appointed to Sri Lanka is a sign that both countries are keen to promote bilateral trade.
He said that plans are now underway to set up a Sri Lanka Lithuanian Business Council and also several trade promotion delegations too will take place from this year.
He said that Sri Lankan companies too can take advantage of some of the advanced technology from Lithuania. “We will aggressively promote trade, culture, tourism, education, and other goals as may be formulated.”
Ambassador LaimonasTalat-Kelpsa said that he had met up with top government officials to discuss the strengthening of political, economic, diplomatic, social and cultural ties between Lithuania and Sri Lanka.

He said that the trade between the two countries was last year was 6 million Euros with 5 Million in favour of Sri Lanka. “Main exports are tea, coffee, seafood and chemical products while imports from Lithuania have been machinery and wood items.”
I am sure this trade figure can increase by twofold soon as in the case of India where both trade and education soared in recent years.”
He said that Lithuania has laser technology that is the best in the world and Sri Lankan industries must try to acquire this technology from us. “In addition we will open out more opportunities for Sri Lankan apparel worlds and also for high skilled labor for which new laws have being introduced.”Sri Lanka and Lithuania established diplomatic relations in 1996. Ambassador LaimonasTalat-Kelpsa achievements are Lithuania's invitation to NATO occasion a memorable mark (2003), Lithuanian National Defence System commemorative accession to NATO Medal (2004) and Georgia's Order of Honour (2012).
