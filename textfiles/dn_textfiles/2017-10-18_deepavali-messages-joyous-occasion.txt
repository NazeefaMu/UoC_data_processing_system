Deepavali Messages: Joyous occasion

"I am privileged and pleased to extend my greetings to the Hindu devotees on this joyous occasion of Deepavali, one of the most gracious celebrations of Hindu devotees worldwide," Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Minister John Amaratunga in his Deepavali Message said.
"According to sacred Hindi texts distressed people who underwent unbearable torment at the hands of demonic narasuras pleaded with Lord Visnu to rid them of the evil elements which Lord Vishnu obliged by defeating the demons at war. Liberated people in thanksgiving celebrate Deepavali with utmost reverence while performing religious rites and engaging in fasting.
The word 'Deepavali' is made of two words; deep (lamp) and avali (row), which means a line or a row of lamps. Hindus around the world have been celebrating Deepavali from time immemorial on a religious note and with sublime adoration receiving divine blessing which illuminate their lives," the Minister stated.
