Arrested for cheating pensioners

A man who had cheated a number of pensioners posing as a government officer attached to the Pensions Department, has been arrested by the Wariyapola Police.
The suspect had obtained large sums of money from several retired pensioners in the Kurunegala district, promising that they would be given their due arrears in pension payments very early, under his patronage.
The suspect had collected the details of the concerned pensioners and their family members in advance from the respective divisional secretariats and thereafter, had visited the homes of the concerned pensioners to obtain money.
It is believed that the suspect has cheated the pensioners in millions of rupees during the past few years.
Wariyapola Police OIC IP Nilantha Bandara is now investigating the matter, as about 18 pensioners who were misguided by this suspect have complained to the police.
