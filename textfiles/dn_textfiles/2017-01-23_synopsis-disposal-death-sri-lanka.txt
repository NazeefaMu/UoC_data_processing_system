A synopsis of disposal of death in Sri Lanka

A body could be disposed lawfully or unlawfully. The unlawful disposal of a body or bodies is also termed surreptitious disposal which is often resorted to when a need arises to conceal a secret homicide.
Measures such as throwing in to a waterway, secret burial, cremation, dismemberment, abandoning in a jungle, fabricating an accident or a suicide are employed in this venture.
Surreptitious disposal could also occur during periods of civil unrest where multiple bodies could be disposed of in tire-pyres or buried in mass-graves following extra-judicial execution.
The aim of this article is to provide the reader with a brief overview of the steps taken in the legal/lawful disposal of bodies.
A body could be legally disposed by burial, cremation, entombment or donation to a scientific institution such as a medical school. Yet, this is the final step of the disposal. There are a series of events that should follow prior to this final stage.
People most often die in hospitals now. When a person dies in a ward, the intern medical officer is entitled to certify that the person is dead. In medicine, we speak of three different types of death ie: molecular death, somatic death and brain death. Brain death could also be further divided into several sub-types.
In day to day clinical practice in the normal ward settings, we satisfy ourselves by resorting in to the diagnosis of somatic death when pronouncing the death of a patient though the diagnosis of brain death could be mandatory in certain complicated situations such as in switching off of life-support systems, organ harvesting/cadaveric donations etc.
In the diagnosis of somatic death, the house officer may carry out certain simple clinical tests/examinations and conclude the absence of audible heart sounds, absence of palpable central pulse, absence of spontaneous breathing and spontaneous beating of the heart, absence of pupillary light reflex in the eyes, areflexia, hypotonia and absence of motor response to adequate painful stimuli.
Once the death is confirmed, the house officer should document the same on the bead head ticket (BHT) with the date, time, his name and designation and then place his signature underneath. The time documented on the BHT is considered as the time of death.
The body should then be kept in the ward for around two hours before sending to the morgue. If there is slightest suspicion as to whether the person is actually dead, the house officer could re-examine the body at the end of two hours prior to sending the body to the mortuary or ask a senior colleague for assistance and opinion.
After sending the body to the mortuary, the house officer should take a very important medico-legal decision ie: whether this death needs an inquest or not.
Let us later discuss the indications for an inquest and their legal provisions in the Criminal Procedure Code. If the house officer decides that this death does not need an inquest, then he is entitled to fill the Declaration of Death Form and hand it over to the legal claimant of the body.
The legal claimant of the body can then register the death with the Births and Deaths Registrar of the area who will issue either the Death Certificate or a temporary cover note.
This document issued by the registrar is essential to take the body out of the hospital mortuary, to hand over the body to the funeral directors (or to a medical faculty), for making arrangements at the cemetery and for obituary notifications through newspapers and other media. Such a body could be disposed of in any manner such as burial, cremation, entombment or donation without restrictions. On the other hand, if the house officer decides that the death needs an inquest (a preliminary, fact-finding judicial inquiry by the magistrate or the inquirer into sudden deaths - ISD), then he should not fill the declaration of death form.
Instead, he has to request an inquest on the BHT from the hospital police post and the administrative head of the hospital. An inquest will be conducted either by the magistrate or the ISD depending on the type of the death.
At the end of the inquest, if the magistrate or the inquirer is satisfied with his findings that no foul-play had happened, then he will issue the Inquirer’s Certificate of Death to the legal claimant of the body.
He can use this instrument for the same purpose as the declaration of death for the disposal of the corpse. If, at the end of the inquest, the ISD or the magistrate feels that the death needs to be further scientifically investigated in to, to exclude foul-play, then he will temporarily with-hold issuing the Inquirer’s Certificate of Death and call upon a medical officer (nowadays usually a Judicial Medical Officer-JMO) to perform a Judicial/Medico-legalPost Mortem Examination (Autopsy) on the body.
This essentially consists of opening up of all body cavities, taking all organs out and dissecting them. A judicial autopsy also includes obtaining history of the deceased, scene visit, identification, preliminary procedures such as photography, video-taping and X-raying the body, examination of the clothing, external examination, internal examination, investigations (such as histopathology, toxicology, bio-chemistry, microbiology, DNA, anthropology, odontology etc), documentation and reporting.
At the end of the post-mortem examination, if the JMO is satisfied as to the cause of death and other prospective medico-legal issues, then he will submit the Certificate of Medical Cause of Death not to the legal claimants of the body but to the magistrate or the ISD who has called upon the doctor to carry out the autopsy.
Depending on this certificate, the ISD or the magistrate may issue his Inquirer’s Certificate of Death. If the doctor is confronted with medico-legal issues which need further investigations during the autopsy, the doctor will not issue the certificate of medical cause of death at the end of the post-mortem examination.
Instead, he will convey the ISD or the magistrate that this death is “Under Investigation”. At that point, the ISD or the magistrate will proclaim an “Open Verdict” regarding the death and allow the body to be only buried reserving the provision to disinter if need arises at a later date.
When the death is under investigation at the autopsy, the doctor will obtain routine tissue samples from all organs (mainly the suspicious organs) and injuries for histopathology, samples for toxicology and upon the discretion of the doctor for other investigations such as microbiology, bio-chemistry etc.
Once the results of these lab tests are available, the doctor will in most occasions be able to give a proper cause of death which he will inform the magistrate or the ISD. Then, the magistrate or the ISD will revert his initial open verdict and issue the proper inquirer’s certificate of death. Even when the doctor issues a certificate of medical cause of death, the magistrate or the ISD is empowered to proclaim an open verdict if he believes that there are other issues (not related to forensic medicine) around the death.
Let us briefly discuss the law related to the disposal of death in Sri Lanka. These are dealt with in sections 9, 369-373 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act (No. 15 of 1979). Section 9 empowers a magistrate to inquire into certain types of deaths occurring in his jurisdiction. The types of deaths included here are deaths in prisons, mental or leprosy hospitals, deaths due to violence, accidents, sudden deaths and where the cause and manner of death are uncertain. Section 369 restricts the conduct of an inquest to the provisions given by the Criminal Procedure Code.
Section 370 describes the procedure to be adopted by the ISD in conducting an inquest and further describes the judicial powers vested upon the ISD. It also lists the types of deaths warranting an inquest as; deaths due to suicide, killed by an animal, machinery or accident and deaths due to unknown causes.
Section 371 exclusively empowers a magistrate to hold an inquest into a custody death. Section 372 deals with recording of evidence at the inquest and the discretion the magistrate or the ISD has, to hold an inquest either in a public forum or as a private forum excluding the public from viewing and participating in the inquest on special grounds of public policy or expediency.
Section 373 deals with the powers the magistrate or the ISD has, to call upon a medical officer to conduct a judicial post-mortem examination and the power the magistrate alone (not the ISD) has to disinter an already buried body for the purpose of a post-mortem examination.
In every science and art in the world the principles and the practice may not be the same though in the ideal situation there should be no gap between the two. The same applies to law and medicine. The practice related to requesting an inquest by doctors is a rare example which goes beyond the principles.
In other words, in day to day practice in hospital settings the doctors do not strictly confine themselves to the indications listed in sections 9 and 370 of the Criminal Procedure Code when requesting an inquest.
The following deaths in hospitals are subjected to an inquest: deaths where the cause of death is unknown, all unnatural deaths (accidents, suicides and homicides) even when the cause of death is known, deaths due to suspicious circumstances, deaths due to criminal circumstances, deaths due to animals, deaths due to machinery, deaths due to tetanus, deaths due to rabies, deaths in custody, maternal deaths, deaths where there is a potential for an allegation of medical negligence.
This practice is adopted to ensure maximum justice to the deceased, his kith and kin as well as to the society and to be optimally transparent in provision of medical care and services.
A death in a hospital ward may fulfill one or more than one of the above criteria to warrant an inquest. If a death does not come under any one of the above criteria, in that case an inquest is not necessary and should not be requested since it serves no purpose and only harasses already bereaved and disturbed relatives.
For example there is a perpetuating practice among the medical staff in the majority of the wards in Sri Lanka to request an inquest merely when the death has taken place within the first 24 hours of admission even when it does not fulfill any one of the above criteria.
This practice had been abolished by a departmental circular several decades ago though it never seems to fully wither away! A natural death where the cause of death is known and where there is no suspicion or allegation of medical negligence could be released from the ward by filling the declaration of death form by the house officer and handing it over to the legal claimant of the body, irrespective of the period of stay in the hospital.
Let us discuss some practical situations encountered in the wards to have a better insight into the indications of an inquest.
• A 75-year-old diagnosed patient of ischaemic heart disease, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia, with one previous episode of myocardial infarction is admitted with a classical retrosternal chest pain radiating along the left arm, sweating and faintishness. His ECG done in the ward following admission was conclusive of an acute coronary event in the background of previous ischaemic episodes.
Troponin I was significantly elevated and cardiac enzymes were positive. He was managed as for an acute heart attack with best available resources in the ward. The patient developed acute left heart failure despite treatment which is a common occurrence in massive heart attacks and died within 14 hours of admission. The cause of death is known and natural. The relatives are impressed with the effort of the medical staff to save the life of their loved one. In this situation the house officer can release the body by compiling the declaration of death form. There is no indication whatsoever for an inquest. The mythical concept of 24 hour time barrier should be boldly abandoned.
• The same patient was admitted to the OPD and the medical officer on duty pronounced death on admission. In this case, an inquest is a must despite the very convincing medical history. It is prudent to consider all deaths on admission as suspicious deaths and as deaths where the cause of death is unknown.
• A young male motorcyclist sustained gross pelvic fractures and spinal injuries following a road traffic accident. He was admitted to the orthopaedic unit and was surgically intervened. As a result of prolonged bed riddenness, he developed bed sores and despite vigorous treatment succumbed to death following septicaemia and multi-organ failure during the third month of admission to hospital. Despite the prolonged hospital stay, this death needs an inquest as the original cause leading to the hospital admission is unnatural (ie: an accident) and as there is always a potential risk of an allegation against the medical staff.
• A detainee from the then Bogambara Prisons was admitted to a medical ward in the Teaching Hospital Kandy with fever, shortness of breath and other classical features of lower respiratory tract infection. With relevant blood investigations and x-rays he was diagnosed of having left sided lower lobar pneumonia. He was treated adequately. Yet, on the fifth day he developed type ii respiratory failure and died. There was no allegation of medical mismanagement and the cause of death is known and natural. Still the prudent house officer of the ward has correctly requested an inquest as this death should be considered as a death in custody. For a death to be considered as a “custody death” the doctors should consider the broadest possible meaning of the term custody. One should not necessarily die under the roof of custody for it to be called a death in custody. The immediate period of time before arrest, after arrest, stay in the place of custody, transportation from one place of custody to another etc. should be taken in to consideration. Further, it should be understood that one could be kept in lawful as well as in unlawful custody.
If a suspect is retained in the police cell for prolonged periods without being produced before a magistrate, the initial lawful custody automatically becomes an unlawful custody with the passage of prescribed time interval. If a person is detained lawfully or unlawfully at any place without or against the free will of that individual, it automatically becomes custody. When a person is deprived of his freedom of movement and retained in custody, a heavy duty regarding the well being of that individual automatically befalls on the shoulders of the state. One aspect of delivering this duty is to conduct an inquest on all custody deaths in their widest meaning, to ensure that no foul-play has taken place. Coming back to the prisoner at Bogambara Prisons who died at Kandy Teaching Hospital, his pneumonia could have been resultant of a lung contusion (which could act as a focus of infection) which occurred due to a dented rib following an attack by a rival gang of inmates or a jailor in the prisons which took place several days prior to hospital admission. The fractured rib was missed in the postero-anterior view of the chest x-ray taken to best visualise the lung fields and later discovered only during the post mortem examination subsequent to the magisterial inquest.
 
• A married woman employed in a Middle East country (whose husband was in another country) became pregnant out of wedlock and used an abortifacientpessary few days prior to returning to Sri Lanka without the knowledge of the husband. She has secretly delivered the baby possibly without medical care or aborted the foetus without anybody else’s knowledge with large parts of retained products of conception (placenta and membranes) still within the uterus. She became severely ill and consulted a specialist VOG in private sector.
The consultant, in bona fide intention of saving the life of the woman, had admitted her to a private nursing home and carried out a surgery to evacuate the retained products of conception. She was then admitted to the ICU of the same private hospital where her condition continued to deteriorate. As she was financially unstable to go for another major operation in the private sector, the VOG transferred her to the local base hospital where he was in charge of the gynaecology ward. With the help of the specialist General Surgeon of the same base hospital the VOG opened her up for the second time to find features of septicaemia and multi-organ failure. Both specialists have done their best to save the life of the woman though she died in the ICU of the base hospital two days following the second surgery. The medical officer in charge of the ICU had requested an inquest for the death. The inquirer into sudden deaths (ISD) assigned for the base hospital called upon the medico-legal medical officer of the same hospital to carry out the judicial autopsy. The medical officer who possessed no post-graduate exposure in Forensic Medicine or any special training or experience to handle a complicated case of this calibre prudently declined to do the post-mortem and advised the police sergeant who was at the verge of his retirement to go back to the ISD and get a new order addressing the Consultant Judicial Medical Officer in the nearest Teaching (tertiary care) Hospital. The police sergeant instead of going back to the ISD, altered the original letter addressed to the medical officer of the base hospital with Tipex and approached the Consultant Judicial Medical Officer who was in charge of the post-mortems on that day at the teaching hospital.
The police officer, the sister and the brother-in-law of the deceased adamantly said that there is no doubt what so ever from their side and that they are not worried about the surgical management. They also said that they are in a real hurry to cremate the body.
In the mean time the much disturbed VOG personally contacted the consultant JMO and expressed his concerns. The consultant JMO considered the following facts: The husband of the deceased who is the legal claimant of the body was unaware of the death and was not in the country. The deceased had seemingly undergone a criminal abortion (perhaps with the possibility of infanticide as well).
Two consultant medical specialists and one private nursing home and one government hospital are involved with the scenario (though both specialists have acted in good faith for the best interest of the patient, later on their could be allegations of medical negligence from third parties-therefore exonerating the two specialists becomes a need in this case).
The cause of death is not known and much complicated with the theory of causation creeping into the picture. Obviously the circumstances are suspicious and possibly have some criminal elements too.
Furthermore, there was no proper order from the ISD of the local hospital except for a forged document altered by the police officer with his own hand writing which was obviously different to the original hand writing of the ISD on the rest of the order. The consultant JMO who had almost two decades of exposure in forensic practice was well aware of the ‘witchcraft’ and ‘black-magic’ often practiced by certain categories of officers involved with death investigation for pecuniary gain and he sensed the same through his gut feeling in this instance too.
Cumulatively this was no other than an attempt to hide a secret crime. In such situations the standard practice among the Forensic Specialists in Sri Lanka is to advice the police officer to inform the same to the magistrate of the area and obtain a magisterial order for the inquest.
This is not written law but the standard practice developed for years beyond the memory of the oldest man alive, to help the criminal justice system to overcome problems created due to corruption among some police officers and inquirers. Requesting the police to obtain a magisterial order is by no way an insult to the judicial powers vested upon the ISDby section 370 of the CPC but merely an SOS signal to the Magistrate that some irremediable mischief is likely to occur if he does not take over the inquest! In this case, the police sergeant instead of explaining the situation to the magistrate; has apparently misinformed him that the consultant JMO has blatantly refused to conduct a post-mortem examination.
Though the magistrate was one with inviolate and immaculate professional integrity and remarkable knowledge of principles of law, at this point he was surprisingly gullible enough to believe the police officer’s version and gave a direction to the ISD of the base hospital that he may act according to the powers vested upon him by the section 370 of the CPC if any doctor refuses to obey his orders.
The next day morning, the same police sergeant came to the same teaching hospital where the body was, with the direction of the magistrate and met the consultant JMO who happened to be on duty that day. An extensive post-mortem examination was conducted by a post-graduate registrar in Forensic Medicine, all necessary samples were taken and it was concluded as “under investigation” until the test results were available and this was conveyed to the ISD of the local hospital.
The process of disposal of death is complicated and is not fool proof.
A thorough re-visit to the system is absolutely necessary to reorganise the system to minimise the loop holes and avoid corruption.
Officers in the judiciary, medical field and fields of scientific investigations should be aware of the practical pitfalls and loopholes and should develop the skill and “gut feeling” to sense any possibility of foul play.
