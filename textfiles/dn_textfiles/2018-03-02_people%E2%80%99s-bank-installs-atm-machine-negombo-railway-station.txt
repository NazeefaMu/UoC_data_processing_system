People’s Bank installs  ATM machine at Negombo  Railway Station

People’s Bank recently unveiled an Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) at the Negombo Railway Station. With the installation of the new ATM, residents of the area as well as the commuters will be able to withdraw cash conveniently 24 hours a day and 365 days a year.
The installation of ATMs at the railway stations is implemented by the People’s Bank in collaboration with the Ministry of Transport, with the aim of providing convenient and secure banking service to hundreds and thousands of daily commuters across the island. This program is implemented under People’s Bank’s Digitalization drive in conjunction with Railway Department’s modernization and beautification initiative which aims to transform railway stations into public attractions.
