Fire at Batticaloa Waste Management Centre

The Solid Waste Management Centre situated at Thiruperunthurai, Batticaloa experienced a major fire early this morning at around 1.00 a.m. (22).
The fire was still raging yesterday because water for the Municipal Council fire fighters as well as police had to be brought in bowsers from outside the area. The bursting of Asbestos sheets was hampering the work of the fire fighters.
The officials said that it would take several days to bring the fire completely under control. This waste management centre is managed by the Batticaloa Municipality who are running a waste segregation centre as well as a compost making centre.
The residents of the area had earlier protested against the dumping of garbage because it was a health hazard. Batticaloa DIG Yagoda Arachchi, SSP Batticaloa Saman Yaddawera and Batticaloa Municipal Commissioner are at the scene the fire.
