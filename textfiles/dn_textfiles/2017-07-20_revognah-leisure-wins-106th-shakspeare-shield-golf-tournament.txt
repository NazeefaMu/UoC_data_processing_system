The annual Shakspeare Shield Golf Championship is the oldest corporate competition registered on the Board of RCGC.
The Shakspeare Shield is an annual Board event, being the only tournament open to members and teams of registered companies, the Diplomatic Community, Government Departments, Armed Forces, the Police and service organisations.
The format of the tournament is structured to make it a one-day stableford event, thereby making it more exciting and narrowing the team’s margin for error. Five categories were included in the tournament including team scoring maximum birdies, team scoring best gross score on par five holes, team scoring best gross score on front nine, team scoring best gross score on back nine and team scoring best gross score on six hidden holes.
The Shakspeare Shield Golf Championship is named after W. Shakspeare, a former Chairman of Carson Cumberbatch, who was elected to the Committee in 1908. Shakspeare initiated the first Foursomes competition exclusively for private companies, banks and state institutions. The tournament was initiated in his honour in 1911 and has been an annual event, since then. Carson Cumberbatch continues its commitment towards golf and upholding the former Chairman’s tradition of promoting inter-corporate goodwill, through sports.
