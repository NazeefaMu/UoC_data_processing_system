2018 Asia Rugby Sevens powered by Dialog
Tuskers look for a top finish in season finale

The Tuskers look to emulate last year’s performance on home turf in the final leg of the exciting Asia Rugby Sevens Series, powered by Dialog Axiata that will kick-off at the iconic Racecourse grounds on 13 and 14 October.
The final leg of the Asia Rugby Sevens Series, held in Sri Lanka, will be aired live on Dialog Television on Channel Number 1 on 14 October, and will also be available via live streaming on ThePapare.com and the Dialog MyTV mobile app on 13 and 14 October, with no additional data charges applicable for Dialog subscribers. Entrance will be free for the public and the tournament will kick off at 1:30 p.m. on the 13th and 10:00 a.m. on the 14th of October.
The Tuskers, after missing out on metal in the Hong Kong and South Korean legs of the Asian Rugby Sevens, are expected to put up a top three finish at the home venue. Defending champions Hong Kong are expected to retain the title challenge from Japan and South Korea. During the last two legs, Sri Lanka was edged out by a strong performance by the Philippines.
The final leg of the Asia Rugby Sevens Series is proudly powered by Dialog Axiata PLC, Sri Lanka’s most prolific promoter of sports, and the proud sponsor of the country’s national team.
