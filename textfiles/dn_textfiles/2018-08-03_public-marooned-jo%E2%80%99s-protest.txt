Public marooned in JO’s protest

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday said that if the government resorts to sell key State assets, a future government under his leadership will take measures to re-acquire them.
He was speaking at the Joint Opposition’s ‘Jana bala Sena’ protest campaign in Colombo. The JO could not muster a large gathering for their protest against the government in the Town Hall area despite claims to the contrary.
Public were highly inconvenienced during the afternoon rush hour as some JO members tried to block several main roads.
