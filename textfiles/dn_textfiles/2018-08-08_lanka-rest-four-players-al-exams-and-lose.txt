India levels five-match Under 19 series 2-all
Lanka rest four players for A/L exams and lose

The ongoing Advanced Level examination took its toll on the Sri Lanka under 19 team as they were forced to go into the fourth ODI against India without four of their regular players and eventually lost the match by 135 runs at the De Soysa Stadium, Moratuwa yesterday.
The win enabled India to level the five-match under 19 ODI series 2-all with the fifth and final series decider to be played at the same venue on Friday.
India winning the toss and choosing to bat first ran up a challenging total of 278-6 through half-centuries from opener Devdutt Padikkal who smashed 71 off 91 balls with one six and eight fours, skipper Aryan Juyal (60 of 67 balls, 5 fours) and Yash Rathod (56 off 60 balls, 5 fours).
Padikkal and Pavan Shah (36) put on 94 for the second wicket and Padikkal was also involved in another stand of 92 with Juyal. Sri Lanka without the services of Pasindu Sooriyabandara, Nishan Madushka, Nuwanidu Fernando and Lakshitha Manasinghe due to exams failed to match upto the Indian total and were dismissed for 143 with notable contributions coming from Navod Paranavithana (45) and Harsh Tyagi and Badoni claimed three wickets each to help bowl out Sri Lanka.
