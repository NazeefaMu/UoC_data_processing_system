We need caring homes!

Hi Everyone, bad enough the weather is so awful, we were dumped in the pouring rain as if we were of no consequence. Luckily for us we were rescued , if not we would have drowned !! Almost like as if we were caught up in Hurricane Irma.
We are two girls and one boy sterilized, four months old and are cute, loving, playful and are dying for a permanent home. Right now we are at a temporary shelter so we need to be grabbed real fast.
Please call Rosy 0112910282.
Terms and conditions ; lots of good food, loads of cuddles. Chains and kennels Banned !
