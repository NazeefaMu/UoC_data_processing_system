Beyonce teaming up with Ed Sheeran for perfect remix

Ed Sheeran has recruited Beyonce for a remix of his single Perfect.
The Thinking Out Loud singer teased last week (ends26Nov17) that he had a remix for his love song featuring a huge collaborator coming out on Friday. And on Thursday, he announced it was Beyonce by sharing the artwork for the remix, which featured both their names, on Instagram. “Got Beyonce to duet with me on Perfect, comes out today at 7pm ET / 4pm PT / midnight GMT,” he wrote in the caption.
Speaking ahead of the release, Ed told Channel 4 Radio in the United Arab Emirates, “I’ve got something dropping next Friday. It’s a really f**king big deal.”
When asked what it will sound like, he replied, “The vibe is that it’s a remix to Perfect. I’m just basically going to Despacito Perfect.”
The British star was referring to the Spanish-language track Despacito by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee, which became a crossover chart smash around the world after Justin Bieber recorded verses for the remix.
Ed, 26, has worked with Beyonce before - they performed together at a Grammy tribute concert for Stevie Wonder and at Global Citizen Festival in 2015. He told People magazine in March that she is the top of his list of artists to collaborate with in the studio.
“After having sung with Beyonce, I’d say she’s always top of my list,” he said. “Even just standing near her onstage makes me look better - just because she’s really that amazing. She has this aura around her of just talent.
“Rehearsing with her, hearing her sing up close is just a thing to marvel. Even if my career ended tomorrow, I’ll still be able to tell my grandkids that I got to sing with Beyonce. She will be remembered as one of the greats.”
Beyonce has featured on a few tracks this year (17) - most notably Eminem’s recent single Walk on Water and on a remix of J Balvin’s Latin hit Mi Gente. The original Perfect is currently in the top five in both the U.K. and U.S. singles charts. Music News
