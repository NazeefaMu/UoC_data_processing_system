Fielding is hard work – Gurusinha

Asanka Gurusinha, cricket manager of the Sri Lanka team described fielding as “hard work”.
“To me it’s a very simple thing its hard work. I saw that report about flat feet and all of that but it comes down to hard work in everything whether you bat or bowl you’ve got to field,” said Gurusinha.
“I believe from the time I came we didn’t spend enough time doing fielding training. I was very vocal about it internally because I realized if we go on like that we will never get anywhere. We have changed a lot its still work in progress.
“Nic Pothas coming in has changed the intensity of training. It’s so sad that in the Champions Trophy just one game ruined everything for us because until then we were pretty good although not brilliant. We have improved from Bangladesh but just one game brought us back pretty much to where we were. This side has to lift that standard and do it under pressure. Working hard to me is a very simple thing,” he said.
Fielding has become a major issue with the national cricket team with simple catches being spilled and a lot of misfields taking place on the field that has left many cricket fans tearing their hairs out.
Gurusinha attributes the drop in Sri Lankan fielding standards to the players not being put through their paces by the local coaching staff.
“With Nic we can see things changing. Nic is very hard working as a person and his work ethic is unbelievable. It will come down to the team to work that hard and I can see that happening,” said Gurusinha.
“This morning we had a session it was only a short 20-25 minutes but the intensity was very high and the players did brilliantly. That’s what I like to see and that’s pretty much like we used to do. We might do short sessions but then we will do it very well. With some young guys in I am hoping our standard will lift but we need to be consistent.”
Gurusinha was part of a Sri Lankan team that was brilliant in its fielding and went onto win the Cricket World Cup in 1996 under the guidance of coach Dav Whatmore and physio Alex Kountouri.
