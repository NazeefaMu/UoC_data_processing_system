‘HUTCH Sri Lanka Super Series 2018’ offers amazing prizes

The 2018 motoring season is set to flag off in grand style as the HUTCH Sri Lanka Super Series 2018 conducts the first of its ten racing events later this month. Powered by HUTCH, the 2018 edition of the Sri Lanka Super Series takes place in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Association of Racing Drivers and Riders (SLARDAR) and the Asian Motor Racing Club (AMRC). This was revealed to the media during launching ceremony at the DIMO 800 Auditorium under the patronage of the chief guest Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara recently.
The ten racing events of the HUTCH Sri Lanka Super Series 2018 will include the Katukurunda Circuit Meet, Fox Hill Supercross, Walawe Supercross, Kanway Auto Drome Circuit Meet, Colombo Supercross, Cavalry Supercross, Commando Challenge Supercross, Lions Top Speed – Katukurunda Circuit Meet, Pannala Night Races, Kanway Auto Drome Circuit Meet (Motorcycles Only) and Katukurunda Circuit Meet II while the season will end in November with the Awards Ceremony.
For the first time in Sri Lanka, two Rookie Cup events for both cars and bikes are to be introduced. Titled “The McLaren Formula Rookies Cup for Novice Drivers” and “Honda One Make Series for Rookie Riders”. The two Rookie events will be held at Katukurunda, Pannala and in addition the two Rookie bike events will be held Mirigama Circuit as a part of Super Series Championship event with the objective of providing much-needed racing experience to new race drivers and riders, thereby paving the way for local racing talent to excel at regional and global level.
SLARDAR has already given its nod to support a “TRI Nation championship” organized by the world controlling body, FIM and also initiated in bringing down the Asian Supermotard Championship to Mirigama. These moves would undoubtedly put Sri Lanka on the map of racing and open doors to many more Lankans to race on foreign soil.
Across the ten main events, Sri Lanka’s finest drivers and riders will battle it out to be crowned the “Champion Driver” and “Champion Rider” by the end of the year. The Champion Driver and the Champion Rider will receive a brand-new car each courtesy of Maxxis Tyres and co-sponsored by Mobil as the Lubricant Partner as well as Promowatch as the Event Partner. Additionally, the two winners of the second most popular support race event classes in cars and motorcycles in the supporting events - the Ford Laser/Mazda 1500cc &the Supermotard Open - will receive a brand-new Honda Unicorn motorcycle each courtesy of Stafford Motor Company. All awards will be handed over at the gala awards ceremony to be held in November at the Eagles’ Lakeside Banquet and Convention Hall, Attidiya.
Kamil Hussain – President of SLARDAR stated, “SLARDAR has always been instrumental in taking Sri Lankan motor racing in a new direction in a responsible manner. Last year, we gave away a brand-new car and motorcycle in the highly-successful inaugural Sri Lanka Super Series. This year, we are proud to announce that for the first time in Sri Lanka, two brand new cars and two brand new motorcycles will be awarded to the winners.
We believe that this extraordinary gesture will help enhance the competitiveness of the series and encourage the drivers and riders to perform at a higher level than ever before in order to be the overall winner and bag the coveted prizes.”
