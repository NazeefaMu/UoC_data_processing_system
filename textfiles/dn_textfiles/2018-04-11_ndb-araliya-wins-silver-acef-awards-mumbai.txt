NDB Araliya wins Silver at  ACEF Awards Mumbai

NDB was felicitated with the Silver award for “Best Celebrity Endorsement” at the 7th Global Customer Engagement Awards by the Asian Customer Engagement Forum (ACEF) in Mumbai.
The award was won using Umaria Sinhawansa as the Best Celebrity Endorsement for the Women’s Savings Account, Araliya.
The Bank’s Araliya savings product initiative was exclusively designed to understand and support the needs of today’s women, who play multiple roles in their lives, to save money in order to realize the bigger and long term targets. The product was created to provide a steady foundation for the women in Sri Lanka and, NDB signed an exclusive contract with popular Sri Lankan Singer Umaria Sinhawansa.
At the time of the Araliya launch, only a few banks in the market offered specialized women’s accounts with special benefits to female customers emphasizing mostly on gift schemes and emotion. It was seen that there is a need of having a women’s savings product which combines all requirements of a timely account proposition along with additional benefits.
