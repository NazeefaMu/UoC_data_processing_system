Beware the next Asian debt crisis

The U.S. Federal Reserve’s latest interest hike this week is an uncomfortable reminder to Asian borrowers about the risks of financial complacency.
Businesses and households in the region have for too long appeared oblivious of the danger of a new debt crisis, despite growing warnings of such risks -- and the fact that even after two hikes already in 2018, the Fed is signaling there are more to come before the year is out.
Can Asian debtors have been lulled into a false sense of security by steps taken after the 1997 Asian crisis to prevent a recurrence, or is it just that debt crises are rarely foreseen until it is too late?
Corporate and personal debt has reached record levels around the world, including in Asia, in terms of absolute amounts of money involved. Moreover, in a number of Asian economies (China, South Korea and Japan stand out) the ratio of debt to gross domestic product is well in excess of that in most economies elsewhere.
Multilateral institutions, notably the International Monetary Fund, are sounding the alarm. But clear signs of distress are already evident closer to home.
In India, the government-owned State Bank of India, the largest lender, has just reported its biggest ever quarterly loss of $1.1 billion owing to bad loans. In China, bad loan ratios are low relative to those elsewhere but the government and state-controlled lenders have been cracking down heavily -- and publicly -- on companies seen as over-borrowed, such as property group Dalian Wanda Group.
These developments predate the upward run in U.S. interest rates, which is pushing up borrowing costs across Asia -- notably in Indonesia where the central bank has hiked rates to defend a fragile rupiah. Malaysia and the Philippines raised rates earlier in the year. India followed suit with an increase this month.
Across Asia, corporate borrowers are feeling the squeeze from rising borrowing costs. Investors in Asian companies’ high-yield bonds are now demanding a 6.8% yield against 5.1% in January and the spread over U.S. high-yield bonds has widened to 0.7 percentage points from negligible levels. Emerging market borrowers, especially in China, South Korea and India, face high refinancing risks this year and next as debts are rolled over.
The Asian crisis should have made this region ultra-sensitive to the danger of debt crises. Instead, there seems to be an unwarranted degree of complacency that all is well, and debt continues to pile up, having surged especially in 2017.
