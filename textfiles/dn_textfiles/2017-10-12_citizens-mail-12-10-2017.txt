CITIZENS' Mail - (12-10-2017)

What is the role of youth?
Youth are the backbone of any nation. They can change the future of society with their well-being and courageous behaviour. They are here to show us that which we have not been willing to look at within ourselves.
Unfortunately today, we find the youths more interested in other places not quite useful to them as well as the nation.
They choose drugs and video games. More and more young men of this age group are sitting at home in front of their televisions playing games all day instead of bettering themselves or going to work.
They have no vision and if they do have dreams they do not have the drive to make any attempt at achieving them.
We must get control of this and motivate our youth. We must teach responsibility and goal-setting. I fear if we do not, we will soon be supporting an entire generation of the homeless and needless on welfare families.
Things have to change with our schools with the older generation being good role models. With the older generation being mentors and with the youth who are right now doing nothing, you have a choice. You can allow yourselves to stay faithful to your course and do nothing or you can rise above what the cynics around you expect and get educated or get jobs. You might be surprised at how proud you can be yourself.
I can tell you that nothing can happen if you do not try. Key role to youth in society is to renew, refresh and maintain a civilization.
