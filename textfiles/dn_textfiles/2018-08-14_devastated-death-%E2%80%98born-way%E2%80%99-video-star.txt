Devastated by death of ‘Born This Way’ video star

Lady Gaga has paid tribute to her ‘Born This Way’ video co-star Rick Genest in an emotional series of tweets following his death on August 1.
The heavily-tattooed model and artist, also known as Zombie Boy, was found dead in his apartment in Montreal, Canada from an apparent suicide at the age of 32 last Wednesday.
On Thursday night, Lady Gaga, who recruited Genest for the video to her 2011 song, paid tribute to her co-star on Twitter by sharing a series of pictures and called on those suffering with mental health issues to reach out to somebody.
“The suicide of friend Rick Genest, Zombie Boy is beyond devastating,” she wrote. “We have to work harder to change the culture, bring Mental Health to the forefront and erase the stigma that we can’t talk about it. If you are suffering, call a friend or family today. We must save each other.
“Science tells us that it takes 21 days to form a habit, if you are suffering from Mental Health issue I beckon for today to be your first day or a continuation of the work you’ve been doing. Reach out if you’re in pain, and if you know someone who is, reach out to them too.”
The 32-year-old also encouraged her followers to sign up to her charity, the Born This Way Foundation, before the autumn, when she will “explore the power of habits to build cultures of kindness and wellness.”
