Staff shortage at Dehiattakandiya base hospital

The Dehiattakandiya base hospital coming under the purview of the Eastern Provincial Council is receiving step motherly treatment from the Provincial Council despite the facility being upgraded as an ‘A’ grade hospital in response to a request made to the President, alleged Ven. Morawaka Narada, Chief Adhikarana Sanghanayake Thera of the Mahaweli ‘C’ zone.
The Thera said that the hospital had been facing a shortage of staff of all grades for the last five years. Although several other hospitals in Batticaloa, Kalmunai, Akkaraipattu, Samanthurai and Nintavu had excess staff, the Provincial Health Ministry had failed to transfer such excess staff to the Dehiattakandiya hospital despite repeated requests.
Presently, there is an urgent need to fill existing vacancies created by the retirement, transfer and death of nearly 30 staff members. Ven. Morawaka Narada Thera said a new dialysis unit and a drug store were opened at the hospital by Deputy Health Minister Faisal Cassim.
It is learnt that plans are afoot to build a five storeyed OPD building and an ICU unit at the hospital. This would create a need for atleast 80 additional staff for the hospital according to a senior hospital official. The hospital catered to nearly 200,000 residents in the Mahaweli C. Zone.
The Thera said he hoped that atleast the Eastern Province Governor would look into the shortcomings of the hospital since he had taken over the administrations of the Eastern Provincial Council which is now defunct.
