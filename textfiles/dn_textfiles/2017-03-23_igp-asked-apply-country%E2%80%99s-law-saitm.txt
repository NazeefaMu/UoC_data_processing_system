IGP asked to apply country’s law to SAITM

The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) has sent a letter to Inspector General of Police Pujitha Jayasundara requesting him to implement the country`s law in connection with SAITM, GMOA Secretary Dr. Navin de Zoysa said.
Addressing the media at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said SAITM is an illegal and fraudulent company which has collected Rs. 6 to 12 million from a student since 2009. Around 900 students have been subjected to this financial scam. According to information provided by parents, the company is sending funds to Russia in an informal method.
Dr. Zoysa said the fraud at SAITM is only second to the recent `Bond Scam' of the Central Bank. Relevant documents will be presented during a Police investigation. The company was investigated some time back in connection with harbouring the bones of sportsman Wasim Thajudeen, he said.
Police commenced an investigation on the `shooting drama' staged by the SAITM CEO. Culprits are still to be brought before the law, Dr. Zoysa said.
