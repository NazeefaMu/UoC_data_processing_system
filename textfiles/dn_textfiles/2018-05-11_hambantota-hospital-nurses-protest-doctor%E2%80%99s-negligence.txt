Hambantota Hospital nurses protest doctor’s negligence

Hambantota Hospital nurses protested against the probe to be conducted in connection with taking the Hambantota Nurses’ Training School principal to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the same hospital, after he was neglected at the Emergency Care Unit (ETU) of the hospital, following a heart attack.
The nurses protested for three hours against the investigation. Hambantota NTS Principal R. M. Ariyasena was admitted to the hospital at 6.00 pm after suffering from a heart attack. Nurses had then transferred him to the ICU at 6.50 pm from the ETU, without the required medical treatment. The ICU doctors had stated that the principal died due to the delay in administering him the required medical treatment at the ETU.
Hospital authorities had charged the nurses for carrying a dead body to the ICU. A doctor at the ETU had made the complaint against the nurses to the Health Services Director General. Nurses said the investigation was not on the doctor responsible for the death of the principal, but against those who tried to save his life at the last moment.
