Soheto Group Colombo distributor for Sony Broadcast Solutions

Soheto Group Colombo, the distributor for Sony Broadcast and Professional equipment, announced the line-up of its product portfolio at an event attended by a gathering of Sri Lanka's broadcast industry. Soheto Colombo is parented by Soheto Singapore, one of the largest distributors for Sony products in South East Asia and directors of Dynamic AV Technologies Colombo.
Since 1999, Soheto Singapore begun their journey by being the sole authorized distributor for Sony Broadcast and Professional equipment in Cambodia and has maintained a strong partnership with Japan's largest consumer and electronics giant, Sony Corporation.
The SOHETO Group Colombo management comprises Chairman Henry Tay, Malik Fernando, Mohan Abeyasinghe, Naomal Abeysekere, Dhanushka Fernando, and Nicolette Tay. Business development and strategy will be handled by Sudanga Fernando, who brings in over 16 years of marketing experience having worked overseas and locally in similar operations.
In his opening remarks, Director Mohan Abeyasinghe said, “We believe that we have the perfect combination to provide an excellent service coupled with industry knowhow. Together with SOHETO's guidance, our industry expertise and Sony's vast and unparalleled products, we see endless boundaries. This is synergy at its best.”
Also speaking at the event, director Nicolette Tay said, “Having worked very closely with Sony since 1999, we are happy to be able to provide Sony's cutting-edge products for Sri Lanka's broadcast industry. Our presence in countries across South East Asia prompted us to engage with Sri Lanka and provide the best of Sony's portfolio to you.”
Many of Sri Lanka's leading television studios already use Sony and they will now have easier access and the availability of a wider product range.
Yuichi Nishii, General Manager and Head of Asia Business Development of Sony South East Asia, addressed the gathering while Gog Lai Chye, Principle Engineer of Sony South East Asia demonstrated the products at the event.
Presently, Soheto has appointed SNA Trading and Clutch Automation as their authorized resellers in Sri Lanka.
