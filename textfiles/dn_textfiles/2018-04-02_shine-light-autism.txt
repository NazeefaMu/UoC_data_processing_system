Shine a light on autism

“On World Autism Awareness Day, let us reaffirm our commitment to promote the full participation of all people with autism, and ensure they have the necessary support to be able to exercise their rights and fundamental freedoms.” UN Secretary-General António Guterres
The eleventh annual World Autism Awareness Day falls today. Internationally on this day, buildings, homes and communities around the world, display blue lights in recognition of people living with autism.
In Sri Lanka too, the historic town of Kandy will illuminate several of the landmark buildings and sites in support of people with autism.
World Autism Awareness Day (WAAD) aims to put a spotlight on the hurdles that people with autism face every day. As a growing global health issue owing to its increasing exposure in the press and common knowledge, autism is an issue that is gaining more understanding and attention even in Sri Lanka.
Research carried out in the US two years ago points out that around one in every 68 people globally, is autistic. In Sri Lanka statistics from 2004 indicated that one person in every 100 was autistic. However, it is uncertain if this study included the entire country. According to medical experts, there is no specific study that has been done in the country in terms of determining the number of persons with autism in Sri Lanka.
What is autism?
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and autism are both general terms used to describe complex disorders of brain development. In most instances, those affected by autism may display varying degrees of difficulty in social interaction and verbal and nonverbal communication, and may also sometimes display repetitive behaviours.
According to experts in the field, autism appears to affect a person’s brain development at a very early stage. However, it is believed that generally the signs of autism begin to appear more prominently between the ages of two and three. In the early years, a child with autism may show signs of difficulty in communicating, both verbally and and non-verbally, but may repeat what is heard instead of expressing his or her feelings or emotions. People with autism have a tendency to repeat noises and phrases that they hear(echolalia). They may not be able to communicate effectively because they struggle to express their own thoughts. For example, someone with autismmight only be able to repeat a question rather than answer it.
People with ASD may exhibit unusual behaviour as a result of not being able to relate or respond to their surrounding environment. Some children and adults with autism may show signs of behavioural problems due to their heightened sensitivity to a sound or something they may have seen or felt.
Communication and interaction
For people with autism, interaction with others is a challenge. They are rather distant and shy away from direct physical contact or even direct eye contact. For someone with autism it is difficult to communicate not only verbally but also through facial and body language. They cannot express how they feel or what they need and also are unable to understand the needs of others, be it physical or emotional. People with autism also have trouble forming emotional relationships and they are unable to interpret others emotions or needs and at times appear distant and aloof. They prefer to keep to themselves and appear to live in their own little world. They may sometimes become stressed by merely being touched. This may also affect their ability to form sustainable relationships due to their difficulties with social and emotional responsiveness.
While some of the characteristics are common, in terms of language, each individual could have varying levels of communication abilities. Some could be fluent in language, while others could have varying levels of speech, and some could be completely non-verbal.
In most cases, people with autism may tend to repeat the same sentence over and over again and ask the same questions repeatedly and they may prefer to stick to a topic that interests them rather than a two-way conversation, making communication rather difficult.
In Sri Lanka, it is common for parents of a child with autism to feel isolated and desperate as even in modern times, acceptance that one’s child is different is difficult for them. Sometimes even family members and society tend to think that these children, with sometimes destructive behaviour, have just been badly brought up.
Autism campaign in Kandy
Speaking to the Daily News, the Consultant Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist at Sirimavo Bandaranaike Children’s Hospital, Peradeniya, Dr. Rasitha Perera said as World Autism Day starts from April 2, the world over, significant buildings are lit up in blue in support of autism. “However, this was not done in Sri Lanka previously, but for the first time in the country, we have taken the initiative to launch this programme in Kandy. Accordingly, we will light up the Bahirawa Kanda, Asgiriya Chaithya, the area around the Kandy Lake and Queen’s Hotel. We are going to shed a blue light on these places every evening from around 6 pm for around four hours to show the city’s commitment and support for those with autism. We have also initiated a media campaign to educate people on autism. The main programme was held yesterday under the patronage of the Central Province Governor Niluka Ekanayake.”
In treating autism, music has been proved to be an effective tool. However, it was not an area that was pursued in Sri Lanka as even autism was relatively ignored in the country in the past. According to Dr. Rasitha Perera, for the first time, even music therapy will be used at the Sirimavo Bandaranaike Children’s Hospital for the treatment of children with autism.
As approximately one in 68 of the world population is found to have a form of autism, it is not something that we can outgrow. However, being diagnosed early means that there is a better chance for treatment.
One of the reasons that music is being used in autism therapy is that it can stimulate both hemispheres of the brain, rather than just one. A therapist uses a song or instrument to support cognitive activity, so that a person with autism can build self-awareness and improve relationships with others. Music encourages communicative behaviour and can encourage interaction with others, which is something that autistic children have great difficulty with.
In this regard, veteran musician Nalini Ranasinghe who has done many songs especially for children, will also join in to make this endeavour a success.
“Further a book will also be launched, in Sinhala, which is a guideline to parents on how to handle and help children with autism. We have also commenced a poster campaign on how to detect autism. Usually the presenting age of autism is around four to five years and after a child enters school. However, the best time to detect the condition is before the child completes one year. Therefore, the poster campaign will indicate some of the red flag signs that can be used in detecting if a child is autistic,” Dr. Fernando said.
Early intervention offers the best chances
According to Dr. Perera, early intervention can offer a child with autism the best chances of overcoming most of the severe implications. “For instance, if a child seems to have not developed eye contact with the mother even by around six months, then this is an indicator that the child may be autistic. We don’t intend to label the child, but in the event the child is autistic, detecting it early will give us the chance to stimulate the child’s brain in order to get the best result.”
He noted that if a child has delayed speech and lacks social skills, parents should not wait hoping that it will correct itself. “They should get medical help. It is a developmental problem and we have to act then and there and we cannot buy time.”
He also said that in Sri Lanka, we have to battle the ancient beliefs that male children take longer to speak or speech is delayed because the child’s hair was cut too early. “These are just mythical beliefs and now that we have the facilities available to help these children lead a normal life, parents should also address this issue early, if it is detected in their child.”
Sharing the same sentiments as the previous doctor, the Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist at the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital, Dr. Udena Attygalle said the earlier you intervene the greater the benefit. “If you intervene when a child with autism is around two years, there is greater benefit than if you intervene at the age of 10.”
He emphasised the importance of early intervention (it’s much more easier to make changes that last if we intervene early), noting that there are red flag signs that indicate that something might be wrong and that parents should be encouraged to see a clinician immediately so that the child can be subjected to early intervention measures, as findings indicate that treatment has to be both intensive and effective.
For many years the subject of autism was swept under the carpet and even doctors were reluctant to take on the issue. But according to Dr. Attygalle, awareness is much better in Sri Lanka now than before. Services are also slowly developing, both through public and private initiatives.
It is also found that boys are more prone to autism than girls. There are a number of theories that might explain why more men and boys rather than women and girls get an autism diagnosis. Among them, one of the most accepted theories is that, overall, men and boys tend to be more susceptible to organic damage than women and girls (Rimland, 1964), whether through hereditary disease, acquired infection, or other conditions. Since it is now almost universally accepted that there is an organic cause for autism, it is possible that boys are more likely to be autistic, according to autism.org.uk. Various studies, together with anecdotal evidence, have come up with men–women ratios ranging from 2:1 to 16:1.
According to Dr. Attygalle, “Autism is thought to be a neurodevelopmental disorder, so it is something to do with how your brain gets wired during development. The social interactions and communication aspects of the brain get developed in a different way, in simple terms. Hence, this is found to be more common in boys than girls.”
However, as both doctors pointed out, early intervention is the only and best course of action in terms of dealing with autism and providing the best treatment.
Stem cell treatment
Meanwhile, Dr. Perera also noted that there have been claims that autism can be cured through stem cell treatment.
A study was done at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina and the goal was to see whether a transfusion of the children’s own umbilical cord blood containing rare stem cells could help treat their autism.
The results were positive it was said, with more than two-thirds of the children showing signs of improvement. Similarly, there are several Indian doctors who also claim to be able to cure autism through stem cell treatment.
However, sceptics say there are too many unanswered questions that need to be addressed before getting excited. Even Duke researchers acknowledge as much. The initial trial, published recentlyin the journal Stem Cells Translational Medicine, was a safety study, not a controlled, double-blind study with definitive proof of positive results.
Therefore, Dr. Perera warns that parents should be cautious when seeking such treatment as there is still no definite proof to suggest that this form of treatment is effective.
For now, the best available option is to detect the condition early in children and offer them the best chance they have at leading normal lives through therapy, both behavioural and occupational.
