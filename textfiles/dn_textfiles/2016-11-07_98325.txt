Brad Pitt seeks joint custody in divorce from Jolie

 
Brad Pitt is seeking joint custody of his six children in his split from Angelina Jolie, court filings show.
The move comes after Jolie asked for full physical custody of all the children, who are aged eight to 15.
Jolie cited "irreconcilable differences" when she filed to end the marriage on September 19.
Reports suggest that Pitt is being investigated over an incident with his eldest son Maddox on a plane.
A child welfare agency in Los Angeles is examining what happened during the incident on a private flight in mid-September, US media say.
The actors have reached a temporary agreement so the Fight Club star can visit his children while the welfare investigation continues.
California divorce courts generally favour joint custody, but the outcome of the plane row could affect the judge's decision. The actors may also hammer out a deal privately to avoid the matter being aired in public.

Pitt's custody request was included in his response to Jolie's divorce petition. He revealed that the pair separated on September 15, one day after the alleged plane altercation.
Pitt and Jolie have been together since 2004 but only wed in August 2014, at their children's urging. They grew close while filming the 2005 film Mr & Mrs Smith, in which they played a couple in a stagnant relationship.
Their union was Pitt's second marriage, after a divorce from Friends star Jennifer Aniston, and Jolie's third after Billy Bob Thornton and Jonny Lee Miller.
The couple have six children together - Maddox, Pax, and Zahara, who are adopted, and biological children Shiloh and twins Knox and Vivienne.
