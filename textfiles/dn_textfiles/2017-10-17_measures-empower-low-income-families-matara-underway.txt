Measures to empower low-income families in Matara underway

Measures have been taken to economically empower low-income families in the Matara district.
According to Director Conrad Ranawake of the Institute of Community Strengths in Matara, these projects have already been initiated at the Divisional Secretariat Division level in the district.
They are underway in the Matara, Weligama, Devinuwara and Dickwella DS divisions at the moment. Over 25 Grama Niladhari areas from each of these four divisions totaling 100, have been targeted to be economically empowered through these programmes.
One thousand low-income women, 2,750 women engaged in entrepreneurial development activities and 300 school leavers totaling 4,050 are anticipated to be economically empowered by them.
They would also be directed to income-generating avenues, skills development, vocational training and career guidance programs.
Those who successfully complete them would be provided with job opportunities in both public and private sectors. Necessary facilities would also be made available for them to be engaged in self-employment avenues, Ranawake said.
Resources available in the Matara district are utilized in this regard.
They would also be combined with women's entrepreneurial development activities currently commenced by the institute. Measures have been taken to provide them with loan facilities to start small and medium-scale self-employment projects as well.
The Institute for Development of Community Strengths, Matara, has also taken steps to direct women who are qualified for higher education and also school leavers, to vocational and technical training colleges. The economic empowerment of low-income women and their families would be the prime objective of these endeavours, he said.
The European Union and Save the Children International would assist in these welfare programmes, Ranawake added.
