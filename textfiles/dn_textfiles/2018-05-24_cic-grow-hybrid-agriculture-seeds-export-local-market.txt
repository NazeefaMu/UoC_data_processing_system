CIC to grow hybrid agriculture seeds  for export, local market

CIC Holdings PLC will be tying up with a South American company to grow hybrid agriculture seeds for exports and local use.  
Managing Director, Chief Executive Officer of CIC Holdings PLC, Samantha Ranatunga said that a team from the South American Company visited them last week and also visited some of the CIC sites. 
He said that they were also looking at growing sweet corn for which there is an increase in demand.   
Ranatunga said that in addition CIC was involved in growing high value vegetables in protected environments for export. For this they also launched Cropwiz (Private) Limited, and the company’s greenhouse complex of 7 hectares is located in Walpita, Divulapitiya.  
“We have invested over Rs. 1.4 billion for both these projects and it will support increasing national exports, provide around 80 new employment opportunities, and bring new technologies to expand frontiers of high tech agriculture systems in the country.”   
This facility in Divulapitiya is equipped with state-of-the-art high tech production facilities including automated climate control facility, computerized irrigation & fertigation system, physical and bio-security measures to minimize pest and disease occurrences and rainwater harvesting and irrigation water recycling system to ensure sustainability.   
The facility has been designed and constructed by Israeli experts to be in par with highest standards in modern greenhouse production systems in warm climates. The project constriction and commissioning is nearly completed now and once fully operational will be managed with growing and processing protocols in line with Global GAP (Good Agriculture Practices) standards to ensure product quality, safety, and traceability from seed-to-shelf. Automated sorting, grading and packaging facility and cold rooms are parts of the on-site integrated Greenhouse system to ensure freshness of the produce.  
The main products include, Bell Peppers Hydroponic Lettuce and herbs. The products will mainly be exported to Gulf countries and Singapore as customized packaging.  
He said that they have been investing heavily in the agriculture sector including paddy, dairy, plantains, agri seeds and also on research and development. “Though agriculture in not a high profit yielding business for our bottom line we keep moving in this direction to help the rural economy.”  
Ranatunga who is also the former Chairman of Chamber of Commerce said that it was sad to note that though 30% of employment is generated from the agri sector it contributes only less than 15% to national GDP. CIC Agri Businesses (Private) Limited also celebrated 25 years in the agri business recently. 
He also said that they have a huge farmer outgrow community over 40, 000 whom they support with a buyback program, technology, high yielding seeds and also bank loans. “We cannot turn our backs on them now.” He also said that they grow over 25 traditional Sri Lankan healthy rice varieties and these are even exported to many countries including USA. “We are also proud of the fact that CIC produce over 30% of local seed paddy and is the biggest exporter of bananas.
