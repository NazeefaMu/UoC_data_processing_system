Health Minister to take part in two key health forums

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne will take part in two key health conferences to be held in Germany and Uruguay, a Health Ministry spokesman said.
According to the spokesman, Minister Senaratne will take part in the World Health Summit 2017 to be held in Berlin, Germany from October 15 to 17.
He will deliver a lecture on the theme `Controlling Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs)’.
The summit will be inaugurated by German Chancellor Angela Markel.
A total of 1,600 participants including Health Ministers from 90 countries will take part in the summit.
There will be 250 sessions in the summit and 40 lecturers will deliver lectures.
Minister Senaratne will also take part in the Global Conference on Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) organized by the WHO held in Montevideo, Uruguay from October 18 to 20.
The WHO has identified Sri Lanka as the country which has taken the most successful steps to control NCDs in the region.
This is a significant achievement gained by Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka expects to reduce Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) by 30 percent by 2025.
