Trusting the coach paid dividends says Chandimal

MIRPUR: Sri Lankan skipper Dinesh Chandimal said that trusting their new head coach Chandika Hathurusingha paid dividends as it resulted in the team turning things around to clinch the tri-series in Bangladesh.
Sri Lanka were in dire straits before entering the tournament and began it in disastrous fashion before completing a remarkable turnaround.
Hathurusingha was the only new introduction in the Sri Lankan dressing room as he joined the Sri Lankan setup after relinquishing his post as Bangladesh's head coach. "We all know he is a really good coach. He gave confidence, to everyone. That's the main thing," said Chandimal after the win on Saturday.
"If you can trust your coach, good results will come. That's what he did. This is all about hard work from the players and the coach," he pointed out.
"He is the one who brought the team here, so credit goes to him also. It was a really happy moment to us. This is what we wanted, winning the series, we grabbed the opportunity with both hands. We are over the moon. This is all about hard work, especially after you lose the first two games, it is difficult to get back in this kind of tournament.
"The guys put their heart and soul in practice and then when they go to the middle they put their heart and soul. They had the plans and they executed it well, and credit goes to everyone who played the series," beamed Chandimal.
The skipper also credited Upul Tharanga and Niroshan Dickwella for their partnership which he believed changed the complexion of the game considering it was a difficult wicket to bat on.
"It was tough. I prayed before the toss, I need to win the toss. It was a dry wicket. Credit goes to Upul and Dickwella, they put on a 70-run partnership. That was the turning point," he said. "We knew after 20 overs that if we can get 220-230, that's a winning total for us."
Chandimal added that despite scoring a not so impressive total they were confident of winning as they believed they had some surprise to offer the hosts. It came in the form of right-arm pacer Shehan Madushanka who became the fourth bowler in history to claim a hat-trick on debut as Sri Lanka crushed Bangladesh by 79 runs.
Madushanka claimed Bangladesh's last three wickets as he finished with 3-26 to help Sri Lanka bowl out the Tigers for 142 runs in 41.1 overs after they were restricted to 221 runs.
Mashrafe, Gunathilaka guilty
Bangladesh captain Mashrafe Mortaza has been fined 20 per cent of his match fee, while Sri Lanka opener Danushka Gunathilaka has received an official reprimand for breaching Level 1 of the ICC Code of Conduct during the final of the tri-series in Mirpur on Saturday.
Both the players were found to have breached Article 2.1.7 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel, which relates to “using language, actions or gestures which disparage or which could provoke an aggressive reaction from a batsman upon his/her dismissal during an International Match.”
In addition to this, one demerit point each has been added to the disciplinary records of the two players.
While this was Gunathilaka’s first offence, Mashrafe has been sanctioned for the second time since the introduction of the revised Code in September 2016. He had received one demerit point for breaching Article 2.1.7 in the ODI series against England on 10 October 2016. As such, he now has two demerit points against his name.
The incident involving Mashrafe happened in Sri Lanka’s sixth over when the captain ran close to Kusal Mendis after he fell to Mehidy Hasan while yelling loudly and looking directly at the opener in a manner that could have provoked an aggressive reaction.
The incident involving Gunathilaka happened in the sixth over of Bangladesh’s innings when, following the dismissal of Tamim Iqbal, he yelled loudly at the departing batsman which prompted the opener to react by turning to face him. Both the players admitted the offences and accepted the sanctions proposed by David Boon of the Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Match Referees and, as such, there was no need for a formal hearing.
The charges were levelled by on-field umpires Chettithody Shamshuddin and Sharfuddoula, third umpire Bruce Oxenford and fourth umpire Anisur Rahman.
Level 1 breaches carry a minimum penalty of an official reprimand, a maximum penalty of 50 per cent of a player’s match fee, and one or two demerit points.
