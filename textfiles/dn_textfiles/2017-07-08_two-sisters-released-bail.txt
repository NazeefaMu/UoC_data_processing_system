Two sisters released on bail

Making false complaint over personal dispute:
A Woman Police Constable attached to Kegalle Police and her sister, who made a false complain with Pindeniya Police against an Army officer, were released on bail by Kegalle Magistrate Gayan Meegahage, recently.
The two sisters were released on Rs. 100,000 personal bail each after being produced before Courts by Pindeniya Police on the charges of making a false complaint against the Army officer.
The two had told Police that they were assaulted by the Army officer. Pindeniya Police who inquired into the complaint had found that the two sisters had made a false complaint against the Army officer over a personal dispute.
The two sisters had stated that they had been injured due to severe assault by the Army officer on March 20, when they were reporting for duty.
However, Police revealed that they were not assaulted by the Army officer. Accordingly, Pindeniya Police filed a case against the two sisters on the charge of making a false complaint over a personnel dispute.
The case will be heard again on October 24.
