THE BLACKLIST ON THE MINI SCREEN

American crime thriller series “The Blacklist” will be telecasting on Sirasa TV every Saturday at 10.30 pm.
The season was produced by Davis Entertainment, Universal Television, and Sony Pictures Television, and the executive producers are Jon Bokenkamp, John Davis, John Eisendrath, John Fox, and Joe Carnahan.
The season starts with Raymond Reddington surrendering to the FBI, establishing his bona fides by helping them to capture an international terrorist long thought to be dead. Red has special conditions for his help, he has to remain apparently free so that his contacts will still communicate with him and he will only give information to rookie FBI profiler Elizabeth Keen.
Does he have hidden motives for turning himself in to the FBI? Why he is insisting to speak only to the rookie FBI profiler Elizabeth Keen? There are surprising, yet entirely credible, twists throughout the television series which will definitely keep the viewers excited.
The first season of The Blacklist received strong reviews from television critics. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports an 83 percent approval rating based on 47 reviews, with an average rating of 7/10.
