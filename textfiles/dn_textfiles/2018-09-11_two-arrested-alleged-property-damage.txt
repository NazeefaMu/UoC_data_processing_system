Two arrested for alleged property damage

Police yesterday arrested two persons including a Vanathavilluwa Pradeshiya Sabha member of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (Phottuwa) for allegedly causing damage to public properties at a waste disposal yard being constructed at Aruwakkalu in Vanathavilluwa.
These two persons were involved in storming into this waste disposal yard and allegedly damaging the property during a protest held on Sunday.
People living in Karathiu and Therakkuliya staged a protest against this waste disposal site under construction and argue that this landfill project would cause groundwater contamination.
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka made an observation tour to the proposed garbage disposal site yesterday and reiterated that this site would not have any impact on the environment and the ground water.
The Minister added that waste will be brought to the site after compressing the garbage so that water in the garbage will be reduced by 80 per cent. The Aruwakkalu landfill project launched on Februaryn 1,2018 is to be completed in November next year.
