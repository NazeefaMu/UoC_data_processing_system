Alert Parliament employee saves the day

A fire which could have destroyed the Chamber of Parliament had been averted by an employee of the House Keeping Department on Monday, Parliament sources revealed yesterday.
The employee had seen a whirl of smoke from a high-powered wall lamp below the public gallery above the back benches of the MPs in the House of Parliament. Sources said that the employee had alerted the other staff and Police and subsequently had come there to remove all local and foreign visitors from the public gallery. The sources said by this time, a group of school children had been sitting in the public gallery. Sources also said that later it was found that a handkerchief of a student had mistakenly dropped and entangled on the wall-lamp. The handkerchief had fallen inside the lamp and caught fire after several minutes.
“The employee climbed down from the gallery using a flagstaff fixed near the gallery and removed the handkerchief and extinguished the fire,” sources revealed. “He avoided a great disaster which could have cost Parliament immensely.”
