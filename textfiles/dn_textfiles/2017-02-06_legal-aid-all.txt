Legal Aid for all

Legal assistance to the vulnerable groups of a country constitutes an important segment of the administration of justice. The Legal Aid Commission of Sri Lanka (LAC) is the foremost among the various other institutions and organisations that cater to this important requirement, mainly due to its sustainability and stability. The LAC was established by Act No 27 of 1978 and at present has 80 centres islandwide.
The vision of the LAC is to create a society where all deserving Sri Lankans irrespective of their economic or social status, gender, caste, creed or nationality or the disabled have equal access to justice. The mission of the LAC as stated in the Legal Aid Act No. 27 of 1978 is to provide Legal Aid to all “Deserving Persons” in the country.
