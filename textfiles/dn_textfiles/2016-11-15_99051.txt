Trump had acted in a film produced by Rutnam

US President-elect, Donald Trump, had acted in a Hollywood film co-produced by the veteran Sri Lankan film-maker Chandran Rutnam with actress Bo Derek.
It was the 1989 film ‘Ghosts Can’t Do It’ directed by John Derek. It had in the lead, Bo Derek and Anthony Quinn. The film was shot in Galle in South Sri Lanka, Thoddu in the Maldives, and the states of Wyoming and New York in the US.
“John Derek, the Director wrote a scene especially for Donald Trump to play himself in a cameo role. We shot the scene in the Board Room of the Trump Tower. It was a one day shoot and a delightful experience,” Chandran said.
“But the negative got scratched and we had to do it again. Trump happily agreed” Chandran recalled.
‘In Ghosts Can’t Do It’ Scott and Kate are happily married despite their 30-year age difference. After Scott suffers a heart attack and is unable to make love, he commits suicide and becomes a ghost that only Kate can see and speak with. To make it possible for Scott to return as a human, they conjure up a plan to have a young man drown so that Scott can take his body.
Bo Derek appeared as Katie Scott, Antony Quinn as Scott, Julie Newmar as Angel, and Donald Trump as himself. Sri Lanka’s versatile actor, Henry Jayasena, also appeared in the film.
Despite the star cast and excellent production values, ‘Ghosts Can’t do It’ bombed at the box office. It won the Stinkers Bad Movie Award, and Bo Derek the Worst Actress prize. Donald Trump was declared the Worst Supporting Actor at the Golden Raspberry Awards.
Chandran has sent a congratulatory message to Trump on winning the US Presidential election and invited him to Sri Lanka.
