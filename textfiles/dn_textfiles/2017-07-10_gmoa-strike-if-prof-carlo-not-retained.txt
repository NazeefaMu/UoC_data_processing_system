GMOA to strike if Prof. Carlo not retained

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) will commence an indefinite strike if the Health Minister appoints someone else other than Prof. Carlo Fonseka to the position of Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) President, GMOA Secretray Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo last evening, he said that if the Health Minister appoints someone else to the SLMC president’s position, it is a violation of the Sri Lanka Medical Ordinance.
According to the Ordinance the Health Minister has power to make the appointment but he does not have the power to remove the SLMC president.
“According to the Ordinance, the position falls vacant only due to the resignation of the President, through a proposal approved by the council or if the President pass away. Non of those had happened when it comes to Prof. Carlo Fonseka,” he said.
The GMOA received information that the Health Minister will appoint a person who is pro-SAITM and holding a position in an Ayurvedic Productions Company. This is purely a violation of the Ordinance. The entire country has been demanding the Minister to appoint Prof. Fonseka to the position and Prof. Fonseka had given his consent to the appointment. The President, the Prime Minister, the Cardinal and Mahanayaka Theras of three chapters had been informed about the issue, he added.
Professor Carlo Fonseka’s term of service came to an end on June 30 after serving for five and half years.The Professor’s official tenure was supposed to end on December 31, 2016, as a SLMC President’s tenure is generally valid for a period of five years. However, the Ministry of Health took steps to extend his tenure by 6 more months.
Speaking to the media after his term came to an end, Prof. Fonseka said that no request had been made by the government for an extension of his service.
