Science Minister promises more innovations

Science, Technology & Research Minister Susil Premajayantha said Sri Lanka lacked innovations, but the situation would change in the near future.
He was addressing a media event on Thursday evening.
“In our country, rarely can one see articles on innovations,” he said in an interview.
He said the problem started in schools, with a lack of focus on science, technology, engineering, and math education.
When people later have product ideas, very little infrastructure support their work and connect them to investors, he said.
“Instead, what we have to do is, promote our innovations, innovators, and match with entrepreneurs,” he said. Premajayantha said his ministry along with the Sri Lanka Inventors Commission would establish an innovation incubator, modeled after centers in Houston, Shanghai, and Japan.
“Innovators can come and use our lab equipment, our human resources, like engineers, and then they can use new technical know-how to market their products,” he said.
He promised a noticeable change in Sri Lankan innovation in the next two years.
