Point of view
Equity markets continued its uptrend for the 2nd consecutive week, aided by a slight uptick in Q2’17 GDP growth figures and waning concerns on the new IRD bill. Q2’17 GDP recorded a growth of 4% Y-o-Y, slightly higher than the 3.8% Y-o-Y growth recorded in Q1’17 as robust growth in the Services and Industrial sectors helped offset the Agriculture sector’s sixth quarter of negative growth.
The benchmark ASPI consequently rose ~25 points W-o-W, in line with the ~26 point increase in the previous week.
Average daily turnover levels however, declined to LKR 0.89 over the week, down 70% from last week’s notable daily average of LKR 2.95Bn amid the LKR 10.90Bn transaction in Singer Sri Lanka as Hayley’s acquired a 61.73% stake in the company.
This week’s average daily turnover however, is broadly in line with the YTD daily average of LKR 0.92Bn. Crossings over the week meanwhile, accounted for ~25% of total market turnover, driven by crossings in JKH & Madulsima Plantations.

Foreign investors meanwhile reverted to a net buying position once again this week, as foreign purchases rose to LKR 2.91Bn cf. sales of LKR 2.04Bn and compared to last week’s net selling position of LKR 10.91Bn in amid the transaction in Singer Sri Lanka.
Markets in the week ahead are likely to look for cues from next week’s monetary policy decision by the CBSL.
National inflation level rises to 7.9% in August
National inflation levels (NCPI) rose over the month of August, increasing to 7.9% Y-o-Y cf. 6.3% Y-o-Y in the previous two months of June and July.
The increase was in line with urban inflation levels which rose to 6.0% Y-o-Y in August (cf. 4.8% Y-o-Y in July 2017) and core CCPI levels which rose to 6.0% Y-o-Y (cf. 4.9% Y-o-Y in Jul7) both due the base effect and the monthly increase in Core CCPI in August.
Increases in both the Food and Non-food categories contributed towards the higher point-to-point inflation at the national level over August 2017.
On a monthly basis however, NCPI levels fell for the second consecutive month, driven primarily by decreases in prices of the items within the Food category.
Meanwhile, NCPI Core inflation, (which reflects the underlying inflation in the economy) increased to 4.8% in August, marginally up from the 4.2% Y-o-Y increase recorded the previous month; nevertheless, annual average NCPI Core inflation declined 5.8% in August cf. 5.9% July.
