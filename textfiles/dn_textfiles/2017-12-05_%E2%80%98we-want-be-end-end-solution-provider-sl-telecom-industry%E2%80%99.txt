‘We want to be end-to-end solution provider for SL telecom industry’

“I think right now the industry is going through a very interesting time,” said Suresh Sidhu, Chief Executive Officer of edotco Group, the first regional and integrated telecommunications infrastructure services company in Asia. “Slightly different impacts from country to country in the region, but overall I’d say the industry is in a good place. It has a huge opportunity coming up with 4G and 5G data. However, one concern is that the industry needs to realize that one size doesn’t fit all. You see a consistent theme across all countries in the Asian regions right now, but what works for one country may not work for another. I think a simple way to put it perhaps is that the industry needs to reshape itself to serving the future specific to the needs of the individual nation.”
Sidhu continues to speaks of the group’s projects in Sri Lanka.
Q: What do you see as some of the bottlenecks for the industry to reach the potential that it has?
A: I think the first thing is to have an open eco-system approach to doing things. The industry still likes to do everything themselves, whether it’s a question of partnerships, or the question of what they do or what they outsource. The most important thing the industry has to change is its mindset.
Today I think if you ask the average consumer of mobile telephony it’s not uncommon to find people saying I think my mobile provider is Google or Facebook. I think for the operator to be relevant they’re going to have to take digital very seriously. This is the first mindset change.
I think the second mindset change has to be partnerships. If you have to do everything by yourself should you not be partnering more extensively and this is where something like edotco I think would be a real benefit to the operator. You can spend your time much more effectively on transforming to a digital company if you outsource with the right partners.
Q: What kind of impact has edotco created regionally coming in as a partner to telecom networks?
A: There has been a lot of impact and we have seen different things in different countries. I think the first impact is we’ve managed to help a lot of our customers much faster than before. The reason for that is just that we’re specialized and focused on what we do. The second part is actually something perhaps which happened today in Colombo, innovation.
We’ve also driven the fact that “just because a tower is called a tower it doesn’t has to look like a tower”. Whether lamp poles or whether it’s a water tank or it’s even minarets in Malaysia, I think there’s an ability to innovate. The third one is that we take our job of operating towers very seriously.
In our country the big issue is energy and up time and all our countries in the Asian regions tend to suffer from problems with power fluctuations, etc. And there’s a lot of inefficiency in how energy is used. I think edotco has probably reduced energy costs for all of our customers by at least 10% over the last year and that’s a big number. That doesn’t come from doing any one thing but is a result of doing a few small things.
Q: What are your views on the telecommunication industry in Sri Lanka after the research that you’ve done and also in comparison to some of our neighbors, how do you see the industry here?
A: It’s a very very interesting country for a telecommunication industry and you have very sophisticated customer base in the urban centers like in Colombo. In many ways it’s also on par with the customer base in Malaysia or Singapore. The big challenge for the industry here is that price point is extremely low. It’s great for customers but not so good for operators. So I think operators need to be more innovative. I believe they are all very open to thinking outside the box about these things. A customer’s digital experience should be great. And I think that’s what Sri Lankan operators need to focus more. I think the operators need to build the eco-system that has more power and stronger corporation among them.
Q: We have about 7,000 towers at the moment in Sri Lanka shared among different networks. What is edotco’s roll out plan to increase it to the capacity that we need right now?
A: I think we need to do couple of things for that. We need to of course make sure the industry coordinates and works together. Hopefully they will partner with us saving time and resources for everyone. I think we should also move to other areas like hosting.
Q: If you can just give us a little bit more information on the project that commenced today and the specifics of these lamp poles and what they are going to offering apart from being a connectivity tower?
A: I think the opportunity for communities, cities and countries as we move in to structures like lamp poles is going to be very interesting. Structures like lamp poles are not only meant for communications but also for other services there are relevant for all the communities. For example, the lamp post we are promoting can also be used for traffic management, weather management, safety and security. These solutions can also be used as digital advertising. We could provide a range of support services like emergency access services.
Q: What is the first phase of the project? Now I know Marine Drive is the location but how many lamp poles are we looking at? And what would be the completion date of this particular phase?
A: There would be no stop date because it depends on the demand from operators. When the requirement comes up we will keep on adding. So the start of the project would be based on the demand and we will just keep adding on to it.
Q: Have you identified other areas of Colombo as well?
A: We are looking all around the country. We believe the initial potential over two years is up to thousand of these types of multi-purpose poles in different locations across the country. We are first working with the RDA and we are looking for other partners to work with.
Q: Are these lamp poles going to be powered by solar power?
A: It will be in future. But right now it will be powered through the grid. Wherever we can bring the technology to power through solar obviously we are going to present cheaper solutions to our customers.
Q: What are edotco’s long-term plans and goals for Sri Lanka?
A: We want to be an end-to-end solution provider for the telecommunications industry. That will mostly be for the near term in this area of towers and poles. We are very committed and this business is what we call a “Forever Business”. We want to build a business that is sensitive to the country’s needs and supports national development of the country.
Q: What kind of job opportunities you are creating for Sri Lankans in terms of setting up operations here?
A: If you look at our own operation it’s an engineering centric organization where we need expertise in civil structure like engineering and energy. In terms of opportunities beyond our own company there will always be the labour force required to put up structures as well. We have also found that Sri Lanka possesses a wealth of energy engineers and some civil engineers who have the knowledge and expertise to work on our projects overseas in Malaysia, Bangladesh and Myanmar. A few of them are already working at these sites and we see great potential for many as our work continues in Sri Lanka and the region.
