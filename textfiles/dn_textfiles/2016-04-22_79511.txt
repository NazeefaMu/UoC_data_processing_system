Galle May Day rally will be harbinger of SLFP’s glory ahead: Shan

 
 The May Day rally of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party scheduled to be held in Galle will be a historic event with the participation of a massive crowd, Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal de Silva said.
“It would be the foremost volley that heralds the renewed glorious political journey towards remarkable victory of the party at the next parliamentary election,” he told a media conference about the SLFP May Day celebrations scheduled to be held in Galle. The people of the Southern Province are prominent in initiating revolutionary episodes that change the country’s political history. The people of the South were the forerunners who registered the first political victory in 1994 that led to the change of the 17 year suppressive regime that was in power since 1997. Hence the party decided to hold its 2016 May Day celebrations in Galle which would demonstrate the party men’s unity, solidarity and their resolute faith and love towards the party, de Silva said.
“We will defeat all subversive schemes of conspirators against the party. All faithful SLFP cadres are with the party and rally round President Maithripala Sirisena. There are a few who are knowingly plotting against the party aimed at fulfilling the needs of the conspirators against the party. We know that we cannot draw such sections to the right path for they are in a make-believe sleep. However real SLFP members who understand the destructive motives of plotters gradually rally round the party leadership,” he said.
The Chief Minister who enlightened the fate of dissidents of any party in the past affirmed that such nonconformists had to take three options.
“They had either to rejoin the party after some time or join another party and some had to retire from politics for ever. So we trust that some of our party men who are misled by conspirators against the party will rejoin the party after they understand the real malicious drives of them,” de Silva said.
“A party or any organisation should have only one leader and the members have to respect that leadership. We as dedicated SLFPers have always been loyal to the party leader. I have never seen S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, the founder leader of the party or heard his voice for real. But we all respect him,” the Chief Minister said.
Commenting on the moves by the Joint Opposition to hold a May Day rally, de Silva challenged them to have such demonstration without the participation of SLFP members.
“There are a few minor political parties which are limited only to party name boards,” he said.
“All such parties are politically destitute. They have no party cadres of their own. As such, they try to divide our party and celebrate May Day with our people. I challenge them to organise a May Day rally without our people and solely with their members. I urge party men not to be misled by the false propaganda of schemers and to stand for party unity,” he said.
President Maithripala Sirisena wants to unite all sections of the party. He will not advocate any move that would lead for a division in the party. Loyalty towards the party is to be with the party leader. To be with the party leader is not an offence. It is a grievous fault to go against the party leader, the Chief Minister said.
Provincial Minister U.G.D. Ariyathilake said it was ridiculous to note that some extremist chauvinistic forces were planning to hold a May Day rally at Kirullapone.
“The Kirullapone May Day rally is organised by members of some seven marginal parties who claim to be the so called joint opposition. The SLFP’s May Day rally will be held in Galle. All SLFP members should attend the Galle May Day celebrations,” he said. Provincial Minister Chandima Rasaputra said they would not allow anyone to destroy the unity of the party and urged all members of the SLFP to join the May Day rally in Galle.
