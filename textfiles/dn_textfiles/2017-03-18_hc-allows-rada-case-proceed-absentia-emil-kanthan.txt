HC allows RADA case to proceed in absentia of Emil Kanthan

 The Colombo High Court yesterday allowed the Attorney General to proceed with the controversial RADA case in absentia of former North and Eastern Provinces LTTE Financial Head Emil Kanthan in connection with a Rs.200 million fraud that had allegedly taken place at the RADA in 2006.
High Court Judge Vikum Kaluarachchi made this order in terms of Section 241 of the Criminal Procedure Code following the Attorney General’s position that the police Special Investigation Unit (SIU) failed to execute the open warrant issued for the arrest of Emil Kanthan. Several witnesses were testified in Court in order to lead evidence in absentia of Emil Kanthan.
The case was fixed for a calling date on May 23.
The Attorney General had filed criminal proceedings against four accused-former Chairman of RADA Tiran Alles, former North and Eastern Provinces LTTE Financial Head Emil Kanthan, former Chief Operating Officer (COO) of RADA Saliya Wickramasuriya and Dr. Jayantha Dias Samarasinghe in connection with controversial RADA fraud. On October 18, 2016, the Supreme Court had pronounced that the Attorney General has no obstacle to file indictments against Tiran Alles in the High Court and observed that the Interim Order issued by Supreme Court did not bar the Attorney General filing indictments against the petitioner (Tiran Alles) based on the findings of the investigation into the incident.The second accused Emil Kanthan is currently evading courts and the Colombo Special High Court had also issued an open warrant for his arrest, in connection with attempted murder of former Minister Douglas Devananda.
Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda PC with Senior State Counsel Lakmini Giragamage and State Counsel Udara Karunatilleke appeared for the Attorney General. President’s Counsel Nalin Ladduwahetty appeared for first accused Tiran Alles. President’s Counsel Shanaka Ranasinghe appeared for Emil Kanthan.
