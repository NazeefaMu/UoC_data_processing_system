JVP leader attempting to re-direct the mud thrown at him: Harin

 
 JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake was slinging mud at the UNP as a diversionary tactic to escape the mud thrown at him by others, Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando said.
He made this observation at a media conference held at Sirikotha yesterday.
Minister Fernando totally refuted the recent allegations made by JVP Leader Parliamentarian Anura Kumara Dissanyake claiming that in the Supplementary Estimate presented by the Government there were allocations of Rs 600 million to purchase VIP
vehicles for the Prime Minister, another Rs 60 million for the renovation of Minister Kabir Hashim’s Ministry office and another Rs 4.8 million for the renovation of the Telecommunication Minister’s official residence.
Minister Fernando said that even the Prime Minister is still unaware that he has ordered two vehicles for his personal use and this request has been made by the Prime Minister Security Division (PMSD) through a procurement committee, since the official vehicle currently used by the Prime Minister is over 10 years old. Therefore, the monthly maintenance charge is over Rs.500,000.
“The PMSD has requested two bullet proof vehicles worth Rs 128 million.
“But, it is necessary to pay Rs.448 million in tax to the government. This is a tax paid by the government to the government,” the minister said.
He further said that Cabinet approval has been granted to allocate Rs.60 million to shift Minister Kabir Hashim’s Ministry to the World Trade Centre, since a large number of institutions such as banks, the BOI come under his ministry and the WTC is a more convenient place for him to handle all these institutions. But, only Rs.30 million has been spent for this purpose by saving 50 percent of the funds allocated for that.
Minister Fernando also said that according to the government’s estimate, it is necessary to have Rs. 2.7 million for the renovation of the official residence of the Minister of Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure. “But, the government has granted only Rs. 4.1 million,” he said.
“The official residence is a state property and not a personal property of mine.”the minister added.
