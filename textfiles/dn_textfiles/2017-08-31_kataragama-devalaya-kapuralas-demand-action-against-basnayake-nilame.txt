Kataragama Devalaya Kapuralas demand action against Basnayake Nilame

A group of Kapuralas (officiating priests) attached to the Ruhunu Maha Kataragama Devalapaya, have sent a petition to the IGP, Buddhist Affairs Commissioner and several other parties, requesting them to initiate an investigation against the incumbent Basnayake Nilame of the Devalaya who, they allege, is engaged in severe misappropriation of Devalaya funds.
Chief officiating priest Somipala T. Ratnayake addressing the media alleged that when devotees are supplying all provisions for the Devadana and other poojas, including rice and vegetable, the Basnayake Nilake is charging Rs. 12,500 from devotees ostensibly for the deva danaya and pocketing the money.
He said all expenditure of the Devalaya, including water and electricity bills are borne by the State. He said the Basnayake Nilame had obtained a Bank loan to build a Vishrama sala (Rest hall) when the building was put up by the Army with material supplied by the devotees.
Lal Rajapaksa, a priest officiating in thevava ceremonies alleged that the present Basnayake Nilame is the most corrupt Basnayake Nilame among the long line of persons who held the post.
He said the Basnayake Nilame had collected money from sponsors to erect silver pillars at the Devalaya saying a pillar cost Rs. 1.7 million each, but erected silver plated pillars instead and played out the balance money. He said a large section of funds collected for the Perahera too had gone missing.
However, Basnayake Nilame D. P. Kurunegala when contracted dismissed the allegations as baseless. He said all income and expenditure had been accounted and documented in a transparent manner. He said he is prepared for any audit inspection.
