Are potatoes good for you ?

There’s no vegetable quite as versatile as the humble potato. Roasted. Mashed. Boiled. Fried. And that’s before you get onto sweet potatoes and the various foods you can make with them both, like farls, dauphinoise, rostis, crisps…
Every version is delicious and every version tastes completely different. And considering that about 40 percent of the Irish population used to be solely reliant on potatoes before the famine, it’d follow that it is possible to live off them.
What nutrients do potatoes contain?
Regular potatoes are actually pretty nutrition-dense. They’re a good source of vitamin B6 (essential for maintaining a healthy nervous system) and potassium (helps maintain consistent blood pressure), as well as copper (helps with energy), vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, fibre and pantothenic acid – all crucial minerals and vitamins.
Sweet potatoes are super rich in vitamin A (a powerful antioxidant and a crucial nutrient for eyes, health, skin and brain function), vitamin B 1, 2 and 6, vitamin C, manganese, copper, pantothenic acid, potassium and fibre.
Are they all contained in the skin?
The skin is super-nutrient dense…but so is the flesh. They just contain different quantities of different nutrients. The skin of a baked potato, for example, contains around 115 and 27g of carbohydrates, while the flesh contains 145 calories and 34g of carbs. A whole baked potato has 66 percent of the recommended daily intake of vitamin B6, 31 percent of vitamin C and 19 percent of thiamin. The flesh contributes up to 70 percent of the total amount of all three.
The skin, meanwhile, is a rich source of iron (around 60 percent of the total).
Both are nutritious, it’s just that if you consider an equal amount of flesh and skin, you’ll find that the skin is more nutritionally dense. 100g of skins (around two potatoes) would contain five times more riboflavin, seven times the calcium, and 17 times more iron than the same amount of flesh. So if you keep binning the skin, you really are missing a trick.
Can you count them as part of your five-a-day?
Despite being so rich in so many vitamins and minerals, potatoes don’t actually count towards one of your five-a-day.
In fact, according to the NHS, neither do most starchy foods. Yams, cassava and plantain also don’t count, and that’s because they mainly contribute starch to our diet – they’re there to fill us up.
How many calories does a potato contain?
One medium sized potato contains 110 calories, while one medium sweet potato weighs in at 180 calories. But that difference in calories doen’t have anything to do with how ‘healthy’ either are; in fact, sweet potatoes are often touted as the more nutritious option.
Are they healthy?
It depends on how they’re cooked. Both types of potato contain health-giving properties but if you’re going to deep fry them before emptying half a salt cellar on them or smothering them in mayo, you’re probably negating a lot of the benefits.
Chips contain around 312 calories and around 35g of fat per 100g; they’re delicious and good for the soul but no one seriously believes that they’re actively healthy.
White potatoes also have a high glycemic index, which means that they can cause our blood sugar levels to rapidly rise. We do actually need high GI foods in our diet (for instant energy) but you want to make sure that the majority of your carbs are low-GI.
Weirdly enough, sweet potatoes are naturally low-GI but become super high-GI when baked. So if you want to keep your sugar levels lower, boil them. Cooking them in the oven or pan essentially turn them into nature’s candy (which is why sweet potato fries are so delicious). Metro
