ICSA The Governance Institute back in Sri Lanka

The re-launch of the branch of ICSA in Sri Lanka took place with the arrival of Theresa Minnie, Head of Outreach, ICSA, The Governance Institute, recently.
A member of the UKRIAT Committee in the UK Bentley Barsenbach, handed over a copy of the branch status in the presence of the ICSA members, at a members meeting held on July 25 at ‘Sundowner’, Colombo Swimming Club, Colombo.
ICSA, The Governance Institute paves the way for a UK qualification for those who are interested in pursuing as a Chartered Governance Professional or a Chartered Company Secretary.
This qualification is recognized worldwide. Minnie spoke to the members about the changes in the qualification and the exemptions offered for those with relevant degrees. Qualifying as a Governance Professional will identify you as having the knowledge and skill that are highly valued in the UK and around the world. Being professionally qualified through ICSA shows you understand how law, finance and governance operate in an organization, for career opportunities in many different sectors and roles.
The ICSA Governance Institute has been in existence for the past 127 years and bestows a world recognized Chartered Qualification.
