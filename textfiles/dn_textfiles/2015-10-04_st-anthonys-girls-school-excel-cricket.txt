St. Anthony's Girls School excel in cricket

St. Anthony's Girls School, Kandy did creditably well at the Provincial Cricket Tournament organized by the Dept. of Education, Kandy recently.
The team is coached by former Anthonian Cricketer Susantha Basnayake who has trained them well to be selected to represent the all island cricket tournament to be held in October at Sri Sumangala Boys School Grounds Panadura.
It is the only girls Cricket team from Kandy.
The team is encouraged by the sports loving Principal of St. Anthony's Girls School, Pathma Lekamge and teacher-in-charge Wasanthi Jinadasa.
