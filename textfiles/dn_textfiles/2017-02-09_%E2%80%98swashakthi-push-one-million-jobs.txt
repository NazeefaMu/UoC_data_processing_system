“The foundation for the development of a country is the development of the economy at village level with the utilisation of resources in the villages,”he added.
Referring to the funding of the ‘Swashakthi’ loan scheme,the Prime Minister said, “Rs. 1 Billion has being allocated by the Treasury as the initial fund allocation for the ‘Swashakthi’ loan scheme. “It will eventually be enhanced to Rs.4 Billion. We are anticipating that with the contribution of the banks, the fund will increase up to around Rs. 12 Billion. Also the deviations of the scheme will be identified and amended with the execution of the scheme in order to provide a better service,”the Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
The Premier also said that economic growth would be increased with the implementation of the loan scheme which will boost the country’s middle class.
Central Bank Governor Dr.Indrajith Coomaraswamy said a minimum of 75 start ups at each village would be expected with the new loan scheme developed by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) jointly with the National Policies and Economic Affairs Ministry.
Dr.Coomaraswamy further said ; “Under this loan scheme, start up businesses will be given a maximum of Rs.200,000 at a nominal interest rate of 5.5 percent.
In addition to the loan component, new entrants are eligible for a grant of Rs.50,000 to meet initial expenditure which will be provided without interest. Also existing businesses will receive a maximum loan of Rs.250,000 at an interest rate of 5.5 percent.
The beneficiaries have an opportunity to repay the loan within a period of 5 years including a maximum grace period of 12 months”.
He also said that the CBSL had contributed a comprehensive amount of USD 79.5 Billion for various loans for Small and Medium scale enterprises over the past five years.
“The main objective of CBSL granting loans is to eradicate poverty and contribute towards the country’s economic growth,” Dr.Coomaraswamy added.
Dr.Coomaraswamy instructed the 17 participating banks to assess the viability and strength of the project plans when granting loans rather than only assessing the strengths.
