Chinese delegation visits Sri Lanka

President of the Sri Lanka – China Friendship Association (SLCFA), Attorney-at-Law Ananda Goonatilleke, welcomed the visiting Chinese delegation headed by a high ranking officer of the General Office of Communist Party of China (CPC) Liu Hongcai. He had held important positions of the International Department of the Central Committee (IDCPC) for about 40 years from 1975.
During this long period he served as the Director- General, Secretary-General and Vice Minister of the CPC International Department. As he was in charge of Asian Affairs, his present visit signifies special importance to Sri Lanka – China political relations. He is scheduled to meet Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, the General Secretary of Sri Lanka Freedom Party, Duminda Dissanayake and the Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala.
Liu Hongcai is a scholar of the Beijing International Studies University, who served as the First Secretary of the Chinese Embassy in Japan and also as the Chinese Ambassador to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. This is his first visit to Sri Lanka and he arrives as the Vice President of the Chinese Association for International Understanding (CAFIU). The CAFIU is the NGO that represents the CPC International Department and is directly involved in activities of UN ECOSOC with special consultative status. Sri Lanka – China Friendship Association had signed a Memorandum of Understanding with CAFIU in 2013, and had worked with CAFIU both in Sri Lanka and China. “Maritime Silk Road” speech contest among 575 Sri Lankan students held in 2015 highlights those joint projects.
