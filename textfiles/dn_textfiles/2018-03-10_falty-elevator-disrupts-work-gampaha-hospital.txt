Falty elevator disrupts work at Gampaha Hospital

Doctors and the nursing staff at Gampaha Hospital staged a protest yesterday mentioning that the hospital had become an insecure place for them due to the falty elevator.
They said the hospital elevator is malfunctioning regularly due to power cuts happening frequently with accidents occurring due to this.
A person died last Thursday in his attempt to jump out from the elevator when he was stuck between two floors due to a power cut.The doctors and nursing staff said there were several incidents where the doctors and the nursing staff too were stuck in the same elevator due to power failures.
Doctors and the nursing staff had taken a decision not to register new patients to the Gampaha hospital till the relevant authorities take action.
