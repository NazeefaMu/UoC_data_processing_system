Unions to file FR against Education Minister

 
The Collective of Unions for Protecting Education will file a Fundamental Rights petition in the Supreme Court on the alleged granting of appointments and promotions on political grounds by Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam to several persons who have not passed the Sri Lanka Education Administrative Service, Teachers’ Service, Principal service and Teacher Educator’s Service exams on the pretext that they have been politically victimised.
Sri Lanka Education Administrative Service (SLEAS) Union Media Spokesman Neil Athukorala addressing the media yesterday in Colombo, said this is totally against the Constitution on the Education Administrative Service.
“The Public Administration and Home Affairs Ministry has already sent a list of 4,500 names to the Education Ministry and if this done in a transparent manner, we urge the minister to publish these names on the ministry website. We have held a protest campaign against this move opposite the Education Ministry recently but Minister Kariyawasam said this is a sabotage action of the Joint Opposition. This is being done while moves are on the way to select the qualified candidates to the education sector after the competitive examination this year,” he said.
Civil Society Activist Dr. Nirmal Ranjith Dewasiri said it is regrettable that the government service is being used for political purposes. Education will suffer a setback when unqualified persons are recruited to the education service in the guise of redressing political victimisation. If there are political victimised persons, proper investigation should be held and solutions found without resorting to actions like this. Usually, only highly qualified people who have passed interviews conducted by the Public Service Commission are recruited to the education administrative service, teaching service and principal service.
Most in the list have been interdicted as they have engaged in fraudulent acts, political canvassing and some anti-social activities during working hours. Among them are many who have not passed the relevant exams as well, he said.
If the Education Minister is not doing anything wrong, he should come for an open debate and clarify the issue, Dr. Dewasiri said.
