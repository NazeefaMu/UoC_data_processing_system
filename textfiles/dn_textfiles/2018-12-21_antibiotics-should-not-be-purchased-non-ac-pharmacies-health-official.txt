Antibiotics should not be purchased from non AC pharmacies - Health Official

The public should not purchase antibiotics from the non-air-conditioned pharmacies, which could damage the effectiveness of those drugs, Laboratory Services Deputy Director General Dr. H.Benaragama said.
He said maintaining the required temperature for drugs in pharmacies is essential to protect the effective time duration of these drugs.
Dr. Benaragama stated this addressing the ‘Symposium on Containment of Antimicrobial Resistance and Infection Prevention and Control’ held at the Galle Face Hotel yesterday.
He said the antibiotic drugs are being misused heavily at present.Therefore, the pharmacists should dispense these drugs to the patience only on a prescription issued by a western-qualified doctor, he emphasised.
Dr.Benaragama said patients should complete the full dose of the anti-biotic drugs prescribed by a qualified doctor; otherwise it could be cause for antimicrobial resistances.
According to him, some doctors, not only in private practice but, government medical officers prescribe antibiotics unnecessarily to the patients. He also pointed out that the doctors of the other medical practices such as the Ayurvedic and the Homeopathy and also the quacks prescribe these antibiotics without a proper knowledge or authority. These things could result in Antimicrobial Resistances (AMRs), Dr.Benaragama said.
Health Services Director General Dr. Anil Jasinghe said it has been estimated that antimicrobial resistances would cause for 10 million deaths globally by 2050.Antibiotics that save millions of lives in the world will become useless if it was misused or overused, Dr. Jasinghe pointed out.
He said antimicrobial resistance is on the rise in every region of the world. “The world is heading towards a post-antibiotic era. If the current trend continues, sophisticated interventions such as organ transplant, cancer chemotherapy and joint replacements would become more difficult or even more dangerous to undertake,” he emphasised.
Sri Lanka adopted the National Strategic Plan for Combating Antimicrobial Resistance in Sri Lanka 2017 - 2022 in May 2017.
Health, Nutrition, Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne was the chief guest.
