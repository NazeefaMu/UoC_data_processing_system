Kareena to star in a  woman-centric dark comedy?

After welcoming little Taimur Ali Khan, Kareena Kapoor Khan finally made her come back in films with Shashanka Ghosh’s ‘Veere Di Wedding’. Soon after ‘VDW’s super success at the box-office, Karan Johar announced Bebo in his next two films – period drama ‘Takht’ and ‘Good News’ opposite Akshay Kumar.
All this while, Kareena has been getting other film offers as well and the latest we hear is a dark comedy. On that, a source even informed a portal, “One of them is a dark comedy. The woman-centric drama is set in a small town in UP and Kareena’s role is that of a village belle.”
Now that Bebo is back from her exotic Maldives vacation, she will be given the narration of the film.
The source further added, “Kareena will decide once she hears the script. She will wrap up work on ‘Good News’ around March. Before ‘Takht’ takes off, she has a four-month break where she plans to schedule another movie. But as of now, she hasn’t signed anything else.”
