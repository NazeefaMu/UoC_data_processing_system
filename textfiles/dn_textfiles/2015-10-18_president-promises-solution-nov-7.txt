Prisoners detained under PTA
President promises solution before Nov. 7

President Maithripala Sirisena has promised to come up with a solution to the problems of prisoners detained under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) before November 7, National Dialogue Minister Mano Ganesan said.
He said the hunger strike that commenced on Monday by the prisoners detained under the PTA was called off on Saturday following the President’s and the Prime Minister’s assurance that their grievances would be looked in. Ganesan said the President during the Cabinet meeting asked Justice Minister Wijayadasa Rajapakshe, Law and Order and Prison Reforms Minister Thilak Marapana and himself to look into the matters of these prisoners.
He added Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe asked them to discuss with the Attorney General to find a solution. Ganesan noted they would apprise the Cabinet once again of the developments of these discussions. We are of the opinion they should either be given bail or General Amnesty. The JVP rebels were granted general amnesty in 1971 and 1989. We want similar treatment to these political prisoners” Ganesan said. Prisons Commissioner General Rohana Pushpakumara, Opposition leader R. Sampanthan and TNA MP M. A. Sumanthiran visited the prisoners at the Magazine Prison in Colombo on Saturday to communicate to them the President’s decision to form a mechanism to look into their issues and come up with the solution by November 7.

The government should treat every prisoner equally. “If the administration succumbs to pressures of the prisoners,
we would not be able to manage the prisons,” UPFA MP and Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Leader Udaya Gammanpila said.
Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, he said the President was duty bound to explain the reasons for his special treatment for prisoners under the PTA.
