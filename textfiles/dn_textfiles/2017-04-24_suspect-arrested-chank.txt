Suspect arrested with chank

A suspect transporting 204 species of chank in a three-wheeler was arrested by Kalpitiya Police along the road lining the Kudawa lagoon in Kalpitiya on April 23.
Kalpitiya Police said possession, transport and sale of chank are prohibited under the Fisheries and Water Resources Act. Racketeers smuggle out chank to India for the production of ornaments which are in high demand in countries such as Thailand, Maldives and Bangladesh.
The suspect was due to be produced before the Puttalam Magistrate.
