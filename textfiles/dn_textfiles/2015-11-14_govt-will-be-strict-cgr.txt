'Govt will be strict on CGR'

The Railway Department is running at an annual loss of Rs. 3 billion. If the situation is confounded by problems relating to Trade Union issues, the government may be compelled to lose its attention on the Railway Department which may even lead to the transformation of the Railway Department into an authority, said Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva.
The minister was addressing a meeting attended by delegates of railway unions at the ministry on Thursday.
He said railway employees should not lead themselves into such a predicament by persisting and quarreling with trade union issues. The minister said there were nearly 100 old trade unions in the Railway Department.
They had different and divergent demands.
