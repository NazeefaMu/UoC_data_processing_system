Two die in jumbo attack

Two friends riding a motorcycle died after being attacked by a wild elephant at Lihinipitiya in Andawala, Matale around 7.30 pm on June 20.
They were on their way back home after delivering a message to a tractor driver to plough their paddy field the next morning, when tragedy struck them near a jungle area close to their field.
Naula Police said they recovered the bodies the following morning (21).
The victims were identified as Nalaka Ruwan Kumara, 29, a father of two and Kamal B. Herath, 30, a father of one.
The Magisterial inquiry into the deaths was due to be held yesterday. When Naula Divisional Secretary Athma Jayaratne visited the scene, the villagers requested her to ensure that protection is given to the village against marauding elephants until at least the funeral ceremonies of the two victims were concluded.
