Rakna Lanka to appeal against order to pay Rs. 840 m. to Avant Garde

The Rakna Lanka Security firm is reported to have engaged Arul Chaw and partners, a legal firm in Singapore to appeal against an order issued to it by the SIAC, a commercial arbitration council in Singapore, to pay a sum of Rs 840 million to the Avant Garde Maritime Security firm.
Attorney Chandana Jayasundera has been appointed by Rakna Lanka to co-ordinate matters concerning this appeal with Arul Chaw and partners.
Reports said the Singapore law firm had quoted 20,000 Singapore dollars as it’s charges to appear in this case in an agreement signed with Rakna Lanka Ltd. But, later it had increased its charges to 30,000 Singapore Dollars. Rakna Lanka is reported to have agreed to this increased amount.
A highly placed officer at Rakna Lanka Limited said the Arbitration Board had given the earlier decision as Rakna Lanka had failed to retain any lawyers during the initial hearing of the case. This lapse had occurred due to the negligence on the part of two of its former high officials.
