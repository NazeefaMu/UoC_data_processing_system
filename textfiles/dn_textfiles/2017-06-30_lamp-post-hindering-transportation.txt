Lamp post hindering transportation

The lamp post situated in the middle of Thalawitiya - Amuhenkanda Road has become a hindrance for schoolchildren and residents who pass the spot.
Amuhenkanda Rural Development Society widened the road a few months ago. As a result, the lamp post was positioned in the middle of the road.
This by-road stretches via Amuhenkanda Sri Wimalaramaya Temple and Amuhenkanda Wimalasara Vidyalaya.
Vehicles that transport schoolchildren travel along this road daily.
Teachers, parents and the public urge authorities to take immediate steps to remedy the situation.
