Bank guard shoots himself in the leg

A security guard attached to a National Savings Bank branch in Ingiriya, had accidentally shot himself in the leg in a bizarre incident yesterday.
“Bank guards carry loaded guns. The shot fired by it had injured the handler of the gun at about 9.45 am,” a Police officer said.
“The guard was rushed to the Ayagama Hospital and later transferred to the Ratnapura Hospital,” he said. “The patient’s condition however, was not serious,” he added.
