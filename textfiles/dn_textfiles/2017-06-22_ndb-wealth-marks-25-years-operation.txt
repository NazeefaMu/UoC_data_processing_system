NDB Wealth marks 25 years in operation

Financial planner NDB Wealth recently marked 25 years in operation with a simple, celebration for staff. This follows NDB Wealth's mid-June 2017 relocation to a spacious purpose-built “Private Wealth Management” centre, to enable future growth for the company.
A visit to Sri Lanka's first one-stop “Private Wealth Management” centre allows NDB Wealth clients to access a full range of financial products and services. Further, it is backed by support from a dedicated team comprising over 200 financial planning experts.
Since its beginnings as Eagle NDB Wealth Management, in June 1992, NDB Wealth has distinguished itself through an unprecedented track record of success, leading to growth having occurred virtually every year.
This has enabled NDB Wealth to maintain its coveted position as an industry leader almost from the beginning.
At the same time, NDB Wealth has been repeatedly lauded by Global Banking and Financial Review.
Most recently, in 2016, the magazine recognized NDB Wealth as the “Best Asset Management Company, Sri Lanka 2015”, for its expertise in the Asset and Wealth Management sub-sectors of the local Financial Services industry. This was the second consecutive year that NDB Wealth won this prestigious honor.
Additionally, NDB Wealth further separates itself from the pack by providing end-to-end, research-driven solutions for Institutions and high net worth Private Wealth clients.
Commenting, NDB Wealth CEO Prabodha Samarasekera said, “For a quarter century, the exemplary financial planning culture that is the cornerstone of NDB Wealth has allowed us to stay at the forefront of the local wealth management industry. Our work, even after 25 years, continues to be important to our country, helping Sri Lankan companies and citizens secure their financial futures. Going forward, we will be stepping up our efforts to make financial planning more accessible and understandable, particularly for everyday Sri Lankans.”
