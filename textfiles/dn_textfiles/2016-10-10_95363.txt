SL ‘’A’’ record a comfortable win as Dimuth returns to form with bat

Sri Lanka ‘’A’’ beat the touring West Indies ‘’A’’ team by 7 wickets in the 1st unofficial 3 match test series concluded at the R Premadasa stadium.
Dimuth Karunaratne Sri Lanka’s regular opening bat, captaining the ‘’A’’ team returned to form with the bat after his forgettable series against Australia. The left hander top scored with a stylish 131 in the first innings adding a valuable 161 run partnership with Kusal Perera who made 87.
Sri Lanka made 386 in their first innings in reply to the 276 made by West Indies establishing a healthy lead of 110 runs.
West Indies unfolded for a below par 175 in the second innings as they couldn’t cope up the pressure of handling the Lankan spinners. Lakshan Sandakan who recently debuted for Sri Lanka bagged 4 scalps whilst Asela Gunaratne and Charith Asalanka chipped in with 2 wickets each.
Sri Lanka reached their target of 66 in 20.3 losing 3 wickets. Notably Lahiru Thirimanne who was a regular in the national setup few month back failed to impress with the bat whilst Army SC’s Asela Gunaratne made useful contributions with both bat and ball.
Rahkeem Cornwall stood out for the West Indies with a match bag of 9 wickets with his off spinners.
The 2nd unofficial test will be worked out at the Pallekelle stadium on Tuesday the 11th October.
