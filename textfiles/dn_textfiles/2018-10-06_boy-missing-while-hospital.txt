Boy missing while at hospital

A boy, 11, residing at Medirigirya Yaya 7, Biso Bandaragama was reported missing after he came with his mother to receive treatment at the Polonnaruwa General Hospital on September 15.
The child and his mother had been in the queue at the Out Patients' Department. The boy had told his mother that he wanted to use the washroom and had left. Her mother, Kusuma Jayanthi said her child did not return thereafter. She had later complained to the hospital police and Polonnaruwa Police.
“Nineteen days have elapsed since my son’s disappearance. He was suffering from a heart ailment and he received treatment from Medirigiriya hospital,” Jayanthi said. She added that she had a suspicion that his uncle could have taken the boy.
