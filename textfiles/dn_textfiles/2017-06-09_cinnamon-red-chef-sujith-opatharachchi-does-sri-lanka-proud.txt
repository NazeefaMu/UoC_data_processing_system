Cinnamon Red Chef Sujith Opatharachchi does Sri Lanka proud

Young, passionate and driven, Chef Sujith Opatharachchi is one of the many rising stars at Colombo’s lean luxury hotel, Cinnamon Red. Having joined the team as a junior sous chef, he has shown exceptional skill and dedication in his work at the Hotel and has brought glory to Sri Lanka at the recently concluded International East Coast Salon Culinaire and Cocktails Competition held in the UAE.
Orgnaised by the Emirates Culinary Guild, the competition is a series of practical and display-based culinary challenges intended to test the differing skills of preparation and presentation of food and its accoutrements in attractive and pleasing forms. Opatharachchi competed in three categories of which he won bronze medals for all.
“I competed in the Three Course Gourmet Dinner Menu, Beef Practical Cookery and Chicken Practical Cookery,” Opatharachchi stated in a press release issued by Cinnamon Red. “It was tough competing with some of the best in the world. The judges look at all the details, from the point of planning to the final outcome.”
He contended with over 500 competitors from top international hotel chains including some 200 Sri Lankan chefs now residing in the gulf. However it was only him and another representing Sri Lanka at the event.
With multiple wins at the Chefs Guild Competition from 2011 onwards, this was his first international win. Speaking on what he made, Opatharachchi explained that for the Three Course Gourmet Set Menu he cooked smoked quail breast stuffed with vegetables, chicken lollipop and pomegranate gam, foie gra stuffed marinated duck breast, olive and polenta crusted veal loin, ivory coast chocolate cigar and, strawberry macaroons and coconut volcano. For the Beef Practical Cookery he created a olive crusted marinated beef rump along with cauliflower couscous and pumpkin cake and chicken leg quarter stuffed foie gra accompanied with edamame, stuffed leak bud and roasted onion with chicken casserole for Chicken Practical Cookery.
