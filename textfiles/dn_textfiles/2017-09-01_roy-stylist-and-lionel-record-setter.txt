ROY a stylist and LIONEL a record setter

Two batsmen who were made in the mould of West Indian maulers. And when at the wicket they sprayed bowlers around the world and over it with superb timing, power and elegance. They were two of kind : LIONEL FERNANDO in the pre Test era and ROY LUKE DIAS in the post Test era.
Both FERNANDO and DIAS were exciting to watch when in the hunt for runs. And there was a lot to learn watching them, the manner in which they pierced the field and left the fielders beaten as they caressed the ball to the fence with ease.
FERNANDO emerged from St Anne’s College Kurunegala to St.Benedict’s College, Kotahena and DIAS was a pure bred batsman from the School by the canal, St.Peter’s College Bambalapitiya. Both captained their respective schools, shone with the bat, scoring heavily and then continued to give continuity to their careers which culminated in playing for the country.
A little anecdote
Talking of the canal by the Bambalaptiya school a little anecdote related by Carlton Seneviratne a former Peterite cricketer and athlete and Sports Editor of the ‘DAILY NEWS. It went like this. He said: ‘Every time an athletic meet was held on the Peterite Ground, records used to tumble especially in the track events. When queried he said: ‘Because athletes were dashing away from the stench emanating from the canal’, to much laughter.
First to DIAS. He started his career which showed great promise under the expert coaching of former Peterite cricketer Mike Chanmugam. Chanmugam noticed in Dias the enormous natural talent and all he had to do was to talk to the young man, make him believe in his natural talent and only polish the rough edges in his batting. Chanmugam did that to a nicety.
One match DIAS won’t forget was the ‘Big match’ against St.Joseph’s when the side he captained collapsed for 36 unable to counter the amazing and well controlled seam and swing bowling by Josephian South Paw Rajiv Benedict.
That bowling feat of 8 for 6 will not be equaled or bettered. He was on a hat trick but young Bernard Wijetunge coming in next who was later to captain St.Peter’s deprived him of that rare feat.
Big runs for school
DIAS scored big runs for his school, captaining it and then threw his talent with the Colts Cricket Club where his coach Chanmugam was a member. He continued his run making in the Sara Trophy tournament and national colours were not long in coming. When the country rejoiced after gaining that elusive admission to the big league and when the inaugural Test against England was played at the Colombo Oval, DIAS found himself in the Sri Lanka team and penciled to bat at the fall-important number three slot.
But his first strike in the big time ended in disaster when he made a debut blob. Many top notch world batsmen have begun their career with ducks at the first time of striking and gone on to rewrite the batting record books. And it was no different with DIAS.
Style and elegance came naturally to DIAS. He was always in line with the ball and watched it hawk-eyed until the ball kissed his bat before executing the stroke that brought him bag full of runs in club as well as international cricket.
He was an example
He was an example to all youngsters watching and could be bracketed alongside Michael Tissera, Anura Tennekoon, Ranjan Madugalle, Sidat Wettimuny and Marvan Atapattu, Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara as batting stylists sadly not seen in today’s game.
Although DIAS made a disastrous debut first knock against England in the inaugural Test with a duck with a delivery from England pacie Bob Willis that was unplayable, he made the England players watch his elegant stroke play in the second innings making a grand 77 in this game where Duleep Mendis, Ranjan Madugalle and Arjuna Ranatunga also made half centuries.
In the Tests to follow h formed the Lankan batting backbone with his skipper Duleep Mendis, like did Michael Tissera and Anura Tennekoon, Asanka Gurusinha and Aravinda de Silva, Mahela Jayawardena and Kumar Sangakkara. DIAS continued his good form scoring 295 runs in the series against Pakistan in Pakistan with 98 at Faisalabad and a magnificent 109 at Lahore against an attack led by that once in a life time all rounder and a master of swing bowling Imran Khan.
Marvelous century
I was there on that tour as a journalist and with commentator and journalist Qamar Ahmed marveled at his century. Ahmed who had a score of covering cricket for over 50 years ( like the writer I might add) predicted a bright future for the youngster and DIAS strode the field scoring heavily and seeing Ahmed’s prediction come true.
DIAS played in 20 Tests scoring 1285 runs including three hundreds and 8 fifties with a highest score of 109. In the one-day career he played 58 matches, made 1573 runs including 2 centuries and 11 fifties. He began his Test career against England in 1982 and played the final Test against vs New Zealand in Colombo in 1987.
His one-day career unfolded against New Zealand at Nottingham in 1979 and ended against England in Pune in 1987. Incidentally ROY’s father RICHARD and brother NORMAN were Benedictines and played soccer for the college and RICHARD played for Ceylon later on.
Benedictine LIONEL FERNANDO
LIONEL FERNANDO was a heavy scoring stylish right hand batsman in school cricket for St.Benedict’s College, Kotahena in late 1950s. He was also a handy right arm bowler who bowled medium pace both way cutters.
He captained SBC in 1959 and I was his vice captain. In a game against his old school St.Anne’s he created a rare record that will probably stand the test of time.
On the first day he bagged all 10 wickets for 24 including a hat trick to dismiss the opponents for 50 and slammed a double hundred in 157 minutes on the turf wicket at Kotahena which was believed to be unique in world cricket and earned him mention in cricket’s bible – WISDEN.
FERNANDO later played for Nomads and earned his Ceylon cap and played from 1964 t 1971. He first played for the Board President’s X1 when Sri Lanka defeated Pakistan in 1964. He top scored with 40 in a one dayer for Ceylon against MCC.
He also toured Pakistan and played in an unofficial Test and a few days later made 48 and 72 against a strong West Indies side at the Colombo Oval.
FERNANDO later played league cricket in England before migrating to Australia where he continued his career where he played several season’s of club cricket.
ROY and LIONEL deserve to be in the list of SPORTS LEGENDS.
