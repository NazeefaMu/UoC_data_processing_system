Food for happiness

A wonderful attempt has been fulfilled in the collection of the teachings of the great Thai monk leader named Ajahn Chah (1918 – 1992) titled as ‘Food for the Heart’ (Wisdom, Boston 2002). Most teachings of Ajahn Chah had been lying scattered in various places, as recorded sermons, dialogues, discourses and essays so far not translated into English from Thai. The compilers responsible are Jack Kornfield (with a forward) and Ajahn Amaro (with an introduction to the collection of 38 teachings).
Some of the teachings are translated from the original Thai sources and some other culled from the already available sources and printed for free distribution from such places as Amaravati Forest Monastery in the UK and other venues all over the world.
The reader comes across various types of expressions of the great monk scholar inclusive of his parables, dialogues, epigrams and interpretations. For the sake of better classification and clarity, the compendium is subdivided into three broad headings.
1. Conduct: where the explanations on virtue and world senses are taken into consideration.
2. Meditation: where the theory of practice is explained.
3. Wisdom: on the path to the ultimate goal.
Kornfield says that it is hard to know how to best introduce the wisest man he has ever met. The person he refers to is Ajahn Chah in whose presence he believes was the utmost aliveness, tranquility, wisdom and simplicity, truth-telling, dignity and intimacy, humour and serious discipline, heart-breaking compassion and spontaneous freedom.
Perhaps the compilation is a result of contemplating on all these aspects. Kornfield believes that the entire life span led by Ajahn Chah was packed with the essence of teachings of the Buddha in the simplest form possible not only to the dispensation of monks but also to the laymen around the world.
In part one, dealing with the aspects of conduct, Ajahn Chah takes into conduct the broad titles like ‘Living in the world with Dhamma’, ‘Making the heart good’ and ‘Understanding the concept of Vinaya or discipline’. All these aspects are analysed and interpreted in the simplest possible means enabling the listener, or the reader, gripped into a single point.
In part two, the main topic of discussion is the theory and practice of meditation. As a starting point, Ajahn Chah explains why an inner peace is needed for a human being. He terms this as ‘inner balance’. Then he goes on to explain the various ways in which ‘mind’ could be trained to achieve a certain degree of happiness which under normal stress could never be gained. He maintains the idea that the mind full of fickle thought, untrained, begins to give way to undue unhappiness. As such, meditation has to be learned and practiced. He states that it is a key to liberation. Although the term ‘Mindfulness’ is used quite often in the modern context of living, it could never be achieved sans meditation.
In 16 segments, Ajahn explains the concept of wisdom. In the dialogue that is titled as ‘What is contemplation?’ the reader comes to know that wisdom is a state that lies beyond the plane of mere thinking, and gaining knowledge on various subjects. It is explained as the highest state of contemplation that surpasses Samadhi or concentration. He states that we use thinking as a tool, but the knowing that arises because of its use is above anything beyond the process of thinking, (for) it leads to our not being fooled by our thinking anymore. Then he says that you recognize that all thinking is merely the movement of the mind, and also that the knowing is not born and does not die; wisdom is achieved at a moment that cannot be explained by words.
In this manner, the state of the mind and its functions are xplaiend in the best possible manner. He goes to extent of supplementing with examples from the lives of those who attempted to train the mind for a purpose, devoid of mere use of words. The reader comes to feel that that practice is not just a matter of talking about mind, but a process of training.
The term, paccattam, is used in the context, for he says that the Dhamma is not understood because somebody else tells you about it, but you must see it for yourself. As a reader, I felt that the discourse that goes as the nature of Dhamma is packed with a greater vision than one could fathom. Ajahn says:
“Everything is Dhamma, not only the things we see, with our physical eye, but also the things we see in our mind.”
A thought arises, then changes and passes away. It is called Nama Dhamma, simply a mental impression that arises and passes away. He lays down several poetic phrases that go as the insight to the nature of Dhamma as follows.
Where is the Buddha? The Buddha is in the Dhamma.
Where is the Dhamma? The Dhamma is in the Buddha.
Right here, now!
Where is the Sangha?
The Sangha is in the Dhamma.”
He concludes that the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha exist in our minds. But he cautions that we have to see this clearly. Some people just say casually: ‘Oh the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha exist in my mind.” Yet their own practice is not in accord with the truth. It is thus not possible to find the Budhda, the Dhamma and the Sangha should be found in their minds, because the mind must first be that mind that knows what Dhamma is. Only then will we come to know that truth does exist in the world, and that it is possible for us to practice and thereby realize it. All in all not a single page is dull. Each sentence carries a sense of liveliness.
