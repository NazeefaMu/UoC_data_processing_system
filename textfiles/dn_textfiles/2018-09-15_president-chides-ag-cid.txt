Arrest of Military officers:
PRESIDENT CHIDES AG, CID

President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday revealed that he had severely admonished officials of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) and the Attorney General for constantly taking military officers into custody, remanding them for a short period and then releasing them, even though there had been no prosecutions so far.
Addressing newspaper editors and heads of media institutions at President’s House yesterday, President Sirisena said that since investigations began in 2015, not a single case had been filed against military suspects arrested in connection with the Lasantha Wickrematunge assassination case, the Prageeth Ekneligoda abduction case, the Keith Noyahr abduction and assault case and the abduction of 11 Tamil youth.
“I received a copy of the IGP’s latest progress report on these investigations into the attacks on journalists and so on, and I found that not a single prosecution had been filed so far since 2015,” he told editors at the breakfast meeting. “The former second in command of the Army was arrested and remanded for five months, but no case was filed,” the President added, referring to the former Director of the Directorate of Military Intelligence, Amal Karunasekera.
For weeks, there are reports about the Chief of Defence Staff facing allegations of harbouring a person involved in abducting 11 children, the President said. “The CID says they have all been taken into custody, but they have also been released on bail and there are no indictments served on them so far. And even though the suspects were in fact released on bail, the accusation against the Chief of Defence Staff is that he has prevented the arrest of a suspect,” President Sirisena added.
The President was referring to Admiral Ravindra Wijeguneratne whose arrest was said to be imminent after the CID told a Magistrate that he had been harbouring a suspect wanted in connection with the abduction and suspected murder of 11 Tamil youth in 2008-09.
President Sirisena told reporters that he had summoned the Attorney General, IGP and CID top brass for a meeting two days ago, and pitched into them about the failure to file cases against those being accused of these crimes. “I told them, don’t arrest and detain these people if you can’t file cases against them,” he said.
“The way things are being reported, the perception in the country is that the Chief of Defence staff killed these 11 children,” the President charged.
President Sirisena added that he had told the CID and the AG that they were arresting and remanding senior military officials for months and then releasing them, giving rise to an accusation against the Government that it was on a witch-hunt of war heroes.
Meanwhile, referring to the emergency Cabinet meeting called on Thursday (13), and reports that there had been major clashes at the meeting, President Sirisena quipped that Cabinet meetings were ‘highly democratic’ now.
“There is a great atmosphere of debate and discussion at Cabinet meetings now. There are strong exchanges of views, fierce debates and frank discussions. In no Government, I have been a part of have Cabinet meetings been like this,” he said.

Resolving post-war issues
President’s UNGA proposals to be presented at UNHRC in March 2019
Signalling that Sri Lanka may take a step back on commitments made in the 2015 UNHRC resolution in Geneva, President Maithripala Sirisena told media heads yesterday that he would submit a comprehensive set of fresh proposals aimed at resolving post-war issues, including the allegations of human rights violations against the Sri Lankan military and the demands for the release of LTTE suspects and convicts currently in custody by their families, to the UN General Assembly on September 25.
Responding to a question raised by a journalist, President Sirisena also announced that this proposal would be submitted in writing to the UN Secretary General António Guterres and new UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet.
At the UNGA, it will be a request he will be making on behalf of Sri Lanka he said.
“We are also hoping to present these proposals as a resolution to the UN Human Rights Council in March 2019,” the President added.
“There will be criticisms against these proposals from various quarters, but I have to think about the future of the country,” he explained. President Sirisena said that now that Sri Lanka had repaired relations with the UN and the international community, it was time for the conditions of the UNHRC resolution on the country to be “relaxed”. “This is what is necessary to ensure the independence, national security and dignity of our country,” he said.
