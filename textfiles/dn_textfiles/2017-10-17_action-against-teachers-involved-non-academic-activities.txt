Action against teachers involved  in non academic activities

Education Minister Akila viraj Kariyawasam yesterday said action would be taken against teachers who incite students against the government’s policy on teacher transfers.
The Minister added that the Ministry will take disciplinary action against teachers involved in such activities. He said he introduced a programme to effectively implement the transfer scheme.
“A teacher transfer scheme has not been in force for years,” the Minister said. Minister Kariyawasam said the ministry has received information that certain teachers were inciting teachers against the scheme. He said a new policy on transfers would be implemented once in every five year.
