Kiriella, Opposition Leader call to convene Parliament

UNP MP and former Public Enterprise Development Minister Lakshman Kiriella said the UNP has sent a written request to the Speaker asking him to convene parliament immediately.
Speaking at a media briefing yesterday he said that the Speaker has the right to convene parliament as he is above all in terms of positions.
“This decision by the President is against parliamentary tradition. In April Ranil Wickremesinghe defeated the no-confidence motion. Since April, there has been no change in the majority support.” He said.
He said the UNP had faith that they would be victorious. “The masses have accepted this decision as being unconstitutional. So we ask the Speaker to convene parliament immediately.”
Opposition Leader R.Sampanthan has also written to the Speaker calling him to convene parliament and uphold the rule of law. “I call upon yourself sir to summon parliament forthwith to enable parliament to perform its legitimate functions,"Sampanthan said.
