Illegally obtaining electricity: case against  former Litro Gas chairman

A case filed against former Litro Gas Chairman Shalila Moonasinghe for illegally obtaining electricity to his residence in Rajagiriya in 2014 was yesterday fixed for trial by the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s court.
In this case, Borella Police alleged that suspect Shalila Moonasinghe had illegally obtained electricity by tampering an electricity meter in 2014, causing a financial loss to the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB).
The Welikada Police along with the CEB had carried out a raid over a complaint that Shalila Moonasinghe had allegedly tampered with an electricity meter in order to obtain electricity by illegal means.
When the case came up before Colombo Additional Magistrate Buddhika Sri Ragala, the witnesses in the case were noticed to appear in court on February 19 next year. Former Litro Gas Chairman Shalila Moonasinghe is currently in remand custody in connection with the alleged transferring of USD 1.1 million from Far Eastern International Bank of Taiwan to his personal account in Sri Lanka.
