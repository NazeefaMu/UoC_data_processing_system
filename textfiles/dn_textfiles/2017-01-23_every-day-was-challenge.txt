Every day was a challenge

Luck by chance turned him into a model. Fortune had many accolades in store for him. Designer and fashion model Tymeron Huban Carvalho bagged the Asia’s Top Fashion Male Model of the Year at the Fashion Asia Awards 2016 in China recently.
He was also named the Best Model of the World 2013 in Spain. He even has his own designer label. A fit body, shining personality, dedication, determination and a friendly smile sums up the lad who is now one of the most sought after male models in the industry.
Q: Being named Asia’s Top Fashion Male Model of the Year is quite a feat. Your thoughts?
A: Yes, to be honest it still hasn’t quite hit me because of all the hype and the interviews and work that has followed this victory. However when I do get occasional moments to reflect on that journey, it still makes me smile and my heart skip a beat.
Q: Apart from the finale, what was the most enjoyable moment at Fashion Asia Awards 2016 for you?
A: I must say the entire week in China was remarkable with everyone from Sri Lanka grouping together and having lots of fun. Every day was a challenge just trying to order simple things like food!
Q: What was the toughest moment at the event?
A: I guess the final moments before the announcement!
Q: You were also Best Model of the World 2013. Did that experience help you win Asia’s Top Fashion Male Model of the Year?
A: I was very young at that competition. That win was bittersweet for me as I had just lost my mother and many people put me under undue pressure.
This, however, made me a lot stronger and more determined to succeed. Even though this was many years later, I also had the experience which is what really gave me the needed push.
Q: What is most fulfilling about being a male model?
A: I guess it is being the best body form for a designer to work on.
Q: Are you an outdoor person or an indoor person? What do you like doing outdoors/indoors?
A: I love the gym. I think I am more an indoors person.
Q: Three things that you are most passionate about in life.
1) My body - It’s my passion which has gotten me this far. I am also a strong believer in the fact that I am responsible for what I make of it and the shape I keep it in.
2) My work - As an artist I believe in ME as the face of my brand. It is sometimes difficult for me to differentiate between the two but, my work is a massive part of my life.
3) My pets - Because it was a responsibility I chose.
Q: If you could change one thing about yourself, what would it be?
A: (Bashfully) My short temper. That is simply because I believe being calm helps you achieve more.
Q: What is the most daring thing you have done?
A: I was kidnapped a few years ago. I believe that getting myself out of that situation was the most daring thing I have done.
Q: If you could eat only one food for the rest of your life, what would you choose?
A: Mmmm... Kotthu! (Laughs)
Q: What irritates you?
A: (Vehemently) People with a negative attitude and people who don’t pay on time!
Q: If you got an opportunity to star in a movie, what kind of movie would you like it to be and who would star in it as the female lead opposite you?
A: The movie should be the Middle Eastern folk tale Aladdin. I would love to play the role of Aladdin. Aishwariya Rai should play Princess Jasmine... Hey, you asked! (LOL)
Q: If you were given a chance to splurge on anything, what would you choose?
A: Open an amazing state of the art school inclusive of living quarters for the orphans of the war.
Q: A few words of advice you would give to male models hoping to take part in beauty pageants.
A: Know what you want to be in and then go after it. Most models are discovered because they go into this young. Don’t be foolish and pick modeling schools without or little reputation.
Be positive .
Work out, eat well and make sure you treat your skin and hair well. Ensure you work really hard towards your goal and don’t falter even for a minute.
Be humble. Don’t loose your head no matter which height you reach. If you want to be the best then you have only yourself between your victory or your loss. Either you win or you don’t! Remember there are no mini titles as a star.
Q: If you had not become a designer and model, what would you have been?
A: I don’t consider modeling a profession. I believe I have been fortunate to be born in a time, which has its advantages for those who have dark skin tones.
I was always interested in fashion and design or anything in the arts.
I may have also perused a career in acting if the opportunity arose.
Q: What is the nosiest question you have been asked?
A: Nosy BUT sweet... Constantly, “Are your lashes real???” They even try to pull them off! (LOL)
Q: Tell us a bit about your family.
A: I was born into a conservative and religious background. I am the only child to my parents.
The extended family was large with lots of my maternal siblings and their children, my cousins. All of us grew up in Colombo.
Q: What are you currently engaged in and what is coming up?
A: I have lots of design work and brand building for my label planned these days.
