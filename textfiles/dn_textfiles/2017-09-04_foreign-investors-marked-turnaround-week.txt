Point of view
The ASPI continued to lose grounds by 18.63 points (-0.29% W-o-W) to end at 6,390.74 points with retail activity remaining mostly flat with some profit taking as policy concerns over Inland Revenue Bill buoyed market sentiment1.
Turnover value however rose by 22.8% W-o-W to LKR 3.24Bn, supported mostly by institutional participation in crossings which accounted for 30.88% (or LKR 1.00Bn) of the total turnover value. Counters including JKH, Nestle, Amana Takaful, Commercial Bank and Sampath garnered significant HNI interest among crossings, with large transactions in these counters contributing to 28.53% of the week’s total market turnover that helped drive the rebound in turnover. Consequently, week’s average daily turnover value stood at LKR 0.81Bn over the week, compared to LKR 0.53Bn in the week before.
Meanwhile, foreign investors marked a turnaround ending the week on a net selling position of LKR 0.43Bn after 30 consecutive weeks of foreign buying, mostly attributable to the LKR 0.50Bn transaction in Aitken Spence.

In terms of foreign purchases, JKH topped foreign purchases while Aitken Spence topped foreign sales (both in terms of value and volume of shares).
We expect activity in the following week to be determined by policy direction toward the Inland Revenue Bill expected to be presented in the parliament on September 6th.
