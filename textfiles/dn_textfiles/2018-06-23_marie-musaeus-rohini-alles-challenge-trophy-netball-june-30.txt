Marie Musaeus-Rohini Alles challenge trophy netball on June 30

The Marie Musaeus-Rohini Alles challenge trophy netball encounter between Musaeus College and Gateway College will be held on June 30 at the Royal College Sports Complex from 2.00 pm onwards. It is organised jointly by the Museaus College and Gateway College Netball committees.
The organizers are confident that this encounter will foster enduring traditions and unite the two institutions, both on and off the field.
Students from one of Sri Lanka’s oldest private schools will pit their skills against those from a premier International school in an atmosphere of healthy rivalry and camaraderie. The two schools will vie for the Marie Musaeus-Rohini Alles Challenge Trophy, named after the founders of the two schools.
The annual encounters between the two schools have become a popular feature in the Sri Lankan sports calendar, with almost every sport adopting a shorter format to maintain spectator interest and enthusiasm. The response to this type of encounter was clear in the recently concluded basketball encounter between Royal and Gateway, who broke new ground by uniting two diverse sectors in the Sri Lankan education system.
The main focus of this netball encounter will be the under 20 match between the two schools. An exhibition match will be played between Visakha Vidyalaya and Gateway College, Kandy; and due attention will be paid to upcoming talent by incorporating an under 15 match at the start of this event.
The event will include activities for spectators and a joint follow-up social welfare program.
Former president of Netball Association Victoria Lakshmi will be the chief guest at this inaugural encounter with Rohini Alles, founder of Gateway College as the guest of honour. - SW
