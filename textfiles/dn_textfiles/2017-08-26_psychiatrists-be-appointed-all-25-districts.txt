Psychiatrists to be appointed to all 25 districts

Arrangements will be made soon to appoint 25 psychiatrists to all 25 districts in the country, health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Addressing the inauguration of the ICAP Sri Lanka 2017 conference at Colombo Hilton Residence yesterday, he said that all psychiatrists should unite to provide service to the entire country. Some mental sicknesses cannot be cured either by using medications or counselling.
According to Minister Senaratne, Sri Lankans suffered mentally due to the 30-year long war and the Tsunami. Therefore, it is very important to pay attention towards improving mental health of the people. Sri Lankan people's mental pressure is manifested through their politics and culture.
This international conference will continue till August 27 under the theme, `Enhancing the well-being of individuals to improve the quality of life at home, work and society'.
