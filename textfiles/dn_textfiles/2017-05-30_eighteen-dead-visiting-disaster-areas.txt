Eighteen dead visiting disaster areas

Visiting affected sites unnecessarily has caused 18 unfortunate deaths, Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena said yesterday.
He requested the public to refrain from visiting disaster stricken areas and keep away to avoid unfortunate situations like these deaths.
“When I was visiting Baddegama area, I saw many people visiting disaster affected areas despite warnings issued.They had even accompanied their children and even play on the sand bags piled near certain dams warned of possible wreckage,” Minister Abeywardena pointed out.
He requested the public to adhere to the warnings issued by the police and other responsible agencies and avoid unfortunate incidents.
