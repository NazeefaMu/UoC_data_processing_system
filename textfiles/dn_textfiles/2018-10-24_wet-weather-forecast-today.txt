Wet weather forecast today

The Meteorology Department announced yesterday that showers or thundershowers can occur at several places over the North Western, Western, Southern and Northern coastal areas in the morning.
Thundershowers can develop in inland areas after 2.00 pm and will spread to the North Western, Western and Southern Provinces later.
Heavy rainfall of nearly 100mm can be expected at some places in the Central, Uva and Sabaragamuwa Provinces and in the Ampara district.
There may be temporary localised strong winds during thundershowers as well.
Apart from thundershowers in the sea areas, winds will be northeasterly in the sea areas extending from Trincomalee to Mannar via Kankasanturai. Wind speed will be 20–30 kmph in the sea areas around the island. Temporary strong gusty winds and rough seas can be expected during thundershowers.
