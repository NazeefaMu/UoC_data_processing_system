Four-year research for herbal mosquito repellent

K. Wickramarachchi of Dehiattakandiya has produced a mosquito repellent using medicinal herbs and other items after a strenuous four-year research.
He had first tested its efficacy by distributing it in the form of a capsule among friends.
Since the experiment was successful, he improvised the production process by using an oil extractor provided under the initiative of Deputy Petroleum Resources Development Minister Anoma Gamage, who was informed about the new invention by the Dehiattakandiya Divisional Secretary.
Wickramarachchi has now produced the mosquito repellent in the form of a joss stick. The product was presented to Social Welfare and Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage at his Ministry recently.
Minister Gamage who appreciated Wikramarachchi’s innovative skills promised to give him a machine to help him launch his business, a press release by the Social Welfare and Primary Industries Ministry said.
