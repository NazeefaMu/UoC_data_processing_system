Creating a mindful society

Sati Pasala (Mindful School) was initiated back in March 2016, by a dedicated Buddhist monk in the strict forest tradition, Ven. Udairiyagama Dhammajiva Thero.
The prime motive of the initiative is to take mindfulness to school children in a non-sectarian, non-religious manner.
It promotes mindfulness or "Sati" as a valuable human skill as opposed to a religious norm. So far the programmes conducted by Sati Pasala has received commendable acceptance from schools of all ethnic and religious backgrounds and from the Parliament itself.
Sati Pasala has taken bold steps to take mindfulness to Parliament as well.
President Maithripala Sirisena has shown great interest of the project and a mindfulness programme will be held to the Members of the Parliament, soon.
Global Mindfulness Summit 2018
To show case the unique approach and the success story, Sati Pasala has organized `Global Mindfulness Summit 2018’ which will be inaugurated by the President Maithripala Sirisena on February 23.
The summit will have two days of panel discussions and will feature three interesting pre events.
r Mindfulness Effective strategies to deal with Drug, Tobacco and Alcohol use. (February 17)
Experts will discuss the value of mindfulness in socially relevant and critical issues. Special emphasis will be on using mindfulness as a preventive tool rather than as a therapeutic intervention from destructive habits such as alcohol, drugs and tobacco use.
Destructive habits leading to harmful addictions connected specifically to alcohol, drugs and tobacco are taking a serious toll on young peoples’ lives. Conventional remedies and legislative interventions have had limited impact. Mindfulness which enables training and mastery of the mind, allowing self-control, could help to resist temptations. Mindfulness may prevent habit formation to addictive substances so that young and vulnerable people may not become victims to these trends.
Dr. Nishan de Mel (Director Verité Research), Dr. Sajeewa Ranaweera (SLMA Expert Committee on Alcohol and Tobacco) and Prof. Diyanath Samarasinghe will share their extensive experiences and understanding on the subject at this pre-event, held at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute. In addition, Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister, Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, will be a special speaker at the event.
The Founder of the Sati Pasala Foundation, Ven. Dhammajiva Maha Thero will bring into focus the value of mindfulness and its preventive role in addressing this grave social concern. He will also lead a guided Mindful Sitting Meditation.
r Integrating yoga exercise with mindfulness meditation (February 21)
r Protecting our nature through mindfulness: an Interfaith Dialogue (February 22)
The summit will be addressed by respected spiritual leaders from many religious backgrounds and eminent academics from around the world and it will have a participation of over 600 delegates. Several donor/partner contributions are supporting the Sati Pasala Foundation in this effort and all proceedings are totally free of charge.
