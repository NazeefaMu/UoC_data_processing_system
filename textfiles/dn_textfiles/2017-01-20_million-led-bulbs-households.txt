A million LED bulbs for households

The Power and Renewable Energy Ministry is planning on supplying close to a million LED bulbs to households that continue to use incandescent light bulbs in a bid to save power.
The Secretary to the Ministry, Suren Batagoda, addressing a media briefing yesterday on the Presidential Task Force to solve issues during the drought said they could save close to 40MW of power if the plan was implemented.
“We still have around 20 percent of energy users using these bulbs. It is only 5 percent efficient”, explained Batagoda as he outlined the plans set out to save power during the drought. The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) supplies 3900MW of power to households with 1300MW coming from hydro power but if water levels continue to drop, Batagoda estimated that in the worst case scenario they would have a deficiency of 600-700MW of power.
The Ministry however is adamant that they would not have power cuts during the drought and has included options such as purchasing power from private sources, re-starting power plants and cutting down on the numbers of hours street lights are lit as measures to avoid this fate.
The reduction of street lighting by an hour would save the CEB 20MW of power. The power plants in Embilipitiya, Matara and Puttlam are to be restarted which would supply 225MW.
They have also signed a six month agreement with regional power plants to supply an extra 60MW in extremely dry areas such as Hambantota.
In addition, a recent circular asking that government agencies reduce their A/C usage is expected to help, “We hope to reduce 60-100MW of power usage by controlling A/Cs. Almost 60 percent of demand is used to run the A/Cs,” Batagoda said.
