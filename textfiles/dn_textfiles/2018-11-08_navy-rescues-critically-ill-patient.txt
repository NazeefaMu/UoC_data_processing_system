Navy rescues critically-ill patient

The navy brought ashore a fisherman who had suffered from a heart attack on board a fishing trawler called Laksiri 04, which had left the Gandara fisheries harbour on Monday.
The navy had deployed a Fast Attack Craft (FAC) to rescue the patient after receiving information regarding the incident from the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Department.
Sailors on board and Indian merchant ship called Viswa Vije had brought the patient on board their vessel before he was handed over to the navy, seven nautical miles off Foul Point. The patient was brought to the Trincomalee dockyard before he was admitted to the Trincomalee General Hospital.
