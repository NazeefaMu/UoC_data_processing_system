No amount of protests can topple the government: Rajitha

The Joint opposition will not be able to topple this Government despite staging protests, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Dr. Senaratne, the Ruhunu Development Zone commenced last Saturday. “The Hambantota harbour has no ships as there is no oil storage facility. The previous regime had spent a colossal amount to construct this harbour. Annually the Government pays Rs. 9,500 million as interest for the loan. The income of this harbour is only Rs. 200 million, he said after launching the ‘Happy Villages’ programme at Halkandawila, Beruwala.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that although international waters are just 12 km away from the Hambantota harbour no ships come into the harbour due to the lack of facilities. The company which constructed the harbour says they had bid for US$ 1,100. More than this had been spent to construct the harbour and someone had pocketed Rs. 50 billion.
The previous regime spent a huge sum to construct the Mattala airport, no income is being generated. It is but a white elephant. The former President said there will be an environmental disaster if oil storages are constructed at Hambantota. it is an utter lie. He did not construct it because of a transaction issue. He tried to form a military government but the Attorney General opposed it. This government will turn the country in the right direction before handing it over, he added.
