Rotti debacle lands undergrad in trouble

A university student in the Gangodawila area was reportedly sent away from his boarding house after his landlord spotted the student baking a rotti with the iron he borrowed minutes earlier .
The third-year student had asked for an iron from the landlord woman of the house to get his shirts ironed. She had given him her brand new iron without hesitation.
After awhile, she had gone to the room to get the iron back and had seen that the student was baking a rotti with the brand new iron spreading the rotti on its surface .
After seeing this, the woman had reprimanded the student and sent him away from the house.
