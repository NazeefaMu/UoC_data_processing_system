Provincial Councillor willing to take over Sports and Youth Affairs portfolio

Southern Provincial Council member Randima Gamage said he is prepared to take charge of the Provincial Sports and Youth Affairs Ministry if the President makes arrangements to hand it over to him as he has earlier functioned as monitoring member of the Ministry when it was held by Weerasumane Dissanayake who was relieved of the post recently.
Gamage said he would be able to solicit the support of the joint opposition group in the council too.
Although the opposition members were critical of the UNP, they were prepared to assist good work, he said. He had supported Chief Minister's policy and programme.
He would be able to render laudable service by joining hands with youth, he said.
