Never stop moving, never give up!

The lyrics are deeply meaningful and inspiring. They are insightful and thought provoking. It speaks of life and how to face life with the right attitude. It talks about fighting back. It talks of never giving up. It talks of persevering and taking up the challenge.
“You needed a trailWe helped you blaze itAll the roadsWe helped you make itYou needed an adventureWe took you thereYou unleashed your wingsAnd we became the air(Chorus)We never never stop moving ///(Bridge)
You needed a heroWe became itYou took the journeyWe helped you make itYou’ve got the powerJust go embrace itTake a chanceCoz you can make itBreak down the bouldersFly through the airJust unleash your wings and we can take you there……….

The lyrics are by Ashanthi De Alwis and they are intensely stirring lyrics. Ashanthi is known as a prolific Sri Lanka rapper, singer and songwriter.

“This is my second production with CEAT, I have a good relationship with the whole CEAT Sri Lanka team. I shared my concept with them and they were happy to be a part of this. Sri Lanka is so beautiful and my idea was to take Sri Lanka to the world through this Music Video. To do this we feature powerful and evocative imagery of Sri Lanka places,” explained Peiris.
“Never Stop Moving” can be viewed on Youtube, Facebook and Google and is also expected to be telecasted by local channels shortly.
“I hope the exciting imagery created by Director of Photography Chamath Hansaka and the skills of Production Coordinator Yashinka Silva will resonate with audiences around the world and generate wider interest in what Sri Lanka has to offer its people, visitors, while providing music enthusiasts with great entertainment,” pointed out Peiris.

As a maker of tyres, CEATs principal role is to help people get to places and the title and theme of the music video is so aligned to what we are about. We were convinced to support its production,” added Marketing of Sponsor CEAT Kelani Holdings, Deputy General Manager Bishri Latiff.
