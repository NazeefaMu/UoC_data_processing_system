Germany goes to polls

Parliamentary elections in Germany, the most powerful member state of the European Union will bwe held tomorrow (24th). Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) is expected to win with ease. In an opinion poll last week it had received 36 percent of votes while its alliance partner Social Democratic Union (SDU) polled 22 percent. Alternative for German (AfG) and the Left Party are competing for the third pace with around 11 and 12 percent.
In the Bundestag CDU have 311 seats out of 630. If it wins Angela Merkel will become Chancellor for a record fourth time. However, CDU – CSU Alliance may not get an absolute majority in the Bundestag and hence it will have to go into a coalition with at least one minor party which will need hard bargaining.
A noteworthy and alarming feature of the election is the support that the far right-wing pro-fascist Alternative for Germany has received. In the elections in 2013 it received only 4. 3 percent whereas the last opinion poll showed that its support has increased to 11 percent. It is the only German political party that welcomed the Trump victory and UK’s exit (Brexit) from the European Union. Incidentally such fresh support for the far right is contrary to the general trend against such views as shown during the elections in France and Britain.
One major reason for the added support for the AfG is the problem of increased immigrants in Germany. Anti-immigrant sentiment in the country has compelled even Angela Merkel to promise tighter border control though her government has been the most liberal in accepting and welcoming refugees into Germany.
Unlike in France and Britain no surprises are expected at the German elections after which the status-quo is expected to continue.
May proposes post-Brexit UK – EU partnership
The second phase of EU – Britain talks on Brexit is scheduled to take place on October 19 – 20. British Prime Minister Theresa May has proposed a new economic and security partnership between the EU and the UK after the latter’s exit from the EU in May 2019.
However, the European Union is reluctant to enter the second phase without concluding the first phase, discussions on it being inconclusive. The EU insists on three conditions for completing the first phase. According to them Britain must pay adequate compensation to the EU, the amount running to several billions of Euros. Britain is willing to pay but differences remain over the amount. The second condition is about the Irish border about which agreement has to be reached. The third is the status of European citizens in Britain. The EU wants the present status and privileges for its resident to remain unchanged. Britain, on the other had wants to restrict them and grant a special status not amounting to full citizenship. The European Union will keep the status quo of British citizens in its member states unchanged. At present they enjoy all privileges of other citizens of those countries.
Prime Minister May was expected to give a Speech in Florence Friday (22) outlining her new proposals. She proposes a two-year transition period after UK leaves Britain. She is also willing to pay 10 billion Euros as compensation. EU expects much more. May proposes that the amount is to be discussed and agreed during the transition period. She has also pledged more privileges to EU citizens remaining in the UK after Brexit.
Anniversary of Sabra and Shatila massacre
September 16 is a Dark Day in the Palestine calendar. On that day 35 years ago –September 16, 1982 - following the Israeli invasion of Lebanon right-wing Christian Phalange militia stormed Sabra and Shatila Palestinian refugee camps in West Beirut and massacred hundreds, maybe thousands of their inmates, including many children.
The invasion began on June 6 after the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which had defended the camps since its inception, agreed to leave Lebanon in August. The PLO was given an assurance by the United States that civilians left behind would be protected. On September 14 Lebanese President elect was assassinated and Israel army invaded and occupied West Lebanon. It surrounded the refugee camps so that none could leave them. Phalangist militias then stormed the camps and conducted the massacre under protection from the Israeli Army.
The massacre lasted two days. Israeli army supplied the bulldozers to dig mass graves. In 1983, Israel’s investigative Kahan Commission found that Ariel Sharon, the Israeli Defence Minister, bore “personal responsibility” for the slaughter.
The massacre at Sabra and Shatila was a direct consequence of Israel’s violation of the American-brokered ceasefire and the impunity bestowed on Israel by the US and the international community that provided impunity to the killers should be held responsible for it.
Israel continues its aggression and violation of human rights of the Palestinians even today. The entire Gaza strip is a prison as a permanent siege is maintained by the Israeli army. Palestinian territory is rolled back and Jewish settlements are erected in Palestinian land after expelling the residents by force of arms. Water, electricity and other basic amenities are not provided to them and their movements are restricted. All civilized nations and peoples should call upon Israel to abandon its genocidal and apartheid policies. Palestinians should not be left to the mercy of the invader.
