Private medical universities: GMOA stays neutral

The GMOA has taken a neutral stance on the subject of private medical universities and stated that it was up to the government to decide whether to establish private medical universities or not.
Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Naveen de Soysa, said the government should appoint a commission to study whether the country needs private medical universities or not and then establish them while maintaining minimum standards.
“SAITM and our stance on private medical universities are two different things. SAITM is fraudulent.
“The two cannot be compared, you cannot justify SAITM by saying that we need private medical universities, the two are different,”stressed, Dr de Soysa addressing a media conference held at the GMOA headquarters yesterday.
The GMOA has also asked that SAITM be taken over by the state with compensation or alternative pathways to a medical degree found for current SAITM medical students with adequate qualifications to follow a medical degree. The Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) nor the University Grants Commission (UGC) in the meantime has prescribed standards for medical institutions.

The Government Medical Officers’ Union (GMOA) members from the East and North Central Province will engage in trade union action today.
Their actions follow that of the doctors from the Uva Province who launched trade union action for four hours on Tuesday.
The token strikes would be followed by protests in Ampara and Anuradhapura, said GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge yesterday addressing a media briefing at GMOA headquarters in Colombo 7.
“We have put forward our recommendations to the relevant authorities 10 days ago and we are yet to receive a response. The government only understands strikes, so the union has decided to resort to trade union action”, he said.
The GMOA central committee which was to meet yesterday would also decide on a plan to launch long term continuous protests throughout the country until the issue of SAITM is resolved, “We will ensure that the patience do not suffer much and emergency services will be carried out throughout this period”, he added.
The decision for an island wide strike is to be decided by Monday, said Dr Aluthge.
GMOA, Secretary, Dr Naveen de Soysa in the meantime said the trade union action was also against the two main ministers, Minister of Higher Education and Highways, Lakshman Kiriella and Minister of Health and Indigenous Medicine, Rajitha Senaratne who he alleged to be on the side of SAITM.
He stated that the solution to SAITM should not be sought through courts but it was a political decision which needed to be made, “the Executive should intervene and we believe that the President will take a good decision on the matter”.
The President in the meantime has appointed a committee to study the issues surrounding SAITM and has promised to arrive at a decision which will be in the interest of the country once the views of all stakeholders are taken into account.
