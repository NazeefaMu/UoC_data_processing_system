Lak Sathosa, private millers to convert 90,000 tons of paddy into rice

The Cabinet yesterday revealed that the Rural Economic Affairs Ministry has ordered that 90,958 metric tons of paddy owned by the Paddy Marketing Board at district level be handed over to private paddy mill owners and Lanka Sathosa to be converted to rice.
While Lanka Sathosa has already processed the paddy and is selling it at Rs.76 per kilogram, many of the private mill owners have not made the paddy available on the market.
A Cabinet Sub Committee has been appointed to oversee the issuing of rice stocks and to take action against mill owners who have not issued their stocks to the market. The Cabinet of Ministers stated that the Indonesian government will donate 10,000 metric tons of rice that should be in the country soon. It also noted the need of importing rice from countries such as Indonesia and Vietnam unless rice is made cheaper.
