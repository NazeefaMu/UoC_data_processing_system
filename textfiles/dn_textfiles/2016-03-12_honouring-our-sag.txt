Himasha Eshan who won the Gold medal in the men's 100m to become the fastest man in South Asia at the South Asian Games (SAG) which held at Guwahati, India. He broke Chinthaka Soysa's 17-year- old record of 10:29 in 1999 by clocking 10:28 and renewed the South Asian 100m record too.

Himasha Eshan
The experience of finishing fifth place in the 100m event at the Asian Junior Sports Festival in 2012 was a motivation to go for the gold medal in the Asian Athletic Games Championship in 2013. He won the 100x4m relay and followed it up with a win in the Lucifornia Sports Festival's in the 100x4 and 100m silver medal in 2014 Asian Junior Sports Festival. He also participated at the World Junior Athletic Championship in America. He made a strong bid to break the 100x4m Sri Lankan Record at the Asian Athletic Championship last year but failed narrowly.
"Once an allegation of taking a banned steroid (drugs) was leveled against me and I was banned from participating. But my coach Chaminda Perera, teachers and relatives were behind me and I got a chance to free myself from blame," medalist Himasha said.
Prof Arjuna de Silva of the Ministry of Sports forecast that according to his genetic strength, Himasha would surely participate at the Olympics.
Himasha is from a middle class family, his father is a minor businessman and mother who is a housewife. He has an elder brother and a sister.
Suranjaya de Silva: Men's 200m
Suranjaya de Silva won the 200m at the SAG Games at Guwahati, India and by doing so fulfilled a dream. Suranjaya was born in Brahmanawatte, an urban village off Balapitiya and studied at Revatha Vidyalaya and Ambalangoda Devananda Vidyalaya. He was not an outstanding athlete in school but he showed his colours at the last National Sports Festival breaking the 100m and 200m event records.Suranjaya said that he was unable to break the Sri Lanka record because of the cool climate in Guwahati and the lack of synthetic tracks in Sri Lanka which is hindering his progress.
"I won the Bronze in the 100x4m relay at the Army Athletic Championship in Korea and I broke a Sri Lankan record in the 100x4m event at the Woohan Asian Athletic Championship. I have no big experience about international games but I have self confidence to go a long journey," said Suranjaya.
Suranjaya paid a glowing tribute to his coach Chaminda Perera, Maj. Gen. Palitha Fernando (SL Army), Maj. Muthumala and Tharushi for the support extended to him to reach this standard.
Suranjaya's father is a mason and his mother is a housewife who supports him. He is a Corporal of the SL Army Electric and Mechanical Engineering regiment.
