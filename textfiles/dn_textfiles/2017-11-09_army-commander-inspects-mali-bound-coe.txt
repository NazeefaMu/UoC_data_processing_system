Army Commander inspects Mali bound COE

Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake on Tuesday afternoon, visited the Colombo port to inspect the Army’s Mali-bound consignment of Contingent Owned Equipment (COE), being loaded aboard the vessel, scheduled to set sail shortly.
The shipment included 55 containers, inclusive of self-sustained equipment, combat vehicle equipment, de-mining and explosive ordnance devices and various other logistic paraphernalia.
Lieutenant General Senanayake, together with the Director Operations at the Army Headquarters and the Quarter Master General (QMG) shared their views and inquired into other aspects of the operation and its smooth passage before the deadline. The Mali Contingent Commander was also at hand during the Commander’s visit.
A few months ago, the UN invited a battalion of officers and other rankers from the Sri Lanka Army to join its peace-keeping initiatives in Mali, affected due to ethnic tensions.
The Sri Lankan Army contingent is to assist the ongoing United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA), designed to strengthen the political process there while carrying out a number of other security-related tasks.
Sri Lanka has produced around 16,000 peacekeepers so far with missions, deployed in Lebanon, Sudan and South Sudan, etc. In South Sudan, the Army took professionalism to foreign shores with the establishment of its first-ever SRIMED Level 2 hospital in Bor, under the UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS).
