Microsoft, Intel, Adidas among recipients  of International Innovation Awards in China

Thirty-one products, services and organizations received the ‘InnoCube’ as recipients of the International Innovation Awards 2017.
Leading the pack was Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) who won an award for the Microsoft HoloLens and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) for its Ideas2Reality, an innovation program in its unit in China.
Adidas AG (ADSGn.DE) won the award for its Ultraboost Uncaged Parley.
Other recipients range from a dietary supplement from sesame and a digital premium savings certificate to an anti-bacterial textile and an integrated mechanical parking system.
The awards were organized by Enterprise Asia. Submissions were judged on creativity and ideation, as well as execution and impact. William Ng, president of Enterprise Asia said, “Innovation requires some degree of creativity, but innovation is not creativity. More than anything else, innovation is about execution.
No idea can work in a silo, as such, in determining the recipients of the International Innovation Awards, the judges took into consideration such criteria as innovation distinction, practicality and performance, commercial viability, replicability and measurability, and institutional support. The goal is to put substance ahead of form; execution ahead of ideation”.
“Great companies are also great at execution. But generally, they are great at executing their core businesses. The capabilities and capacity to execute these core businesses, and that singular focus to execute well, are often anathema to innovation.
Therefore, these companies that have won the International Innovation Awards are a step ahead of their competitors”, Ng added. The recipients of the International Innovation Awards this year also receive the InnoMark, the global certification for innovation.
Enterprise Asia strive to create an Asia that is rich in entrepreneurship as an engine towards sustainable and progressive economic and social development reinforced by its strong pillars of: Democratizing Entrepreneurship, Institutionalizing Sustainability and Empowering Innovation. The International Innovation Awards 2017 recognizes outstanding innovations and in the process, provide the encouragement for organizations to continue investing in innovation.
The Awards provide a platform for companies and innovators to recognise innovation excellence, hence stimulating greater innovations to spur and for growth in economy
