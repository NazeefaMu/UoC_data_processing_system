Prices of a cup of tea, lunch packets, hoppers to increase

 
The Restaurant Owners’ Union has decided to increase the prices of a cup of plain tea, milk tea, lunch parcels and hoppers from tomorrow due to the increased price of LP gas.
Accordingly the prices will be increased to Rs. 20, Rs. 40, Rs. 130 and Rs.15, respectively.
