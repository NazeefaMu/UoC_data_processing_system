Champions Trophy to be first ever ‘Smart Cricket’ tournament

With Spidercam and drones utilised:
The Champions Trophy is set to be the first ever ‘Smart Cricket’ tournament.
Competition organisers have placed an emphasis on innovation and technology around players from all eight teams, match officials and supporters watching at home and in the stadiums.
When the tournament begins next week, for the first time in cricket players’ movement will be tracked by cameras and the data collected and analysed. Eight ultra-motion hawk-eye cameras will be in place at each of the three venues: The Oval, Edgbaston and Sophia Gardens. A Spidercam will also be used, accompanied by drone cameras utilised for the first time.
Team sheets will be signed and submitted via tablet and HD wifi is available in each stadium for fans.
Tournament director Steve Elworthy said: ‘I think it probably is up there [as the first Smart Cricket tournament]. Everything we’ve done when we’ve sat down and planned this, we say "Smart" immediately you jump a technology solution for it.
'There are a number of things we’ve learnt from previous tournaments that we’ll do in a smarter way. How we share data and communications across the tournament, the different venues and stakeholder groups.
‘Ultimately it’s thinking about technology and how we use it to improve the experience for everybody, whether it be the players, match officials and the fans. It is more around thinking about the fan engagement in the ground.
'The tournaments I’ve run to date definitely it’s up there with the most technologically advanced ones.’ - Daily Mail
