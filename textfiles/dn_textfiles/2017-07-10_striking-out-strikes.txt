Striking out strikes

Protesters took to the streets across the country over the last few months for several reasons. The protests took different forms and at some, violence broke out, while several others engaged in non-violent protests. Here are views expressed by professionals from different fields regarding the recent protests and their response to whether these protests depict a breakdown of discipline in the country.
Public Representations Committee on Constitutional Reform Chairman Lal Wijenayake
The protests, walks etc., taking place in the country at the moment cannot be recognised as a breakdown of discipline in the country. This is the only way the people are enjoying the freedom they won on January 8, 2015. In a sense, we can say that this is a counter-revolution and we have to defeat it. I am sure we will defeat it easily. I do not have any doubt about that.
We went through a period where the people feared to walk out of their homes and offices to protest. Sometimes those who did so went missing. Some were abducted. No one spoke against corruption. The media was silent. Murders such as the Welikada Prison killing, Lasantha Wickramathunga murder etc., took place but no one spoke against them. In January, 2015, what the people asked for was freedom and democracy. Now the people respect law and order of the country more than before. Today judges are free to give judgements. The Police is doing their duty properly sans political pressure.
Elements are trying to bring back the previous regime use this freedom to get their task done because now they are in a 'do or die situation.'
They have to bring back the previous regime within a year or two or they will go to jail. There are very serious murder charges, corruption charges etc., against them. They bring people into the roads. Sometimes they say they are farmers, but they do not look like farmers. They look like paid thugs.
SP Governor Hema Kumara Nanayakkara
There is a severe breakdown of discipline in the country and many unwanted protests. The general breakdown of the law and order in the country is, in a way, politically motivated. Some political groups want to dislodge the government, but they cannot do it through mob violence. The government exercises democracy with the people's mandate. Politicians who promote protests have sent their children abroad for studies in foreign universities. I appeal to the students to not just believe and accept what their leaders say without thinking twice and double-checking. Going into a state ministry and damaging public property is practicing ‘freedom of the wild ass.’ The government should be blamed for not taking action. The students should be rehabilitated because their minds have been poisoned.
Whenever a teacher is transferred, schoolchildren and parents come onto the streets demanding him/her back. The very person who received the transfer motivates people to do this. They are being guided to beat at their chests and shout. The parents are insulting their own children. Transferring teachers is a duty bestowed on the Education Department and Education Ministry.
The parents can seek to resolve their issues with the education authorities, MPs, Ministers etc. The media also should be responsible because some media go to villages and encourage people to come onto the streets.
People go on strikes even for the slightest thing. This is a bad habit. First, they should sit and discuss with the officials. If it fails, they should discuss with the Ministry Secretary and then with the Minister. Only if all efforts fail, should they resort to a strike. Strikes are there to win rights and not to put the public in trouble.
The roads in Colombo are blocked almost every day now.
As children, we have never seen doctors go on strike. There were problems for doctors at that time too. SAITM is a big problem, but it should be solved through discussions. The protesters are taking revenge from the innocent people and not from the politicians. The GMOA should not be a politically motivated organisation. It should be there to win doctors' rights. Politicians go to private hospitals or abroad and get treatment. At least 60 percent of doctors are from poor families. They punish their own class.
If politicians have done something wrong, the doctors should punish them and not the public. The government should solve the SAITM issue. It should not soft-peddle when someone breaks the law. Law and order should be maintained. The judiciary should not be interfered with; the judiciary is supreme. Even garbage collection is an important job. Law and order of the country should be strictly implemented; it is the responsibility of the government. Future generations which are going to take over the country should be well-disciplined.
Sri Lanka Bar Association President U. R. de Silva
Staging a protest is not a solution to the problem. The protesters against SAITM are doing an improper thing. Last week also, when the case was brought up in Court, the students held a silent protest outside. But there was also an application to intervene and that is the best way if they wish to do something. The GMOA has gone before Courts and mentioned that the order was in favour. That is the correct procedure. We informed the Court as well that it is a sensitive matter and an order should be given for the final. What they are doing now is an insult to Courts.
I think the students are innocent; they need justice and now the responsibility is with the Supreme Court. The lawyers should be given proper instructions by the necessary authorities. Whether if it is in favour of or not, you have to accept the order. Until the order is given, no one can go around the country and stage protests as the matter is in Courts. When one party was not in favour of the decision, they went to the Supreme Court, which was the correct procedure. The matter will be solved within a few months. Till such time, it is not ethical to stage protests in front of the Courts. The students need to concentrate on their studies as well.
Another recent problem was with regard to the Constitution. The objections raised are very premature. A committee appointed by the government has prepared a draft Constitution, but that’s not the final draft.
Anybody can go through that document. There can be pros and cons in the Constitution drafted, but the public still have time to submit their suggestions. Parliament has also appointed various committees. The final decision is to be taken by the people.
The government clearly mentioned it. This is not the right time to oppose. Very progressive suggestions were made regarding the Courts and judiciary. All these suggestions are being considered. Without organizing protests, they could organise seminars to create awareness among people.
The other big problem was the disposal of garbage. The people who have suffered had lodged a petition to the Supreme Court. The Chief Justice has asked for a report and a survey map of the areas in which the government is intending to dump garbage. These issues need to be carefully handled. The problem was that they just started dumping garbage without any assessment being done. That needs to be stopped.
The government is also slow to act; they should take immediate and proper action. People cannot wait so long. The garbage issue was in Courts even before the Meethotamulla garbage dump collapsed, but Government authorities deliberately prolonged the cases. They gave a lot of excuses which should have been curtailed.
Court also has the responsibility to solve these matters as soon as possible. The people tend to take the law into their hands when cases get delayed. People stage protests because they feel that there is no point in going to Courts. There are various issues pertaining to Court procedures as well, which lead to this and one of them is the lack of judges. Measures are being taken to increase the quota but that should be done immediately.
Colombo University Senior Professor and Police Commission Chairman Prof. Siri Hettige
People protest when institutions become ineffective. The protests that are being held cannot be generalised, but people tend to protest or show their displeasure when the authorities fail to perform their duties correctly. When the government goes for a project with a wide range of implications, the institution should manage it in an effective manner. There is a technical side to any project; therefore, the relevant authority should make sure that all these aspects are very well handled.
Politicians should come at the last stage, once all technical aspects of the project have been fixed. If the project is not economically and technically viable and if is not going to benefit the people around, the authorities should not take it up.
On the other hand, even if you do all the procedures systematically, there are so many people who will object to the project. These are people who want to protest even for smaller things, but that is a different thing.
However, the government can eliminate the possibilities of the protests by following due process. We have taken many decisions without adhering to proper standards.
The decisions were politically motivated. The best way to address this issue of protests is to ask the person who is taking the decision on what basis they are doing so. SAITM was not something that was initiated last year.
There are many issues that need to be addressed with regard to private and public education.
It would be more appropriate to say that there is a governance problem in this country than breakdown of discipline. It is fundamental and it goes back to several decades.
The governance problem did become intolerable in this country at many instances. We have not been able to establish governance standards in this country.
Now good governance has become a laughing factor for many people. Some think that Sri Lanka does not need good governance; unfortunately, we have come to that situation. The decisions taken should demand for good governance, but that is not happening at present.
At times, public protests are deep-rooted. It is the responsibility of the government to look into the problem and take immediate measures to solve it. There are problems with our economy and the education system. Therefore, the youth do not see a future for them.
These issues should not be taken at face value, but need better management and governance.
Attorney-at-Law and Senior Lecturer of the University of Colombo Dr. Prathibha Mahanamahewa
We cannot blame only politicians with regard to this issue. Violence today is not only in the country, but it’s in society as well as in our homes. One of the main reasons behind the breakdown in discipline in the country is unnecessary competition in the examination system starting from grade five scholarship to university level.
Teachers have no time to explain the values and morals of society to children as before due to the lengthy syllabus they have to cover. Another factor which is contributing a decline in social value is students not having time to participate in Sunday school and religious activities on Poya days because of tuition classes.
Considering this, the government must take policy decisions in future to address these issues.
Though the right to strike is a fundamental human right, the 1978 Sri Lanka Constitution has not recognised this right as a fundamental human right. According to the 1939 Trade Union Ordinance, reasonable strikes are recognised.
On the other hand, right to education is a fundamental human right too; therefore, any strike against or which restrict or attempt to restrict right to education is not reasonable or justified. Hence, the State’s responsibility is to protect the right to education and save millions of rupees in Sri Lanka which is grabbed by other medical colleges in the region.
Today, Sri Lanka needs many more medical doctors to save the nation and a strike against such cannot be condoned, it is also the State’s responsibility to expand the accessibility to right to quality medical education in this country.
