Decision on using elephants in peraheras after committee report

President Maithripala Sirisena will commence a special programme to supply elephants for Peraheras after studying the committee report on the issue, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Addressing the gathering before commencing Mihindu Perahera, organized by the Ingiriya Imagira Shri Bodhiraja Viharaya recently, he said according to Albert Einstein, Buddhist philosophy is something scientific. It is Buddhist Bhikkus who protected Buddhism for 2,500 years.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that as Buddhist devotees, all of us should assist Buddhist Bhikkus to protect the Buddha Sasana. There is a huge demand in Europe for Theravada Buddhism. That is why British rulers sponsored the Sri Dalada Perahera during the colonial era. Perahera shows the world our rich cultural heritage, the minister said.
“Obtaining elephants for peraheras is an issue. Environmentalists say elephants should be protected. We have to protect our cultural heritage. Therefore, a committee is appointed to look into the matter and to make recommendations. A proper system will be set up to achieve both objectives”, he added.
