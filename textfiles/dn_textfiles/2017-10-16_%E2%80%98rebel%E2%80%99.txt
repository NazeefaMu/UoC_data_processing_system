The ‘rebel’

Do women who take over the ownership of businesses previously owned and run by their fathers face unique issues? How do they stand up to the image of the male role that was in charge earlier? Or do they create their own image and take the reins regardless of ill omens? “My father was a strong personality. I had to shut down my personality before I took over. It was more a mission than a career path. There were cultural differences and I could sense that people were in two minds before they nodded for my decisions. It took some time for the management to accept a different personality,” says Sanasa Development Bank (SDBL), Chairperson, Samadanie Kiriwandeniya.
“It was a learning process for me as well. I received immense support from the Board. I made changes in the management as I wanted the bank to shine not individuals. Those who could not perform had to quit as I wanted the team to be highly professional and technically qualified,” she added.
Being the daughter of Sanasa’s visionary leader, Dr. P. A. Kiriwandeniya whose commitment is legendary within the country, she had to steer ahead the work he began. “There were five girls in the family. Who is going to take after and follow father’s footsteps was always a question. From very young days, the social movement fascinated me. I read extensively about revolutions. I loved to go around the country and always believed that the local community has the strength to do revolutionary things. So I took up the challenge of creating innovations through Sanasa bank to direct funds and deliver proper products to uplift the lives of the rural community,” Kiriwandeniya said.
Samadanie Kiriwandeniya was appointed the Chairperson of the Sanasa Development Bank (SDBL) in 2011 thus becoming the youngest Chairperson in the banking industry. She is also a Corporate Leader of the Sanasa Corporative Group. She holds senior management experience in the fields of participatory development, gender issues management, microfinance and conflict resolution. In 2013 she was figured among the 50 most powerful women in Sri Lanka and was ranked as the 6th most powerful business leader for three consecutive years by Echelon Magazine. Kiriwandeniya has obtained her basic degree in Sociology and continued with a Master’s Degree in the same field at the University of Saskatchewan, Canada.
“I received my education in three schools: Musaeus College Colombo, Kandy High School and St Joseph’s College, Kegalle. Then I entered the Peradeniya University and completed my Masters at the University of Saskatchewan, Canada. As a child I grew up seeing the Sanasa movement my father created. Starting at Sanasa was not really a job selection for me, but basically I wanted to support the effort of my father’s vision to build a self-reliant rural community. Working with a Canadian Corporative Organisation in the development field especially in Northern and Eastern Provinces equipped me with a lot of experience. I first started at the Marketing Department negotiating with international organizations to contribute in the development of the rural community. I created the international relations of the bank. We had to place proper strategies and selectively engage into partnership with international community after the tsunami catastrophe which we did for two years successfully,” Kiriwandeniya said.
Sanasa Development Bank started with a social movement in order to support development project.
Sanasa Development Bank is a unique bank committed to uplifting the standards of living for low income Sri Lankan families with its range of microfinance activities. The ownership of the bank is confined to Sanasa Movement, the only microfinance cooperative network in Sri Lanka which covers all provinces with 8,424 primary societies. It reaches close to one million members and over three million individuals.
No one ever asks a man whether they can run a company and be a father at the same time. This question which a career woman is always asked sends a subtle message to young women that they have to sacrifice their motherhood to excel in their careers.
“Whether you are a man or a woman you can contribute meaningfully to the society. You have to hang on and think there is always someone going through the same journey. Many who were close to me asked me to quit at that time as it was quite a stress handling children and work. If you are prepared and committed you can overcome circumstances. It is a learning path. You have to compromise in order to learn something. Negotiating and balancing every aspect of life is important. However, it is rewarding at the end,” Kiriwandeniya said.
We were a continuously moving family. With a husband who has his professional duties it was not easy looking after two daughters but we were able to expose them to our work. All working mothers should be given the opportunity to expose their children to work life. Looking at what parents do will encourage children and they will learn without words and structures. I was never behind my daughters and did not wait for occasion to make the perfect vacation but used every opportunity to mingle with them and spend time meaningfully,” she added.
Kiriwandeniya says that she earns respect from her family for what she does to the society. “I hardly get a chance to accomplish my responsibilities as a house wife. My family respects me for the contribution I make to the society and country. You have to know your priorities and when you are a woman you have to have quality and smart partnerships. It could be with your extended family, maids or neighbours. You have to master the art of building relationships with others to manage work and personal life. A woman’s life is connected with others. You have to take others with you to succeed. Every time a woman takes two steps forward she will be reversed a step behind due to family obligations. A woman has to have a holistic approach otherwise finally she will be on top but not have anyone around her,” she said. “Success behind me was, I was not prepared to give up or lose. I had a mission and knew my capabilities and I am focused to go further and assist the community which was my father’s vision and dream,” she concluded.
