FCID to probe bus-permit malpractice

 
Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation, Nimal Siripala De Silva said today that the National Transport Commission (NTC) has taken 2095 files to the FCID to investigate into various malpractices which had occurred when granting bus route permits during the previous regime.
The Minister noted that the regulation of the transport sector has become a major issue.  
“It is a problem whether we can control it through legal, ethical or through means of good governance”, he added.
“A large number of people come to me every day for a route permit and I have to turn them back. I tell them, come to me only if you are prepared to adhere to the principles of good governance. I cannot grant permits in an illegal manner”, said the Minister at a workshop on the strengthening of the national and provincial transport sector held at Waters Edge.
They also made the decision at the workshop to install CCTV cameras in bus stands to curb the issue of buses still being subjected to ransom demands. The NTC is to fund the initiative.
It was also noted that long distance buses were stopping at unnecessary places and thus the CCTV would also help put a stop to that.
