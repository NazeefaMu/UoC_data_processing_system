Shashi Welgama further remanded till Feb.16

Two persons including former Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) Chairman Shashi Welgama, a nephew of former Transport Minister Kumara Welgama, were yesterday ordered to be further remanded till February 16 by Colombo Additional Magistrate J. Trotsky for allegedly cheating and misappropriating Rs. 125 million of public funds when purchasing a stock of leaf springs to the SLTB between 2010 and 2012.
At a previous occasion, the Court refused to grant bail to the suspects citing there are no exceptional circumstances to release them on bail. However, the defence had filed a fresh bail application on behalf of the suspects and the Court is to deliver its bail order on next hearing date.
On December 20, 2016 Welgama and Nandana Priyantha Perera, the owner of Nandana Auto Products Co. Limited were arrested by the CID regarding an investigation into a financial fraud said to have taken place when purchasing leaf springs to the SLTB.
The CID had informed Court that the SLTB on two occasions had paid advance payments amounting to Rs. 40 million and Rs. 166 million to Perera to provide leaf springs to the SLTB.
The CID further alleged that the suspect had supplied the leaf springs to SLTB with a deficiency, which amounted Rs. 24 million and Rs. 101 million.
The CID further alleged that the former SLTB Chairman had authorised the financial transactions acting in his capacity as the then SLTB Chairman. The CID further informed Court that original documents pertaining to this fraudulent transaction had been destroyed by the previous administration and a complaint regarding this incident had been made by present SLTB Chairman Ramal Siriwardena.
The suspects are charged under the offences under the Public Property Act.
President’s Counsel Kalinga Indatissa appearing for the former SLTB Chairman had denied the allegations levelled against his client citing that there is no evidence to prove that his client was involved in the financial transaction. He told Court that his client had undergone a bypass surgery in 2014 and that fact be considered as an exceptional circumstance to release him on bail. At a previous occasion, the Court had issued an order directing the Controller of the Emigration and Immigration to prevent four individuals including the former SLTB Chairman, Nandana Priyantha, Sanjeewa Waidyatilleke, and Sumith Hettiarachchi from leaving the country.
