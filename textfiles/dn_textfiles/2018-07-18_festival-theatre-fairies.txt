Somalatha Subasinghe Play  House annual theatre festival
Festival for  theatre fairies

The Somalatha Subasinghe Play House presents its annual theatre festival for children and youth at Lionel Wendt Theatre from August 9 to 12. The festival will feature four plays produced by Somalatha Subasinghe Play House.
Vikurthi (Distortion) written and directed by Somalatha Subasinghe will be on August 9. Ratmalee (Red Riding Hood) and Punchi Apata Dan Therei (Little Red Hen) written and directed by Somalatha Subasinghe on August 10.
Walas Pawula (The Three Bears and Goldilocks) written by Somalatha Subasinghe and directed by Chandana Aluthge on August 11 and 12.
All these plays are musical productions which are based on international folk and fairy tales. They are produced with the objective to instil in children, a sense of basic art forms and a pride in our own culture as well as to promote the importance of the institution of family and its values. In addition, the lessons of love, humanity and world awareness are refreshingly presented in these plays. In the adaptations, new characters and situations have been incorporated particularly to facilitate an intellectual and entertaining discourse with the Sri Lankan child.
Satirical exposure
Punchi Apata Dan Therei (We know it Now) is a prescribed text for Grade six drama and theatre and Grade nine Sinhala Language and literature.
Vikurthi is an original play and is a satirical exposure of hapless generation of youth whose lives were dominated by the incessant struggle between the parents’ aspirations and the youth’s abilities and preferences. In the 1980s, at the time the drama was conceived, the widespread social tendency was that the aspiring parents trying to achieve the missed opportunities of their own lives through their children. Consequently, the children were forced to study for competitive government examinations such as GCE (O/L) and GCE (A/L), specifically in the Science Stream disregarding their aptitudes and available resources at respective schools and the universities. The play discusses in depth how this anti-social process denied the youth of their own life, which in turn deeply affects them in many ways. The production is a semi-musical which is a familiar theatrical experience to the local audiences.
Foreign audience
Vikurthi was first performed in 1982 in Colombo and since then had performed more than 1500 performances in Sri Lanka in the last 36 years. The play is considered a landmark theatre production and as a result, Vikurthi became a trendsetter of a new style of modern theatre in Sri Lanka. It is also considered as a pioneering effort of youth theatre concept in Sri Lanka. The professional theatre group of Somalatha Subasinghe Play House has performed Vikurthi in English in major cities in India and Australia in 2000. The play has been received well by the foreign audiences.
Vikurthi is a prescribed text for drama and theatre for GCE O/L and the performance will be a good opportunity for students, who are sitting for GCE O/L examination shortly, to watch the play with their parents.
The production style of these plays has been developed so as to give the audiences an aesthetic journey of entertainment.
