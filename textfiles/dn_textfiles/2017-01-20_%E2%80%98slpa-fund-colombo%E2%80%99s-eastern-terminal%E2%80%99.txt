‘SLPA to fund Colombo’s Eastern terminal’

The government is looking at the possibility to initiate operations in Colombo’s Eastern terminal through its own funds,Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranatunge said.
He said that they face many challenges when taking loans.“If we could free ourselves from the installment to be paid, we can obtain a loan for a lower interest rate. Then we will be able to develop the Eastern terminal under a different method. The Sri Lanka Ports Authority owns a larger portion and we are not going to assign the port to others.”
Minister Ranathunga expressed these views while speaking in a ceremony which was held in the Mahapola training institute. “We have taken every possible step to sign the agreement in a way it gives more advantages to the institutions related to the subject of Ports and Shipping.”
“We are not working to destroy the port, which was developed due to the contribution by the workers”, Minister Arjuna Ranathunga emphasized.
“Debts installments relevant Hambantota Port is being paid through the profit we earn from the Colombo Port.” “Hambantota Port is located in a very important place in accordance with the maritime industry. If we will be able to reduce debts on the Hambantota Port, we could consider our ability to bring an investor for the development of the Eastern terminal. “
