A suggestion for Jury Selection

Some times hollow words play an important role in the world of diplomatic exchange. Real meaning comes out slowly. Such growth of words is fundamental to understanding humanitarian law, where political figures stumble or walk tall depending on whether they should condemn or let alone, certain catastrophes.
In the recent past the decision to use the “genocide” term to describe the operations of the ‘Islamic State’ forces provides another instance of how an important, though often abused term, is used. The word’s origins were based on a method with contradictions, however brilliant it might have initially seemed.
We are told that Lemkin gave it much thought, hitting upon the idea that eliminating races had been a historically neglected facet of international criminal law. In 1946, Lemkin, writing in The American Scholar (Spring, 1946), expressed the view that “mass murder” would not be “adequate” to describe what Winston Churchill had claimed was “a crime without a name.” They all agreed that term should “connote biological destruction”; thus entered genocide.
The UN General Assembly
The UN General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide on December 9, 1948. The diplomatic tug-of-war in the discussions was themselves an object study about how problematic the use of the word would become. Reluctance to embrace its implications was everywhere.
Because all countries inherited communal clashes, as different nationality and racial groups came under geographical entity: country. Countries, in other words, were far more interested in narrowing its application than fulfilling a larger scope intended by Lemkin. The Soviet Union wished to cull the crime of its political implications; the United States feared home-grown legal insurrection by its black population over segregation and the history of slavery. The latter would only ratify the Convention in 1987 via President Ronald Reagan’s signing of the Proxmire Act at O’Hare Airport in Chicago.
Terrorist activists
Attempts to enshrine the targeting and preventing of genocide have not historically gone well, beginning with the very premise of whether one could name it or not. The copy book on punishing this particular crime has been blotted by such non-efforts in Africa, which registers customary outrage and crocodile tears among former imperial powers who only failingly intervene to rebottle the terrorist activists and pursue a relevant resource interest.
Humanitarianism is only ever donned as a necessary costume, to assuage populations back home, that wrong is being set right by moralists with weapons.
It is in this context we could look into the war crimes issue in Lanka. In a country where hundred percent Sinhala jury with a Sinhala judge give a controversial judgment, Muttetuwegama committee proposes involvement of foreign judges.
Shouldn’t we correct the mistake that is obvious before making ultra solutions? What about a jury of half Sinhala and half non Sinhala supervised by a non Sinhala judge? Or else can we start by implementing the LLRC proposals made so many years back?
