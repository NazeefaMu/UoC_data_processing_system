Government to boost public transport system

The government has decided to maintain the public transport system even at a loss for the benefit of the public, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said.
Speaking at the the initiation of a new express train service from Colombo Fort to Matale at the Colombo Fort station, the minister said that over the years, the public transport service had rendered yeoman service to the public even though incurring losses. Therefore, We have drawn up more plans to develop the public transport system, specially the railway service.
Under this programme, 160 new compartments and 20 engines would be brought to Sri Lanka under the Indian Concessionary loan scheme. We are also considering importing train engines manufactured in Europe to be deployed on the up country railway line, he said.
“We have to develop a high-speed rail system to connect major cities for the benefit of the commuters. There are those who want trains to stop at every station, while some others wish for more express trains. So we will balance all these concerns and try to provide a good train service,” the Minister de Silva said. Steps taken to transport coal by train had been more profitable and owing to this, road congestion, air pollution and accidents have been minimized,” he added. Nearly 90 trucks are used per day for the transport of coal from Trincomalee to Mahawa, which has created huge traffic congestion and air pollution. This has been brought to an end with our initiatives, he added.
