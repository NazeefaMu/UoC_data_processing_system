Is this the world’s biggest cornflake?

A student was shocked to find the world’s biggest ever cornflake in his cereal, measuring a gigantic six inches long.
Hinay Lad, 22, initially thought a piece of ceiling had fallen into his bowl of Crunchy Nut when he first saw the giant flake.
After contacting Kellogg’s to report the freak flake he was given £4 worth of vouchers to buy himself a new box of cereal.
Hinay, a healthcare student at Queen Mary University of London, had just started eating breakfast when his dad noticed the monster flake.
He said: ‘It just looked like a bit of ceiling had fallen into the box. We were like “what’s going on here?” I thought it was a bit dangerous because it could have been a choking hazard. It even looks like it could be something from outer space, a bit of meteorite or something.”
Hinay had bought the box of cereal from his local Morrisons for £2.68 and was pouring out a bowl for himself when the giant flake appeared.
He added, “It felt like a rock, if you tried bending it, it wouldn’t break. That’s why we thought it was a bit of ceiling. I wrote to Kellogg’s and their explanation was that it occurred in their plant. I’ve never seen anything like it before. They are supposed to have quality controls!”
Kellogg’s wanted Hinay, from Bradford, to send them the flake so they can study it and find out how it ended up in the packet.
A spokeswoman for the company said the lump was ‘coating and cereal particles which have collected during processing’.
She added, “Although we work hard to prevent this, it sounds like an accumulation passed the screening process and unintentionally entered the package.”
