Trinity champs at U16 ten-a-side rugby

Trinity College beat home town rivals Kingswood College by the narrow margin of two points (19-17) in extra time to win the Cup final of the 10-a-side All-Island Schools under 16 rugby championship at Trinity College rugby grounds at Pallekelle yesterday.
The winners started the match off extremely well with some good rugby. Kingswoodians too eventually got their hands on the ball, running a great line to give the Trinitians a hard time. Both schools took the match into extra time. Trinity scored one goal and two tries against one goal and a try by Kingswood.
In the Plate championship Dharmaraja College beat Science College by 7 points (a goal) to nil.
The Bowl was won by St .Joseph’s College who beat Sri Sumangala College by 19 points to 7.
In the Shield final D.S. Senanayake College beat St. Sylvester’s College by 20 points to nil.
The two-day, 10-a-side tournament was billed as the foundation for under 16 ruggerites. On the first day it was staged at two venues Pallekelle and Provincial Council grounds Digana.
Kandy rugby fans were disappointed as the tournament was not held there because of the high ground charges. The organisers had to transport the goal posts to Digana grounds, because rugby was never played there.
