New Keells Design Concept Win international awards

The latest rebranding of the Keells supermarkets was recognized with a Silver Award at the prestigious Melbourne Design Awards 2018 for the brand transformation and retail design concept conceptualized and designed by Whippet Australia and executed by the Keells team in Sri Lanka.
The rebranding project encompassed brand strategy, brand identity design, store exterior and interior design and an entire suite of in-store brand communications, including point-of-sale.
‘‘Melbourne Design Awards celebrates creative and innovative design for brand experiences and it is indeed a great achievement to be recognized with a Silver award. We are truly appreciative of the work done by Whippet to transform our stores from where it was,’’ stated Charitha Subasinghe, President – Retail John Keells Group.
In June 2018 the newly rebranded store concept also raked up a highly commended at the prestigious Drum Design awards held in London which exclusively recognizes great design concepts around the world.
The new Keells brand identity and store concept is ingrained in Keells’ belief of improving the quality of life for the nation by providing innovative experiences, quality food and fresh produce at the right price to our consumers.
Keells Attidiya was the first store to embrace the new look and with a juice bar, hot food exuding the epitome of convenience.
“By radically redesigning both the store and the brand, to reflect Keells’ focus on freshness and quality, we were able to deliver a unique world class retail experience; one that showcases the brand’s mission to bring the best of the world to Sri Lanka, every day.” said Steve Stoner, Founder and CEO of Whippet Australia.
Melbourne Design Awards is an annual event celebrating creative and innovative design intended to persuade an audience to take some action upon products, ideas or services.
The award criterion is stringent with a focus on evaluating the technical, conceptual and aesthetic elements, user experience, audience engagement and message delivery.
