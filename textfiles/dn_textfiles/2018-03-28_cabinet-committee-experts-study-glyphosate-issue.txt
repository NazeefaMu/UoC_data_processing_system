CABINET COMMITTEE OF EXPERTS TO STUDY GLYPHOSATE ISSUE

A Cabinet sub-committee which will consist of experts has been appointed to look into the use of glyphosate in the agriculture sector.
Social Empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan Heritage Minister, S.B. Dissanayake announced the above at a media briefing held at SLFP Headquarters in Darley Road yesterday.
He explained that Agriculture Minister, Duminda Dissanayake and Plantation Industries Minister, Naveen Dissanayake had submitted two cabinet papers with regard to lifting the ban.
“Some have asked that the ban be lifted as it is needed for agriculture whilst others have pointed out that there are more safer alternatives to glyphosate which can be used”, the Minister said. The President has asked the two ministers to send him names of experts so that they can be appointed to the cabinet sub-committee to study the matter.
The cabinet sub-committee is to also have inputs from Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister, Rajitha Senaratne and Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera, a strong advocate against glyphosate.
