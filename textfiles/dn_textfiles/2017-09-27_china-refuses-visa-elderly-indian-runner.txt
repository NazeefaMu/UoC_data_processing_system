China refuses visa to elderly Indian runner

NEW DELHI, Tuesday- A 101-year-old Indian runner said Tuesday that China has refused to grant her a visa to participate in the Asian Masters Athletics Championships, robbing her of a potential medal.
Man Kaur, dubbed the “miracle from Chandigarh” after winning the 100-metres gold at the World Masters Games in Auckland in April, had been training hard for the competition at home in Punjab state. “I felt very bad when my visa was rejected,” she told AFP.
“Wherever we used to go we would come back winners and even this time around I was confident of victory.
“But it's not the end of the road. I will continue training and look forward to competing in future events,” she added. – AFP
