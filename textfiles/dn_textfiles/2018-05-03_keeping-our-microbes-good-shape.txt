Keeping our microbes in good shape

Do we ever think “who we are” from a view of a scientist? We wake up, go to jobs or for studies, eat, drink, wash, sleep…etc. Normally we are busy in our day today lives. We live in this macro-world, and when we are diseased, we get medicines to be cured. We don’t care how the disease was caused instead we forget everything after we have been cured.
A scientists especially microbiologists does all above activities with millions to billions friends within and around him. These friends are the “microorganisms”, but they are not friends at all the times. If a man is rich and wealthy, everybody get close to him to get benefits, but if he is in a bad situation, all will leave. That’s the real behaviour of humans. Likewise, some microbes behave as friends when the man is in a good health, but soon become enemies when man is not good in health, but some are actual friends in their whole lifetime.
Let’s move onto our topic “Human-Micro biome”, we are all ‘humans’, and ‘Micro’ means related to microbes which we cannot see with our naked eyes. ‘Biome’ means a habitat where organisms can occur naturally. Human Micro biome is the collection of microbes that colonize the human body. Some scientists say, it is a newly discovered organ of our body, and some say it is an ecosystem. The main hotspots of micro biome in our body are, nasal cavity, oral cavity, skin, gastro-intestinal tract and urogenital tract, but even healthy individuals differ remarkably in diversity of microbes that occupy habitats in each body. Each area is dependent upon beneficial species. For an example, the gut microbes which inhabit in intestinal tract’s mucus lining, provide a protective barrier that guard intestinal wall against pathogenic bacteria, parasites, fungi, viruses and some toxins. These microbes also create antimicrobial substances which are powerful, natural antibacterial, anti-fungal and antiviral that destroys pathogenic organisms.
Although these microbes are beneficial, sometimes they cause infections when the peaceful relationship with human becomes altered. For an example, gut bacteria are necessary for maintaining intestinal wall’s health, because bacteria send signals to intestinal cells to secrete mucus and sometimes to secrete bacteria-killing molecules, but if the mucus layer gets thinner and bacteria get close to the gut wall, an immune reaction will be triggered. If more close to gut wall, inflammation becomes chronic, so it may harm our body. Therefore these organisms are beneficial as well as detrimental.
The microbiome is a complete, dynamic, ever-changing ecology, with genetic variations according to which niche in the body is being populated. For an example, on the skin alone, each bodily area has a different local microbiome, actually microhabitats. As microbes are very small, we should think small. For an example, when a typical microorganism of 3µm in length travels a distance of 3mm, it is like 2km for a human. Even more across that 3mm distance numerous chemical and physiological differences may exist that may greatly affect microbes.
Imbalance of microbiome seems to be implicated in a wide range of disorders. For example; Low diversity in the gut leads to obesity and inflammatory bowel disease, and high diversity in the vagina leads to bacterial Vaginosis. Likewise some disorders are directly linked to microbial diversity. Here ‘diversity’ means the number and abundance in distribution of microbes in human body.
If we use antibiotics to cure a disease, the gut microbial diversity get decreased up to some extent immediately, then there won’t be sufficient bacteria to digest food parts into small molecules which provide us energy. Then malnutrition can occur. Poor balance of gut microbes is associated with every digestive tract disorders as well as auto-immune conditions and psychological and behavioral issues.
Some of above mentioned facts and many more revelations began with development of the project, called Human Microbiome Project (HMP). With the modern technology, called “Genome sequencing”, this HMP targeted to find out the exact diversity and exact relationship between humans and microbes which inhabit within human body. It revealed the diversity and abundance of each habitat’s signature microbes to vary widely, with strong niche specialization both within and among individuals.
The main five hotspots were mentioned previously, and HMP analyzes every micro-habitats’ diversity within those 5 hotspots. HMP uses several techniques to sequence. Firstly it collects samples, and controls the quality. After these samples are used for 16s rRNA gene analysis via ‘454-Pyrosequencing’ method. To assess functions, it uses ‘Paired-end illumina shotgun metagenomic sequencing’ method. These analyses are based on two diversities, Alpha (a) (within sample) and Beta (ß) (samples from the same habitat among subjects). These findings led us to totally different ways to study and deal with microbes. Those microbes are a part of our body and our human genome determines the compositions of our Microbiome. So, this may pave the way for further identification of individuals such as DNA fingerprinting, and will become a better source.
