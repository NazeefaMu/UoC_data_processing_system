Two unbeaten sides vying for the league plum

The inter school Division-1 Singer league rugby title decider has finally boiled down to between the two unbeaten teams in the tournament Isipathana College and S. Thomas’ College, Mount Lavinia at CR & FC grounds, Longden Place today. Kick-off is at 4.30pm.
The two teams secured their eighth successive wins last week with Isipathana coasting to a hard fought 28-14 victory over Royal College Colombo and S. Thomas’ inflicting a second defeat on Science College Mount Lavinia, thrashing them convincingly by 31 points to nil.
This decider is also the final second round fixtures of the league tournament and it is expected to turn out to be a blockbuster with Isipathana coming with their heads high after their win against Royal and S. Thomas’ redeeming their prestige with a morale boosting win over Science.
Whatever the outcome the massive crowd that will throng to witness the game will have their money’s worth with no quarters asked or given in the ding dong battle for league supremacy.
Incidentally the way all the teams have performed in the league to-date, Isipathana stands way ahead of the rest to clinch the league title.
“Since both teams are unbeaten it’s going to be a cracker of a match,” said Isipathana head coach Nilfer Ibrahim.
“This Thomian side is different as they are a balanced unit unlike in the past. Those days they were good only in their forwards. Our loss to them in the 7’s final early in the season made us to be more determined. We’ve changed our game plans and patterns of play in the league. It has given us a huge advantage and a confidence booster,” he said.
“We have been in the finals almost every year so we know how to adjust in a big game. It’s nothing new to us but for the Thomians they have come to the league final after a lapse of 16 years, hence they will be under pressure for sure.
“We will go out there with confidence and win the prestigious league trophy and bring it back to our backyard,” said Ibrahim confidently.
Thomian head coach Tevita Tulagaese “Laga” said that he was confident of repeating their success in the inter-school Sevens and win the League title as well.
“This match with Isipathana should be a good one and the boys will go out there and play well while enjoying the game,” said the Western Samoan master tactician.
“I’m 200% certain that we have a very good opportunity to win and bring back the league crown that has eluded from us for the 16 years,” he said.
