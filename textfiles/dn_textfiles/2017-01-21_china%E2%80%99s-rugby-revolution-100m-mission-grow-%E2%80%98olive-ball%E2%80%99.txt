China’s rugby revolution: $100M mission to grow ‘olive ball’

China is making headlines with its stratospheric spending on global soccer stars but is it also undergoing a rugby revolution?
“The numbers in China are obviously mind-boggling,” World Rugby CEO Brett Gosper tells CNN. “As a nation, it's the No. 1 target not just for sport but all businesses.”
A year ago, it had 76,000 rugby players. In 2016, another 60,000 Chinese were introduced to the oval-ball sport, and officials there hope for as many as a million players in five years. In addition, a $100 million deal to market rugby in China was signed in October. Just 0.01% of its populace are involved in the game barely a drop in the sporting ocean -- but China's politicians and sporting powers are keen on a quick step to rugby hegemony.
As its population approaches 1.5 billion roughly 20% of the world's total -- it is understandable that World Rugby is leaping at the chance for the game to conquer the territory.
But is it really possible to achieve such a gargantuan rise in playing numbers in such a short space of time?
“We have a fixed objective of one million players in 10 years, but that's being readjusted by the federation to five years I believe,” Gosper says. “That's a pretty meteoric rise.”
The $100M, 10-year plan
While playing numbers alone are not enough to ensure China becomes a global force in the game, there are notably other initiatives primarily the $100 million agreed investment in the game over the next 10 years by Alisports, the sports arm of e-commerce giant Alibaba.
After the deal, Alisports chief executive Zhang Dazhong spoke of the “undoubted potential” for rugby to become a “mass-participation sport” in China, while national captain Ma Chong told the AFP news agency, “as an athlete, I finally see hope for this sport.”
The investment includes a “Get Into Rugby” initiative being set up at 10,000 universities and in schools across 20 of the country's 23 provinces.
There is also an ambitious plan to train up 30,000 coaches and 15,000 match officials in the next four years, and a push to structure a XVs competition plus a professional sevens league. Gene Tong, the regional training manager for Asia Rugby, has been in China since 2014.
He believes the sport is on the precipice of a big breakthrough in the next three years, with the 2019 Rugby World Cup and 2020 Olympics sevens tournaments to be hosted by neighbor Japan.
“It could possibly be the golden era for rugby in China, as more schools and universities are taking up the game across the whole of China and World Rugby's programs are gaining popularity and being well accepted in China,” Tong told CNN.
“Rugby in China has great potential for growth and is set to see unprecedented growth over the new few years.”
Tong acknowledges that basketball and football are much more popular in China, but points to sevens “gaining new fans” in particular.
Can China follow Japan's lead?
Sevens’ rise has had a strong effect on rugby's global growth, but Gosper -- himself a former player in both formats of the sport is planning a “dual attack” in China.
“The foundation of this great game is in XVs but sevens is obviously now an Olympic sport, which gives it huge credibility in China,” he adds. - CNN
