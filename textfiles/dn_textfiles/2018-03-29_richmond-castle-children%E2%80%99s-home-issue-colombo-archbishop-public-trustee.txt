Richmond Castle Children’s Home issue: Colombo Archbishop, Public Trustee reach amicable settlement

The case filed against the Public Trustee by the Colombo Archbishop regarding the Children’s Home maintained at the Kalutara Richmond Castle complex is due to be amicably settled with the agreement of both parties before Colombo District Judge Sujeewa Nissanka on March 29.
This protracted case pending for the last four years is to be settled due to an agreement reached by Public Trustee Sanath Weeraratne and Colombo Archbishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith to administer the children home in future by a Board of Trustees under the Public Trustees supervision in keeping with the last will of late Mudliyar Don Arthur de Silva Wijesinghe. The Archbishop of Colombo filed this case in 2014 against the Public Trustee alleging that the Childrens Home is not be administered in accordance with the last will of late Mudliyar Wijesinghe. The Richmond castle building was built in 1910 and it was vested in the Public Trustee in 1956 according to the last will of late Mudliyar Wijesinghe.
