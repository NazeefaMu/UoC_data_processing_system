GFlock launches Christmas  collection

GFlock launched its Christmas Collection recently at its flagship clothing store located in Colombo 3. Ranil Willaddarage the brainchild of GFlock and the Chief Designer for the Brand, emphasised on introducing a design line that is simple in design yet contoured the perfect fit for the modern contemporary female. Special invites representing the fashion designing industry together with GFlock priority customers attended the event.
Willaddarage, together with his partners Panduka Wanigarathna and Ranil Wasantha supported by a dynamic team equally resonate in the new collections that are released weekly – synchronisation of ideas within the team is of paramount importance whilst combining them to create contemporary designs for all moods.
Commenting on GFlock’s future expansion, Willaddarage said GFlock is making headway in the ladies clothing wear market since its inception in 2013. “GFlock has set up global online store to cater to the United Kingdom. Future plans for the brand include the launch of a mens and a kids range by mid 2018 in Sri Lanka and we hope to gradually roll it out to the UK market as well. Additionally we are also considering options in opening two more clothing stores within the Western Province which will serve as one-stop-clothing store for the entire family and an operational online store by the first quarter of 2018,” he said.
