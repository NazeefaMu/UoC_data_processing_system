Govt will not sign any FTA detrimental to local industrialists: President

President Maithripala Sirisena on Thursday said the Government would not sign any free trade agreement (FTA) which would bring injustice or challenge to the local industries and entrepreneurs.
He said some groups not related to the business sector were making the business community scared by giving them false information. “The government is getting into the free trade agreements with foreign countries only by protecting local industries,” he said.
The President was speaking at the annual Planning Award Ceremony of the Ceylon National Chamber of Industries held on Thursday at the Galadari Hotel in Colombo.
The President said the state patronage to develop local industries was not sufficiently done in the past. He said the government would implement a new programme soon to encourage and guide small and medium scale entrepreneurs.
President Sirisena said he decided to establish a national economic council to strengthen the economy by formalizing the economic management in the country.
"The NEC will increase the export income and develop the local industry," he said. He said the country has a need for a stronger programme to develop agriculture.
“The National Economic Council aims at fulfilling the government’s responsibility for the development of industries,” he said.
The Council was established after the discussions with the representatives of World Bank, International Monetary Fund, local and international economic specialists and Sri Lankan specialists working abroad.
The President requested the support from everybody for the smooth operation of the National Economic Council.
The award ceremony was organised by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce for the 16th time. The awards were conferred upon 16 micro, small, medium and large business institutions under five categories.
Litro Gas, livestock and mineral oil industries received awards for state sector industries.
Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera and Ceylon National Chamber of Industries Chairman Thissa Seneviratne were present.
