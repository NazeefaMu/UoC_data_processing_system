Enterprise Sri Lanka an initiative to empower the nation: Siyambalapitiya

Had significant initiatives been taken by preceding governments, the country could have been heaven by now, Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.
He said that yet, none of them were implemented properly to empower the public.
"But Enterprise Sri Lanka initiated by the Good Governance Government is not just a loan scheme, but an initiative to empower and provide facilities to entrepreneurs," he said.
The minister was addressing a ceremony held to grant loans to underprivileged clients of the People's Bank and Bank of Ceylon branches in Rambukkana, to develop their enterprises.
Minister Siyambalapitiya said,"The governments elected in the country after its Independence, introduced projects not to put the country in the labyrinth of chaos. However, had they had been properly implemented for at least five years, the country could have benefited."
Enterprise Sri Lanka would be implemented in parallel to the
Gamperaliya programme, he said, "This would empower the courageous. The world moves forward because of courageous people."
Minister Siyambalapitiya said, "We always take risks to help the nation as it is our responsibility as the government."
He said that one of the main issues faced by entrepreneurs, was obtaining loans from banks.
"They require lands as collateral," the minister said, "But today, the issue is that there are only 20 percent of clear deeds in the country."
Minister Siyambalapitiya said that the interest rate of the Enterprise Sri Lanka loan scheme was low, and that it was designed for everyone, from three-wheelers driver to graduates.
