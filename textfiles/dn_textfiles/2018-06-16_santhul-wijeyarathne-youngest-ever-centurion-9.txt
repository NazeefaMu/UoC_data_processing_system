Santhul Wijeyarathne youngest ever centurion at 9

Nine-year-old Santhul Wijeyarathne became the youngest member of the Sanath Jayasuriya Cricket Academy to ever score a century, with an unbeaten 100 in their victory over Colts Cricket Club in an Under-12 Limited Overs match played at St. Thomas’ College, Kotte.
The young left hand batsman notched his unbeaten century studded with 16 scintillating boundaries. It was an all-round performance by Santhul, a student of Nalanda College, Colombo, who dazzled with the ball earlier in the day and snapped up three wickets, with his teammate Sandul also taking 3 wickets, helped by Rachintha de Silva with 2 wickets and Dimath and Lelum who bagged a wicket each. Arosha (39) and Nihandu (32) were the top scorers for Colts who scored 133 in 30 overs.
Santhul and Rachintha de Silva (24) then opened the inning for the Sanath Jayasuriya Cricket Academy with a stand of 71. Anchored by Santhul’s sparkling century, the Sanath Jayasuriya Cricket Academy easily overhauled Colts Cricket Club’s total with six wickets to spare.
