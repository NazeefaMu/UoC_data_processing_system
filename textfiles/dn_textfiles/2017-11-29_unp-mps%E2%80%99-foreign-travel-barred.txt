UNP MPs’ foreign travel barred

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has informed all UNP Ministers and MPs that they would not be allowed to undertake any foreign trips until the Budget debate voting concludes.
The budget debate concludes with the third reading vote on December 9.
They will not be allowed to go abroad during this period, even to honour previous official invitations received by them.
The Prime Minister issued this directive at the UNP Parliamentary Group meeting held at the Kotte Parliamentary Complex on November 27.
