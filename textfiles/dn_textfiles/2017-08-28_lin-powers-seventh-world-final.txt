Lin powers into seventh world final

GLASGOW, Saturday – Lin Dan stayed on course for a record sixth men's singles title at the badminton world championships with a stunning semi-final victory over top seed Son Wan-Ho in Glasgow on Saturday.
Lin, who last won the title in 2013, defeated Son 21-17, 21-14 to reach his seventh world final.
In the gold-medal decider the Chinese star will face Denmark's Viktor Axelsen.
Lin, 33, may have reached the latter stages of his career, but he outsmarted the 29-year-old world number one from South Korea.
A run of five points in a row from 16-15 down helped seal the first game and he pressed home his advantage midway through the second.
“Everyone is talking about my age, but I have proved I can still play at a high level,” he said. “Men's singles is very tough these days, it is a very hard route to the final. “I always feel nervous before big matches, but I am very happy that I have had great support here. “I watched Viktor's semi-final and he's playing very well. Tomorrow is the last match and I will be giving 1000 percent.” - AFP
