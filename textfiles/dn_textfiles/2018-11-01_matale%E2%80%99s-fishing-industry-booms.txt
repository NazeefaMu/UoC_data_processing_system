Matale’s fishing industry booms

Matale's fishing industry had taken a turn for the better as more fish were being caught. Furthermore, freshwater fish prices had spiked from Rs.300 to Rs.400 per kilogram. The majority of consumers purchase freshwater fish, fishermen said, adding that the saltwater fishing industry was dwindling.
More fresh water fish were being bred in large and medium-scale reservoirs, with over 3,000 fishermen taking part in it, fishermen added.
However, the government had so far not paid enough attention to improve the industry, they added.
