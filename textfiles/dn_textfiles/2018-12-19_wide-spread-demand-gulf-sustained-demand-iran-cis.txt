WEEKLY TEA REVIEW  ENDING 12TH DEC. 2018
WIDE-SPREAD DEMAND FROM GULF, SUSTAINED DEMAND FROM IRAN, CIS

There was good demand for teas on offer with fairly wide-spread demand from Saudi-Arabia, Kuwait, Syria, Libya, Iraq and the U.A.E. There was also sustained demand from buyers for Turkey and the C.I.S whilst demand from Iran, was once again subdued.
The stronger demand that prevailed at the commencement of the Ex Estate sale lost steam halfway through the brokers order of sale, perhaps due to the news that the stoppage of work on high grown estates will cease from last week, Lanka Commodity Brokers Ltd Director Jehan Algama told Daily News Business.
There was added interest for the best available teas as buyers possibly wanted to cover their orders fearing a short fall which was likely in the wake of last week’s plantations strike, he said.
Meanwhile, Asia Siyaka Commodities PLC Senior Vice President Sohan Samaranayake said that last week’s auctions comprised 7 Million kilos. Low Grown Leafy teas accounted for 1.8 Million kilos whilst Tippy/Small Leaf catalogue had 1.1 Million kilos.

IRAQ KEEN ON RESUMING TEA IMPORTS FROM INDIA
KOLKATA: Iraq is keen to resume import of orthodox teas from India, eight years after the trade came to an abrupt halt owing to the geopolitical tension in the West Asian country.
A delegation from the Trade Promotion Council of India found this out on a recent trip to Iraq. “We had gone to four places – Baghdad, Karbala, Najaf and Erbil. Buyer-seller meetings were organised and we found that importers were keen to know about Indian tea,” SujitPatra, Secretary, Indian Tea Association, who was part of the delegation, said.
There has been a shift in purchasing pattern in Iraq, he said. Earlier, the government used to buy teas, but now private parties are involved in the purchase.
After India stopped tea exports to Iraq, Sri Lanka and Vietnam filled the void. Iraq imports around 40 million kg of teas a year and Sri Lanka dominates the market with 80 per cent share. India will, therefore, have to compete with Sri Lanka which is exporting orthodox teas at an average price of $2 per kg. Patra, however said that during his interaction with importers in Iraq he felt that they were willing to pay a bit more for good quality teas. India exports orthodox teas to Iran, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Germany, US and Japan, among other countries. Indian tea industry is looking to increase exports of orthodox teas as the returns are better on this variety. India produces 110-120 million kg a year and it has the capability of producing more orthodox teas.
Exports have remained flat in 2018 because of uncertainty in Iran in the aftermath of US sanctions. Orthodox tea exports slowed down, though, and the average price of orthodox teas fell to Rs 210.87 per kg this year from Rs 221.29 per kg in 2017 largely because of the decline in shipments to Iran. In the first nine months of 2018, India exported 173.80 million kg of tea, slightly higher than 173.52 million kg exported in the year-ago period. (Economic Times of India)
