After AB de Villiers’ 360-degree batting:
A bowler comes up with 360-degree bowling run-up

Cricket has become a batsman’s game over the years and it has become paramount for the bowlers to churn out variations in order to curb the batsmen from unleashing their range of strokes on the cricket pitch. Recently, a spinner from Botswana by the name of Mmoloki Mooketsi came up with an action where he took a couple of small steps before sending down the ball.
The world has also been a witness to some indifferent action at the international circuit. Former South Africa spinner Paul Adams used to twist his entire body while bowling. A decade ago, Sri Lankan fast bowler introduced a delivery where the ball was delivered from a side angle owing to which it was difficult for any new batsmen to read him in the initial stages.
Even the current Indian team has Jasprit Bumrah, who doesn’t have a conventional bowling action. Recently, another such bowling action hit the scenes. In a domestic match in India, a left-arm spinner turned his entire body around while bowling. From the video, it seemed as if he’s a fan of the Proteas great AB de Villiers, who is popularly known as Mr. 360 degree.
Also, it was surprising how despite having the peculiar action, he bowled it with sheer accuracy. The leather pitched on and around the middle and leg stump and the batsmen made a forward push to pat the red cherry straight to the short leg fielder. This happened on day three of an under-23 CK Nayudu Trophy match between Bengal and Uttar Pradesh in Kalyania, near Kolkata, where UP’s left-arm spinner Shiva Singh sent social media into meltdown. Singh, who was part of India’s U-19 World Cup-winning team last year, completed a 360-degree turn while bowling his delivery, leaving the on-field umpire Vinod Seshan declare the ball dead.
The wicketkeeper and the close-in fielders came towards the umpire to get more clarity on the reasons behind its illegitimacy.
The umpire remained unfazed and clearly suggested to the bowler that such an action isn’t permitted. Moreover, he also asked the players to carry on with the game.
MCC’S VERDICT
Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which lays downs rules for international cricket worldwide, was asked to deliver its verdict on whether the ball can be deemed legal or not.
According to the law published in the Lord’s website on Thursday, it does not dictate what a bowler’s run-up should look like.
It states:
Under Law 21.1, the bowler must state his/her mode of delivery, which seems to have been left arm round the wicket in this case, but does not state how conventional the bowler’s approach should be.
Law 41.4 states:
41.4.1 It is unfair for any fielder deliberately to attempt to distract the striker while he/she is preparing to receive or receiving a delivery.
41.4.2 If either umpire considers that any action by a fielder is such an attempt, he/she shall immediately call and signal Dead ball and inform the other umpire of the reason for the call.
The law only states if an offence is made to distract the batsman, rather than the batter actually getting distracted. Another point made by the law is for the umpire to decide if he felt the action was done in order to distract the striker.
The law goes on to add that only if 360-degree twirl should be part of the bowler’s run-up for every delivery, then can the umpire step in to deem if the action was done to distract the batsman.
If the batsman is distracted, he can withdraw from his stance and if the umpire does feel that the bowler’s action was done purposefully to distract the batsman, then Law 41.1 will be followed and a penalty of five runs is awarded. - cricketcountry
