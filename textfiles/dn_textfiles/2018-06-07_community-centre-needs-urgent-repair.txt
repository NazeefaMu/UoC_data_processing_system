Community centre needs urgent repair

The children’s park and community centre situated at Meelath Nagar in the Addalaichenai Divisional Secretariat Division is in a severe state of deterioration and neglect due to the apathy of officials.
This children’s park and community centre falls under the purview of the Addalaichenai Pradeshiya Sabha.
This children’s park and community centre that was built at Meelath Nagar in the Addalaichenai DS Division in year 1997 to mark the National Meelath Celebration development project, has not been repaired for a long time.
The community centre is in a very parlous condition without proper maintenance. Scrub Jungle and grassy weeds have grown around the centre. The boundary fence is also damaged.
People in the area are perturbed over this neglect and wastage of this community centre which must be re-opened for people use. The people are very much worried about the present condition of the community centre. They urge the authorities to provide a quick solution to this matter.
