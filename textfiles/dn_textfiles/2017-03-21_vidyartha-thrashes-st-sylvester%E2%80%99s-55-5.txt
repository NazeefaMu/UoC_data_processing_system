Vidyartha thrashes St. Sylvester’s 55-5

Vidyartha Colllege, Kandy earned a good victory over St. Sylvester’s College beating the latter by 55 points (6 goals , 2 tries and a penalty ) to 5 (1 try) at the Nittawela ground in their inter school rugby match and walked away with the Banda - Nillagoda Memorial Cup. At half time winners led 27-00.
The Banda - Nillagoda Memorial Cup is a six-game series between the two schools and this year Vidyartha has won all six games to bag the trophy.
This is St. Sylvester’s second defeat in the season as they have been already beaten by Kingswood College two weeks ago.
Vidyartha fared well so far this season winning all three matches played against Ananda, Maliyadeva and this time arch rivals St. Sylvester’s. Old Vidyarthian Rangith Weerasinghe was the chief guest at the award ceremony. In this game Vidyartha lads who are under the watchful eyes of Anil Jayasnghe displayed some superb brand of rugby to crush Sylvestrians.
This defeat will cause more misery on the embattled Sylverstains who in the past two weeks have suffered their heaviest home losses at the hands of Kingswood and Vidyartha.
Referee – Ajith Bandara
