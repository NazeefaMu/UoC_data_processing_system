Commission reports give strength to Sri Lanka?
Major contradictions in "Rise with Geneva"

There is a predictable cyclical gathering of the anti-government groups within the UPFA with the approach of any elections in the country. This is now seen in efforts to raise a new political alliance of the minor constituent parties of the UPFA, with the approach of the next round of Local Government elections, and their hope of a section of the SLFP supporting them.
There is hardly any consensus on policy among these allies of discord, other than the hope of getting the twice defeated Mahinda Rajapaksa to lead them once again, in the desperation to avoid a humiliating defeat at local polls. The current indications are that with these polls being delayed due to finalizing of the delimitation process, the SLFP would be in a stronger position to do without its so-called allies in the UPFA, while the UNP retains its own strength and political image without any damage, similar to what the SLFP (within the UPFA) suffered on August 17. The current rise in the probes on corruption and fraud during the past regime, and the increased success seen in police action on major crimes during that period, especially political murders, indicate that the hopes these groups keep fanning of a Mahinda Rajapaksa leadership would be distant from reality.
"Rise with Geneva"
These political groups now moving to the fringes of isolation have no common policy other than that of necessary survival. The majority of them, with the lead given by Wimal Weerawansa's National Freed Front, Dinesh Gunawardena's Mahajana Eksath Peramuna and Udaya Gammanpila's Pivithuru Hela Urumaya have a clearly racist agenda. Their other allies on what is left of the left today, such as the remnants of the LSSP led by Tissa Vitharana, the remainder of the Communist Party led by DEW Gunasekara and the Democratic Left Front led by Vasudeva Nanayakkara, have abandoned whatever socialist or social democratic thinking they once had, and are only carrying on with the slogan of anti-US and Western imperialism.
In this situation, it is inevitable that these forces of defeat that pledged to "Rise with Mahinda" after January 8 and the run up to the August 17 General Election, now see an opportunity for a "Rise with Geneva". With Sri Lanka co-sponsorship the latest UNHRC resolution on this country, the message they will take to the people is that this co-sponsorship has placed Sri Lanka in great difficulty to ensure good independent investigations into any changes this country may have to face, with regard to events at the end of the war against the LTTE, and events that took place before and after that.
Earlier this week we saw the addition of a religious aspect to this campaign of desperation with the appeal made to religious leaders by GL Peiris, who had been more in the background after the two Rajapaksa defeats. His message was of the country being in such danger that there was an essential role for its religious leaders to play to save the country. The effort to whip up public feeling against the Geneva Resolution, and what will have to be done to implement it, is moving in a trajectory that attempts to show that the necessary legal and judicial actions could not be taken by Parliament alone, and that these would need constitutional amendments, which would require approval by a referendum. This is the angle that will be carried out with the intensity that could be gathered by these groups of desperation, in the coming weeks and months.
The Government must take note of these trends seeking to push the country back to a period of racial, religious and communal strife, and move away from the promise to the country and the world of peace, reconciliation, accountability and development. It will also require displaying agreement, especially among Cabinet Ministers on policies or actions taken by the government. The absence of this could only help support the divisive efforts of the UPFA groups in their struggle for survival. There is also the need for more caution regarding matters such as appointments to key positions in the administration and the state sector to prevent any impression of a rush back to the days of nepotism, even in a scope much more limited than the days of Rajapaksa.
Two Commission reports
To those seeking to "Rise with Geneva", a very good response has come from the reports of the two important commissions tabled in Parliament by the Prime Minister on Tuesday. The Paranagama Commission on Missing Persons and the older Udalagama Commission on allegations of major breach of the law by security forces personnel, show very good cause for the issues raised about Sri Lanka in the UNHRC report, and the need for proper action on accountability, as well as punishment where necessary, in keeping with the laws of our own land, apart from that of the impact of our policies on the world outside.
We are all glad that the Paranagama Commission has debunked the Darusman Report's findings of more than 40,000 civilians killed in the last stages of the war against the LTTE, and other aspects of that report not based on proper investigation. There is also the recognition that the majority of the Tamil civilian casualties in the final 12 hours of the conflict was caused by the LTTE.
Yet, those who seek to "Rise with Geneva" should also bear in mind that the Paranagama Commission, appointed by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, which had the assistance of foreign personnel too, has not given a completely clean sheet to Sri Lanka. Among its key observations is: "There are credible allegations which, if proved to the required standard, may show that some members of the armed forces committed acts during the final phase of the war that amounted to war crimes giving rise to individual criminal responsibility". The commission has called for an independent judicial investigation into war crimes allegations, and also proposed to set up a separate war crimes division within the Sri Lankan legal system.
This is not very far from the call for a domestic mechanism, with foreign assistance, that Sri Lanka has supported by co-sponsoring the Geneva Resolution last month.
The Udalagama Commission on several alleged actions of violence by the police and armed services, which submitted its report on some of the matters submitted for inquiry, which related to matters after August 1, 2006, (and which report was never revealed by the previous Government), also makes very strong observations on matters of local and international, importance. Due to the confines of space, I will be brief on the observations of the Commission. On investigations into the killing of 17 aid workers, which caused concern both in Sri Lanka and abroad, it says that the manner in which the Police conducted the initial investigation into these killings in early August 2006 lacked professionalism.
The Commission also probed the deaths of 61 persons in Naddamottankulam (Senchoali) in August 2006, the alleged execution at Welikanda of 14 persons from Muttur, while being transported in ambulances, the killing of 10 Muslim villagers at Redalla and the killing of five youth in Trincomalee. Out of 16 cases it was able to conclude proceedings only in seven cases. It is the view of the Udalagama Commission that it is necessary to incorporate a comprehensive component of human rights and international humanitarian law in all police and armed forces training schemes.
Our capabilities
The complete reports of the Udalagama and Paranagama Commissions do show that Sri Lanka does have capable personnel, with necessary knowledge of law and its application, to probe into any allegations. But the refusal of the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime to release these reports did cause a very bad slur on the image of the country, which led to the understanding that had to be reached in Geneva this year.
This should remind those hoping for a "Rise with Geneva" to understand the consequences of refusing to work together with the international community, especially the United Nations, and also to cock-a-hoop to the views of those who can be critical of this country and its policies. These reports show the absence of any possibility to bring the Heroes of Battle to trial, as the Geneva Risers say, except those in the forces who may have violated the law, and therefore fail to be heroes.
In a strange sequence of events, the UPFA opponents of the Geneva Resolution are joined by Jayalalithaa and Vaiko, in Tamil Nadu, who oppose it on racist grounds, and call for an international investigation, and not the foreign assisted domestic mechanism that has been agreed on. It is certainly a political puzzle as to how the racist elements here who oppose Geneva as being pro-Tamil, can agree with the Tamil Nadu leaders who think it is not pro-Tamil, and how the former leftists can stand in the midst of the contradiction. Yet, such contradiction is obviously the way to "Rise with Geneva" today.
