Chinese Communist Party praises govt’s anti-corruption drive

The Chinese Communist Party praised Sri Lanka’s new government’s drive against corruption and expressed its willingness to help in this process.
Chinese Vice Minister of the International Department of the Communist Party of China, Chen Fengxiang made these remarks when he met with a Sri Lankan delegation headed by Additional Secretary to the Prime Minister Saman Athaudahetti.
On the request of Additional Secretary to the Prime Minister Saman Athaudahetti, Chinese authorities agreed to provide specialized training to Lankan officials engaged in anti corruption investigations.
The Sri Lankan delegation expressed their satisfaction over the anti corruption drive initiated by Chinese President Xi Jinping and both were engaged in a lengthy conversation about this programme.
Chinese Vice Minister of the International Department of the Communist Party of China, Chen Feng Xiang paid his gratitude to UNP Leader and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe for maintaining a close and cordial relationship with the Chinese Communist Party for a long time and stressed the importance of further enhancing the ties.
The fact that Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang was among the first to congratulate Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe after he became Prime Minister by winning the General election, shows the respect and friendship that the Chinese government accords to the Prime Minister. He said that China considers the UNP as one of the leading forces in Sri Lankan politics.
During talks, Additional Secretary Athaudahetti said China and Sri Lanka entered in to their first bilateral agreement, the Sino- Lanka Agreement on Rubber-Rice exports in 1952 during the UNP regime, while formal diplomatic relations between the two countries were established in 1957 during the SLFP regime. The UNP and SLFP have had close links with China despite external influences and pressures. Hence, a situation will be created for an even better relationship with China through a combined UNP, SLFP Government.
