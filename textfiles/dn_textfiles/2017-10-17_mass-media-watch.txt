Mass media on watch

The mass media has become an essential element in our life just like food and clothing. With the advancement of technology, media has now taken over a significant role in strengthening the society. In fact, this very same media could be considered a mirror of the society.
Why is the Media Important? It gets your message across to a wider audience. The media has the capacity to trade and market the products as well as the prejudice.
Though it is claimed to be governed by righteousness and equity, the media is now overcome with greed, self- aggrandisement and poisoned virtues.
It is common knowledge that the media is in charge of information, education, entertainment, advertising and correlation of parts of society. The society is influenced by media in so many ways. It is the media for the masses that helps them get information about myriads of things.
It helps people form opinions and make judgements regarding various issues. It is the media which keeps the people updated and informed about what is happening around them and the world.
The teenagers and children wish to follow the people, who get recognised in the media and follow them to get noticed.
Sometimes, they focus on the negative aspects of the media. A considerable portion of the population has succumbed to a life of crime!
The media affects the people’s perspective. Too much intervention of media in everything is a matter of concern. The media can be considered watchdog of political democracy. Through the ages, the emphasis of media on news has camouflaged.
No doubt, media has played a significant role in making the world a global village and to reduce the communication gaps among the people living in the far areas. But unfortunately, media these days have become a commercialised sector. Their ultimate goal is bagging the rating points.
I fervently hope that the media identifies its responsibility and work sincerely and honestly. Then it will serve as a great force in building the nation.
