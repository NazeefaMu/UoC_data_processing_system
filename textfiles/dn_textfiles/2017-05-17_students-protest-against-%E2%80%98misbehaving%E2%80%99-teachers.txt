Students protest against ‘misbehaving’ teachers

Students of Ramakrishna Vidyalaya, Kokkaddichcholai staged a protest at the entrance of the school, yesterday alleging that teachers are ‘misbehaving’ with children. They said complaints made to the Principal are in vain.
They alleged that two teachers in particular should be legally dealt with due to photographs of certain students being posted by them on social media.
Kokkaddichcholai Police who met the students said they will inquire into the allegation.
Manmunai South West Divisional Education Director N. Thayaseelan requested the students to give their demands in writing so that he could take further action.
