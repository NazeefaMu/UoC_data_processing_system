'Nearly Rs.5,000 mn required for Yan Oya compensation payment'

Yan Oya Reservoir Projects Deputy Project Director Engineer Palitha Wickramatilake said that nearly Rs.5,000 million is required as compensation payment for lands acquired for the construction of the reservoir.
Wickramatilake was referring to a recent protest launched by the destitute families demanding compensation and alternative paddy lands for their livelihood empowerment.
"Now the process of filling the Yan Oya reservoir is in progress.
The reservoirs capacity is 149,000 a.f. and government ran invested investing Rs.36,000 million for the completion of the project. Of the 10,000 acres of land covering the project, 6,000 acres are from government reservations while the balance has been through land acquisition from the people," he said.
