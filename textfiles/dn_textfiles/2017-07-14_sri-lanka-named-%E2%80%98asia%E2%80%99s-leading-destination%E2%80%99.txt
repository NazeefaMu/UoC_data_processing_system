Sri Lanka named ‘Asia’s Leading Destination’

Sri Lanka Tourism clinched two prestigious awards at the World Travel Awards Ceremony held in the Maldives last week.
Competing among 47 countries in Asia, Sri Lanka bagged the awards for ‘Asia’s Leading Destination’ and ‘Asia’s Leading Adventure Tourism Destination.’
The awards were received by Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau (SLTPB) Managing Director Sutheash Balasubramanium and Director Marketing Madhubani Perera.
An elated Minister of Tourism Development John Amaratunga noted that these awards were important milestones in Sri Lanka’s tourism promotional efforts.
“Securing these two top accolades at the prestigious World Travel Awards Ceremony will continue to draw the spotlight on Destination Sri Lanka. The awards have confirmed Sri Lanka’s preeminent position as Asia’s Leading Destination while also consolidating its newly acquired status of Asia’s Leading Adventure Tourism Destination,” he said.
Meanwhile following an invitation extended by Sri Lanka Tourism, the World Travel Awards Executive Committee has agreed to explore the possibility of hosting the gala ceremony in Sri Lanka in 2019. Sri Lanka Tourism also used the opportunity to showcase the island’s tourism attractions through a video presentation to the high profile audience representing the region’s leading destinations.
Among the attendees at the gala event were Chairman and Founder of World Travel Awards, Graham Cooke and Maldivian Minister of Tourism Hussain Lirar.
In addition to Sri Lanka Tourism, many local hotels, airlines and travel companies also won various awards at the event. They include SriLankan Airlines which was selected as ‘Asia’s Leading Airline in the Indian Ocean’ and ‘Asia’s Leading Cultural Airline’, Casa Colombo as ‘Asia’s Leading Design Hotel’, Hilton Colombo as ‘Sri Lanka’s Leading Business Hotel’.
