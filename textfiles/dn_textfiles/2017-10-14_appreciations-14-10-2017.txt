Adhil Bakeer Markar
nation lost a young leader
We commemorate Adhil Bakeer Markar’s first death anniversary. Adhil’s sudden demise in London last year in October shocked not only his family - the whole nation shared their grievances with his family expressing sympathies, condolences and visiting his family members.
Adhil represented a prominent political family from ‘Hakeem Villa’ in Beruwala. He was the fourth son of veteran politician and a former Cabinet Minister Imtiaz Bakeer Markar and grandson of the late Deshamanya Al.Haj Mohamed Abdul Bakeer Markar, who served the country being in different portfolios; as a Speaker of Parliament of Sri Lanka, Cabinet Minister and Southern Province Governor. Adhil obtained his primary education at the Royal College, Colombo and completed his Advanced Level at the Asian International School in Colombo. He successfully completed his Bachelor of Laws from the University of London and entered the Sri Lanka Law College where he passed out as an Attorney–at–Law.
He was a director at the National Youth Services Council, Economic Affairs Ministry and Policy Planning. Adhil represented Sri Lanka at the 68th United Nations General Assembly in 2014 being an official Sri Lankan Youth Delegate to the United Nations. He delivered a passionate speech at the United Nations General Assembly urging the island’s youth to build bridges between their communities.He came to London to complete his Masters in Comparative Politics at The London School of Economics and Political Science on a Chevening Scholarship, a prestigious award, which designed for future leaders funded by the UK’s Foreign and Commonwealth Office. After his unexpected death, the London School of Economics (LSE) especially set up a blog for his friends to leave memories and messages of sympathy.
The Evening Standard newspaper in London reported his sudden death saying ‘Mr. Bakeer Markar had been tipped as a future head of his nation’.
Adhil belonged to an illustrious political family immortalised in the history of Sri Lankan Parliament for reasons of their honesty and integrity in politics. Sri Lanka lost one of talented young future leaders and academics. May the Almighty Allah grant him the highest place in Jannah.
