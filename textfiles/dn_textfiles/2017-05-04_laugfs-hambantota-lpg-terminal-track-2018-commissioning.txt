Laugfs Hambantota LPG Terminal on track for 2018 commissioning

The Laugfs LPG Import and Export Terminal in Hambantota, the first phase with a 30,000 MT capacity is progressing on schedule to be commissioned by first half of 2018 financial year as planned.
Built with an investment of US$ 80 million, the Laugfs Terminal is set to be one of the largest LPG Import and Export Terminals in its class in South Asia. It was the first and the largest investment in Sri Lanka’s Hambantota Port, which is known for its strategic nautical location in the Indian Ocean.
“The new LPG terminal will reinforce our energy presence within the region by tapping the energy requirements of some of the largest emerging LPG markets, including India, Bangladesh and Myanmar.
The Hambantota Port provides a strategic advantage to further strengthen this position given its location amidst some of the world’s largest nautical/shipping routes. Combined with these strategic advantages, we believe our own Laugfs Terminal will help position Sri Lanka as a break-bulking hub of the region, yielding tremendous economic benefits to the country,” Laugfs Group Chairman, W.K.H.Wegapitiya said.
Laugfs Group Managing Director Thilak De Silva said it will create many direct and indirect employment opportunities and will be a lucrative foreign exchange generation avenue for the country.
