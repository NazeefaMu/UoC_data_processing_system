Scotland stun top-ranked England by six runs in ODI upset

Edinburgh, Sunday : Scotland beat England by six runs to record the greatest win in their cricket history as they held their nerve in a lone one-day international at Edinburgh on Sunday.
Calum MacLeod’s superb 140 not out powered non-Test nation Scotland to a record 371 for five against an England side who are top of the one-day international rankings.
It looked as if England would win while Jonny Bairstow was making 105 but they suffered a middle-order collapse and the match ended with seven balls remaining when Scotland paceman Saf Sharif had England No 11 Mark Wood plumb lbw to seal a famous victory.
The win came in Scotland’s first match since they agonisingly just missed out on qualification for the 2019 World Cup in Zimbabwe in March. AFP
