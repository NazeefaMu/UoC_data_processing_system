General Election only way out of the crisis - GL

The Attorney General has already made a request from the Supreme Court to appoint a full Bench to hear the case in connection with the gazette notification issued by the President dissolving Parliament, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Chairman Prof. G.L.Peiris said.
Addressing a press conference at the SLPP Head Quarters in Battaramulla yesterday, he said that he made a request from the Supreme Court to appoint more than three judges to hear the case. The entire country will get to know the decision of the Supreme Court on December 7. The Supreme Court only issued a Stay Order and it is not the final judgement of the Supreme Court.
The UNP tries its best to mislead the public by stating that it is the final decision of the Supreme Court which is not.
According to Prof. Peiris, no political party in Parliament has the majority and the Government has 103 and the UNP has 101. The JVP said it will not vote to appoint the UNP Leader as the Prime Minister. The TNA has not declared that it will vote to appoint the former Prime Minister as the PM again.“This type of Parliament is useless because it cannot function. The people have the sovereignty. The people should be allowed to use the universal franchise and elect a new Parliament according to their choice,” the SLPP Chairman said.
Prof. Peiris pointed out that since no political party has 113 seats, the best option is holding a General Election. There are no many choices to solve this issue. The Speaker has pushed this country to anarchy because he favours the UNP and his family ties with the party.
