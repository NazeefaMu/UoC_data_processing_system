Hawker fined

Panadura Chief Magistrate Chandana Liyanage imposed a fine of Rs. 5,000 on a pavement hawker who pleaded guilty to a charge of obstructing the entrance to the Panadura SLTB Central Bus Stand.
The suspect, H.F. Sugith Fonseka, who sold vegetables there, was arrested by the Panadura Police and produced in court by Sergeant Ananda of the Panadura South Police, on September 20.
Last week, police with the assistance of the employees of the Panadura Urban Council warned pavement hawkers not to engage in hawking at the premises of the Panadura SLTB Central Bus Stand, but once again they began selling vegetables, obstructing the entrance to the bus stand.
