Legal barriers for Hambantota roads rehabilitation

Rehabilitating rural roads under several local government institutes in the Hambantota district posses a serious problem since excavating gravels for them raises legal issues, Housing and Constructions Minister Sajith Premadasa said at a Hambantota District Coordinating Committee meeting recently.
Rehabilitation work of roads in the Tissamaharama D.S. Divisions, Lunugamvehera, and Suriyawewa areas had come to a standstill even though the funds for them had been allocated, since locations to excavate gravel could not be found due to legal issues. Local Government institution secretaries said suitable places to excavate gravel are in wildlife conservation zones and forest reserves, but those authorities would not permit to excavate gravels.
Minister Premadasa requested these institutions to issue permissions to excavate gravel for road rehabilitation work.
