GMOA braces for another strike on new SAITM - KDU Act

The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) will launch an islandwide strike at any moment, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA headquarters yesterday, he said the decision was made during the special Central Committee Meeting held yesterday prior to the press conference. The Executive Committee of the GMOA was given power to decide the dates of the strike.
Dr. Aluthge said it was decided to do everything possible against the proposed 'Sir John Kothalawala Defence University Act (draft of 2017)’ to be brought to Parliament soon. The public will be made aware of the dangerous consequences of the proposed new SAITM-KDU Act which will totally destroy the quality of the medical education.
The GMOA will fully support the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) to defeat all efforts made by the Health Minister to destroy SLMC's independence. "Health authorities must immediately revise doctor allowances and solve issues related to grade promotions," he said. Trade union action will be taken against the Free Trade Agreement signed with Singapore, ETCA to be signed with India and the new Inland Revenue Act and the tax policy implemented with it, he added.
