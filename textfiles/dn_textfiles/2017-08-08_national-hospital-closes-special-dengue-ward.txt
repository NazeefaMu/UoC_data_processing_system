National Hospital closes special dengue ward

 
The National Hospital of Sri Lanka has closed down the special dengue ward today due to the decrease in the number of dengue patients.
Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said however that dengue eradication campaigns would continue across the island. 
The National Hospital increased its surge capacity and allocated a cubicle with eight beds from each ward exclusively for dengue patients with the recent massive outbreak of the dengue virus.
