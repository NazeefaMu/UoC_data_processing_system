Another Lankan  fast bowler  returns home  injured

 
Sri Lanka suffered another injury blow to one of their fast bowlers when 24-year-old Dushmantha Chameera was ruled out of the tour of England with a back injury.
A media release from Sri Lanka Cricket states that Chameera sustained an injury to his lower back and will be returning to Colombo for further treatment.
Chameera underwent an MRI/CT scan this morning, which has indicated a stress fracture to his lower back, and medical recommendation is treatment and rest for as long as four months, the release states.
Chameera, the quickest of the Sri Lankan bowlers currently on tour of England took three wickets for 64 including the wicket of Jonny Bairstow who top scored with 140 in the first Test at Leeds which Sri Lanka lost by an innings and 88 runs.
Chameera is the second casualty the Lankan team has suffered on the tour. Last week the spearhead of the fast bowling attack Dhammika Prasad was forced to return home after injuring his shoulder. Prasad at present is undergoing treatment.
Prasad was replaced by batsman/wicket-keeper Kusal Perera.
A replacement for Chameera will be named shortly.
