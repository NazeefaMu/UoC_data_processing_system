‘Frugal Innovation’ guru to speak at Chamber business strategy event

An award-winning author, and expert in international business, marketing and innovation will be the headline speaker at the ‘Future of Business’ event organized by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce.
Jaideep Prabu, Professor of Business and Enterprise at Cambridge University’s Judge Business School, is set to speak on ‘How to do more (and better) with less’, providing practical lessons for Sri Lankan business leaders.
Jaideep is the co-author of two critically acclaimed books, ‘Frugal Innovation’ and ‘Jugaad Innovation’ that introduced new thinking on how small and large businesses alike can transform through innovation.
In 2016, ‘Frugal Innovation’ won the Chartered Management Institute's (CMI) Management Book of the Year Award.
Through his research and consulting work, Jaideep has gained unique insights relevant for business, which he will be sharing one-on-one with the participants at the Chamber event on March 24.
His research on the role of firm culture in driving innovation in firms; how multinational firms organize their innovation activities; and innovation in emerging markets have been published in international journals.
