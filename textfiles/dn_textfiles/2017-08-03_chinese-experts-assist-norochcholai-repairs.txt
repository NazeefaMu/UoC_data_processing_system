Chinese experts to assist in Norochcholai  repairs

 
The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) said that a Chinese team of technology experts had arrived in Sri Lanka to assist the renovation and repair of the third generator of the Norochcholai coal power plant.
The electricity supply to several parts of the island was disrupted due to the breakdown of the 300 megawatt generator on July 26.
