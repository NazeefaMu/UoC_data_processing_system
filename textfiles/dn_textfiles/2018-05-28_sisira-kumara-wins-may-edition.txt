UTE Engineering Pin Fernando Grand Prix
Sisira Kumara wins May edition

George Patrick Sisira Kumara completed a pillar to post victory as he returned a 3 under par closing round to hold on to the lead, by 2 strokes from Amarapadma who finished strongly with the joint best card in the final round at 4 under par. Sachin De Silva too shared the best card score of 67 and finished strongly to secure 4th place. J M D Indika who shot a 7 under par second round closed the May Edition of the UTE Engineering PFGP with a 3 under par 68 to take 3rd place.
Sisira Kumara’s 4 consistent rounds under par gave him a grand total of 12 under par to register an important victory and more so, secure his top rank at #1 of the Pin Fernando Grand Prix rankings for 2018. A significant statistic from the UTE Engineering PFGP May Edition result is that the top 5 players were under par aggregate of 4 rounds with 7th placed Vinod Weerasinghe completing the 4 rounds at even par. The high standard of Golf returning good scores in tough, windy and weather conditions augurs well for Sri Lanka golf, as the Asian Games 2018 gets closer and team selection becomes more competitive.
