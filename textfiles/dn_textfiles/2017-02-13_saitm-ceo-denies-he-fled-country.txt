SAITM CEO denies he fled the country

 
South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) CEO Dr. Dr. Sameera Senaratne has denied he left the country without notifying the Police.
‘The OIC of the Mulleriyawa Police was duly informed…I was escorted to the airport by assigned police personnel for reasons of security’, Dr. Senaratne said in a statement released to the media today.
The full text of the statement is reproduced below:
‘I note there is much undue speculation, disinformation and untruths currently being circulated in the mainstream and social media pertaining to the circumstances of my leaving the country.
May I take this opportunity to state that I am currently away in Russia as part of an official SAITM delegation on invitation by the Nizhny Novogorod State Medical Academy, which had been planned many weeks before.
The SAITM delegation also includes its Registrar and two of its MBBS graduates. The OIC Mulleriyawa Police had been duly informed of my current visit to Russia and I was subsequently escorted to the airport by the assigned police personnel for reasons of security.
I wish to convey my thanks to the Mulleriyawa Police OIC and the team. As the investigations into the shooting are still on going, I would urge all interested parties to be patient.
The SAITM delegation will return to Sri Lanka on the 21st of February, after following the completion of its tour,’ the SAITM CEO said.
