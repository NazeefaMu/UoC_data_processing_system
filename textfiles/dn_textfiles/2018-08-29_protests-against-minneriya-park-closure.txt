Protests against Minneriya Park closure

Safari jeep drivers protested the temporary closure of the Minneriya National Park, while blocking the Polonnaruwa – Colombo main road near its entrance, yesterday.
However, authorities took steps to open the park for the public, yesterday afternoon.
The park was temporarily closed following a clash between a group of people and forest rangers last Sunday, over the arrest of a fisherman engaged in illegal fishing.
Police said forest rangers had apprehended the fisherman near the Minneriya tank in Ambagaswewa.
A group of villagers had later attacked forest rangers and freed the suspect. Six forest rangers were injured in the incident, police said.
