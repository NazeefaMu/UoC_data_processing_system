eLocal Government Solution launched

The Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA) of Sri Lanka together with Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry ceremoniously unveiled the eLocal Government Solution (eLG) on January 29.
The system is expected to get onboard 30 local authorities at the time of unveiling and will progress towards including all 341 local authorities in the future.
Heralded as a progressive move towards the promotion of digital nativity in the government through the facilitation of digital access to public services, the solution aims to assist the public in setting their assessment taxes, obtaining certificates (business and trade related) and permits (construction and other) as a first step. The highly scalable solution is further expected to introduce other avenues of public service access to citizens introducing unmatched convenience and efficiency to the largely archaic present mechanisms.
The launch of the eLocal Government Solution was held at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) with the participation of Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faizer Mustapha, Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando and ICTA Chairperson Chithranganie Mubarak and other officials representing those institutions.
“We have always shown great interest in the development of this solution to establish an environment that is more citizen-friendly, hassle-free and transparent for citizens when dealing with Pradeshiya Sabhas, Urban and Municipal Councils. Naturally, these benefits must be achieved by enhancing the processes in place and introducing aspects such as cashless transactions.
The eLG solution and the intervention of ICTA and the Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Ministry are both timely and opportune in this regard,” stated Minister Faizer Mustapha.
“The Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Ministry takes it upon itself to be vigilant with regards to opportunities that present itself for the creation of a fully-fledged digital economy in line with the government’s initiative in this direction. The partnership with the Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry is a prime example of this digital readiness of our Ministry.
We are optimistic regarding the ability of this project and other similar projects to overcome technological barriers and transform the citizen experience for all Sri Lankans,” said Minister Harin Fernando.
Similar deployment of digital platforms is common in the commercial landscape of the modern world and as of recent years has been ubiquitous in the region and in Sri Lanka with many industries yielding to the enhanced user convenience and experience of digitization.
Governments of the developed world too have long since recognized the importance of leveraging digital technologies to ease the experience of their citizens.
It is in this context that ICTA and the local authorities are pursuing solutions such as the eLG solution to keep pace with the global progression towards a digitized reality dubbed the “new normal.”
“The initiative is a timely one at a time when the country’s digital adoption is growing rapidly.
Our responsibility as the premier institution for Information and Communication Technology in the country has been to ensure that access to digital services and infrastructure is made available to the masses and not restricted to the urban areas and demographics.
We remain committed to our vision of bringing solutions like this to the grassroots levels of society and the local governments is the best place to start in our view.
We are confident the new solution will not only enhance the user experience but also spearhead the digital revolution taking place in Sri Lanka currently,” said ICTA Chairperson Chithranganie Mubarak.
ICTA is the apex ICT institution of the government and has been mandated to take all necessary measures to implement the government's policy and action plan in relation to ICT by the Information and Communication Technology Act No.27 of 2003. The ICTA is a wholly owned institution by the government overseen by the Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Ministry.
