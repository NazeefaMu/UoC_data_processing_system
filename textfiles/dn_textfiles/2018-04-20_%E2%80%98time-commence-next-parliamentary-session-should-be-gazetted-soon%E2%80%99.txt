‘Time to commence next parliamentary session should be gazetted soon’

The time to commence the sittings of the second session of the eighth Parliament has to be gazetted soon, Deputy Secretary General of the Parliament Neil Iddawela yesterday said.
He told Daily News that the gazette stating the time Parliament would convene on May 8 would be gazetted this week or the next.
Although the special gazette notification issued by President Maithripala Sirisena on April 12 prorogued the first session of the 8th Parliament, the gazette had not mentioned the time the second session would begin.
“Necessarily, the time to commence the sittings has to be gazetted,” Neil Iddawela said. He hoped that it would be done soon to give them time to prepare for the next parliamentary sitting.
The President by virtue of the powers vested in him by Article 70 of the Constitution prorogued Parliament with effect from the midnight of April 12 and fixed May 8 as the date to commence the next session of Parliament. The first session of the eighth Parliament commenced on September 2, 2015.
