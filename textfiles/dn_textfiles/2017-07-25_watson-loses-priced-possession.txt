Watson loses priced possession

Emma Watson has lost something very close to her heart, and now she is asking her fans for help. The 27-year-old star took to Facebook to share a lengthy post explaining how she lost three of her rings after she forgot them in a spa.
People.com reports that the reason why the rings are so special to her is revealed in the post that she shared online along with the photos of the jewellery.
“Were these just any rings I could accept this, but one of them was a gift from my Mum. She bought it the day after I was born and wore it for 18 years, never taking it off, and then gave it to me for my 18th birthday. I wear this ring every day, it is my most meaningful and special possession,” read a part of the post.
She also declared that anyone with information regarding the silver rings would be rewarded.
