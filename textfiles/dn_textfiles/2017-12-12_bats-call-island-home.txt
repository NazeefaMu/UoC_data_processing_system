Bats that call the Island home

The island-wide conversation surrounding dengue fever, which plagued over 173,000 Sri Lankans so far this year, often transforms into a lamentation over mosquitoes—of their presence in the country, the stillwater that allows them to breed, the preventative measures that should have been taken but weren’t. Usually missing from the conversation, however, is an appreciation for the things—or, rather, creatures—that likely kept the epidemic from getting even worse: bats.
When people think of bats, scientifically classified as Chiropterans, images of pesky, spooky harbingers of bad luck usually come to mind. But these stereotypes are damaging, not just because they are untrue but because they prevent people from appreciating the many ways bats contribute to society and benefit the human species. One such way? Insect control. And there are many more.

However, without an understanding of the uniquely important ways in which humans depend upon and rely on bats, there lacks incentive to ensure the species’ conservation and survival. This is one of the forces which drove Professor Wipula Bandara Yapa, a leading Chiropterologist and head of the Zoology department at the University of Colombo, to write “A Field Guide to the Bats of Sri Lanka”. Published by Dilmah Conservation and released last week, the book catalogues all thirty species of bats known to inhabit the Sri Lankan landscape and explains in depth the reasons why people should care about the future survival of bats.
The most interesting mammals in the world?
Bats are mammalian creatures which, like humans, give birth to live young, nurse them with milk, and often bring them along in search of food. After rodents, they are the most diverse group of mammals. But even more singularly, they are the only mammals ever to have evolved true and sustained powered flight.
“Their forelimbs are modified to form a wing, which is so different from that of birds. The bat wing is a membrane which covers the hand and also sides of the body,” Professor Yapa writes in his book.
As well, bats have effective orientation systems, using sound signals to perceive their environment, called echo-location. According to Yapa, evolution of flight and echolocation are the main parameters in the diversification of feeding and roosting habits, reproductive strategies, and social behaviours of bats. He explains that these specializations have allowed bats to exploit many ecological niches inaccessible to other mammalian groups, contributing to their diversity and success.
“So far, over 1,200 species of bats have been recorded, amounting to roughly one fourth of the total number of mammals recorded at present... They have successfully colonised almost every continental region on earth (except Antarctica), as well as many oceanic islands and archipelagos,” Yapa writes.
30 Species, each unique
Since Sri Lanka has the greatest biodiversity per unit of any country in Asia, it’s understandable that at least thirty bat species call this island home. Bats, generally, are divided into varying suborders and groups depending on an array of factors including their body, nose, and ear-type, the presence or lack thereof a tail, wingspan, diet, their roosting and dwelling locations, and more.
There are fruit bats, scientifically known as Pteropodidae, of which there are four species found in Sri Lanka. Unsurprisingly, their name is derived from their diet; fruit bats feed on the seeds, pulp, juice, and nectar of a wide variety of fruits, flowers, and leaves. The fruit bat family contains the largest bat type in Sri Lanka—called the common flying fox, or pteropus giganteus—with an average wingspan of about 120 cm.
Then there are insectivorous bats, which also get their name from their feed of choice: insects, including beetles, termites, grasshoppers, mosquitoes, and others. In Sri Lanka, insectivorous bats are represented by a few main species groups, each containing specific species under them: horseshoe bats, leaf-nosed bats, evening bats (the largest bat family in Sri Lanka), sheath-tailed bats, and free-tailed bats.
Finally, there are carnivorous bats, represented in Sri Lanka by false-vampire bats, of which there are two species in Sri Lanka. Vampire bats feed on smaller vertebrates such as frogs, birds, mice, and even smaller bats. They are called false-vampire bats because throughout history, until scientists proved otherwise, the bats were believed to feed on blood.
It should go without saying that this is just a brief overview of bat life in Sri Lanka; those looking for more details should read for themselves “A Field Guide to the Bats of Sri Lanka”.
The importance of Bats in Sri Lanka
Professor Wipula Yapa at the launch of his new book, A Field Guide to the Bats of Sri Lanka.
At last week’s launch event for “A Field Guide to the Bats of Sri Lanka”, held at the home of Dilmah in Peliyagoda, Yapa said aloud the question he knew was on many minds.
“Why bats?,” he asked. “I know they’re not the most charismatic creatures.”
He answered by insisting how underappreciated bats are, especially when the benefits they provide to society are taken into consideration. According to Yapa, bats are vital to the restoration and enrichment of ecosystems, including rainforests and other key ecological habitats.
Yapa also outlined three main essential eco-services bats perform in contribution to human health and well-being, which he elaborates upon in his book: pollination, seed dispersal, and finally insect control. The first two services are performed by fruit bats, the third by insectivorous bats.
“A wealth of food and drink, as well as medicines, comes to us by way of the efforts of numerous bat species,” Yapa writes of fruit bats.
“Many of the world’s most valuable crop plants such as avocado, breadfruit, cashew, clove, date, fig, mango, and peach rely on bats for pollination. It is estimated that over 450 economically significant plant species—100 of which are edible—are known to depend on bats.”
As well, he writes, “Bats pollinate and disperse the seeds of more than 100 plant species used to produce food and drinks. Bats also play a crucial role in tropical reforestation. Some studies have shown that, in certain ecosystems, the seeds dispersed by bats account for up to almost 95% of forest re-growth in cleared land.”
Then there are insectivorous bats, which Yapa states are the main consumers of nocturnal flying insects, unmatched by any other predator in hunting and thereby controlling nocturnal insects. Other animals which prey on insects are handicapped at night due to hampered vision. But bats are capable of detecting and entrapping flying insects due to their unique, sensory echolocation.
“They also have a very high metabolic rate which requires them to consume a large quantity of insects. Generally, a bat would consume at least a third of its body weight in a single night,” Yapa writes.
“Thus, large colonies of insectivorous bats may result in the large-scale depletion of pest insects in surrounding habitats. Since biological pest control involves the use of natural enemies to suppress pest population densities to levels lower than they would otherwise be, insectivorous bats can potentially act as biological pest control agents.”
A specific bat deserving of appreciation, especially given the spate of dengue outbreaks in the region in recent years, is also the insectivore most commonly found in Sri Lanka: Schneider’s Leaf-Nosed Bat. According to Yapa, recent studies in Sri Lanka have shown that this species is a major natural predator of mosquitoes, which comprises 15 percent of the species’ diet. As well, 47 percent of Schneider’s Leaf-Nosed Bats’ foraging time occurs during twilight, when mosquitoes are active.
Under Threat
Among experts in the field, there is a consensus that bats in some ecosystems fit the definition of a “Keystone Species,” defined by Yapa as a species on which the survival of the entire ecosystem depends. Yet, acknowledgment of the outsized role bats play has not prevented them from coming under attack. Recent investigations have revealed that up to 60 percent of bats do not survive past infancy. Today, they are considered to be one of the most threatened groups of mammals, with several species already extinct and nearly seven species in Sri Lanka listed as nationally threatened.
The threats facing bats are many. First, there is destruction and deterioration of bats’ habitats due to deforestation.
“These activities have resulted in the loss of roosting sites such as cavities, tree holes, and foliage roosts as well as loss of foraging habitats,” Yapa writes.
“Bats have highly specific roosting and feeding requirements and any changes in such habitats could result in a decline of bats in large numbers.”
Second, the shift in agricultural practices from traditional methods to more harmful ones, such as the excessive use of pesticides, presents a major threat to insectivorous bats. Finally, blame must be placed with humans, which Yapa calls the biggest threat to bats. Humans are not only responsible for deforestation and the use of pesticides but also often harm bats, according to Yapa, “out of ignorance or without realising how important bats are for our well-being.”
How People Can Help with Conservation Efforts
Fortunately, not all hope is lost. In his book, Yapa provides a few ways for us to help with rather than hurt bat conservation efforts.
He explains that since one of the main threats facing bats is rapid deforestation and destruction of their habitats, humans can try and ameliorate the situation by creating and providing artificial roosting sites for the animals. He details how to create these roosting sites, from bricks and tiles or even wooden bat boxes, in his book,
Mainly, though, he emphasizes that the key way to help bats is just to learn more about them and thereby gain an appreciation for them.
“The best we can do to protect bats is to make the public aware. They will rarely harm a bat if they understand that bats are not harmful, and know of the services provided by bats and how valuable bats are for our well-being.”
“A Field Guide to the Bats of Sri Lanka” is the 13th addition to Dilmah Conservation’s Field Guide series and the sole guide to all the 30 species of bats known to inhabit the Sri Lankan landscape. The book represents three decades of field research and study by the author. Priced at LKR 350, it is available at the Dilmah t-Lounges on Chatham St. and Independence Arcade, and at the Dilmah Tea Boutique at Crescat.
