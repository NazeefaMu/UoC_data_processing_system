New insurance scheme for fisherfolk

State Fisheries Minister Dilip Wedaarachchi, addressing the gathering of Tangalle fisherfolk who received new insurance policies recently , said that the fisherfolk now live with the dignity of fishing as a profession, due to the facilities provided to them by the yahapalana regime.
He said he is quite aware of the difficulties faced by fisherfolk.
The state minster said that a government servant retires at a certain age, but a fisherman engages in the occupation of fishing well into old age. He said that the multiday boats have been insured and the necessity has arisen to insure ordinary fishing craft.
Describing the privileges of the new insurance scheme for fisherfolk, the state minister said that a fisherman has to pay only Rs. 995 per year for compensation of Rs.12 lakhs for an accident, while Rs. 2.5 lakhs will be paid as compensation in case of death, along with hospital fees and facilities for the education of children.
The state minister said that a fear psychosis reigned during the previous regime and now people live in peace and harmony.
He said that the present regime took over a debt-ridden economy due to the mismanagement of the previous regime.
