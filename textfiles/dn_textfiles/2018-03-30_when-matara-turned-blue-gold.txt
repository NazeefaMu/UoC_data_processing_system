When matara turned  Blue & Gold ....

March 17, 2018 was a ‘Blue and Gold’ day to the beautiful Southern coastal city of Matara as Rahula College pledged its pride and solidarity decorating ground, sky and waters in their school colours with thousands of Rahulites, young and old re-united at the ‘Walk for Rahula’ Blue and Gold Parade.
The Rahula OBA organized the event with the blessings of Rahula College Principal Francis Welege, staff, students, old boys and well wishers. Present and old Rahulites walked with grace as a gesture of gratitude towards their alma mater while showcasing the strength of brotherhood. The project is a fund raiser to make the ‘2020 Vision Rahula’ a reality.
