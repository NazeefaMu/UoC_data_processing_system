Because pregnancy is a shared responsibility

Hemas Hospital in Wattala hosted a celebration on November 11 to commemorate 10,000 successful baby deliveries at the hospital chain, coupled with a promotion of their special ‘Maathru’ package of perks for new mothers.
Maathru is a very impressive financial leg-up for women with newborns. It includes the entire baby- delivery process at a fixed price (at rates between Rs. 40,000 and Rs. 85,000), including the labor room, medicines, doctor’s fee and use of the pharmacy, laboratories, ICU and other hospital units.
It also includes a savings account partnered with HNB with a Rs. 1500 opening balance, gift packs of diapers, baby toiletries, infant clothes and bottles from Baby Cheramy, Farlin and other brands, a 10% discount worth over Rs. 10,000 for essential vaccinations for the baby up to 10 years of age, 10% off Farlin flagship stores, 10% off for online purchases from Happiness.lk and free antenatal classes at the hospital.
The benefits provided are clearly manifold and seem an attempt by the institution to make the patient’s daunting transition into caretaker a smooth one.
Speaking on the occasion at Hemas Hospital, Director of the Private Health Sector Regulatory Council, Dr Kanthi Ariyaratne, stated that a pregnancy is not one person’s responsibility, but in fact “a shared responsibility,” between family members, and between the hospital staff and the family.
She went on to say that knowledge and the right attitude were integral to how well patients were treated at Hemas, and that more valuable than the commendable high-tech facilities they have, is “the human touch - the relationship between two humans” - that truly defines the experience that a patient has at a hospital.
Countless new mothers and infants filled the lobby of Hemas Hospital at the event, ushering in a new era of their lives, and grateful for the support that Maathru gives them at the beginning of it. The hospital’s move to celebrate the mothers and their children, even years after birth, marks its endeavor to form lasting bonds with its patients.
Hemas Hospital prides itself on being accredited by the Australian Council of Healthcare Standards, and reaches to do more than just treat patients as patients, but as life-time customers. “The Maathru package just enhances the parent’s experience and is our way of thanking them for choosing to have their babies at our hospitals,” stated Dr Peiris of Hemas staff.
