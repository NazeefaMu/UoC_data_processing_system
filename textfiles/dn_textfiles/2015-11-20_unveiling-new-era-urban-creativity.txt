Red Rave Art Walk
Unveiling a New Era of Urban Creativity

As Cinnamon Red’s first anniversary approached on the 1st of September, an art and design competition titled ‘Red Rave’ was launched on August 3 via the hotel’s Facebook page, encouraging more artists to submit proposals and sketches for potential work to be added to the currently colourful car park featuring eight pieces from last year’s competition.
From a staggering 61 entries 10 artist’s creations (initially they decided only choosing 5) were finally chosen by the selection committee (John Keells Holdings Deputy Chairman Ajit Gunawardena, Cinnamon Hotels & Resorts Sector Head City Hotels Rohan Karr, Cinnamon Red General Manager Terrence Fernando and Cinnamon Hotels & Resorts Head of Marketing Communications - City Hotels Tharika Goonathilake.
These 10 talented artistes won a cash prize each, art supplies and a full board stay at the hotel.
“Cinnamon Red has brought a new dimension to the tourism industry in Sri Lanka and we hope that our trendsetting approach to cater to the new-aged traveller will also be reflected in the way we create and craft new experiences through the form of art; and not just through innovative design, products and services. We place high importance in bringing local talent to the spotlight and help upcoming artists continue their journey to rise in prominence. By providing these artists Red’s vibrant spaces to develop their creative expressions, we hope we have done just that”, Terrence Fernando commented.
This year’s winners include three artist collectives including Doodle Dumps, The Hermits and P413, the latter being featured the previous year with two pieces as well. Individual artists include Yogya Thalagala, Kavindu Abeysundera, Supun ‘Zetter’ Ravisanka, Lishni Tilakaratne, Stefan Pakinathan, Udani Samaraweera and Samithira Sriranganathan Sami all the way from Jaffna. Their respective pieces will add to the current collection of work at the Cinnamon Red car park turning the space into a must-see art walk when in Colombo. Together, the pieces tell the story of the country’s emerging creativity and alternate urban expression. The artists selected are at the very top of their game; one of the artists from last year, Ruwangi Amarasinghe has since gone on to exhibit in London and create a piece in Berlin earlier this year as well.
Yogya Thalagala, whose piece will begin the narrative journey of art is a school teacher by day and encourages young minds to keep expressing themselves creatively. “My piece depict giant, open hands with a 3D feel, using red, black and white to bring out Cinnamon Red’s vibrant brand identity.
While I have created many pieces on canvas and cloth before, this will be my first major piece of work – something I am very excited to be creating for the hotel”, she tells us. Yogya and the other nine winners are the newest hallmarks of Cinnamon Red’s continuing trend to engage with cutting edge urban creativity that makes their car park as exciting a space as anywhere else of the vibrant hotel.
