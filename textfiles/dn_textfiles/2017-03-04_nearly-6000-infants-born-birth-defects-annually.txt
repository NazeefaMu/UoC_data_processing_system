Nearly 6,000 infants born with birth defects annually

Annually, around 6,000 infants are born with birth defects and it is the second leading cause for infant deaths (20 percent) in Sri Lanka. Around 2,000 infants are born in Sri Lanka annually with congenital heart diseases, Acting Director General of Health Services Dr. J.M.W. Jayasundara Bandara said.
He said so while addressing a press conference held at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo yesterday. He said that some of the infants suffer from birth defects such as congenital heart diseases which could be cured through surgery, while President Maithripala Sirisena stated recently that he would provide the required funds for such surgeries.
The `Little Hearts’ projects which is now going on would be able to collect a part of the funds required for such surgeries.
According to Dr. Bandara, the human being is a complete and perfect creation of mother nature and if there is any type of defect in him, it is caused by nature due to the conflict between nature and human beings. As long as human beings live according to the system created by nature, he or she would not be affected by various diseases and health issues.
Meanwhile Consultant Community Physician Dr. Kapila Jayaratne ( MBBS, MSc, MD (Com.Med) said that only 5.6 percent of infants / children bellow the age of five die in Sri Lanka annually and only eight children out of every 1,000 die before celebrating their first birth day. Statistics are very satisfactory when compared with developed countries such as UK, where four children below the age of five die out of 1,000 every day.
