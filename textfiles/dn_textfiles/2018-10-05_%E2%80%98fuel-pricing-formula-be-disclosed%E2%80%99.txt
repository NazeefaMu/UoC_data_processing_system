‘Fuel pricing  formula to be  disclosed’

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said that the government would disclose the fuel pricing formula to the media, yesterday. Oil prices would be reduced by December, he added.
Oil price hikes were not an issue only in Sri Lanka, and domestic fuel prices depended on
international fuel prices, the minister said.
