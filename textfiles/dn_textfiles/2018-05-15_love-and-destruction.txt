Of love and destruction

From the battles between the gods of old and their struggle for power and to modern day problems that might lead to our extinction, Constellation is a band that addresses issues concerning love and destruction. Melodies speaks to Eshantha Perera of Constellation about this passion of theirs.
Gallows of the Mind was well received by a lot of people. It was a big breakthrough for Constellation. Here partly the inspiration was Egyptian Mythology – the Children of Ra the sun God. Like the old Greek and Roman Gods and others deities worshipped through the world, even the Egyptian Gods also fought amongst themselves. Some of these myths have been brought to life in literature like the Percy Jackson stories.
“There we talked about the Egyptian God Set, who is the brother of Osiris. He killed the God Osiris by chopping him into many pieces. We are big fans of Egyptian Mythology. What we tried to do is put Set in a hypothetical situation where in the present day you have a massive following of Set - People who believe that Set is the rightful God to rule the earth which is like a cult. They have come together to bring Set back and put him on the throne and wage a war of righteousness. If there was a universal theme to our music I guess that would be the condition of human nature. It is what we think god wants us to do. And I think there may be a cult out there for real – People worshipping Set. I mean we do have Satanism in this world.
When I speak of Satanism I am not talking about those psychos who go out there and kill in the name of Satan. There is legitimate Satanism where they do not see Satan as the Devil. They have a proper bible and they are pretty decent people,” ” explained Eshantha Perera.
Gallows of the Mind which was released very recently is one of their most prominent releases. That addresses how humans are destroying the environment.
“It was in line with our newest theme in music. We had a stage of evolution from back then to now. One of the two songs that we composed for TNL onstage – was the Blight on Gaia. Gaia is essentially nature. So we speak of how people are ruining nature – we are destroying forests and polluting the world and that was one message we wanted to give out. So the two singles were pretty good compositions for us,” said Perera. Perera also emphasized on his worry that technology may be our undoing one day.
“Currently we are working on an album which is supposed to come out somewhere in August. One of the initial themes we have for the album is a new world order. Currently when you look at the situation in the world technology is starting to become the new world order. There is an issue as to how technology is ruling us and technology is where our information comes from. We talk about technology and politics as well. Political policies in the world are not always positive. But you get some pretty decent and honest politicians out there. There is a lot of war and cyber terrorism. ‘Devouring the Sun’ spoke of a new world order where humans were evolving to a point where with technology we are becoming slaves. We will become our own extinction,” stated Perera.
Perera and his band members are in no ways anti-religious. They simply make an effort to highlight what is happening in the world right now in connection with religion.
“We do not call ourselves anti- religious. I am a catholic and there are a few Buddhists in my band. There is even one atheist. But we collectively believe that organized religion in its own way can be an issue. ‘Children of God’ was released back then and something which will be improved and re-released again with the album in August. Here we were being very sarcastic concerning its main theme which was War. A lot of people even kill in the name of God. And I mean religion should be of love. God never wants us to kill someone else. There again we were being sarcastic because we were saying how hypocritical people are killing in the name of a god of love. You kill in the name of God and then go to places of worship and talk about love. It is hypocrisy,” challenges Perera.
Perera points to the imperfection of human understanding and its limits and the inability of some people to empathize and understand the pain others feel. “Who I call God is who a Muslim would call Allah. It is the same person. But we as human beings. Religion is a man -made word. It is not a word that God gave us. Every single religion says ‘do the right thing’. Be nice to other people. This is very universal. God may be called by other people as Gaia, Mother Nature or the cosmic energy, it is still the same thing. We as a band feel that these are walls that have been built around each other. These are walls that we have built. That is another topic we touch on and also we touch on things that degrade humanity. But if you take religious personalities take Pope Francis. He is a wonderful person. An amazing individual who is honorable and decent.
He has said that if a man says he loves another man, or a woman says she loves another woman, who am I to judge? I am not god. You can’t get more down to earth than that. Because love is love. We have no right to question someone else as long as it does not harm. Some of our stuff may not be easy to decipher. It is not very direct with metaphors,” explained Perera.
Constellation have always wanted to play progressive metal. Technical stuff.
“Honestly I do not know from where the word ‘Constellation’ came from. I know that there was some theory why we chose that name. But now when we all think about it we do not know why we chose that name for the love of god! So Constellation June/July 2014, was when Constellation came together. What happened was that one of the founders invited me to join the band that was being put together for TNL onstage asked me whether I am in. I said I am in.
I liked what I heard and we got together. In the beginning I was not meant to be the drummer. I was just supposed to be the vocalist. So we kept practicing and the night before the preliminaries we had small incident and we were left with no drummer. So I ended up drumming and singing at thew same time,” said Perera.
Constellation went onto win TNL onstage 2014 and was coached by Andrew Obeyesekere of Stigmata for the finals.
“We played two originals and we won. We were the only band in onstage history to have a drummer vocalist and we pretty much got all the awards that year. It was a very special day for us. And right after that in December we had our first gig called ‘The Dying Winter Sleeps’ alongside Stigmata and a few other bands as well. We were honored to immediately do this after singing onstage, and do it with a great band like Stigmata. We have a lot of respect for them. It meant a lot for us.
We have a lot of talent in our band. I mean we have the brains here. There are a few dead metal elements here and there but not too much. Our music is very melodic and ambient. Our music on average is nine to ten minutes long,” summed up Perera.
