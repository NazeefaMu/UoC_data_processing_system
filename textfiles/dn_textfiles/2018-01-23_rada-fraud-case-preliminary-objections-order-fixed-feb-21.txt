RADA fraud case: preliminary objections order fixed for Feb. 21

The Colombo High Court yesterday fixed for February 21, the delivering of its order regarding the preliminary objections raised by former MP Tiran Alles in connection with a Rs. 200 million fraud that had allegedly taken place at the RADA in 2006.
President’s Counsel Romesh de Silva, with Nalin Ladduwahetty PC, appearing for Tiran Alles, alleged that prosecutors have failed to follow the provisions of the Evidence Ordinance when dealing with computer evidence. However, Additional Solicitor Yasantha Kodagoda PC, appearing for the Attorney General (AG), raised a primary counter-objection, citing its premature to raise this objection since the prosecution has not taken a decision to call computerized evidence at this juncture. At a previous occasion, the High Court had allowed the AG to proceed the controversial RADA case in absentia of former North and Eastern Provinces LTTE Financial Head Emil Kanthan, an accused in the case. The AG had filed criminal proceedings against four accused; former RADA Chairman Tiran Alles, former North and Eastern Provinces LTTE Financial Head Emil Kanthan, former RADA Chief Operating Officer Saliya Wickramasuriya, and Dr. Jayantha Dias Samarasinghe, in connection with the RADA fraud.
On October 18, 2016, the Supreme Court had pronounced that the Attorney General has no obstacle to file indictments against Tiran Alles in the High Court and observed that the Interim Order issued by Supreme Court did not bar the AG filing indictments against the petitioner, Tiran Alles, based on the findings of the investigation into the incident.
The second accused, Emil Kanthan, is currently evading courts, and the Colombo Special High Court had also issued an open warrant for his arrest, in connection with attempted murder of former Minister Douglas Devananda.
