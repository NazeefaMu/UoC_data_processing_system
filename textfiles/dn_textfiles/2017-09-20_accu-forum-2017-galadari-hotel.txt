ACCU Forum 2017 at Galadari Hotel

SANASA Federation of Sri Lanka (Federation of Thrift and Credit Co-operative Societies Ltd in Sri Lanka), has the honour of hosting ACCU Forum 2017, from September 16-22, at the Galadari Hotel Colombo.
SANSA Federation in Sri Lanka has hosted this forum in 1985, 1995 and 2006, which drew a great reputation to the co-operative sector in Sri Lanka. More than 400 delegates representing 32 countries, such as Australia, Bangladesh, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nepal, Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, United States and Vietnam along with the ACCU management team are in Sri Lanka for the 2017 forum in Colombo.
The theme of this year's forum is 'Building Bridges Together to Create Value for People and Communities' with the reckoning made possible with the structural base from grass root level to the top of the state. Moving to divert poverty alleviation programs for the common man, SANASA Federation and the district bodies were utilized in distribution of funds.
The leadership moved out to explore opportunities in the global cooperative
arena and tied up SANASA Federation with international cooperative alliances. We have been selected by Robo Bank of Netherlands, World Council of credit unions and other world cooperative associates to work out their programs. Hence SANASA was recognized internationally with the global associations SANASA Federation made in the ensuing years from 1978.
SANASA Federation as the apex body of the SANASA movement is the spokesperson, the representative on behalf of the SANASA community countrywide, dealing with the state cooperative authorities and spelling out the cooperative council and other cooperative institutions.
Internationally SANASA Federation is connected with all cooperative federations of the world and as a member of all international and regional cooperative bodies.
