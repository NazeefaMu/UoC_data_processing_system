Son crushes Lin in Japan Open

 Tokyo: World number one Son Wan-Ho overpowered two-time Olympic champion Lin Dan of China in the men's singles at the Japan Badminton Open Friday, while newly crowned women's world champion Nozomi Okuhara also reached the semi-finals.
South Korea's Son beat the Chinese great with a hard-fought 21-15, 21-15 victory and now faces world champion Viktor Axelsen of Denmark in the semis.
Axelsen, who beat Lin to clinch the world title in Glasgow last month, brushed off a challenge from Indian ace Kidambi Srikanth 21-17, 21-17. Defending champion Lee Chong Wei squeezed past fourth-seeded rising star Chou Tien-chen of Taipei 21-11, 15-21, 21-19. AFP
