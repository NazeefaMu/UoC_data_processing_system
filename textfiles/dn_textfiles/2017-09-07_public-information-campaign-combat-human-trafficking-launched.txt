Public information campaign to combat human trafficking launched

A public information campaign to combat human trafficking was launched yesterday to raise awareness among the general public.
This public information campaign is a part of a project implemented by the Justice Ministry in collaboration with International Organization for Migration, with the financial assistance of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Government of Australia. This campaign aims to raise awareness through TV commercials, district and divisional level public officials, as well as community-based organizations.
Addressing the media after launching the campaign, Justice and Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorala said that the Justice Ministry and National Anti-Human Trafficking Task Force are making every possible efforts to combat this crime. She said that the Government has made significant progress in combating human trafficking and country has been upgraded to 'Tier 2' from 'Tire 2 watch list' by the US Department of State Trafficking in persons report and as a result of that, the country would continue to receive aid, loans and other benefits.
“Human trafficking is an organized crime and it is a punishable offence under the penal code of Sri Lanka. Men, women and children are trafficked for labour or commercial sexual exploitation. The Ministry of Justice implemented a national strategic plan between 2015 and 2019 to prevent and combat trafficking and raising public awareness was a key component of that action plan,” said the minister.
Addressing the occasion, Australian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka and Maldives Bryce Hutchesson said that millions of people worldwide were subjected to human trafficking and more than fifty percent of them are from Asia-Pacific region. “Australia is committed to continuing to work closely with Sri Lanka to combat human trafficking. Not just bilaterally, but we also work regionally and globally as well. Sri Lanka and Australia are working to address the challenges of human trafficking principles' regional mechanism,” said the High Commissioner. Acting Resident Coordinator of United Nations and Chief Mission of International Organization for Migration Sri Lanka Giuseppe Crocetti also addressed the occasion.
