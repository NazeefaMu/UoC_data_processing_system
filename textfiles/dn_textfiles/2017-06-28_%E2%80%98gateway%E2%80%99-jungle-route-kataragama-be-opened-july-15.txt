‘Gateway’ jungle route to Kataragama to be opened on July 15

“Gateway”, the jungle route to Katargama, will be opened on July 15 for the ‘Pada Yathra’ pilgrims attending the Aadivel Festival in Katargama.
The road will be closed on August 2. The foot pilgrims could use the forest route only during the festival, the Additional Government Agent K. Vimalanathan said.
As a large number of pilgrims from various parts of the Island including Jaffna are expected this season, steps are being taken to provide all facilities for them by the coordinating Committee Office headed by Additional Government Agent Vimalanathan.
The office housed at Uhandamalai Temple will start functioning from July 13 and the pilgrims will be provided with water, sanitary facilities, and medical needs. The medical personnel of Ampara, Kalmunai, Thirukovil, and Pottuvil were deployed to oversee the hygiene in surroundings of the Uhanda Kovil.
The Kovil surroundings have been fully cleared by volunteers to maintain the areas dengue free and the Coordinating Committee appealed to the pilgrims to maintain the areas clean and tidy. Drinking water facilities from the Murugan Kovil to the Kumbukan areas would be looked after by the Lahugala Divisional Secretary. Food parcels in polythene, and water in plastic bottles are completely banned in the area. Special transport arrangements are provided by the Sri Lanka Transport Board.
The pilgrims are advised to take all precautionary measures during nights to protect themselves from wild elephants, and leopards.
