Basil’s predictions a farce - SP Chief Minister

If the statistics put forward by former Minister Basil Rajapaksa were true and correct, Mahinda Rajapaksa should have remained President of this country to date. Basil's statistics are not only farcical, but also incorrect, Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijeyalal de Silva said.
The chief minister was addressing an election meeting held at the residence of former urban council member Berty Ranasuriya in support of SLFP candidates contesting the Ambalangoda Urban Council and Pradesheeya Sabha elections recently.
Shan Wijeyalal de Silva said no one contesting an election would concede defeat until the final counting of the votes cast. During the last Presidential election campaign, former minister Basil Rajapaksa claimed that Mahinda Rajapaksa would win all districts except two. He produced statistics too to prove his claim. But what was the final outcome?, de Silva asked.
The common candidate Maithripala Sirisena won the election convincingly as no one expected. Today, Basil Rajapaksa was making predictions about the forthcoming local council elections too. The people would not get misled by them because they knew that his predictions and statistics were a farce.
Although people attend political rallies in large numbers, they vote differently according to their conscience on voting day as proved at the last Presidential election. The outcome at the forthcoming election would also be the same because the UPFA was now way ahead of other parties in comparison to its showing at the start of the campaign.
President Maithripala Sirisena is a pragmatic politician who did not distinguish among people according to their party, community or social status. That was why even the majority of impartial people had joined hands with the SLFP to ensure its victory. The action taken by the President regarding the Bond issue had been acclaimed by the people, the Southern Province CM said.
