Twin sisters give birth to sons on the same day

Identical twin sisters Jalynne April Crawford and Janelle Ann Leopoldo, 30, experienced miscarriages at the same time. Jalynne, from Arizona, has polycystic ovarian syndrome and had an unviable ectopic pregnancy whereby the foetus grew outside of the womb. At the same time her twin, Janelle, from California, had a miscarriage which she experienced again at a later stage.
Jalynne and Janelle then ended up getting pregnant again simultaneously. Now, with some work, they’ve given birth on the same day to two healthy boys.
“We kept telling each other, ‘It’s God’s plan’,” said Janelle. “Maybe this is his way of getting us pregnant together like we’ve always wanted. We’ve got to be patient and accept the journey.”
Following their fertility struggles, the sisters were ecstatic when they discovered they were pregnant, just four days apart.
As their pregnancies progressed, they shared their story with the world, posting a pregnancy photoshoot on Instagram and revealing the painful journey which had got them there.
“I thought it would be helpful if we could reach someone going through this to know not to give up. This happens to a lot of women.” explained Janelle.
Despite their joy at becoming parents again, they worried that they wouldn’t be able to do it together as they resided in different states.
Determined to have the whole family together, Jalynne approached her doctor and asked if it would be possible for them both to deliver on the same day in Arizona.
With their due dates so close, the doctor said it wouldn’t be a problem so they packed up and went to Arizona six weeks before the big day.
In June this year, Jalynne gave birth in the morning and Janelle in the afternoon, with their whole family waiting there to meet the babies. Jalynne, who now has four children, has completed her family, but Janelle, with three, said she is not quite there yet. “I know she and her husband want four kids as well, so they’re not done,” added Janelle.
