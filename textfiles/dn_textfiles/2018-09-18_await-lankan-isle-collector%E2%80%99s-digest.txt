Await Lankan Isle: a collector’s digest

Reaching out to a discerning audience, offering off-the-beaten-track content, Lankan Isle will be launched at the Colombo International Book Fair.
A ‘thinking person’s magazine’, Lankan Isle, lends its voice to all things Sri Lankan. A dynamic publication coming to readers at a time when periodicals have reached saturation point in the local publishing market, Lankan Isle assures a refreshing and a stimulating reading experience.
It's inspired by the island-nation and her people, Lankan Isle’s endeavour is to remind the people and those across the seas, of what makes our island a ‘wonder’. It is also a celebration of the skilled Sri Lankan. True to the spirit of the publication, Lankan Isle will treat its readers to a wide range of subjects including heritage, archaeology, architecture, business, law, diplomacy, cinema, music, literature, sports, wildlife and photography. A quarterly publication, Lankan Isle is essentially a collector’s digest.
It's co-edited by senior journalists – Chandani Kirinde and Randima Attygalle, Lankan Isle invites readers to enrich themselves and acquire new knowledge. The publication is also an inclusive lending voice to often-underscored areas such as disability.
Printed and distributed by Sarasavi Graphics and Sarasavi Bookshop, Lankan Isle is a publication by R & C Associates.
The magazine will be available at the Sarasavi Bookshop stall of the Colombo International Book Fair from September 22 to 30 and thereafter at all Sarasavi outlets island-wide, other leading bookshops and selected retail stores.
