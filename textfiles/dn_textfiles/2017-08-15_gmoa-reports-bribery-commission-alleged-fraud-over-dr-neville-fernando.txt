GMOA reports to Bribery Commission on alleged fraud over Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) will make a complaint today to the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption in connection with the alleged financial fraud and misuse of public property relating to the taking over of the Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing the media at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the GMOA will also make a complaints to the Attorney General’s Department, Auditor General’s Department, the COPE Committee and to the IGP.
“Since the government is spending funds for the hospital, the owner of the hospital is planning to invest the money he saved in politics,” he said. According to Dr. Aluthge, the owner of the hospital is pressurising the Higher Education Ministry Secretary to allow SAITM to take another batch of students in September. The GMOA requests the public not to send children to the illegal and fraudulent institution, he said. The Health Minister did not answer when the media questioned him about the non-existence of the agreement, Aluthge said.
