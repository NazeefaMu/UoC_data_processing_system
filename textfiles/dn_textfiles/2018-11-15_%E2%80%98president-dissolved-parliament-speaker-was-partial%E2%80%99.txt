‘President dissolved Parliament as Speaker was partial’

There are other ways of testing the opinion of the public who have sovereign rights, if one cannot hold an election to do so, Housing and Social Welfare Minister Wimal Weerawansa said, speaking to staff of the Samurdhi Development Department in Sethsiripaya on Tuesday.
The Minister said a cyclone swept across the political field of this country several weeks ago. A new administration headed by Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa was set up replacing the former regime. Subsequently the President appointed a new Cabinet of Ministers and a group of new State and Deputy Ministers.
Since the Speaker shelved his independent stand and became a loyalist of his political party and the foreign embassies during the crisis between the Executive and the Legislature, the President had to dissolve Parliament and enable the people who had the sovereignty to elect a government of their choice to overcome the crisis, Minister Weerawansa said.
Now certain parties had gone to courts challenging the President’s order dissolving Parliament. They expected the Judiciary to issue a fair and reasonable order on the decision taken by the President to dissolve Parliament. The government did not wish to settle this problem in Parliament by bribing members, he said.
No one can oppose the government’s decision to seek public opinion at a general election. The government had never tied to cheat people by seeking a referendum to extend the life of Parliament. There was no better democracy than testing the people’s opinion at a general election, he said.
Minister Weerawansa said he considered the Samurdhi or Divi Neguma movement as an army dedicated to eliminating poverty among people belonging to all communities in towns and villages. This movement had strived to improve the living standards of nearly 1.4 million families living in this country.
The Minister said an army would perform its duties meticulously if it was provided with all necessary facilities. As such, the officers in the Samurdhi movement should be first made to feel contented to be perform an efficient service to the Samurdhi families. Their problems, challenges and difficulties should be looked into if they are to provide efficient service to poverty-stricken families.
The Minister said he did not treat this matter as an insurmountable challenge. An inauspicious time when all services would cease would come during the general election. He hoped to resolve the problems encountered by Samurdhi officials before the advent of that work cessation period, Minister Weerawasna said.
He requested all officials in the Ministry from the Secretary to the lowest officials to extend their unstinted support and cooperation to him to achieve his targets in the Samurdhi movement. He would also request trade unions too to extend their fullest cooperation.
Ministry Secretary Upali Marasinghe, Samurdhi Development Department acting Director General Nimal Kotawalagedera and other officials were also present on the occasion.
