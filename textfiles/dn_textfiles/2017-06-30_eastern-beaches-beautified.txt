Eastern beaches beautified

The Addalaichenai Pradeshiya Sabah made arrangements to beautify the beaches at Addalaichenai, Palamunai and Oluvil to promote them as health resorts and attract local and foreign tourists.
Addalaichenai Pradeshiya Sabha Secretary M. I. M. Fais said tourists are lured to these places due to the cooling breeze and beautiful scenery.
Oluvil beach is thronged by crowds daily to view the lighthouse and the port harbour of Oluvil.
It has been proposed to establish a children’s park, rest cottages, plant trees, provide drinking water facilities and build a hall for public and tourists’ use in the night.
Lighting the areas in the night is another proposal to be implemented soon.
Several cement cabanas and electricity posts were also established.
Gravel roads were completed for the use of vehicles.
