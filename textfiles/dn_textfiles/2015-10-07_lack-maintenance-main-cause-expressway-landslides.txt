Lack of maintenance, main cause for expressway landslides

The Road Development Authority (RDA) is engaged in immediate maintenance work on the drainage system of the Kokmaduwa-Imaduwa of section the Southern Expressway to prevent further landslides.
Two more locations with landslide risks have been identified. Preventive measures are being taken, said RDA Expressway, Operation, Maintenance and Management Division Director S. Opanayake.
The National Building Research Organization (NBRO) on October 1 issued a landslide risk warning for Nalagana Kanda close to the 114 km post of the Southern Expressway between Imaduwa and Kokmaduwa due to adverse weather conditions in the area.
The RDA will open the section for traffic within the next two days.
Negligence in maintenance work in the drainage system when the expressway was constructed has resulted in the current situation, NBRO officials who are investigating the issue said.
The authorities closed the seven kilometre section between Imaduwa and Kokmaduwa for vehicular movement since October 2. They have diverted the traffic through alternative routes which take an extra hour to cover the distance.
"A proper drainage system had been put in place when the expressway was built, but responsible agencies have not carried out maintenance or drainage clearing from the beginning," a source told the Daily News.
There were three streams carrying groundwater down the slope of hill. Many residents depended on natural spring water as Nalagana Kanda was rich with water resources. Unfortunately, these springs disappeared due to the construction of the expressway. We have to face hardships in finding water," a resident, I. Madurawathi said.
"The absence of a proper water management system in the area has caused this disastrous situation. There is a tower on that hill which was recognized as a landslide-prone area. Residents of three houses in high risk area have been advised to be vigilant and to shift to safe locations," H.G.Manoja, another villager said.
Many villagers said that there was no landslide risk in the area before the construction of the expressway.
The NBRO will provide a comprehensive report and recommendations for a permanent solution for the issue in two weeks, RDA Director S. Opanayake said. "We have not provided a permanent solution. But dewatering has been considered as the most cost effective mitigation option. We plan to install horizontal drains to reduce the pore pressure along the slide plane," he said.
Horizontal drains are commonly used in stabilising unsaturated residual soil slopes. This measure will lower groundwater levels and reduce the rate of slide movements.
Measures have been taken by the NBRO and the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) to reduce the landslide risk of the area following the decisions taken at the special meeting held at the Kokmaduwa intersection office on Monday, with the participation of the Heads of relevant government institutions, Opanayake said.
"We earlier predicted the possibility of two landslides in the area. One is active due to adverse weather conditions. However, we have managed to weaken the activation of the other landslide area," he said.

As the first step of the precautionary procedure, the NBRO proposed to establish an early warning system at the site.
The authorities have discussed the situation with the residents of the area.
"We have explained to them that there is no need to panic. The situation is under control," Opanayake said.
The NBRO has also recommended breaking large boulders in the hilly area using chemical explosions to minimise the landslide risk.
The decision to reopen the road for the public will be only after examining the outcome of these measures, Opanayeke said.
He ensured that the contractors of the Southern Expressway followed the instructions of the geotechnical experts seconded from the Moratuwa University.
"They have used soil nailing technique in this project. It is one of the best slope stabilisation measures in the world. The section that was treated with this technique is stable even now. The landslide occurred in the the upper part of the hill," Opanayake said.
Before major mitigation measures are carried out at the site, sub surface water has to be drained out as a temporary measure to slow down the movement of soil, NBRO Landslide Research and Risk Management Division Head R.M.S. Bandara told the Daily News.
"The NBRO has drained out sub surface water and installed an early warning system," he said.
Meanwhile, DMC Deputy Director Pradeep Kodippili said that the Disaster Management Centre has no role to play in the current situation as measures have not been taken to evacuate people.
