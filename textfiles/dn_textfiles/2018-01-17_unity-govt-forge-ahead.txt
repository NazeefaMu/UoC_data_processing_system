Unity Govt. to forge ahead

The two main parties of the Unity Government yesterday agreed to forge ahead as a strong force brushing aside differences if there were any.
President Maithripala Sirisena addressing the Cabinet of Ministers yesterday emphasized the need to work together after he had a lengthy discussion with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The President referring to the Bond Commission report said that it was not released aiming any individual or a group.
He further said that he was not an ungrateful man and outlined his role as the President and said that he did not interfere with any ministry but allowed the government to work independently.
Cabinet sources said that the President delivered at length his political trajectory initially starting from Polonnaruwa.;
The two parties, the UNP and the SLFP agreed to work together despite there had been certain misconceptions in the past, which Cabinet sources described as a common occurrence when two major parties are working together. They also agreed to mange disappointments and disagreements more intelligently so that both parties could endure to implement their programme without any hindrance.
