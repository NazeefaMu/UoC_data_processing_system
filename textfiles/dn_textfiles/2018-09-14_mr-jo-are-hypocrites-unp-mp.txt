MR, JO are hypocrites - UNP MP

Mahinda Rajapaksa and the Joint Opposition (JO) are a group of hypocrites, who speak against India when they visit China and condemn China when they visit India, UNP-MP Harshana Rajakaruna said.
He was addressing a media briefing at the UNP Headquarters Sirikotha yesterday, he said.
When Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Sri Lanka, Wimal Weerawansa called on the whole country to raise black flags.
“Now I challenge him to raise black flags against Mahinda Rajapaksa upon his arrival to the country. When Mahinda is in India along with his son Namal, they are praising India and condemning China. During an interview with the Hindu Newspaper, when he was asked about his views on giving Mattala to India, he skillfully avoided the question and wanted to talk about the President and the government.
If he was straightforward, he should have directly voiced his displeasure over the Mattala Airport deal. But he did not do that as he has always held double standards. This is the type of person that the JO is trying to bring back to lead this country,” Rajakaruna said.
He said the JO is trying to hide their shame for a flopped protest that they brought up this milk packet allegation to hide their shame. He said the UNP has no need to resort to such low actions. He said Basil Rajapaksa was a notable absentee at the protest organised by Namal Rajapaksa.
“I have my suspicion that Basil Rajapaksa could have been behind this milk packet issue to disrupt the protest. The JO boasted that they would not go back without toppling the government and that they would continue the protest and bring the people onto the streets to chase the government and take over power. Their protest was an utter flop and they could not even last until morning, let alone topple the government.”
Rajakaruna said they urge the police to investigate the milk packet allegation and reveal the true culprits. “We suggest that the police look whether Basil has involved in this act.”
Kurunegala District UNP-MP Thushara Indunil said that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has taken his successor Namal Rajapaksa to India to meet Indian PM Narendra Modi to promote his son as a future leader of Sri Lanka. He had told an Indian newspaper that one of his brothers would contest the presidency as his son was still underage. “We would like to know which Rajapaksa brother would contest the Presidential election. If Gotabhaya is chosen, he will join his military junta and ‘Namal baby’ will not stand a chance. If he chooses Basil, it will be even worse, as be will ensure Namal never gets a chance. While some in the JO are canvassing for Chamal Rajapaksa, this will be the end of Namal as he will then ensure Shashendra Rajapaksa takes on after him and not ‘poor Namal baby’. Hence, we ask Mahinda Rajapaksa, which Rajapaksa brother would you promote as the Presidential candidate?”
MP Indunil said Mujibur Rahman and he had toured the streets on the day of the protest just to get a glimpse of the crowds that would attend the protest as boasted by the JO. “We did not distribute milk or pick up empty milk packets. We witnessed only drunk men sprawled on the streets and others consuming alcohol in groups.
This was a pathetic protest and an utter flop. Now they are blaming us about some milk packet issue and trying to hide their shame and failure.” He said that not only Basil Rajapaksa, but even Gotabhaya could have been behind this milk packet issue just to bring Namal to disrepute as he was the one who organised this deflated and pathetic protest.
