UN acknowledges Adivasi’s eco-friendliness – Wanniyela Eththo

The adivasi community has been identified by the United Nations as the only community or group which had led a life which preserved the environment, Dambana Adivasi Community Leader Uruwarige Wanniyela Eththo said.
He said their predecessors had a life intertwined with the environment which was untrammelled and pristine in the past.
The Adivasi leader was speaking as Chief Guest at a World Environment Day ceremony organised by the primary section of Vidyartha College, Kandy recently.
He said colossal damage was caused to the environmental in the world. This is mainly due to commercialism and attendant human competition.
Wanniyela Eththo said people were going after money to achieve development neglecting the environment.
