‘Hot yoga’ guru seeks US bankruptcy

Bikram Choudhury Yoga, the studio that popularised hot yoga, has filed for US Chapter 11 bankruptcy after being dogged by $US16.7 million ($23.4 million) in legal judgements and numerous lawsuits and allegations of sexual misconduct.
Founder Bikram Choudhury, who built a worldwide following with classes of 26 yoga postures in rooms heated to 40.6, has been accused of sexual assault by his yoga practitioners, students, instructors and teacher trainees.
Bikram Yoga has hundreds of studios worldwide and is taught by Bikram-certified teachers.
It is claimed have been developed by Bikram and his guru Bishnu Gosh to improve health benefits.
The Simi Valley, California-based company said in a bankruptcy court filing on Thursday in the Central District of California that its liabilities were worth up to $US50 million.
It listed assets of up to $US1 million, suggesting that its largest creditors - women who are owed money for court judgements awarded against Choudhury - will not be paid in full.
They include Miki Jaffa Bodden, former head of legal and international affairs at Choudhury's yoga school who has an $US8 million claim stemming from a wrongful dismissal case that included sexual harassment claims.
Bodden alleged that Choudhury repeatedly subjected her to vulgar sexual gestures and offensive comments about women and minority groups.
