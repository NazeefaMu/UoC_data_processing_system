Land of singing fish

Juliet Coombe embarks on a series of exciting experiences facilitated by Sunrise by Jetwing where its General Manager Wester Felthman, who is passionate about community tourism and puts Pasikuda on the international travellers map as an all year round place to stay.
Kingsley opened the gate and welcomed us explaining as he offered a cool drink the range of projects they do in Batticaloa with over fifty families working alongside them improving their lifestyles daily. As we walked around the office with vibrant handicrafts for sale in one section and a huge flower banner on the wall with petals opening out showing a variety of exciting cooking and home stay experiences we all decide on doing the full day Let’s Cook and Fish experience. I also fancied the historic Batticaloa tour, which reveals the areas amazing hidden history.
In addition to the experiences they offer a range of services that get you closer to the local textile makers like the Palmyrah weavers and with Sunrise by Jetwing organising the transport to join any one of these exciting full day trips, which are making a huge difference to the area. It makes me and the kids feel that our holiday is making a real difference to an island that has been set back due to civil war, tsunami and a lack of real development in this particular area of the island. Before leaving the office we receive a beautiful hand woven Palmyrah bag of treasures in the form of pre-packed spices including roasted curry powder, seeds, dried curry leaves and a handmade coconut spoon to cook with when we got back home. After looking round the operational area we are taken to the bike shed at the back of the building and are measured up and given a helmet as safety is key to every aspect of their operation.
Then off we head on the bikes along Lake Road, where you will pass historically extraordinary places hit badly by the thirty year civil war and the 2004 tsunami, which has left the ruins of houses decimated by the waves. All that remains in some cases are the water wells as a reminder to all of the devastation that took place across the island. There are several religious buildings that collapsed like the magnificent facade and entrance of Morugan Alayam Tamil Temple and Santa Maria Church on the beach, which the locals have decided to keep as a memorial to the world’s largest ever natural disaster killing a quarter of a million people across the Indian ocean. Our first proper stop is at the Kallady Bridge built by the British in 1924, one of the oldest and longest iron bridges in Sri Lanka, which crosses over the 53-kilometre lagoon, where we learn singing fish can be heard at midnight. Kingsley with a mischievous sparkle in his eyes says some people think it is the song of the mermaids that live in these mythical waters. As we bike along the idyllic stretch of lagoon stopping for a coconut drink to cool off we see where the sea planes land and what remains of the Dutch colonial fort and then head in land to the colourful Batticaloa food market.
In the market we start in the vegetable section and learn how snake gourd is good for combating cholesterol, and discover how buckets full of black cherries currently in season combat diabetes. The boys were amazed by the size of the giant bottle gourds, which are excellent for curing urine infections and the huge variety of herbal leaves for sale by women from the local farms, which are brewed to make all sorts of medieval style healthy medicinal teas. On we bike to Johdy’s cooking class at 10.30am and here in a delightful home stay setting we are taught how to make Tamil style curries and depending on the ability of the group we cook between 8 to 10 curries. The cooking is very different from the Singhalese style and this gourmet hands on experience is lots of fun as we get to cut, learn which spices to use when and mix the ingredients so you can understand the real feel behind the scenes making of these delicious dishes. Johdy is a very patient teacher making us laugh as we all have a go at making their national dishes. My sons favourite bit was pulling the curry leaves off a branch and throwing them into the pumpkin curry as a final flourish at the end and then having a taster of this delicious recipe before sitting down in her garden to enjoy a feast of dishes accompanied by one of four thousand different rice varieties that can be found in Sri Lanka.
After relaxing and meeting Jody’s daughter who is fourteen and already an accomplished henna artist, whose work adorns the walls of the dining room where the cooking class took place. We drink a refreshing lime juice and head out again on our bikes to have a go at one of the islands oldest forms of net fishing. The bike ride reveals village life, even a snake crossing the road if you are lucky and also some of the sadder aspects of consumer rubbish, which really need addressing. Something Sunrise by Jetwing plan to get involved in as clearing up the beaches and other beautiful area riddled with plastic is part of their day to day operational practices. Once on the lagoon we are met by three colourful outrigger fishing boats and after putting on life jackets, we roll up our trousers and wade through the water to each get into one of the pretty canoe like boats, and head out with a net that takes goliath strength to pick up. Even I can't pick it up it is so heavy to carry, let alone throw and watching it unfurl like a giant spiders web is like an epic movie scene it is so spectacular. It is also great fun seeing the ghost like lagoon jelly fish that float by the wooden boats and watch fish jump as the net gets dragged back in, and we all have a go at picking small fish out of its webbing and putting them in a bucket.
After an exciting hour of jelly fish spotting, throwing nets, catching fish and even trying to make our own fishing line for the kids with a string and hook attached to a bottle, we head back to the office. Here we learn about other exciting tours, enjoy a cool drink and have a chance to ask questions about the many other community adventures they organise, which include a plot to plate farming tour and an excellent sailing adventure. All of which one can enjoying by booking a week at Sunrise by Jetwing who are all about being the change we want to see in the world and making a trip to stay in Pasikuda and unforgettable one.
