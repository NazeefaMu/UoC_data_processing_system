Engineering  a future

At the crossroad of Electronic Engineering or Computer Science: Computer Science and Engineering is there for an individual to excel. How to succeed, though, depends on your commitment, interest and, especially, qualities, in-born or otherwise.
Making good use of a Computer Science and Engineering degree needs careful thought. Take a cue from Microsoft Student Ambassador and Software Engineer Keet Milan Sugathadasa.
Winning the Best ICT Student of the Year 2017 is just the icing on the cake for this youth who had represented Sri Lanka in a handful of international competitions.
“I am into product development and innovation is my passion. I decided that computer science is the best route to take if I want to excel in that sector. Technology is changing by the minute. It is a fast paced field. You need to keep track of the field to be update on the subject. That excites me as I am someone who is always on the go,” Keet explained.

He is part of Team Titans, a group of students from the Computer Science and Engineering Department of Moratuwa University, who are sent to represent Sri Lanka at international competitions. Dimuthu Kariyawasam, Buddhi Ayesha, Vindula Jayawardena and Naduni Mendis comprise the rest of the team.
They team took part and reached the world finalist category AirAsia Airvolution 2017 held in Malaysia.
“The event was launched by AirAsia, the Malaysian airlines company, to select products for their company. There were over 300 competitors. We reached the final 20. The Singaporean team was the winners. We had to brainstorm for an idea about a product that will fit their requirements, develop it and market it at the event. We were only given 24 hours to launch our project. We spoke to people, got feedback and developed solutions to combat the issue and finally came up with a product. People get to see the seats that they book when they book online but they do not know what kind of person they are seated next to. Our app allows them to get to know about the personality of the person that they are next to so that they can book a seat next to someone of similar passions and tastes. This way they can interact with them and have engaging conversations with them during the long flights,” he explained adding that this is more like a customized flight seating which allows the flyers to get a better experience on the flight itself. Private and sensitive information like the age of the person will not be revealed through this app.

They also reached the world finalist category at the Imagine Cup 2017 South East Asia Regional Finals held in Philippines and the world finalists category at the Image Cup 2017 World Finals held in the US.
“We presented a product which we developed for asthma patients. It detects their breathing patters via their ears. It is a wearable device which is placed on their ear and it stimulates a mobile game. This is like a treatment for them to breath properly. It was a hit, especially with the kids over there,” he expressed adding that the device was developed with the help of Kalubowila Teaching Hospital and Lady Ridgeway. Hemas Hospitals is currently engaged in helping them in further developing the product.
A born leader Keet has spearheaded many projects at the university. He has organized over 15 major events for the department during his stint. This has gotten him the rare feat of becoming the university’s batch representative for four consecutive years.
“I normally sleep only for about four or five hours a day. This has become a habit because I am consistently engaged in work involving projects or in organizing events. I have put together AGM, batch get togethers, trips, events for other batches and ceremonial events.”
A bundle of talent all rolled into one Keet has excelled academics as well as aesthetics at S. Thomas’ College, Mount Lavinia. He has been named as the best all round student for many years and had been a college prefect, house prefect and secretary of the house. He had held significant positions like being the president, vice president and secretary at many clubs and societies like the Model Rail Road Club, Photographic Club, Social Work and Welfare Society, Classical Music Association, Science Society, Current Affairs Forum, Scrabble Club and Art Club.
Queried about his ability to multi task and pat comes the answer.
“The only thing I did not do is go for tuition classes for my studies. I bought text books and studied by myself. When most of the kids were on the road going from one tuition class to another I used up all my afternoons to take part in extracurricular activities like playing badminton, table tennis, scrabble and rifle shooting. I studied mainly at night. I also engaged in mentoring and public speaking,” he said.
The 24 year old beat more than 400 applicants from the government as well as private sector to clinch the ICT Student of the Year award this year by proving his mettle as a budding young software engineer and an all rounder.
“Lecturers of the Moratuwa University nominated my name. We were shortlisted and after going through our achievements and facing an interview, they finally picked me,” he enthused.

Keet has also won first place in the Inter-University Business Concept Competition – Fiontrai 2016, the Google IO Extended Hackathon held in 2016 and the IESL – YMS Hackathon held in 2015. The events were organized by Moratuwa University. He won the Gold Award at the Emerged Winners at NBQSA 2017 for tertiary technology category at the National Best Quality Software Award 2017.
“I have met some exceptional people during my ventures. They are not public figures but have achieved great heights in their fields. Such people inspire me. Their achievements motivate me to try harder to reach for the stars in my chosen fields,” he mused.
Keet is in his final year at the Moratuwa University. He is also employed as a visiting instructor and grader at the university. His father, Rohitha Sugathadasa, is employed in the banking sector and his mother, Mallika Sugathadasa, is in the medical profession. His brother Leet Milan Sugathadasa is also into banking.
“I got into public speaking when I took part in competitions. The maximum number of audience I have addressed is around 3000. Now I get constant invitations to engage in public speaking,” he added with a smile.
He spends his free time blogging. He reads topics which captures his interests and later shares his thoughts about the subject.
“Excelling in the computer science and engineering field is all about how passionate you are towards the subject. Every field is connected to computer science. You do not have to be an expert to take it on. You will learn something new every day. Never be an expert. Always be a learner,” he advised.
The most difficult part of his profession is the diversity of the people he had to work with.
“Getting diverse people to work together in the same potential is a trial indeed. Everyone needs to be cooperative and collaborative in such a situation. Their levels of understanding and patience is different too.”
His advice to youth is not to be afraid to take risks.
“Take risks and make mistakes. The more you make mistakes, take them as life lessons and learn more. I have faced situations in which I have felt embarrassed in front of many people but I never back down and gave up. Today I am also a professional public speaker,” he said.
