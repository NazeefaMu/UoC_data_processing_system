Vocal Enigma launches website
Seeking to inspire by being inspired

Having being confined to the parameters of social media, Vocal Enigma will now have the capacity to expand their reach with the launch of their website thereby bridging the gap between the group and the target audience.
Vocal Enigma was formed purely out of the want to share the love of music with others. It is the reality of a multifaceted idea that took root in Sri Lankan musician Maneesh Dasanayake. Starting out as a certificate course at St. Joseph’s College of Arts and Science Bangalore India, the choir grew from strength to strength. It was a dream come true when Maneesh, with the support and guidance of then Principal of the College Rev. Fr. (Dr.) Ambrose Pinto, formed Vocal Enigma on November 16, 2010.
Within a short span time, they became Bangalore’s leading choral group by winning the city’s most prestigious choir competition Basel Mission. On completing his degree in India, Maneesh returned to Sri Lanka and brought together friends he had worked with in various choral groups to form Vocal Enigma Sri Lanka. Under his guidance, Vocal Enigma Sri Lanka hosted their first fund raising show ‘From a Distance’ in September 2012 in aid of cancer patients. The Playlist and Kennel Rock in 2013 raised funds for orphans and physically challenged children and AWPA Sri Lanka respectively. Apart from hosting their own shows, the choir has also worked on projects with the likes of Jith Pieris, Roshini Stanley, Sherin Jacob and Bridget Halpe.
Driven with passion brought together in a common love for music, Vocal Enigma is unrestricted with the music they perform. Their performances are inspired from genres of Gospel to contemporary to the 60’s and 70’s and all the way to Broadway. This approach gives the choir a versatile and a choral twist which will cater to the musical taste buds of all generations. As the choir stands as a beacon of how music transcends all barriers for the greater good their goal is to make a difference, even if it means to put a smile on a child’s face.
