Knowledge sharing sessions by Lanka Hospitals

Lanka Hospitals hosted ‘Clinical Sessions 2016,’ a forum created for medical professionals to share and upgrade knowledge, develop a learning culture and maintain continuous education among the medical fraternity in the country.
It was organised to establish quality medical care to local and international patients seeking treatment in Sri Lankan healthcare entities.

The inaugural Lanka Hospitals’ Clinical Sessions comprised well-known consultant doctors and consultant surgeons of all medical specialties, medical officers, nurses and healthcare employees of private and government healthcare entities/hospitals such as Nawaloka hospitals, Asiri Central Hospital, Durdans Hospital, Hemas Hospital (Wattala), Ninewells Hospital, Dr. Nevil Fernando Hospital, Sri Jayawardenpura Hospital, Browns hospital, New Delmon Hospital, Police and Army hospitals and Centre for Diabetes and Endocrynology and Western Infirmary.
“As Sri Lankan medical professionals are living in a globalized world where medical technology is rapidly evolving, we at Lanka Hospitals recognized the timely intervention to bring together the clinical fraternity where knowledge can be exchanged and uplifted for the ultimate benefit of the patients we all serve. Although there are many such activities carried out by the government medical authorities, this is the first time in Sri Lanka that a private healthcare entity stepped in with an effort to elevate service quality and patient care as a public service,” said Director Medical Service, Lanka Hospitals, Dr. Erasha Fernando.
Lanka Hospitals hopes that through initiatives like the clinical sessions, the standard of medical care available across the country will improve considerably and Sri Lanka will be seen as a medical destination of repute internationally as well.
