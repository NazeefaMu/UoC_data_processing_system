What if the world wasn’t as it is?

Scientists and philosophers, also our ancient witch doctors, together with soothsayers have told the world so much about our planet and her celestial neighbours and about their inhabitants. But they have not told us how and why.
But there is someone who can answer all questions. How is it and why? The answer is simple. Why do mortals in times of great anxiety and remorse at moments of great joy and stupendous victories raise their eyes and look up towards Heaven. With tears in their eyes and say Aney Deviyane, Kadawule or Oh God. The same words are said in the tongues spoken in countries around the world. We saw a few most poignant and graphic examples of this at the Rio 2016 Olympics.
Evolution of men ends with the Neanderthal Men. Development of man stops. Then, suddenly the modern, intelligent, handsome modern man. Civilizations began. How? Why?
Man has studied the universe. About the twinkling stars in the universe and the planets that orbit round the sun, while rotating on its own axis? How? Why? Our earth takes twenty four hours for the latter and three hundred and sixty five days round the sun giving us night and day. Also an year respectively. Fascinating! Noble Newton showed us why objects fall on to Mother Earth. But why does everything that goes up come down? A world without gravity. Planets, satellites, meteors, jumbo jets, jumbu fruits flying all over. The sky will be dark with swirling objects. Why gravity? Why an Ozone layer to save living beings from dehydration? Why should there be the space between the earth and the sun comprising of different layers as discovered by man?
Thunder and lightning occur at the same time. The speed of light and the speed of sound travel at different speeds. Why? We see lightning, then can thunder be far behind. Why? Still its fantastic. How is there a 4C layer of water below the mighty masses of snow? Fish and other aquatic life live in it, why? The seasons in temperate regions. Autumn leaves turn colour, begins to tall. Trees go to sleep. Animals go to sleep. Some begin to stock their abodes with food. Winter. Hibernation till spring. Why? How?
What if the rhinoceros, hippopotamus, elephant and the whale were flesh eating? Where would we humans and denizens of the sea and land be? Just think. Whales, shark, sea serpents, jelly fish swimming up stream to keep company with the Geta Kimbula.
Alright man! Have you seen the Hik meeya (white mouse) being pursued by cats. No. The former is slow. Has a bad taste. Always on the ground. It does not become the prey of cats. But not so the roof climbing, swift rattus rattus. A cats delight. Why, had the land lubber being spared? How? The centipede is swift. Could creep into any crevice in a second. Succulent meal for the birds. The millipede – 'hakaralla' is very slow. Curls up when disturbed. Birds and terrestrial cock birds give it a wide birth. It happily roams about. Only humans harm them. Tell me why?
Please tell me as to what the world would be, had the mighty Anaconda and the phython had poison glands in keeping with their size? Or the common garandiya or rat-snake had poison glands Catastrophic.
Human beings, from may be their infant stage to dotage have an affinity to sweet food. Unless of course, the pancreas goes on the war path.
No one likes bitter food. Same with animals and birds. They cannot be even conditioned to lap up bitter food. Why? How?
The hatched fingerlings of the salmon swim down fresh water streams to the sea. They traverse the chilly seas of the North. After around four years, the gravid female returns to the same river or stream that brought them to the ocean as fingerlings. Swim upstream without food. Lay eggs. Return exhausted and undernourished. Never to return to the sea. They become prey to other predators and human salmon hunters. Now, why the same source of fresh water.
Scientists have tagged them. But they have never been able to tell the world why?
Massive earth tremors that brought desolation to millions. The tremors took place in the ocean bed. What if they had taken place on land. Mount Everest, Antarctica, Arizona, Florida. The Siberian wastes or in the inland seas like the Dead sea, Caspian sea, Black sea or in the Sahara. Unthinkable. Our lovely scientists can tell us why. But how and when? That is the question. Yes! We learnt about all this from cradle to grave. Beautiful. With all, these unanswered questions.
I still believe that we, as humans, and all other living creatures and nature can live in harmony and peace on our lovely planet while embracing the words of our celestial teachers in whom we are free to believe in.
