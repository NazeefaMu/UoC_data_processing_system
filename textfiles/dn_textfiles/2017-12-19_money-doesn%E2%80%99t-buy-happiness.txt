Money doesn’t buy happiness

‘All the Money in the World’ is an upcoming historical drama film directed by Ridley Scott and written by David Scarpa, based on John Pearson's 1995 book ‘Painfully Rich: The Outrageous Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Heirs of J. Paul Getty’. It stars Michelle Williams, Christopher Plummer, Mark Wahlberg, Romain Duris, Andrew Buchan, and Timothy Hutton. The film tells the story of J. Paul Getty's refusal to cooperate with the extortion demands of a group of kidnappers, from the organized crime Mafia group 'Ndrangheta, who abducted his grandson John Paul Getty III in the 1970s.
The movie follows the kidnapping of 16-year-old John Paul Getty III (Charlie Plummer) and the desperate attempt by his devoted mother Gail (Michelle Williams) to convince his billionaire grandfather (Christopher Plummer) to pay the ransom. When Getty Sr. refuses, Gail attempts to sway him as her son's captors become increasingly volatile and brutal. With her son's life in the balance, Gail and Getty's advisor (Mark Wahlberg) become unlikely allies in the race against time that ultimately reveals the true and lasting value of love over money. The old adage about money not buying happiness is noble and all, but most of us secretly recognize it would be a relief to have more green; Enough to pay off those bills or save up for the kids’ college or finally go on a real vacation. ‘All the Money in the World’ takes on our perceptions about money and its power in the hands of good and bad alike.
‘All the Money in the World’ screens at Majestic Cineplex at 10.15 am, 1.15 pm, 4.15 pm, 7.15 pm, and Fri/Sat at 10.15 pm. Empire Cineplex at 1.15 pm, 4.15 pm, 7.15 pm and Fri/Sat at 10.15 pm and Sat/Sun at 10.15 am.
