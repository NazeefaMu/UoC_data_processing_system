Fare meters made mandatory for three-wheelers

The government has made it mandatory for three-wheelers to have fare meters with the capability of issuing a printed bill to the passenger once the journey is completed from yesterday.
National Council for Road Safety (NCRF) Chairman Dr Sisira Kodagoda urged the three-wheeler drivers to install a meter which can print a bill at the end of the journey. However, in the meantime, a hand written bill will also be permitted,” he added.
Such meters are already available in the market, but, action will be taken to provide these meters at a concessionary rate on an easy payment scheme.
The main purpose of introducing the new regulations is to prevent irregularities and shortcomings, and to ensure a secure journey for commuters and eventually produce disciplined taxi drivers who would guarantee the safety of both, the commuter and the driver. The government has already given a grace period last year as well as from January 1 to April 1 this year for the installation of fare meters. “After today, the law will be strictly implemented and stern legal action will be taken against passenger transport three-wheelers without fare meters,” Dr. Kodagoda said.
“It is the duty of the driver to issue a receipt for the payment.Such receipt should include the distance travelled, vehicle registration number, amount charged and the date of receipt, he said. Passengers can directly call three-wheeler drivers since the telephone number is printed in the receipt.
There are around 1.2 million three-wheelers in Sri Lanka. Of them around 900,000 run on a daily basis in the Western Province. He said the law was not to exploit three-wheeler drivers but to regulate their service.
However, United National Three Wheeler Drivers and Industry Workers Union President K.D.Alwis said that making a fare meters mandatory is unfair at the moment because the authorities have failed to solve many problems faced by the three-wheeler drivers."
This is an attempt to paving the way for a particular company to begin a business,"he said.
Eventhough the government pledged many promises such as an insurance scheme, a pension scheme and a housing loan scheme for three-wheeler drivers at the previous Presidential election, non of these promises have been fulfilled yet,” he added.
