Heed their call

For the first time in the country's political history the movements, groups and organisations which strove to install a government in power has come out in the open to criticise it for not honouring its election pledges. There have been criticisms leveled from within. There have also been government members who have sat as Independents, over dissent. But never has agitation taken such a form from the outside by groups who lent their shoulder to the wheel to establish a government. Certainly not the Pancha Maha Balavegaya which brought SWRD to power. No segment of the PMB raised their voice against misgovernance or failure to keep to the pledges of the MEP government.
Such a scenario, of course, would have been unthinkable under the Rajapaksa government. Dissent was not encouraged under Rajapaksa, even among Cabinet ministers, in contrast to now under Yahapalanaya. One need not have strained one's imagination to conclude what would have been the fate of the ‘outsiders’ who dared tried to put the regime on the right track.
In that sense, the protest held at the Viharamahadevi Park by the pro-Yahapalanaya civil society organisations, to pressure the government to implement its election pledges, is unique. It is doubly significant, in that, among the protesters were government ministers who were seeing doing a Mea Culpa for the tardiness of the government in bringing to book those involved in mega corruption under the Rajapaksa government- a main pledge under Yahapalanaya.
Speaker after speaker virtually tore into the government for its lackadaisical attitude towards prosecuting the rogues under Rajapaksa. Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne called for trials to be conducted against high ranking officials of the former regime, on a day-to-day basis, before a High Court. He said, the matter had been discussed at the Cabinet and this was likely to be implemented shortly. The minister said, with the new initiative, he hoped all those charged with crime and malpractices will be brought to justice before the next May Day. Other speakers also wanted the investigations expedited.
True, their grievances are justified. Members of these civil society groups, professionals, artistes etc. virtually put their lives on the line in banding themselves together to see the ouster of the Rajapaksas. The Common Candidate, himself, was virtually in hiding on election night and famously said that he would have been six feet underground if the results had gone the other way. There is no knowing what would have become of their fate had the results on January 8 been different.
Besides, individuals of these organisations have being singled out by the JO and Rajapaksa friendly media for special mention, for their crusader role in seeing back of the Rajapaksa regime. Not only them, members of their families too would have felt the full brunt of the retaliation had things gone wrong. Hence their agitation.
Of course, the daring showed by the late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha, under severe odds, to rally these groups and organisations to take the fight to the enemy camp, no doubt, would live in the memory, forever, among those who took up the gauntlet. In that context, the catalytic role of the Ven. Sobitha could be termed as a ground breaking feat in the post independence history of Sri Lanka, which, no doubt, will be appreciated by all those who value freedom and justice. If not for him, there would not have been the same enthusiasm, that the public witnessed, among these organisations to take the fight to the Rajapaksa camp. Hence, it was fitting that the event at the Viharamahadevi Park was dedicated to the Ven. Thera.
But, even the Ven. Maduluwawe, had he been alive, no doubt, would have been a disillusioned and disappointed individual at the way the government had been dilly dallying in bringing the corrupt to book and its other lapses. He would virtually have thrown up his arms in consternation at the manner in which the large scale swindlers of the last government have made bold to point the accusing finger at the functionaries of the Yahapalanaya government, when in fact, the guns should be trained in the opposite direction.
Be that as it may, both, President Sirisena and Premier Wickremesinghe should pay heed to the call of this most vital element of the campaign for good governance and get the machinery in motion to realise the most important pledge of their election campaign. This would not only silence their critics but also expose those now posing as paragons of virtue.
The government should, even at this late stage, take stock of the situation and get cracking, if not for anything else, but to spare these civil society groups and organisations from being pilloried by Opposition politicians for their role in installing the Yahapalanaya government. It is these members who are still holding the fort on behalf of the government, coming over TV talk shows to defend the regime at every turn. They should not be made to feel that they are being taken for granted.
