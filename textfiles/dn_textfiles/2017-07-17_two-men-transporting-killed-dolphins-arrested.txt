Two men transporting killed dolphins arrested

Officers of the Sri Lanka Navy and the Sri Lanka Coast Guard Department on Saturday arrested two persons who were transporting two killed dolphins on a motorcycle at Kudawella. Tangalle.
The dolphins might have been fished in deep seas and brought to the shore in dinky boats. The suspects with dolphins and the motorcycle were handed over to the Wildlife Conservation Department.
