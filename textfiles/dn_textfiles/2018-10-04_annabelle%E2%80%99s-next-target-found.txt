Annabelle’s NEXT TARGET FOUND!

Demon possessed dolls just don’t stay dead like they used to. The ‘Conjuring’ universe is one of the most successful modern film franchises, and it’s not quite done with ‘Annabelle’ just yet.
Audiences learned the origins of the cursed doll in ‘Annabelle: Creation’, but now the doll will once again terrorize some poor family in ‘Annabelle 3’. The horror film as made its first casting announcement and young up and comer McKenna Grace will play one of the leads and the doll’s primary target.
According to Deadline, McKenna Grace has been drafted to star in ‘Annabelle 3’. Grace will star as Judy, the young daughter of the Warrens - the paranormal investigators at the center of the ‘Conjuring’ franchise. Not much is known about the plot at this point, but Judy will become the target of Annabelle, who the Warrens have brought to their artifact room where it can do no harm. But then it does a lot of harm. The film will also follow Judy’s two babysitters, because nothing bad ever happens to babysitters in horror movies.
Despite her young age, McKenna Grace is on a real career renaissance right now. She’s already starred in ‘Gifted’ – the Chris Evans movie, ‘I, Tonya’, ‘The Bad Seed’, and ‘Designated Survivor’. She’s got another horror movie on deck with Netflix’s ‘The Haunting of Hill House’, and soon people will be able to see her in ‘Captain Marvel’ as a young Carol Danvers.
‘Annabelle 3’ is the sequel of ‘Annabelle: Creation’, which itself was a prequel of the first ‘Conjuring’ movie. That makes the period wherein Annabelle takes place a little tricky, but seeing as how the Warrens are already in possession of the doll, it takes place sometime after ‘The Conjuring’ but before ‘The Conjuring 2’. There’s no word if Vera Farmiga or Patrick Wilson will reprise their roles as the Warrens in ‘Annabelle 3’.
‘Annabelle 3’ is currently scheduled to release on July 3, 2019.
