‘Sharp potential in condo investment for Sri Lankan expats’

Sri Lankan expats overseas are eyeing real estate as an investment opportunity, according to real estate sector experts.
This has come to light with the depreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee and many expatriates are looking for apartments that are already built by a reputed company in Sri Lanka, Iconic Developments Pvt Ltd officials said.
A recent report by KPMG said about 18 per cent buying apartments are Sri Lankan expatriates and 4 percent are institutional investors. “This figure has increased substantially with the rupee depreciation,” Rohan Parikh, Managing Director of Iconic Developments Pvt Ltd said.
The average year-on-year depreciation of the rupee from January 1, 2015 to September 21, 2018 was 9.2 percent per year. “This has positioned aspiring expat condo owners in a significantly better position to purchase apartments, Parikh said. In the short span of 14 months since its launch, Iconic galaxy has captured the hearts and minds of investors and residents with more than half of its residences sold. Galaxy builds on Iconic’s success at 110 Parliament Road, with over 172 residences sold in 2 years, on time delivery and double-digit returns. Parikh added that their landmark residences, set in the heart of rapidly growing Rajagiriya, overlooking the Royal Colombo Golf Club, offered a lifestyle and amenities of a caliber never seen before – including an entire 2 floors dedicated to entertainment and fitness, with facilities such as a gymnasium, swimming pool, spa, crèche, sports areas and more. “It’s mostly what those residing abroad have already experienced.” Rohan Parikh said with Iconic Galaxy now poised to become a fitting sequel to the 110 Parliament Road story – one that will set a new standard in Rajagiriya. “It’s now a good time that expat Sri Lankans should ideally purchase apartments in Colombo,” Parikh said. The KPMG report says 61 percent of the buyers of luxury condominiums are local investors, while 17 per cent are local end-users. “During the past few months we noticed there was a major hike in the queries from locals residing abroad,” Rohan Parikh, Managing Director Iconic said.
It also says the moderation in inflation in the first quarter of 2018 and the favorable inflation outlook as well as the continued negative output gap, compelled the Central Bank to end its policy tightening bias and reduce the SLFR by 25 basis points on April 4, 2017.
As witnessed by this report, Sri Lanka’s core economic statistics stand favourable towards aspiring expat apartment buyers. “The GDP has grown marginally in 2017 and is now at Rs. 13.3 trillion while in 2016 it was Rs. 11.9 trillion. The country’s Growth rate is now 4.5 percent,” he said, adding that with this backdrop, the country’s housing requirement is high. “Around 100,000 housing units per year are needed to fill the housing gap,” Parikh revealed, noting that in this light the demand for apartments is increasing.
“There is stable economic growth. GDP per capita in 2017 was US$ 4,065. The government targets a GDP per capita of US$ 5,075 by 2020, propelling the country’s status to an upper middle income economy,” Rohan Parikh said explaining the statistics adding that Colombo Megapolis Development Plan will boost the country’s economy further.
“The Port City will be a game-changer with improvement in internal and external connectivity Sri Lanka’s urbanization growth will amplify from 0.3 per cent to 3-4 percent in the next 15 years, to reach an urbanization rate of 30 per cent by 2030.” Parikh said. He said that Port City Development Project is a key focal point in the real estate landscape of the region.
