Rising Star Vinod victorious in Pin Fernando Trophy final

Shirani prevails to win Pam Fernando Trophy 2017:
The Pin & Pam Fernando Trophy 2017 Finals worked off at the Ridgeways, Royal Colombo Golf Club Course on Friday, saw two enthralling matches followed by some eager Golfers.
Vinod Weerasinghe, a rising star of Sri Lanka Golf, joined a select band of Pin Fernando Trophy winners, displaying a solid match temperament, but above all, good steady Golf. Vinod, playing off a 4 Handicap, had to give 10 strokes to Tyronne Weerackody in the Final, but Vinod withstood the early pressure of giving a stroke per hole in the first 5 holes. Tyronne managed to win the 1st hole, lost the 4th even with a stroke and was All square after 5. Then Vinod got in to top gear with no strokes given for the next five holes and quickly built up a 4 up lead after 10. Vinod lost the 11th to a stroke but immediately stretched the lead to be dormie 5 up playing the 14th. Tyrone pulled back one by winning the 14th but Vinod halved the 15th to seal the Match and lift the Pin Fernando Trophy 2017, 4 & 3.
The Pam Fernando Trophy Final was more closely fought, with Niranjalee Amarasuriya taking an early 3 up lead after 5 holes but Shirani Buffin clawed her way back winning the 6th, 8th and 10th to be All Square. Shirani won the 11th to lead 1 up for the first time in the match but immediately lost the 12th to square the match again. Shirani won the15th & 16th to be dormie 2 up but lost the 17th to play the final hole 1 up. Shirani kept her cool and won the 18th to be victorious in a well-played final between high handicap lady golfers. The Pam Fernando Trophy in memory of the outstanding achievements of the Late Pam, who holds the World Guinness Book of Records to date as the oldest to win a National title.
The Prize Giving was held at the conclusion of the Finals and Priath Fernando representing UTE – CAT Solar, Sponsors of the prestigious RCGC Board Event Pin Fernando Trophy & the Pam Fernando Trophy, gave away the Semi-finalists prizes. The Main Trophies were handed over by Sunil Udalagama representing the RCGC as the host Club of the event in memory of the legendary Pin Fernando. The Pin Fernando Trophy inaugurated in the RCGC Centenary year 1979, has been played consecutively since and boasts of an excellent band of golfers, especially single figure handicappers, to which Vinod Weerasinghe is a great addition having won the 2017 edition of the Pin Fernando Trophy, off a 4 handicap.
