World Hearing Day, today

Today is World Hearing Day and International Ear Care Day.
This year’s theme is ‘Action for hearing loss: make a sound investment,’ Colombo National Hospital ENT Unit Head Consultant ENT Surgeon Dr. Chandra Jayasuriya said.
Addressing the press at the Colombo National Hospital ENT Unit yesterday, she said that about 400 infants born in Sri Lanka are suffering from hearing defects, annually. Infants born with hearing defects can be completely cured. They can be cured if treated early. Early detection saves lives, she said.
According to Dr. Jayasuriya, Sri Lanka is one of the few countries that carry out millions of rupees worth cochlear implant surgery, free of charge.
“We need to get rid of negative attitudes towards those wearing hearing aids,” she said.
Dr. Lakshman Gamlath said infants should be treated for hearing defects as early as possible since speech development ends at age five. Children speak only if they hear. Therefore, we have to make them hear before they turn five, he said.
