US candidates embrace cafe campaigning

US: Shortly after Hillary Clinton announced her presidential bid in April, her debut campaign stop was a coffee shop in small-town Iowa, an American custom that endures despite mega-events and the growing influence of digital politicking.
Every US presidential hopeful in the last century has likely engaged in the cafe or diner ritual, and nowhere more assiduously than Iowa and New Hampshire, the two states that vote first in the drawn-out battles to decide the nominees for the Democratic and Republican parties.
The 20 men and women currently seeking the White House have already repeated the cliched, but necessary, campaign trail protocol dozens of times.
Like Republican Senator Lindsey Graham did Saturday at the Good News Room Coffeehouse in Boone, Iowa, they slide into a booth next to patrons as they sip coffee or enjoy their bacon deluxe breakfast, and take the pulse of an electorate in America's early voting states.
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie huddled with locals at the Pink Cadillac Diner in Rochester, New Hampshire two days after launching his 2016 campaign, while rival Mike Huckabee pressed the flesh early this month at Dodici Cafe in Iowa.
The humble tradition bumps up against the digital age, which rivals the space carved out by retail politics.
The race is playing out feverishly online, where candidates retweet supporters, use live-stream apps, post video clips on YouTube, and claim to connect with Facebook followers.
But nothing takes the place of a candidate's face-to-face encounters with everyday voters over a hot cup of joe.
"It's the last real vetting process in America," Graham told AFP after an hour-long Q&A session with about a dozen voters at the wood-panelled Boone cafe.
"The diner is a place to look somebody in the eye. You can't do that on social media."
