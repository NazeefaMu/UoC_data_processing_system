International financial city in Colombo: 28 pc reclamation work completed

The construction within the international financial city (Port City) in Colombo will commence in 2018, project officers told the Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka.
Minister Ranawaka made an inspection tour at the construction site on Thursday to discuss the progress and future plans with regard to the project. The China Harbour Engineering Company representatives informed the minister that 28 percent of reclamation work has been completed, adding that it could be completed by the end of this year.
The minister said the financial city in Colombo would be made the Asian regional hub with special trade and economic facilities. A highway connecting this city with Katunayake will also be built. The area adjacent to Beira Lake will be developed as a business district. The area surrounding the Fort Railway station will be developed as a large scale transport hub within the next three years.
The minister stressed the garbage generated in the city will not be passed to the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC), nor the water needed to construct the city would be taken from the CMC.
“This Financial City is the largest development project now in progress in Sri Lanka. Even though it is a new experience for Sri Lanka, the officials are working hard to make it a huge success while paying closer attention to the environmental concerns” he said.
