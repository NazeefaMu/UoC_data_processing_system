Deepika calls Aishwarya the torchbearer

Deepika Padukone’s Hollywood debut is the much talked about topic in town. The actress is now finally back after wrapping up the shoot of the film and is now busy making appearances and promoting her brands.
When asked about her competitor Priyanka Chopra, Deepika said that it is Aishwarya Rai Bachchan who should get recognition first. “She, for me, is the torchbearer for putting India on the global map. But everyone who has managed to break through into the western market — whether it is Anil, Irfan, Priyanka, or myself — I think we have all done a great job,” she said.
She even added, “We got this opportunity at a time when all of us are working towards breaking stereotypes. We are all focused on being part of good content, and to be cast in films based on our talent and not because of the colour of our skin.”
