POC unaware of Hambantota Port Concessionary Agreement content: Chamal

The Hambantota Port Concessionary Agreement has not been referred to the Parliamentary Oversight Committee, UPFA MP Chamal Rajapaksa said.
He said as of the standard practice, the Parliamentary Oversight Committee on Transport and Communication chaired by him should have been made aware of the content of the Agreement prior to approving it. He noted that he was not informed of the content of the Agreement despite his initial involvement in discussions to resolve the land related matters in Hambantota. “I made a number of proposals in this regard, but I am yet to receive feedback,” he said.
Commenting on the undervaluation of the lands, the MP pointed out that a special land valuation must be carried out in Hambantota, as the land value in the area has increased considerably over the past years.
“The other problem is where to find alternative lands to resettle evacuated families. They cannot be simply asked to go elsewhere,” he added.
