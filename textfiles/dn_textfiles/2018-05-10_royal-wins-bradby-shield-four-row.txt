Royal wins Bradby Shield four in a row

Royal proved there is intelligence and strength in their rugby by taking Trinity to the brink in their second meeting of this year’s Bradby second leg played at Pallekele. Class and experience will tell every time in any game, from what was seen last on Saturday in the second of the annual Bradby Shield rugby fixtures, Royal had both. They won both games comfortably.
This match was one of the best schools games seen at this venue this season. From the word ‘go’ the boys went at it like men possessed. It was indeed a rousing match. It left the large crowd very satisfied.
Hundreds of Royal fanatics walked out of Pallekele grounds happily, after their favourite school gave off a good performance to beat Trinity in a hard fought game 27-19. With the win Royal made it four in a row and the tally now stands at TCK 39 wins, RC 33 and 2 Ties.
It was a solid win for Royal in what was a very enjoyable game, even if Trinity couldn’t quite go the distance. Trinity had a very good second half, but will rue a few silly defensive errors (don’t buy dummies). The rain which came down before the kickoff made conditions slippery in the first quarter. Later the weather was superb for rugby.
Royal who are in the top of the Division I, at the end of the first round, scored their fifth win in a row. They put in a lot of effort and copped a lot of grief and gave it everything, the proudest would have been the Royal head coach for the effort they put in.
Trinity in this game owned possession for much of the second half. They rode the tackles, found a way to continue under immense pressure and built their game, but the match winning luck eluded them. It was a sign of how good a team they have become - composed and resilient as well as skilled and intelligent.
In this game Royal had the edge on Trinity. They had a heavier pack, and their back line went in for short, crisp, passes, the sort of passes that the forwards could join in on – and they often did. These things made Trinity’s job tough. In the first half Royal had more of the exchanges and in the second half Trinity dominated. This made the match a most exciting one.
In terms of physique, both schools were equal, and Royal and Trinity were in good form. Trinity made a great impact, though they lost, they were good in ball handling; they had the power and knowledge of rugby, but failed to drive home the advantage. For Royal the victory was a well-earned one where the entire team should be proud of the performance.
C.E. Simithrachchi trophy under 18
Royal who won the first leg in Colombo scored a splendid win over Trinity 13 points to 8 in their Simithrachchi trophy 2nd leg rugger match played at Pallekele and hour before the senior game. It was a rousing game and one of the best under 18 matches seen.
At half time Royal led 8-3. It was Royal forwards who won them the match., They were outstanding in the loose play, getting behind the ball fast and tackling well. Their bustling game completely upset the Trinity forwards who could not win the ball however hard they tried. Royal halves worked well, scrum half slinging out his passes accurately and standoff opening out the game on the defensive.
Under 16
Trinity under 16 rugger fifteen who lost the first leg to Royal 19-21, lost the 2nd too 0-10. In this leg Trinity gave one of their best performances for the season although beaten. Royal were exceptional in the first half, with the help of a penalty to lead 3-0 at half-time.
The Royal three-quarters were far superior to the Trinity in attack. The losers back division made up for this defect to some extent by resolute tackling. The line-outs and scrums were even. The losing team’s fly half, made plenty of opening for his line, but the insides were far too slow, with the result was that their wing threes were always bottled up.
Presentation
The 1981 Trinity College rugby skipper Ravi Bandaranayake was the chief guest at the event and handed the Bradby Shield and the Simithrachchi Cup to the two Royal captains - Shabith Feroze and Migara Mithushanka.
