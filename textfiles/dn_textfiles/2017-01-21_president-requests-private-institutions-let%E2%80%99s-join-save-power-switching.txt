President requests private institutions: Let’s join to save power by switching off lights used for advertising, decorations

President Maithripala Sirisena requested all private institutions to help save power by switching off lights used for advertising and decorations at their institutions.
The President pointed out that the country has to face a power crisis in the future due to the drought and therefore it is the responsibility of all to use the power in an economical manner from now.
A huge amount of power is utilised for advertising boards and other decorative electrical systems used by private institutions at nights, for their advertising purposes. Through limitation of this usage, a significant amount of power consumption of the country could be saved, the President pointed out.
He requested everyone to support the initiative until the drought ends.
