Plunderers of State property will be severely dealt with: Amaraweera

Those who plunder State property and lead luxurious lives will taste prison rice in the near future, said Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development and Mahaweli Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera.
He said so addressing a meeting at the resident project manager’s office at Embilipitiya.
The minister was on an inspection tour in the Mahaweli zone area.
The minister said some State officials who plundered State property have already lost their jobs. He said State property is similar to poojas for the Maha Sangha.
Plundered State property will be confiscated, he said adding that he had the opportunity to glance through several files of a corrupt Mahaweli official and found that he sold billions of rupees worth Mahaweli land. His services had been terminated.
The minister added that the person had asked a certain businessman to provide him his BMW car because he had given him land over the value of the car.
“Such corrupt officials will be dealt with severely according to law,” he said.
“Some people ask whether we have nabbed corrupt officials and politicians. This cannot be done in a haphazard manner. We have to follow the rules and regulations. The custodians of law will look into it,” the minister said.
