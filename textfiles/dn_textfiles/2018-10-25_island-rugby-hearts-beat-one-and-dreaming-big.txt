Island rugby hearts that beat as one and dreaming big!

Rugby traditions throughout the Asia Pacific islands are wonderfully peculiar, distinct, remarkable and a glorious dialect shared by all who live the code.
The Sri passion for the game links us closer than we imagine with Japan, Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Vanavatu, Cook Islands, Papua New Guinea, Guam etc...
We all speak rugby and live that extreme Spartan discipline despite our obvious geography and cultures.
Rugby links us and is almost an umbilical framework of shared ambitions.
It really is up to all these amazing island unions to join hands for the future of our game.
The need is both technical and financially a most viable blueprint for success without too much stress.
How fantastic for all these islands to initiate their own island 7s series for men and women, plus a 15s tournament that captures the imagination.
Junior rugby from U15 up will hugely impact the quality, skill levels and confidence of our Sri game right across all grades, and all formats.
Let’s just cast the mind’s eye and morph into an operational tours agreement for 7s and 15s.
The dream for island rugby is too fabulous and massively needed, especially for Sri Lanka’s future in the game and our Asian performance platform.
Our Sri islanders have to grade up and new bottle to face our delightful skilled island brothers and sisters.
Let’s hope the big pencils that occupy the long halls of fame...see the wisdom in our future skill levels that automatically grow confidence like breathing fresh oxygen.
Consider our 7s teams on an island series ...2020 ideal to start.
We set a 12 team 7s in Fiji or Samoa with a return leg in Sri Lanka.
An invitation format that gives the likes of Muthu, Sooriyabandara, Danushka Ranjan, Naveen Heenak, Jason, Gayan Weeray, Dixon, Dinuk, Shenal, Sudam, Kavindu, Omalka etc.
Grit, guts, courage, total survival on their skills under pressure...lining up against, Samoa, Cook Islands, Tonga...then Fiji and Japan etc...
Think impact, skills, learning and pure survival.
Our 7s upgrades in one swoop...no passengers, no baggage.
Initially mega tough, but the learning and pressure ...pure platinum for our players to adapt adjust and step up on extreme survival.
Our Asian ranking for both ...too static and seemingly stuck for the last 5 years.
Time to cut away from conventional dull thinking ...new energy, new strategy, new practical thinking and definitely the only way forward.
Our 7s men and women need heaps of exposure to sharpen reaction response etc....and develop their abilities under pressure.
Not only are players and teams forced to adapt.
Coaching staff and management under pressure too.
We are far too predictable...both in attack and defence.
Our running lines, support play and finishing, far too straight for my deckchair expert pondering.
Grab the best stats of the top 5 in the world...and familiar ability for spontaneous punishment when opponents hesitate or make mistakes.
Couple this with their relentless fitness and huge recovery ...max finishing is a telling fact of simple confidence and empowering hunger to be the best.
Sri Lanka rugby, I believe is on the brink of world recognition.
This generation is uniquely positioned to strike at the heart of that hallowed sanctum.
Time to back our ambitions with special clout.
Enough praise for the champion nations...good timing for our skills to command respect and shine...shine...shine.
Bula bula Sri api and the new dream for our warriors.
