Call for radical change of LGs

Local Government (LG) institutions in the country should undergo radical changes to convert them to efficient, effective and productive units aiming to cater to the needs of the people, Prof. Sarath Wijesooriya said.
He said unlike Sri Lanka, well-organised productive LG institutions are seen in most developed countries.
He was addressing a public discussion held under the theme ‘Purawesi Sabhawa’ at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Centre yesterday.
The gathering raised questions to five candidates, who are to contest for Mayorship of the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) at the forthcoming LG polls representing five political parties of the mainstream.
Speaking on the CMC, Prof. Wijesooriya said the Colombo city should be converted to a developed city with a vision and an action plan. When reaching this goal, attention should be drawn on many other sectors including health, education, hygiene, environmental and so on. Besides, it is important to wipe out drug menace, he said.
He said it is reported that the CMC has become more corrupt as stakeholders have to bribe to get things done. Moreover, issues related to health, education and hygiene etc. should be addressed. Then persons, who are elected to the CMC, should pay attention to these issues and convert the CMC to a people-friendly institute.
It is important to address the issue of street children and drug menace, while increasing the living standard of the Colombo people.
When asked whether the Mayoral candidates have productive solutions for garbage management, which has become a huge burden, all candidates said they have a proper mechanism relating to garbage management. The candidates claimed they and their political party have good solutions for issues relating to health, education, infrastructure, garbage management and more.
