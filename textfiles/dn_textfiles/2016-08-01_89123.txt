Mathews credits young Mendis for team turn around

PALLEKELE: Skipper Angelo Mathews credited 21-year-old Kusal Mendis for Sri Lanka’s change of fortunes when they came out of a poor rut in international cricket to pull off a stunning 106-run win over the world no. 1 ranked Test team Australia in the first Test which ended at Pallekele International Stadium on Saturday.
“After a rough, tough six to eight months we needed that victory which will give us a lot of confidence going forward,” said Mathews at the post-match press conference. “As a young team it was a great performance, especially after the first day of play we were disappointing with our batting but credit should go to the young man Kusal Mends who batted brilliantly to get his maiden Test century against a very strong Australian team.”
The Test looked like following the same pattern as the series in England when Sri Lanka batting first after winning the toss were bundled out for a miserly 117. Australia took a handy first innings lead of 86 runs and Sri Lanka were again in trouble at six for two wickets when Mendis walked in.
For the next five hours and 19 minutes the Australians who were on top at that stage had to simply watch helplessly as Mendis slowly but surely took the game away from them by piecing out a classic innings of 176.
“Especially playing his first Test against Australia, he showed a lot of class and a lot of temperament,” said Mathews. “It was not easy to bat on that wicket. It was turning rapidly and their bowlers were bowling well and fast as well. The way he played, he made it look so easy. Most of us were struggling to get runs. The way he batted, I’m very excited for the future.”
Sri Lanka rode on Mendis’ brilliant knock to score 353 in their second innings. No one made more than 42 in the innings. But Sri Lanka had a total to bowl at the Aussies who required 268 to chase on a wearing pitch that was not easy for batting. The strong Australian batting line up crumbled for 161 to hand out to Sri Lanka a 107-run win.
“It was a collective effort. We had to rally around Kusal. He was batting the best out of the lot. We needed a 200+ lead on that wicket, which was assisting the spinners,” said Mathews. “Rangana Herath once again proved his brilliance. (Lakshan) Sandakan coming into his first game – it was a brilliant effort by him. Overall it was a very pleasing effort but still a long way to go in the series.
“I was just told that we have beaten Australia after 17 years. That’s very pleasing. Credit should go to the whole team the way they fought and showed their character. Whether it’s at home or away we had to play our best cricket to beat the Aussies, and we did. Especially after the first day we had to come back hard and strong and we did that.”
However victory didn’t come on a platter to the Lankans as they were made to fight hard and earn it. The game seemed as good as over when Australia slumped to 157-8, but for the next one and a half hours Sri Lanka could not separate their ninth wicket pair Peter Nevill and Steve O’Keefe who put up staunch resistance not by way of runs but by consuming valuable time adding a mere four runs for the ninth wicket off 178 balls. They had a reason for not running the singles and two’s because O’Keefe came to bat with a hamstring injury and was unable to run.
“O Keefe and Nevill made us work extremely hard for the wicket. We had to keep bowling and be patient,” said Mathews. “Obviously we were a bit worried about the weather as well. Fortunately the weather gods didn’t prevent us from winning. We just had to do our basics right. Rangana was bowling brilliantly right throughout the match, and Sandakan also. We were very hungry to take those couple of wickets and we eventually did.”
The stand was eventually ended not by Herath or Sandakan but by another debutant Dhananjaya de Silva who had Nevill caught behind.
Reflecting back on the win Mathews said that the injury to fast bowler Suranga Lakmal was a ‘blessing in disguise’ because had he got through a fitness test on the morning of the match there was a great likelihood of Sandakan being left out.
