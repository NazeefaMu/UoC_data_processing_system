Dengue on the  rise in Ampara

Dengue fever is on the rise again in the Ampara District coastal areas. Addalaichenai MOH Dr.A.L. Alawdeen said during the past 27 days, 26 fever patients have been admitted to the hospital, out of which 20 were found positive for dengue.
He said that in the Addalaichenai area dengue larvae were predominantly found in the 5th, 9th and the 10th divisions where most of the patients were found.
Dengue prevention activities have been stepped up in the affected areas with fumigation and inspection of dwellings, public places and drains.
Mosquito control activities in the Addalaichenai and Akkaraipattu DS divisions have made rapid progress.
The MOH offices, Divisional Secretariats, Akkaraipattu Police Station and Pradeshiya Sabhas have launched a dengue prevention programme in Addalaichenai and Akkaraipattu Divisional Secretariat areas. Following this, programmes are being carried out to eradicate dengue in all grama niladari divisions.
Dr Alawdeen requested the public to keep their properties clean.
