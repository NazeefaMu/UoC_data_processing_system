HR violation probe during war: Sri Lanka does not need international intervention

Sri Lanka does not require any international intervention in a probe into human rights violations during the war period, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
The minister said this during an inspection tour of the new fish processing centre built by the Ceylon Fisheries Corporation on Wednesday. He was responding to a question raised by the media about his views on Sarath Weerasekara's recent request for an appointment of international judges for a panel to investigate human rights violations committed by the LTTE during the war period.
He said Sri Lanka does not want international judges or a hybrid court to conduct investigations into alleged violations since it has an independent courts network and a team of prestigious and talented local judges to conduct any such probe. He said that such an investigation if any can be conducted through a local mechanism.
Amaraweera said Sarath Weerasekara or anyone else in the Joint Opposition had not sought an opportunity to participate in the main UNHRC sessions in Geneva. Group meetings are held in about 50 rooms in the centre. Weerasekara had attended one such committee meeting rather than the main sessions. Anyone could attend those small committees because certain NGOs provide every facility including free air tickets. The government rejects the request by Weerasekara to internationalise the probe into human rights violation during the war period, the minister said.
