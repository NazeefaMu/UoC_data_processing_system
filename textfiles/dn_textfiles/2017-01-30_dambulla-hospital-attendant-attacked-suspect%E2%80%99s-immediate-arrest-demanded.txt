Dambulla hospital attendant attacked, suspect’s immediate arrest demanded

Dambulla Base Hospital minor staff stopped work on Saturday demanding immediate arrest of a suspect who attacked an attendant of the hospital. The suspect had attacked the attendant and took away a patient forcibly on Saturday due to a delay of treatment. The injured attendant was hospitalised.
The strike was temporally suspended on the promise given by police of an immediate arrest of the suspect.
Police investigations revealed that a person was assaulted by a three wheeler driver at Dambulla economic centre and the assaulted had been taken to the hospital by another person, and he had attacked the attendant in a ward.
The hospital employees demanded the suspect be taken into custody within 24 hours. Failure of the arrest would restart the strike, they said.
Dambulla police are investigating.
