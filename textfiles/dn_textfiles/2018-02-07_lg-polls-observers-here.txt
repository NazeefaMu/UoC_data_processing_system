LG polls observers here

A delegation of ten Asian election observers will be here to monitor the February 10 local government polls, a senior Election Commission official said yesterday.
The team includes four observers from India, two from Maldives, two from Indonesia and two from the Association of World Election Bodies headquartered in South Korea.
The Indian delegation will be headed by Chief Electoral Officer of Gujarat and the Indonesian team will be representing Komisi Pemilihan Umum (KPU), the country's general election commission. The Maldivian team is headed by a Commissioner of the Maldivian Election Commission.
"The teams will be travelling islandwide covering pre-election period, the election day and the post election period to compile a report to be handed over to the Election Commission on their observations subsequently," the official said.
The Maldivian team has already arrived in the country and the others are expected to reach Colombo within the next couple of days.The upcoming Local Government Polls will be the biggest election to be held in Sri Lanka and also the first time after decades the LG election is held on a single day. Previously it was held on a staggered basis.
