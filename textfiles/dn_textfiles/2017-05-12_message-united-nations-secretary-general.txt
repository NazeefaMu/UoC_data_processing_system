Message from the United Nations Secretary-General

 

I send my warmest wishes to all those celebrating the Day of Vesak in honour of the birth of Lord Buddha. Everyone can draw inspiration from his journey. Born a sheltered prince, Shakyamuni went out into the world to confront and overcome human suffering. As one sutra states, “Because all living beings are subject to illness, I am ill as well.”
This message of compassion is timeless. In our interconnected world, there can be no peace as long as others are in peril; no security as long as others suffers deprivation; no sustainable future until all members of our human family enjoys their human rights. On this Day of Vesak, let us celebrate the wisdom of Lord Buddha by taking action for others with a strong spirit of solidarity.
