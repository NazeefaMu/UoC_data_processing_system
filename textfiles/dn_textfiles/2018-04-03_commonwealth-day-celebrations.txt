Commonwealth Day celebrations

Students of Amal International School, Colombo 6, participated in a very colourful, creative and resourceful intra -school poster competition on March 12 to celebrate Commonwealth Day in keeping with the theme “Towards A Common Future”.
Students of grades five to 11 had hands on experience collating information regarding fifty three Commonwealth countries using the Internet, Encyclopedias, Atlas, Magazines, Periodicals, Newspapers etc. The posters were very different from each other. Each poster displayed an explosion of creativity with uniqueness. There was a blast of colour splashed in different hues and shades to dazzle each poster.
Students had encapsulated a wealth of information of the fifty three Commonwealth countries displaying maps, location, heads of states, national flag, flower, animal, population, religions, rate of literacy, economy, currency, sports and special features, The students displayed incredible talents in organizing the event. All the participants will be awarded certificates of participation. The first six winners of each grade from five to eleven will be awarded cash prizes together with a certificate.
“This year’s exhibition was well organized and the students had really excelled in their creativity.
The Posters were awesome! “Towards a Common Future” was a delightful insight to all. I applaud the participants and organizers and wish them all the best,” said Deputy Principal A. R.Mihlar. “Though this project was organized by me, it would not have been a success without the support of my colleagues. I am happy that this project was appreciated and successful,” said Chandra Hettiaratchy, the Librarian of the school. The students said that the event was an incredible overwhelming experience to gather information of fifty three Commonwealth states at a glance.
“We gained a lot of knowledge. A splendid piece of work by our fellow school mates,” they said.
This project is an annual event organized by Chandra Hettiaratchy with the assistance of Fareeda Alimohamed under the guidance of the school Principal M M Shazuly.
