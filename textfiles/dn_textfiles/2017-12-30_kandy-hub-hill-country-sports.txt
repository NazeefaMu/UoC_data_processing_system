KANDY SPORTS ROUND UP :
Kandy - hub of Hill country sports

As another year comes to an end it is an appropriate time to take a look at sports development in Kandy. Over the years Kandy has established a proud record of having produced some of the top most sportsmen/sportswomen in the field of rugby, cricket, football, swimming, hockey, athletics, table tennis, iron sports, boxing, swimming, basketball, golf and recently baseball, which is a new sport that has been introduced. The sporting fraternity of Kandy hopes that Minister Lakshman Kiriella, a sports lover who is residing in Kandy, and keen to developing sports should help the young sportsmen and women by using his initiative to find solutions on how to provide better facilities for all sports in the district. He has plans to upgrade Bogambara stadium to international level. Although Kandy has several sports bodies they need to get actively involved at the highest levels. Kandy’s urgent need is proper ground facilities for cricket, hockey and athletics. During the time when the Bogambara Stadium was under the Municipal Council, sports flourished in Kandy. The respective sports bodies were able to pocket out the ground fee, but today the ground fee is sky high, more than what it was under the MC. The sporting fraternity of Kandy has appealed to the new Sports Minister to give a helping hand.
Rugby
Today the oval ball sport is undoubtedly the most popular in Kandy with one “A” division club Kandy Sports Club, which was founded in 1874 dominating as the reigning club champions in the league and knockout. This has boosted the sport in every corner of the district with all schools taking up to the game. Trinity, Kingswood, St. Anthony's, Dharmaraja, St. Sylvester's, Sri Sumangala, Sri Rahula, and Vidyartha have done well in schools rugby. Most of the Kandy club players represent the national team as well. Kandy SC is the kings of local rugby and this year too are close to maintaining that tag. The Kingswoodians won the all-island under 18 championships. Today there is a well-organised Academy called Kandy Rugby Academy which holds coaching sessions every Saturday morning at Bogambara Stadium to help youngsters.
Football
Football has been tagged the common man's game, at one time and was a powerhouse of Sri Lanka club football. But today it is in a forgotten state. When will the game of football regain its former glory in the historic city of Kandy? Today no one seems to care for football in the hill capital which has a history of nearly 100 years. The game is sadly neglected. For many years, tournaments and AGM’s have not been held on time in an organized manner. This has been a great setback to the sport. Sad to say in the last couple of years football has gone ‘off side’ and most of the players are losing interest as there is no recognition nor any support or encouragement to take this game forward. At club level it is dead. The schools are playing the game as usual but overall Kandy football is dead and virtually buried.
Cricket
At school level the sport continues to take pride of place, though the club standards have dropped somewhat. Here again the contributing factor has been the lack of resources and facilities and poor organizing. This year the Kandy DCA and CPCA have brought in cricket promoters and they are doing their best. A few days back Kandy CC won the Central Province Governor’s trophy.
Hockey
In Kandy hockey at both boys and girls school level is quite healthy and successful, especially girls’ schools dominating the game. KDHA affairs at club level have been unsuccessful and non-operational. A herculean effort is urgently required if club hockey in Kandy is to see its former glory days. It is sad to note that hockey has taken a back seat at club level.
Cue Sport
Billiards and snooker have taken a nosedive with hardly any activity. It was a sport which was once dominated by Kandy clubs. Only Mahanuwara YMBA keeps the sport going, other clubs like Kandy Club, Kandy Garden Club, and Kandy YMMA have forgotten to switch the table lights. Now it is a parlor game. Only during the AGM of the controlling body, the lights come on.
Basketball
Basketball has got back to its former glory and recently Kandy conducted a very successful inter-district tournament. The schools are giving a big boost to restart the game in a better fashion. It was in 1964 that basketball was introduced. The first ever tournament in Kandy was held in1965 for men and women. In the early days Kandy YMCA gave a big hand.
Table Tennis
In Kandy this game was very popular. There is some hope as there are many schools and clubs who are capable of doing well. The late D.H de Silva when he was Municipal Commissioner gave good support. Today most of the schools are doing well, especially Vidyartha College. At one time Municipal Council gave a big hand for the sport through their community centers.
Badminton
There is somewhat a lack of interest in this sport. Something must be done to uplift the game.
There are not many coaches and should the schools take to the sport the game can pick up. In badminton Kandy has produced national level champions and continues to do so.
Lawn Tennis
One-time it was a very popular sport in Kandy. It was Kandy Lawn Cub, Kandy Garden Club, University of Peradeniya and Kandy Police who took to the sport during DIG Bodi Liyanage's time. Schools like Trinity, Girls High School and Hillwood were involved in a big way.
Swimming
Mahamaya Girls have dominated the sport by winning many meets. Trinity and Hillwood Girls have also excelled in the water sport.
Boxing
This sport remains popular among the schools. One time king makers of the sport were Trinity College later St. Sylvester's College followed by Peradeniya MMV and Sarasavi Uyana. Of late schools like Vidyartha, Kingswsood and Dharmaraja, have taken to the sport and are doing well. In the good old days Kandy YMCA gave a big hand for boxing and helped the sport.
Wrestling
This sport was at its best at club level especially Kandy YMCA that promoted it. It is good to see Walala A Ratnayake Central doing well. They won the Junior Nationals recently.
Iron Sport
Kandy YMCA gave a big hand for iron sport (body building and weightlifting) and helped several iron sportsmen to do well and bring honor to the country.
Baseball
This sport is catching up fast, and some of the schools are keen to promote it thanks to the efforts of the promoters.
Golf
A sport which is popular mainly due to the promotion given by the Golf Club in Digana. They have tournaments that are well supported by sponsorships.
Volleyball
The sport is over 100 years old in the country and 77 years old in Kandy. It is the national sport, and at a certain time volleyball was a popular game. Today the much needed support is not there for the game. If the proper backing is given this game too, should be in the news.
Netball
Schools in Kandy are doing well in this sport and have taken part in most of the tournaments organized by the governing body.
It was Kandy Girls High School who started the sport first followed by Hillwood College.
Today most of the schools are in the game but with poor backing from the governing body.
Athletics
All schools in Kandy have athletics in their curriculum and are doing very well in this field.
At present all schools, boys and girls are performing well.
Sylvestrians produced a top athlete who represented the country in hurdles. Walala A. Ratnayake Central won several meets.
In the first three months of the year it is sports meet of all schools which is the most looked forward to sporting event where old boys and girls gather in camaraderie.
Cycling
Cycling has been popular in Kandy and there have been races on many occasions. For it to be competitive there has to be sponsorship which is lacking.
Chess
Chess has been popular at schools for quite a long period. Last year Trinity became All-Island champions.
Dharmaraja, Kingswood, Vidyartha, Sri Sumangala, St. Sylvester's and St. Anthony's did their best among the boy's schools. Mahamaya, Hillwood, High School, Pushpadana, Swarnamali, Hemamali and Seetha Devi did well in the girls tournaments.
Softball Cricket
It is very popular every Sunday and on public holidays when tournaments for various trophies are played. It is one of the most interesting and well represented sporting event by both sexes.
Carrom
A popular sport in Kandy, mostly played by the government departments.
This is a re-creation sport. Kandy's Carrom Association gives a big hand to promote the sport.
A N M Ameer who was attached to Sri Lanka Air Force was an outstanding carrom player who secured second place at the last Striker Cash Carrom Tournament where 112 competitors participated.
He is an old boy of St. Sylvester’s’ College. Carrom today is promoted in a big way especially in schools.
