Fraud case against Aluthgamage:
Trial fixed for February 27

The Colombo High Court fixed a case filed against Parliamentarian Mahindananda Aluthgamage for allegedly purchasing a house worth Rs.27 million with illegally-acquired money for February 27, next year. The house is on Kynsey Road, Colombo 7.
The Attorney-General had filed indictments against MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage, alleging that he had purchased a house from an individual called Christopher Roshan.
He alleged that the accused had failed to disclose how he was able to raise the money for the purchase of the house and added that he had committed an offence that comes under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act's Sections 3 and 4.
The complaint was lodged by Voice Against Corruption Convener Wasantha Samarasinghe.
