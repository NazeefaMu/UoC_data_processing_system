How fast will law fight Bond issue?

President Maithripala Sirisena was in the spotlight of both governance and politics with his announcement recommendations of the Presidential Commission on the Treasury bond issue, and its call that all related offenders be brought to book. He stood above the stature of political party leaders engaged in the current local government poll campaign, while being such a leader himself, as he informed the public of the results of a probe into what is certainly the largest show of corruption in recent years, and gave some strength to his pledge to fight corruption in his campaign as the Common Candidate in the Presidential poll of January 2015.
The fact that the Treasury bond issue is of relevance in the current local government poll campaign was seen by the call for the Commission report to be tabled in Parliament by the Joint Opposition (JO), the JVP, and SLFP members, too. The President who certainly knew of the political stuff of this report, especially in this rising electoral campaign, had already effectively gained on the call and need for public knowledge of the Commission’s findings, when he stated: “especially I would like to mention that this final report must be presented to the Parliament and through this initiative the report must be open to the public.” He added that in the future, necessary as well as legal steps in this regard will be taken expeditiously according to the advice from the Attorney General. He requested to consider the openness of the facts of this Commission Report and assured that no hesitation would occur in filing cases against the offenders.
The President’s statement on the Report with the highlight of the losses to the country, especially the Employees’ Provident Fund, other State funding sources such as the Mahapola Scholarship Fund, National Savings Bank and Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation, losing more than Rs 8000 millions in secondary bond auctions, and the larger loss to the Government of Rs 1,1145 million, is certainly a major exposure that will have its impact on public opinion, and certainly influence voter thinking, especially in the urban centres of the local poll.
Load on UNP?
While the load of the Commission’s findings would certainly fall on the UNP, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has been cleared by the Commission on the appointment of Arjun Mahendran as Governor, Central Bank, although it was noted that the PM was too reliant on statements by Mahendran on Treasury bond issues.
However, the record of Arjun Mahenran’s conduct as Governor of the CBSL, especially with regard to Treasury bond auctions, his relations with Perpetual Treasuries Ltd, with its association with his son-in-law Arjun Aloysius, certainly remains a cloud over the UNP, which it will now have to fight against, especially in the urban areas, in the rising poll campaign.
Notably, this Bond issue report does not stand out very well with both the SLFP and its direct rival today - the Mahinda Rajapaksa led SLPP, as it will lead to renewed debates on the fight against corruption, which was the pledge of the Unity Coalition of the UNP and SLFP, as well as the revival of interest through this report on the fraud and corruption of the Rajapaksa regime.
It is also important to note that the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to investigate and inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC) has also presented its report to the President, which largely involves situations under the previous government, and there is now the necessity to proceed with the legal and other actions on those recommendations, too. If done with speed, this can certainly pose major problems for the SLPP and the Mahinda Rajapaksa team campaign on an issue of corruption against the mainstream SLFP and UNP that are in government today, and are the poll rivals of the SLPP.
President Sirisena did make a politically important observation in stating: “I must specially mention, in the future when filing cases, according to the recommendations and information of these Commissions, individuals who belong to two main political parties will be defendants in the legal process. We must be happy over our independent and impartial Judiciary. I must state all of us will provide our maximum support for this process”.
The legal process
President Sirisena has already submitted the Treasury bond issue report to the Attorney-General, with the Commission recommending that the criminal and civil court action must be taken through the Criminal Investigations Department and the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption. That is certainly a politically useful statement. But what is of larger importance is how long it will take for the necessary legal action to be taken. A major problem faced by this government is what is seen as the delay in legal action on issues of corruption and fraud by the last government.
There has been only one major judgment so far in this regard, and that was against two public officers on the ‘sil redi' issue. The politicians involved made big noises after that, and even the Sangha was brought to ridicule with ‘pinda paatha’ for cash to pay fines imposed by the Court. No politicians of the former regime have yet been seriously affected by the functioning of the law against corruption. We see a mockery of justice in the fines imposed on those who have not declared their assets. It is now seen that some of these political figures are ready to use and even manipulate the law, through the available access to the judiciary (unlike in the past) to delay and obstruct legal action against them.
There is not much room for doubt that members of the former government, now with the SLPP, and members of the SLFP with today’s government, have both contributed to these delays and manipulations of the legal process. It must also be noted that the Ministry of Justice remains with the UNP. If there is to be speedy action on the Bond issues, to recover the monies due to the Government, and bring the necessary legal punishments to those responsible for these corrupt actions, there will be the need for special action for the speedy passage of required legislation through parliament (with the necessary time for legal objections in Court) and the organisation of the Attorney-General’s Department with the personnel and facilities to follow up with speedy action.
There is much that has to be done with speed, if this Treasury Bond Probe Report is to have its full impact, in terms of the fight against corruption. This includes the call for a forensic audit of Central Bank Treasury Bond transactions from 2008 onwards, to bring out possible earlier frauds, and reorganising of the Audit Department. Moves to restructure the Central Bank, Public Debt Dept., and direct issuance of Treasury Bonds, and the recovery of illegally obtained profits of Perpetual Treasuries, and whatever action that could be taken against former Governor Arjun Mahendran, too.
There is also the recommendation for necessary legal action under the Bribery Laws against former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake (RK), over the penthouse obtained with funds from Arjun Aloysius (which RK was not aware of!), and allegations that RK had given false evidence before the Commission.
A tough challenge
This is certainly no easy task for any government, especially for one that is clearly divided within, in the current battle for the local government bodies. The President has gained a big plus by his statement on the Treasury bond issues. But, the question that arose about delays in fighting the corruption of the Rajapaksa Regime will be revived unless speedy and effective action is taken to implement the recommendations of the Presidential Commission, which is action under the legal process.
In a country where the Legal Process has been seen and largely condemned for its large, inordinate and often deliberately managed delays, raising some questions about the independence of the judiciary (which is certainly better today), the call for speedy legal action on such a huge aspect of fraud and corruption, involving political appointees, and those with power and influence over areas of governance, remains the issue of substance in this new phase of the Treasury Bond issue.
It revives the call for a new commitment to fight corruption by the government, which needs much more unity than is seen today in the SLFP – UNP clash in local government polls, showing all signs of turning into a more decisive difference after these polls, with SLFP members in government talking openly of alliances with the SLPP after the polls.
President Sirisena, who has scored well in his statement on the Treasury Bond Commission findings, will certainly face a very different situation in the rivalry of politics, when he settles down to consider the future of the SLFP – UNP alliance, which has formally ended, and awaits possible extension after these local polls. The Treasury Bonds will be of little help in the final issue of continued unity within the government, which will be the substance of UNP and SLFP consideration for the future.
