Ananataya Beach resort and Spa, Passikudah, celebrates first anniversary

Ananataya Beach Resort and Spa, Passikudah, owned by LAUGFS Leisure Limited, celebrated its first anniversary, last weekend.
The word ‘Anantaya’ means ‘endless’ and true to this, the resort, tucked away in a secluded East Coast location, is blessed with an unspoiled sandy beach.
Guests enjoy the beauty of a natural bay with extremely shallow crystal clear water, exotic coral reefs and a variety of colourful tropical fish together with luxury accommodation and services. The resort offers tastefully designed villas, suites and rooms equipped with modern facilities including large open sun decks and plunge pools and is a much sought-after after hotel in Pasikudah.
