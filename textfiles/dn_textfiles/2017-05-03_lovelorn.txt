Lovelorn

Sri Lanka’s national press successfully joined millions and millions of literary enthusiasts around the globe in celebrating the 401st birth and death anniversary of our great bard, playwright and the visionary William Shakespeare. His name is evergreen in our memory because of his vast oeuvre that revolutionized not only the cognitive and aesthetic faculties but also the psycho motor domain of man by taking all men and women onto the vast stage of the world.
All the world a stage;
And all the men and women merely players
It is very interesting when we just imagine that all of us are actors or actresses. We tend to forget all our worries in our diurnal journey of life, if we think that every action done by man is a role of the drama of life on this huge stage. Thus we can forget jealousy, cruelty, unkindness, hate, anger, arrogance, pride, swollen headedness and all the other human foibles by thinking they are parts of our acting, Then the world would become a better place to live in.
Witty utterances
William Shakespeare has offered the world 154 sonnets, 37 dramas and so many other writing and informal witty utterances to his credit. It is said that once our bard had visited a funeral house with his literary contemporaries. Other writers had always willing to be in the company of our great bard because every action and utterance from him had been great literature and a source of real inspiration for them to see the world from a different angle. While they had been in a friendly powwow one of the colleagues had written in a piece of paper about the deceased ‘nothing’ to mean that at last man comes to nothing and passed it to him . His quick response had been ‘no-thing’ written on the other side of the same piece of paper. Could any enthusiastic Shakespeare fan help me to trace this historically literary piece of paper? I would sell all my belongings and go to any faraway place to buy it. Such a pilgrimage is sweet. Yet, the hungry generation, as our sensuous poet John Keats termed it to refer to his adverse literary critics, branded him as an ‘upstart crow.’ They were university wits of that era. I feel still hurt. When I peruse through such lines for my literary undertakings, very poignantly tears wet my eyes. We ought to cherish every single letter of this great name to the hilt at any cost. If anyone or any charitable organization could sponsor me to make the most coveted pilgrimage to the literary Mucca , the birth place of our great genius, I would bring them great wealth to keep. In addendum, the writer wishes to express his disgust to the madding crowds who spoil the sanctity of the places of funerals by exhibiting drunken scenes. It is an index of moral decadence. They could follow our great bard and invent something useful to the society.
My concern here is quite different. My attempt during this season of Shakespeare is to explore the possibility of applying one of the most favourite lines of a sonnet to the modern world. The title of this piece of writing is an extract from the sonnet no.138 ‘when my love swears that she is made of truth’
A gist of the meaning of the said sonnet would serve me as the springboard for this discussion. At the same time it would facilitate the reader to grasp the quintessence of his writing in this context.
As the very topic or the celebrated first line implies, the speaker makes a direct statement that his lover swears that her love is truthful. That is a sort of assurance. On the part of the sonneteer it is very philosophical because it is the general utterance that women make to fall in love with.
Desires fulfilled
The modern lovers both teenagers and adults exploit this hackneyed utterance to proceed in their romantic endeavours to have their carnal desires fulfilled. It has become a very common scene throughout the length and breadth of the country in every possible nook and cranny both amateur and adult lovers and also paramours embrace and cuddle and even go serious depending on their shared arousal of romantic feelings totally disregarding the public presence. The voluptuous behaviour is witnessed and longed by the onlookers because of human nature. In almost all these scenes, it is never genuine love , but to get their carnal desires satisfied . A railway commuter could see with his or her naked eyes along the coastline, the gravity of the situation. Most of the social surveys and police raids have candidly revealed that most of these lovers are schoolgoers, office workers, paramours of all sorts, university students, rapists, high ranking officers sexually harassing the lower rankers or the hippy type tourists. They seem to swear, yet they give a good slap to the sacred emotion of love, lo and behold! Parents of these young girls and boys might be thinking that their children are learning at tutories . They end as umbrella lovers in the shades of mangroves or dingy places and thus become vulnerable to undesirable social elements.
Our bard tells us in the correct grasping of the matter,
I do believe her, though I know she lies
It is very pertinent to mention it in capital letters as it is a capital punishment to the sacred nature of love. Our bard’s profound vision is epitomized in the line. Our bard goes onto say that the women might think that the man under her grip is an uneducated man when he believes her . The opposite is correct.
That she might think me some untutor’d youth
Unlearned in the world’s subtleties
Male lover knowingly all the lies goes on. This is the naked truth at Galle Face Green or Viharamahadevi park or any other rendezvous of their choice.
The ground reality is that the women lover perfectly knows that her lover’s best youth is dead and gone. Yet, the frustrated men and women in romance are in a mad rat race of love to get their carnal arrears satisfied very quickly. Lo and behold, a vigilant observer could find very young girls on the lap of very old men , may be for money or prostitution. Any way the trend should be arrested ,otherwise the phenomenon would erupt as the recent mountain of trash. The moral stench in our paradise island would be felt even in Europe. The stink bomb of lovemaking in Sri Lanka!
Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young
although she knows my days are past the best.
Half of the family strife in the modern society is rooted in this amorous cause. The parents lock horns over their voluptuous behaviour in the very presence of their own growing children at their crucial ages of emotional development according to JEAN PIAGET, the icon of child psychology from France.
Carnal endeavours
Emerging from this devastating truth is another calamitous situation that not everyone pays attention to. In inner mind, both lovers accept that they are lying to each other. To each other they individually credit their lies. Thus they simply suppress the simple truth of lying for carnal endeavours.
