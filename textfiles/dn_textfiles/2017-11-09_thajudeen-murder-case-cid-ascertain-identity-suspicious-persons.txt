Thajudeen Murder case; CID to ascertain identity of suspicious persons

The CID yesterday informed court that they have initiated a comprehensive investigation to ascertain the identity of several suspicious persons in connection with the murder of former rugby player Wasim Thajudeen.
Filing a further report in Court, the CID informed Colombo Additional Magistrate Jayram Trotsky that it had deployed several investigative groups to examine the facts obtained from individual informants regarding the suspicious persons who involved in the incident.
The CID further informed Court that they have identified several suspicious telephone calls and sought the assistance of several government institutions including Department of Immigration and Emigration, Department of Registration of Persons and Department of Motor Traffic to ascertain their identity.
Meanwhile, acceding the prosecution’s request, the Court issued an order directing the CID’s Forensic Investigation Unit that an analytical report pertaining to the Thajudeen’s mobile phone be handed over to the CID’s Gang Robbery Investigation Unit for further investigations.
Former Western Province Senior DIG Anura Senanayake,former Narahenpita Crimes OIC Sumith Champika Perera and former Colombo Chief Medical Officer Prof.Ananda Samarasekara had been named as first,second and third suspects of this case respectively.
They were arrested over their alleged role in the cover up of evidence in the former rugby player Wasim Thajudeen murder and conspiring to commit the murder. They are currently out on bail.
However, third suspect Prof.Ananda Samarasekara was not present in Court yesterday. The Court was informed through his lawyers that Ananda Samarasekara is receiving treatment at a hospital.
While delivering the verdict, former Colombo Additional Magistrate Nishantha Peiris on February 25, 2016 ruled that the death appeared to be a murder and ordered the CID Director to immediately arrest all suspects involved in the incident and produce them before Courts.
Thajudeen was killed, apparently,in a road accident in Colombo on May 17, 2012. The CID had informed court that investigations conducted so far had revealed that Thajudeen’s teeth had been broken, the bones in the pelvic region also broken and his neck pierced with a sharp instrument prior to his death.
The CID added that muscles in his legs had been cut with a piece of a broken class. Earlier, police maintained that Thajudeen was driving to the airport and had lost control of his car and crashed into the wall of Shalika Grounds at Park Road, Narahenpita, and that his vehicle had exploded within seconds of the crash.
Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake appeared for CID. President’s Counsel Shavindra Fernando with Thisya Weragoda appeared for the third suspect.
