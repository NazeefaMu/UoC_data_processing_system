Australia, Sri Lanka sign new partnership to fight CKDu

Australia’s nuclear agency, the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO), yesterday signed an MOU with the Presidential Taskforce for Prevention of Chronic Kidney Disease to assist in the fight against chronic kidney disease of unknown aetiology (CKDu).
According to the Journal of Environmental Health and Preventative Medicine (2014), CKDu affects around 100,000 people, and is linked to 5,000 deaths every year.
It is also a serious public health problem in other countries, particularly in Central America. Despite more than 20 years of study in Sri Lanka and globally, it is not well understood.
While CKDu appears to disproportionally affect poor, rural, male farmers in hot climates, the reasons why are not yet clear.
The World Health Organisation has identified potential contributing factors, including heavy metals in the groundwater, agrochemicals, heat stress, malnutrition and low birth weight and leptospirosis.
More research on the issue is needed, said Foreign Affairs Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva, when he visited the Australian Synchrotron in March 2017.
Sri Lanka’s High Commissioner to Australia, Somasundaram Skandakumar and the CEO of ANSTO, Dr Adi Paterson signed an MOU in the presence of President Maithripala Sirisena and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
The MOU will see Australia provide new insights into the disease.
“Australia and Sri Lanka have developed a cooperative relationship over the past 70 years. The new agreement will impact on people’s lives, further strengthen Australia’s ties with Sri Lanka, and broaden Australia’s relationships in the region,” said Australian Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science, Senator Arthur Sinodinos AO.
