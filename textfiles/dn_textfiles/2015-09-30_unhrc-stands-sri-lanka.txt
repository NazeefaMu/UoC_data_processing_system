UNHRC stands by Sri Lanka

Member nations of the UNHRC that took part in its 30th session yesterday stood by the domestic inquiry mechanism proposed by the Sri Lankan government - with the support and cooperation of international stakeholders.
Despite heavy lobbying from certain sections of the Tamil diaspora, the majority of key members of the UNHRC settled for an inquiry mechanism owned by Sri Lanka, as mentioned in the resolution presented to the 30th session of the UNHRC.
The UK yesterday reiterated its commitment to supporting Sri Lanka towards achieving meaningful justice, reparation and lasting peace and stability.
Addressing the UNHRC general debate, UK stressed that "seeking truth, ensuring justice, providing reparations and ensuring non-recurrence are essential."
Welcoming Sri Lanka's Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera's commitments to reconciliation, the UK pledged to support Sri Lanka to "overcome a legacy of the past" and "fulfill its potential."
Estonia and Switzerland invited Sri Lanka to ratify the Rome Statute as a guarantee against non-recurrence.
Meanwhile, a group of Tamil politicians attending the discussion, called on the Council to push for justice for the victims of war.
Tamil National Alliance members, Suresh Premachandran, Anandi Saseetharan and M. K. Sivajilingham expressed disappointment with the efforts of the new Government in addressing accountability.
The draft resolution was tabled at the UNHRC on September 24. The resolution was co-sponsored by the USA, Sri Lanka, UK, Australia, Macedonia and Montenegro.
The resolution calls for wide-ranging reforms and a domestic accountability mechanism with international involvement.
The first resolution on Sri Lanka was adopted at the UNHRC in 2009 during a special session soon after the end of war. It was a resolution of assistance to Sri Lanka in the promotion and protection of human rights.
The report of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) Investigation on Sri Lanka was made public on September 16.
