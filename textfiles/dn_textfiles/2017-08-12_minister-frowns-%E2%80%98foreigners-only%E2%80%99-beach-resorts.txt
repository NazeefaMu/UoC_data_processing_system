Minister frowns at ‘Foreigners only’ beach resorts

Moves to remove barriers for local tourists:
Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha berated action by local entrepreneurs to reserve “Foreigners only” beach resorts.
The minister made this remark at a meeting with the top entrepreneurs of the tourism industry recently. “Various local entrepreneurs engaged in the hospitality industry in the Southern coastal area have put up “Foreigners Only” boards on their beach resorts and have ignored local tourists.
Each citizen has the right to visit any part of the country.
“No one has the authority to take away that right," the minister said.
“The local authorities will take steps to prevent such incidents in the future. Tourism is one of the biggest income earners for the country and provides a large number of jobs for the people. We should protect the industry," he said.
Minister Musthapha requested Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal de Silva to take steps to minimise difficulties experienced by local tourists in holiday resorts in the region.
He instructed the officials to initiate a programme in liaison with the tourism ministry to control the situation.
