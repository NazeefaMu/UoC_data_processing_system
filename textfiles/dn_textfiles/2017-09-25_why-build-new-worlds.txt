Why build new worlds

When J. R. R. Tolkien theorized writing fantasy literature, he called the successful fantasy author a “sub-creator”; someone who can make “a Secondary World which your mind can enter”. While you are “inside” this world, you accept as true the ways in which it has been constructed. The laws that hold this world together have to be coherent and consistent. “The moment disbelief arises”, warns Tolkien, “the spell is broken; the magic, or rather, art, has failed.”
Not all fantasy builds entire imaginary worlds. There are brilliant and powerful fantasy works that simply enchant our own world (the “Primary World”, in Tolkien’s terminology). But “high”, or “immersive” fantasy allows us to inhabit another world, an alternative world. [SUBHEAD] Dragons forever It may have elements of what we know and recognize, but it is also fundamentally different. In some of these worlds dragons exist and elves live forever and can be reincarnated. In others, language has the power to summon and transform, or children can fly with the help of fairy dust. In yet others, human beings are accompanied by an aspect of their consciousness in the form of an animal, or there is an entire parallel universe of magic, complete with a secret Ministry. In its offer of an alternate reality, fantasy has much in common with science fiction. But while science fiction worlds are more about speculation and “thought experiments”, fantasy worlds tend to focus on enchantment and the revival of mythical motifs.
To talk about fantasy worlds is to talk about imaginary space and time, carefully thought through and crafted. In The Lord of the Rings, Elrond reminisces about the Last Alliance of Elves and Men thousands of years in the past, and this is not a literary device. By the time he wrote that scene, Tolkien had been constructing his secondary world, Arda (only the north-western part of which is Middle-earth), for over two decades.
The heroes of the past that Aragorn mentions to the hobbits had already been invented by Tolkien many years before, and they were fully developed characters with elaborate stories, not names dropped to create an effect. The sense of depth of time in Tolkien’s fantasy is tangible.
Painstaking efforts
As for space, the maps of Middle-earth are not there for decoration, but are an integral part of the experience of reading Tolkien’s work. His painstaking efforts to make the geography work realistically are legend. He even respected the phases of the moon within the chronology of The Lord of the Rings, as the characters move across his invented landscape. Tolkien also devised entire timelines and genealogies that showed his world unfolding in time. And his landscapes are inhabited by flora and fauna that is inventive and significant: from the golden mallorn trees in Lothlórien, to the awe-inspiring Oliphants.
And, with this rich setting that gives you a “where” and “when”, comes culture. Or, rather, cultures. The encyclopaedic detail that accompanies many of these cultures make Tolkien’s mythology read like history, like a vast tapestry of interweaved historical narratives. That is the sort of fantasy that George R. R. Martin has also adhered to in his series A Song of Ice and Fire. The politics of Martin’s clashing cultures may have moved beyond a good-vs-evil dichotomy, but the presentation of competing ideologies and an understanding of the cultural “other” and its distinct point of view is already there in Tolkien’s writing.
For Tolkien, this massive world-building was in part a way of dealing with the many traumas of his early life (from orphanhood to the horrors of the Somme) and a way of indulging in his “secret vice”, the art of creating imaginary languages (languages, of course, need speakers to develop and flourish). For other fantasists, the motivations are different.
The creation of Ursula Le Guin’s Earthsea was, in many ways, an act of writing against Middle-earth and the medievalism of the many secondary worlds that followed it. Rather than constructing a world that feels like the landmass of Northwestern Europe in a vaguely medieval period, Le Guin gives us a Polynesia-like archipelago of islands inhabited by copper-skinned and black people, with white people considered barbarians at the fringes of the main civilization.
quest romances
She was quite conscious of her choice: “I didn’t see why everybody in heroic fantasy had to be white”, she wrote. Added to that, Earthsea is more tribal than feudal. It is a world that revolves around principles of anthropology (rites of passage, sympathetic magic and shamanism) rather than philology, epics and quest romances. It has a Taoist flavour, rather than the Christian undertones of Middle-earth or C. S. Lewis’s Narnia.
Part of the pleasure of creating fantasy worlds is fulfilling the desire to “play God”. Tolkien described “sub-creation” (a word used knowingly) as the duty of writers to imitate God’s creation of the Primary World. He captured this idea in a line of verse in his poem “Mythopoeia”: “We make still by the law in which we’re made”.
This religious (or metaphysical) motivation for world-building had already been expressed by George MacDonald, Tolkien’s Victorian predecessor and one of the “grandfathers” of Tolkienian fantasy. MacDonald claimed that the laws of nature “may suggest laws of other kinds, and man may, if he pleases, invent a little world of his own, with its own laws”. In their thinking, God was the ultimate world-builder: he created the wonder of the natural world. The fantasist follows in the same divine footsteps, but his or her worlds only exist in the imagination.
And if “playing God” is, perhaps, a rather loaded expression, then just playing is a good enough motivation in itself. Indeed, many authors of fantasy started creating worlds as part of childhood play. The phenomenon of childhood paracosms, elaborate worlds created by small groups of children, often siblings, is fascinating. The Brontë siblings created the fantastical worlds of Angria and Gondal, complete with their distinct geography, history and tales of adventure and intrigue. Boxen, the paracosm created by C. S. Lewis and his brother Warnie, included talking animals – a concept that eventually fed into Narnia.
