PM vows to increase health, education funds

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe vowed to increase the funds for health and education sectors despite the current economic hardships of the country, yesterday.
He reminded that the government led by President Maithripala Sirisena assumed power on January 8 with the pledge of developing the health and education sectors to create social justice in the country.
The Premier made these observations addressing a programme for school principals and officials at Temple Trees, to make them aware on the government’s move to distribute mobile science laboratory kits to 3,000 rural schools. The government has spent Rs. 450 million to procure the kits.
The Prime Minister, highlighting the need to gear up the country’s student population for an upcoming technology revolution, reiterated the government’s commitment to develop the science and technology education in the country. He said all students in the Advanced Level class would be given a tablet this year. “On Wednesday, in this very same hall, we marked the extension of the 1990 Suwaseriya Ambulance Service to the entire country. Today, we provide science laboratory facilities to 3,000 schools which lacked those facilities. These indicate the prominent attention the government has given to health and education sectors,” he said.
