Biker’s dare

The icy freshness of Mountain Dew turned into a hot and sweaty ‘Day of Dares 3.0’ reaching out to biking fans in Anuradhapura, Kurunegala and Gampaha. These towns reverberated to the sound of several motorbikes and was one of the biggest consumer activations undertaken by a beverage brand in Sri Lanka.
Mountain Dew, one of the fastest growing brands in the Pepsico portfolio in Sri Lanka continues to hold its brand promise of instigating fearless adventures which their consumers can experience. The campaign was even better than the previous events in terms of experiential fervor, supported by the fully committed involvement of Pepsico’s internal departments and sales teams.
The action began at strategic points at the Main Bus Stand in Anuradhapura, followed by one in Kurunegala and near the Gampaha Railway Station. These locations drew unexpected youthful enthusiasts from across the regions. Some of the leading and best stunt riders at these events gave bike enthusiasts a unique opportunity to be deeply involved in their dream of daring sports.
Commenting on the campaign, Amit Joshi, Country Head, Varun Beverages Lanka Pvt. Ltd. said, “ Day of Dares 3.0 combines our brand philosophy and passion for bike stunting in a unique blend, so there is something for everyone. Because of the resounding success of ‘Day of Dares’ 1.0 and 2.0, we organized the 3.0 event which epitomized the thrills of daring sports and raised spectator expectations to new heights.”
Dulanee Werrackody, General Manager, Marketing & Key Accounts, Varun Beverages Lanka Pvt. Ltd. stated, “Over the years Mountain Dew has been able to connect with young audiences, sharing their brand identity as an enabler of thrilling events, sponsoring and being involved with such challenging sports. The campaign synergized the brand’s daring and challenging theme of encouraging consumers to rise above fears and try something new, explore new boundaries and to emerge victorious.”
