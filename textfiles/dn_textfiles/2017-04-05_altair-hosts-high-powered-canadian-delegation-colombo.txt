Altair hosts high-powered  Canadian delegation in Colombo

 An influential parliamentary and business delegation from Canada was hosted in Colombo recently by Altair.
The delegation comprised of Members of Parliament representing Legislative Assemblies as well as the Federal Parliament of Canada and 20 Canadian businessmen, many of them of Sri Lankan origin. The Altair event at the Hilton Colombo was also graced by the members of the Canadian High Commission including officials dealing with trade, and representatives of the local banking fraternity.
“We already had strong indications of Canadian interest in the long term investment potential of Altair's apartments, consequent to a visit to Toronto late last year,” Altair Director Pradeep Moraes said. “Our interaction with the Canadian delegation in Colombo reinforced this impression and has raised our expectations further.”
Now at its 56th level on the vertical tower and the 53rd on the sloping tower, Altair will on completion comprise of a 63-storey tower which leans in to a taller, 68-storey tower. Acknowledged as a game changer in contemporary living in Sri Lanka, the Altair building has already brought a new dimension in aesthetics to Colombo's skyline.
It is intended to be a one-of-its-kind development in South Asia in terms of architectural design, structural engineering, and living experience.
Altair will offer its 400 apartments spectacular views of the Beira Lake, the Indian Ocean and the city of Colombo.
The development's 1.5 million square feet of high-end eco-friendly living space will be supported by 40,000 square feet of supportive up-market retail space.
