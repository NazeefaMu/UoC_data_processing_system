Reconciliation a must for development: Dr. Senaratne

“I advised the former president in order to turn him to another King Dharmashoka or Nelson Mandela, but he did not listen and turned into another Robert Mugabe,” Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, glorious Robert Mugabe was sacked and the army grabbed power. That was how he ended up.
But Nelson Mandela went home as a glorious man. He was addressing the gathering after handing over certificates and medals to 61 schoolchildren who got through the grade five scholarship examination in the Beruwala electorate.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that the Good Governance Government can go ahead without signing agreements with fundamentalists during its journey. Reconciliation is a must to achieve development and walk forward in the world as a developed country. Fundamentalism destroys countries.
The Dr. Rajitha Senaratne Education Centre in Darga Town organized the presentation of scholarships and medals for the third time. Minister Dr. Senaratne donated Rs. 300,000 to the Muslim Balika Vidyalaya.
He also donated funds to the Pragnarama Temple in Ambagaha Handiya. State Pharmaceutical Corporation (SPC) Managing Director Dr. Rumi Mohammad and his family donated stationery to 750 schoolchildren.
