“Based on these criteria it has been decided to establish three new local authorities as Ambagamuwa, Maskeliya and Norwood Pradeshiya Sabha instead of current Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha and to establish three new local authorities as Nuwara Eliya, Agarapathana and Kotagala Pradeshiya Sabhas instead of existing Nuwara Eliya Pradeshiya Sabha.” He said.
Establishment of all local authorities, including the above local authorities ,will be gazetted on November 1. The above information presented by Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Mustapha was considered by the Cabinet of ministers, he said.
Responding to a query by a journalist, Minister Rajitha Senaratne said that both UNP and SLFP organizers for Beruwala have already showed their willingness to contest under one symbol at the upcoming Local Government Election and the final decision with regard to this will be taken after discussing with them further.
According to UNP sources, both, UNP and SLFP groups, in some Pradeshiya Sabhas and Municipal Councils have also expressed their willingness to contest under a common symbol. “There is no special purpose behind this and we only want to show the unity between two parties.” Minister Senaratne said
