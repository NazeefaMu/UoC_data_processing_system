Amana Bank opens first self banking centre at Slave Island

Amãna Bank inaugurated its first Self Banking Centre at Slave Island under the patronage of Chief Executive Officer Mohamed Azmeer alongside the Bank’s Director Jazri Magdon Ismail and members of the Management Committee.
The Self Banking Centre, which is one of many to be launched, currently houses a Cash Deposit Machine and a Cheque Deposit Boxto facilitate 24x7 transactions for customers.
Commenting on the Bank’s initiative to introduce Self Banking Centres, Chief Executive Officer Mohamed Azmeer stated “While customer’s have 24x7 access to over 4000 ATMs through the LankaPay network for withdrawals, their access to deposits was limited to only standard banking hours at our branches. With the introduction of our Self Banking Centre, customers now have the convenience of making deposits round the clock.
We intend to expand this initiative to many more regions, thereby providing greater reach and access to our valued customers.”
The Slave Island Self Banking Centre is centrally located at Justice Akbar Mawatha, Colombo 2.
The Bank was recognized as the Best ‘Up-and-Comer’ Islamic Bank of the World by ‘Global Finance Magazine’ at the 18th Annual World’s Best Banks Award Ceremony held in Washington DC, USA. The Bank was also bestowed the coveted title ‘Islamic Finance Entity of the Year’ at the inaugural Islamic Finance Forum of South Asia Awards Ceremony.
Amãna Bank PLC is a stand-alone institution licensed by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange with Jeddah based IDB Group being the principal shareholder having a 29.97% stake of the Bank.
