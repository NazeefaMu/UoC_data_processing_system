Living in the Line

Juliet Coombe enjoys a traditional home stay and village cooking class in the tea country and learns why nothing beats a plot to plate cooking experience.
The Line tea experience is not easy as it is as ‘off the grid’ as you can get in a place that has no internet, iPads or any other modern distractions. I quickly discover, walking from one hand cut path to another requires skill and observation, the charms of line village living, in a hidden valley of vibrant green tea slopes and the occasional coffee patch is a rustic experience that calms the mind and clears the soul.
Here is a land of a million smiles and passionate tea pickers, smiling as I pass by with their golden teeth glinting in the sunlight life is simple and rich in old fashioned traditions. Meena Amma will meet you, with a bindi spot painted on your forehead, and welcome drink in her open air mud kitchen. Her laugh is infectious, as is her sizzling traditional cooking class that I decide to join in her lovely Line home. We are welcomed in with Ayubowan, ‘may you be blessed with a long life’, and then roll up my sleeves and wash my hands. I learn step by step how to make pol sambal, chicken curry and then join the village kids on the escarpment to catch the new born baby chicks and take them up the hill to where their mother hen is happily pecking away, and probably secretly glad to get away from her naughty six fluff ball baby chicks and the naughty village kids who want to play with them.
Back in the kitchen we build a wood fire to cook on, and I help cut up vegetables, this time side ways to maximise the amount of spice that will be absorbed, and also get to blow through a blowpipe to fan the log fire cooking my first dish village style rich in gravy chicken curry and then needle the dough over and over again to get plenty of air into it so it will rise. I am told by Meena, who sprinkles coconut oil onto the dough to soften it for cooking, that this has been done the same way for hundreds of years and always, until more recently, made inside one of Sri Lanka’s iconic clay pots. All this is watched through a simple wooden line house open window in a hidden mountain valley, where community remains king and perhaps, I ponder as I make my first flat bread roti this is the reason for the happiness I feel everywhere I walk.

I learn a great deal about village life from the grandparents who stay at home to look after the kids, while their parents work on the escarpment. We share, tea, stories and cut up a cake to share with the rest of the village. Taking plates piled high with chocolate cakes along the line of houses gives me the perfect excuse to introduce myself to the other families who tell me stories about witchcraft and how to make games out of rope pulling and ‘who can break the water pot with a stick, first’. Returning to my home stay I watch the neighbours splattering their kids with herbal oil as a healthy hair treatment and find the older members of the community are taking them to the Tamil shrine to make an offering afterwards. The air is filled with incense as they light joss sticks and they return to eat some of the lovely food Meena and I have prepared for them in their absence. She is delighted to tell me stories about her life as a tea picker and placing rice and curry, a village meal out on a cut out banana leaf, she tells me it is because it contains enzymes that are good for our digestive systems. For me she has made a special recipe of rosemary tea boiled for three minutes. They say a cup of rosemary when you meet a new friend will cement the friendship for a lifetime, as it is great for your long-term memory. I learn it is how you knew a witch in medieval times and I make jokes by waving curry leaves over Meena’s head.
As the weather turns from sunny to thundery grey it is time to finish the delicious meal and go to bed in the lovely two rooms at the back of Meen’s line house. Here one can hear the orchestra of insects and passing birds as one settles into a deep sleep. Somehow the pure mountain air clears the head and makes one feel like sleeping forever. However the village cockerel has other ideas and at crack of dawn I am up with the rest of the village pulling my weight in the home garden, laughing and playing with the kids and exchanging stories about the good old days. Luckily here slow cooking remains king and community is what matters.
