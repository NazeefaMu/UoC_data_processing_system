Holi boosts domestic holiday demand in India

Ahead of the Holi weekend, online tour operators reported a spike in demand for domestic holidays, as well as international short-haul destinations. Destinations with visa-on-arrival facilities such as Thailand, Bali, Mauritius, and Sri Lanka are especially in demand this season, travel agents said.
We have seen a steady increase in travel bookings during the weekend. It has become the norm in Hyderabad and across the country. Travellers are looking at these weekends as an opportunity to indulge in short getaways,” said Yatra B2C Chief Operating Officer Sharat Dhall. “The affordable airfares, no visa hassles, and budget stay options have made these destinations more appealing. We have observed an increase in demand for domestic holidays, as well as international short-haul destinations,” said SOTC Travel India and NRI Markets Sales Head Daniel D'souza.
Indian travellers are also heading to one of the largest Holi celebrations slated to be held at the Sri Sri Radha Krishna Temple at Spanish Fork, Utah, in the US, organised by the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON). It is planned to be held on March 24 and 25.
“Indian travellers have capitalised this opportunity by clubbing it with the next long weekend that falls between March 30 and April 2, thereby extending their vacation,” said FCM Travel Solutions Leisure Businesses Executive Director Shravan Gupta. (Times of India)
