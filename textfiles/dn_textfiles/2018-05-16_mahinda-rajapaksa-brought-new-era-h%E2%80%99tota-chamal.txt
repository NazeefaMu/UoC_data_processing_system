Mahinda Rajapaksa brought a new era to H’tota - Chamal

The Hambantota port and Mattala airport are catalysts of development. Those who direct criticism against them do so due to ignorance, said former speaker Chamal Rajapaksa addressing the gathering at the Hambantota Urban Council.
The meeting was held to welcome the newly elected Mayor Eraj Ravindra Fernando and the members elected to the Hambantota Urban Council.
Rajapaksa said that the far-sighted policies of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa brought a new era and a period of transition to the Hambantota district, which had been a backward district for decades. He said that Hambantota is a multicultural and multiracial city where people live in harmony. When tsunami caused destruction to Hambantota in 2004, everybody was treated equally without taking into consideration caste, creed or race.
The first-ever dry zone botanical garden, the first-ever safari park, the international convention hall and the administration complex were set up under the greater Hambantota concept. The mega development projects inaugurated bythe previous regime have come to a standstill. As a result, those who engaged themselves in these projects now remain jobless and find it impossible to keep their home fires burning.
