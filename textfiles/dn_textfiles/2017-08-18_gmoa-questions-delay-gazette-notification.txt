GMOA questions delay on gazette notification

The Health Minister has broken his own promise by not issuing the gazette notification on minimum standards of medical education within a period of two weeks which ended last Monday (14th), the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) Acting Media Spokesman Dr. Prasad Kolambage said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the Health Minister promised to issue the gazette notification on minimum standards of medical education on or before August 14th (last Monday) but failed to do so. Now he should reveal to the country all about this gazette notification and its current situation.
According to Dr, Kolambage, the Health Minister is speechless when the media questions him about the gazette notification and the so called `agreement’ signed with Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital in connection with its `taking over’. He ran away whenever the media questioned him about those issues. But, earlier he always had answers to anything.
The GMOA has already made a complaint to the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption in connection with the alleged financial fraud and misuse of public property that had taken place in connection with the taking over of Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital. The GMOA is hopeful that the commission will conduct an investigation on the issue. The GMOA will not hesitate to take stern action if the Government fails to address the SAITM issue and other connected issues, he added.
