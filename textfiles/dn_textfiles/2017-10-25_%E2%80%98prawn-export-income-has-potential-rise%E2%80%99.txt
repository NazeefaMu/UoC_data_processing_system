‘Prawn export income has potential to rise’

The present USD 17.5 million income from prawn exports has the potential to rise to USD 140 million, said Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage.
Prawn farmers should pay close attention to follow the proper methods to increase their harvest and achieve that target, he said.
The minister was speaking at a meeting with prawn farmers following an inspection tour of Ambakandawila in Chilaw on October 21. He said his ministry would provide them with the required technical expertise and other assistance.
