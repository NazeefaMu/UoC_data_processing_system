Samsung Electronics posts record quarterly earnings in Q3 on solid chip demand

SEOUL - Samsung Electronics, South Korea’s tech giant, posted its record-quarterly-high earnings in the third quarter thanks mainly to solid demand for memory chips, the company said.
Samsung’s operating profit reached a new high of 17.6 trillion won ($15.4 billion) in the July-September quarter, up 20.9 percent from a year earlier.
It surpassed the previous high of 15.6 trillion won tallied in the first quarter of this year.
Revenue gained 5.5 percent over the year to 65.5 trillion won in the quarter. It was slightly lower than the record high of 66 trillion won logged in the fourth quarter of last year.
The ratio of operating profit to revenue, which gauges profitability, was 26.8 percent in the September quarter.
The high profitability was attributed to brisk sales of memory chips. Samsung’s chipmaking unit posted 13.7 trillion won of operating profit on revenue of 24.8 trillion won.
Both the operating profit and the revenue of the chipmaking division were the highest readings in Samsung’s history. The division’s ratio of operating profit to revenue surged to 55.1 percent in the quarter.
Despite the strong chip sales, concerns remained about the excessive dependence on the chipmaking business in making profit. The chip division’s operating profit accounted for 77.7 percent of the total in the third quarter. Global prices for memory chips turned downward recently, casting a shadow on Samsung’s fourth-quarter earnings.
Samsung also forecast its fourth-quarter earnings would decline on a quarterly basis on the slowdown in the global chip industry.
Uncertainties lingered over trade conflict among major economies, which could weaken global trade and negatively affect the exporters of South Korea, including Samsung.
