Ex-ministers to support Govt’s good deeds

Most Ven.Tibbotuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Mahanayake thera of the Malwatte Chapter said he believed that the 16 SLFP members who held Ministerial posts would remain in the government for the full length of its tenure.
The Prelate expressed these sentiments when the group of 16 SLFP members who resigned from government ranks called on him at his temple in Kandy to receive his blessings.
The SLFP members said that eventhough they would sit in the Opposition, they would support all good deeds of the government.
The Mahanayake said the UNP and the SLFP were two diametrically opposed parties and as such it was natural for problems to crop up when they served in a unity government.
SLFP Treasurer MP S. B.Dissanayake said they will remain with the President and the SLFP and try to prod the government on the correct track. Although they would sit in the opposition from May 8 they would strive to strengthen the SLFP and the UPFA under the chairmanship of President Maithripala Sirisena.
SLFP senior Vice President John Seneviratne said they held ministry posts in the unity government with the firm intention of doing some service to the country.
But unfortunate they could not bring about the change they expected. The country had fallen into dire straits in the economic, cultural and social officers during the immediate past and as such the SLFP would not be able to face the public if it continued to remain as a partner in the government.
Former ministers Anura Priyadarshana Yapa,Susil Premajayantha, Dayasiri Jayasekara, Lakshman Yapa Abeywardane, Chandima Weerakkody and former Deputy Ministers Sumedha Jayasena, Dilan Perera, T. B. Ekanayake, Anuradha Jayaratne, Susantha Punchinilame, Lakshman Wasantha Perera and former Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala were present.
