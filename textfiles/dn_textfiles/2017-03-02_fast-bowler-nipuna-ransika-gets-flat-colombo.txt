Fast bowler Nipuna Ransika gets a flat in Colombo

Sri Lanka's emerging under-19 fast bowler Nipuna Ransika from Ambalangoda P. de S. Kularatna Vidyalaya who excelled on the under 19 tours to South Africa and England was presented a flat at the 'Sayurupura' housing scheme in Angulana by Housing and Construction Minister Sajth Pramadasa.
Seventeen-year-old Ransika who has recorded bowling speeds of 140 kmph is training under former Sri Lanka fast bowler Chaminda Vaas at Sri Lanka Cricket. He has to travel from Ambalangoda to Colombo for practices regularly and financially he found it difficult.
Ransika's family lives in a small house in Polwatta and the house has been mortgaged. Minister Premadasa instructed National Housing Development Authority Chairman S. Palansooriya to construct a new house for Nipuna's family and assured to grant Rs. 500,000 to get the mortgage released.
The Minister said that Nipuna can stay in Colombo and focus on his practices and make the country proud by becoming a great bowler of international fame in the future.
Minister Premadasa handed over the deed and the key of Nipuna's Angula flat at the ministry auditorium in Battaramulla on February 21 in the presence of Nipuna's family members, MP Bandula Lal Bandarigoda, Ministry Secretary W.K.K. Athukorala, NHDA Chairman Lakvijaya S. Palansooriya and Urban Settlement Development Authority Chairman Ranjith Shantha Kahawala.
