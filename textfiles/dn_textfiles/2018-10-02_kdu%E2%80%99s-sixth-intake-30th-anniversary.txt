KDU’s sixth intake 30th anniversary

To mark the 30th anniversary of the sixth intake of the Kotelawala Defence University (KDU) which falls on October 5, a felicitation ceremony would be held for its members who had sacrificed their lives for the country, as well as for those who are still in service, retired or disabled.
A batch of 116 youths joined the KDU, Sri Lanka’s first Defence Academy, on October 5, 1988. As dynamic young minds, they joined the armed forces to safeguard their motherland. It was the beginning of long and respectable profession; a process that transformed civilians to military personnel.
“We had just felt the smell of gunpowder during the war when most of our batch mates were sent to the battlefronts in the North and the East at the height of terrorism in the country. Leading the armed forces as young officers and brave platoon commanders was the need of the county at that critical juncture. As commissioned officers, they were present in the battlefront as infantrymen, on gun boats and warships and on board military aircrafts,” Anniversary Celebrations Steering Committee Secretary Colonel Laksiri Perera said.
“We take this opportunity to once again salute late Prime Minister and KDU Founder Sir John Kotelawala, our alma mater, the present and past commanders of the Tri-forces, military and academic staff, instructors, as well as our parents, for making us brave sons who could significantly contribute to protect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of our motherland,” the colonel added.
“This year, the alumnai of the KDU's sixth intake, along with their families, will pay tribute to our loving batch mates for their supreme sacrifice. The valour and courage they displayed in the battlefield will be remembered forever. We will not forget the spirit-de-corps and wonderful memories created. The precious time you devoted for the motherland, the loyalty and faith towards the country, is supreme,” Anniversary Celebrations Steering Committee Chairman retired Major Mahinda Adikari said.
“There were 116 members in our batch, and it is known to be the largest ever intake in the history of the KDU. It is disheartening that 12 batch mates left us laying their precious lives in the name of Sri Lanka. Another two passed away due to tragic circumstances. The families of war heroes, serving and retired, batch mates, friends, and well-wishers, will take part in a religious ceremony at the Gangarama Temple, Colombo. A commemoration ceremony will also be held to pay military tribute to fallen heroes at the War Memorial at the Parliament complex in Sri Jayawardenepura on October 4,” Adikari added.
