Subsidiary crop cultivation promoted in Ampara

The Ampara district Agriculture Department has taken steps to enhance agricultural crops in the district. Paddy, green gram, maize, crown nut, kurakkan, cowpea and other supplementary food crops have been accorded priority under the programme. Farmers are encouraged to grow more subsidiary crops. Harvesting of green nuts started in the Thirukkovil Divisional Secretariat Division recently.
Highland cultivators are getting a good income from the produce.
