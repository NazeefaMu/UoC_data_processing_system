Kerawalapitiya plant construction; FR petition re-fixed for support

A Fundamental Rights petition which sought an Interim Order directing the authorities to stay further proceedings in respect of the tender for the construction of 300 MW HFO/NG fired power plant at Kerawalapitiya was yesterday re-fixed for support on October 23 by the Supreme Court.
The matter was re-fixed for support since the Supreme Court’s bench was not properly constituted.
H.W. Ranjith Pushpa Kumara, the Charman of National Movement for Consumer Rights Protection in Sri Lanka filed this petition pertaining to the tender for the construction of 300MW HFO/NG fired power plant at Kerawalapitiya on Build-Own-Operate-Transfer (BOOT) basis.
The petitioner cited 82 parties including GCL Intelligent Energy (Suzhou) Co., Ltd, Windforce (Pvt) Ltd, Renewgen (Pvt) Ltd, Secretary to the Ministry of Power and Energy Dr. B.M.S. Batagoda, Minister of Power and Energy Ranjith Siyambalapitiya and Cabinet of Ministers as respondents.
The petitioner stated that the petitioner and the citizens of the republic would suffer grave and irreparable loss if the Secretary to Ministry of Power and Energy and Cabinet of Ministers are permitted to take further steps to issue a letter of intent and agreements in respect of construction of 300MW HFO/NG fired power plant at Kerawalapitiya.
This petition was filed through Counsel Sanath Wijewardena. President’s Counsel Ali Sabry appeared for the petitioner. Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunatilleka appeared for the Attorney General.
