Wiggie restrained from expelling Denishwaran

The Court of Appeal yesterday issued an Interim Order preventing the decision of Northern Province Chief Minister C.V.Wigneswaran to expel B. Denishwaran from functioning as the Fisheries and Transport Minister in the province.
The petitioner B. Denishwaran had challenged Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran in the Court of Appeal, complaining that the Chief Minister had no power to appoint or remove any Provincial Council minister. The petitioner cited Chief Minister Wigneswaran, K.Sarveswaran, Ananthi Sasitharan, G. Gunaseelan, K.Sivanesan and P. Sathyalingam as well as Governor Reginald Cooray as respondents.
The petitioner claims he was one of the members of the Northern Province Board of Ministers. He states that in October 2016, a dispute arose with respect to the conduct of ministers, following which the Chief Minister appointed an inquiry panel.
