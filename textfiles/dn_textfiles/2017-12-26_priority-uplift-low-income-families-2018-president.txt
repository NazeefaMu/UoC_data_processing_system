Priority to uplift low-income families in 2018: President

President Maithripala Sirisena said in the year 2018, priority should be given to projects which focus on uplifting the economic standard of low-income families.
The President said enhancing livelihood opportunities for underprivileged people should be given priority.
He made these remarks while participating in the progress review meeting of the ‘Pibidemu Polonnaruwa’ (Awakening of Polonnaruwa) District Development Programme held at the Polonnaruwa District Secretariat, recently.
President Sirisena added that during the last three years, the Government has given priority for development projects which support and uplift the economic standard of low-income families, rather than mega development projects.
The President also stressed the need to have proper financial discipline and management when planning development projects and added that it was the responsibility of officials to minimize wastage and utilize funds in a manner which ensures maximum benefits to the public.
During this meeting, the President inquired from officials about information he received regarding several development projects carried out by wasting public funds and highlighted the need of officials to pay more attention to take appropriate action in a suitable way when planning development projects.
The President also instructed officials to look into the needs of rural people, not only concerning the development of public places including schools hospitals and temples in the city and both sides of the road. He also informed the District Secretaries to implement a special programme in this regard.
Already, 50 percent of the work of the project has been completed and it was discussed in detail regarding successful implementation of the project next year with the experiences of previous years.
Expressing his views regarding this project, the President said this project will enable the Polonnaruwa district to be named as a fully developed district during the period of 2018-2019.
It was discussed in detail regarding programmes implemented to develop the schools in the district and the President requested to give priority to rural schools development in 2018. The President also pointed out the importance of giving priority to programmes implemented for the development of agriculture as well as livestock development as the year 2018 is declared as the National Food Production Year. He also inquired officials regarding plans for the New Year in the field of livestock.
The President emphasized the importance of strengthening the local dairy industry and paid his attention regarding providing facilities in this regard.
Discussions were also held on the progress of the projects being carried out for the development of the regional hospitals in the district, drinking water supply projects, infrastructure development including road development, irrigation development, conservation of archaeological sites, the development of religious places and regarding all projects including the sports.
