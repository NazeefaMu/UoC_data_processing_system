A great relief

All right thinking Sri Lankans will heave a sigh of relief that Judge Manickavasagar Illancheliyan escaped an assassination bid on Saturday night in Jaffna after an unidentified man snatched the revolver of one of his personal protection officers and opened fire. His personal protection officer, who was critically injured in the line of duty in the shooting incident in Nallur died yesterday at the Jaffna Hospital.
Judge Illancheliyan is widely known as a fearless judge and has presided in many high profile cases. Currently the most high profile case handled by him, as part of a three-judge Trial-at-Bar is the rape and murder case of Sivaloganathan Vithya, a young Jaffna student in May 2015. This is the first time that a Trial-at-Bar is being conducted in Jaffna, which saw much unrest after the case came to light.
In a rather curious and even sinister turn of events, the abortive shooting comes just days after the arrest of former Central Province DIG Lalith Jayasinghe in connection with the above case. Jayasinghe, who was SSP Jaffna when the incident took place in May 2015, is believed to have helped one of the main suspects to flee the country. The Trial-at-Bar is continuing in the meantime, with the next hearing coming up tomorrow. Two suspects had been arrested by the Police in connection with the shooting incident. Although according to the Police, initial investigations had revealed that the shooting has not been pre-planned, all aspects of the incident must be investigated thoroughly before coming to a firm conclusion.
There is another dimension of the incident that many have not thought of. July 23 marked the 34th anniversary of the July 1983 communal riots that eventually led to a protracted conflict. While Sri Lanka has indeed moved beyond these dark days and the conflict itself, there are individuals in both the North and the South whose only salvation is ethnic disharmony and strife. They will leave no stone unturned to inflame ethnic passions and gain political mileage. They usually exploit this type of incident to whip up communal feelings among the public to further their political ambitions. The Government must keep an eye on these individuals and protect law and order in the North and elsewhere at all costs, especially at a time when concrete moves are being made to ensure reconciliation and lasting peace. A few racist politicians must not be allowed to sabotage the process of reconciliation.
The Government must enhance overall security in the peninsula in the wake of this incdent, at least until the Vithya case comes to an end. Additional protection must be provided to all three judges hearing this case and also to the court and courtroom where it is heard. Any witnesses coming forward to give evidence against the nine suspects too must be similarly protected under the terms of the nascent Witness Protection laws. In the meantime, the authorities must make sure that any attempts being made to impart an ethnic dimension to the incident are nipped in the bud. The authorities acted swiftly when a youth in a sand truck was gunned down by Police in Jaffna and the same safeguards should be applied in this case too.
This is not the first time that judges have been attacked by gunmen. High Court Judge Sarath Ambepitiya was fatally shot by assassins on November 20, 2004 on the orders of a drug lord whose case he was hearing. In fact, this brutal murder of a judge led to the very establishment of the Judicial Security Division (JSD) of the Police in 2005. Quick thinking by the JSD officers assigned to protect Judge Illancheliyan helped save his life. In the light of this incident, the JSD must be given additional training and facilities and expanded if possible. There have been many other attacks on individual judges and the judiciary itself over the years.
Restoring the independence of the Judiciary was one of the main planks of the electoral campaigns of the National Unity Government, which marks two years next month. The previous Government laughed in the face of the Judiciary, culminating with the infamous overnight impeachment of the then Chief Justice Dr Shiranee Bandaranayake. Her only fault was giving a verdict that directly contradicted the wishes of powerful figures of that Government.
True to its word, the present Government has ensured that the judiciary can function fearlessly and independently. There have been several verdicts against the Government which it accepted gracefully. If there are reservations about a verdict, that too can be addressed via the court system. However, the freedom of judiciary alone is often not enough – the Police too must be able to act fearlessly and impartially in gathering evidence for court cases. Again, this Government has strived hard to ensure the independence of the Police at all times. In high-profile cases such as Vithya’s, it is vital to ensure that the Judiciary, the Attorney General’s Department, Police and any other allied public entities can act independently without any fear or favour. Then only can true justice be dispensed effectively.
