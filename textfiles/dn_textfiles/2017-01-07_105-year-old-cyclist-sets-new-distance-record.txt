105-year-old cyclist sets new distance record

He might be 105 years old but there's just no stopping Frenchman Robert Marchand in his pursuit of new cycling records.
The centenarian cyclist, who became vegetarian a month ago, pedaled 22.547 kilometers (14 miles) in 60 minutes at the Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines velodrome outside Paris Wednesday. His distance fell short of the 26.927 kilometers (16.73 miles) he managed in 2014, but is still a new record in the 105-and-above category.
“I didn't see the sign for the last 10 minutes, otherwise I could have gone faster,” Marchand told BFMTV.
Britain's Sir Bradley Wiggins holds the outright mile record with a distance of 54.526km (33.88 miles).
Marchand, who was persuaded by doctors to take up meat again for the challenge, is 1.50 meters tall and weighs just 50 kilograms but makes up for his slight frame with exceptional physiology.
“He is very small but his heart is very big,” Professor Veronique Billat, who is a physiologist, told CNN Sport.
“His V02 max oxygen consumption is the same as a man of half his age who doesn't do any sports,” added Billat, referring to the measure of oxygen uptake.
“So he has a great oxygen consumption thanks to an exceptional heart.”
Marchand lives alone in his Parisian studio flat but is sustained by “optimism” as well as “laughter” and “many friends,” according to Billat, whose team has been studying the cyclist's efforts since he turned 100.
He was born in 1911 and was a keen cyclist until the age of 22 when his coach told him he would not become a champion because of his size.
