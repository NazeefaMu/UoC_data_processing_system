Fishermen to get kerosene oil subsidy from May 18

Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development and Rural Economic Affairs Minister Vijith Wijayamuny Zoysa yesterday said the fishermen using outboard motorboats (MTRB) and out-board engine fiberglass reinforced boats (OFRP) will get kerosene oil subsidy by the government from May 18.
The Minister was addressing a media conference yesterday at the Rural Affairs Ministry. He said a Cabinet paper seeking the approval for diesel subsidy for one-day and multi–day fishing boats would be presented to the Cabinet this week.
He said the government has to spend Rs. 5 billion on providing kerosene and diesel subsidy for fishermen. The government spends Rs. 349 million on the subsidy for the fishermen using the MTRB and another 3,368 million for the subsidy for the OFRP, the Minister said.
The Minister said the fishermen engaging in protests asking to reduce oil prices attempt to fulfill NGOs’ goals or other political movements’.
