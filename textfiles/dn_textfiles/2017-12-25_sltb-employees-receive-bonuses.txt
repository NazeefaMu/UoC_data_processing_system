SLTB employees to receive bonuses

The Transport Ministry has made arrangements for bonus payments for about 30,000 Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) employees, this year.
Accordingly, they would be paid a bonus payment of Rs. 5,000 each, and this is implemented with the approval of Treasury. The SLTB has already shown a progress in its operations than past years and hence, this bonus payments to its employees could be granted.
All arrears to its employees too would be paid in due course. These employees would be paid their due gratuity payments on their retirement in the future as well,” said Kurunegala District UNP Parliamentarian and Transport Deputy Minister Ashok Abeysinghe, when he was contacted by the Daily News yesterday, in Kurunegala.
