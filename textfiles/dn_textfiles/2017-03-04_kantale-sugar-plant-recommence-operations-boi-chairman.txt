Kantale sugar plant to recommence operations: BOI Chairman

The Kantale sugar plant will recommence operations after a lapse of 24 years under a foreign investment, Board of Investment (BOI) Chairman Upul Jayasuriya said.
He said that the Kantale sugar factory had not been operating for over 24 years and therefore no production is made. This situation brings immense hardships to over 20,000 farming families, which cultivate sugar canes for the factory for years.
“Then the BOI took measures to recommence the factory with an investment of a foreign investor. Under this project, which will be carried out as a private-public partnership, the British investor will invest US $ 100 million (Rs 150 billion) to the project. The investor has planned to introduce high-breed sugar cane variety, which produces a high yield to the sugar cane cultivators of the area with a technical assistance of an Indian company,” Jayasuriya said.
The Chairman was addressing the media yesterday at the BOI office in Colombo.
He added that over 90 per cent of machineries and most of the buildings of the Kantale sugar factory are in a dilapidated condition and not in working order.
He said that the initial MoU regarding the investment was signed between the investor and the BOI and the secondary MoU was signed between the investor and the Treasury. Under these agreements, the government will have 51 per cent of shares while the investor will have 49 per cent of shares of the total project.
“This is a real feasibility investment for the government, as the government will receive 51 per cent of shares free without making a monetary investment. It is significant that the ownership of the entire factory will be with the government after 30 years from the commencement of the project,” the BOI Chairman said.
“The BOI Chairmen noted that this proposal is a country-friendly project, through with both the country and the sugarcane cultivators will be benefited simultaneously. The farmers will be given a new verity of sugar cane plants which gives a better yield than the existing one,”he added.
