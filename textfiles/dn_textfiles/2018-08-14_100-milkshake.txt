$100 milkshake

A New York restaurant’s $100 milkshake has been recognized as the world’s most expensive by Guinness World Records.
The record-keeping organization announced Serendipity 3’s LUXE Milkshake, available for order in time for Wednesday’s National Vanilla Milkshake Day, contains a number of specialty ingredients and comes in a glass adorned with more than 3,000 Swarovski crystals.
The glass was designed by “Crystal Ninja” Kellie DeFries while its contents were created by chef Joe Calderone.
The milkshake contains Jersey milk sources from Channel Islands cows, Tahitian vanilla ice cream, Devonshire luxury clotted cream, Madagascar vanilla beans, 23 karat edible gold, donkey caramel sauce featuring donkey’s milk and Venezuelan cocoa, Luxardo Gourmet Maraschino Cherries and whipped cream.
“I am thrilled to add this accomplishment to our growing list of record-breaking food items,” Calderone said. “It was exciting to develop such a unique recipe and I hope our customers enjoy every drop of this creamy, rich milkshake.”
Serendipity 3 also holds Guinness records for most expensive sandwich and most expensive dessert.
