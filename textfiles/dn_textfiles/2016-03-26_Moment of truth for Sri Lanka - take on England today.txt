Moment of truth for Sri Lanka - take on England today

DELHI: Defending World T20 champs face their moment of truth as they take on England in a Group 1 match at the Feroz Shah Kotla ground here on Saturday which is crucial for their survival for the rest of the tournament.
Sri Lanka has one win and one loss from two games and they will need to win against England as well as South Africa on Monday at the same venue to qualify for the knockout stage. Failure to beat England could mean an exit from the tournament regardless of the final group game against South Africa.
Sri Lanka had six days off to recuperate and tighten up their game for their remaining two encounters.
"We had a good break. Two of those days were total rest - without training.
It was for them to concentrate on their own games to watch videos of them batting as well as bowling, and to analyse where they went wrong," said Dinesh Chandimal at the post-match press conference.
"In those days we also made a lot of plans about how to challenge England.

There will be a few small changes. Those changes will also be made to surprise them. We have a game plan and we have something up our sleeves.
The thing is we have to execute it in the middle. We are hopeful we can give them a good game."
Sri Lanka's prime concern has been their middle order batting which has let them down on several occasions. The void left by the retirements of Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara is certainly proving to be causing a big headache for Sri Lanka in their batting line up.
Those sentiments were expressed clearly by Chandimal when he said, "We are concerned about our middle order we are struggling. It can happen when you come to big games like this. We don't have experienced guys in the middle.
The guys are really working hard at practices if our middle order clicks together, we'll have a good chance.
"We can't always keep on saying every time that it's our transition period.
We've got some experienced guys as well as youngsters. We have to put our hands up and put our performance for the side. We will give it our best shot in the next two games."
The way the Delhi pitch behaved three days ago where the Afghanistan spinners had the England batsmen in all sorts of trouble, has given Sri Lanka some hope ahead of today's contest.
"England played their first two games at the Wankhede (Mumbai) and we all know that's one of the best pitches India has got. Here it's totally different. The wickets are slow. I think that'll really help us. But we'll have to play well," said Chandimal.
They key to Sri Lanka in the bowling is experienced spinner Rangana Herath but for him to win the match for his team the batting unit will need to put enough runs on the board, which they have not done so far in the
tournament, and has been their Achilles heel.
"We all know Rangana is a world class bowler. He can cause damage in the next two games against England and South Africa who usually struggle against spin," said Chandimal.
"We've also got (Jeffrey) Vandersay who is a surprise package, and Sachithra (Senanayake). If they do their best we have a good chance. We all expect a lot from Rangana, he knows how to handle those pressure situations. I think he will have a huge role to play in the next two games."
Assessing the England team, Chandimal said, "Compared to the past five or six years when they weren't concerned about the T20 format, now they are thinking. They've got some good players like (Joe) Root and (Jos) Buttler - they are the key. They are playing really well. We never underestimate any team. We'll have to play our brand of cricket."
Chandimal said that he would prefer chasing a total in the T20 format rather than setting up one." In T20 formats it's always better to chase.
When you're batting first you don't have a target in your mind, but you do when you're chasing. You can assess the first six overs how you need to bat. Chasing is an advantage as far as I'm concerned."
