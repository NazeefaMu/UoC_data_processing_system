The National Trust unveils ground-breaking book with Aitken Spence Printing support

The National Trust Sri Lanka selected Aitken Spence Printing as the sole print solution partner to produce a coffee table book that is a great value addition to the architectural knowledge in Sri Lanka.
Aitken Spence Printing is known for its high-quality standards and state-of-the-art technology in carrying out responsible printing and packaging services.
Aitken Spence Printing being a pioneer in the printing industry of Sri Lanka formed a partnership with The National Trust Sri Lanka that is dedicated to protecting and raising public awareness about Sri Lanka’s rich heritage.
Together with The National Trust Sri Lanka, Aitken Spence Printing took the lead in sponsoring a coffee table book titled ‘Geoffrey Manning Bawa: Decolonizing Architecture, by Shanti Jayewardene’, an important contribution to recognising Sri Lankan Artists.
“Aitken Spence Printing is proud to have been the sole sponsor of The National Trust’s book on Geoffrey Bawa, as it is a landmark publication that promotes Sri Lankan heritage on a cultural and aesthetic realm. Aitken Spence believes that the book is a task of national importance that would showcase a rich aspect of Sri Lanka’s wide heritage”, said Prasanna Karunathilake, Managing Director of Aitken Spence Printing.
We want the new generation of architecture students to know Bawa’s significant creations, as narrated by Dr. Shanti Jayawardene. This is the only book that carries multiple architectural view images of his creations. We also contribute to this community of architect students by printing the quarterly magazine “The Architect” and “Wasthu” among the other relevant publications for this field of study”, Karunathilake added. The publication centres around the work of Geoffrey M. Bawa (1919-2003), that is acclaimed internationally for its relationship with the traditions of Sri Lanka’s architecture.
Bawa’s work reveals him discovering the traditions of Sri Lanka’s architecture while reshaping and learning in an effort to engage with European and Asian design cultures from a decolonial perspective.
Some of the exceptional architectural work of Bawa have been captured at the Aitken Spence Hotels such as Heritance Kandalama, Heritance Ahungalla and Heritance Ayurveda Maha Gedara.
Bawa’s experience of cave monasteries such as Kudumbigala, Dowa and Dambulla have been captured in Heritance Kandalama hotel.
