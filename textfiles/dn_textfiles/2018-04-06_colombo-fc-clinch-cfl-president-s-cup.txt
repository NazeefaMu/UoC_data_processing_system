The game from the first touch itself was fast pace and in the 6th minute owing to a mis-judgement by the main and assistant referees and a non fair play approach by Colombo FC players resulted in a goal against Saunders.
According to reports Saunders skipper Chanuka Eranga was elbowed on the face by an opposition player and he fell to the ground and was on the ground until the move from 10 meters from the center line had ended being a goal.
