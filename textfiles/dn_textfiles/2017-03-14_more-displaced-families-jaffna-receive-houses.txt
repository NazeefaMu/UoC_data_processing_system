More displaced families in Jaffna receive houses

‘Nallinakkapuram’, the newest Housing Complex, which provides 33 new houses for one more segment of the most deserving displaced families languishing in Jaffna-based welfare centres, was vested in the beneficiaries during a simple ceremony at the ‘Nallinakkapuram’ Community Hall.
The new housing complex, an extension of the Keeramalai Housing Project as its Phase - II, which housed 100 displaced families a few months ago, saw its successful completion as a collective effort of the Joint Project Management Team (JPMT) of technically qualified Army, Navy, Air Force personnel and members of the beneficiaries who toiled day and night to finish the project within 60 days.
Each new house cost Rs 1 million for the government and the beneficiaries still living in welfare centres were selected on the recommendations of the Jaffna District Secretariat in close consultation with relevant gramasevaka officials.
The Friday’s handover ceremony graced by Jaffna District Secretary Nagalingham Vethanayahan as its Chief Guest was organised by Jaffna Security Forces Commander Major General Mahesh Senanayake. He was behind the realization of the Keeramalai project earlier on the directions, given by Army Commander Lieutenant General Crishanthe De Silva. The simple ceremony on Friday distributed ownership certificates to the beneficiaries in accordance with the Hindu traditions.
Each house, constructed on a 20-perch land block consists of two bed rooms, living and dining area, kitchen, toilet and a bathroom. Major General Senanayake said the Army will provide all displaced people in Jaffna with new houses uninterrupted as per directions of the government. He said the Security Force Headquarters - Jaffna (SFHQ-J) will shortly construct 225 more houses in the Mavankalladdi area with the Navy and the Air Force.
Thellipala Divisional Secretary K. Sri Mohanan, Brigadier Sisira Pilapitiya, 513 Brigade Commander Colonel Sanath Aluvihare, 515 Brigade Commander Colonel Chandana Wickramasinghe, military officers, government officials participated.
