SLMA initiates drug, alcohol-prevention programme

The Sri Lanka Mahaweli Authority (SLMA) has initiated a programme aimed at eradicating drug and alcohol addiction within the Mahaweli development zones, on the instructions of President Maithripala Sirisena.
According to the Mahaweli Authority Institutional Development Department, the number of youth getting addicted to narcotics and alcohol is on the rise.
As such, it is planned to curtail the prevailing drug addiction among Mahaweli settlers, with the patronage of the Narcotics Control Bureau, Presidential Task Force, and National Dangerous Drugs Control Board.
Under this programme, it is planned to train a volunteer narcotics and drug-prevention force.
Hence, 60 to 100 youths such as school leavers, members of various rural volunteer agencies and farmer organizations who are permanent residents of Mahaweli zones, are to be selected for this purpose. It was reported that 1,000 such volunteers have already been trained and issued with proficiency certificates.
They are expected to start anti-alcoholism strategies at their own homes and extend their services from house-to-house.
A narcotics-prevention committee is being formed in every village in the Mahaweli zones, to coordinate this programme under the guidance of SLMA Institutional Development Director Mahendra Abewardana.
