Governor to formulate policy to protect fertile lands in WP

Newly-appointed Western Province Governor Dr. Hemakumara Nanayakkara said yesterday a national reconciliation committee will be established in the Western Province including all religious dignitaries.
There will also be an environment friendly programme to develop and protect paddy fields and fertile lands within the Province.The Governor was speaking at a ceremony held to felicitate former Western Province Governor K.C.Logeswaran in Colombo yesterday.
A ceremony to welcome new Governor Dr. Hemakumara Nanayakkara was also held parallel to the felicitation ceremony.He said it was wrong to describe the government as the central government.There is only a one government in Sri Lanka. All Provincial Councils come under the same government. It is the Governor who implements President’s vision and powers at Provincial level.
He said that many areas in Colombo are inundated even after a minor rain as a result of reclamation of paddy fields. Accordingly, constructions will be permitted only on bare land. I hope to implement a systematic programme to protect the environment in the Western Province.
Former Western Province Governor K.C.Logeswaran said a special programme to translate Provincial Council Ordinance into Sinhala, Tamil and English commenced during his tenure. I hope the present Governor will continue that work for the betterment of all,’ he added.
