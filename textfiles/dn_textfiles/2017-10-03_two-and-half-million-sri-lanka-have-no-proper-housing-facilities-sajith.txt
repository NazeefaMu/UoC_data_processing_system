Two and half million in Sri Lanka have no proper housing facilities: Sajith

“How can we celebrate World Habitat Day when almost 2.5 million families do not have proper housing facilities,” Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa asked at the National celebration of the 31st World Habitat Day held in Matara yesterday under the theme, ‘Housing Policies Affordable Holmes’.
“The celebration would be more meaningful had we provided these them with houses,” the Minister said.
“Of them, over 216,000 have no land or houses. Every
family has constitutional right to own land where they can build a house for them. New Constitution must include right of people to have dwellings, ” he said.
“The most important part of this year’s celebration is that 100 families in the Matara District received title deeds, 1,000 families received housing loans, 50 families were granted Sevana housing assistance,” he said,
‘Viru Sumithuru’ housing assistance to 25 families of war heroes, ‘Sonduru Piyasa’ loan schemes to 100 families and ‘Shilpa Saviya benefits’ to 127 young men and women are other benefits. They will cost the Government Rs. 16.53 million, he said.
“We have established 464 new villages within two and a half years. We will increase the figure to 500 by the
end of this year and the Finance Minister will provide us with funds to build 2,500 new model villages by
2020 before we seek your vote again,” the Minister said.
Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said he was pleased with the achievements made by the Housing Ministry to provide houses to every family in the country. He said he would propose to increase the allocations to the Ministry in the next budget.
Enterprise Development State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena thanked Minister Sajith Premadasa for taking forward his father’s vision ‘providing a suitable shelter to every citizen’.
MP Buddika Pathirana, Finance Ministry Secretary W. K. K. Athukorala, Matara District Secretary Pradeep Rathnayake and Sri Lanka Mannager for the UN-HABITIAT Dr Chanaka Thalpahewa spoke.
