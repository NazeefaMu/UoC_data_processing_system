IUSF protest causes heavy traffic

 
Heavy traffic is being reported surrounding the Borella area due to a protest march staged by the Inter University Students’ Federation (IUSF).
It is reported that IUSF and its affiliated organizations have taken part in the protest march.
Speaking to the Daily News online its convener Lahiru Weerasekara said that the protest was staged on several demands including the abolition of South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) and against the privatization of universities.
The IUSF staged a protest march on November 6 along with the Higher National Institutes in the island .
The protest was staged based on a number of demands including one that urged the government to abolish private universities. Their demands also included obtaining similar recognition to the HND as that of the Bachelor of Commerce degree.
However Cabinet approval was granted to the memorandum submitted by Lakshman Kiriella, Minister of Higher Education and Highways on the same day, to provide equal recognition to the Higher National Diploma in Accountancy (HNDA).
The decision was taken by the government with immediate effect, to solve the problem caused by the previous government’s decision to abolish the equal stand given to the Higher National Diploma in Accountancy.
