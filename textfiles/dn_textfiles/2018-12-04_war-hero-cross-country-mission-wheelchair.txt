War hero on cross-country mission on wheelchair

The Sri Lanka Army’s top brass including its Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake were at Dondra Point yesterday morning to encourage disabled war hero Corporal P. K. G. G. Karunarathna on his cross-country mission.
The Corporal set off from Dondra Point by wheelchair to traverse the length of Sri Lanka, to mark the International Day of Persons with Disabilities which fell yesterday.
Corporal Karunarathna joined the Sri Lanka Army in September 2007 and served in the Gajaba Regiment. He was wounded in the Humanitarian Operation and had both legs amputated.
He is an inmate of Abimansala III now. Corporal Karunarathna hopes to complete the gruelling 581 kilometres and reach Point Pedro on December 11.
