Country's youth a political football for decades: Sajith

The youth in Sri Lanka have been a political football for decades, and as such, they followed the path shown by politicians and were misled and and left jobless, said Housing and Constructions Minister Sajith Premadasa, adressing an election meeting.
Continuing, the minister said that the provision of a future for the youth generation is the bounden duty of the Yahapalana Regime. He said that a colossal sum of money has been allocated for the creation of a bright future for the youth of the country.
He said the previous regime used the youth generation to gain political mileage and not for the benefit of the youth themselves. The minister added that instead of politicians creating a future for the youth, the youth were compelled to create a bright future for politicians
Minister Premadasa said that with the UPFA coming into power in 1994, the country's youth were misled by politicians.
