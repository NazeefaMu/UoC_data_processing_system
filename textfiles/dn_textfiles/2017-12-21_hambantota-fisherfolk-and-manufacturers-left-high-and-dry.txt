Hambantota fisherfolk and manufacturers left high and dry

Dried fish manufacturers in the Hambantota district have been left high and dry as a result of dried fish being imported in large quantities. Such manufacturers in Kudawella and Mawella who engage in this work said that it is their only means of keeping their home fires burning, and that without it they are unable to meet the expenses of their families.
They said that women widowed as a result of the tidal wave tsunami in 2004, who engage in the dried fish industry as a means of self-employment, are most affected as a result of these imports.
Another issue facing the fishery industry in Hambantota is the inconvenience caused to fisherfolk due to a portion of land in the harbor being brought under vegetable cultivation by harbour officials.
This area of the fisheries harbor, used by the fisherfolk to anchor their fishing crafts and keep their fishing gear, has been brought under vegetable cultivation after the construction of a fence.
The fisher folk said that it was in this area that foundation stones were laid some time ago for the setting up of an iceplant. They have brought this matter to the notice of the State Minister of Fisheries, Dilip Vedaarachchi.
