The procession commenced from the Salgadu Ground in Anuradhapura and consisted of around 350 vehicles, including teachers, parents and students from all Lyceum branches.
The Lyceum Cavalcade procession had themes under education, modern technology, child abuse, a healthy mind and body, preserving our culture, saving our wildlife, saving our environment, saving our water and also highlighted the dangers of consuming alcohol and the dangers of smoking.
