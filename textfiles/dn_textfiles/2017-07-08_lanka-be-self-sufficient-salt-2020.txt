Lanka to be self-sufficient in salt by 2020

The Lanka Salt Corporation will be able to supply the entire quantity of salt that the country needs by 2020, Corporation Chairman Ayub Khan said.
He said new salterns were constructed adjoined to the Hambantota, Palatupana, and Bundala salterns.
Khan said old machinery were replaced and packeting salt is accelerated.
