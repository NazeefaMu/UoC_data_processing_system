Lahiru hands England U19s their first home-defeat after six years

Lahiru Kumara, stoutly-built seamer from Trinity College, Kandy completing an outstanding bowling effort with eleven-wicket match haul fired Sri Lanka U19 to a seven-wicket victory in the second and final Youth Test against their English counterparts at County Ground, Northampton to win the two-match series 1-0. It was England U19s first home defeat in a 4-day game after six years and it was the same opposition that defeated England on that occasion too in 2010.
The young Lions after they got acclimatized to English conditions sooner than expected played so well in the first leg of their tour, the two-match Youth Test series that even in the first four-day Test Sri Lanka after following on came back very strongly to force a stubborn draw in the end before their series-claimed victory in the second.
Unlike in the first match, Sri Lanka maintained their dominance right throughout the second Test especially with the ball as they could restrict the home team, who batted first on invitation, to a below-par 208 despite skipper Max Holden’s unbeaten century after an opening stand of 91 with Olly Westbury who made 45. From healthy 91 for no loss, they suddenly hiccoughed to 107 for six after Lahiru Kumara’s dramatic first spell that earned him the first five wickets to fall in the England’s innings before he wrapped up the innings to a meagre 208 with two more wickets in his second spell bringing his wicket-tally in the first innings to 7 for 82.
Lankans in their reply lost Dilan Jayalath, Wanindu Hasaranga and Sammu Ashan cheaply, but Avishka Fernando (49) and skipper Charith Asalanka (33) repaired the damage with two good stands for the second and fifth wickets before Navindu Nirmal who top scored with an unbeaten 80 and Jehan Daniel scoring a brisk 52 saw Sri Lanka gain a healthy first innings lead of 99. George Panayi and Ed Barnes claimed three wickets each for England.
Though England needed a good second innings total if they were to make any inroads in this crucial match, they could not quite do it after Lahiru Kumara who added four more wickets to his match tally and Praveen Jayawickrama claiming three wickets reduced England’s second innings to 192 in which only Olly Westbury could make a substantial score.
Sri Lanka requiring just 94 to win gunned down the target in just under 11 overs to win the match by seven wickets thereby winning the series 1-0.
England U19 : 208 in 82.2 overs (MDE Holden 111*, OE Westbury 45, Lahiru Kumara 7/82) and 192 in 66.4 overs (OE Westbury 41, Lahiru Kumara 4/52, Praveen Jayawickrama 3/38)
Sri Lanka U19 : 307 in 84 overs (Navindu Nirmal 80*, Jehan Daniel 52, Avishka Fernando 49, Charith Asalanka 33, George Panayi 3/51, Ed Barnes 3/38) and 94/3 in 10.2 overs (Charith Asalanka 40, George Panayi 2/25)
