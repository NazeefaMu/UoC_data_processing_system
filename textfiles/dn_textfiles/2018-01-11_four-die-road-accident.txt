Four die in road accident

Four people died in a motor accident on Tuesday night in Kilinochchiya, Mankulam, on the Kandy-Jaffna A9 Road, between the 237 and 238 kilometre posts.
According to Mankulum police sources, a van plying from Colombo to Jaffna rammed into a lorry parked on the roadside.
The victims were residents of the Jaffna area. Police believe that the driver of the van lost control due to his excessive speed. The bodies of the deceased were at the Kilinochchi hospital. Mankulum police are carrying out further investigations.
