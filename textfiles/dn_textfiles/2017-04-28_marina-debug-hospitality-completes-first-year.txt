The Marina by Debug Hospitality completes first year

The Marina, the exclusive member club by Debug Hospitality and Leisure in Bolgoda, recently celebrated a special milestone completing its first year of operations in Sri Lanka.
Built overlooking the serene Bolgoda Lake, The Marina has made a name in the local leisure sector as the perfect venue to exclusively enjoy quality time with your family or friends and experience adrenaline-filled watersport activities.
Expressing his views on this milestone, Moiz Najmudeen, Chairman of Debug Hospitality and Leisure said, “The Marina by the Bolgoda Lake successfully completed its first year of operations, serving an exclusive sector of clients. By providing an exceptional experience on and off the water with our services, we have been able to grow our number of members as well. In a short span of time, the club has become a key venue as a great promoter of water-based recreational activities with a wide range of water sports activities.”
Further strengthening its presence in the country, Debug will be launching ‘Amber Collection’ – a pioneering concept in Sri Lanka to luxuriate the comforts of houseboats and boutique apartments. The high-end collection from Debug Hospitality and Leisure will offer a new dimension of relaxation for leisure seekers as well as for people who are looking for an apartment with all the amenities of a modern house.
Debug will also launch their boutique apartment that consists of four two-bedroom apartments and four studio apartments for those looking for home away from home. Debug Hospitality and Leisure will be taking part in the upcoming Sancharaka Udawa, an exhibition organized by the Sri Lanka Association of Inbound Tour Operators (SLAITO) to promote niche tourism products and services in the country, from May 5 to 6. The company will have a special stall at the event premises where the Amber Collection will be officially launched for the Sri Lankan public.
Further commenting about their new venture, Chiranjeewa Amarasinghe, General Manager of Debug Hospitality and Leisure stated, “We are glad to introduce our latest concept - Amber Collection - in Sri Lanka at this year’s Sancharaka Udawa, which will bring a luxurious experience to all Sri Lankans.”
