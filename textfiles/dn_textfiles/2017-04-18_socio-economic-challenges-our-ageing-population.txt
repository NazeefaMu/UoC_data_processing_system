Socio-economic challenges of our ageing population

The ageing of Sri Lanka's population has long been presented as one of the most serious challenges facing the nation in the coming decades. Whilst it is certainly a problem in need of attention, to label it a crisis is to overstate the case. The Government has a range of policy levers open to them to respond to the budgetary effects of ageing.
Let us first take a brief look at the problem. Statistics show that the Sri Lankan population above the age of 60 years was 2.5 million in 2012 which is 12.5% of the total population whereas projection shows that we would have elderly population of about 3.6 million by 2021, which is 16.7% of the total population. And, if the trend continues, by 2041, one-quarter of our population would be elderly.
Our current population, aged more than 65 years, is around 2.11 and by 2030, it is estimated to be 3.33 million, over 57 per cent increase.
These numbers suggest a very big increase in the dependency ratio and is consequently a cause for concern because with it will place a higher burden on the Government and the shrinking working population.
This is the crux of the problem. The question is - Are we prepared to carry the burden? Or, do we have serious plans or innovations to mitigate the adverse effects of this problem?
Independent living
At a recent seminar, themed “Responding to the Global Challenge of an Ageing Population,’ Dr. Mahendra Gondsalkorale, retired consultant on geriatric medicine made some revealing disclosures. He said that most of our elderly people have developed age-associated illnesses like dementia and also Alzheimer’s disease. Above all, he added, they need support for independent living.
It means, greater need for adaptive transport, recreational facilities, adaptive housing products. And on the services, acute medical care, stroke and orthogeriatric services, hospital-based elders’ assessment units and rehabilitation, general surgical and psycho-geriatric liaison and specialist clinics. TIA Clinics, Parkinson’s, Rapid Access Clinics, Community services, day hospitals and care home outreach services.
All these add up to big investments in the health sector. Of course, we can be happy that our people are living longer. It represents one of the crowning achievements of our health services but also a significant challenge to the Government. Longer lives must be planned for and programmes executed well.
On the other hand, societal aging may affect economic growth and many other issues, including the sustainability of families, the ability of the Government and communities to provide resources for older citizens.
No easy answers
There are no easy answers to this problem. Some Governments have already begun to plan for the long term. The window of opportunity for reform is closing fast as the pace of population aging accelerates. In some countries, the share of gross domestic product devoted to health care for older people is expected to more than double in upcoming years.
For a country like Sri Lanka with a struggling economy, the challenges may seem daunting, but a host of opportunities await us as well.
Retirement age
Many experts argue it is a mistake to base calculations for elders solely on a fixed retirement age of 60. If life expectancy increases dramatically, a sensible policy is to allow some increase in the retirement age.
Encouraging older workers to remain longer in the labour force is often cited as one of the viable solutions to fiscal pressures and macro-economic challenges related to population aging. Some countries have adapted what is known as “phased-in-retirement” system.
According to this method, an employee who is approaching retirement age continues working with a reduced workload, and eventually transit from full-time work to full-time retirement. This also includes part-time work for pensioners who wish to remain employed.
Mature influence
This method of gradual retirement can be beneficial to the society, employers, and employees. First, phased-in retirement allows continuity in tax revenues and reduced expenditure on retirement benefits, which holds particular importance for fiscal and macro-economic stability. Second, elders can be valuable to organisations and younger colleagues due to their knowledge and experience. And third, late-life work has positive health and perceived well-being consequences for older employees.
The ‘mature influence’ of workplace societies is also a major achievement. Many business organisations which adapted this concept are happy with the results. The demographic change offers opportunities to harness the experience, expertise and creativity of such a large number of older people. Tapping into a wider pool of talent, experience and skills enables businesses to increase productivity, build competitive advantage and improve the bottom line.
Volunteer work
In cases where elders are unable to take advantage of phased-in retirement - due to health issues, family obligations, or skills mismatch – the Government could promote and reward volunteering, care work, craft and artistic work among the elderly. Such unpaid activities improve the quality of the social fabric, help the well-being of those engaging in them, contribute to the economy, and reduce healthcare and welfare costs.
Volunteering is among the most important pro-social behaviours with many social and individual benefits. It has been scientifically proven that late-life volunteers have lower rates of deteriorating mental and physical health and delayed mortality. Because of these benefits, national policies should seek to facilitate, reward, and adapt such opportunities for older individuals. And work undertaken by older people should be recognized for its value and rewarded financially.
Further, providing incentives and encouraging the elderly to engage in creative work related to painting, music, or creative writing can also be beneficial to society and prevent social isolation. Government can promote such activities by financing arts and crafts courses in social clubs or community centres for older participants.
Central Provident Fund
Transforming the present EPF/ETF into a mandatory Social Security Savings Fund has been suggested as another way of solving the Sri Lanka’s elder issue. Instead the current deductions – 8 % from employee and 12% from employer – change to 12% from employee and 20% from employer. With such increased amounts available, we can develop a good social security system, which can serve to meet elders’ retirement, housing and healthcare needs. Singapore is a classic example to follow.
Short-term costs
It’s also important to recognize that implementing these programmes and schemes may have short-term costs. Employers and older workers may face bargaining costs related to negotiating phased-in retirement options. Employers could also incur expenses related to restructuring or adapting tasks, while local governments may need to open community centres to accommodate volunteering and other activities for the elderly. Nonetheless, the long-run welfare benefits to society will likely exceed these short-run costs and improve fiscal and macroeconomic health.
Major concerns
A big factor in determining the impact of our ageing population is the projected rates of our economic growth. For instance, a decline in economic growth will increase the pressure on public finances from an ageing population.
At the same time, for the elderly individuals, the issues may focus on the shortfall of retirement savings. And if interest rates also collapse, it will affect those who had chosen to save over the past decades.
Irrespective of economic growth status, there are four major concerns of our ageing population. (1) They want a model of health and social care for the elderly in tune with the changing need and time. As no such model for older people exists in Sri Lanka, it may be an opportunity for innovation in the health system development, though it is a major challenge; (2) They want some type of part-time work to keep them productive and occupied. Much of the discussion about working longer has focused on expanding opportunities for phased retirement or part-time employment; (3) They want avenues for further education and lifetime skill formation. Learning is a lifelong process. An elder education program can be a highly successful if it is done with dedication. It can be online or group classes aimed at developing simple lifetime skills; (4) They want above-the-average return for the savings. At the moment, commercial banks offer 1 per cent which is quite inadequate.
These all require further funding, whether from the tax system, other public expenditure savings, public-private initiatives or economic growth. Ageing has an impact on all aspects of human life including the social, economic, cultural, and political domains. Understanding and providing for ageing is, therefore, an important issue for the twenty-first century.
