Ian Bell hits rare ton in tight Warwickshire-Glamorgan game

LONDON, Sunday - Ian Bell’s first Championship ton in two years steered Warwickshire to a 30-run first-innings lead over Glamorgan as they were dismissed for 250. But the visitors reached 55 for no wicket at the close, now 25 runs ahead.
Bell’s serene unbeaten 106 off 248 balls was supported by Jonathan Trott (run out in a mix-up with Bell for 57) and number nine Chris Wright (29).
Lukas Carey (3-56) and Andrew Salter (2-65) bowled well before Timm van der Gugten (4-65) cleaned up the tail.
Warwickshire were reduced to 173-7 in mid-afternoon before a stand of 69 between Bell and Wright gave the advantage back to the Division Two leaders.
England Test opener Alastair Cook kept himself in good form with a fourth first-class half-century of the summer to help county champions Essex rally against Lancashire at Old Trafford. Lancashire earned their third batting point before being bowled out for 301.
Cook survived a dropped catch on 22 and the early loss of Varun Chopra to Graham Onions as Essex raced to 119-1.
But Cook (58) and Tom Westley (41) both went in a burst of wickets before Ryan ten Doeschate (43) took Essex to 221-6. Rikki Clarke took 5-29 as Surrey gained the upper hand on day two by forcing Hampshire to follow on at Southampton.
Surrey were bowled out for 368, with Rory Burns making 151 and Ben Foakes 90 as Fidel Edwards claimed 5-93.
But Hampshire were soon in trouble against the Surrey seamers and lasted under 50 overs, with only three batsmen reaching double figures.Rilee Rossouw top scored with 46 in their 135 all out and they will bat again on day three, 233 runs behind. AFP
