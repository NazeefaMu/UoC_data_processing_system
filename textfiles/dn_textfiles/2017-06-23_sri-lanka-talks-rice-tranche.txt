Sri Lanka in talks for rice tranche

Sri Lanka has opened immediate talks with three countries to procure a rice tranche to stabilise its domestic markets.
“We are looking for par-boiled (Nadu) and Samba categories now” Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen said yesterday.
The Minister met Thailand’s Ambassador designate Chulamanee Chartsuwan, Indonesia’s Ambassador Gusti Ngurah Ardiyasa and Pakistan’s acting High Commissioner Dr. Sarfraz Ahmad Khan Sipra at the Ministry..
“We are keen to procure rice for Sri Lanka from you through a Government to Government process, but are open for your private sectors’ support as well if necessary. The Cooperative Wholesale Establishment (CWE) will be the focal point for this effort and will be in contact with you continuously. After one of you are picked as the supplier of this volume, based on a transparent international procurement process, our expert team consisting of my officials, food technologists, and rice experts will arrive in your country to inspect and certify the entire stock before it would be shipped to Colombo.
“We are looking for par-boiled (Nadu) and Samba categories at this moment. We can start with 300,000 metric tonnes. Even if Sri Lanka would choose one of you as the supplier in this case and leave the others, we are still eagerly looking forward to enhance bilateral trade with all of you-in many other ways,”Bathiudeen told the ambassadors.
All the Ambassadors pledged immediate support to the President’s efforts to procure the rice tranche.
They also clarified the processes of Government to Government procurement at a time like this in their respective nations to Minister Bathiudeen and Ministry Secretary Lokuhetti.
The Ambassadors said they shall immediately get in touch with their respective governments as soon as Sri Lanka sends its bidding details and gives them the go-ahead.
