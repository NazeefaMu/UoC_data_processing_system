Joes triumph 26-22 but Kingswood win hearts of the crowd

St. Joseph’s College came out on top but the gutsy Kingswood College Kandy rugby team won the hearts of many spectators including the Colombo crowd who witnessed a superb game of rugby dished out by both teams.
St.Joseph’s eventually ran out winners by 26 points (4 tries, 3 conversions) to 22 (3 tries, 2 conversions, 1 penalty) in their Singer ‘A’ Division inter-schools league rugby tournament first round game played at Havelock Park yesterday. At half time Joes led 19-12.
Kingswood forwards fought like terriers in the entire match combining effectively with their three quarters giving no room for their opponents winning all the good ball and line outs but St. Joseph’s finally came out on top and won the game due to the individual brilliance of their star wing three quarter K.D. Kavinda who scored three breathtaking tries.
Joes scored first and went into a 7-nil lead when winger Dulanjana Piyatissa out foxed and went through the Kingswood defence, where he finally drew the final defender and sent Kavinda over to score a try with a superb offload. Fly half Santhush Algama made the conversion.
Immediately Kingswood cut down the lead to 7-5 when their full back Dinal Ekanayake sliced through the Josephian three quarters to score a corner flag try. Scrum half Hirusha Sampath missed the conversion.
In the 18th minute of play St. Joseph’s increased their lead to 12-5 when Kavinda collecting the ball from a sweeping three quarter move dived over to score a try which Algama fired across the conversion.
Joes increased their lead in the 32nd minute of the game when Algama went through the defences of the Kingswood lads to touch down for a try which he himself converted to make the score 19-5 in favour of the Maradana boys.
Just on the stroke of half time Kingswood outside centre Seneviratne scored the try of the match when he dummied and scampered through for a try after a 40 metre dash far right to close the gap to 19-12. Sampath made the conversion.
After the turn around with pressure mounting on the Joes, Kingswood added more pressure on the Maradana boys who crumbled down when in the 47th minute Kingswood prop forward Chandraratne barged through for a try off a ruck. Sampath made the conversion to equal the score to 19-all.
In the 60th minute Kingswood grabbed the lead for the first time in the game 22-19 when Sampath put over a spectacular 45 metre penalty.
Joes sealed the game when off a superb three quarter move Kavinda darted down to score his third and match winning try. Algama, who had a fine game with his boot slotted in the conversion in the 63rd minute to make the score 26-22.
