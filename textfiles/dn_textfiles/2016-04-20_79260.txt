Let go of it like Ajahn Brahm

Ajahn Brahm has become well known over the world as a household name for preaching the essence of the Buddha’s teaching. He uses both a simplified expression as well as an anecdotal techniques to present some of the lesser known factors such as ‘sathi’, ‘nibbida’ and ‘dhyana’. He is presumably responsible for popularizing the Buddha’s complex teachings.
This British-born learned Thai monk presents episodes from his own experiences linking the orient and the occident paving the way for ‘happy living’ and a path to lasting joy. The Buddha has stated that ‘happiness is the most profitable ideal denoting the concept as ‘santhutti paraman dhanam’. Ajahn Brahm extends the phenomenon from various points of view. In the first instance, he denotes this in his collection of poular tales that came to be titled as ‘Opening the Doors of your Heart’.
Reading page by page and obtaining the material as creative communication exercise, I was expecting more material.
As a blissful blessing, I had the chance to read his latest contribution titled as ‘The Art of Disappearing’. This book which contains eleven short delightful chapters came as a welcome variant to other Dhamma publications that appear both in English and Sinhala. The material in the series of chapters is classified in the form of an array of mirrors which reflect our own inner conditions in daily experiences.
I had the chance to see my inner self via these reflections. This paved the way for a rediscovery of my self. What is significant and different is that Ajahn helps us know the way to learn better conditions of happiness as against the most boring and monotonous living conditions.
He transcends the narrow barriers of using the religious and spiritual factors in a manual or a handbook In the opening chapter, he stresses that the true purpose of practicing Buddhism is to let go of everything, not to get more things like attainments to show off to your friends.’
The entire work encircles the concept of letting go of theme which ultimately makes one happier than he was earlier.
From this point onwards, he traces the various steps through which one could achieve the state of being happy by letting go off. The concept of letting off too is linked to the term ‘disengagement’.
Ajahn Brahm states that the ‘nibbida’ means disengaging. The concept is well explained as follows.
“You must sit there and you don’t involve yourself in what you are experiencing. By not involving yourself in what you are experiencing, you stand back from life. It is almost like rejecting it the sort of rejection that makes things disappear.”
Ajahn reiterates: “When you understand the suffering in the world, you see the world as a load of rubbish. Because it is rubbish, you disengage.” The teaching of disengagement of the ultimate teaching of letting off.
Ajahn makes the reader take up to meditation process not as a tedious mental exercise, but as a way of perceiving one’s own innerness. As such, he underlines that happiness comes from disappearing.
He takes into account two main suttas of the Buddha: Dhammachakkappavattana Sutta and Samma Ditthi Sutta. The book could be read and understood from any page you wish.
Perhaps this is one of the best Dhamma gifts given to the world. Clinging on to the worldly issues make us suffer. If ‘I’ disappear the suffering is over.
To see that I disappear it is the disappearance of ill will, hatred and violence. As Ajahn underlines: When you are demanding you are there. When you have ill will, you are there. When you have craving, you are there.
All these things create a sense of self that thinks it owns things and gets involved. So you are the problem.
The disappearance from ‘I’ and ‘you’ makes you happy.
