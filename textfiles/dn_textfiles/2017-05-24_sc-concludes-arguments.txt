SC concludes arguments

The Supreme Court yesterday concluded arguments put forward in support and against the bill titled “Registration of Electors (Special Provisions)”.
All parties in the petitions were directed to file their written submissions on or before May 25. The Supreme Court’s determination over the proposed bill will be communicated to the Speaker.
The Supreme Court bench comprised Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, Justice Sisira de Abrew and Justice Nalin Perera.
Two Special Determination petitions were filed by MP Udaya Gammanpila and former Maharagama Urban Council Member Nishantha Wimalachandra, seeking a declaration that the Bill shall become law only trough a two-thirds majority in Parliament and the approval of the people at a referendum.
Wimalachandra stated that a bill titled “Registration of Electors (Special Provisions)” was presented to Parliament and placed on the Order Paper on May 3, 2017.
The petitioner stated that the long title of the Bill provides it to pass a law to make special provisions to exempt internally displaced persons from certain requirements of the Registration of Electors Act, No. 44 of 1980 and to provide for matters connected therewith.
The said Bill has been placed in Parliament violating mandatory procedure provided for in Article 78 of the Constitution as the Bill had not been published in the Government Gazette in terms of Article 78 of the Constitution, petitioner Nishantha Wimalachandra added.
The petitioner states the clauses 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, of the Bill are inconsistent with Articles 3, 4, 12(1), 12(2), 78(1), 78(2) of the Constitution.
This special determination petition was filed through senior counsel Kanishka Vitharana and counsel H.M.Tillekaratne. Deputy Solicitor General Janak de Silva appeared for the Attorney General.
