All party committee to decide on Constitution: Amaraweera

UPFA General Secretary and Fisheries and Acquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera yesterday said that a special committee comprising the representatives of all parties in Parliament will take the final decision with regard to the Constitution.
He was responding to queries raised by journalists at a ceremony held at Beliatta yesterday.
“The committee will decide whether country needs a new Constitution or Amendments need to be brought to the present Constitution,” Minister Amaraweera said. He said that Local Government election will be held within this year under new electoral system. “The majority of people want the Preferential voting system abolished and they want a member who represents their electorate,”he said.
