Constitution must guarantee women’s political representation

A petition signed by 221 Sri Lankan citizens, women and men, from different regions of the country, concerned with democracy and good governance, including Dr. Kumari Jayawardene, Deshabandu Jezima Ismail, Prof. Savitri Goonesekera, Prof. Maithree Wickremasinghe, Dr. Selvy Thiruchandran was presented to the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly on September 6.
They called for Constitutionally guaranteed provisions to address the critical under representation of women in political institutions.
They reminded MPs now sitting in the Constitutional Assembly deliberating on a new Constitution that women are less than 6 percent in Parliament; 4 percent in Provincial Councils and 2 percent in Local Authorities.
They said that women’s groups in particular and the Parliamentary Women’s Caucus have advocated strongly for affirmative action including before the Steering Committee and the Dinesh Gunawardene Parliamentary Select Committee on Electoral Reforms.
They reminded MPs that successive UNP and UNFPA manifestos since the early 2000s promised to increase women’s representation in Provincial and local government as did the Maithripala Sirisena manifesto titled ‘A New Sri Lanka for Women’, all of which acknowledged the under-representation of women in politics.
They noted that the Public Representations Committee on Constitutional Reform (PRCCR) established by the Cabinet, in its report of 2016, heard “resounding calls for special measures to ensure greater representation of women in political bodies and all other decision-making bodies” indicating this call was made by “both women and men across the country”. The PRCCR said “Many submissions suggested special measures such as quotas ranging from 25 percen to 50 percent in order to ensure the participation of women.”
The petitioners recommended that all candidates, women or men, nominated to contest first past the post (FPP) seats from each party under the majoritarian system shall be in the proportion of not less than 30 percent or more than 70 percent; under the Proportional Representation (PR) system and for bonus or compensatory seats, all political parties entitled to such seats shall submit a closed zippered list alternating between female and male candidates; the proportion of either women or men in all independent commissions appointed by the Constitutional Council and in all current statutory bodies and those that may be established in the future, shall be not less than 30 percent or more than 70 percent.
