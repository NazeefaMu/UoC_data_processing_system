Once upon a time  tales told twice

I have two books lying on my table. One is a compilation of eight folktales titled as ‘Eight folktales from eight countries’ (Rataval Ataka Janakatha Atak) as adapted by the well-known writer Piyasena Wickramage. The other is a translation of a science fiction written by Bhadraji Mahinda Jayatilaka in English titled as Purple Planet that has won an award for the best children’s book translated into Sinhala Amritha Wickramage titled as Dura Eta Dam Polowa. Both books attempt to capture a subject filled with reality transformed into fantasy.
I say thus the former work that is basically is folk, orally transmitted through the ages down by the humans who wanted to raise questions on why what and how things exist, as they are.
As Malinowski once stated all folktales remain to be the legacy of the folk knowledge orally transmitted transcending the cultural barriers. In turn when science fiction came to be written down by such writers as Jules Verne and HG Wells they too were influenced by this legacy. Today the time has come to realize that both genres, folk and sci-fi are fantasies, which in turn answer some of the same questions like, what, why and how things happen.
Resourceful mission
I am not going to address these issues at length. Instead, the primary attempt in the folk compilation happens to be the depiction of similarities in the resourceful mission of the folktale narrates drawn from eight nations. They include New Zealand, Greece, North America, Mexico, Nigeria, Ireland and Japan. The compiler Wickramage as the epilogue to the compilation states has been spending a certain period in New Zealand in a library utilizes a library from his benefit in the process of obtaining folk material for a wider field of studies. In a relaxed manner, the compiler cum adaptor of these folk narratives attempts to provide ‘new meanings’ to certain age-old adages linked to folk narratives.
One such concept is the rationale behind the term ‘once upon a time’. The term is common to all the nations not only as a catchphrase but also as an oral transmission form, despite the categories such as parables, fairy tales and religious narratives. Henceforth the references to unseen forces such as gods and goddesses are regarded as invisible and undiscovered cosmic forces that transcend the mere findings.
References too are made to similar studies of the pantheon of gods upwards and downwards with special reference to the god of gods Zeus. The qualities such as over=pervading compassions in the hearts of humans are treated as the most powerful spiritual force unfathomable.
As most folktale researchers like James Fraser has underlined, it is quite difficult to perceive how the great folk narratives came to be created. It is still a mysterious factor that lay embedded in the realm of the human research process. The life-giving forces to humans via rivers, seas, mountains and the process of rituals linked to them too are sensitively captured in these narratives.
Magical issues
Even though the term ‘magic realism’ is used today by the post-modernistic critic today, the term has its roots in folklore. As some folk narrative revolve around, magical issues such as bringing back to those who are dead and passed away, the narrative form itself may visualize the roots in folklore common to the orient and occident. It is actually the mask and the face, identified as false and real.
The healing processes of great folk medical doctors as seen in the folk narratives though branded witchcraft may be rediscovered in the most modern rediscoveries in the medical field today. One good example is the therapy or chiktisa as it is known by the medical healers. A modern reader of folk narrative, I feel may get a chance to rediscover some of these literary nuances via the compilation. Then coming on to the children’s book, Dura Atha Dam Polowa as translated by Amritha Wickramage, the reader may have the chance of entering into the more modern standpoint on the scientific stance as regards the advent of a child into an alien planet where he discovers his own living conditions in a different manner. The fascinating science fiction revolves around the imaginative journey of a child these realms of aliens enable him to gather not only mere information but also about flying saucers and the various discoveries made on the same.
Amritha is cited as a scientist settled in New Zealand. This is her third transaction. To her credit, she has written seven books so far. The two works have to be regarded as gifts of a father and a daughter providing knowledge o with the masses.
The narrative technique mostly used in the process of communication is observed as a dialogue that embraces a spoken dialect. Perhaps the fascinating fantasy deserves this flavour over and above the classical flavour. Both books are well illustrated in order to add colour to the narratives. The eight folk narratives as selected from eight cultures and the science fiction from our culture created as make-believe could tend to give way for a comparative interpretation as a classroom exercise in creative communication patterns. I feel that as classroom creative exercises both in literature and communication are waning off from teaching, these works could enable a healthy stimulation for the teacher as well as the student.
