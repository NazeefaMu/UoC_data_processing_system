In celebration of their Alma Mater’s 100th anniversary this year, the students of Visakha Vidyalaya present “The Songs we Love”, a choir performance by both the school’s Senior and Junior choirs.

Senior Choir Leaders Kethmi Samarasinghe and Tharani Medawatte say, “It’s been great putting this show together, especially after such a long time, since our last choir show. The excitement is increasing among the cast and they are so looking forward to this as most of the songs were selected by the students themselves”.
Leader of the Junior Choir Kusheshi de Zoysa (who is also the Deputy Leader of the Senior Choir) added, “These few weeks have been hectic … learning lyrics, choreography and balancing studies. The girls are both passionate and very enthusiastic”.
