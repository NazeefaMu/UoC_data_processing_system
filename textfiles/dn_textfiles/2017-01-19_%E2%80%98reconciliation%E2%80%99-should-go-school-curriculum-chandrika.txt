‘Reconciliation’ should go to school curriculum: Chandrika

Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) Chairperson former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga yesterday said that reconciliation should be included as a subject in the school curriculum.
Addressing a ceremony to mark the National Integration and Reconciliation Week at Ananda College, Kumaratunga said her office was discussing the matter with the Education Ministry.
The event was part of ONUR's programme to promote national unity and integration at the school level. Kumaratunga said education is not merely about learning subjects, such as languages, religions and sciences. "If we are to cultivate a wholesome education, social education should be a key component," she said.
"We must do a comprehensive study on what social issues we have, what could be the solutions and what we should do about them. The Education Department has consented to include Reconciliation for National Unity as a subject to the local syllabus," Kumaratunga said.
"During my term of office, I included Peace Education as one subject, but the previous regime discontinued the programme. We are going to make it a compulsory subject," Kumaratunga said. She said many Sinhala and Tamil students like to learn each other’s languages, but the lack of qualified teachers is a major obstacle. She said there is a shortage of 6,000 Tamil language teachers in government schools.
She said government institutions lack officers who can execute their responsibilities in Tamil language.
The former President expressed her anticipation of people abiding by their oath on national integration and reconciliation.
National Integration and Reconciliation State Minister A.H.M. Fowzie said Sinhala Buddhists are not racists. "When I competed for the Colombo district, there were 23 Sinhala, Buddhist candidates with me. But Sinhala Buddhist people voted and made me the first in the district, as they know I am not a racist," he said.
The State Minister said there are certain groups who attempt to topple the government by provoking racism and religious animosities. "We can never prosper if we give up to ethnic and religious animosities," Fowzie said.
