D.K. Weeratunge
Kind-hearted social worker
It was really a day of mourning for mostly everyone in Hatton, irrespective of race, caste or creed when the fatal news echoed at the dawn of January 31, 2017, that D.K. Weeratunge passed away at Nawaloka Hospital, Colombo, consequent to a surgery. His untimely demise was an irreparable loss to Hatton, especially to the families of DKW Plastic Industries and DKW-Aqua International (Pvt) Ltd, whose income depended on him as an employer. It also left an infallible void in the context of institutional, social and religious environments, mostly in the Central Province where all his social activities were centrallized. He was a genuine social worker who had served society in all aspects.

D.K. Weeratunge was born on October 1, 1932. His parents were Dickowita Kankanamge Don John and Bopagoda Hettige Punchihamy (Kodagoda Hammie). This family was well recognized by the Government. His father was a 'Vel Vidane,' which was a post offered by the Gate Mudliyars of the Government in the old colonial days with no remuneration, purely on the basis that the applicants were hailed from the descendants of families recognised by the state.
Weeratunge had his formal education at Angunna Badulla Mixed School situated in Matara. He had the opportunity to enter into Central College, Telijjawila, where he was a student under former Commissioner General of Examinations late H.C. Wimalasuriya.
Notwithstanding the environment for his secondary education, he had to leave his parents in order to assist his uncle in his grocery business in Hatton. Having joined his uncle, he admitted himself in Sri Pada College, Hatton, for his further studies. This was somewhere in the 1950s. At this time, the post colonial social-economic ruins were already prevailing in the plantation sector in upcountry. He had to choose English as his medium for study and other appropriate subjects to match the society at that time.
With the assignment shouldered upon him by his uncle, Weeratunge was compelled to pay attention to the retail business after school. He underwent immense hardships during this period even to the extent of making a cement floor with mat and pillow as his bed. Amidst sleepless nights, he managed to obtain a simple pass in S.S.C. in English Medium which was recognised as “qualified’ to enter into the government service. He was the only student who got through this examination in Sri Pada College for the first time. Former Principal of Sri Pada College late Hettige requested Weeratunge to join the staff as an English Assistant on a salary scale of Rs. 120 per month.
Weeratunge was fortunate to capture his career in business as he possessed the knowledge in English and Tamil, in addition to his mother tongue, Sinhala. The gift of the gab he gained paved the way for successful business, as aimed by him. He never turned as deaf ear to the grievances of the workers who were employed under him and therefore, knew their problems and solved them in an amicable manner.
He found Rupa Widanapathirana, a teacher from Porathota Vidyalaya, Akuressa, as his partner and their marriage took place at Matara. Athula and Iromie were his lovely children.
With the introduction of opened economy in 1977 by the government, Weeratunga chose poly packaging as new business with his good friend, Aktha Careem as a partner. Whilst the then Minister of Industries Cyril Mathew approved this new industry, Dr. Wickrama Weerasuriya and his cousin S.M.A.G. Perera were among the gentlemen who assisted in extending their co-operation to start this new venture.
Initially, a cadre of approximately 10 employees were engaged and later, it increased to as much as 400 with the speedy development of the business. He was much strengthened to face challenges in business and even entered into the export market, joining hands with Aqua Packaging, Wattala, thus fulfilling his ambition.
Where Corporate Social Responsibilities are concerned in the latest buzzword in the private sector companies, and also a criteria to measure how a private sector complies with companies in modern business tendencies, Weeratunge was practising it performing all his contributions to society long before the introduction of C.S.R.
Weeratunge actively contributed towards poverty alleviation by creating direct and indirect employment opportunities to the unemployed youths in the vicinity. His prime objective was to find human resources for his business within the area itself. This was the secret behind the long journey of his business. He never hired qualified employees to engage in the business, but stretched hands for the youths to come up to the levels of engineers, technicians and accountants etc. He had a remarkable skill of identifying talents by observing one's behaviour. The ethnic unity, peacefulness and harmony among the races always became a model to the most burning issue in the Tamil-dominant Hatton.
Weeratunge, in no way, enjoyed the profits earned from his trade for himself, but shared with others in the society. His contributions towards the health sector in the area was of much importance. Be it a construction, donation or a maintenance, he was always at the doorstep for any request. Leaving aside the government hospitals in the area in general, the annual maintenance of Ward No. 09 in the Kalubowila Hospital could be treated as one among social activities launched out of Hatton for his generosity.
He foresaw the need for a cultural centre in Hatton for the residents of the area to have meetings, conferences, stage dramas or other social activities. In consultation with his close associates, he was able to obtain a land for this purpose and complied with this requirement, completing the construction within the scheduled date. These buildings are currently used for Y.M.B.A., Cultural Centre, Weera’ Elders’ Home and for other activities.
Although we could write books on the autobiography of the late D. K. Weeratunge, we call him a genuine philanthropist not only for the Hatton area, but also for the whole island.
He spent millions for the Hatton Buddhist Temple and other temples in the area. He spent for the 'Dhana Shalawa' for serving alms to 50 priests in commemoration for his deceased daughter Ironie Weerathunga, construction of pagodas for Ruwanpura and Kudaoya Buddhist Temples, laying of marbles for 'Salapathala Maluwa' in 'Mahaweli Seya' in Kotmale, besides rehabilitation of ruined temples in his own villages after the Tsunami disaster.
For senior employees who worked under him, he paid his gratitude by providing lands for their shelter and this land is now registered under local authority as 'Weertunge Pura.' Among others, erection of pedestrian crossings covered with overhead roofs leading to Sri Pada College and the parlour at Kudaoya cemetery are some. He was also a foster parent to numerous schoolchildren, even up to university and other institutions, which is worthwhile to mention.
He was a successful businessman, great social worker, active industrialist and above all a kind-hearted employer.
Before we conclude this brief note on appreciation to the newspapers, late Weeratunge will no doubt shower the blessings of the Triple Gem to attain the most blissful Nibbana for the meritorious deeds he had done towards religions. Although he will no more participate in society physically, the name “Weeratunge” will be written in gold letters in the history of Hatton for what he had done for humanity.
Dr. M. N. Weerasuriya,
President
Y.M.B.A., Hatton
Lakshmi Wikkramatilleke
Compassionate soul
I write this appreciation in memory of my dear aunt Lakshmi, whose birthday we remember on May 25. She was suddenly called to rest with Jesus on November 11, 2016, at the age of 93 years in Nugegoda and her Husband Clive Wikkramatillake, predeceased her in August, 1980, both leaving memories in life. They were blessed with three sons, namely, Charith, Suren and Ranjan, all of whom are married and doing well by profession.
Aunty Lakshmi, was the third in a family of five to late Dr. Hector and Mabel Ekanayake. Clarence and Lalitha (Lala) were the older, while Eric and my mother, Premeani, were the younger siblings.
It was Aunty Lakshmi who supported her Father in taking care of the name very meticulously when they lost their mother Mabel at a very tender age. She continued to live in their ancestral home in Nugegoda and grew a beautiful garden which she took much pleasure in till the very end.
She was a caring and compassionate lady who was a mother not only to her three sons, but also to my sister and I who lived next door. In her care for us, she was very fair-minded. She taught us to be loyal and keep the unity of the family whatever our differences may have been.
She worked as a secretary at Ford Rhodes and was also a teacher at St. John’s College, Nugegoda. Our Christmas lunch was traditionally at her home and the fun, frolic and laughter we had during the get-togethers lie engraved in my memory.
She was of course in the centre of the laughter with her humorous stories—somehow being one who saw the funny side of life. Life presented her with a great challenge when she lost her dear husband Clive in 1980. However, her strong faith in the Lord gave the courage to pick up and move forward and looked after her three children. She gave them love and care and they all know that their dear mother has done her best and that it will take some time to heal their hearts.
She was an active member of the Mother’s Union at St. Mary and John’s Church and served as their enrolling member. She also served as the President of the Diocesan Mother’s Union.
Reading the Bible and morning devotions were an important part of her daily routine. Reading, gardening and collecting stamps were her hobbies. Playing Scrabble was her favourite pass time. Making jigsaw puzzles of over 1,000 pieces also kept her going as her mobility reduced. She was a regular Sunday worshipper in her Church until Christmas, 2015. Aunty Lakshmi was a animal lover too. She always had a dog or two in the house and was a Member of the Animal Welfare Society, Dehiwala. We thank God for her life.
Aunty Lakshmi, you left us suddenly, which was a great shock and loss to the family circle.
'May God grant you peace of Heaven until we meet once again on that Beautiful Shore.'
We miss you a lot, dear Aunty Lakshmi.

Christie Gunaratnam
Dutiful gentleman
Late Wijeratnam Christie Gunaratnam was born to orthodox Catholic parents on January 15, 1940 in Jaffna. Gunam was ailing for a few months and was treated by specialist doctors for a terminal illness in the best nursing homes in Colombo. His family and friends had hope of his recovery, but he suddenly developed a severe heart attack and died on May 10 at the age of 77 years.
God summons the virtues irrespective of their age. As a young lad in Jaffna, he became an altar server in his parish at Our Lady of Refuge (OLR) and also joined the church choir where he was recognized for his gifted voice.
He had his education at St. Patrick’s College, Jaffna and on completion of his secondary education, he moved to the upcountry for employment and worked as an accountant at the Scottish Tea and Lands Company of Ceylon Ltd.
He married Cathorine Nesamalar on August 22, 1973 and was blessed with two sons, Mervin and Malcolm and a daughter, Melonie. He was a devoted husband, an affectionate father and a loving grandfather, ever dutiful and concerned of their blossoms. He endeared his paternal responsibility with commitment and grace. He brought up his children in the fear of God, instilled noble qualities and gave priority for their education.
His priority in life was his faith in God. He believed in the power of prayers and requested many to pray for his cure. In fact, his life was not that rosy, but for his prayers, God blessed him. His faith sustained him in all his trials.
After his retirement, he settled in Colombo in January, 1996. He became the Parishioner of St. Lawrence’s Church, Wellawatte and was actively involved in church activities. Gunam has rendered yeoman services to his alma mater and to St Lawrence’s Church.
He was the Chief Editor for the annual SPC OBA Colombo souvenirs and also the news bulletin 'Bottle Sunshine.' He had great passion in producing caricatures and anecdotes and his articles were appreciated with much interest by all Global Patricians.
He was a prolific writer who enlivened his alma mater and parish. He had contributed volumes of tributes to Patricians and even to his brother Ganam. When the Patricians heard about his illness, they volunteered to help him financially for the services he rendered to our alma mater, which he acknowledged with gratitude. He was a unifying force among the Global Patricians. Gunam, a stalwart of St. Lawrence’s Church, Wellawatte, had served as the Editor of the church's quarterly bulletin 'ECHO.'
He was an active member of the church choir and was also an organizer of holy mass for the elderly and the sick during festive seasons and also conducted the 'way of the cross.' He was an ardent devotee of Divine Mercy of Jesus and never failed to attend the first friday novena and played an important role at Divine Mercy Feast celebrations.
He was also the Chairman of the 'Platinum Jubilee' souvenir magazine committee which produced very valuable data and photos of the Church history, which remains as treasure for parishioners. He served with utmost zeal and dedication in the parish and earned the admiration of the young and old. He was a faithful friend at times of need; many were privileged to have moved with him closely and had enjoyed his love and wisdom. He adhered to his convictions and never wilted under pressure. He was a man of principle and discipline, with sound character and charisma, with virtuous and adorable qualities.
As a choir member of Our Lady of Refuge in Jaffna, he earned a name for his golden voice. He sang the hymn 'Addaikallame' with his stentorian voice, bringing in heavenly atmosphere. He was a most lovable personality, gifted to entertain with witty jokes, lifting spirits up at parties.
Being a friend, I enjoyed his wisdom and kindness. Having fulfilled his obligations towards his family and relatives, he cherished his fruitful life on earth and entered into his glory to thank and praise the Lord Almighty in Heaven
His demise is an irreparable loss to his family and friends.
May the Merciful Lord of love receive him into the heavenly kingdom and grant him eternal bliss.
May he rest in peace.
“Sorrows tried him,
Faith sustained him,
Earth lost him,
Heaven gained him.”
S.B.David
Rukie Eheliyagoda
A mother greatly loved and cherished
I send this bouquet of words of love
To her heavenly abode above
Reached the milestone three score and thirty
Embraced life's hues gallantly
and cheerfully.
A Mother so gracious, never to find
So understanding, compassionate and kind
When troubled,
always found her by my side
Never to leave until my tears were dried.
The fabric of the family closely woven
Held firmly by a thread rare and golden
Teaching integrity, loyalty and generosity
Above all to love and fear God in humility.
A smile ever present; voice like a nightingale
A heart that quickly melted with each sad tale
Envy, hatred, vengeance found no place to dwell
In her soul, never to be claimed by hell.
“Anything worth doing is worth doing well and fast”
Her motto for life through the years past
Caressed by her love my days so happy and calm
an endless labour of love by a marvellous Mum.
God picked me out from the rest
and gifted me a Mother—
Better than the best

Bakeer Markar
Unique leader
On September 23, 1997, nearly two decades ago, the demise of Marhoom Al Haj Mohammed Abdul Bakeer Markar was a shock.
Popularly known as M.A. Bakeer Markar, he was a well-established criminal lawyer in the Kalutara Bar Association. Bakeer had a busy legal practice due to his honest and charismatic approach to clients.
He worked tirelessly on his cases. In addition to his legal prowess, Bakeer was a multi-linguist and great orator. This helped him to compete for the Beruwala Parliamentary seat in 1977.
He developed a flourishing political career and became the Chairman of the Beruwala Urban Council and later, became the first elected Member of Parliament for Beruwala. In 1977, he became Deputy Speaker and later, was elected as the Speaker in Parleament.
He was also appointed as a Cabinet Minister without portfolio and the Governor of the Southern Province. Even when the President and Prime Minister were out of the country, Bakeer served as the acting Head of State.
Born on May 12, 1917, in his ancestral hometown Beruwala, Bakeer was elected President of the Kalutara District Branch of the Ceylon Bar Association. Bakeer always showed his love, kindness and the loyalty not only to his friends and colleagues, but also to others.
He was a rare breed of politician, ever-willing to pass on his expertise and knowledge to the next generation.
I still remember a story told by my father, the late E.T. Kannangara, about this great son of Sri Lanka. My father, who was in the Health Department, said, he had a rare opportunity to talk with the late Bakeer Markar during one of his visits to Parliament with the former Health Minister Gamini Jayasooriya. The former Minister had introduced him to my father saying that Bakeer was unique as the last Speaker in the old Parliament and the first speaker in the new Parliament.
Educated at Sri Lanka’s popular Muslim school Zahira College, Maradana and Sri Lanka Law College, the late Bakeer was a strong supporter of the United National Party. He had no enemies. He loved all people irrespective of their caste, creed or religion. The huge gathering at his funeral spoke volumes of his public life. People from all walks of life paid their last tribute, genuinely pouring their tears. The gap he left is unbridgeable.
It is also my pleasure to speak few words about his son Imthiaz Bakeer Markar, whom I have a very close friendship with him. Whenever we meet, he never forgets to utter even few words about his father. Like his father, Imthiaz too always admires the peace among all people whether they are Sinhalese, Muslims, Burghers or Tamils.
Educated at Ananda College, Colombo, Imthiaz is very versatile in all three languages: Sinhala, English and Tamil. A lawyer by profession, Iimthiaz was the Minister of Media in 2002 under the Ranil Wickramasinghe Government .
Let me quote a few lines from the great bard William Shakespeare to put my pen down.
'Fear no more, thou thy worldly task hast done.’
Ananda Kannangara
