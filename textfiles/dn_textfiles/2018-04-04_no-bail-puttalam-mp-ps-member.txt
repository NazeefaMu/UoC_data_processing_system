No bail for Puttalam MP, PS member

A bail application filed by Puttalam district Parliamentarian Sanath Nishantha Perera and his brother Arachchikattuwa Pradeshiya Sabha member Jagath Perera, requesting for bail to be granted regarding an incident where they had violated bail conditions, was rejected by the Chilaw High Court, yesterday.
The court ordered Nishantha Perera and Jagath Perera to be produced in court as scheduled on May 24. The two brothers are charged over the assault of the Arachchikattuwa Divisional Secretary and the case is being heard at the Chilaw High Court.
Upon being granted bail in the case, a condition was set ordering the duo to appear before the Chilaw Police every Sunday and place their signatures.
However, the brothers are said to have violated the bail conditions and they were remanded on March 19.
