Traffic congestion costs over Rs. 1,000 million per day: Patali

A wastage of over Rs. 1,000 million occurs daily due to traffic congestion, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the redeveloped Kottawa-Pannipitiya Road financed by Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the government, the minister said there is no significant development in the transportation sector along with the economic development in the country. It contributes to traffic congestion. Vehicles used over 40 years are still being used. Buses to be used in cargo transport are being used for passenger transport, he said.
Minister Ranawaka said 20 days were wasted due to protests in Colombo during January and February.
He said new buses will be introduced to the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB). Trains will be operative centering Colombo and the suburbs with financial assistance from the Japanese Government.
He said over Rs. 360 million out of Rs. 371 million spent to redevelop the Kottawa-Pannipitiya Road was borne by JICA.
The minister said the Kelani Valley Railway line will be transformed into a double-track railway with the financial assistance from the Transport Ministry and the Asian Development Bank (ASD). A plan will be implemented to take action on illegal constructions prior to the establishment of the railway track, he said.
Ranawaka said Nawinna will be developed as a suburban town.
Referring to the registration of the medical graduates from the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM), the minister said education should not be used as a trading mechanism to increase profits.
