Zimbabwe seek to  end underdog tag

PAARL: Zimbabwe cricket coach Heath Streak said on Tuesday he wanted his players to play “winning cricket” when they meet South Africa in a one-off day-night Test next week.
“We'd rather lose trying to play a winning brand of cricket than just compete,” said Streak of a Test South Africa are expected to win comfortably.
“The main thing is belief and shaking off that underdog mentality we had,” he said in Paarl, the western Cape town where Zimbabwe begin a three-day warm-up match against a South African Invitation team on Wednesday.
Zimbabwe have played just ten Tests since they last met South Africa in Harare in August 2014, losing nine and drawing one.
“It's well documented how little Test cricket we play,” said Streak. “I think for us it's less about the type of cricket than about playing at international level.
