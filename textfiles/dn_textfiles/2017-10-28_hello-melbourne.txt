Hello, Melbourne

SriLankan Airlines will be flying to Melbourne, Australia from tomorrow after a lapse of many years. This will be a daily 8,360 Km flight that connects Colombo to Melbourne, which has the biggest Sri Lankan Diaspora in Australia. It will obviate the need to change planes at Singapore, which will cut travel time by at least three hours. The flight will also give two-way trade between the two countries a boost, adding totally new non-stop cargo capacity.
This literally marks a new departure for the loss-making SriLankan, which has terminated all long-haul flights including Paris and Frankfurt, apart from the daily flights to London Heathrow and Tokyo Narita. Adding Melbourne may not be enough to revive the fortunes of the flag carrier, now a member of the Oneworld Airline Alliance, but it will no doubt raise its profile globally.
SriLankan Airlines is obviously not in good health. SriLankan's operational losses widened to Rs. 28.14 billion (US$ 183.5 million) in 2016 from Rs. 12.62 billion (US$ 82 million) in 2015, but this has been attributed to the absorption of loss-making low-fare airline, Mihin Lanka, which was widely regarded as a vanity project of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. The airline’s operational losses for the first four months of 2017 are believed to hover around at Rs.9 billion (US$ 62 million). But financial losses are not the only aspect it has to worry about.
The previous Government’s opaque deal for eight all-new Airbus A350 aircraft is likely to be included in a wider European corruption probe targeting Airbus, which could also severely dent the airline’s reputation. The new Government cancelled part of the order by paying a penalty to the leasing company AerCap, but there are four more A350s on order. Efforts are now underway to cancel or renegotiate that as well. There is a school of thought that SriLankan should buy at least two of these new generation aircraft for Melbourne and other long-haul routes. The airline has however honoured a separate order for several Airbus A320 family NEO (New Engine Option) narrow-body aircraft, some of which have already been delivered and are in service.
According to latest reports, the Government will provide a credit lifeline of Rs.13 billion (US$ 86 million) through the two State banks to the struggling airline, which is still searching for the right international strategic partner after the unceremonious exit of Dubai-based Emirates several years ago. The US-based investment firm Texas Pacific Group (TPG) was in talks to acquire 49 percent of the carrier, but apparently pulled out after the true extent of the airline's debts was revealed. In August, a Japanese consortium of ANA (All Nippon Airways) and JAL (Japan Airlines, a fellow Oneworld airline) was reported to be interested in a potential deal, but no official information has been released so far. The authorities have been open to any other potential offers.
Finding a global strategic partner for SriLankan is essential, given that the Government cannot subsidise the airline forever. The Government’s financial resources are much needed elsewhere and an entity such as SriLankan should be a viable, profitable, self-sustaining one. President Maithripala Sirisena, who was in Qatar on a Stat Visit, has urged the authorities there to explore the possibility of fellow Oneworld airline Qatar Airways becoming a partner of SriLankan, which they had agreed to consider. The President has also instructed the National Economic Commission to re-initiate a dialogue with two major international airlines vis-à-vis SriLankan. All efforts must be made to find a strategic partner for the airline.
In the meantime, SriLankan must innovate to survive in the harsh global aviation environment. In this sense, Melbourne is a step in the right direction. There is no denying that linking Melbourne to Colombo is an important milestone for the airline. The next step is to get Australian airlines, especially QANTAS, (a Oneworld alliance partner) to fly to Colombo as per bilateral air agreements, perhaps from Sydney. Decades ago, QANTAS did operate a Perth-Colombo-London service, which was discontinued in favour of Singapore as the transit point.
The Melbourne-Colombo route has great potential because Colombo is an ideal gateway to India and Maldives and a midway point to Europe for those flying from Australia. SriLankan can market itself as an ideal stopover point for the latter sector. SriLankan hopes to tap into the NRI (Non Resident Indian) traffic from Australia via Colombo. SriLankan already is the biggest foreign carrier operating into India with over 100 flights a week to 11 destinations, which gives it a great leverage to market the nascent Melbourne route.
SriLankan must be poised to exploit the burgeoning Asia-Pacific travel market, which is expected to reach 7.8 billion passengers annually by 2036, according to the International Air Transport Association. Routes to, from and within Asia-Pacific will see an extra 2.1 billion annual passengers by 2036, for an overall market size of 3.5 billion. China, India and Indonesia, all destinations covered by SriLankan, will account for the bulk of the new passengers. Australasia too will be a very important growing market and SriLankan is right on target.
