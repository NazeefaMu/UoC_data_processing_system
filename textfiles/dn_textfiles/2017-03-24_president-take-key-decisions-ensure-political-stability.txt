President to take key decisions to ensure political stability

President Maithripala Sirisena is to take several key decisions in government to ensure political stability and make the government more stable, said State Minister of Finance Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena yesterday.
Abeywardena however refused to confirm whether the President’s decisions would involve a Cabinet reshuffle. Rumours of a possible Cabinet reshuffle however have been rife over the past few weeks.
When questioned why the President was taking two weeks to make a decision, the State Minister said; “When a political leader takes a decision, he needs to think of his own political stability prior to that. The decision also has to have certain public approval. Right now, the people are saying that there needs to be certain changes made”.
“Appropriate changes would be made at the right time,”he added.
In addition to changes within the government, the President, Abeywardena said, would also look into restructuring the SLFP. The process, he said would begin after this year’s May Day celebrations, “The President feels that more youth needs to be involved. The SLFP Youth Front has come up well over the past few years. On April 2 we will have the Youth Convention. There is a need for ‘clean politics’ now and we believe that the Youth can lead the way in that,”he said.
In the meantime, the government needs to find ways to stick together and the SLFP State Minister said
blame did not lie on either political party for the current instability and that there were mistakes on both sides.
One such mistake, he pointed out, was in the economic direction the country was headed in and according to Abeywardena, certain adjustments needed to be made in this area.
“In the recent past, our investments have been down, government revenue has slipped. The increases made to government salaries have also increased our expenditure.
"The frequent strikes have also made investors think that the country is politically volatile and not attractive for investments”, explained the State minister and added that all these issues would be dealt with by the President in the future.
“We need to change the direction in which the country is heading,”he added.
