More electric fences to battle jumbo invasion

Around 800 km of electric fences in addition to the present 500 km will be erected soon in the Anuradhapura District since wild elephants had destroyed nearly 150 villages close to jungle belt in the Nochchiyagama, Thalawa, Thirappane, Kahatagasdigiliya, Horowpothana, Padaviya, Palugaswewa, Palagala and Mahawilachchiya Divisional secretariat divisions.
The President has instructed the Wildlife Conservation Minister to erect additional fences of about 2,500 km very soon giving priority to remote areas more vulnerable to the wild elephants’ invasion.
Sources said the ministry has allocated about Rs. 6000 m for the project. More funds will be granted by the Treasury and Rs 600,000 will cost to construct one km of an electric fence.
The Civil Security Department will released 1,800 of its employees to work at the Wildlife Conservation Department and another 1,500 will be released to maintain and repair the electrified fences. Weta Samithi, (Fences Societies) will be set up to assist them in this regard.
Wildlife Conservation Minister Sarath Fonseka said he would take step to resolve the conflict very soon. He said the shortage of crackers would be resolved and more staff will be given to the Department.
Modern equipment including advanced weapons, and adequate transport facilities would be provided and public participation in the campaign would be encouraged, the Minister said.
