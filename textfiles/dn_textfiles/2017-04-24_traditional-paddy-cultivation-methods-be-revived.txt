Traditional paddy cultivation methods to be revived

Traditional paddy cultivation methods are to be revived in Sri Lanka. The farming community would be encouraged to grow more traditional high-quality strains of paddy under the programme, agriculture officials said.
According to Agriculture Ministry sources, over 3,000 acres of land had been brought under the plough through these methods. Neither chemical fertilisers nor pesticides are utilised in these cultivation activities. Paddy cultivators are made aware of the significance of using organic manure and compost, rather than chemical fertiliser.
Cultivation instructions, novel agriculture technology, and all other facilities in this regard, would also be provided to farmers by the Agriculture Ministry. It is targeted to bring about 100,000 acres of land in the country under paddy cultivation using traditional methods, soon, agriculture authorities added.
The enhancement of the production of high quality varieties of rice in the country would be the aim of these endeavours, agriculture project officials added.
