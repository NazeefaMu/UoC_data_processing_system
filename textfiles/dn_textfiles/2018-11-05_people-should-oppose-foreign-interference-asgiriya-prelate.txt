People should oppose foreign interference - Asgiriya Prelate

People should shelve political differences and join hands to oppose any move by the international community to impose sanctions on Sri Lanka at this moment, Most Ven. Warakagoda Gnanaratana Mahanayake Thera of the Asgiriya Chapter said.
“It is important for all parties including the UNP to oppose any such move to impose sanctions,” the Asgiriya Prelate said.
The Asgiriya Prelate made this observation when UNP Parliamentarians Lakshman Kiriella, Patali Champika Ranawaka, Ravi Karunanayake and J.C. Alawatuwala called on him at his temple in Kandy and received his blessings yesterday.
The Prelate said the Maha Sangha expected the present crisis to be resolved through discussions and negotiations because foreign countries would unnecessarily intervene if there was bloodshed in the country.
Lekakadhikari of the Asgiriya chapter Ven. Medagama Dhammananda Thera said that if there is international pressure both parties should join hands to face it.
Parliamentarian Lakshman Kiriella said all problems could be resolved if Parliament was reconvened.
Parliament should be given the option to decide as to who should be the Prime Minister. He said the International community is eagerly watching events in Sri Lanka to see as to who the Prime Minister is and who are members of the Cabinet.
The group later called on the Malwatte Prelate too and received his blessings. Parliamentarians Daya Gamage, Gamini Jayawickrama Perera, Ranjith Maddumabandara, Lucky Jayawardena and Ranjith Aluvihare were also present.
