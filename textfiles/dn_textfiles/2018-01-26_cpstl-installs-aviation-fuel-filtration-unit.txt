CPSTL installs aviation  fuel filtration unit

The Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminals (CPSTL) has installed the aviation fuel filtration unit which has neglected for 17 years, within short period of time.
CPC and CPSTL Chairman Dhammika Ranatunga stated that according to the Joint Inspection Group (JIG) reports, Sri Lanka has achieved ‘Good’ position in aviation fuel supply and they will be able to rise to “Excellent’ with this project.
The joint Inspection Group is an internationally accepted institution, which inspects standard methods and quality tests of pumping aviation fuel. The JIG had recommended the requirement of aviation fuel filtration unit in Sri Lanka.
Following the recommendation, documentation was initiated in June, 2017. Chairman Dhammika Ranatunga said they will be able to save between USD 2 to 300,000 from one vessel of aviation fuel.
“There was no aviation fuel filtration unit to pump fuel into train tanks in Kolonnawa. The CPSTL had to state in the documents about the unavailability of an aviation fuel filtration unit when they prepared specifications. Following this, we had to import aviation fuel at a higher price because suppliers had offered higher bids to supply aviation fuel. We do not further require to import aviation fuel for higher prices now.
“We will be able to call competitive prices to import aviation fuel, now. It saves US Dollars 300,000 on one vessel of aviation fuel. We would be able to confirm the quality of the aviation fuel and obtain huge monetary profits from this venture,” Chairman Dhammika Ranatunga said.
The unit was constructed by CPSTL engineers and they did complete it a few days before the scheduled period.
Parallel to this unit, two pumps with the capacity of 136 Cubic Meter per hour were installed.
CPSTL said they will be able to speed up the filling than they did earlier because of the new pumps.
