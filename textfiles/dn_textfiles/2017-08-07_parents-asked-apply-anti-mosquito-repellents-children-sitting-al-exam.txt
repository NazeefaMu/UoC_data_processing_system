Parents asked to apply anti-mosquito repellents on children sitting for A/L exam

Commissioner General of Examinations W.M.N.J. Pushpakumara said all parents should apply anti-mosquito ointments to their children who sit for the GCE (A/L) Examination-2017.
The Examination will commence on August 8.
Every step must be taken by the parents to protect their children from dengue mosquitoes as nearly 320 people have died of dengue by now, he said.
Health Ministry will deploy 1,800 PHIs to inspect examination centres to see whether they are free from mosquito-breeding grounds, a senior DMO in Kurunegala said.
