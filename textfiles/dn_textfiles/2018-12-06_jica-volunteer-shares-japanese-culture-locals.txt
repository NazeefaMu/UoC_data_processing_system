JICA volunteer shares Japanese culture with locals

Japan International Co-operation Agency (JICA) volunteer M. Sakase gave the Sri Lankans she works with a taste of Japanese culture, at the Galigamuwa MOH office last week.
Sakase who was accompanied by 14 other Japanese volunteers demonstrated the Japanese art of Origami and the use of chopsticks for eating.
The JICA group also entertained the gathering to a Japanese song and made a Japanese delicacy called Okonomi Yaki for the Sri Lankans.
Among those who attended the event were Galigamuwa MOH Dr. N.M.D.B. Nayakaratne, Dr. Tharanga Egalla, PHI Anoma Jayantha Pieris and other health staff attached to the MOH office.
Sakase who spoke in Sinhala, organised the event herself and made the invitation cards in the Sinhala language.
Speaking on project planning, she said, “A proper plan is a prerequisite to achieve an objective. You need time to execute such a plan. First, dissect the plan into separate sections and move forward with each section leaving out the difficult ones. There will be another day when you will be able to implement the remaining sections and believe that you will fulfil your objective completely some day.”
Miss Sakase said her stay in Sri Lanka had been very satisfying and considered Sri Lankans a friendly people.
She said her country was also in a state of destabilisation after the Second World War. But the Japanese people moved forward courageously and rebuilt their country to make it a developed nation.
