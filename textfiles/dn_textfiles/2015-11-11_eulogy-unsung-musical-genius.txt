Eulogy to an unsung musical genius

“Blow, blow thou winter wind Thou art not so unkind As man’s ingratitude...”
-William Shakespeare (1564 – 1616)
In the bewilderingly commercialized global culture of our day, it is not at all surprising to come upon at time, an instance of a bar of high classical music being utilized to promote a tube of toothpaste. Equally a choice excerpt of a pristine musical composition could very well be deployed to hype the tantalizing whiff of a brand of perfume!
This crazed daze and haze of relentless scuffle and sharply competitive of forays to grab the mass mind, spill out overwhelmingly into a headlong torrent, when some societies find themselves in an all - pervading poll-frenzy.
In that kind of chaotic, frantic and delirious communications disarray, perennial spiritual and human values are quite likely to be overshadowed by instant, ephemeral and depressingly narrow impulses. Petty priorities subdue creative achievements that have the potentiality to prove to be of lasting greatness. The memory of exceptionally talented men and women of unparalleled genius pathetically recede into a limbo of overpowering oblivion from where, many such great personalities have only a very slim chance of emerging once again into the limelight of public attention.
A wide-spread social malaise in Sri Lanka is the extensively prevalent predilection to cynically neglect and disregard those personalities of undoubted national and human stature, who so significantly matter to the country. Once they are gone, in a sudden spurt of seemingly high concern, their last rites are ceremonially conducted- at times, with the patronage of the State.
That of course is that.
But, it is salutary and heart-warming indeed, to note, that we still have in this country rare individuals who are fully committed to the idea of remembering those who are worthy of our deference, Adoration and Lasting memory!
The Author of this Work, Veteran Writer and experienced managerial administrator Piyasena Wickramage who focuses upon the late Sarath Dasanayaka, has proved over and over again, that he is profoundly moved by the neglect, that some men and women of genius of our land are allowed to suffer! As a national and human responsibility he has imposed upon himself, Author Piyasena Wickramage, has brought out works on forgotten personalities and also on important social eras that have escaped the attention of the mass memory.
In a recent well-researched tome. Writer Piyasena Wickramage chronicled the intriguing history of the Early Days of Sri Lankan Cinema. It is structurally akin to an absorbing Folk Record, setting down the informal history of the initial decades of our cinema.
In his current effort Writer Piyasena Wickramage, provides a detailed account of the substantial contribution made by late Musical Genius in the Film Music. Author Piyasena Wickramage performs an incredibly noteworthy service, by establishing the multi-pronged services rendered to Film Music in Sri Lanka, without earning the due encomium for such a massive utilization of phenomenal musical talent. Maestro Sarath Dasanayaka’s blazing contribution in bringing about a harmonious fusion between the Northern Indian Classical Musical theories and the folk rhythms indigenous to Sri Lanka is amply presented by Author Piyasena Wickramage.
Although film-music is presently, an integral element in world cinema, the Film Medium originally came into being as silent visual narration. In the early days at times, a group of musicians performed as an accompaniment to the silent film.
Officially, sound was integrated into cinema in 1927, with Warner Brothers “The Jazz Singer” in which Al Jolson figured. In Sri Lanka a significant film music tradition was inaugurated by musically erudite Sarath Dasanayaka. As Author Piyasena Wickramage indicates providing all the essential evidence, the distinguished achievement of Sarath Dasanayaka, was not at all adequately recognized and adored-due (as this Author states) to Sarath’s indomitable attitude of independence, which prevented him seeking partisan patronage.
In terms of the moving biographical details, presented by the Author, Sarath’s life was not quite a bed of roses. Nor, was it an uninterrupted song of rapture and glee.
Sarath met the ups-and-downs of life with a steady stoic adroitness. Music was the be-all and end-all of his life. He never compromised his faith to the music he committed himself to, as a life long ritual. Author Piyasena Wickramage addresses the conscience of out nation to enquire, Why as an, exceptional community of compassionate clear-sightedness, upholding the human virtue of gratitude, we fail our great personalities.
