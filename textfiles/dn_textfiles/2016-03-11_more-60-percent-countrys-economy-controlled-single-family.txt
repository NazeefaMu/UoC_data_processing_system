'More than 60 percent of country's economy controlled by single family'

 
More than 60 percent of the country's economy during the last regime was controlled by a single family lacking a long-sighted vision nor proper plans, said Irrigation Minister Vijith Vijayamuni Zoysa. Accordingly, many decisions in regard to the country's economic management were taken by the family at a mini cabinet without the consent of other ministers. He said so addressing the weekly media briefing held at the Sri Lanka Freedom Party Headquarters, yesterday.
He said that due to such domination, several measures which caused severe damages to the economy were taken. For example, the Mihinlanka, the signing of the hedging agreement, construction of several mega projects and many more. As an outcome of such narrow sighted decisions by the mini cabinet, the country had to settle billions of debts. However, out of which amount, Rs. 100 billion was settled by the present government during the previous year and a sum of Rs. 1,042 is still to be settled.
"Due to narrow sighted decisions taken by the previous government, the economy was suffering from malnutrition," the minister said.
The minister speaking on the ongoing reorganization process of the SLFP, said the SLFP would be converted into a strong party with the aim of transforming the SLFP to its past glory, under the guidance of its chairman President Maithripala Sirisena. Due this, all existing leaders of local government institutions would be permitted to contest the forthcoming LG polls under the UPFA banner.
He said the country's farmers would be managed and directed by the Irrigation Department, where paddy farmers would be informed of the dates of issuing water and other details relating to cultivations.
Petroleum Resources Development Minister Chandima Weerakkodi addressing the media said a sum of Rs. 350 billion had to be settled by the ministry.
"The Ministry should pay Rs 1.2 billion monthly as interest for loans obtained by the ministry during the tenure of the previous regime. An amount of Rs. 365 billion of loans should be settled," he added.
Meanwhile, the ministry would bring around US $ 33 million projects to the country in due course. Under this, the Petroleum Corporation would enter the field of manufacturing lubrication oil again, by launching a project at a cost of US $13 million.
Instead of the outdated petroleum oil purchasing system, a new transparency system would be introduced.
Higher Education State Minister Mohan Lal Grero, said the country's standard of higher education had presently deteriorated, while several Asian countries have overtaken us in this aspect.
However, moves are being taken to improve the standard of higher education, while increasing the number of university entrants, he said.
