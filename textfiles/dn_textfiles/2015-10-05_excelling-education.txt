Excelling education

The British High Commissioner has congratulated Informatics Institute of Technology (IIT) for its contribution to local private higher education in Sri Lanka over the past 25 years. The achievement was recognized at an event held at the High Commissioner’s residence last night, attended by Professor Geoffrey Petts, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Westminster, along with key partners from academia and industry who have supported the institute over the years and a selection of their distinguished alumni.
Congratulating IIT on 25 years of work in the education sector, British High Commissioner to Sri Lanka James Dauris said: “I am delighted to recognize the valuable contribution that IIT has made to the education industry in Sri Lanka. IIT have been a pioneer provider of British university education in Sri Lanka for 25 years, producing over 3,000 Sri Lankan graduates. UK education standards are highly valued around the world, and partnerships such as these have helped improve education in both our countries. IIT’s work in Sri Lanka has enabled thousands of Sri Lankans to gain the qualifications they need to launch successful careers. I applaud their efforts and wish their partnership with the University of Westminster continued success.”
In response, the Founder and Chairman of IIT Dr.Gamini Wickramasinghe said: “We are very pleased to have received this appreciation and endorsement from the British High Commission. We work hard to apply the best practices and measures in delivering quality education to our students. Getting to where we have got to has been made possible through the participation of all employees at every level of the organization. We will continue to persevere to improve and maintain the highest quality in the services we provide and the causes we deliver to our students.”
Guest of honour Professor Geoffrey Petts, Vice-Chancellor and President of the University of Westminster added:
“IIT students continue to secure international recognition for their outstanding achievements in the development of new software tools, often exceeding the achievements of graduates of other universities. The notable achievements of IIT students in 2015 include their winning for the second year running in the Microsoft Imagine Cup, which challenges students to find creative solutions to today’s challenges in the categories of World Citizenship, Innovation and Games. The Google Summer of Code competitions also secured three winners for IIT in the development of free open source software,”
IIT’s success is seen in over 3000 graduates practising globally within the industry and beyond. The IIT campus is currently affiliated to the University of Westminster UK which is an acclaimed modern university that has won the prestigious Queen’s Award for Enterprise for two years consecutively. In the past, IIT has also delivered internal degree programmes of Manchester Metropolitan University and Keele University.
