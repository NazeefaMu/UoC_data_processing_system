SLT holds industry forum on cyber security

SLT in collaboration with SL CERT held The Cyber Security Forum, with the aim of increasing awareness and helping CIOs and Heads of IT departments in organizations to improve online security and prevent cyber crimes.
The Forum took place at the Hilton Colombo Residences with the participation of a large number of CIOs, cyber security and IT security experts in Sri Lanka.
Both the organizations aim to work together towards the developmental goals of the country, providing assurance for next generation cyber security services.
The forum addressed latest threats being experienced globally, protecting critical national infrastructure, and encouraging administration’s participation in the discussions of national level cyber security initiatives.
During the forum, the resource person, Professor Abhaya Induruwa addressing the gathering said, “Cybersecurity was previously an issue for the back room. Now, it’s made its way to the boardroom and the Situation Room.”
“Cyber threats are growing in intensity and scale. We’ve seen significant breaches at government agencies and in private businesses, including leading global financial institutions and large enterprises,” added Prof. Induruwa. It is important that both the public and private sector should come together in protecting critical assets with confidence and trust, which will help manage risks that are known and get ahead of those not known. The timely collaboration of Sri Lanka Telecom and SL CERT is a commendable effort in this light. At present, the focus should be on two primary areas: the concept of enhanced public-private information sharing and developing standards and crafting a cyber security framework for Sri Lanka that addresses risks across government and industry and to do so quickly. Simultaneously, an effective cyber security framework should enable overcoming barriers in continuing economic growth, while creating an environment that protects and nurtures innovation.
The latest unprecedented ransomware attack that has affected organizations in over 150 countries highlights the exploding threat landscape that is faced today. Both the public sector and private sector, as well as economic enablers should take initiatives to secure their digital enterprises from cyber threats.
With cyber crimes continuing to escalate, new approaches to digital risks should be assessed and mitigated by any organization. Professor Induruwa has contributed to Sri Lanka’s ICT industry by pioneering ICT education and playing a pivotal role in the deployment of Internet in Sri Lanka. He is the founder of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Moratuwa in 1985, the first of its kind in a Sri Lankan state university.
In recognition of his pioneering efforts in bringing the Internet to Sri Lanka, Professor Induruwa was inducted to the Internet Hall of Fame 2014, an honorary lifetime achievement award administered by the Internet Society. Locally, he was honoured by the Internet Society Sri Lanka Chapter with the Internet Pioneers Award at the celebration of 20 years of Internet in Sri Lanka in June 2015. He currently serves as the Director of the Centre for Cybercrime and Security Innovation at the Canterbury Christ Church University in the United Kingdom.
