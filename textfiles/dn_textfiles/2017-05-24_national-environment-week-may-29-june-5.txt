National Environment Week from May 29-June 5

The government has declared the National Environment Week from May 29 to June 05 to mark the 44th World Environment Day falls on June 5.
Sri Lanka will mark 'World Environment Day 2017' with a National Ceremony at the Vernon Fernando grounds in Kalutara on June 5 at 9.00 am with the participation of President Maithripala Sirisena as the Chief Guest. This year's theme for World Environment Day is “Connecting People to Nature”.
Mahaweli Development and Environment Deputy Minister Anuradha Jayaratne said President Maithripala Sirisena as the Mahaweli Development and Environment Minister has obtained the Cabinet approval last year to mark June 5 as the World Environment Day and also to mark the prior week as a National Environment Week to celebrate the Worlds Environment Day in Sri Lanka.
"We have organised various programmes this year to protect the environment in Sri Lanka on June 5.
Accordingly, environment awareness day is held on May 29, environment cleaning day on May 30, waste management day on May 31, tree planting day on June 1, water and water catchment area conservation day on June 2, bio diversity day on June 3, sustainable land management day on June 4 and the Worlds Environment Day on June 5," the Deputy Minister said.
Addressing the media briefing held in Colombo yesterday, he said several programmes targeting school children and the general public have been organised throughout the country to raise awareness about environment protection.
The Ministry in collaboration with all government institutions will implement environment conservation programmes including tree planting campaigns, waste management programmes and cleaning programmes.
Development of rural schools and awareness programmes for school children will also be conducted.
Secretary to the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment Udaya R. Seneviratne said the use of limited natural resources in an unsuitable manner to maintain an increasing global population has led to climate changes, global warming, sol erosion and destruction of water detention areas.
"As a part of World Environment Day, we have organised a number of programmes to ensure the pristine environment for the future generation," he said.
