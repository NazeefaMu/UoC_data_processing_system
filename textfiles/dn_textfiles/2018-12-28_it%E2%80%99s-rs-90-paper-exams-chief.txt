It’s Rs 90 a paper - Exams Chief

Chief Secretary of the Ceylon Teacher’s Union Joseph Stalin said the Examinations Department had reduced payment for OL exam markers.
He said the payment report issued by the Examinations Department had mentioned that the payment allocated made for marking the Ordinary Level Mathematics paper had been reduced to Rs.70. Responding to the CTU, Commissioner General of Examinations Sanath Pujitha said that it was a printing error.
Issuing a new payment report, the Examinations Commissioner General said Mathematics papers have been marked at Rs.90 a paper.
