The Old Joes Choir brings ‘This is My Story’

Join The Old Joes Choir, Sri Lanka’s award winning all male choir as they celebrate 20 years of Choral Harmony with an evening of thanksgiving and praise on the Feast of St Joseph on March 19 at 6.30pm at the Chapel of St Joseph’s College, Colombo. The group has made the event free to attend as they wish to tell everyone their unique ‘Story’ which has led them to where they are today.
The event is the first of a series of musical events which are planned as the Choir marks 20 years of singing, the first major choir in the island to do so, having warmed up their vocal chords in 1997.
The group will perform a range of choral pieces including Classical music as well as a few Barbershop arrangements. The event is set to feature a multitude of experienced and newer choristers and instrumentalists who have graced the stage as ‘Old Joes’
The Old Joes’ choir consists of Past Pupils of St. Joseph’s College Colombo, who are united in their passion music and the Blue and White who have graced the stage since 1997.
The group has produced critically acclaimed concerts including Preghiera (1997), Evolution (2002-2007), Timeless Echoes (2008), Amore (2010), Open Mic (2013) and That’s Christmas to me (2015). The choir reached its greatest accomplishment to date by winning the Barbershop Category and being the first runner up in the Sacred Music Category at the 8th World Choir Games 2014 held in Riga, Latvia.
For more information, visit the group on their facebook page www.facebook.com/TheOldJoesChoir and ensure that you don’t miss out on what is shaping up to be an evening filled with thanksgiving and praise as the Boys from Darley Road add their unique sound on a wide array of choral melodies.
