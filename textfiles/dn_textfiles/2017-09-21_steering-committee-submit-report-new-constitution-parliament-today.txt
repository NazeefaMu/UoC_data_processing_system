Steering Committee to submit report on new Constitution to Parliament today

The Steering Committee appointed by the Constitutional Council to draw up a new Constitution, will submit its report to Parliament today, Attorney-at-Law Lal Wijenaike, Chairman of the Committee on Public Recommendations regarding Constitutional Reforms said.
This report included recommendations made by six subcommittees appointed by the Steering Committee.
People's representatives as well as the public will have an opportunity to express their views about this report too, he said. The report would be released to the public for their observations after it was discussed in Parliament.
Wijenaike was addressing a press conference held at the Central Provincial Council Complex in Kandy recently.
Referring to an allegation made by Parliamentarian Keheliya Rambukwella that the government was trying to foist a Constitution framed according to proposals made by the US, Wijenaike said it was a travesty of the truth aimed to gain petty political gain.
In fact, Parliamentarian Bandula Gunawardene, who functioned as Chairman of the Finance Sub Committee to hear recommendations too, had forwarded a report in this connection and Keheliya Rambukwella could easily ask Gunawardene as to whether it included recommendations made by the US.
