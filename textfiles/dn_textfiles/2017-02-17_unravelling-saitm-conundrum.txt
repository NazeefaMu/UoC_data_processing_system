Unravelling SAITM conundrum

The medical degree of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) continues to be in the centre of controversy. The recent decision of the Court of Appeal legalizing the degree has given a new impetus to the agitation against SAITM as well as encouraged the SAITM authorities to aggressively pursue their own agenda.
Though several key ministers are vociferously stating that the issue is finally settled with the Court verdict and nothing further could be done by any one or any organisation, the agitation is unlikely to wane off.
It seems that these gentlemen ministers have overlooked several salient factors in the present situation. First, the Court could and would decide only on matters placed before it. There are many aspects that were not presented to the Court. Second, the court decision was based on the decision of the then Minister of Higher education S B Dissanayake. That was a political decision.
SAITM issue remains a political one and hence a court verdict cannot be the ultima thule in such instances. This is a factor that the Government could ignore at its own peril.
Clearly different persons or groups would have different opinions on the issue and they would act according to them. However, it would be unwise to come to conclusions without looking at or analyzing the issue in all its aspects. A satisfactory solution to the problem could be found only on the basis of such a comprehensive analysis.
There are several arguments against recognizing the SAITM medical degree. The broadest objection is that it should be opposed as it is a private institution that is transgressing an educational sector that is the exclusive prerogative of the State. It is presumed to be a first step in totally privatizing education, at least higher education.
Private sector education
Education today is largely in private hands. The private sector has encroached upon primary education in a big way. At first it came surreptitiously through the BOI. Then it became bolder with the passage of time. It is considerable in the Secondary education sphere too. The sad fact is that there is hardly any regulatory action by the State to maintain quality and content of education.
Pre-primary education is almost completely private and regulation is non-existent. Strangely this issue has not caught the attention of any educationist yet. Another matter of concern is the increasing cost of “free education” in public schools. Parents have to spend considerable sums to maintain school facilities as well as to buy stationery, supplementary reading materials and other requisites of children attending school. These expenses have increased so much that one could hardly speak of any free education at all.
In the tertiary education sphere private sector education is considerable. What is new in the SAITM issue is that it is the pioneer in private medical education. If private education is found in all other disciplines except medicine it would be illogical to oppose it simply based on its ownership.
The case for private higher education is based on the following indisputable factors: State Universities could absorb only about 15 percent of students that qualify for University admissions at the GCE (A/L) Examination. This number cannot be rapidly increased due to financial constraints due to the under-developed nature of our economy. On the other hand, rapid development of human resources is necessary for economic development especially in view of the knowledge society that needs to be built.
Regulatory authority for tertiary education
However much private education spreads the Government cannot wash its hands off its responsibility for the education of its citizens. It has to ensure minimum standards of quality and content of education taking into consideration the development needs of the country and the welfare of its subjects. In the absence of proper regulation private education providers would be interested solely in making the biggest profit in the shortest time with minimum content. Hence, it is absolutely necessary to establish a regulatory authority for tertiary education since the UGC is only for State Universities.
Though private or private-public participatory educational institutions could exist the government should ensure that resources of State Universities are not depleted or diverted to private institutions. What has happened to certain State health sector institutions should not happen in the University system. If private Universities attract material and human resources of the State University system then it would ruin the latter. Hence, the protest of the University students cannot be dismissed as a handiwork of subversive politicians.
The main issue concerning SAITM Is regarding the quality of education and training imparted. This is a technical issue for which a technical solution is possible. The GMOA as well as medical consultants oppose the recognition of the SAITM medical degree on the ground that it is not up to the required standard. This is a grave allegation which should not be dismissed offhand. The call for mandatory approval by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) is legitimate and should be obliged with. Also revision of legislation to improve the powers and actions of the SLMC is also imperative.
As stated earlier the Court decision was based on the decision of former Minister S B Dissanayake (No wonder he is so vociferous in its defence). It is a moot point whether he had sufficient grounds to arrive at that decision.
SAITM students
Instead of cooperating with the SLMC, authorities at SAITM also took a confrontational attitude, perhaps encouraged by the then government in power. It seems that by its own experience they have found it easier to lobby and win over ministers to the SLMC to their point of view. That may be why they kept on admitting two batches of students per year and do so even today, while the future of their medical graduates remains uncertain.
This issue, I repeat, would not wane off. Already a broad front of the working population and the student community has been formed to carry on the agitation. Leaders of the Consensus Government could not and should not remain as naïve political babies ignoring the oft repeated truism that in politics there are no permanent friends or permanent enemies.
This is not a problem of Himalayan proportions requiring a Herculean effort to find a solution. It is a simple problem requiring a simple solution. The immediate problem could be solved through negotiations in which all stakeholders take part. The President should take the initiative as promised. Those involved in putting their foot in the mouth in public over this issue should be kept as far away as possible from the negotiating process.
Finally there is also a human dimension to the issue. SAITM students awaiting the recognition of their medical degree should be given opportunities to perfect their training through an interim process with the assistance of the Government, the SLMC and the GMOA. Admissions to the SAITM medical course should be temporarily stopped till a final solution is found to the problem.
