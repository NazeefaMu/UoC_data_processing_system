Abans Homes In Style offers elegant, furniture at Colombo City Centre

Abans Homes In Style, the furniture arm of Abans PLC, launched their flagship concept store at the Colombo City Centre Mall on September 19, 2018.
The store was opened by Aban Pestonjee, Chairperson, Abans Group. Dignitaries from Abans PLC and Colombo City Centre were also present at the launch.
“The predominant focus of Abans Homes In Style is to provide a furniture approach that marries the values of style and health. I am pleased to say that, through our new chic, toxic-free furniture collection at the Abans Homes In Style Flagship Store, we will be offering consumers the opportunity to apply this approach to their homes,” said Mrs. Pestonjee, commenting on the significance of the store opening.
Being Sri Lanka’s first home concept store, Abans Homes In Style offers a transformative immersive experience that completely reinvents furniture shopping. This is expressed through the design and layout of the store, which reinforces the furniture brand’s twin attributes of exclusivity and customization.
The store is segmented into conceptualized living, dining, and bedroom spaces, exhibiting the furniture sets not in the usual product display form, but as works of art. The geometric detailing on the storefront façade and inner space as well as the interplay between the soft-focus lighting and reflective high-gloss materials work in symbiotic cohesion to draw attention to the exclusive designs showcased by each furniture piece.
The Abans Homes In Style Flagship Store also includes a design centre, where clients can consult with the brand’s own interior designer on a style concept that will best suit their home.
The team behind the design and development of the store’s interiors is Balmond Studio, an international research-led practice of architects, designers, artists, and theoreticians run by the world’s leading thinker on form and structure Cecil Balmond.
Abans Homes In Style aims to provide consumers with an ergonomicand customizable approach to a stylish home. Each furniture piece offered by the brandexpresses three main attributes – exclusive style, luxurious comfort, and enhanced safety.
Abans Homes In Style is also the country’s first home lifestyle brand to offer a range of toxic-free furniture that feature hypoallergenic fabrics and upholstery as well as sustainably sourced, chemical-free solid wood. Further, Abans Homes In Style presently distributes living room sets, dining room sets, bedroom sets, and accessories from world-renowned European brands.
