‘Enterprise Sri Lanka - Thurunu Diriya’:
Galle leads in disbursements

The Galle district leads the Bank of Ceylon’s ‘Thurunu Diriya’ loan disbursements in the island by providing loans to nine young entrepreneurs in Galle.
This was stated in the weekly progress report on implementing the ‘Thurunu Diriya’ loan scheme, released by the Bank of Ceylon on August 8.
The provincial level loan disbursements were led by the Western province by disbursing loans to 13 young entrepreneurs in the province. The report also reveals that there is a 40 percent progress compared to the previous week in the provincial-level progress of implementing the ‘Thurunu Diriya’ loan scheme.
The interest among young entrepreneurs island-wide towards ‘Enterprise Sri Lanka- Thurunu Diriya’ programme is increasing day by day, the Policy Development Office of the Prime Minister’s Office stated in a release.
“The commitment of the stakeholders towards the success of this programme should be highly appreciated and the commendable progress of this programme proves their commitment.”
The Bank of Ceylon in collaboration with the Policy Development Office (PDO) of the Prime Minister’s Office and the Central Programme Management Unit (CPMU) of the National Policies and Economic Affairs Ministry implemented the ‘Thurunu Diriya’ loan scheme with the objective of empowering young entrepreneurs.
It provides loans without a guarantor and collateral or with lenient guarantor conditions for small-scale young entrepreneurs under 35 years, who possess a degree or a recognized vocational certificate and were in the business for not less than three years.
