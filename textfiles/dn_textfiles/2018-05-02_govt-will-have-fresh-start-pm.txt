Govt. will have fresh start: PM

The Yahapalana government will march forward with a fresh program, supported by a newly appointed Cabinet despite unreasonable criticisms, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Premier was speaking at the ceremony to commemorate the 25th Death Anniversary of the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa, yesterday morning.
Premier Wickremesinghe, pointing out that the Yahapalana government should take the late President Premadasa’s vision and mission as an example, said that it is their duty to continue the magnanimous industrial, housing and social welfare projects initiated by the late President and UNP head.
“There are a number of people who accuse us left and right. They blame us continuously. But they don’t come up with another way. If they are critical of the government, they should present us with a solid option. We have a plan. I am not denying the fact that we have our own shortcomings. Last February, the people of this country gave us a clear warning. They pointed out to us that we are slow in progress. They want us to keep our promises. So we are continuing with a fresh start,” Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
Reminiscing on the past, Premier Wickremesinghe said he worked closely with the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa when he was given the Minister of Industry portfolio.
“Then President Premadasa contacted me and requested to start a project establishing garment factories around the country. His plan was to empower the village community. Accordingly, factories were established in areas such as Biyagama and Katunayaka.
“He told me to establish those factories within a month’s time, when the investors were finalized. Whatever the issues relevant to the procedure, I was to inform him. Infrastructure issues were solved by him in two weeks. So we first established 100 garment factories. Then he wanted me to establish 100 more. Unfortunately, he did not live to witness all those factories. These factories provided numerous ways of income for people in rural areas.”
Premier Wickremesinghe pointed out that the Yahapalana government is also facing similar issues in providing infrastructure facilities when promoting industries in the country. “When we took over the government in 2015, no one trusted us. We couldn’t access the global export market. But then we were able to retrieve the GSP+ facility. We won over international investors. We will generate government jobs as well as private jobs. We will have to generate ways of income for the young generation in this country, just like the late President Premadasa,” he said.
