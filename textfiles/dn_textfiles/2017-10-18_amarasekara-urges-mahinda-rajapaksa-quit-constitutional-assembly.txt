Amarasekara urges Mahinda Rajapaksa  to quit Constitutional Assembly

Dr. Gunadasa Amarasekara urged Parliamentarian Mahinda Rajapaksa to get away from the process of preparing a new constitution since it would be a severe threat to the country’s territorial integrity.
He was addressing the media yesterday at the Federation of National Organisations (FNO) office, Rajagiriya.
On behalf of the FNO, Amarasekara urged Rajapaksa to quit the Constitutional Assembly.
Journalist Mohan Samaranayaka addressing the media said the unitary government was not mandated by people to prepare a new constitution. He said the on-going constitution making process was illegal.
“The prepared draft for the new constitution contains harmful clauses to the territorial integrity and the unitary status of the country. It was prepared to carry out the hidden agenda of international forces including certain western countries and organisations Once the new constitution is implemented, disputes would arise among ethnicities in the country. Therefore, the entire process should be given up,” he said.
He said that no one should be allowed to destroy peace by bringing a new constitution.
“No one asks for a new constitution, but the Government is attempting to introduce a constitution by force. It is clear that certain segments want to obtain federal status through bringing the constitution,” he said.
He said the ‘Constitutional time bomb’ should be defused to protect the country from division.
