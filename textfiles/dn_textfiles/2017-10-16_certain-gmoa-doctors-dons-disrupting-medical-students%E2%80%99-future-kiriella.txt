Certain GMOA doctors, dons disrupting medical students’ future: Kiriella

“A few doctors holding office in the GMOA have teamed up with certain university dons to disrupt the future of medical students by inducing them to protest and demonstrate. Their parents should understand this reality,” Leader of the House and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
He was addressing a press conference held at his Kandy Heerassagala residence on October 15.
“These groups are ruining the future prospects of medical students and the negative repercussions of the sinful act of these students and dons they will feel within the next few years,” he said.
Kiriella said the policy of the Government was to strengthen free education while stabilising private education because students passing the O/L should have the opportunity to pursue higher education within the country even by paying for it.
“These facilities were available in all countries and the GMOA and the striking students were under the misconception that education policy should be fashioned according to their behest,” he said.
The Minister said the court case over the SAITM was billed to be heard daily to a finish in November within three days. “The Government was prepared to go by the court verdict and act accordingly,” he said.
“Nearly 300 go abroad annually to obtain medical degrees and it cost the country nearly Rs. 7,000 billion in foreign exchange. The country would be able to save that amount by setting up a private medical college locally,” the Minister said.
He said the anti-SAITM campaign definitely had political overtones. Defeated political elements were taking cover under this campaign to build public opinion against the Government.
“The masses are completely aware of their underlying intentions because the SAITM was started during the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime,” the Minister said.
