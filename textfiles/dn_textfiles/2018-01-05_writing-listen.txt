Writing to listen

“The well known English folk story collector Henry Parker notes this point in his compilation of village folktales from Ceylon. Parker had been an avid listener to Sinhala folktales, while he was a colonial administrator, long before the advent of the radio listening came to be known in the local village set up. The contents of these features are interspersed by the brief discussions on the part of the invited and researched on each subject area that is covered. “
As a contributor to radio medium, I feel that the writing to radio has changed over the years. During the fifties and the sixties quite a number of books about writing as a career in broadcasting appeared both in English and in other languages all over the world. Perhaps this is reduced to the minimum as the interest in the subject area too has changed due to quite a number of reasons. During the fifties, as I remember we used to buy a weekly magazine titled as ‘The Listener’ published by the World Service of the BBC. This periodical carried quite a number of articles that came to be broadcast over the World Service of the BBC in London.
Later as the same articles also came to be printed in the form of books, which had a good sale in all parts of the world where there was an English readership. This trend was followed in Sri Lanka at the formative period as local broadcasting system, when one of the learned Sinhala journals came to be known as ‘Tarangani’. This periodical contained quite a number of Sinhala articles that were broadcast in the Sinhala channels of the day. They included radio play scripts, poems, short stories, translations and original features.
[SUBHEAD] Feature scripts
A few books appeared carrying the radio play scripts. One was written by the veteran radio play producer P Welikala and the other by Professor Ediriweera Sarachchandra.
The trend extended up to the publication of Sugathapala de Silva’s publication titled as Handa Naluva. This was in keeping with the well known English publication titled as ‘Right way to Write Radio Plays’ by the BBC writer cum producer of the sixties, Val Henry Gielgud. I recollected all these as I read the pages of a latest collection of Sinhala feature scripts written and compiled by two lecturers of Mass Communication Department of Kelaniya University.
These two lecturers, Saman Rajapaksa and Amali Utpala Nandasiri, had taken the writing of radio features as a learning and teaching project via the classroom creative communication exercises. On reading the printed scripts, I felt that the materials drawn are predominantly from the local folklore sources as a guide to the teaching that embraces the areas of traditional patterns of communicating public opinion formation, and development communication. The two scholarly writers had taken pains in the writing training at the broadcast production with a team of undergraduate fitted to the purpose.
Thus the feature scripts envelope quite a number of layers in folklore, religion and the changing aspects of literature. Teaching the basis of sound perception at what it could do to the audience is the underlying premise of the intention. Then it is followed by the variety of the subject selected. Out of the 14 feature scripts printed, a major portion is developed to the origins of certain customs, maneuvering, use of language at the sensitive areas of rites and rituals. The collection is titled aptly as ‘Iragala Vetena Yamaya’ (The phase when the sun sets) - perhaps taking a number of factors pertaining to the rural lifestyles. As recorded over the years, the folk stories have been passed down from the elders to the youngsters during the late evenings in specified places like the temple and tea kiosks.
The well known English folk story collector Henry Parker notes this point in his compilation of village folktales from Ceylon. Parker had been an avid listener to Sinhala folktales, while he was a colonial administrator, long before the advent of the radio listening came to be known in the local village set up. The contents of these features are interspersed by the brief discussions on the part of the invited and researched on each subject area that is covered.
Radio sound
As such, the discussion element is observed as an additional resource to the written script. This once again paves the way to the rediscovery of the use of radio sound broadcasting, a way of creative teaching.
Though not observed as a grave error on the part of broadcasting, it could be surmised that with the advent of the popularity of the FM channels, the writing for radio became obsolete and unwanted as there happened to be ‘chatterboxes’ as against the more prepared radio broadcasters who discerned what should be transmitted. This ongoing debate is well answered by this publication. What deserves the attention of both practicing broadcaster as well as the discriminated audience?
As media studies have now come to stay in the school curriculum, this publication could be gauged as a welcome variant to the available text prepared to help the student on the concept of ‘writing to sound medium’. Thus the effort on the part of the two lecturers in communication should be commended.
Frequent references
On writing these scripts, the two lecturers attempt to use a more colloquial and /or spoken dialect much suited to the ear than the eye.
There are frequent references to those who form the embedded material on the part of those who know rather than those who have bookish knowledge.
