Bangladesh win  second U19 ODI  by 8 runs (D/L)

Opener Navod Paranavithana’s well paced knock of 83 off 128 balls (7 fours) proved a vain effort as Bangladesh beat Sri Lanka by eight runs under the Duckworth/Lewis rain rule to win the second under 19 ODI played at the Rangiri Dambulla Stadium yesterday.
Winning the toss Sri Lanka ran up a score of 192-9 in a game reduced to 43 overs a side with Paranavithana contributing 83 and Avishka Tharindu 43.
Fast bowlers Shahin Alam (4/43) and Shoriful Islam (3/49) affected the main damage to the Lankan batting.
Bangladesh’s run chase was curtailed in the 21st over when rain ended play. At that stage they were 101-4 in 20.4 overs which according to the D/L rule they were ahead by eight runs.
Scores: Sri Lanka (U19) 192-9 in 43 overs (Navod Paranavithana 83, Nipun Dananjaya 23, Avishka Tharindu 43, Shoriful Islam 3/49, Shahin Alam 4/43, Maittunjoy Chowdhury 2/42)
Bangladesh (U19) 101-4 in 20.4 overs (Shamim Patwary 27 n.o., Akbar Ali 30 n.o., Ashen Daniel 2/15, Navod Paranavithana 2/31)
