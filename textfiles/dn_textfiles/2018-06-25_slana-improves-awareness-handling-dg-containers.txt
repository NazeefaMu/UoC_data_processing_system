SLANA improves awareness  of handling DG containers

SLANA (Sri Lanka Association of NVOCC Agents) which has taken a leading role in educating the industry in specialized areas of Sea Freight handling, conducted a seminar on May 24, 2018 at the NDB Auditorium on “Handling of Dangerous Goods”.
With the increased number of accidents on ships and at ports, due to the lack of awareness in handling of dangerous goods, it was a most opportune time to conduct such a program. Specialists from the industry, with real time experience in managing DG containers and also handling crises were selected as panelists for the seminar.
The Associate Dean of the Faculty of Management at CINEC Campus Dr. Lalith Edirisinghe, elaborated on “What is DG cargo “, The IMO IMDG Classification, The perspectives of Exporters, Freight Forwarders and Shipping Lines.
Rohana Thudugala from the Sri Lanka Ports Authority, gave an insight from the Terminal operators perspective, where DG containers are received and stevedored to the ships. He also explained the the duties of the Safety office at port.
This gave everyone at attendance a very thorough understanding of the importance of the Dangerous Goods operation and the ramifications if not followed closely.
Master Mariner Capt. Peshala Medagama shared his diverse experiences at sea in handling DG cargo when on board the vessels, the real risk of IMDG from a Ship Captain’s perspective.
This gave the audience a more practical and a “real time” understanding of the DG operation apart from the theoretical aspect itself. It was also very educating to know how different countries operate when it comes to the handling of DG cargo and how we as Sri Lanka can emulate and improve as a whole to be more efficient and minimize risks.
There was an active discussion afterwards between the panellists and the audience where several unclear areas were brought up and answered through a very fruitful Q & A session.
At the inception, the Chairman of SLANA Captain A V Rajendra said that SLANA was formed in 2016 in order to protect the interest of the agents who represent Non Vessel Operating Container Carriers (NVOCC) and also to develop more opportunities for NVOCCs, the Port of Colombo, Exporters and Importers, by expanding the trade lanes and the frequency of sailing to / from Colombo. He also elaborated on the commitment of SLANA to educate and improve the knowledge of the NVOCC agents and the other industry stake holders, so that Sri Lanka would be known as a truly professional Maritime hub.
