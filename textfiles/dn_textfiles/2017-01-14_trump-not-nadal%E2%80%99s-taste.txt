Trump not to Nadal’s taste

MADRID: Former tennis world number one Rafael Nadal said Friday that US President-elect Donald Trump was not quite to his taste while lamenting Spanish politics has also, in his view, become too razzmatazz.
“It’s not my style. I was in the United States when Trump was on the campaign trail,” Nadal told Spanish online site El Espanol as he limbered up for the Australian Open.
“It is true that I don’t care for his manner of speaking -- his way of expressing himself is not a style I appreciate,” added Nadal, while conceding he was no expert on the US political scene.
“Also, I’ll be honest -- the other option didn’t do much for me either,” added the Spaniard in allusion to defeated Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Nadal consoled himself with the thought that in a globalised world Trump would not necessarily be able to have things all his own way.
The Mallorcan winner of 14 Grand Slam singles titles was more guarded in his assessment of the incoming president than actress Meryl Streep, who earlier this week used the Golden Globes ceremony to blast Trump.
Nadal did criticise a Spanish political establishment left in virtual paralysis for much of last year after inconclusive December 2015 elections before conservative leader Mariano Rajoy was sworn in to head a new minority government.
