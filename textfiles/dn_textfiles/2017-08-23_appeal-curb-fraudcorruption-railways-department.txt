Appeal to curb fraud,corruption in Railways Department

Sri Lanka Railways Trade Union Federation Co-Convener S.P.Vithanage requests President Maithripala Sirisena to take action against the large scale fraud and corruption in the Railways Department.
He said that there were irregularities in the purchasing of railway compartments, building of railway lines and renting of railway lands.
In addition, the non introduction of new technology,poor maintenance of engines and compartments and handing over of constructions of railway buildings to the private sector in an illegal manner will result in the decline of the Railways Department.
Vithanage appeals to the President to immediately put a stop to the construction of new buildings and for the appointing of a Presidential Commission to investigate these issues.
