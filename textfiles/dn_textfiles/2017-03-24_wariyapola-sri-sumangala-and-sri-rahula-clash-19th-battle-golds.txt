Wariyapola Sri Sumangala and Sri Rahula clash in 19th Battle of the Golds

Wariyapola Sri Sumangala Cricket team
The much awaited 19th Cricket encounter between Wariyapola Sri Sumangala (St. Pauls) College and Sri Rahula College, which is called the “Battle of the Golds” will take place on Friday March 25th and Saturday March 26th. at the Pallekelle International Cricket Stadium. They are also two of the oldest schools in Kandy.
Cricket is one of the major sports at Kandy’s Wariyapola Sri Sumangala (St. Pauls) College. The school has a long history which is 138 years old. It was originated under the name St. Paul’s College as a junior school of Trinity College, Kandy. After laying the first brick on 8th February in 1879, the new school was started as St. Paul’s English School.
It was considered a boys’ school. Later in the 1980s, the name was changed to Wariyapola Sri Sumangala College. They first played cricket in 1894. They gave up the sport and after an 87-year-long layoff; they started playing cricket in 1981.
This was largely due to the efforts of former Sri Lanka cricketer and Kandy Municipal Council Commissioner the late D.H. de Silva. He coached them to play cricket well.
Special mention must be made of D.D.T. Alwis who also coached the school. This time Sri Sumangala (St. Pauls) College are led by Mithun Karunarathne (Captain) and has a good bating line up and are sure to give a good batting display in this most important game.
So, much will be expected from Avishka Pushpakumara, Chamod Premarathne, Sandakan Ekanayake, Miraj Rajapaksha, Isuru Kiulathunga, Shemel Neradya.
Sri Rahula College Katugastota is also one of the oldest cricket playing schools, started the game of cricket in 1890’s but gave it up a few years later and were more involved with football, athletics and hockey.
However, in the 1970’s they came back with cricket. A big hand should go to Aubrey Kuruppu, who did his best as coach, Aubrey is a former St. Thomas’ College, Combined Schools, University of Peradeniya, Saracens CC, Central Province and Sri Lanka President’s XI cricketer and cricket commentator.
He trained many cricketers to come up in the game, unfortunately though, when they come up to under 17 level they are being snatched up by other schools.
Most of the cricketers learned the finer points under him and later joined other schools for better perks, today one player is at national level. Sri Rahula College are led by Dileesha Madushanka a dashing batsman who has made over 500 runs, and also runs are expected from the bats of Chamika Samarasekara, Madushan Paranavithana, Ravindu Kapukotuwa, Krishantha Dilshan
So, it going to be two good days of cricket So, today if the weather stays good, batsmen are expected to dominate game and in this aspect the luck of the coin will go a long way in deciding the outcome of the this biggest and most looked forward cricket match.
