The Kuruwita Cultural Centre's "Penguin" children's dance troupe won the runner-up position at the State Childrens' Drama Competition held recently. They also bagged nine other awards, for best script, best actress, best supporting actor, music, makeup, costumes, and background stage.
The centre recently staged a special animal show called "Pehesaranee" at its headquarters.
Parliamentarian A.A. Wijetunge, who was the chief guest said the talents shown by the children kept him spellbound throughout the show.
He also promised to provide the centre with a photocopy machine. A stock of books worth Rs. 25,000 was also gifted to the centre by A.A. Wijetunge through his decentralized budget funds.
This centre has won great acclaim for the services rendered by it to bestow a group of children imbibed with moral, spiritual, and cultural values to society.
Apart from its normal study courses, the centre also conducts special training workshops, dialogues, and group discussions. Children training at this centre have exhibited their prowess in the local and international stage alike.
