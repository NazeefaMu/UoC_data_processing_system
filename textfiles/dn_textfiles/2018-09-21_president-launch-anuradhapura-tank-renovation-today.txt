President to launch Anuradhapura tank renovation today

A programme to renovate dilapidated tanks in the Anuradhapura district under the Cascaded Tank-Village System will commence today near the Mahawilachchiya, Nabadagasdigiliya tank under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena.
Seventeen tanks in the Mahawilachchiya and Nochchiyagama Divisional Secretariat Divisions have been selected to be renovated under the first phase. Parallel to this programme, many projects will be implemented to uplift the living standards of the people in these areas.
This reconstruction programme, under the national programme to renovate 2,400 tanks, will be implemented in many provinces in Sri Lanka and the renovation work will be carried out with the assistance of the Engineering Regiment of the Sri Lanka Army.
Through the Ellanga System, the excellent irrigational concept of the ancient kingdoms, this reconstruction programme aims to increase storage capacity in rural tanks.
The programme aims to provide a permanent solution to the severe lack of drinking and irrigational water in the Rajarata area.
The maintenance of the balance of the eco-system, increasing the content of water in the soil, increasing the production of agricultural crops, development of the fisheries industry, and development of livelihood opportunities through the field of tourism are some of the expected outcomes.
