Elaborating the cultural festivities that bring communities together, the video effectively touches upon the aspects of devotion and the continuity of rich traditions that are as old as the history itself.
SriLankan Airlines’ Chief Commercial Officer, Siva Ramachandran said they are pleased that their efforts were recognized at the Golden City Awards 2017.”This will certainly motivate us to conceptualize and create more unique content which will help us take Sri Lanka to the world.”

While portraying the country as a hotspot for adventure sports such as surfing and hot air ballooning, the video goes beyond a stereotypical destination video by unveiling the modern luxuries the island has to offer the discerning traveller.
