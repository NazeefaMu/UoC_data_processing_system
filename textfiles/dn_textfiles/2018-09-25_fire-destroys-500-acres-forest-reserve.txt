Fire destroys 500 acres of forest reserve

An extent of 500 acres at Lunugamvehera forest reserve in Udamattala has been reduced to ashes as a result of clearing the land by setting fire to it.
The land had been cleared and set on fire by chena cultivators. Hambantota District Secretary Bandula Harischandra ordered Additional District Secretary Suneth Lochana and a team of state officials to conduct an investigation into the incident.
Wildlife officials in Hambantota said the extent of land had been allocated for wild elephants and as a result of setting fire to it, wild elephants now invade surrounding villages and destroy cultivations.
