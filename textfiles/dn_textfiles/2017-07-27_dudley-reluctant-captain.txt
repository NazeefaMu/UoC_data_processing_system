Dudley: Reluctant captain

The massive crowds, unprecedented in the history that gathered at the Old Parliament and Independence Square, created a sea of heads from Colombo One to Seven; it was filled with people who thronged to pay homage to their leader. The writer who joined the queue at Thunmulla a couple of days before that at mid, paid homage only around seven O’clock in the morning at Woodlands. Dudley was a man of integrity and a true Liberal Democrat. It was a fitting design for the final journey of an unassuming man who ruled the country not for his or for his kith and kin’s benefit.
Three ‘leaders’ of United National Party who became heads of state during 1953-93, could be included in the long list of opponents who maligned, vilified, and disparaged the son of the ‘Father of Nation’ in most deplorable manner on different occasions. These unjust insults and accusations, aiming to damage his reputation campaign started from the day Dudley became Prime Minister for the first time in March 1952, lasted until the last few days he was ailing at Durdans hospital prior to his departure on April 13, 1973.
Political carrier
Dudley Senanayake’s political carrier began in 1936, when the 24-year-old Barrister returned from London to win Dedigama seat in the State Council. Seventeen years later, after serving as Deputy Minister, Minister and Prime Minister, he bid good bye to politics and after leading a spiritual life sans politics for four years. During this period Dudley was actively involved in spreading Buddhism in Germany. However, witnessing the UNP’s debacle under Sir John Kotalawala at the 1956 general elections, and with the rank and file of the party demanding his return, Dudley was forced to re-enter politics in 1957.
The most valuable aspect of Dudley Senanayake’s leadership is the agreement he entered into with the moderate Tamil leader Chelvanaykam in 1965—it addressed several key concessions for the Northerners which included language, devolution and land matters. It was the Closest to a Lasting Solution of all such attempts.
Weak ‘welfare economic’ policies by 1947-52 government saw a depletion of foreign reserves in 1952, compelling the government to totally withdrew the rice subsidy. [60 % of the staple food was imported at 72 cts. a measure, which was sold at 25 cents]. The leaders of two leftist parties, the LSSP and CP saw an opportunity, as tension grew among masses; they called for a Hartal on August 12.
In July 1953 a mass workers rally was organised by the Marxists who controlled 90 percent of trade unions to protest against moves by the government to prune the rice subsidy, a legacy of World War II. Young Marxist firebrands made inciting speeches at a rally held in the city to protest the move. The ‘Hartal’ on August 12, 1953, turned out to be a fierce mass uprising. At the height of the disorder, a panicked government leadership withdrew to a Warship docked in Colombo, from where they carried out the state affairs.
Martial Law and curfew were imposed; Dudley Senanayake was singled out by the opposition and had to countenance most of the criticism.
On August 13, 1953; violent demonstrations in nine districts compelled a reluctant Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake to sign-- ‘shoot at sight with impunity’—a painful decision for the sensitive man of 42 years. The rioting men and women stood disobediently; the Police opened fire causing nine deaths. A couple of months later he resigned from the post of Prime Minister, the leadership of United National Party and from politics altogether.
Unitary and stable Sri Lanka
The assassination of Prime Minister SWRD Bandaranaike in 1959 and the confused political environment led to the parliament being dissolved and an election being held in March 1960. Dudley was invited to form a government in a hung parliament. His unstable minority government lasted only a month. Later, in 1965 following an electoral success at general elections, he became PM for the fourth time in a coalition led by the UNP.
‘Senanayake––Chelvanayakam Pact of 1965’
Dudley, back in politics was in search of a lasting solution to the Language, Ethnic and Minority issues. The ‘Dudley––Chelvanayakam Pact’ was signed between Senanayake, the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka and S. J. V. Chelvanayakam, leader of the Federal Party on March 24, 1965. Political analysts believe this unique agreement was a major progressive step towards a unitary and stable Sri Lanka.
Excerpts from the Text of the Pact….
“Mr. Dudley Senanayake and Mr. S.J.V. Chelvanayakam met on March 24, 1965 and discussed matters relating to some problems over which the Tamil-speaking people were concerned, and Mr. Senanayake agreed that action on the following lines would be taken by him to ensure a stable government:
(01) Action will be taken early under the Tamil Language Special Provisions Act to make provision of the Tamil Language of Administration and of Record in the Northern and Eastern Provinces.
Mr. Senanayake explained that it was the policy of his party that a Tamil-speaking person should be entitled to transact business in Tamil throughout the island.
(02) Mr. Senanayake stated that it was the policy of his party to amend the Languages of Courts Act to provide for legal proceedings in the Northern and Eastern Provinces to be conducted and recorded in Tamil.
(03)Action will be taken to establish District Councils in Ceylon vested with powers over subjects to be mutually agreed upon between two leaders. It was agreed, however, that the government should have power under the law to give directions to such councils under the national interest.
(04) The Land Development Ordinance will be amended to provide that citizens of Ceylon be entitled to the allotment of land under the Ordinance.
Mr. Senanayake further agreed that in the granting of land under colonisation schemes, the following priorities be observed in the Northern and Eastern provinces:
(A) Land in the Northern and Eastern provinces should in the first instance be granted to landless persons in the district.
(B) Secondly, to Tamil-speaking persons resident in the Northern and Eastern provinces.
(C) Thirdly, to other citizens in Ceylon, preference being given to Tamil citizens in the rest of the island.”
The main opposition SLFP under Sirimavo, and strangely, the Marxists LSSP and CP joined hands in protest against the pact with the blessings of the ‘Maha Sangha’ leading to abrogation of the pact. It was a settlement that could have re-enfranchised the Tamil-speaking citizens. Government’s failure to rally sufficient support for it within the majority community in the South had disastrous consequences for the nation. Had it been put into action, Sri Lanka would have been a lively, peaceful nation. This pact illustrated Dudley’s vision and insight to comprehend what was desirable to arrive at an adjustment with the minorities.
“Dear father, I have decided to resign from the State Council…”- Dudley
“ …The two of us are under the same roof… As your son, I find it difficult to act in this manner. Sometimes I cannot agree with some of the proposals made by you to the State Council on behalf of the Board of Ministers. On many occasions, I have to steadfastly oppose you. Such a thing happened today also. It caused me severe mental distress. So I have decided to resign from the State Council.”– Dudley.
A young minister once wrote to father DS, for the senior Senanayake to reply allowing the son full freedom to oppose him at the Cabinet— criticize him openly; lessons for present generation of politicians who think their word should be the final and the rest would have little say....but follow the leader or face consequences.
A bachelor captained fathers XI against sons at St Thomas’ in 1963
‘In April 1963, the man who left no offspring and heir to carry the Senanayake name played for a ‘Fathers’ Cricket XI. Dudley, the then Leader of the Opposition, took part in a …by St Thomas’ Preparatory, Bandarawela, when the ‘sons’ played against the ‘fathers’. “I do not know by what stretch of the imagination they have included me in this team”, Dudley the bachelor chuckled. Perhaps for the man who captained St Thomas’ in his early thirties, temptation to play the game was too strong to resist, so he accepted the invitation and played.
