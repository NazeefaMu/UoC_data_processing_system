Missing Persons Office operational from Friday

The Office of the Missing Persons (OMP) is to come into operation on September 15.
President Maithripala Sirisena on Tuesday night in his capacity as National Integration and Reconciliation Minister, signed the Gazette Extraordinary number 2036/21 to operationalise the Office of the Missing Persons (establishment, administration and discharge of functions).
The Act No 14 of 2016 and amended by Act no 9 of 2017 will now come into operation from September 15.
National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry Secretary V. Sivagnanasothy said the initiative came a week after the discussions the President had with the family members of the missing.
On Monday, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein making his opening remarks at the 36th session of UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, too urged the government to swiftly operationalise the OMP.
The President will appoint commissioners to run it.
