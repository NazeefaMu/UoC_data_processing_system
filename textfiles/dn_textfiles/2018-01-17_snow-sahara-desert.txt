Snow in Sahara desert

Desert town Ain Sefra, also known as the “Gateway to the Sahara,” got to experience snow in one of the hottest regions on the planet. Almost 40 cm deep, the Independent reported.
Recently, a photographer captured the stunning scenes as snow covered desert dunes. This has happened only three times in the past 40 years.
“It seems like the snowy pictures were taken across the higher areas in the north of the region, towards the Atlas regions, so it’s not surprising that the area would see some snow if the conditions were right,” a spokeswoman for the Met Office told The Independent.
Adding, “With the setup over Europe at the moment, which has given us cold weather over the weekend, a push southwards of cold air into that region and some sort of moisture would bring that snow.”
It melted away later that same day due to rising temperatures.
