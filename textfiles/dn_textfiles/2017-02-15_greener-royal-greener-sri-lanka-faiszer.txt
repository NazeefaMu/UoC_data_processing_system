Greener Royal is Greener Sri Lanka: Faiszer

A greener Royal is a greener Sri Lanka because the students here today is capable of taking the message of a greener Sri Lanka through a greener Royal, than any other school,” Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha said.
He was addressing the gathering where an MoU was signed yesterday between the Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry and Royal College for the pilot project initiated for waste management at Royal College. Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry Secretary Kamal Padmasiri and Royal College Principal B.A. Abeyrathne signed the MoU.
The minister said this is the first programme initiated by the ministry involving a school. “I don’t believe in doing things ad-hoc. When I came last time, the school prefects made a presentation; their commitment to this project is appreciable,” he said.
The programme was proposed targeting the schoolchildren to practise an environmental friendly living. Royal College initiated the project, and it will be implemented in schools island-wide.
The principal said selling polythene milk packets in the school is prohibited as the first step. The students will be given fresh milk instead. The programme also encourage students to generate alternative energy sources as a solution for future energy crisis.
