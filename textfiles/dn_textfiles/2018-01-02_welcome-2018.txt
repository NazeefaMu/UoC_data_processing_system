Welcome 2018..!

The night was dark and at the Gate of Time the old watchman was half asleep. Suddenly he heard the sound of eerie maniacal laughter. "Who goes there?" shouted the old watchman of the Gate of Time.
"Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!" laughed a voice
"Who goes there?" shouted the old sentry again wearily.
"2017!"
"Oh, it's you is it?" asked the old sentry, "You sure have changed 2017! You're drunk!"
"The Earth people gave me a sendoff party! A farewell, and I drank with them as they kicked me out! I like them, I loved them watchman dear and lived just like them for the whole year I was down there on earth, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!"
The old watchman who had seen thousands of years pass by, shook his sadly; it always happened: When the years went down to earth, with bells ringing and people singing, they went with firm determination, great ideas and plans to change things down there, but when their time was up, they were a mess.
"Yes!" sighed the watchman as he looked at the miserable 2017 standing in front of him, "it's all because of those earth people down there. They corrupt their time, they're the ones who've spoiled and tainted Two Thousand and Seventeen and all the years before!"
"What did you do on earth 2017?" asked the watchman sadly
"What didn't I do?" laughed the drunk year, "I started communal hatred where people lived as brothers before, I broke down churches, burnt mosques and destroyed monasteries. I drove farmers to suicide as their lands remained barren, I elected presidents who threatened to build walls and others who threatened nuclear strikes!"
"Didn't you do any good at all?"
"Sure I did!" smiled the Old Year, "I showed married people the joys of divorce and drove them out of wedlock; gave children freedom with drugs and alcohol! Ha, ha, ha! You should have seen them all drunk, drugged and depraved all the time! Ha! Ha! Ha!"
The old watchman shuddered and watched the Old Year stagger and vanish into the past. And then he heard new footsteps outside the Gate of Time.
"Who goes there?" he shouted.
"Two Thousand and Eighteen!" shouted an eager voice.
"What’s the password?"
"Peace!"
"Welcome 2018!" shouted the watchman happily as he opened the gate and let the New Year through. He watched the New Year, a bundle of joy and happiness, love and hope, descend to Earth. "Oh you people of Earth, treat him well! Love him, respect him and what a year Two Thousand and Eighteen could be for you! It's in your hands oh people down below!"
The old watchman sighed as he hobbled back to The Gate of Time and sat down wearily to wait another year. “Bob, wish your readers a Happy New Year,” he whispered, “Tell them, do treat 2018 well, and what a year it will be for them..!
