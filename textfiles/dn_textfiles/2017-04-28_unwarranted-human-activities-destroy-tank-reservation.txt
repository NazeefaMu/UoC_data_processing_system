Unwarranted human activities destroy tank reservation

Unwarranted human activities, including the encroachment of the tank reservation cause environmental pollution at Anuradhapura Nuwarawewa reservoir. The capacity of the tank is 36,050 af.
The Nuwarawewa is the main water source to provide drinking water to 300,000 population. Nearly 100 acres of the tank reservation, including the tank bed has been encroached.
The majority of tourist hotels and holiday resorts in the Nuwarawewa tank are located within the tank reservation.
Public organisations and farmer organisations have made representation to the District Agriculture Committee, the District Secretary and the Zonal Irrigation Director about this menace.
Although a special committee was appointed three years ago to investigate causes that damage Nuwarawewa tank, including water contamination and unlimited encroachment, the report submitted by the committee has not been utilised to find solutions.
