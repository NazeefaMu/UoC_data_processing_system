never Old enough

It was a day in 1930. An eight-year boy was rummaging through the paper bales wrapped in used foreign newspapers. He developed a deep fascination with the printed matter – excerpts from the New York Times. The excerpts provided detailed insights into US politics. Access to any foreign source – let alone reading them free of charge - was out of the ordinary during this period.
There lay the seeds of Dr Edwin Ariyadasa’s enduring enthusiasm on the matters pertaining to the United States of America. That said, it comes as no surprise when Dr Ariyadasa, who turned 96 on December 3, launched his latest chronicle, a volume containing the United States Declaration of Independence, the US Constitution, the first amendment and a tabulated series of presidential addresses on crucial occasions of the US political chronology. The volume is titled as Vimukthi Prakashana, the latest addition to Dr Ariyadasa’s long bibliography.
Ninety-six, yes that’s a go figure! Even at 96, Dr Edwin Ariyadasa is a common sight at many events mostly delivering a guest lecture. Walking mostly unaided, the nonagenarian still maintains the time-honoured niche as walking encyclopaedia with the clarity of speech.
Born on December 3, 1922, in Unawatuna, to V K Abraham Appuhamy and Sisiliana Hamine, Edwin was the youngest in a family of five. Following secondary education at Mahinda College, Galle, Edwin entered the University of Ceylon in 1945 to read for his Bachelors in Sinhala and English.
“I was never interested in postgraduate studies,” Ariyadasa muses today, “I was passionate about teaching.” But that choice did not favour Ariyadasa for long. Strange and strong memory power coupled with bilingualism was a marked trait of Dr Edwin Ariyadasa evident to this date. That extraordinary attribute installed him in a cynosure position among various strata, be it academic and otherwise.
“The then Chairperson of Lake House, Esmond Wickremesinghe, offered me a choice between Daily News and Dinamina. It was Dinamina Editor, Piyasena Nissanka, who wanted me in. I naturally opted for Sinhala journalism. But I contributed to the English press as well occasionally,” Ariyadasa elaborates the genesis of his career well established in the fourth estate. He was a staff member of Divaina, Daily News, Sunday Observer, Silumina, Janatha and went on to become the editor in chief of Nawayugaya.
And today, on this day of December 11, 2018, Dr Edwin Ariyadasa remains the oldest living journalist and writer.
Dr Edwin Ariyadasa has his own reasoning to introduce the US Constitution to the local audience.
“There is a constant dialogue about the Constitution today. Most countries do not have written constitutions. The US Constitution is the oldest written constitution still in use today among nations. It offers us many lessons to ponder,” Dr Ariyadasa explains.
The presidential addresses begin with George Washington and end with Richard Nixon. The addresses, Dr Ariyadasa believes, indicate the strength of the political thinking even way back in the 17th and 18th centuries.
“I translated these speeches from time to time. I recently assembled them for the publishing purpose. All this is available in the public domain, and I wonder why no one was bothered to translate them into Sinhala.”
Dr Ariyadasa who belongs to the yesteryear generation is not techno-savvy. But the techno-savvy crowd depends on him for knowledge of yore. I am a qualified vegetarian, Ariyadasa states in reference to his lifestyle.
“Qualified in the sense there are limitations to my vegetarianism. I eat fish, but not meat. This has no religious reason. It is simply because meat does not agree with my body system. I gave up on liquor and smoking a long time ago. On the other hand, I always make it a point not to get tense or anxious.”
Dr Edwin Ariyadasa never gets fed up with studying how the US political machinery works. His current reading list includes ‘What Happened’ authored by Hillary Rodham Clinton elaborating why she lost to Donald Trump at the 2016 Presidential Election. Ariyadasa is fond of British politics as well especially owing to its monarchy element fused with frugal parliamentary structure.
“I have not visited that Parliament. But I have seen it on television. It is considered the mother of all Parliaments. It is very much visible as the Prime Minister has to sit with other MPs on a long bench. That humility is touching especially as it is the institution that ensures justice of the common people. And their deference to monarchy is simply unbelievable.”
Sri Lanka had done better under the monarchy, Ariyadasa maintains. When the politicians voted into power try to establish an unlawful monarchy, why not let a traditional monarchy resume control of the country, Ariyadasa questions.
Vimukthi Prakasha, a Sarasavi publication, will be a good manual for the local politicians to shape their thinking processes, Dr Ariyadasa remarks.
