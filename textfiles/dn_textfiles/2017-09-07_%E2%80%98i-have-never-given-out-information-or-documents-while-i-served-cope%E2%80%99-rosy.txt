‘I have never given out information or documents while I served in COPE’: Rosy

Former Member of Parliament Rosy Senanayake, in a statement released to the media this evening, denied having given out any information or documents relating to COPE investigations.
“I have never given out information or documents to any party during the time I have served in the COPE,” the former MP said in a statement.
“It is a total misrepresentation by the media of a recorded conversation by two parties that had no substance. I will take all necessary steps against such media organizations who have used it to cast aspersions on my character and integrity,” Senanayake said.
“Whilst the media continuously reported on COPE proceeding at the time, I have not at any time given out information with regard to the proceeding in any form.”
“The recorded conversation that took place in August 2016 by at which time I was not a member of COPE nor was I a member of parliament. Therefore my son has no access whatsoever to such information and he has not been requested to provide any such information nor would he have accepted such a request by any party,” she said.
“Any person reading the media reports can clearly see that they are using this third party conversation as a headline grabber whereas there is zero substance in the details. I am deeply saddened by this undeserved attack and will do all that is necessary to keep the public informed of the reality of the situation,” the ex-MP said.
