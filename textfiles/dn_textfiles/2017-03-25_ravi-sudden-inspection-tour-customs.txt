Ravi on sudden inspection tour at Customs

Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake went on an urgent inspection tour at the Sri Lanka Customs yesterday midnight.
The Minister inspected the two container yards at Orugodawatta and the Customs Headquarters. The ministry had received many complaints that the functions of the department are slow and that triggered the need for an urgent inspection tour. Another objective of the tour is to ascertain whether the Customs operations are carried out systematically round the clock.
The Customs officials at the container yard were surprised by the minister’s unexpected visit. The minister also engaged in a conversation with the representatives of importers to release their containers. Speaking to the representatives, the minister asked them to educate him if there is any delay.
The minister discussed the problems faced by the Customs officers in discharging their duties.
He specially looked into the online system introduced to facilitate the release of imported goods. Minister Karunanayake, who enquired the process of releasing containers to their owners since they reach the port, also enquired about the illegal import of cigarettes reported by the media recently.
Customs Director General Chulananda Perera told the minister the officials were surprised to find only some furniture inside the particular container.
The Minister met some officers engaged in night duty and appreciated their hard work.
“We came to know by importers that there is a delay in Customs process. Consequently, we chose to engage in an inspection tour at slack time of this nature. We observed that the Customs is processing very well. However, certain things should be updated. Import and export activities are carried out within 24 hours in other countries.
Our Customs is similarly engaged in such work schedules but services of Wharf clerks are not up to the expectation due to certain disputed circumstances,” the minister said.
The Customs Director General said the services rendered by Customs officers should be lauded. He said the visit by the minister to witness their hard work in this dead night is an attempt to appreciate their inestimable services. He also commended the minister for his visit and said the tiring efforts being taken by the minister irrespective of day and night would demonstrate the whole country of his commitment and dedication to his duty.
