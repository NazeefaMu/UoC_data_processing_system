World Bank to assist  SL in agriculture  development project

The World Bank had pledged to assist Sri Lanka to implement a special agriculture development project in the Hambantota and Anuradhapura districts, following a request made by Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera during a meeting held with Sustainable Development Programme Leader covering Sri Lanka and the Maldives Andrew Goodland, at the Agriculture Ministry, recently.
Measures that should be taken to uplift countries’ agriculture exports were discussed at the meeting. Usage of modern technologies, importance of recognising export-oriented agriculture development procedures, among other topics related to agriculture development, were also discussed.
Agriculture Ministry Secretary B. Wijeratne and Sri Lanka Council For Agricultural Research Policy (SLCARP) Chairman Jerry Jayawardane participated in the occasion.
