Steps taken to provide pure  drinking water – Minister Hakeem

"The underground water in the Kalpitiya peninsula contains high concentrations of chemicals and drinking that water has an acute danger of giving birth to disabled or deformed children. There is no alternative for getting pure drinking water in this area. Steps are being taken to desalinate sea water in this area with foreign assistance and provide pure drinking water to the people", said City Planning and Water Supply Minister and the leader of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress Rauff Hakeem.
Minster Hakeem made these observations addressing a meeting held to extend support for the candidates contesting for the Kalpitiya Pradeshiy Sabha under the Tree symbol of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress.
Minister Hakeem said that underground water in the Kalpitiya area has become contaminated with various kinds of chemicals. It has reached dangerous levels for human consumption. Since there is a high concentration of Nitrogen in this water, the children given birth to in the area has a bluish complexion.
As there is not sufficient water in the ‘Kala Oya’ to supply to this area through pipelines, we are in the process of desalinating sea water and supply pure water thereby to the people of Kalpitiya.
The Minister said that the Japanese Ambassador in Sri Lanka will be brought on a visit to this area for him to make an observation study.
Minister Hakeem said that a large amount of electricity is required for desalination of sea water and therefore steps have been taken to hold discussions with a German Firm to generate more electricity through Wind Power.
He said that funds required to provide pure drinking water through desalination of sea water to people in Jaffna and Kalpitiya have been earmarked and it has been planned to establish a Water Purification Centre close to the Kalpitiya Navy Camp.
The Minister said that in addition to this, a programme has also been launched simultaneously to get necessary assistance to this project.
Steps have also been taken to commence the work of the Puttalam South Water Supply Project.
This project will help to provide safe drinking water to other areas of Puttalam as well.
Minister Hakeem stated that steps will also be taken to provide necessary funds from his Ministry to renovate roads in the Puttalam area.
Since the people of the area have requested from the regional political authority to renovate and develop the Alankuda Hospital, he said that steps will be taken to fulfil this request through the Health Deputy Minister who is a representative of his Party.
