‘A leader should be  dedicated and ambitious’

A leader should be dedicated and ambitious in order achieve success, Adivasi Chief Uruwarige Wannila Aththo said.
Wannila Aththo said that no one could build a leader except the person who strove to be one.
He was addressing a crowd recently, while taking part in the prefects’ badge-pinning ceremony at the Molagoda Jayapala Maha Vidyalaya in Kegalle.
One must acquire and sharpen certain skills to become a leader, he said, adding that things taught at school were not enough.
“Patience and the ability to listen to others are compulsory qualities a leader must have,” he added. Wannila Aththo said that although the country was developing, people’s qualities were headed the opposite direction.
Some students neither respect parents nor their teachers; they do not even respect the clergy, he said, adding that those were qualities a leader did not possess.
