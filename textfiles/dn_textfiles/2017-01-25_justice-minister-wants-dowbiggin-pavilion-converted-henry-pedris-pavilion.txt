Justice Minister wants Dowbiggin Pavilion converted to Henry Pedris Pavilion

Minister of Justice and Buddhist Affairs Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe has requested that the name of ‘Dowbiggin Pavilion’ at the Police Department’s Havelock Grounds be renamed as ‘Henry Pedris’ Pavilion. The request sent to the President and Prime Minister, explained that Herbert Dowbiggin who acted as the Inspector General of Police (IGP) during the British era actively orchestrated ethnic tension between the different communities and tortured many Sinhalese and Tamils. He also was involved in opening several taverns in a bid to sabotage the Temperance Movement. Hence Rajapakshe pointed out that it was an insult to continue with his name and instead asked that the pavilion be renamed with the name of Pedris who sacrificed his life for the independence of the country.
Dowbiggin had been held responsible for stirring up trouble between the Sinhalese and Muslims during the ethnic riots of May 1915 through the Perahera from Gampola to Kandy. As the Sinhala-Muslim riots flared, the British IGP would bring down Marati and Gurka soldiers from India to quell the riots. Many were tortured and raped in the process. Dowbiggin has also been accused of imprisoning freedom fighters D. S. Senanayake, F. R. Senanayake, Braun Jayathilake, A.E. Gunasinghe, Piyadasa Sirisena and the brothers of Anagarika Dharmapala; Edmond Hewavitharana, C.A. Hewavitharana, Charles Batuwanthudawe and Ven. Battaramulle Subhitha. He had fabricated evidence and shot Captain Henry Pedris to set an example for the rest. During his tenure as IGP, Dowbiggin executed 69 and sentence 83 to life imprisonment.
