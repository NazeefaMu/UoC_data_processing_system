Three main pipe lines damaged by landslides

Three of five main pipe lines belonging to the Labugama and Kalatuwawa water treatment plants have been completely damaged by landslides, City Planning and Water Supply Minister Hakeem said.
He also said the workers are unable to reach the destroyed pipe line, as the NBRO has prohibited anyone from going to the area in the aftermath of the landslide.
“The water supply to Colombo will not be affected by this situation,” Minister Hakeem said.
The Minister also said water pumping stations at Wakwella, Ranna, Hungama, Tangalle and Weligama have temporarily been shut down due to the flood situation.
He also said difficulties have occurred in providing clean drinking water to certain affected areas, as there is no road access.
