Suspects who abused police inspector refused bail

Panadura Chief Magistrate Chandena Liyanage refused to remand two suspects who surrendered to Court on notice issued by the Court in connection with an incident which occurred at the office of the Head Quarters Chief Inspector Thusara de Silva of the Panadura South Police Station on December 19.
When the two suspects Bimal Yasoman and S Asanka Manjula Fernado appeared before Court on January 9, Police Sergeant Samanlal Edirissinghe of the Panadura South Police Crime Branch, submitting a B report signed by the OIC of the Panadura South Police Crime Branch, informed the magistrate that the police are conducting further investigations into the incident.
The suspects had attempted to take photographs of a body of a candidate of the Podujana Peramuna (Pohottuwa) who had died while he was proceeding to sign his nomination papers to contest the Panadura Pradeshiya Sabha.
While he was proceeding in a motor car to sign the nomination papers on January 19, 2017, he had suffered a fatal heart attack. His body was then rushed to the Panadura Base Hospital Mortuary.
Meanwhile, the two suspects attempted to enter the hospital forcibly and tried to take a photograph of the body of the candidate.
The relations had objected and a heated argument between the suspects and the relations of the deceased had taken place.
The two suspects who had posed as journalists had been taken to the P:andura South Police Station by two policemen. They had entered the office of the Pandura South Police Head Quarters Chief Inspector Indika Thusara de Silva and had a heated argument with him and abused him, saying that they could do anything from complaining to the DIG Senanayake and getting the HQI transferred.
They threatened the Panadura Police South HQI and fled. There were witnesses to the incident. The Chief Magistrate ordered personal bail of Rs 1 million with two sureties for each of the suspects and ordered recording of the statements of the two suspects.
The case was postponed for April 24. The suspects were kept in a Court cell until the police recorded their statements as ordered by the Court.
