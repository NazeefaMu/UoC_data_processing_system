The Governor tales
Legendary rule of Sir John Anderson

He is the second Anderson to rule here as governor. He too rules only for three years as governor, not because he is recalled as his predecessor, but because he dies here, only British governor to breathe his last here and be buried at Borella cemetery off capital Colombo. His grave is said to be the best kept one in this sprawling complex of the dead.
Anderson died of appencitis and died at Nuwaraeliya. This glamorous city seemed to have become a favorite haunt of these governors. Remember the legend about Chalmers, that he and his wife were holidaying n this city when news reached of the demise of their two sons in the World War?
Anyway Anderson's death so far away had triggered the longest funeral procession of the times. The crowds lining the roads had been so thick that finally the coach carrying the casket had simply flown, leading to British newspaper captions that screamed on the corpse that flew in the colony.
Why was John Anderson so popular? That calls for a story. His rule followed that of Chalmers when during the famous riots, military rulers had their day. They teamed up with the trouble makers and one thing leading to another, a good many locals forfeited their property. This was the situation when the new governor arrived who appointed a committee and restored the property rights of many Sinhala Buddhists in the affected area. Here was gratitude shown.
Going back to his bio data, he was born in June 1858 at Aberdeen.
Educated at Aberdeen University he won the gold medal for the best student. He held many a state post that earned him an earlier visit to the island. He seems to have been a popular figure in European society in the east, especially as governor of Malaya. He was so popular there too that the Malayan sultans had gifted him a battleship. The last posts he held before coming here is that of permanent secretary at the Colonial office.
By this time the home govt. had realized that matters had gone awry in the colony of Ceylon and also come to the conclusion that the benevolent man Anderson was the most fitting for the needed salve.
And he did prove himself. Anderson, writes Hulugalle, carried out the task assigned to him with courage and candour thereby endearing himself toil the permanent population. He took steps to appoint a commission of inquiry that included the chief justice. This commission came up with the finding that the shootings that took place in the former governor's time had no legal justification.
The governor found a true friend in Maha Mudaliyar Solomon Dias Bandaranaike and their friendship resulted in this beautiful piece perhaps framed near his deathbed.
"Sir John was the first governor of this country to die while his term of office in Ceylon was yet unfinished and every circumstance combined to make his death a matter of general and universal grief, sol that it seemed almost a personal loss"
