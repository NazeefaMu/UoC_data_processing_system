SLPP files three writ petitions over nomination rejections

Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) yesterday filed three writ petitions in the Supreme Court naming Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya and several others as respondents. This is regarding rejection of its nominations in respect of three local government institutions.
In one writ petition, SLPP secretary Sagara Kariyawasam is seeking a writ of Mandamus directing the Returning Officer appointed for the Maharagama Urban Council to accept the nomination paper delivered to the Election Officer by the SLPP authorised agent for the election of members to the Maharagama Urban Council.
The SLPP also filed two other petitions in the Supreme Court in respect of Mahiyangana and Agalawatta Pradeshiya Sabha.
The nomination papers handed by the SLPP in respect of Maharagama Urban Council were rejected on the ground that it did not contain the total number of women candidates in terms of subsection (2A) of section 28 of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance. At a previous occasion several candidates contesting the Maharagama Urban Council had filed a separate writ petition over the same issue.
The SLPP is also seeking an Interim Order restraining the Election Commission from taking further steps under the provisions of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance to proceed with holding the election to the Maharagama Urban Council, Mahiyangana and Agalawatta Pradeshiya Sabha.
The petitioners cited Assistant Commissioner of Elections (Colombo, Badulla and Kalutara Districts), Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya and two other members of Election Commission, SLFP General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake,UNP General Secretary Kabeer Hasheem, JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva and several others as respondents.
