CARE to SHARE : Organ donation, saving lives

Despite widespread need for donor organs in Sri Lanka, the nation has a long way to go when it comes to improving the rate of organ donation and transplant. Recently, Cabinet approved a proposal put forward by the Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine to include information on whether a person is a donor or not in his/her Driver’s license. The proposal if implemented would provide hospital authorities with vital information in the event of an accident.
These proposals come in the midst of Sri Lanka increasingly having the need for a national transplant programme to meet the existing demand for organs, said Transplant Surgeon at the National Hospital of Sri Lanka (NHSL), Dr Ruwan Dissanayake.
He further noted that as a country that has great potential for organ transplant, we should consider the number of possible options for improving organ donation systems and expand the amount of organs available for transplant options.
Need for a proper transplantation system
According to Dr. Dissanayake the lack of a proper system to coordinate organ transplant was a huge problem faced by the medical community.
Health statistics show that annually more than 2,000 people die due kidney failure. Nearly 1,700 die due to Cirrhosis or advanced liver disease; this statistic is limited to state hospitals. In that context more than 4,000 people die every year due to liver and kidney failure alone in this country. The medical community considers this as one of the biggest health problems that needs to be immediately addressed.
“The only lasting solution for such diseases is an organ transplant which will give the patient a second lease on life,” said Dr. Dissanayake.
At present the most common manner of organ donation is through live donors and he said there were eight kidney transplant centres attached to national hospitals in the country with nearly 400 transplants done every year.
“When more than 2,000 people are dying due to kidney failure, only 400 transplants are conducted. We have a problem even though Sri Lanka has high potential to deal with the issue. We need to have a systematic organ transplant system,” he said.
He added that liver failure was also another significant problem as Sri Lanka does not have an effective liver transplant programme.
“Currently there are only two programmes pertaining to liver transplant and one is at the National Hospital in Colombo and the other is at the North Colombo Teaching Hospital. We have conducted nearly 10 public awareness programmes over the last five years,” he said.
“The main problem is that we are not effectively using the donors. There are a lot issues related to live donations; of which some are ethical, social and financial issues as well. The ethical issue here is you can’t sell an organ, donation has to be a donation. Sri Lankan law does not allow to do that,” he added.
Many countries, according to Dr. Dissanyake have overcome the problem by having almost 95 percent of organs being retrieved from brain dead donors.
“When a patient dies in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) while being supported by ventilator and other drugs, the ICU doctors have to confirm brain death. There are a series of tests that they have to do and once they are done twice, the patient is legally declared dead. Then the ICU doctors can make an offer to the transplant teams in the hospitals. We have appointed transplant coordinators and they counsel the family and get the consent for organ retrieval. We promote this because it’s free of charge and then it can be allocated in a transparent manner,” he said.
This system which is practiced in few hospitals is not an island wide programme as there is no national system in place.
“We are trying to make it an island wide programme. Last year we organised a national conference and we established an inter connection between 81 ICUs around the country. The transplant coordinators attached to the National hospitals have contacts with all the ICUs and they notify them when there is a brain dead patient,” he added.
Dr. Dissanyake said they were also trying to introduce a liver transplant programme as it was a costly service at the private hospitals.
“The Ministry of Health is currently taking the necessary initiatives for it. There are national level transplantation programmes in foreign countries which are very effective. In the USA, it’s ‘United Network of organ sharing (UNOS)’, in the UK it’s ‘National Health Service Blood and Transplant (NHSBT)’ and in Australia it’s ‘Donate Life’. List of donors, recipients and all the details are included. A national programme would make the process much easier,” he said.
Challenges pertaining to organ transplant process
With the development of science and technology organ and tissue transplant gives many benefits to patients. Living humans as well as brain dead or dead via circulatory death may donate organs if their willingness is declared earlier.
At present as there are no major programmes initiated, the medical officers who are interested in the transplantation field are involved in the process. Therefore, Dr. Dissanayake pointed out the need for awareness among medical officers as well as the public.
“Creating awareness among people is not enough, it is also equally important to make the health care workers aware that they need to improve their knowledge on technical and scientific issues related to it. It is not easy to make people understand about brain death and the organ retrieval procedure,” he said.
He further said that the administration has planned for a major awareness programme in 2017.
Meanwhile, he pointed out that no one had control over the ICUs when there was a brain death and it was simply coordination among the appointed transplantation coordinators.
In medical terms brain death and death were the same. When there was brain death, the organs functioned with the support of the machines. Though Sri Lanka was a nation open to donation, many family members were reluctant to accept the patient as dead when his organs continue to work with the use of machines.
“If there is a national programme the health care workers will be obliged to contribute to the cause.
The relatives usually say that the patient is still surviving with the machines and that they are reluctant to give their consent but if there was a national programme, at least to a greater extent the problems pertaining to organ transplantation can be solved,” he said.
Medical officers are always ready to provide the necessary service. There are necessary equipment, cold storage boxes and transportation facilities. Even if there is a call from Anuradhapura or Pollonnaruwa there are services to immediately address the problem, he added.
It is in such circumstances that the Cabinet decision to include organ donation information in the Drivers license has come into the fore, many drivers experience accidents that cause brain or circulatory death.
Dr. Dissanayake said that was a great achievement by the Health Ministry
“Implementation of this process will promote organ donation. At present Sri Lankan law says the next of kin has to give consent for the donation to take place. That is the hardest thing to get. In some countries, the consent can be obtained over the phone, we don’t have that,” he said.
He further said starting a transplantation programme is not easy but added that the nation has got ample trained surgeons.
“We have to establish a system first and Sri Lanka has potential for transplant. Ministerial level discussions are currently taking place.
This is not for the benefit of doctors, it is a public service. We need the support of every citizen,” he added.
Medico – legal issues
In addition to the medical issues there are also medico – legal issues pertaining to organ transplant when retrieving organs from a brain dead person.
Colombo Chief Judicial Medical Officer, Dr. Ajith Tennakoon said organ transplantation in Sri Lanka was governed by Transplantation of Human Tissue Act – 1987 and added that changes were needed to the Act to improve the service.
The Human Tissue Transplantation Act No. 50 of 1987 was introduced in the latter part of the twentieth century to regularise some aspects of tissue retention mainly in the direction of transplantation. The first Kidney transplantation was done in Sri Lanka in 1988 and many transplants have been done subsequently.
He further said that the legal documents describe how to get the consent, the eligible donors and also about the people who are authorised to retrieve the organs.
“But Section 19 states, this Act shall be applied to inquiries held into death and that restricts the medical officers from retrieving organs from a brain dead person,” said Dr Tennakkoon.
He further explained the main problem here is that many potential healthy organ donors are victims of violence and road trauma, where release of the bodies are subjected to an inquest followed by autopsy examination, under the provisions of the criminal procedure code.
The provisions of the criminal procedure code cannot be overruled by the transplantation Act. However, there is no legal bar for consented removal of the organs once the corpse is released after the autopsy. However, the medical community has to overcome the legal inconsistencies by mutual understanding between the transplant team and the JMO. The Ministry of Health issued a special circular in 2010 to deal with the issue.
“We have made the JMO a part of the transplantation team. After the brain death is confirmed with the consent of the relatives the coroner will be informed. He has to give permission to do the autopsy in front of the JMO and submit the report,” he said.
The law should incorporate what is currently being followed. The coroner should be empowered to grant permission and the JMO to go ahead with the organ transplantation process, he pointed out.
He noted that the law should be amended stating that the driving license was adequate for organ retrieval but if the next of kin refused to consent even after that, the doctors would face a great dilemma.
Dr. Tennakoon said once organ transplantation coordinators are appointed in every hospital, the problems would be relatively less but the system needed to be improved further.
Thus deceased donor organ donation from brain dead donors is a possibility in Sri Lanka according to the medical officers. However, there is no established donor organ donation service; the establishment of such a service may help save thousands of lives.
