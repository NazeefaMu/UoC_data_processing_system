GALGAMUWA TENSE DUE TO WATER ISSUE:
PROTESTERS AGAINST COMPANY BOTTLING WATER

A tense situation had erupted at the Thambuttegama town as police fired tear gas and water cannons at protesters who were pelting stones at the Thambuttegama Police Station yesterday.
The Police Media reported that the police had arrested 39 men and five women in the process.
Tambuttegama Police in the meantime have also reported that four of its officers had incurred minor injuries during the clash and were admitted to hospital.
A large number of villagers had gathered near the police station staging a protest blocking the Kurunegala-Anuradhapura road at the Police Junction in Thambuttegama, in protest against water of the Rajanganaya Wewa being given to a Chinese company.
The protestors claimed that the Rajanganaya Wewa provides water to 17,000 acres of cultivations by the villagers, but the authorities had now given permission to a Chinese bottled water company to utilise the Rajanganaya Wewa water, depriving the farmers of water for their cultivation.
The entire village had joined in the protest which blocked the Kurunegala-Anuradhapura main road, causing heavy traffic congestion.
However, when contacted for comments, the Police Media Spokesman’s Office said they had not received any information regarding the incident.
