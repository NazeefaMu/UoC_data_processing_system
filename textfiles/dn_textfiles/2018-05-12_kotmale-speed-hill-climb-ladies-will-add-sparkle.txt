2nd round Cup rugby
Two second round fixtures for the Cup Championship will be worked of today in Kandy. At Bogambara, Kingswood will host Isipthana. This game can turn out either way as both schools are blessed with good players. At Pallekelle, St. Peter’s will be the guests of Trinity. Both sides are equally balanced and the team which plays well should be the winners. Peterites with their formidable line up will strive to win.
Trinity who have a good side will have to adopt a positive approach if they are to bring about a result. Then in the Plate competition Vidyartha will play DS Senanayake at Nittawela and St. Anthony’s will scrum down with Maliyadeva at Digana grounds.
