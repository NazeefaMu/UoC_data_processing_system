Beeralu lace-makers face losses

Beeralu lace-makers in Hambantota said that their work had incurred losses due to the lack of state funds.
Thread costs were spiking and there was no proper market for products, they added.
They urged authorities to resolve the issue immediately as the South was at the forefront of the industry.
