Lady bereft of fear

It is a few days since I watched the film. I am not a film critic yet I feel that I have a duty by the film industry in Sri Lanka that I pen my thoughts and feelings down on watching the film. Hence I assume that I must be struck by it enough to want to do so.
The film starts with the main character engaged in manual work. He, along with us, listens to a reading of a book on traditional values allotted to a ‘good woman’. ‘She should be this’, ’she should not be this’ kind of narration with constant punctuations by the listener, creating somewhat a comic effect.
Then comes the part where the two men arrive at a hospital in order to bring back a dead body of a woman ’Suddi’ by name. The relation of the men to the women is not revealed though it is obvious that they are adamant to take the corpse home as cheaply as possible. Scenes connected to this is full of realism, though some such as the scene where the main character is left with the dead woman, and he uncovers the body instigates in us a surge of questions, making us participate in the experience.
Male behaviour
The return journey is long, one would feel. Yet the handling of it is such that it does contribute to the unravelling of the story. The scenery surrounding the journey is spectacular, the peaceful lush greenery of the mountains, the occasional boutiques is so realistically portrayed that one is made to feel the tranquillity of the atmosphere. The very ‘maleness’ of the behaviour of the three men in a close relationship through the journey and the comradeship they seem to share in their behaviour, their conversation and the jokes they share is amusing and entertaining.
This is in stark reality to the magic realism of the occasional scenes inserted in between. The occasions where flashbacks as well as the scenes where Suddi, the corpse talks reveal the connection of the past to the present and assists the spectator to understand many that were ‘unsaid’.... such as her marriage to a man considerably older than her expecting acceptance and security, how her very attractiveness became her traitor, the ways of the village and the irony of the female victim becoming the perpetrator. The experiences and accusations compelling her to leave her home and come to the ‘big city’.
Consequently how she becomes one of the many ‘girls’ how had joined the trade for multiple reasons. Her ultimate destiny of becoming a commodity that has value as an object of fun or a victim of fantasy and frustration of males. The ignorance of the ‘girl child’ of the facts of life and the humbling force of necessity making her face the ugly cruelty and perils of a world without compassion or sympathy.
Pay respect!
Yet it is constantly reminded that ‘Suddi’ should be treated with respect. This is the ugly face of the society which hurts and condemns a person while living but is quick to ‘honour’ the same once one is dead. The village waits for the corpse of Suddi to be brought back -No doubt to ‘pay respect’ to the corporeal, short of memory of how they had crushed her spirit, making her life unbearable.
It is at the end that the identity of her husband is revealed. It was the person who showed extreme anxiety of bringing her ‘home’ with respect. Yet the real end presents a thundering revelation. That is the fact that, though he is her husband he had not seen her naked body before! The statement poses many questions of sex and sexuality at the personal and the social level. Had she passively endured life in the unit of family and village, would she have been respected as a ‘good woman’? Would she have found happiness and fulfilment?
Many could present various arguments. Yet the question will remain up to discussion.
Irony mixes with sarcasm in the glaring fact that in the cultural context sex is taboo to women. Sex education is not provided in a systematic manner even school. Yet they are the ones who are expected to work it. it is with the cynicism that one is made to realise that respect gained through chastity while enjoyment is gained otherwise, through the ones who are condemned in society. In this case, the ‘respect’ that Nimalasiri insists on is thought-provoking. Though being an ignorant uneducated villager, has he concluded that Suddi is innocent and chaste in mind and spirit, despite the knowledge of the type of work she did in the big city?
Victim’s scream
The meaning of the number ‘28’ is said to refer to the menstrual period of the female. And it is refreshingly noted that there are no sex scenes inserted as a mode of entertainment. Nor is there violence. This is evident in the fact that although Suddi does not die naturally. She had met with an extremely violent death may be at the hands of one of her customers. The incident is not displayed on the screen but the sobbing and screaming of the victim in the background regarding her death says it all.
The spectator, without actually seeing the scene, is made to participate in the eye of the mind and visualise it in imagination. The device is obviously very effective. I am reminded of the manner how the Classical tragedians in ancient Greek drama refrained from depicting violence on stage. According to them, the reason is that the scenes would offend the refined people. The scenes described on stage or background sound effect would enable the audience to participate and even experience the action.
I also commend the cast and the crew for a job well done. It is their commitment I feel that the film had been so effective. Semini’s serene face evokes many emotions in the onlooker. She uses her expression well, according to the situation she describes. Mahendra, Rukmal and Jayasiri the threesome who engage in the journey through their realistic acting enlivens the pathos of the saga partly amidst comic relief. The film is thought-provoking while it is entertaining. But the final statement of Nimalasiri is a masterstroke.
