Inclement weather to prevail: Meteorological Department

The prevailing windy conditions are expected to worsen within the island and around the sea areas during the next few days, while the ongoing showers and cloudy conditions in the South Western regions would also continue further, the Meteorological Department said yesterday.
Accordingly, showers or thundershowers would occur at times in the Western, Southern, Sabaragamuwa, Central and North Western provinces, while fairly heavy rainfalls above 75 mm could be expected in some areas, particularly in the Western, Sabaragamuwa and Central provinces.
The Meteorological Department further stated that showers or thundershowers may also occur in a few places in the Ampara, Badulla and Batticaloa districts after 2. 00 p.m., with a possibility of light showers in the Anuradhapura district.
Fairly strong winds up to 50 kmph could be expected over the Southern Province as well as the Moneragala, Matale, Nuwara Eliya and Polonnaruwa districts.
Naval and fishing communities were also advised to be vigilant during the next few days, starting from June 6, due to the active South West Monsoon. Windy conditions at sea are expected to strengthen during the next few days.
Showers or thundershowers would occur at several places in sea areas extending from Mannar to Hambantota via Colombo and Galle.
Sea areas extending from Puttalam to Kankesanthurai via Mannar and the sea area extending from Matara to Pottuvil via Hambantota, could be rough at times, as wind speeds could increase up to 60 kmph.
Other sea areas could be fairly rough at times, as wind speeds could increase up to 50 kmph. Winds would be Westerly or South Westerly in direction within sea areas around the island, while wind speeds would be in the range of 35 to 45 kmph.
