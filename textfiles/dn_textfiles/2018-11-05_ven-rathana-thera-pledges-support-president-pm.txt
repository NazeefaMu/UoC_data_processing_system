Ven. Rathana Thera pledges support to President, PM

Parliamentarian Ven.Athuraliye Rathana Thera yesterday expressed his full support to President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Ven. Rathana Thera added that he will cast his vote for the President and the new Government to ensure the stability of the country.
He made these observations at a press briefing held yesterday morning in Colombo.
Rathana Thera urged that Parliament be dissolved as soon as possible, so that it will ensure democracy and allow an opportunity for people to express their support.
He said the current government should first establish a proper electoral system before going into an election.
“We believe that this present government under Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa shows much potential. So we request to continue the Government for three months until an electoral system is introduced to do away with preferential voting system.”
“I agree with President Sirisena’s decision and request that Parliament be dissolved at the earliest possible opportunity. I also request Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, to give the necessary support to dissolve Parliament,” Rathana Thera observed.
