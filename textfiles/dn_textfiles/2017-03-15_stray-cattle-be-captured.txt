Stray cattle to be captured

The Megapolis and Western Development Ministry had requested dairy owners in the Western Province to ensure that their cattle are tethered in grazing land safely without allowing them to stray into public places in search of fodder.
The ministry said this request is made because straying cattle have caused many problems in the province including inconveniencing the public, traffic accidents, obstruction to places of business as well as traffic congestion. A recent survey on obstacles to development under the Western Megapolis Development programme had identified straying cattle as one of the obstacles for the implementation of the programme.
The main cause for this had been the severe limitation of grazing land due to the proliferation of industries and other construction work in the region in recent times.
