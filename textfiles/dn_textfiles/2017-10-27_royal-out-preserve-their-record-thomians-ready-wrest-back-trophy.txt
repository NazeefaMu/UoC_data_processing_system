Royal out to preserve their record, but  Thomians ready to wrest back the trophy


The annual 48th Royal-Thomian Boat Race and the 44th Regatta will be worked off on October 28 at Colombo Rowing Club, commencing at 1.p.m. The traditional Boat Race is considered the most prestigious boat contest in Sri Lankan school history and inaugurated in 1962 as a 1000yards competition. Royalists won the inaugural Boat Race and what began as an annual event later went on to become a much loved tradition in both schools.
The Boat Race is a ‘5-man’ event, usually rowed by the most experienced and fittest oarsmen of the two schools. The winners will walk away with the Royal Thomian Boat Race Trophy, also known as the ‘Crossed Oars’ among the rowing fraternity. The Boat Race is the most prominent event in the regatta as it offers 12 points (highest for an individual event) for the overall championship.
The Royal-Thomian Regatta was introduced four years later in 1966 with a line up of six events. The regatta is the oldest inter-school regatta in Sri Lanka and also the third oldest sporting encounter between Royal College and S. Thomas’ College, lining up behind the Battle of the Blues Cricket Encounter and Rugby Encounter. At present the regatta includes seven events, offering 40 points divided among them.
The two prominent schools possess a great sporting history where as rowing was introduced to Royal College in 1953, making Royal the first Lankan school to do so. Thomians stepped into rowing few years later and continued with traditional rivalry with their arch rivals. The overall winner of the Regatta is awarded the T. Noel Fernando Memorial Trophy while trophies will be awarded to each and every event category winners of the regatta.
Royal rowing captain Hashen Hettigoda said: “The entire team is motivated and committed and is in complete anticipation to compete and win the ‘Roy-Tho Regatta’. Training was different this year compared to last year, so in terms of preparation it was different to 2016. We had three coaches last year and two coaches this year but the intensity of training was the same. We also had a new trainer who is really training us hard with the use of new techniques and we look forward positively towards the Saturday’s big event”.
Thomian rowing skipper Arjun Wickramanayake went on to say that they have been training very hard since the beginning of 2017 for this Regatta and it has been quite a challenge for them to strike a balance between their studies and commitment towards training. “This year we have a good mix of freshers and senior rowers that formed a well balanced team and we are ready for Saturday’s challenge” Arjun explained.
Ried Avenue school will be the favourites for this year’s crown as they have recorded two back-to-back thumping victories in the recent past. Royal won the regatta in 2015 by 48-4 points which was the biggest margin and broke that record in 2016 to emerge victorious by scoring 50 points against only 2 points by St. Thomas’ College.
Royal rowing team’s this year’s performance won them several titles including Ranfer Regatta (beating Colombo Rowing Club and STC), Over 18 overall at nationals (against Forces) and several club trophies (Gordan Armstrong ,Vanlangenberg, RCYC and Herman Sirimanne and V. A. Julius)
