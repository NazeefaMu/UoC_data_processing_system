GMOA calls for probe on Former Health Minister

Proper investigation should be conducted immediately on how the former Health Minister’s henchmen, including a male nurse, acquired lands worth over Rs. 150 million in Nugegoda and went on foreign tours using state funds, the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the former Health Minister gave regular foreign tours to his henchmen in NGOs naming them as trade union leaders.
He monthly pumped over Rs. 250 million to the Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital, which is still a private hospital. This should be investigated, Dr. Aluthge said.
The former Health Minister engaged in acts of corruption and malpractice when granting tenders, stating that he reduced drug prices. He gave free lenses and stents creating a monopoly in the market, which gave a huge profit to one specific private company.
The former Health Minister gained direct and indirect benefits by violating the Medical Ordinance and ignoring the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), Dr. Aluthge said.
Those acts of corruption and malpractice of the former Health Minister need to be investigated properly as soon as possible before the evidence disappears, he said.
