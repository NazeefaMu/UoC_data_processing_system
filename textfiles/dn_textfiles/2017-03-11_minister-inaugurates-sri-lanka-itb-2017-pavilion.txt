Minister inaugurates Sri Lanka  ITB 2017 Pavilion

The Sri Lanka Pavilion at the International Tourism Exhibition ITB 2017 in Berlin, Germany, was inaugurated on March 8 with the participation of Tourism Development Minister John Amaratunga.
Senior members of German Bundestag Jürgen Klimke and Michael Donth, Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau Chairman P.M. Withana, Sri Lankan Ambassador to Germany Karunatilaka Amunugama and several other business leaders from the global and Sri Lankan tourism industry participated.
Minister John Amaratunga invited the German counterparts to guide and to work closely with the Ministry and the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau.
Bundestag member Klimke said Sri Lanka is a “rare and grand example for peace building and political stability” in the world. He said the boom of the tourism industry was especially great to observe, as it went hand in hand with the process of reconciliation in the island. His colleague Donth commended the Sri Lankan tourism industry for its great performance and wished the tourism in Sri Lanka all the best for its future development.
Ambassador Amunugama thanked the German Government for its support to strengthen economic cooperation and requested German and Sri Lankan tourism professionals to develop strong partnerships to enhance visitor numbers from Europe.
With more than 150 representatives of the Sri Lankan tourism industry, the Sri Lanka Pavilion is one of the major attractions of the ITB 2017, the biggest exhibition of the tourism industry worldwide. More than 10,000 exhibitors from 184 regions and nations exhibit the actual trends and developments in the tourism industry. More than 180,000 visitors are expected to visit the ITB 2017 until March 12. With several structures and images reminding the visitors of the landscapes and buildings of Sri Lanka, including a live water fall, a tea bar with pure Ceylon tea available for the visitors and other attractions, the Sri Lanka Pavilion offers visitors every opportunity to experience the feeling of a real Sri Lankan holiday. The Sri Lanka Pavilion was organised by the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau along with the Embassy of Sri Lanka in Berlin.
The Minister met the German Economic Cooperation and Energy Minister and German Travel Industry personnel, German media as well as the Sri Lankan industry leaders in German.
