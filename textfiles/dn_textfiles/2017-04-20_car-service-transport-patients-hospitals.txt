Car service to transport patients in hospitals

The first motor car service to transport patients was launched at the Ampara General Hospital by Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne recently, Health Ministry sources said.
Cars similar to the vehicle used in airports to transport passengers to and from aircraft will replace trolleys in hospitals, the sources said.
The car which has a bed and all modern facilities will be used to transport patients in critical conditions to and from theatres. It has a roof but not a body, the sources said.
According to the sources, the service was launched as a pilot project. The ministry will consider the possibility of expanding the service to the other state hospitals where space is available to operate the service.
