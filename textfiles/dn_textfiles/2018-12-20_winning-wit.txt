Winning with Wit!

Sri Lanka’s worst ever constitutional crisis came to an end last week after a 51-day stand-off between the Executive and the Legislature that brought the country’s government to a virtual halt. The impasse was resolved after the intervention of the Judiciary, with a verdict from the Supreme Court.
The crisis was triggered when President Maithripala Sirisena, on October 26, decided to remove Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and appoint former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to the post instead. Wickremesinghe’s removal and Rajapaksa’s swearing-in took the country by utter surprise.
That there were significant differences of opinion between the President and his Prime Minister was well known. However, President Sirisena’s moves to summarily sack his Prime Minister were unexpected, even though they were preceded by a series of discussions with the Joint Opposition (JO).
The President’s decision was based on the premise that, once Rajapaksa is installed as Prime Minister, the JO together with the other factions of the United Peoples’ Freedom Alliance (UPFA) would be in a position to easily negotiate cross-overs of United National Party (UNP) parliamentarians.
Wickremesinghe’s dismissal
It was to allow this that President Sirisena prorogued Parliament on October 27, a day after Wickremesinghe’s dismissal. The prorogation, which attracted protests from the opposition, was until November 16, allowing UPFA and JO negotiators almost three weeks to negotiate with UNP MPs.
However, this is where the UPFA was caught napping. Its negotiators led by S.B. Dissanayake who mediated between the President and the Rajapaksa faction of the UPFA did not do their homework properly. They got their numbers wrong. There simply weren’t enough UNPers willing to cross-over.
A recorded telephone conversation between Dissanayake and UNP parliamentarian Range Bandara, where the latter’s cross-over was solicited also went viral on social media generating disgust and ridicule. This would have been a deterrent to any other UNPers who were considering crossing over.
The UPFA also underestimated the public backlash against the President’s actions in dismissing Wickremesinghe, appointing Rajapaksa and proroguing Parliament.
Also facing international and local censure, President Sirisena then announced Parliament’s prorogation will end on November 14.
Negotiations between the UPFA and selected opposition MPs then intensified. The objective was to secure their support for Rajapaksa as Prime Minister, so he could demonstrate he had the endorsement of at least 113 MPs in the House, a requirement under Article 42(4) of the Constitution.
As these discussions progressed, it became apparent to the UPFA leadership that they did not have the support of a majority of MPs. Faced with the prospect of Rajapaksa being rejected by Parliament if it was reconvened, President Sirisena dissolved Parliament on November 9, calling a general election.
On the next working day, Monday, November 12, twelve fundamental rights applications were filed in the Supreme Court, challenging the President’s decision to dissolve Parliament. This was based on Article 70(1) of the Constitution which precludes dissolution before four and a half years.
Other opposition parties including the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) and the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) were steadfast in their support to the UNP in this exercise. Also filing an application was Prof. Ratnajeevan Hoole, one of the members of the independent Elections Commission.
On the following day, November 13, the Supreme Court granted an interim order until December 7, staying the President’s proclamation dissolving Parliament. It was a landmark decision and paved the way for subsequent events by allowing Parliament to continue sittings until the matter was decided.
Parliament met the next day and passed a motion of no confidence against Rajapaksa. Over the next few days, as successive votes were passed against Rajapaksa and his purported Cabinet, behaviour in Parliament descended to unprecedented depths with UPFA MPs resorting to violence and vandalism.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya was prevented from taking his seat which was dragged away and had water poured on it. Chilli powder was flung at UNP MP Jayawickrema Perera. Chairs were thrown about and MP Prasanna Ranaweera assaulted a Police officer. This conduct dented the UPFA’s image badly.
Other battles were being fought in court. On December 3, the Court of Appeal issued an interim order restraining Rajapaksa and his Cabinet from functioning until the hearing of a writ of quo warranto filed against them is concluded. This was another setback for the UPFA’s plans to set up government.
The restraining order meant that effectively, there was no government in the country and all matters would have to be dealt with directly by the President. With the next date of hearing set for January 2019, it would have made the nation ungovernable, especially with no Budget being passed for 2019.
Supreme Court decision
In public, however, President Sirisena and Prime Minister Rajapaksa were maintaining a positive outlook. Also, some in government circles were still hopeful that the Supreme Court would hold in their favour. If they did, it would have triggered a general election and ended the crisis.
President Sirisena meanwhile continued having a series of discussions with the UPFA as well as Speaker Jayasuriya and the United National Front (UNF). However, he insisted that he would not reappoint Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister ‘even if all 225 MPs in Parliament endorsed him”.
The much-awaited Supreme Court decision was not delivered on December 7 but delayed by a few days. It came on December 13 when a seven-judge bench unanimously decided that the President’s decision to dissolve Parliament was unconstitutional, illegal and therefore, null and void.
Although this signalled the end of the ill-fated ‘constitutional coup’ for many, the Rajapaksa camp was still expectant. They were hoping that the interim restraining order granted by the Court of Appeal would be vacated by the Supreme Court. The court refused to do so on December 14.
That was the final nail in the coffin for the UPFA. On the following day, December 15, Rajapaksa resigned as Prime Minister stating he did not wish for the country to remain anarchic until January. The opposition, however, claimed that he had already foregone his post, losing support in Parliament.
Reappointed Prime Minister
On Sunday, December 16, Ranil Wickremesinghe was reappointed Prime Minister and took his oaths before President Sirisena who had to back down from his previous stance that he would never re-appoint Wickremesinghe. He was to say he did so out of respect for parliamentary traditions.
While the main political drama enacted over fifty-one days has now come to an end, the major players are reviewing recent events with an eye on the future, especially as presidential elections are due by January 2020 and general elections have to be held by August 2020 at the very latest.
While President Maithripala Sirisena has attracted much criticism for his ill-advised actions, he has attempted to explain them, stating he acted in good faith, based on legal advice provided to him by eminent counsel. Nevertheless, it is clear that the past seven weeks did not enhance his popularity.
The other big loser in this exercise was Mahinda Rajapaksa. He was riding the crest of a wave of popular support when this crisis unfolded. By accepting the Premiership and then by trying to stay in the office using strong-arm tactics in Parliament, he has lost much of the goodwill he enjoyed previously.
The big winner is the UNF and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe. Weighed down by the burdens of incumbency, it was sliding in the popularity stakes. Its stance on this issue and its fight for democratic principles has boosted its morale, united its factions and enhanced its standing among voters.
Yet, there is still more than a year for the next national elections. As the past seven weeks have shown, a year can be a very long time in politics. It is now up to the UNF to deliver on its promises- or else, it too will be judged harshly by the voter- just as the UPFA was, in the past few weeks.
