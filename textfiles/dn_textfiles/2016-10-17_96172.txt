Sri Lanka who finished second in the first two legs thus had to be satisfied with fourth place with China taking third spot.
Sri Lanka at one point led 21-7 but conceded the game in the last two minutes allowing the Chinese to run in three consecutive tries.
At half time Sri Lanka were ahead 14-7 and their loss in the dying moments of the game came as a shock to all their supporters.
Sri Lanka scored their tries through scrum half Richard Dharmapala, fly half Srinath Sooriyabandara and winger Danushka Ranjan. All three conversions were put over by Kevin Dixon (2) and Sooriyabandara (1).
For the winning Chinese team the tries were scored by Changshun Shan, Chao Zhang, Shuoshuo Wang and Wenru Feng. The solitary conversion was put over by Jianhua Wang.
In the semi-finals Sri Lanka lost to Hong Kong by 19 points (3 tries, 2 conversions) to 7 (1 try, 1 conversion). Hong Kong ran circles around the hapless Sri Lankans who did not have any answer to the onslaught carried out by them.
Sri Lanka’s solitary try was scored by forward Dansha Dayan in the very first minute of the game from the kick off. Dulaj Perera slotted in the conversion.
For the winners the tries were scored by Max Woodward (two) and Salom Yiu KamShing (one). The two conversions were put over by fly half Benjamin Rimene.
Hong Kong went onto crown themselves Cup champions for the third consecutive time in the series when they beat South Korea 24-19 in the final. In the last move
Hong Kong won when replacement forward Christopher Maize touched down for a try near the right corner flag after collecting an off load from winger Jason Jeyam who made the break and ran nearly 40 metres side stepping several Korean defenders after the scores were deadlocked at 19-all. For Hong Kong the tries were scored by Benjamin Rimene (two) and Jason Jeyam (one). Rimene slotted in two conversions. For the Koreans the tries were scored by Yong Heung Chang (two) and Hang Yul Park (one).
