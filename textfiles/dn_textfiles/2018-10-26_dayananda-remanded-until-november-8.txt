Abduction of youths in 2009
Dayananda remanded until November 8

The Colombo Chief Magistrate's Court yesterday ordered Lieutenant Commander Sampath Dayananda to be remanded till November 8.
Dayananda was previously attached to the Welisara Navy Camp as a Naval Intelligence Officer. He was arrested for allegedly abducting two Kotahena residents, Vadivelu Pakkili Sami Loganathan and Rathnasami Paramanandan, in 2009.
Police initiated investigations into the disappearance of Loganathan and Paramanandan on the instructions of the then Inspector General of Police, following a complaint made by the then Navy Commander Wasantha Karannagoda in 2009.
The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) had informed Court that the van owned by Vadivelu Loganathan was found at the Welisara Navy Camp, while it was being discarded after being cut into 72 pieces.
