Chinese PM to open Water Research Laboratory project in July

Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang will inaugurate the Water Research Laboratory project in July this year. The project is to cost USD 20 million, with the Peradeniya University, Urban Development, Water Supply and Drainage Board collaborating, Minister Rauff Hakeem said.
According to Minister Hakeem, for the first time in Sri Lanka, sea (salt) water will be desalinated and provided for the people to drink.
“The cheapest method will be used to clean sea water,” Minister Hakeem said. The Minister was addressing the World Water Day celebration at the Neum Pokuna in Colombo yesterday.
Minister Hakeem said that it is expected to increase the pipe borne water supply up to 60 percent by 2020 at a cost of Rs. 300 million through the implementation of several drinking water supply projects countrywide.
Half of those projects will be allocated for the areas where the Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Origin (CKDU) is most prevalent. The Water Board has already commenced several projects that were not implemented in the past,” the Minister said.
Minister Hakeem said that a `Water Footprint’ is to be legally introduced to Sri Lanka soon and until then all Sri Lankan industrialists, manufacturers can voluntarily follow it. It is similar to the `Carbon Footprint’.
“This system will improve waste water management treatment etc,” Minister Hakeem said.
Awards were presented to the winners of several competitions held to mark World Water Day. Several cultural items were presented
during the ceremony.
