‘Govt. won’t sell or lease Eastern Terminal of Colombo Port’

The government would not sell or lease even an inch of the Eastern Terminal of the Colombo Port, said President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday.
The President gave this assurance to the workers of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority, addressing the 38th anniversary of Sri Lanka Port Authority (SLPA). The event was held at the SLPA premises.
He also appreciated the workers, both working and the retired, for their contribution to make the Colombo Port to the present standard on par with the world’s best ports, with sophisticated technology and facilities.
He also said that the Government would also assure that the lands would not be given outright to foreigners, but only on lease.
“There are many criticisms against the Hambantota Harbour agreement,” said President Maithripala Sirisena. “But in fact the agreement was drafted on September 3 or 4 in 2014 during the previous government in which I was a Cabinet minister. So I know it better and there were clauses far worse to the country than what we have inked.”
He also said he could reduce the extension of the lands that were proposed by the previous government by 50 percent. He added that the clauses were included to execute the operations of the Harbour under the laws of the country with the supervision of the Sri Lanka Navy.
“On the other hand, I also instructed to include the clause that we should be able amend the clauses of the agreement in future if there are clauses that affect the country. None of such agreements were presented before the Parliament during the previous regime, but now, it has changed,” he said.
Whatever the criticisms levelled against the Government, the previous government gave six acres in Gall Face outright to Shangri-La. It had proposed to grant 240 acres of the Colombo Port City to China, but we changed it into a lease.
He also said that some persons attempt to topple the government. “But they can’t do it for another three years.
They have to do it, if possible, at the next election. Now we have brought about peace and equality and guaranteed other rights. So they can use them and win at the next election,” President Sirisena added.
