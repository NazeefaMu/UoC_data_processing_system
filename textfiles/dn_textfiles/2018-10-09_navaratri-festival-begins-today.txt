Navaratri festival begins today

The annual Navaratri festival will take place from October 9 – 19.
The word ‘Navaratri’ means ‘nine auspicious nights’ and celebrations are held in honour of the Hindu Goddesses Durga, Lakshmi and Saraswati.
The nine nights symbolise the three avatars of the Devi in the forms of Durga, Lakshmi and Saraswati. In other words, Malai Magal, Alai Magal and Kalai Magal. Malai Magal means Durga Ma (Mother Durga) who bestows courage and grants victory.
This festival begins between the end of September and beginning of October. The second three days are in honour of Sri Mahalakshmi: the Goddess of Wealth. The last three days are dedicated to Maha Saraswati: the Goddess of Education, Art and Music.
During the festival, nine varieties of grains are planted and most devotees fast. Idols of the three goddesses are kept at pooja sites called kolu vaithal. The 10th day of this festival is known as the Vijayadashami, on which an auspicious time is selected to teach children the alphabet. The Navaratri festival is mostly celebrated in India, Malaysia, Singapore and Sri Lanka.
Devotees take part in religious rites and sing bhakthi geetha, as well as offer sweets, fruits and flowers to the goddesses.
