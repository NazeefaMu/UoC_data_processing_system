Girls above 10 years to be vaccinated against HPV

 
All Sri Lankan girls aged above 10 will be vaccinated against the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) Health Ministry spokesman said.
 According to the spokesman, the vaccine will be included in the National Immunization Programme from July 3 this year and it will be injected to all school girls starting from grade six.
Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne decided to include the vaccine in the programme with the intention of eradicating cervical cancer from Sri Lanka.
‘There are only two ways of preventing cervical caner. The first and successful method is obtaining the vaccine against Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) and the second method is subjecting to cancer screening (PAP Smear Test) regularly. 
Meanwhile MBBS, MD, Dip. RT, Consultant in Clinical Oncology and Radiotherapy Dr. Mahendra Perera said that the vaccine will prevent more than 85 percent of Cervical Cancer in women. 
He said that cervix cancer is the 2nd common cancer in females in Sri Lanka and it is mostly detected at Stage 3 which is a very advanced stage and which is not completely curable.
Once detected in early stages, it is curable either by surgery or Chemo-Radiotherapy Dr. Mahendra Perera added.
