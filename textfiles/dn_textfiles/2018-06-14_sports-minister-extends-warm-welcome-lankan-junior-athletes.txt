Sports Minister extends warm  welcome to Lankan Junior athletes

The Sri Lankan athletes who won fifth place for Sri Lanka with a medal bag of three gold, four silver and two bronze at the recently concluded Asian Junior Athletics Championship in Japan was given a warm welcome at the Bandaranaike International Airport special guests entrance by Sports Minister Faiszer Musthapa and officials of his Ministry on their arrival to the country.
The Sports Minister praised the medal winners as their achievements came from competing against 45 nations. "It is a great triumph that out of 13 participants, Sri Lanka has won nine medals. We have planned a long term program to train these athletes under top class coaches and bring them to Olympic level. We see a big difference in the outcome of the Commonwealth Games where 83 athletes took part and in this event where only 13 participated. We hope to select the best and provide all facilities to them in order to achieve international level targets," the Sports Minister said.
