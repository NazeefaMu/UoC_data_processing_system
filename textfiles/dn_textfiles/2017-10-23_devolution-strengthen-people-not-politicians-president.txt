Devolution to strengthen people, not politicians: President

Power should be devolved to strengthen the people and cater to their needs rather than to strengthen politicians. The main objective of devolution of power is to ensure dividends of development and facilities to everyone on an equal basis, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
The President made this observation addressing the concluding ceremony of the Janapathi Nila Mehewara Presidential Mobile Service at the Saivapragasa Balika Vidyalaya, Vavuniya on October 21.
The President who observed that the present government was committed to undertake development work and political reforms needed for the country, added that it was natural to encounter opposition in implementing that programme.
“Those opposing political reforms should act with a clear understanding of the reality of the urgent problems confronting the country today. They should bear responsibility for any future problems encountered due to the non solution of present day problems,” the President said.
“The irony was that people who criticised and protested against this programme had no proposals of their own for solving those problems,” President Sirisena said.
The President said he would request all of them to forward proposals regarding the urgent political reforms the country needed. The Steering Committee report tabled in Parliament for debate and incorporating the ideas and views of all had clearly mentioned the unitary status of the country, pre-eminent position given to Buddhism and a society with harmony and equality among people.
President Sirisena who said that certain people were trying to create a wrong public impression by highlighting facts not included in the Steering Committee report said that certain sections of the media including certain newspapers were publishing false and fabricated news items to mislead the people.
The President requested all of them to act by identifying their responsibility by the nation.
The Nila Mehewara Presidential Mobile Service programme had concluded 63 regional programmes. The programme held recently and centred on the Vavuniya District was the third national level programme.
This programme conducted by the Home Affairs Ministry had successfully conducted national level programmes in the Polonnaruwa and Galle districts.
Distribution of 5,000 title land deeds to people without title deeds to their lands in the district, prizes for students with the highest marks in the Grade 5 Scholarship Examination, coconut seedlings offered by the Coconut Development Board, bottled water for people encountering drinking water problems and handing over of two water bowzers were made under the patronage of President Sirisena at this ceremony.
The President who went on an observation tour of the mobile service premises paid attention to the people’s problems.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Ministers Vajira Abeywardena, S.B. Nawinna and Rishard Bathiutheen, State Minister Vijayakala Maheswaran Northern Province Governor Reginald Cooray, Parliamentarian K. Cader Masthan, A.M. Sumanthiran and Selvam Adailalanadan wee also present on the occasion.
