To meet growing demands of the conference and wedding market, White Heaven Hotel, Panadura, is investing to enhance their banquet and conference facilities.
The hotel’s Director Madushan Silva said that today they offer the biggest conference facilities outside Colombo with four different banquet halls offering over 3,500 covers. “The Kings Hall accommodates 450, Queens, 400 and both Prince and Princess could accommodate nearly 800. In addition, we have two other open spaces which could be used for parties and special events. The large garden area could host outdoor events to cater to over 1,500.”
He said that a new lighting system was installed recently and this has been well received by guests. “We will have new multimedia facilities to cater to the conference market as well.”
The hotel offers a large swimming pool and 32 rooms and a large restaurant. “Our main market is Russia and the Ukraine and we also have guests from other European countries. We offer airport pick up and drop and excursions to all parts of Sri Lanka.” (SS)
