JAT’s ‘Master Plaster’ eliminates sand usage and boosts construction

JAT Holdings, a leader in the furnishing and finishing industry has revolutionized Sri Lanka’s construction arena with its ‘Master Plaster’ all-in-one-solution, thereby totally eliminating the usage of sand in plastering. Thus besides being a unique product, and supremely cost effective, it also ensures the conservation of scarce natural resources such as sand.
“In keeping with JAT’s ‘Green Policy,’ ‘Master Plaster’ respects the boundaries set by global environmental protection regulations which frown upon the excavation, transportation and usage of river sand in the building industry. Sand mining has immense long-term negative effects on the environment. With the introduction of Master Plaster, we eliminate this issue and offer an easier, cheaper and environmentally friendly product”, said Managing Director of JAT Holdings Aelian Gunawardene.
The conventional manner of constructing walls is to use bricks or blocks and finish with coats of plaster done through a process of sand-cement plastering using POP/putty pruning. Now, with a single, direct coat application of ‘Master Plaster,’ this costly and archaic two process method of plastering has been eliminated, affording optimum, cost effective results.
“As the leader in Sri Lanka’s furnishing and finishing industry, we’re very happy to introduce this revolutionary product which will dramatically change the face of the industry. This is a high performance, cost effective and environmentally friendly product which offers new possibilities and takes the concept of plastering to the next level and thus to international standards. I have no doubt that this product will be accepted by thousands of masons across Sri Lanka and help them in their daily operations”, Gunawardene added.
The revolutionary cutting edge technology of ‘Master Plaster’ guarantees a staggering 70% saving in both time and cost by incorporating user-friendly innovation.
Its ready-mix configuration helps the simplest of masons to achieve the most professional of outcomes compared to the trial-by-error means adopted by traditional methods. The elastic properties of ‘Master Plaster’ certify the complete elimination of hairline cracks which inevitably result from the sand-cement plastering method.
Yet another of the merits ‘Master Plaster’ boasts is its light weight properties when compared to sand cement, hence reducing the dead load on structures.
In keeping with JAT’s Occupational Health and Safety safeguards, the fire-retardant composition of ‘Master Plaster’ makes it non-combustible thereby significantly reducing the risk of a loss of lives and property through accidental fire.
