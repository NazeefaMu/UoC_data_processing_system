World’s biggest animals

Lolong the crocodile
Lolong the saltwater crocodile, who died a few years ago, is thought to be the biggest of its kind ever in captivity, measuring 21ft in the Philippines.
The beast was blamed for several deadly attacks before his capture in 2011.
His body was preserved so villagers could still see the reptile, as he was adored by the locals.
Knickers the cow

Knickers the cow shocked the world recently after pictures of the enormous animal went viral.
The cow is too big to be killed, weighing 220 stone and standing at 6ft 4inches tall, so instead gets to live out his days roaming the fields in Western Australia.
But Knickers isn't alone in the over-sized animal club.
Check out some of these giant creatures who are breaking records for their stature....
Mystery chicken

A video of an enormous chicken went viral last year when it was filmed poking its head through a relatively small hole in an elevated hutch.
As the clip continues, the chicken begins to step into the yard and reveals its incredible enormity and plumage.
With masses of feathers and standing far taller than most dogs, the bird wanders around the yard marking its territory.
Samson the mighty Maine Coon

Weighing 28 pounds and measuring an incredible four-foot in length is this hulking feline. He spends his down time playing fetch and has now reached celebrity status due to his impressive stature, including more than 180,000 followers on Instagram.
Darius the rabbit

Darius the rabbit measured a total of 4 feet 4 inches long. It costs his owner a whopping £5,000 a year to feed her giant bunnies, who munch their way through 2,000 carrots and 700 apples every 12 months.
Every day each of them also chows down on a huge dog bowl full of specialist rabbit food, and a bale of hay a week.
Squirrel

The enormous grey squirrel has ballooned to twice its size after being repeatedly fed nuts by tourists visting the park where she lives.
Photographer Marina van der Linden captured the chubby creature on film in the Morro Rock State Preserve in California. Software engineer Marina, 46, was stunned when the obese California ground squirrel appeared after she pulled out a bag of nuts.
She said, "I had been in the park taking photos but couldn't get any clear pictures because it was so foggy.
"I got out a bag of peanuts and suddenly I saw a family of squirrels. It was hilarious because they were all quite big, but there was one that was enormous."
Sting ray

In 2015, TV host Jeff Corwin and veterinarian Nantarika Chansue examined a huge freshwater stingray in Thailand's Mae Klong River.
The ray was a record-breaker, and the catch and release was filmed for an episode of the ABC show Ocean Mysteries with Jeff Corwin.
The ray measured 7.9ft across and 14ft long, weighing an estimated 800lbs.
Bopper the dog

Bopper - nicknamed Bopper the Whopper - was taken in by the RSPCA when his owners became too unwell to look after him.
Now the poor pooch finds breathing and standing difficult because of his huge size. He tips the scales at 49.6kg when he should weigh around 27kg.
Gables Farm Dogs and Cats Home, in Plymouth, took Bopper in from the RSPCA but say he is too large to fit in any of their kennels.
