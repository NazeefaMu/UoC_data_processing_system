Defence Ministry refutes disabled soldiers' demands as unreasonable

A disabled war hero was receiving up to Rs. 70,000 monthly as a pension where a Government labourer was only receiving around 20,000 monthly as wages, Defence Ministry Additional Secretary, Sarath Kumara said.
Addressing a media briefing at the Defence Ministry yesterday, he said it was not clear what more the disabled soldiers wanted, as the government had fulfilled their demands.
Sarath Kumara requested the disabled war heroes to refrain from conducting protests that inconvenience the general public. "The disabled war heroes are invited to negotiate with the responsible authorities regarding their grievances," he added.
He said there were several disabled war heroes enjoying their full pension rights despite not having completed their minimum service period of 10 years.
The Additional Secretary said, “A total of Rs. 3,500 million was allocated for the expenditure of soldiers for the year 2017. By February, Rs. 250 Million of the allocated funds had already been paid to disabled war heroes. Therefore, allegations by war heroes about discrimination is unjustified, as they have been given priority.”
Sri Lanka Army Director Pay and Records, Brigadier Sanath Perera said the disabled soldiers receive a comprehensive monthly salary, disability pension and service pension for each month and it adds up to around Rs. 70,000.
He said, “Disabled soldiers will be remunerated each month similar to other tri force soldiers. Their salaries will also be increased gradually according to promotions they will be receiving if they were in active service despite not being eligible for promotion by designation.”
