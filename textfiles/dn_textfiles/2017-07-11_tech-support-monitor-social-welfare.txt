Tech support to monitor social welfare

The government has launched a new programme utilizing new technology to properly distribute social benefits to people.
Through the programme, people can easily access an electronic database which will provide information on all welfare benefits offered by the government.
The programme was initiated by the Policy Development Office of the Prime Minister’s Office. It is being implemented together with the Department of Project Management and Monitoring, and the Information Technology Agency of Sri Lanka (ICTA).
The public can obtain information about the areas in which projects are being implemented and how much money is spent. Data collection is still in the initial phase awaiting confirmation through the District and Divisional Secretaries.
The programme will provide accurate information about all welfare beneficiaries and provide a system to identify the people who are entitled to benefits to eliminate fraud and wastage ensuring transparency.
This is a source which carries island wide information on welfare projects and progress.
The public can access the webpage by going to http://socialregistry.gov.lk.
