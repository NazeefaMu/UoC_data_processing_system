Monk assaults student in Madolsima

A schoolboy who sustained severe injuries due to an assault on him by a monk who works for the school as a teacher has been admitted to hospital in Passara.
As the schoolboy hasn’t done his home work, the monk had assaulted him needing medical attention. The schoolboy, a grade six student, was admitted to the Passara Hospital with head injuries.
Police sources said the incident had happened last Friday in a school in Madugasthalawa in Passara.
Madolsima police had arrested the suspect monk following a complaint lodged by the guardians of the schoolboy with connection to this incident. The monk, a resident in a temple in Madugasthalawa in Passara was to be produced to Badulla Magistrate’s Court by the Madolsima Police.
