He said under the present government, international assistance for development work was flowing in.
“We were ignored by some powerful countries due to the shortsighted foreign policy of the previous government and now that position has changed. We have already started a series of development projects. Some of the opposition members may say in future that those projects were started by them,” the Minister said.
