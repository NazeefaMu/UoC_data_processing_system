President fulfills differently-abled student’s aspiration

President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday said he would grant an electric wheelchair to the student who obtained 3 A passes at the GCE (A/L) Examination 2017 in the Commerce stream.
The President instructed his officials to make arrangements to grant the chair very soon to P. M. Devin Indusara Rathnayake, who is differently-abled since his birth, but was clever enough to secure the island rank 48 in the Commerce stream.
He directed his officials to grant the wheelchair during the 40th anniversary celebration of the Science College in Mount Lavinia when Indusara was awarded as the 2017 most talented student in the school. Following a brief discussion with the student, the President instructed the officials to fulfill his aspiration to make his life easier.
President Sirisena said he would take steps to renovate the school playground on a request made during the ceremony.
Higher Education and Cultural Affairs State Minister Mohan Lal Grero speaking at the ceremony said the future of the school is decided on the discipline and the education of the students rather than on its material properties.
He said the students should be well-taught and disciplined for them to be good citizens. “Sri Lankan students are more creative,” State Minister Grero said. “Learning-by-heart culture has deviated them from using their inborn talent. Now we have reached a crucial juncture where we have to promote creativity in all aspects mainly on science and technology. It will drive the country forward along with the developed world,” he said.
Finance State Minister Eran Wickramaratne, UNP MP Hirunika Premachandra, Western Province Education, Culture and Arts, Sports and Youth Affairs and Information Technology Minister Ranjith Somawansa and Principal W. Susantha Mendis were present.
