Pepper industry vital to Lanka’s economy: President

Almost all countries including Sri Lanka depend on the contribution of the export agricultural sector to earn foreign exchange and increase foreign reserves. Pepper used as a food item, a medicine as well as a raw material for the perfume industry, has a great demand internationally, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
The pepper industry in Sri Lanka has systematically progressed and come to the forefront in recent times, he said.
The President made this observation addressing the inaugural 45th sessions of the International Pepper Community held at Earl's Regency Hotel, Kandy, yesterday.
The annual sessions and meetings are jointly organised by the Primary Industries Ministry and the Export Agriculture Department.
Welcoming the delegates attending the sessions, President Sirisena said delegates who attended the previous 44 sessions over the years would have gained a wealth of information regarding the industry. The pepper industry sector is a vital sector in the economy of Sri Lanka.
He said the pepper sector faced many challenges in trying to achieved its annual targets. Among them were climate change and plant diseases which threatened the industry.
Added to this, there were changes in market demand. Such challenges were common to other agricultural industries such as tea.
Problems had arisen in the re-export of pepper and tea after value addition, he said.
Pepper prices had been affected by the re-export industry. Prices had dropped sharply giving rise to marketing problems.
The government had intervened and held several rounds of talks to address these problems. Provision of high quality farm products including pepper enabled customers to purchase quality goods at affordable prices. They should all join hands to create the necessary background to ensure this, he said.
The President said the Primary Industries Minister had launched several projects to promote spice exports including pepper during the last two years.
"We in Sri Lanka lagging behind in export products in the international market. The state and private sectors as farmers should pay more attention towards increasing our agricultural exports," he said.
It was with this objective in view that the government recently launched a production drive two months ago. Emphasis had been laid on developing the pepper industry too under the production drive as well as the Grama Shakthi movement, he added. Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage and Ministry Secretary Bandula Wickramarachchi also spoke. Central Province Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake and International Pepper Community Executive Director Hoang Thi Lien were also present.
