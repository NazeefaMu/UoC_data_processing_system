'Sri Lankans lead the way on Oracle Cloud'

Sri Lankan Organisations increase agility, unify experiences and transform businesses with innovations from Oracle Cloud
At a recent media showcase event, three of Sri Lanka's most prominent companies discussed how they are using Oracle Cloud Applications to transform their businesses and capitalise on digital opportunities by building a complete cloud strategy harnessing SaaS applications.
The event participants learned how Oracle Cloud Applications help organisations drive innovation and business transformation by increasing business agility, lowering costs, and reducing IT complexity by showcasing Oracle Cloud - the industry's broadest and most integrated public cloud. Offering best-in-class services across Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), it also allows organisations to host Oracle Cloud in their own data center via Oracle's unique ‘Cloud at Customer’ offering.
“It is exciting to see companies in Sri Lanka at the forefront of using cloud to drive innovation and push boundaries,” said Chandita Samaranayake, Regional Director Oracle SAGE. “These organisations are using Oracle Cloud Applications to transform and modernise everything from customer experience to enterprise resource planning, human capital management and many more, making their business more personalised, connected, and secure.”
Leading Sri Lankan organisations including Etisalat Sri Lanka, Virtusa, and MAS shared details of the business benefits they continue to realise as a result of the transformational power of Oracle Cloud Applications.
“As we grow rapidly and in keeping in line with our vision of a world where people's reach is not limited by matter or distance, we were looking for a solution to simplify and modernise our business processes, providing a comprehensive view across the entire organisation with the ability to seamlessly integrate across multiple systems,” said Perihane Elhamy, chief technology and information officer at Etisalat. “With Oracle Cloud Applications, we will have the modern tools that will enable us to grow our business operations, simplify our existing business processes, and increase employee productivity through proper talent management.”
“Our people are the core of our business. To create an environment that enable us to deliver a truly world class experience for our global clients, it's essential that we provide our teams with a truly modern user experience that helps drive engagement, innovation and productivity,” said Madu Ratnayake, Executive Vice President, CIO and General Manager at Virtusa.
“This requires across-the-board business transformation. Gone are the days where finance's role was to just manage risk, execute transactions, and keep score, and HR was just about basic hiring and people management. Today, forward-thinking CFOs and CHROs are working together with their digital teams to create the modern digital business, and to provide best-in-class operations across all domains, so as to add value to the business and boost competitiveness.”
Director - Group Human Resources, MAS Holdings, Shakthi Ranatunga said: “We are pleased to partner with a highly acclaimed international service provider of the caliber of Oracle. We believe this partnership will strengthen the delivery of our HR strategy, especially as we continue our local and international expansions.”
The event also gave participants an insight into Oracle's uniquely comprehensive SaaS portfolio in delivering complete and integrated business processes, particularly Oracle Enterprise Resource Planning suite (ERP) Cloud and Oracle Human Capital Management (HCM) Cloud offering solutions. Mr. Samaranayake highlighted how Oracle ERP Cloud is the industry's most complete, modern, and proven financial platform delivered seamlessly through the Oracle Cloud. A modern user interface driven by the latest design innovations delivers embedded analytics, contextual social collaboration, and a device-independent mobile experience to make Oracle ERP Cloud simple and easy to use.
