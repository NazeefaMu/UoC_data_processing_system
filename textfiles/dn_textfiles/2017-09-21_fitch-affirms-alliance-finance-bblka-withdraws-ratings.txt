Fitch affirms Alliance Finance at BB+(lka); withdraws ratings

Fitch Ratings on Tuesday affirmed Alliance Finance Company PLC’s (AFC) National Long-Term Rating and the ratings on its outstanding senior unsecured debentures at ‘BB+(lka)’.
The Outlook on the National Long-Term Rating is Stable. Fitch has also affirmed AFC’s outstanding subordinated debentures at ‘BB(lka)’.
At the same time, Fitch has withdrawn all the ratings of AFC because they have been taken private.
