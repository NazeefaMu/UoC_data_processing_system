Ranil’s rally a flop

The eagerly awaited and the much hyped UNP protest rally which promised to show over 50,000 faces ended with only10,000 of its numbers turning out.
One of the protesters who came from Matara said that they attended the rally not to show solidarity to former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe but to look for a new leader. Ranil Wickremesinghe has once again showed that he is a failed leader and we do not want history to repeat itself again,” he said.He said the UNP was in the Opposition for a long period and once again they have been pushed into this position due to the weak leadership of Ranil Wickremesinghe. “We want a new leader like Sajith Premadasa to carry this party forward,” they said.
Another supporter from Colombo who attended this rally said they want Sajith Premadasa to lead them and they attended this rally to give this message. “Ranil Wickremesinghe at the last Party Convention said he would lead the UNP until 2030. “However if he remains for at least one year there won’t be a UNP for him to lead as it would be divided in to several fragments.”
