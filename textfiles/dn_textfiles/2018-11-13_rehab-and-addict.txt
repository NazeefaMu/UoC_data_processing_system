Rehab and the addict

The path to drug addiction begins with the voluntary act of using drugs and over time, a person’s ability to choose not to do so becomes compromised. Seeking and taking the drug becomes compulsive. According to medical experts, this is mostly due to the effects of long-term drug exposure on the function of the brain. Addiction affects parts of the brain involved with reward and motivation, learning and memory, and control over behaviour. This habit invariably leads to other anti-social activities to fund the addiction. In the end, most addicts end up behind bars.
This is not the ideal solution. This is a group of people whom society prefers to ignore and discard. However, based on a concept by the former Chairperson of the Dangerous Drugs Control Board, Leysha de Silva, the former government took steps to turn the Kandakadu ex-LTTE rehabilitation centre into a drug rehabilitation centre, around 2013.
Rehabilitation
While the ex-combatants were being released after rehabilitation and reintegrated into society, the facility run by military personnel attached to the Bureau of the Commissioner General of Rehabilitation was put to good use to rehabilitate these drug addicts.
At the time, many were sceptical as to its effectiveness and some even criticised the government accusing them of trying to militarise such institutions. There are many such drug rehabilitation centres throughout the country, and although many of them provide treatment, these drug addicts somehow get their hands on drugs even while in rehabilitation.
However, the Kandakadu and Senapura Drug Rehab Centres are run in accordance with military discipline and throughout their training the addicts are kept away from drugs. Even the staff members are thoroughly checked prior to entering the premises. Staff members are also not allowed to smoke cigarettes within the facility.
Despite the strict military discipline and training, the Commissioner General of Rehabilitation Major General Janaka Ratnayake and his Deputy, Brigadier Darshana Liyanage ensure that those who are undergoing the rehabilitation programme are treated with kindness and respect.
One may ask if rehabilitation is effective and can drug addiction be treated? Yes, but it’s not simple. Because addiction is a chronic disease, people can’t simply stop using drugs for a few days and be cured. Most patients need long-term or repeated care to stop using narcotics completely and recover their lives.
The main aim of this treatment programme is to ensure that these persons stop using drugs, stay drug-free, and be productive in the family, at work, and in society.
The drug addicts are brought to the substance-abuse rehabilitation centre in Kandakadu in the Eastern Province based on court orders. This is a positive sign that attitudes are slowly changing as the authorities begin to confront an uncomfortable problem that has long been ignored. In the past, drug addicts when brought before the courts were handed prison sentences. However, one of the biggest problems in combatting the drug menace in this country has been that prison is a haven for these addicts and there have been many instances where even prisoners who had never used drugs before had eventually come out of prison as addicts.
A new lease of life
During a recent visit to the facility, the Daily News spoke with some of the rehabilitants and staff about their treatment and the effectiveness of the programme. According to Maj. G.H. Nandasiri, there are around 1,066 drug addicts who are being rehabilitated at the Kandakadu facility and after six months of initial training which includes spiritual training, counselling, therapy, and meditation, they are then transferred to Senapura for the second leg of their rehabilitation, where they are given vocational training and skills development to help them find employment opportunities once they are reintegrated into society.
According to Maj. Nandasiri, the facilities in Kandakadu are insufficient to cater to the growing number of drug addicts who come there to be rehabilitated. However, he added that as a result of several appeals, the government has agreed to provide them several more permanent buildings and sanitary facilities. The facility is secured with double fencing and sentry points are set up around the facility where there is no possibility for anyone to escape.
“These rehabilitants have to follow military rules and their day is planned out for them. The daily routine starts with the hoisting of the national flag followed by PT from 6.00 am to 7.00 am. On some days, they have aerobics. Then they tidy up their living areas and have breakfast. The first session for the day commences at 9.00 am where they engage in cognitive therapy and other personality and self-confidence-building exercises. This ends at around 10.30 am. From 10.30 am to 11.00 am, they have a tea break.
Then from 11 am to 12.30 pm they have another session of leadership skills, personal development and soft skills development. From 12.30 pm to 2.30 pm, they are given a lunch break and from thereon, until 4.00 pm these rehabilitants engage in various activities such as music and other collective recreational activities. From 4.00 pm to 6.00 pm they engage in sports such as volleyball, football, cricket, badminton or use the gym for physical fitness. At 6.00 pm, they line up and a head count is taken to ensure that all are accounted for. After dinner at 7.00 pm, they either watch TV or read the newspapers. On Wednesdays, they are allowed to watch a musical programme and on another day a movie and so on, after which at 10.00 pm the lights are turned off and they must retire for the day, according to Lt. C.B. Atapattu.
There are around 70 staff members attending to the rehabilitants, including seven counsellors. They are all from the National Cadet Corps; all are teachers, but have been given military training. They wear civilian attire and have all undergone a one-year diploma and the National Dangerous Drugs Control Board certificate course in counselling. Hence, they have the requisite training and are suitable for the task. Their military background also helps them to instill discipline in the lives of the rehabilitants, who are required to have neat haircuts and shave, clip their nails and keep themselves clean, neat and tidy. The centre provides them all with clothing and toiletries required during their rehabilitation.
For the initial three months of rehabilitation, they are not allowed visitors and thereafter, family members are allowed to visit them twice a month. However, these rehabilitants are allowed to maintain contact with their families by telephone where they are allowed phone calls to their families every Sunday between 9.30 am and 4.00 pm.
When these drug addicts are first brought to this facility, they are directed towards agro therapy where they engage in agricultural activities which is believed to be helpful in breaking their drug habit. When they engage in agriculture and see the results of their efforts and the plants bearing fruit by the time they leave the facility, these rehabilitants get great mental satisfaction, said Capt. R.M.S.B. Ratnayake.
During their initial six months at Kandakadu, these rehabilitants also undergo a 10-day Vipassana meditation programme, where they are not allowed to speak to anyone but engage in reflecting on their lives and meditation. This programme is held from 4.30 am to 9.00 pm during the 10 days and is conducted by a Buddhist monk from the Kalaththewa Dhamma Bhawana Centre. This is aimed at curing their minds.
The Kandakadu facility has made provisions for all four religious denominations to practice their own faiths. Most of these addicts are those who have lost their families or their parents are either separated or overseas. This facility does not allow mobile phones or food from outside as a precautionary measure. According to the councillors, the success rate of this programme is around 50 percent, which is far higher than many of such facilities. However, they said that there is a certain percentage that relapses.

Determined to recover...
Richie Van Royen
In 1983, I got into bad company and started smoking and taking other drugs. I am a chef and have worked in Abu Dhabi. When I returned to Sri Lanka, I got into the drug business with some friends. In fact, the police warned me on many occasions and eventually I was arrested. There was no bail and they sent me here for one year. This is my first time in rehab. I have been undergoing this programme for five months and 14 days. It is very effective and it’s the best place for these young boys who have got into this bad habit. My father was a Naval officer. Now I am 58 years old and I have realised that I must turn my life around. My brothers are living in Abu Dhabi and my mother is here because of me. I want to change and go back and live a good life. I had many girlfriends, but never settled down. I was introduced to heroin by some American sailors who came to Sri Lanka. I was working at Holiday Inn at the time. I want to get over this habit and I feel I am finally ready and have the strength to stay clean.

I am 28 and from Beruwala. I have my parents and two brothers. I got used to drugs at the age of 18 through a neighbour and have been doing drugs ever since. I initially came to this facility in 2016, but relapsed after around two months due to bad company. I was brought back by the Kandakadu follow-up officers. I am scared that when I go back, this time too my friends might draw me back into drugs. Therefore, my family is trying to send me overseas for employment, once I am released. I had a girlfriend but because of my drug addiction, she left me. I want to go back and try to stay clean and start my life with her.
Lakshman Kumara
I am 53, married, and a father of two sons and a daughter. I started doing drugs in 1983. I was given drugs by a prostitute who told me it would help my endurance. But eventually, it took away everything including my strength. I come from a good family and have been to many rehabilitation centres, but have not managed to kick this habit. In every other facility I went to, I managed to get my hands on drugs. But this place is different and I have been totally clean for the past three months. I want to change as even my children are also suffering because of me. This facility is very effective and I am certain that once I get through these 12 months of abstinence and go through this programme, I will be able to stop this habit and live peacefully with my wife and children.
