Avant Garde: MR in premature delight
Govt. turns political typhoon into storm

Writing on this day of National Mourning at the passing away of the Venerable Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera, this is a further lament for this sad loss to our people and country. We have lost one who enhanced the abiding respect for his robe through years of service to the Buddha Sasana, and extended it towards an unmatched commitment to political change to preserve democracy and a civilized society. The lament at this great loss must lead us to the path that will help our society realize the goals that he fought so hard for, especially in his final years. These came through giving leadership to the National Movement for a Just Society, which championed the cause for a Common Candidate to challenge President Mahinda Rajapaksa, and helped bring to an end the many dangers that such an extended term would have brought to the country.
He gave leadership to a political campaign that political leaders were unable or unwilling to accept. He gave guidance to a campaign that sought a commonality of purpose far beyond the capability of the opposition political leaders of the day; and, had the daring to challenge a leadership that had already shown contempt for serious opposition and vengeance to those who dared stand against the power that prevailed.
Regrettably, or through the impact of fate on our society, if such is possible, at the time the Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera was closing his eyes to this world, far away in Singapore, we were caught in the midst of an emerging political typhoon, arising from a key issue he was deeply concerned about in his campaign for good governance. It was the Avant Garde affair.
What would have been a political typhoon of major destructive impact on the Government, has now been changed to a political storm by the even belated action of the Government to revoke all pacts with Avant Garde and go ahead with prosecutions against individuals and institutions involved. This would seem an unplanned but a deserving tribute to the late Ven. Sobitha Thera, knowing his commitment to the fight against corruption.
Avant Garde remains
The departure of Tilak Marapana from the Cabinet, over the Avant Garde issue, good as it was, did not defuse the issue. Even though belated, his realization of the error in defending his legal client in Parliamentary debate is welcome. Yet, there were many unresolved issues in this matter that cannot be concluded with a single resignation. It appears that both President Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe understood the major rumblings of Avant Garde that will continue in consensual governance, involving the two major parties in the country.
Underscoring the very nature of the issue is the public boast by Mahinda Rajapaksa to the media that "Law and Order Minister Tilak Marapana, being an honest politician, had told the truth about Avant Garde in Parliament....If the Minister of Law and Order, the Justice Minister and the Attorney General are speaking the truth, what others are speaking about Avant Garde is nonsense," the former President said.
The Government's action to revoke the pacts with Avant Garde and proceed with prosecutions gives the lie to this boast by the leader of the Government that promoted the Avant Garde corruption and criminality. The fact is the truth about Avant Garde has yet to come out. There is an inquiry about a floating armoury recently intercepted by the Sri Lanka Navy, found to have weapons not initially declared, more weapons than were subsequently admitted, weapons that had their serial numbers erased, and a huge amount of ammunition, too. There is much more than a boatload of questions about this arms shipment alone that will require the closest examination, before any receipt of honesty and clearance is issued to Avant Garde, and those who were responsible for promoting its activities, during the past regime and even today. It is important to note that this floating armoury was not included in the observations made to Court by the Attorney General, and referred to by Mr. Marapana in Parliament.
Importantly, we are now reminded that the Attorney General's original investigation report on Avant Garde presented to the National Executive Council earlier this year, recommended criminal action be instituted against the institution and Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, which recommendations were not implemented.
It is, therefore, far too early for Mahinda Rajapaksa or Tilak Marapana to give a clean sheet to Avant Garde, and far ahead of any proper legal possibilities to arrest any person, however important, on this most sensitive matter of the issue and control of arms.
The matter of permitting or allowing the arrest of persons on this issue needs emphasis, because of the statement by a Cabinet Minister himself, that former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, responsible for forming Avant Garde, would not, or should not, be arrested because he played a major role in the defeat of the LTTE. The role that anyone played in the defeat of the LTTE, especially in leadership positions, will always earn due respect. But such respect and regard surely cannot be extended to matters that had nothing to do with the battle to defeat the LTTE, and is very much involved with the depths of corruption to which the country was dragged.
Such thinking, even coming from the Ministry of Justice, could also be used to prevent any action against former President Mahinda Rajapaksa too, on matters of established corruption or alleged criminality, because he gave political leadership to the defeat of the LTTE. It must be recalled that both the President and Prime Minister have acknowledged this leadership role of Mahinda Rajapaksa, but remain bound by the mandate of the people to cleanse this land of the forces of corruption. Those who make such calls to prevent the arrest of key personalities, involved in criminal or fraudulent activity, are obviously not aware of the mandate given by the people for good governance on January 8, under the clear guidance of the late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera.
This is worth remembering by all who benefited from the late Ven. Sobitha Thera's guidance and leadership, and hold important positions today, at the time when the nation mourns his demise and extends to him our sincere wishes for the eternal bliss of Nirvana.
Challenges to unity
The coming weeks will be of the utmost importance to the Government, in ensuring its unity based on consensual understanding within a Grand Coalition. The challenges to unity will be varied with the new "Joint Opposition" in Parliament led by Mr. Dinesh Gunawardena; the emergence of trade union opinion against the move to take the EPF away from the Central Bank and merge it with the ETF, under a different administration; increased activity on the call for the release of all Tamils held under detention without indictment, trial or conviction; and, the continuing voices against the issues of Geneva 2015.
The manner in which Mahinda Rajapaksa used the resignation of Tilak Marapana and what he said in Parliament on Avant Garde in an attempt to show that all charges of corruption against the Rajapaksa regime are not valid or false, is just one aspect of the range of challenges the Government will have to face in the coming weeks.
The emerging divisions within the TNA - gaining increasing importance, can be a major burden in carrying out the tasks of peace building and reconciliation. This will require swifter action, especially by President Sirisena, on pledges made in the Yahapalanaya Manifesto and his address to the nation at the last Independence Day, on peace building based on development, reconciliation and understanding. The challenges to this will come from the pro-racist grouping in the new "Joint Opposition" that will seek to gain strength from any direct political activity in the North, and the release of Tamil detainees, whether in smaller or larger batches.
Moving ahead
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe showed the strategic path ahead for the national economy when he informed Parliament of his Economic Policy Statement last week. Giving flesh to some of the immediate aspects of this Economic Plan will be the first Budget of this consensual government to be presented next week by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
The best economic policies will be worthless amidst delays and obstacles in efforts to rid this land of fraud and corruption, as in Avant Garde. The people, who gave their mandate for Good Governance on January 8, are keen to see faster and genuine progress against corruption.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe must be strengthened in the fight against corruption, for the country to reap the fruits of this economic policy, whether this requires more resignations, and speedier arrests that lead to good convictions in court, of whoever deserves it.
Tilak Marapana walked the plank by trying to pass the buck to police creativity and fiction. Remaining firm on a policy of truth will bring the best results.
