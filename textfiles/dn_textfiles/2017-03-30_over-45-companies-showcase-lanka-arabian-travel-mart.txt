Over 45 companies to showcase Lanka at Arabian Travel Mart

Over 45 Sri Lankan companies are billed to participate in the annual Arabian Travel Mart (ATM) from April 24 to 26 in World Trade Centre Dubai.
In its 22nd edition, Arabian Travel Market 2015 witnessed a year-on-year visitor attendance increase of 15% to over 26,000, with exhibiting companies increasing by 5% to 2,873. Business deals worth more than US$2.5 billion were signed over the four days.
The 2016 ATM posted a 7% year-on-year rise in visitor numbers with more than 28,000 trade visitors attending the show, which took place from 25-28 April at Dubai World Trade Centre. The 2016 edition boasted an additional hall, with 423 main stand holders representing 86 countries, 64 country pavilions and over 100 new exhibitors making their debut.
Leading with a topical mid-market theme, the initial results for the 23rd travel and tourism industry showcase, released by organiser Reed Travel Exhibitions, also recorded a 9% increase in the number of Buyers’ Club members, with a similar percentage hike in the number of other quality visitors such as VIPs, sponsors and speakers, compared to 2015.
“The initial estimated figures for this year's show highlights ATM's significance as a leading exhibition for the region's travel and tourism sector, as an increasing number of destinations ramp-up efforts to drive travel and tourism as part of economic diversification and sustainability,” Arabian Travel Market Exhibition Manager,Nadege Noblet-Segers said .
“The overall increase in visitor numbers and specifically the 9% rise in key buyers (those with budget responsibility for regional and international contracting) underscores ATM's importance to trade buyers and also means ATM 2016 is poised to top last year's record US$2.5 billion in business deals facilitated.
“This year's popular mid-market theme also resonated with the region's travel professionals - with many exhibitors leveraging opportunities to launch mid-tier brands as well as discussing strategies, developments and future trends during the ATM seminars,” added Noblet-Segers.
