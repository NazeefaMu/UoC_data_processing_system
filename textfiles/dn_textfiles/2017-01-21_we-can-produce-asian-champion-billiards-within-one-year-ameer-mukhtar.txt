We Can produce an Asian champion in billiards within one year - Ameer Mukhtar

Sri Lanka produced the first World Champion in 1973 when M.J.M.Lafir won the World Billiards title, 23 years before we won the World Cricket crown in 1996. Even though we were at world’s best level in billiards long before, the sport has been neglected along with its champions for so long. The annual billiards nationals is the only event that has been recognised by the sporting fraternity and conducted by the national governing body, Billiards and Snooker Association of Sri Lanka (BSASL) under great difficulty with a lesser media exposure.
Ameer Mukhtar is a well known personalty in not just Sri Lankan, but in the world billiard scene who has vast experience as a national level cueist, coach and a referee. He is the one and only Sri Lankan to obtain Gold certificate in international refereeing .
Mukhtar took to sports during his school days at St. Benedict’s and Zahira College, Colombo. He was into athletics, soccer, rugby, wrestling and judo. He stepped into billiards accidentally. Mukhtar was selected to the Sri Lankan team which participated at the 1962 Asia Youth Soccer Championship in Thailand.
He had a knee injury during the match against Iran which forced him to exit from soccer.
“Then I stepped into billiards in 1970 and mastered the cue sport as a player. I represented national team from 1991 and quit my playing career in 2016.
I played for YMCA and later obtained the membership of Moors SC and Automobile Association. My first big break as a billiards referee was in 1991 where I served as a referee and a team manager at the 7th Bell Masters Snooker Championship in India. The Asian Billiards and Snooker Association accepted me as a referee in 1988. I obtained the Asian Silver and Gold Certificates in 2009 and 2011 respectively.
The most precious achievement of my career is obtaining the International Gold Certificate in 2014. It facilitate me to officiate top level tournaments all over the world,” he explained.
Mukhtar has contributed a lot for Sri Lankan billiards and works as the chief referee since 2000. He has officiated 15 Asian tournaments and 8 World Championships including two occasions as chief referee in Asian championships.
Commenting on present state of Sri Lankan billiards Mukhtar said due to some key issues, the sport has not developed into its full potential. Lack of coaches and not having a proper practice venue have left the sport in despair.
“We brought down two international coaches, spending nearly Rs. 1 million to train our cueists. But the BSASL is not in a position to spend such big money continuously. Even though Sports Minister pledged his support in uplifting billiards, things have not materialized as yet. At least if we have a permanent practice venue, we still can uplift the sport,” Mukhtar further said. “ I have the need, capacity and courage to help uplift billiards as I love this sport. If the necessities provided, I can mould an Asian champion within an year.
There are lot of talented players, but must provide with right guidance and techniques,” Mukhtar concluded.
