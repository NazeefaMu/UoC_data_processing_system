Mendis misses double ton on 23rd birthday

CHITTAGONG, Friday – Kusal Mendis fell four runs short of his maiden Test double century on his 23rd birthday but Sri Lanka cut their deficit to a single digit in the first Test against Bangladesh in Chittagong on Friday.
Left-arm spinner Taijul Islam removed Mendis for 196 before Sri Lanka reached 504-3 by close on the third day to trail Bangladesh's first innings total of 513 runs by just 9 runs.
Pace bowler Mustafizur Rahman earlier broke Mendis' 308-run second wicket stand with Dhananjaya de Silva, who fell for 173 runs after resuming his innings on 104.
De Silva and Mendis dominated the opening session of the day after Sri Lanka resumed their innings on 187-1.
Bangladesh had to wait for the second new ball to get their first success as Mustafizur got a leading edge from de Silva for wicketkeeper Liton Das to complete a high catch.
De Silva faced 229 balls and hit 21 fours along with a six in his fourth Test century and the second in as many Tests.
Mendis added another 107-run with Roshen Silva for the third wicket before he gave a catch to Mushfiqur Rahim at midwicket.
He survived a run-out when he had a mix-up with Roshen in the middle of the pitch after crossing his 150-run mark.
Mehedi Hasan made an awkward throw from extra cover after Mendis drove Taijul, allowing him to return to the pitch before wicketkeeper Liton could break the stumps.
Bangladesh were also unlucky in the morning as de Silva survived a strong lbw appeal on 119 off Taijul when the ball hit him on his toe before going to the slips.
With the hosts having already used both their reviews, they had no choice but to accept the decision of the on-field umpire.
Mendis hit left-arm spinner Sunzamul Islam for a boundary to bring his fourth Test hundred off 200 balls.
De Silva reached his 1,000 runs in Tests on 154, joining Roy Dias as the quickest Sri Lankan to achieve the feat in his 23rd innings.
De Silva’s and Mendis’ wickets were the only ones Bangladesh were able to capture on a batting paradise which has proved a heartbreak for bowlers.
By the close Roshen Silva and skipper Dinesh Chandimal had figured in an unfinished stand of 89 to carry Sri Lanka to 504-3 by stumps.
Silva who made an unbeaten half century on his Test debut against India at Delhi followed that innings to remain 87 not out inclusive of five fours and one six. Chandimal was unbeaten on 37.
