A special offer from Ceylinco Healthcare
Promoting early detection of breast cancer

The Ceylinco Healthcare Centre will join institutions around the world this October to promote early detection as a means of minimising the adverse impacts of breast cancer on individuals and communities, to mark the month dedicated universally to breast cancer awareness.
The Centre, a wholly-owned subsidiary of life insurance market leader Ceylinco Life, has announced discounts of 15 per cent and 20 per cent respectively for individuals and groups of five or more who obtain one of two precautionary screening packages throughout October.
The first package for women over 40 years of age comprises consultation, a mammogram and a breast scan, and will be offered at Rs 6,375/- instead of the standard price of Rs 7,500/- the Centre said. A group of five or more who book the package together will pay just Rs 6,000/- per person.
The second package, reduced to Rs 2,750 from Rs 3,250/- is for women below the age of 40 and comprises of a consultation and a breastscan. The group price of this package during October will be Rs 2,600/- per person.
The Centre said it will also offer discounts on additional tests such as Pap smears and CA 125 to those who obtain these discounted screening packages this October, and make other special offers available to visitors to the Centre's Facebook page.
"Although it has been established that detection and treatment in the early stages can result in breast cancer being overcome, many women are reluctant to make periodic screening part of their healthcare regime," states Dr. Charuky Weerasuriya, Senior Medical Officer in a press release issued by Ceylinco Healthcare Centre. "Our efforts every October are to leverage the awareness created globally during the month to encourage more women to undergo screening. After all, if one has a potentially life-saving opportunity at the cost of a meal at a quality restaurant, why not take it?"
The Ceylinco Healthcare Centre is equipped with state-of-the-art facilities for the detection and treatment of cancer. Visitors undergo screening or treatment in a comfortable non-hospital atmosphere.
The Centre also offers moral support to cancer patients through a cancer support group, a team of professionally trained caregivers who assist cancer patients on a one-to-one basis.
The team at the Centre's Breast Care Unit comprises of doctors, radiologists, a pathologist, breast surgeons, oncologists, nurses, radiographers and customer service staff. Located at Park Street, Colombo 02, the Centre offers services ranging from history-based risk assessment to clinical examination, mammography, ultrasound investigation as well as multi-modal treatment options.
