Salman Khan KING of Rs 100 crore films

After Bajrangi Bhaijaan, Salman Khan is reigning at the box office yet again. His Diwali release with Sonam Kapoor – Prem Ratan Dhan Payo, broke the Rs.100 crore barrier in three days flat. While this is a record in itself that an actor’s film earns more than Rs. 100 crore consecutively in a year, but achieving this task in three days is simply mind-blowing!
The actor has been in the industry for 26 years now and as he turns 50 this year, he has achieved a feat like no one else.
The Bigg Boss 9 host has nine Rs. 100 crore movies to his credit and that’s why he is the KING of Rs 100 crore films.
Yes, Salman Khan has delivered nine 100 crore films in 5 years and his closest rival is his dear friend, Shah Rukh Khan who is on five 100 crore films followed by Ajay Devgn and Aamir Khan with four 100 crore films.
