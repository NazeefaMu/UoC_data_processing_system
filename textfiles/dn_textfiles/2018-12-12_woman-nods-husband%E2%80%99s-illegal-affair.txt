Woman nods husband’s illegal affair

A wife has invited an illegal wife of her husband to reside at her house, officials of the Talawa Children and Woman Affairs Unit said.
A 38-year-old married man of three children, a resident of Kuruduwewa, Talawa, has been living with a woman at a house unknown to her legal wife.
The illegal wife delivered a child and the legal wife came to know the true situation of her husband and has come to the house seeking explanation.
She somehow compelled the husband to return and thereafter, they have been rowing and the husband has been harassing her regularly, she has told the police.
Police were told that she has asked the husband to come to her place along with his illegal wife or build a separate house near the first house but not to go away neglecting her and their three children.
