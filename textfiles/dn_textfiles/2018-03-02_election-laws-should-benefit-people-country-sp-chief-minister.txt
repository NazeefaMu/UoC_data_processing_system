Election laws should benefit  people, country - SP Chief Minister

A new election mechanism when introduced, it should be formulated and implemented under a simple and practically productive method avoiding unwarranted complexities and distortions in people’s representations, following the results of respective elections, Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal De Silva said.
“Therefore, when making changes to the existing law, they should be framed with utmost care and after extensive research and study in such a way which is benifical to both the people and the country,”the Southen Province Chief Minister further added.
He made the above observations commenting on the post Local Government Elections developments in the country when questioned by the media.
“Provisions for right women’s representation in the supreme Legislature and other governing authorities is quite a factual obligation and right as a policy,” he said.
“However, the recent laws introduced with regard to women’s representation in Local Government Bodies have generated practical problems and unseen complexities,” he said.
“The people could not accept the new election law because the provisions for the increase in women’s representation up to 25 per cent have created unexpected technical hitches in the implementations of the new election law.
