Strengthening Sri Lankan and French ties

Prof. Mohan Munasinghe was bestowed with the honorary distinction of Officier de la Légion d’Honneur (Officer of the Legion of Honour) by French Ambassador in Sri Lanka Jean-Marin Schuh recently.
The ‘Légion d’Honneur’ is the first and highest national order and distinction of the French Republic, coming directly under the purview of the President of France.
Prof Mohan Munasinghe is a leading world authority on sustainable development, economics, energy and environment. He has graduated from top-world universities, and taught as Visiting Professor at leading universities worldwide. He has served, on many occasions, as expert advisor/consultant to world bodies, including many UN agencies, the World Bank or the ECC to name a few, or as Honorary senior advisor to the Government of Sri Lanka.
He funded the Munasinghe Institute for Development (MIND), which continues to actively contribute to inspiring and empowering young generations to continue working on sustainable development.
Prof. Munasinghe has previously been awarded with many international prizes and medals for public service, research and applications, including the prestigious 2007 the prestigious Nobel Peace Prize, which he shared as Vice Chair of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), “for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change”.
His research and applications have contributed to the success of COP21 Paris Agreement on climate change, in December 2015. He has in particular been of great help to France in helping mobilizing public opinion in Sri Lanka and throughout the world, in the framework of Paris agreement preparation.
