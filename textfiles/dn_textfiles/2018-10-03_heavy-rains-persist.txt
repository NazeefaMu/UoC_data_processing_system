Heavy rains to persist

Rainfall of about 150mm could be expected in some regions of the North-Central, Central and Uva provinces, while rainfall of about 100mm could be expected in other parts of the island, the Meteorology Department said.
The Meteorology Department said that inter-monsoon conditions had developed around the country. Due to atmospheric disturbances, showers are expected to continue during the next few days.
Showers or thundershowers could occur in most parts of the island after 2.00 p.m, while coastal areas may experience them during mornings as well. The Meteorology Department told the public to take precautions against lightning.
Heavy rain could be experienced from Matara to Pottuvil via Hambanthota and from Puttalam to Negombo. Wind speeds could vary between 15 and 20 kmph.
