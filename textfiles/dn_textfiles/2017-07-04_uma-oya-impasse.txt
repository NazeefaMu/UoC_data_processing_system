The Uma Oya impasse

Development, they say, is a necessary evil. Most development projects involve some kind of environmental trade off. This should be ‘worth it’ for the project to succeed. On the other hand, there are some projects where the environmental damage far exceeds the benefits arising from the development project. These projects have no long term value and may in fact pose a danger to the lives of people in the long run.
The much-hyped Uma Oya project launched by the previous Government falls to the latter category. The avowed purpose of this project is the diversion of water to the Hambantota area, which does have a water shortage. It also happens to be the fiefdom of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who had a habit of initiating massive projects squarely aimed at his hometown apparently to boost his ego and popularity. Among the white elephant projects which he started in the area are: the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport, the Hambantota Port, the Hambantota Convention Centre and the Sooriyawewa cricket stadium, which is seeing some action during the current Zimbabwe tour.
Since these facilities are of little use, they cost the taxpayer heavily in two ways. Massive loans have been obtained to construct them and they have to be serviced from this year. This is funded by the public. Moreover the day-to-day operation of these projects is entirely funded by the public purse. Uma Oya too was such a grandiose project conceived by the Rajapaksa Government. And like most of the projects it initiated Uma Oya too had a corruption element. With a projected estimate of US$ 560 million, some experts say it has cost four times the actual estimate.
But the biggest casualty of the Uma Oya is not even the public purse which does get a bashing. It is the pristine environment of the Bandarawela area that has been affected the most by the construction of a 20 Km long tunnel and associated works. The tunnelling itself has caused immense damage to the mountainous landscape but as if that was not enough, it has adversely affected the water table and literally shaken the very foundations of buildings and houses in the area. Bandarawela residents have already held a massive demonstration against the project which virtually shut down the entire town.
Hambantota is no doubt an area which suffers from prolonged droughts. It does need a water supply project for irrigation and drinking purposes, but this was perhaps not the best way to go about it. Uma Oya supplied water to the North Central Province in the natural course of events, but that did not matter to the Rajapaksas who lacked the vision to see beyond the confines of Hambantota. There is evidence that they had disregarded the environmental reports and worse, not done any advanced environmental impact assessments on the project in the hurry to add yet another ‘groundbreaking’ project to their list of accomplishments.
The present Government is now on the horns of a dilemma since the project is almost completed. There are only two options available – suspension or continuation. President Maithripala Sirisena has not hidden the fact that he has always opposed this project and this seems to be the overall sentiment of the Government as well. The attempts being made by certain Opposition figures to pin the blame for Uma Oya on this Government are nothing short of laughable when it is common knowledge that it was started during the previous regime. However, no one dared to protest against the project then due to the white van phenomenon. Now that this Government has created the democratic space for protests, there are daily protests against virtually everything from SAITM to Uma Oya.
Cancelling a project of this magnitude is never easy and the Government has rightly sought expert opinion without necessarily pandering to emotions and populism. A team of Norwegian experts who have knowledge in this topic will examine the project and give their verdict with inputs from the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau and the National Building Research Organisation. The Government is likely to thoroughly assess the benefits: environmental impact ratio in deciding whether to go ahead with the project. The Government has to ensure justice to all the parties concerned in this regard.
The concept of ‘development for the sake of development’ is mostly dangerous because one tends to sweep the other relevant factors away. Any development project that leads to severe environmental damage is not worth in the long run. This is especially so regarding our picturesque but fragile hill stations which are already feeling the ill effects of climate change. A fault line or a crack in a wall is dangerous anywhere, but it is doubly so in a mountainous locality. And water, another casualty of the Uma Oya project, is a precious resource that we cannot afford to lose.
Uma Oya is a good lesson for lawmakers and development planners on the pitfalls that should be avoided when implementing mega development schemes. No major development project should be implemented without a wide public discourse hereafter.
