The ‘ABC Learnies Biscuit’ is the first of its kind in Sri Lanka. We wanted to make learning more engaging and what better way to have biscuits spell out your favorite words.
These biscuits will make mothers and teachers lives so much easy in terms of feeding and also teaching at the same time. It is important to harness a picturesque memory at a very young age and we believe our attempt to create engagement and long term memory will benefit kids around Sri Lanka for psychological growth.”
