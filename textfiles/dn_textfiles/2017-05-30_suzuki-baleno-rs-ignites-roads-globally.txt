The Suzuki Baleno RS ignites roads globally

The front-runner of the automobile sector in India, Maruti Suzuki India Limited (MSIL), recently launched the invincible sporty counterpart of their latest crossover utility vehicle, Suzuki Baleno.
Suzuki Baleno's latest variant, the Baleno RS (Road Sport) has been able to accelerate its way into the high performance league with the 1.0L Boosterjet direct Injection turbocharged engine offering 20% more power and 30% more torque compared to a naturally aspirated1.2L petrol engine, which makes Suzuki Baleno RS an exceptional drive in tropical conditions both in urban and suburban terrains. The Baleno RS offers a smooth and peppy ride across all driving conditions, thanks to peak torque available within a wide range of RPM (150Nm @ 1700-4500 RPM). This means, the driver can drive effortlessly without frequent change of gears. Boosterjet is a powerful combination of two technologies: direct fuel injection and a turbocharger. The Baleno RS effectively responds to the driver's command for acceleration and performance, thanks to the powerful all-aluminum, three-cylinder, 1.0L Boosterjet engine.
