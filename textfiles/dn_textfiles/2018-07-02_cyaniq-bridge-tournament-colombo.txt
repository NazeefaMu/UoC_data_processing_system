Cyaniq Bridge Tournament in Colombo

Cyaniq Global is partnering Vajira Bridge Center in hosting the inaugural Cyaniq Bridge Championship at Galle Face Hotel on July 8. The event partnership aligns with the company’s commitment towards the development of intellectual capital and business level synergies between top-tier corporate entities and executives.
Vajira Bridge Centre is a friendly Bridge Club with a patronage of over 100 members who meet for Duplicate Bridge thrice a week at the Founder’s residence on Vajira Road, Colombo 05. At present, Vajira Bridge Center boasts a veritable list of VIP players, including: Ronnie Peiris, Shireen Canekeratne, Koluu Ranawake, Malini Wijeratne, Justice Shiranee Tilakawardane, MP Wasantha Senanayake and Dilanjan De Zoysa to name a few. The club which was founded by former national Bridge player Rex Perera is in its sixth year of play and regularly participates in national and international level competitions throughout the year.
Founder of Vajira Bridge Center, Rex Perera, stated, “I am honored that the Vajira Bridge Centre, which started out of sheer passion and enthusiasm, has led entities like Cyaniq and Galle Face Hotel to notice the value it offers, and to help create much-needed awareness for a valuable game like bridge, which is widely played on a global level.”
Contract bridge, or simply bridge, is a trick-taking card game using a standard 52-card deck. It is played by four players in two competing partnerships, with partners sitting opposite each other around a table. Millions of people play bridge worldwide in clubs, tournaments, online and with friends at home, making it one of the world’s most popular card games, particularly among seniors. Warren Buffet, Bill Gates and Martina Navratilova are a few prominent international figures that are fans of the game, while Dwight D. Eisenhower, Mahatma Gandhi, Margaret Thatcher, and Winston Churchill were avid players of yesteryear too. Besides offering cognitive stimulation, playing bridge significantly lowers the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia as per a study conducted by the College of Medicine of Yeshiva University.
The World Bridge Federation (WBF) is the governing body for international competitive bridge, with numerous other bodies governing bridge at the regional level. The inaugural Bridge Championship at Galle Face Hotel, which is a whole-day tournament, will feature top-level 48 national players, some of who have represented Sri Lanka in international championships, such as Commonwealth Nations Bridge Championships and Asia Cup Bridge Championships.
Chief Executive of Cyaniq, Rohitha Perera, said, “As a company that has vested interest in all things that are intellectually stimulating and analytical, Cyaniq is proud to be part of this exciting inaugural Cyaniq bridge tournament, which serves to create awareness of the game of bridge, add intellectual value to society, and garner interest in the game from the next generation.”
In its inaugural chapter, the Cyaniq Bridge Tournament will be contested for the Rex Perera Challenge Trophy and the participation of 48 players are expected at the event. The corporate patronage of Cyaniq Global has been rallied for the event and will be instrumental in the successful execution of the event’s proceedings.
Associate Director of Public Relations of the Galle Face Hotel, Shalini Perera, stated, “It is an absolute pleasure that an opportunity like this has arisen where Galle Face Hotel can contribute in terms of intellectual association. Loved for its history and superlative levels of hospitality, I along with the management of Galle Face Hotel are thrilled to be hosting an event that is the first of its kind in Sri Lanka.”
The winning pair who will get to carry home the Rex Perera Challenge Trophy will also receive gifts from Parker, Mlesna and Galle Face Hotel. The event is intended to be worked out annually for the Rex Perera Challenge Trophy and hopes to develop the standard of play within the country while also contributing to the participation levels of the game.
