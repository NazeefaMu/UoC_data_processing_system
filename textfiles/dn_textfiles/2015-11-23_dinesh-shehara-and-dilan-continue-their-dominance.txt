Dinesh, Shehara and Dilan continue their dominance

Mobil Brand Ambassadors Dinesh Jayawardana, Shehara Jayawardana and Dilan Seneviratne finished off the season in style with all of them securing podiums.
It was a cloudy and extremely wet Sunday, as thunderstorms hit the CEAT SLARDAR – AMRC Championship hard. Nevertheless, the event went on as planned, and we witnessed some spectacular driving and riding by the competitors.
Shehara Jayawardana started off the proceedings for the day by starting 3rd on the grid in SL-H up to 1600cc and comfortably held onto the position all the way to the end, with the help of a brilliant start, she challenged the leaders into the first corner. Shehara, drove a well controlled race in wet weather to secure yet another podium, in the SL-H up to 1600 class.
As the much awaited Super Car event was about to get underway, the first thunderstorm hit Pannala for the day.
Dinesh Jayawardana, who qualified in the front row next to pole sitter Ashan Silva had an unfortunate mechanical failure and was unable to get off the line.
From the time the race began, every single moment was filled with excitement, as cars were sliding and spinning all over the track, as conditions were almost impossible to drive in.
With all the action unfolding ahead, Dilan Seneviratne, who suffered in qualifying and started the race from the back of the grid, was slowly but surely making his way up the order. In the end, Seneviratne who stayed away from all the drama that unfolded,drove brilliantly using his years of experience, to take the flag and win the race ahead of Pasindu Peiris and Ushan Perera, who finished second and third respectively.
Finally, Dinesh Jayawardana closed the proceedings for the day in style as he came from the back of the grid in Race 2 to finish third with a brilliant drive to give the Mobil Powered cars a 100% podium ratio.
