PIA boss detained over SriLankan lease deal

Pakistan International Airlines’ interim CEO Bernd Hildenbrand has been placed on an Exit Control List (ECL), according to Pakistan’s The News sources. Deputy Director of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), Khawaja Hammadur Rehman, issued the notification on March 15.
The FIA is investigating Hildenbrand and other PIA executives over alleged kickbacks, embezzlement and mismanagement in the lease of an A330-300 aircraft from SriLankan Airlines.
The wet-leased A330 was returned, after a six-month contract. PIA reportedly paid US$ 19 million for the six month deal. A Senate panel recently released an enquiry into PIA’s finances and management, finding that corruption was a problem in all areas of business. “Corruption is rampant in purchase of spares parts, allocating of space for freight, purchase of tickets, in enrolments and postings and in catering and engineering departments.” (www.ch-aviation.com)
