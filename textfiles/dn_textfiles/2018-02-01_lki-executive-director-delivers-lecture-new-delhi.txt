LKI Executive Director delivers lecture in New Delhi

Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute Executive Director Dr. Dinusha Panditaratne delivered a special lecture titled "Role of Sri Lanka in South Asia and Beyond: Emerging New Contours” at the Habitat Centre, New Delhi, recently.
The lecture was organized by the Research and Information System for Developing Countries (RIS) in New Delhi.
Dr. Panditharatne reflected on four emerging contours and Sri Lanka’s role in South Asia and beyond. She identified these contours as Sri Lanka in the centre of the Indian Ocean gaining a South Asian geographic identity; Sri Lanka in the past focusing on political diplomacy, but now more towards economic diplomacy; Sri Lanka strategically non-aligned, but cautious and actively engaging with regional powers; and Sri Lanka seeking to demonstrate that it follows regional and international norms.
The presentation encapsulated the discernible shifts in these characteristics. She noted that these four developments in Sri Lanka’s foreign relations are nascent, but generally positive. Pursued in combination, these developments will elevate Sri Lanka’s standing, while strengthening its neighbourhood relations, Dr. Panditaratne added.
Dr. Panditaratne also noted in her lecture that Sri Lanka is being rebranded in the present context in its aspiration to be a major trading hub in Asia. Sri Lanka has been able to bring its Free Trade Agreements (FTA) into force, which in turn impact positively on the rebranding process. She stated that economic diplomacy is given priority and adherence to the rule of law and good governance gave a new face to the rebranding process.
