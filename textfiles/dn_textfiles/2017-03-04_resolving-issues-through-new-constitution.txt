Resolving issues through new constitution

Addressing the 34th Session of the UN Human Rights Council, Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera putting his diplomatic resources fully explained that presently the government expects to present the draft legislation on the Truth-Seeking Commission to the Cabinet shortly; within the next two months. Minister Samaraweera knew that he has to do the best and strengthen the position of his friend Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe; only person trusted by the Tamil middle class.
The minister explained in details the government’s resolve to bring justice to the victims of human rights violations remains firm. He said the public consultations carried out by the Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanisms were another important undertaking which was successfully concluded.
He was advised by various gurus on reconciliation to aim at the middle layers as against the extremist pro Tamil liberation lobby. However he was let down by Sumanthiran of Lanka's main Tamil party when he has asked the United Nations to put pressure on the Lankan government, to investigate and prosecute alleged war crimes committed during the country's 26-year war against Tamil Liberationists.
Reports of human rights abuses
The government agreed in 2015 to act on the reports of human rights abuses, but has done nothing since, M. A. Sumanthiran, MP and spokesman for Tamil National Alliance, said dismissing the stand of the government.
Further he said the government “must be encouraged and made to accomplish every one of those undertakings that they agreed to.” Sumanthiran made this statement at a Foreign Correspondents’ Association forum in Colombo. The U.N. accepted the left and democratic stand on this problem.
Human rights activists have accused the military of killing thousands of civilians, mostly Tamils, during the final weeks of the war and have urged justice for the families of those who disappeared.
But Maithripala/ Ranil government is struggling to implement the UN resolutions, which are politically unpopular among Sinhala middle class. President Maithripala Sirisena has backtracked on giving foreign judges a role in any investigation and prosecution. However the Commissions such as LLRC have proved that Lankan judiciary has not completely degenerated; hence just and fair investigations are possible with a pool of judges from all nationalities.
Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera speaking at the UN session in Geneva, said the government would form a “truth-seeking commission” to investigate conduct during the civil war.
“Our resolve to see the transitional justice process through has not diminished,” Samaraweera told the UN. In the mean time the British Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and Minister for Asia and the Pacific Alok Sharma said yesterday that Lanka should be given time to fully implement. He conveyed this while addressing the High-Level segment of the 34th Session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva.
“We must give Sri Lanka time to fully implement the October 2015 resolution and post-conflict measures required to embed stability, reconciliation and justice,” he said. Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera has promptly met with Minister Sharma on the sidelines of the 34th Session of the UNHRC, and he had briefed Minister Sharma on recent developments with regard to the reconciliation process in Sri Lanka.
In Geneva, Lanka watchers have been talking about a recent interview with Chandrika Kumaratunga past president, currently the chairperson of the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR).
National reconciliation
When a journalist asked former President Kumaratunga, where the country stands in terms of establishing national reconciliation she answered, “It is successfully carried out. In the face of opposition and a handful of extremists, activities are continuing with the blessings of the majority.
Reconciliation means a lengthy activity. What is urgent now is to bring in a new constitution, and then comes the establishment of the Office of the Missing Persons. With these in place, there would not be any necessity to have courts to probe war crimes.” This is an unacceptable statement for number of reasons.
The assertion that reconciliation “is successfully carried out” is an exaggeration to tell the least.
There cannot be total reconciliation without elimination discrimination and injustice and these are the roots causes of Lanka’s civil war – which was fought from 1983 to 2009 between Lankan government forces and the Liberation Tamil Tigers. Chandrika Kumaratunga’s claim that “there would not be any necessity to have courts to probe war crimes” is incorrect. Accountability for wartime abuses is a complicated and difficult issue; even the LLRC report indicates that.
However there is a substantial increase in consciousness among people, Sinhala people, about the grievances of the Tamil people. Land and Police powers should be given to the people of the Northern Province, said MP Athuraliye Rathana Thera recently.
Addressing the inaugural conference of the Sri Lanka National Council, he said that some MPs were constantly claiming to make a new Constitution to resolve the National issue -- which they define as Northern people’s land issues and Tamil speaking police in their areas. “We, too, agree on giving land and police powers to the Northern community.”
