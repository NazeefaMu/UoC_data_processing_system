‘SL a centre of excellence  for security printing’

De La Rue celebrates 30 year joint venture with govt in printing banknotes for the world
Last week, we caught up with Martin Sutherland, CEO of De La Rue while he was in Sri Lanka with the company’s Board of Directors to visit the banknote and security printing facility just outside Colombo.
De La Rue is the biggest printer of banknotes and passports in the world and has been in a successful public private partnership with the Sri Lankan government for more than 30 years, bringing in financial investment and employment to the region.
We talked to him about the importance of Sri Lanka to the company and what the future might look like.
Q: What is the reason for your visit to Sri Lanka?
We have a print factory in Biyagama which employs over 300 people and exports more than 75% of the product it manufactures. The Sri Lankan government owns a 40% holding in the successful joint venture and last year I hosted President Sirisena at our site to mark the 30th anniversary of our partnership.
This year, I decided we should host our De La Rue plc Board meeting here to show how important it is to our business worldwide. We have a number of global hubs and Sri Lanka is one of our centres of excellence for security printing.
It is a world class facility that produces more than a billion banknotes every year, both for the local Central Bank and for many other countries around the world. I was very keen that the Board get a first-hand experience of the excellent work the team do here.
Q: Tell us about De La Rue and what you do?
We are a truly global organisation, providing secure products and services to around 140 countries.
Our purpose is to enable every citizen to participate securely in the global economy, and we enable this by providing products and services that underpin the integrity of trade, the movement of people and goods. And whilst our head office is in the UK along with several other sites, we also have security printing operations in Sri Lanka, Kenya and Malta.
Our business covers three core areas – currency, identity solutions like passports, and brand protection.
We are probably most well known as the world’s largest commercial banknote provider, including printing UK Sterling. Although many people assume that we are heading towards a cashless society, the demand for cash actually continues to grow by 3-4% globally.
It is also the most inclusive of all payment mechanisms, especially when you think that one third of the world’s adult population do not have a bank account and 85% of consumer transactions worldwide are carried out using currency.
We are also the world’s largest commercial passport printer, producing books and paper for around forty countries a year and we deliver some of the world’s most secure passports, designed specifically to meet the needs of each government.
But it’s not just passports. As a global leader in broader ID solutions, we can develop a whole range of domestic and international identity solutions for governments. The need for every person in the world to have a legal and secure identity has never been more important as the world’s population increases.
Finally, we provide physical and digital support to enable governments to gather tax and excise revenues due on regulated products like tobacco and alcohol, and support brand owners like Microsoft protect their supply chains from counterfeiting.
The cost of counterfeit is thought to be a staggering US$1.7 trillion a year, which, if it were a country, would equate to the 10th largest economy in the world by GDP.

Q: What do you produce in the factory in Biyagama and how has it changed over the last 30 years?
De La Rue is just over 200 years old, and throughout that time has a proud record of innovation, for example, developing the first fountain pen and ATM. This history of innovation is at the core of what we do and it is this that continues to make us the global leader in secure printing.
Our site in Sri Lanka is one of five centres of excellence for currency printing globally, alongside two centres in the UK, and our plants in Kenya and Malta. The site has achieved the highest level of security and quality accreditations and we are continually investing to ensure standards are maintained and improved.
Here in Biyagama we started out by producing notes just for the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, but have expanded over the years and now export between 70–80% of the work produced here.
Our operation and investment continued throughout the challenging times that Sri Lanka endured over the turn of the century and we were pleased to be able to support the local community during those difficult times.
We regularly invest in new equipment to be able to provide our customers with the latest security features for the banknotes to ensure the integrity of currency or other security documents.
Q: Does every country have its own currency and security printing operation?
Not many do, as it is a highly complex and capital intensive operation to establish and run. An operation like we have in Sri Lanka is able to meet the currency requirements of Sri Lanka itself, but is also able to run at full capacity to print the currencies of other countries. And the better the factory performs, the more the government benefits – in the form of ongoing employment and an enhanced annual financial dividend.
Q: What has the investment been like so far in Sri Lanka and what is the government’s involvement?
We are proud to have been in a joint venture with the Government of Sri Lanka for over 30 years and have built a strong relationship with them. The joint venture has been a great success.
Over the last year we have increased the volume of production in Sri Lanka and spent about Rs.2 billion to enhance current capability, upgrading equipment but also investing in quality inspection systems.
We have also looked at whether or not we can enhance the capability we have around identity solutions here in Sri Lanka. My focus is to drive a commercially viable and profitable enterprise where we are exporting and that is what drives growth and job creation, providing skilled employment opportunities for the community.
Q: Are you looking at expanding your operations in Sri Lanka?
We have consistently invested in ensuring we have the right level of capability to meet the needs of our customers in Sri Lanka and globally, and we will continue to do so. We have already further enhanced the security printing process with new machinery and technology. The Biyagama factory is a centre of excellence for currency, but could be scaled up to print other security documents such as passports as well.
The Sri Lankan Government is looking to upgrade the passport and the system behind it to be able to provide Sri Lankans with the latest e-passports, which offer greater security and acceptance around the world.
We currently run the British passport system including the data management system and would very much welcome an opportunity to provide this service to the Government here in a similar way and as part of the joint venture.
Q: What are the recent successes for De La Rue?
We are constantly providing support to countries the world over, but I am particularly proud of our recent introduction of polymer banknotes in the UK. We have supported the Bank of England as well as banks in Scotland in designing and printing the new £5 and £10 banknotes and we will begin working on the new £20 as well.
De La Rue is a global leader in ID solutions with a strong track record and we deliver some of the world’s most secure passports. For example, we design and print the UK Passport which I am incredibly proud of. We have also recently won significant contracts in countries such as Malta and Australia to help ensure they are at the leading edge of identity protection.
(Sutherland joined De La Rue as Chief Executive Officer in October 2014. Since joining the company his focus has been on developing a strategy based around the three core areas of the business to ensure a strong future for De La Rue.)
