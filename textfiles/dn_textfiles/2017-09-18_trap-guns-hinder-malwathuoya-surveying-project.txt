Trap guns hinder Malwathuoya surveying project

Anuradhapura Senior Surveying Superintendent K.P.G. Karunanayake has informed the Anuradhapura Government Agent and the irrigation authorities that the trap guns fixed in the jungle hinder the progress of the surveying areas for the proposed lower Malwathuoya Reservoir in Thanthirimale in the Anuradhapura District.
About 4,422 hectares will be submerged with the project including resettlement zones.
The proposed lower Malwathuoya reservoir will be the largest water source in the district. It will contain 169,440 acre feet water capacity with a 3.6 km long dam. The project will cost Rs. 12,300 million to the Government. The construction work of the project will be carried out by the CAMC Engineering Company, a Chinese company engaged in the Yan oya reservoir project. The Chinese Government funds the project.
Anuradhapura Assistant Wildlife Director W.S. Weragama has pointed out that resettlement would clear a large stretch of land from the high security reserves.
The Project Director said around 500 families would be evacuated to accommodate land for the project. They will be resettled in 997 acres of land between the Kaluwila and Narawala Junctions and also in Nalanda, Hatamuna, Randeniya, Handapangoda, Suriyathenna, Ratgama and Aluthgama divisions. Once completed, the reservoir would provide water to the Anuradhapura and Vavuniya districts and helps cultivate 35,000 acres.
