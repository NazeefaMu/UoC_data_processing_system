A timely boost for the cue sport

Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera, the patron of Sri Lanka Billiards and Snooker Association (SLBSA) opened two modern billiards tables for the SLBSA at a ceremony held at the Automobile Association of Ceylon on Thursday.
The two state-of-the-art tables and new sports room, which cost approximately two million rupees, are assets to the SLBSA as well as the Automobile Association of Ceylon to uplift the standard of cue sports in the country. Targeting the forthcoming Asian Billiards and Snooker Championship and the World Billiards and Snooker Championship, SLBSA hosted a tournament called the Best of the Best Cueist.
Winner Thiyagaraja Thanji of YMCA Colombo and runner-up SHSM Aslam of Moors Sports Club were honoured at this occasion with trophies and cash prizes by the State Minister of Law and Order and Prison Reforms Priyankara Jayaratne, one of the vice patrons of the SLBSA. The other vice patron of the Association, John Amaratunga, the Minister of Tourism Development, Christian Religious Affairs and Land was also honoured for the services he had rendered to the Sri Lanka Billiards and Snooker Association.
