Japanese State Foreign Minister to visit

Japanese State Foreign Affairs Minister Kazuyuki Nakane will visit Sri Lanka from August 28 to 30 to participate in the ceremony to commission the patrol vessels donated to Sri Lanka under grant of the Japanese government, to be held tomorrow (29), at the Colombo Port.
During his stay, State Minister Nakane will call on Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and hold meetings with other government leaders to further promote bilateral relations between the two countries.
At the commissioning ceremony, two patrol vessels will be handed over to the Sri Lanka Coast Guard, which will be utilised to improve maritime safety and strengthen control of the country’s maritime borders.
The Japanese Embassy expects that this visit would help further consolidate the ‘Comprehensive Partnership’ between Japan and Sri Lanka.
