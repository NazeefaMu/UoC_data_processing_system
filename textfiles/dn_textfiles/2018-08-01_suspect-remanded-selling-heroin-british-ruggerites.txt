Suspect remanded for selling heroin to British ruggerites

A person who sold heroin to the two British ruggerites who died during their visit to Sri Lanka in hospital last May was arrested by the Fort Police yesterday.
Speaking to the Daily News, Police Media Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said the 38-year-old suspect was arrested near his residence in Wadiyawatte, Wellawatte. He was produced before the Fort Magistrate yesterday and remanded until August 10.
The two British rugby players, 25-year-old Thomas Howard and 26-year-old Thomas Baty had died due to excessive use of heroin.
The British Rugby team comprising 22 players had arrived in Sri Lanka on May 10 and having played a friendly match with CR&FC on May 12 in Colombo.
They had participated in a dinner party at the same venue that was organised for them.
The Colombo Fort Magistrates’ Court in Colombo heard that there was evidence to suggest the men had been sold the drug.
