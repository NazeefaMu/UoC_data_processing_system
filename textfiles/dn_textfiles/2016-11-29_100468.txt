Sarath Silva the elegant left-hander

Visiting his Borella residence I found Sarath Silva, one of the most talented batsmen produced by Nalanda College. As a young kid he used to play softball cricket at Campbell Place. He did not have any high ambitions of playing serious cricket at that time. Sarath also states that he played cricket just for fun. Mr Kandaswamy who was the Prefect of Games was a tower of strength at Nalanda. He spotted this slip of a lad, whose talent he recognized. Mr Kandaswamy immediately invited him to attend first eleven practices.
Sarath states that he did not even have a pair of longs at the time. Anyway he fitted into the setup smoothly at the tender age of 14 years and 3 months. Sarath reiterates that he was selected to bat at no 3, and in the Big Match he carried his bat to score 66. His innings was filled with strokes of sheer elegance.
As far as he can recollect he played for 4 years in the Ist eleven team and has scored hundreds in each of those years. Sarath adds that in his last year he scored four hundreds, they were against Dharmapala, Royal, St Anthony’s and St Benedict’s. Also in that year’s Big Match he got twin fifties.
Sarath recollects, immediately after leaving College he joined SSC and in his first season he got 96 not out. In the next season scored over 500 runs and the late F.C. de Saram paid the highest accolade to Sarath saying that he was the most talented left-hander he has seen.
However Sarath adds that F.C. de Saram also mentioned to him, that he was not showing much interest in the game. Briefly he was a wayward genius.
Sarath Silva, the lanky left-hander was billed to open for a Sri Lankan representive eleven in 1961. The tall West Indian pace man Wesley Hall was at his peak, in that team which toured Sri Lanka. He relates that Wesley Hall had such a long run up, nearly reaching the ropes. When he took stance, to face Hall running up to bowl, he lost his concentration and in the fifth ball he was completely bamboozled and was yorked, lock stock and barrel and clean bowled for a duck. When Richie Benaud’s team toured Sri Lanka, Sarath states he was billed to play and at the last moment for some unknown reason, he was not included, which remains a mystery to this day.
When asked about the best batsman, he has ever played against. Sarath was quick to point out that it was none other than C.I. Gunasekera, who according to Sarath was better than Sanath Jayasuriya. His pick as the best bowler he faced was Sonny Yatawara, he was explosive off the wicket, states Sarath.
He picks F.C. de Saram as the best captain, whom he says never lost control of the game he was handling. Sarath is of the opinion that the elite who managed the game then, were pure “poppycock because they had never played the game”.
These were Sarath’s own words. He recalls that Gerry Gooneratne picked his talent well and Chandrasiri Weerasinghe who never hooked the ball in the air was the best bat he saw concludes Sarath.
