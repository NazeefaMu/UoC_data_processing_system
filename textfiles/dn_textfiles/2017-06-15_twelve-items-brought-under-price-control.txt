Twelve items brought under price control

Twelve items including sugar have been brought under price control and action will be taken against those selling these above the controlled price, said Trade and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen.
He was opening the 378th branch of Sathosa at Kokkadichcholai in the farming and underprivileged area of Paddipalai Secretarial Division of the western sector of Batticaloa, recently.
The ceremony was presided by Paddiruppu electorate organizer S. Ganeshamoorthy. He said the price of sugar has been increased by only Rs. 10. Therefore, traders cannot increase the price arbitrarily. A team of 200 inspectors has been deployed to check on this, he said.
Before the end of this year, 500 branches of Sathosa will open island-wide. The western sector of Batticaloa has been privileged to have one government commercial institution, Ganeshamoorthy said.
