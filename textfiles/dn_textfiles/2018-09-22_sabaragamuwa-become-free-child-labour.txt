Sabaragamuwa to become free of child labour

Steps are being taken to make Sabaragamuwa Province free of child labour, Sabaragamuwa Governor Niluka Ekanayaka said.
She was addressing a scholarship awarding ceremony to schoolchildren of low-income families in Ratnapura, recently. The ceremony was jointly organised by the Ratnapura District Secretariat Office and well-wishers.
According to national statistics, there are 43,714 child labourers in the country and of them, 2,179 are from Sabaragamuwa.
The Governor said steps are taken to make the province free of child labour. Accordingly, plans are afoot to reduce the number of school dropouts by providing a 13-year continuous education to all children.
Also, children and parents are made aware of the value of education while encouraging them for continuous school education. The 13-year education will be made compulsory in the future, she added.
Furthermore, Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council will make businessmen, estate cultivators, mine owners and other sectors aware of the legal and constitutional framework against child labour.
