Five thousand acres in Ratnapura for the landless

Land and Parliamentary Reforms Deputy Minister Dunesh Gankanda said that they were negotiating with the Land Reforms Commission to release 5,000 acres of land in the Ratnapura district to landless people living in the villages and plantations in the area.
The Deputy Minister stressed that those living in the plantations still lived in structures over 100 years old which were unsuitable for human habitation; their tin roofs were now worn away. The Ratnapura district Land Reform Commission manages land with 25,000 people living on these lands and the deputy minister said they would take steps to provide them with title deeds, land for those who do not own land, and development work through the Gamudawa programme.
Further, land held by the plantations and the Land Reform Commission would be given to small-scale investors.
