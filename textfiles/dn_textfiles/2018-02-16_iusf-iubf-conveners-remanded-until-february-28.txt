IUSF, IUBF Conveners remanded until February 28

The Colombo Fort Magistrate ordered to remand Inter- University Students’ Federation (IUSF) Convener Lahiru Weerasekara and Inter-University Bhikkhu’s Federation (IUBF) Convener Ven. Tanpitiye Sugathananda Thera till February 28, yesterday.
It was due to allegedly violating a court order and engaging in a protest held in Colombo on January 25 demanding the government to abolish SAITM.
When the two suspects appeared in court over another case filed against them, Kollupitiya Police complained that several protestors, including the suspects, had attempted to proceed towards Temple Trees, disregarding the court order that urged them not to proceed with the procession, causing disturbance to public peace and obstructing regular traffic flow.
Taking into consideration the facts that they violated a court order, Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne ordered to remand the two suspects till February 28.
