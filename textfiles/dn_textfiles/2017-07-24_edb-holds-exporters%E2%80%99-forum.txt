EDB holds exporters’ forum

The Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade in collaboration with the Export Development Board (EDB) organized the 11th Exporters Forum at the EDB Auditorium on July 18.
The session provided a platform for exporters representing a cross-section of industries to interact with relevant government institutions and seek responses to their trade issues.
State Minister of International Trade Sujeewa Senasinghe said that the Exporters Forum is a good sign of the Government’s continuous efforts to help committed Sri Lankan exporters to go forward. Representatives from government institutions and the private sector were present at the forum and 30 issues were taken up by the State Minister. The next exporters forum will be held in two months.
