Poachers hunt animals by poisoning water

An illegal trade of hunting animals for their meat by poisoning the water in the watering hole near the dried up tanks in the Panwewa, Gannoruwa forest reserves in Hambantota, has been detected by the Hambantota Wild Life Officers.
The officers said the meat is secretly sold to devotees coming to Kataragama.
They also said that a few errant traders were arrested earlier,but,they continue with their illegal trade on the sly.
“Some people engage in these illgal activities by entering the forest in the guise of engaging in Chena cultivation,” Hambantota Wild Life Officer J.A.P.Wijaya Kumara said.
“These poachers lie in wait until animals such as deer, wild boar, monkeys, rabbit etc drink the poisoned water and then take away the carcasses for their meat.” He added that the villagers have found the carcasses of animals that were left behind by the poachers.
