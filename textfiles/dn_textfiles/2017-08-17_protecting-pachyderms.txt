Protecting the pachyderms

The Life of Last Proboscideans: Elephants launched:
On Sunday evening, The Life of Last Proboscideans: Elephants, was officially launched at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute. Written by Tharindu Muthukumarana, the book tells the story of elephants—of their past, their role in the world and what better modes of conservation would be.
“The first treatise on elephantology (the study of elephants) was produced over 2,000 years ago,” Muthukumara said, “and I see my book as the result of an evolution of the field.”
Speaking at the launch were the book’s author, environmentalist Rohan Wijesinha, former Wildlife Department Director General Dr. Sumith Pilapitiya, Managing Trustee of Biodiversity and Elephant Conservation Trust Jayantha Jayawardene and Wildlife and Sustainable Development Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera, as well as the event’s chief guest. Each of the speakers stressed the problems facing the status quo for elephants, discussed the importance of elephants culturally and religiously, and commended Muthukumarana for his efforts to protect the vulnerable creatures.
Pilapitiya, the former Wildlife Department Director General, addressed some issues facing elephants in Sri Lanka specifically. He spoke of an administrative boundary set up in Yala which is harming the elephants’ livelihood because it paid no heed to their natural roaming patterns.
“We must move the fence from an administrative boundary to an ecological boundary to solve the problem,” he said.
Pilapitiya also touched on the elephant infant mortality rate in Yala. “52 percent of baby elephants below two years of age in Yala are dying,” he said, “This is happening because mothers don’t have proper nutrition.” He concluded his speech by saying that Sri Lankans must be proactive in ensuring the security of elephants within the country.
Jayawardene, who acted as a mentor of sorts to the book’s author, spoke next. He touched on the fact that Sri Lankans specifically should be concerned with the welfare and continuance of elephants, given the prominence they hold both religiously and historically to both Buddhism and Hinduism.
Then the author spoke, beginning by wishing everyone a belated “happy and optimistic World Elephant Day,” which was notably just one day before the event, on Saturday, August 12th.
He discussed embarking on this project while still a pre-teenager, and catalogued the journey he took in researching it, writing it, and finally bringing it to press. He engaged the audience and the room was animated with an applause at the end of his remarks, awed by a 23-year-old who had already done so much for the elephantine cause.
Wijesinha, an environmentalist who was moderating the event, subsequently introduced the book launch’s chief guest: Gamini Jayawickrama Perera. In lauding Minister Perera, Wijesinha explained that being an advocate for elephants in Parliament was hardly an easy task, and yet it was one that Perera had assumed.
“To take up the portfolio of wildlife in Parliament means you are directly going up against your colleagues, since they are advocating for development. Development is very important, but we must remember that we share this country with our creatures.”
Before handing over the microphone to Perera, Wijesinha concluded by saying, “We must remember that nature doesn’t need humans, but humans need nature!”
Last up to speak, before a reception and opportunity to purchase books was Minister Perera.
His speech stressed the efforts Parliament was making, and what more it could do, to help elephants. And he concluded on a joking yet poignant note, bringing full circle the effect author Tharindu Muthukumarana was having on the conservation of elephants.
“I think Thamindu was once an elephant (in another life). And now, he’s been born again to save the elephants.”
