SLFP will gain power by 2020: Amaraweera

Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amarweera said his party will come into power in 2020 and they would contest general election as the UPFA.
The Minister was addressing a meeting at Tangalle recently.
He said they asked all UPFA organisers to work for the party but some of the SLFPers did not heed the party's instructions and even enrolled members to another party.
Those who were removed from organiser posts can once again join the party if they commit to party activities whole-heartedly, he said.
"A coalition regime would not come into power again because we intend to set up a regime of our own, the Minister said. He said a government could be formed with 113 seats. Selecting of candidates for the forthcoming elections was finished by 95 percent, the Minister said.
Minister Amaraweera said the SLFP has no crisis as a party. "It is a pure party led by its leader and President Mathripala Sirisena. We have selected candidates not involved in any corruption or malpractice," the Minister said.
He said a mud slinging campaign was going on in Hambantota district against him. “Those who cannot tolerate my political progress sling mud at me,” the Minister said.
