New accident ward complex for A’pura Teaching Hospital

The government will construct an accident ward complex at Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital which has been a long-felt need in the North Central Province.
The project is aimed at minimizing the number of deaths caused by traffic and other accidents, and to prevent people from becoming disabled, said Teaching Hospital Director Dr. Lionel Mohandiram.
The construction work of the building complex is scheduled to be commissioned by Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Rajitha Senaratne.
The proposed four storeyed building complex will cost Rs. 370 million. The project and the estimates have been approved by the Cabinet.
Dr. Mohandiram said under the first phase, the first two storeys will be constructed. In the ground floor, there will be a short staying ward with 29 beds.
In the second floor for males and females, there will be two wards consisting of 58 beds. The building complex will consist of a well-equipped operation theatre, x-ray room and other essential medical facilities and appliances, Dr. Mohandiram said.
He added that during Vesak, Poson and Esala festivals and during other poojas, thousands of pilgrims visit Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa. With this, the number of traffic accidents has also increased.
As such, the need of an emergency accident unit is vital. Construction work will complete by the end of 2018, Dr. Mohandiram said.
