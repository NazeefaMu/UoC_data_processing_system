Dullas resigns from Matara district leadership post

UPFA Parliamentarian Dullas Alahapperuma said that he would resign from the post of Matara District Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) leadership from today. Addressing a press conference at the political office of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in Battaramulla, Colombo yesterday, Alahapperuma said that he would send his resignation to the SLFP General Secretary and Party leader President Maithripala Sirisena.
The former minister said that he decided to resign from his party position as the party has decided to remove all electoral organisers of the Matara district who were elected at the election. He also said that so far no reasons have been given to the party organisers removed for their position.
Alahapperuma added it was a grave injustice.
He also said that those SLFP electoral organisers who had been removed by the party leadership are those who have a massive vote base whereas their successors had a poor vote base.
“These decisions are not taken to strengthen the SLFP but to dilute it,” MP Alahapperuma said. “We act as a team to protect the SLFP and we knew the repercusions we had to face. Whatever actions they take, we will not hesitate to take the required action to protect the SLFP,.”Alahapperuma added.
