Number of Pradeshiya Sabhas  in Nuwara Eliya district increased

The Nuwara Eliya and Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabhas will be divided into six Pradeshiya Sabhas, increasing the number of Pradeshiya Sabhas in the Nuwara Eliya district by another four, Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry Secretary Kamal Padmasiri said.
Speaking to the Daily News on Wednesday, the Secretary said a collective decision was reached in this regard on Tuesday at a meeting chaired by Minister Faiszer Musthapha and attended by the JVP, Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA) led by Minister Mano Ganesan and other upcountry political parties.
He said the Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha which has a population of about 210,000 would be divided into three Pradeshiya Sabhas and the Nuwara Eliya Pradeshiya Sabha, which has a population of about 190,000 would be divided into three Pradeshiya Sabhas. However, the Secretary explained that the current number of members in those respective areas will not increase as a result of the formation of new LG authorities. “That was the agreement reached,” he said. He said the political party representatives who took part in the meeting gave their verbal agreement to this arrangement, adding that those political parties were asked to make their recommendations in writing to the Ministry by next week. He pointed out that the upcountry Tamil Parties were insisting that those new local government bodies must be included in the upcoming LG polls.
“We held the Gazette indicating the number of members in each LG body due to this reason. It will be issued soon after we receive the written recommendations of the Political Parties,” he noted.
