GMOA warns of strike on January 30

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) is to launch an islandwide strike on January 30. The nature of the strike (token or indefinite) will be decided by the GMOA Executive Committee on January 29, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
He said that if the health authorities, especially the Health Secretary, responded positively before January 30 for the requests made by the GMOA during the past one and half years, there would be no strike.
