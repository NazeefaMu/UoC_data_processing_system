Budget 2018 includes visionary proposals

Budget 2018 includes far-sighted polices instead of plans to fulfil people’s instant fancies, Southern Province Governor Shan Wijayalal De Silva said.
“This year’s budget is rather special in comparison to many financial statements presented to Parliament in the recent past. Many of them were presented to satisfy short-sighted ambitions of the people. Minister Mangala Samaraweera in his 2018 Budget proposals has presented a number of far sighted policies to ensure sustainable economy,” he said..
“This year’s budget does not burden the public. Most people thought that there would be numerous imposes on people as the government reduced prices of several essential food items before the budget. But no such proposals were included in the budget as many predicted. Many sections of the society including scholars and experts in the field commended the budget proposals as a well-adjusted reformist budget,” he said.
He said the budget proposals have corrected many mistakes previously made. “Much progressive far-reaching policies have been introduced and the policymakers have contemplated more over the country’s forward march than petty politics, he said.
“The budget proposals ensure the forward march of the country. Blue and Green economic strategies were introduced instead of disastrous highly technological polices,” he said.
“Raising the per capita income up to US Dollars 5,000, creating one million job opportunities, attracting Foreign Direct Investments up to five billion dollars and doubling the country’s exports income up to $ 20 million are but a few of visionary proposals in the budget,” he said.
“The objective of the Budget 2018 is to achieve the goals of Vision 2025, the economic policy of the government.
People expect the proper implementation of the budget proposals.” he said.
