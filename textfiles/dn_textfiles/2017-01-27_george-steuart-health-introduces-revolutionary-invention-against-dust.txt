George Steuart Health  introduces revolutionary invention against dust  mite allergies to SL

George Steuart Health, the leading pharmaceutical solutions provider in Sri Lanka has yet again proved their aspiration to deliver the finest medical care to their customers across the island by introducing Allergoff- an allergen neutralizing spray which helps treat symptoms of house dust allergens related allergies.
The innovative formula used for this revolutionary product introduced by ICB Pharma Poland, helps relieve symptoms of house dust allergies and asthma and prevents disease progression while offering additional protection against contraction of allergies for both children and adults.
Designed to reduce exposure to allergens present in house dust, Allergoff has a dual action whereby it neutralizes the pathogenic effect of the allergen and reduces risk of inhalation by binding dust particles and lowering concentrations of allergens in inhaled air.
Studies conducted by Prof. Neelika Malavige attached to the Faculty of Medical Sciences of the Sri Jayewardenepura University, show that the house dust-mite is liable for about 80% of asthma and allergic rhinitis patients and about 30% of patients are allergic to indoor mold.
Allergoff, the breakthrough solution in house allergy management, has been voted ‘Product of the Year’ for two consecutive years and ‘Discovery 2013’ (Poland).
