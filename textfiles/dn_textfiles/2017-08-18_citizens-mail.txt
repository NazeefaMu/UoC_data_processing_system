Citizens' Mail

Fibre failure
Apropos Ravi Perera's guest column on August 15, I heartily endorse the comments therein, having gone through a similar experience with SLT.
One evening a person whom I later gathered was from ExpoLanka Mktg persuaded me to go for a new Fibre Optic Cable and for which I had to pay Rs.799 immediately for which no receipt was issued- only a brochure.
Thereafter, I paid Rs.6,000 to the SLT Havelock Town office on July 24 and for almost a month no one turned up to install it.
Finally, on July 21, two persons turned up and what followed thereafter was a comedy of errors- culminating in my telephone/internet being disconnected for almost a week! Different persons came at unannounced times and were totally unprofessional in carrying out their task. Although, I was promised a new landline telephone instrument and a cordless phone as well (as per the brochure) they came without it and finally it was only on my insistence they brought the same.
The landline phone was found to be defective from the very first day! Throughout this time, I had to keep phoning various numbers but no one answered the phone in what were normal office hours!
