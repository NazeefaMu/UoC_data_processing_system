Heavy rains increase Kalu Ganga water levels

Heavy rainfall in the Kalutara district has resulted in a rapid increase in the water levels of Kalu Ganga. As a result, many low-lying areas in the district have been inundated.
The Disaster Management Centre has also issued landslide warnings to nine Divisional Secretariats in the Kalutara District and the public have been warned to be vigilant in these areas.
The areas are Bulathsinhala, Yatagampitiya, Delmella, Pasgoda, Palindanuwara, Agalawatte, Ingiriya, Walallavita and Mathugama.
On Wednesday evening, the Kukuleganga spill gates were opened affecting those living downstream in Agalawatte, Bulathsinhala, Ingiriya and Madurawala.
The rains over the past few days have caused havoc in the district with sectors such as farming, fishing and rubber cultivation coming to a complete standstill.
The district’s vegetable cultivations too have been greatly affected as a result of the rain.
