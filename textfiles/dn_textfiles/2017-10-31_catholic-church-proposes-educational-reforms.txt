Catholic Church proposes educational reforms

Father Ivan Perera laid out a list of proposed educational reforms sought by the Catholic Church in Sri Lanka, including lifting the ban on the establishment of schools by anyone other than the government and allowing both public and nonpublic sectors to manage schools, at the Archbishop’s House Auditorium on Friday.
Delivering the Thomas Cardinal Cooray Memorial Oration 2017 on the topic ‘Catholic Schools in a Changing Social Environment’, Father Perera, the National and Archdiocesan Director of Education, insisted that the government’s strict control over education had not been successful.
“In spite of the government monopoly of schools, private schools, Pirivenas, unregistered English medium schools, and international schools are proliferating. These schools seem to deliver education that is required in keeping with today’s employment market, as well as social and cultural requirements.”
He said the state monopoly of education had been rejected by many countries, and that in Sri Lanka, it has not yielded the desired results.
“We need free schools and we need free education, and we support it. But we need new policies which would give more control to schools in implementing a pragmatic financial regime which is controlled internally by school managements.”
He added: “The ban on the establishment of schools by anyone other than the government should be lifted, and some sensible rules should be adopted for ensuring proper standards. Both public and nonpublic sectors should be permitted to manage schools.”
In addition to these reforms, he requested that the government allow Catholic schools to fundraise for themselves, bring in foreigners to teach, and appoint priests and nuns as principals.
“These proposed reforms were originally composed for a memorandum submitted by Father Perera’s office to the subcommittee of the Parliamentary Consultative Committee on Education,” Fr.Perera said.
