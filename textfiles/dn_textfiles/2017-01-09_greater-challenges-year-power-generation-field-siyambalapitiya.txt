Greater challenges this year in power generation field:  Siyambalapitiya

We may have to face greater challenges in the power generation field this year due to the climatic conditions in the recent past. Therefore, three papers will be submitted to the Cabinet on measures to be taken to overcome those challenges, Power and Renevable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.
He was addressing a meeting after opening a new office for electricity demand management set up in league with the Sustainable Energy Authority at Albert Crescent, Colombo recently.
The minister said his ministry had prepared itself to face a future power crisis almost an year ago by setting a presidential task force headed by the secretary to the President.
Today the cheapest energy in the world was solar energy. We could easily move away from fossil fuel by changing over to power management and depending on solar energy.
He said life was full of challenges. Life would be dull without challenges. He was confident that his ministry could overcome the challenges through consensus, unity and discussion.
Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera, Ministry Secretary Suren Batagoda and several officers participated.
