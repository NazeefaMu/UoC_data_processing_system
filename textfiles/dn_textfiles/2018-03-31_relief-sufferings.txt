Relief from sufferings

Sakyamuni Siddhartha Gauthama Buddha the all-wise all compassionate teacher, born with love for humanity spread light to the entire universe with his vision insight philosophy and innermost feelings. He acted as a profound guide to millions of people. He could divert his divine eye, a countless number of times on the lives of human beings and their journey in the Sansara, to come to their aid and relieve them of their sufferings. In the fifth year of his supreme enlightenment while he was at Jetawanarama Sri Lanka had caught his divine eye. He foresaw a great disaster in Northern Sri Lanka Nagadeepa. Sakyamuni with his overwhelming compassion arrived in Nagadeepa to settle a dispute, an event of great historical importance.
Divine Vision
His divine vision attracted his attention to avoid the human destruction resulting from a war between Mahodara and Chulodara, uncle and nephew who were at loggerheads over the ownership of gem studded throne. Mahodara was on the verge of declaring war when Sakyamuni appeared immediately for their good fortune, which happened to be the month of Bak. Here the inhabitants belonged to various tribes such as yakka and naga. Naga being superior supported the Naga king who with their poor intellect and pure ignorance opposed the Buddha at the beginning. They soon realised they were wrong as they just could not give into their wishes. Finally they were blessed with the message of Dhamma, which was later welcomed by them.
Merit bestowing Umbrella
A deity named Samiddhi Sumana who had made a banyan tree referred to as Rajayathana Kiripalu Rukha his abode in Jethavana accompanied the Buddha holding the uprooted tree as an umbrella to him. Knowing that if was a merit gaining act to the deity. On arrival Naga kings involved in fighting the Buddha being the topmost with wisdom and insight with his psychic powers appeared above in the sky performing miracles which made the Naga astonished and happy. Finally having listened to the sermons displaying the path to peace and tranquillity they worshipped the Buddha and within minutes the throne was offered to him becoming pious devotees.
Nagadeepa Seya
The Naga king Maniakkitha, the ruler of Kelaniya who had become a devotee of the Buddha during his first visit to Mahiyangana while on his way to help Chulodara Mahodara in the battleground thanked him profusely for settling the dispute. He further requested for a souvenir and the Buddha offered him the Kiripalu tree and the throne. History reveals that where the Kiripalu Rukha was planted a chetiya named Nagadeepaseya, was built enshrining the Minipalanga that of Chulodara and Mahodara. This is supposed to be one of the 16 most sacred places to be worshipped in Sri Lanka History records that it was re-constructed and developed in to the present position by pious kings like Devanampiyatissa and Dutugemunu. According to the Golden Sannasa Wallipuram written during the reign of king Vasabha, it is the present Jaffna Peninsula that was identified as Nagadeepa.
Invitation to Thathagatha
When king of Kelaniya Maniakkitha met Thathagatha on his second visit to Lanka at Nagadeepa he was very keen that the Buddha visits his kingdom too. With his love and compassion he arrived at Kelaniya later in the eighth year of his enlightenment. This honoured invitation had been made on a Bak Full Moon day paving the way for the third visit of the Buddha to this Darmadweepa.
The surrounding areas which highlight the importance of the Buddha’s visit to Nagadeepa during the month of Bak bear testimony to the extreme devotion and reverence to the Buddha. Some of them are villages known as Mallakam and Chunnakam, where flowers and incense were supplied for the worship of the Buddha. Further the Buddhist chronicles make mention of Puwangu DivayinaKa-ara Divayina, Manda Divayina as popular Buddhist villages in the area. One can well and truly say that the most sacred spot visited and blessed by the Buddha occupies a unique place in the history of the island as a blissful place showered with peace and harmony among the people.
