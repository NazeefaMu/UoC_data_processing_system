At a felicitation ceremony today for the recently concluded 21st Commonwealth Games, held in Gold Coast, Australia, representatives of the Ministry of Defense praised members of the tri-forces who competed in the games. 
"The tri-forces have contributed much to bring honour to the country in the sports arena, and the Ministry is always ready to provide more support for sports development of the tri forces," said State Minister of Defence Ruwan Wijewardene.
The special felicitation ceremony was the idea of the State Minister as a way to express appreciation for the tri-forces sportsmen and sportswomen medalists who represented the country at the recently concluded Commonwealth Games.

Speaking at the ceremony, Secretary Waidyaratne also praised the feats of the medalists and said that we all should strive hard to bring more victory and honour to the country through sports in the future. Secretary to the State Ministry of Defence Samaraweera also conveyed his wishes to the medalists during the occasion.
The four medalists felicitated today were Able Seaman Indika Dissanayake (Sri Lanka Navy- Silver medal- Weight Lifting 69kg), Sergeant Chathuranga Lakmal (Sri Lanka Army- Bronze medal- Weight Lifting 56kg), Lance Corporal Ishan Bandara (Sri Lanka Army- Bronze medal- Boxing 52kg) and Leading Aircraftwoman Dinusha Gomez (Sri Lanka Air Force- Bronze medal- 48kg Weight Lifting/women).
The medalists were each presented with a special memento and a financial gift.

Four of the six medals won by Sri Lankan athletes at Gold Coast were won by tri-forces personnel.
Sri Lanka placed 31st in the medals table at the 2018 Commonwealth Games, with a total medal tally of six--one silver medal and five bronze medals. This was the highest number of medals the country has accumulated at the Commonwealth Games since their inception.
