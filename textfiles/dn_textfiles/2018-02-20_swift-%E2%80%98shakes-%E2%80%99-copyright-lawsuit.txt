Swift ‘shakes off’ copyright lawsuit

Taylor Swift can once again breathe easy after a judge dismissed two songwriters’ copyright lawsuit over her hit ‘Shake It Off’.
The 28-year-old singer enjoyed massive chart success worldwide with the catchy tune, which includes the lines: “Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play/And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.”
But in September 2017, songwriting duo Sean Hall and Nathan Butler filed papers claiming they came up with the line in a hit song they penned 16 years ago. In the lawsuit, the accomplished songwriters alleged that 20 per cent of Shake It Off is their 2001 song Playas Gon’ Play, recorded by girl group 3LW, due to the lyrics “Playas, they gonna play and haters, they gonna hate” - and sought substantial financial damages from Swift.
Swift filed to dismiss the case earlier this year, and on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Michael Fitzgerald agreed to do just that.
Fitzgerald looked at the lyrics of both songs as he analysed the case, and had to decide whether or not there was enough similarity between the two tunes’ protectable lyrics. Music News
