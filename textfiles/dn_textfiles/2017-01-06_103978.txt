Kiriella looks into issues of those who lost lands for Central Expressway

A special discussion to resolve problems of those who lost lands due to the construction of the Central Expressway was held at the Gampaha District Secretariat Office headed by Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella recently. While the majority of the problems were looked into, decisions were made to compensate those who lost their lands.
Minister Kiriella provided solutions to issues faced by the people.
The Minister said when the new government came into power, not an inch of land for the Colombo-Kandy Expressway was measured. But within the past two years, the Survey Department has measured the 22,000 blocks of land. The Divisional Secretariat Office, Valuation Department, District Secretariat have taken estimates, takeover measures for the 22,000 blocks of land, he said.
The minister said it is the people from the South who will benefit from this. Pilgrims can come to the Dalada Maligawa within an hour once it is completed, he said.
Nine Rajamaha Viharas were lost when the Mahaweli Development programme commenced. Over 100,000 families from Teldeniya, Kotmale and Kundasale left to settle in Giradurukotte. The expressway should have begun over 10 years ago, he said.
Defence State Minister Ruwan Wijewardena, MP Ajith Mannapperuma, MP Harshana Rajakaruna, MP Vijitha Herath, Higher Education and Highways Ministry Secretary D. C. Dissanayaka and Road Development Authority Chairman Nihal Sooriyaarachchi also participated.
