Over 300 principal’s vacancies in Uva

The Uva Province alone has 327 vacancies for principals, District Public Organization Alliance Chairman Upul Nishantha said.
He was addressing principals of the Moneragala Education zone during an awareness programme on sustainable development goals at the Victory Inn in Moneragala.
He said the vacancies should be filled to enure equal education for all by 2030 as of the agreement by the government with the United Nations.
He said the province has qualified teachers for principal posts. He said acting principals administer schools since many of the qualified teachers are reluctant to accept the posts.
He said the issue must be addressed soon.
