A little act to realise a BIG dream

The Little Hearts project is not new to the warmhearted Sri Lankans. Initiated by the s, the project aims at constructing a Cardiac and Critical Care complex at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital to treat children diagnosed of Congenital Heart Diseases (CDH).
Every year over 3,000 children are born with CDH. Each day throughout infancy is a battle to keep their little hearts beating. Those who survive infancy are restricted to a life of continuous medication, visits to the hospital, restrictive diets and worst of all, the inability to play or exert themselves like any other child.
Several generous organizations and civil groups have come forward to fund this worthy project. One such corporate is DSL Enterprises (Pvt.) Ltd. which together with its own subsidiary, Bluminz (Pvt) Ltd, introduced Speed Little Hearts Pens and Camlin Little Hearts Pencils last year. These pens and pencils are specially marketed to fund the Little Hearts project with 20 percent and 13 percent from the sales being donated respectively.
Introduced in September 2017 the sale of Speed pens and Camlin pencils has successfully increased over the past few months. As a result, DSL Enterprises has achieved Rs. 20 million, a testament to the confidence the public has on the cause. Pens and Pencils are commodities which are purchased regularly. As such, it is one of the simplest ways in which anyone can contribute to the Little Hearts project.
Commenting on the project, Dr. Duminda Samarasinghe, the Consultant Paediatric Cardiologist at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital urged the general public to make the conscious decision to purchase Little Hearts Pens and Pencils when they shop for stationary.
“When the Cardiac and Critical Care complex is completed, we will be able to save five children every day. This is our BIG Dream for the Little Hearts,” he said.
“We Sri Lankans are naturally passionate about causes such as these. Most often we are set back by the fact that we cannot afford to financially spare high amounts to support projects. With the Little Hearts Pens and Pencils, there is no need for second thought because you will be contributing in your own possible way by simply buying the Speed Pens and Camlin Pencils. It is heartwarming to know that each one of us can do our part and this is what we want all Sri Lankans to feel,” he added.
For DSL Enterprises, the Little Hearts Project in the most valuable project as it is a need of the time. Expressing his view, the Group Managing Director and Founder of DSL Enterprises (Pvt) Ltd, Asitha Wijerathne stated, “We are grateful to all our consumers, especially school children, who have continued to buy our Speed pens and Camlin pencils. As a team, we have wholeheartedly dedicated our resources and effort to achieve this goal and I thank my team as well as our stakeholders for their contribution so far. We are proud to hand over the first installment and look forward to reach our target very soon.”
At present over 250 million rupees has been accumulated through donors for the Little Hearts Project. It is further supported with another Rs. 170 million pledged from two organizations and Rs. 300 million allocated from the national budget by the Sri Lankan Government. The piling for the complex is set to commence in May 2018. The call for tenders for pile construction has been published in the newspapers on February 4 and the pre-bid meeting was held on February 20 of the same month. The Sri Lanka Navy will be responsible for construction and the complex is to be handed over to the hospital in November 2019.
