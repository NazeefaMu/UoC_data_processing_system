‘SLFP not made decision regarding NCM’

The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) had not yet made a decision regarding the no-confidence motion (NCM) against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe; the central committee of the party would decide the suitable cause of action, Fisheries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
He was addressing a tree-planting programme that was organised to coincide with International Day of Forests and held in Crow Island, Mattakkuliya, yesterday. The event was organised by the Mahaweli Development Authority, in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Coast Guard.
As Mahaweli Development Minister, President Maithripala Sirisena had been instrumental in initiating programmes to increase the country's forest coverage up to 39 percent, the minister said.
There have been significant weather pattern changes during the recent past. Two of the country's main harvest seasons, the Yala and Maha seasons, face difficulties due to these changes. We should investigate the reasons behind these changes and understand how they occur, he added.
Minister Amaraweera said the main reason behind this would most likely be deforestation.
