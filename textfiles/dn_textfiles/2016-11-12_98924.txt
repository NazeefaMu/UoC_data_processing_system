Pujara and Vijay lead India’s strong reply

RAJKOT FRIDAY : Cheteshwar Pujara and Murali Vijay hit centuries as India mounted a steady counter-attack on the third day of a high-scoring first Test against England on Friday.
Top-ranked India finished the day on a strong 319-4 at the Saurashtra Cricket Association ground in Rajkot, supported by the duo’s performance.
Pujara made 124 off 206 balls before being dismissed by first-innings centurion Ben Stokes, but owes his ninth Test century and third against England to the Decision Review System.
The right-handed batsman was ruled lbw on 86 but the TV umpire -- which long-time sceptics India are using for the first time in a home series -- overturned the decision after the ball-tracker showed Zafar Ansari’s delivery going over the top of the stumps.
Vijay hit 126 during a marathon eight-hour innings and shared 209 runs for the second wicket with Pujara.
Indian skipper Virat Kohli was batting on 26 at stumps while nightwatchman Amit Mishra was dismissed for a duck off the last ball of the day. The hosts trailed by 218 runs with six wickets in hand in reply to England’s 537, their third biggest total on Indian soil thanks to centuries from Joe Root, Moeen Ali and Stokes.
After being stuck on 99 for 10 balls, Pujara reached the three-figure mark with a nervous single as his father and wife applauded from the stands. AFP
