Veteran Coates in bitter battle to stay AOC chief

Sydney Friday : Australian Olympic Committee chief John Coates faces an unprecedented challenge to his decades-long presidency from newcomer Danni Roche Saturday after a bitter campaign marred by bullying claims goes to a vote.
Coates, whose International Olympic Committee vice-presidency is attached to being AOC president, has held the powerful office for 27 years.
But in an acrimonious lead-up to the AOC annual general meeting in Sydney there have been allegations of a culture of bullying and intimidation inside the lavishly resourced body.
Australia’s 40 Olympic sports, 11 AOC executive members and two delegates from the AOC athletes’ commission will decide whether to entrust the future of the country’s Olympic movement to Roche or keep it in the hands of long-serving incumbent Coates.
Roche, 46, a former Atlanta Olympic field hockey gold medallist and board member of the federal government-backed Australian Sports Commission (ASC), has campaigned for change in the AOC, saying the administration is dictatorial and bloated
Roche has also said she plans to cut costs and redirect money to athletes and underfunded sports in a shake-up of AOC culture.
One bone of contention is the more than Aus$700,000 (US$526,000) annual salary for Coates, who is also chairman of the co-ordination committee of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
“I am deeply concerned about the culture at the Australian Olympic Committee,” Roche said.
“On the day I announced I was standing for the role, I made a commitment to reset the philosophy and culture of the AOC.
“The need for change at the AOC is now clear. It needs to change, and it needs to change now.”
Coates, 66, points to his achievements as the AOC president.
He secured the 2000 Olympics Games for Sydney and helped build an Australian Olympic Fund which is now worth more than Aus$140 million and keeps the AOC financially secure and independent from federal government interference.
“I have a history of having a go,” Coates said. “Someone has to go out there and fight for the sports.”
A backdrop to the acrimonious square-off between Coates and Roche is the breakdown of the relationship between the AOC and the ASC, that funds the preparation of Australia’s Olympic teams.
“They are appointed by ministers to the ASC. I’m not. The AOC is independent,” Coates said.
Allegations of bullying have been splashed across Australia’s front pages, mostly linked to Coates’ right-hand man and media chief Mike Tancred as the AOC faces increased public scrutiny.
Former AOC chief executive Fiona de Jong brought one claim, alleging Tancred issued a “highly detailed and personal threat” against her.
Tancred has denied any wrongdoing but stepped aside while an independent commission rules on de Jong’s bullying complaint, which dragged Coates’ operating style into the spotlight.
Roche said she expects a close result in Saturday’s poll.
“I think the vote will be very, very close, I think it will come down to the wire,” Roche told reporters Friday.
“It has been a very big six weeks but a special six weeks. I have had the opportunity to speak to all of the sports about their challenges and opportunities.”
