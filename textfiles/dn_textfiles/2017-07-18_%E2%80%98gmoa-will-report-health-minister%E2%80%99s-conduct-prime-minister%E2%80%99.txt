‘GMOA will report Health Minister’s conduct to Prime Minister’

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) will inform Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in writing about the conduct of the Health Minister aimed at undermining discussions in connection with SAITM, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Releasing a statement after a press conference at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the GMOA held a discussion with the coordinating group of the Prime Minister on the conduct of the Health Minister.
According to Dr. Aluthge’s statement, the Health Minister is trying to show that the SAITM issue is over with nationalising Dr. Nevilli Fernando Hospital. He is trying to legalise SAITM. He distorted the facts discussed, Aluthge said. The minister is also trying to form a trade union dividing the doctors community into sections. He tries to justify suppressing trade unionists and students’ unionists.
The GMOA hopes that the Prime Minister will not let the Health Minister sabotage discussions aimed at getting a permanent solution to the SAITM issue, he said.
