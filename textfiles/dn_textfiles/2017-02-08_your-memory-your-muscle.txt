Your memory, your muscle

Human beings and a few of our quadruped friends have been endowed with the gift to remember the past. Legend tells us how the dog of warrior Ulysses recognises him on his return, wags its tail and closes its eyes. Androcles is spread by the lion as a gesture of gratitude. King Dutugemunu's royal tusker 'kadol' bad kept a pebble in his mouth to remind him of a wrong done by a kings warrior. To avenge when the time comes. He spits it out when the warrior saves him from a bucketful of 'Lo Diya'. Conies remember where they had hidden bones.
But, Man, the most consummate of beings has the ability not only to remember, but also to recall happy and sad events encountered by him from childhood to grave. They are memories. At times memories linger and are rarely forgotten.
Memories can be vividly brought to light, in a dream, with ones eyes closed, alone or in the company of others. Memories of happenings in ones life, be they be in the family, in school, workplace, in ones own country or abroad and interesting events in history, achievements and catastrophies are recorded in our memory and could be played back in a second, amidst laughter and tears.
Let us begin with momentous memorable memories. Memories of the moment when one becomes a grandparent. Memories makes one to peruse the old albums. Memories when one takes the vows of marriage. Snapshots of nuptials of children. The unforgettable memories of cutting the wedding cake by a child. The tearful embrace of the daughter before leaving the home sweet home of the parents to build her own nest with her partner. The final wave aboard the gaily decorated car will make the golden album to shudder with vibrant memories that flood ones minds eye.
You are seated with the children and grandchildren at the sea shore. Suddenly memories when as an engaged couple, you walked with your partner and recalls, the incident when an unexpected wave, drenches both. Laughter unlimited that cause you to relate the memorable shower bath incident to the children.
Happy memories of squabbles. About the marriage counsellor saying that marriage is not a bed of roses. That it has thorns too'.
A sight of a mother feeding her babe makes one to go back to the time when a persons own mother fondled her child. There are also incidents that are best forgotten.
Then comes the absolutely resplendent memories of happenings that took place from childhood to the present. These memories are more poignant when seated by a kin of friend peacefully sleeping in a casket. Vivid memories while gazing at an eternally sleeping persons.
There will be no memories without moments, with its suffixes momentous memorable, momentarily. At time angry tearful moments.
Finally, while taking a walk down a silent, serene, sorrow soaked pathway, gazing at the majestic, magnanimous writings from our holy books, memories rush into our minds. Here we see 'in memoriams' memorials that eulogises the meritorious deeds of a mortal by way of graphite or concrete slabs, statues and lovely memorials making us to go down once again down memory lane. Now for a memorable happening steeped in unfathomable memories.
A very young officer had trespassed into enemy territory. He was to face the firing squad. His eyes blindfolded and hands were tied behind a post. The firing squad was ready. Is there anything you wish to say before you die? “asked the commanding officer. The 18 year old thought. “Sir, I wish to relive a memory. When I was 8 years old, I injured my head. I ran up to my mother with extended arms, blood streaking down my face. She too came running towards me with arms outstretched.
We embraced each other. My blood was mingling with our tears”. “Sir, I can relive that moment while my eyes are blindfolded. “Please untie my hands. I want to relive that memory when we embraced each other. I want to embrace when I die! The CO Was silent, next he shouted. 'Ready, aim”. He stuttered. Halt! We cannot shoot is mother, She is embracing him.
We have all had mothers. Some of you have mothers. All of us have had unforgettable memories with mothers'. The boy was escorted by a weeping and happy firing squad to the border. Unforgettable memories saved a life. It also brought back memories of mothers to many.
Verily, memories are made of these.
