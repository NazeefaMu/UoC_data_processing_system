Soft skills development program on June 22

Having understood the core competency gaps in the corporate sector, 3rdwave Academy has taken the initiative to conduct a special soft skills program
The program will be facilitated by Sulakshana which will be held on the June 22. Sulakshana is a well experienced, certified trainer by City and Guilds and possess a degree in psychology, which has inspired more than 5,000 individuals across Asia.
Whilst hard skills could be developed via academic education, soft skills needed by employees to do their jobs more effectively are not freely taught through schools or universities. In order to take advantage of one’s core hard skills, understanding and learning soft skills is essential.
For instance, a sales person will only succeed in his career if he has the right balance between product and market knowledge and the ability to close and retain a sale through effective interpersonal skills.
In Sri Lanka when looking at the corporate sector, more than 50% of the employees lack the core competencies of soft skills. Thus, in order to enable the future generation is geared up and can perform more efficiently it is vital to have the right set of skills. Thus, soft skills will help you create the difference.
