Qatar Airways rolls out double beds  in business class

Qatar Airways is the first airline in the world to unveil a double bed in its brand new business class suite, the Qsuite.
The Qatari airline is a global pioneer when it comes to luxury sky-high - and it has a brand new aircraft section to prove it. Qatar Airways has just launched QSuite, new business class seating which provides passengers with all the comforts of a good night’s sleep on the ground.
The suite features a fully reclinable double bed enclosed with partition panels which ensure guests unrivalled privacy. (express.co.uk)
