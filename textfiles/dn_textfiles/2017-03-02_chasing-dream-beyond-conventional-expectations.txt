Chasing the dream beyond conventional expectations

History will record the long drawn out Dialog rugby season 2017 all done and dusted bar the shouting or our incredibly busy, fat lady singing?
The drama that unfolded during the season carrying on regardless of reputation and petitions to the gods on Olympus.
I have always encouraged players never to seek divine favours if they are unable to rely on their given skills and temperament.
Theories and various references to history are yet to confirm any divine fan support for the XV format or for individual clubs around the world.
Kandy proved their distinct power and professionalism in the league, to come from behind and less points by week 10…and clinically defend their 2016 title at Havelock Park, despite massive home support for the Havies and some scintillating rugby all the way down to the wire.
The win couldn’t have been sweeter when Danushka finisher Ranjan, ran in a signature try from 50metres out, powering his way past desperate tackles with a hand off that has Fijian class stamped all over it.
But that was not the end of it ...Nishon Perera scored a cracker to thrill the park ...bouncing off and slipping through 3 tacklers who thought they had him ..the pendulum swung again ...could Havies somehow shape an impossible win in the last 10 minutes of regulation time? The question was asked and with 5mins left, an answer by super sub Sooriyabandara showing such fast feet and genuine pace from his 22metre line... simply blew the Havelocks out of the park.
Soori B left the Havies line defence in shredded bits to score the scorcher that clinched the league and total euphoria for the diehard Nittawelians - the job well done and team pride for persistence and belief that shouted class and professionalism.
Rugby in Sri Lanka assumes new dimension and stature as the Singer schools season dramatically kicked off last weekend ...with absolutely all sorts going on....shocking the public and throwing the league into a tail spin. What next ...was popular thinking islandwide?
If the SLSRFA in the now familiar manner announced a lunar shuttle service to Mars starting in March ...schools would ask how much the flight costs ..? All plans changed with 48hrs to launching the 2017 season …12 confirmed contenders were informed that a 13 was added and D S Senanayake is in group 1- A. The joy down Gregory’s Road would have been short and sharp as the teams were read out..defending champions Isipathana, Royal, St. Peter’s, St Joseph’s, Dharmaraja, St Anthony’s + D S Senanayake make this the toughest by miles and each game a cauldron of pressure and adrenaline.
History is being rewritten as we speak and much will unfold as the fixtures line up ...Peters survived against Anthony’s, Patana were pushed all the way by Dharmaraja and Royal found out how much the new look Joes can step up this season.
What happened with the Wesley-Trinity opener is exactly what we dread most and prompt action vital to everybody that loves and believes in the code.
We need to pressure the stake holders to establish a CCTV systems at all venues, so that authorities and police have solid evidence on film, plus there needs to be plain clothes officers deployed at matches to deter and note potential trouble makers.
The consensus is incident free rugby for school kids and families to enjoy ...and the threat level down to zero...this is a game and we simply cannot accept anyone being at risk.
Chances are too risky to contemplate and I rather think there must be intervention and assurances that are legally binding ...it’s outrageous to imagine a 100million rupee tournament unable to keep safety of players and spectators as their no 1 priority, apart from the game in the middle.
I think they should be proactive and cure this ailment in the shortest possible time, assure the public it’s sorted and insist that players follow the rules or risk bans and prosecution - as I am sure you all agree, what we saw with that Trinity-Wesley match was the last of its kind.
We need to enjoy the skills and strategy on show in the middle and be enthralled by the performance levels of our young warriors, and not have to consider anything else beyond the game in the middle ...fair?
Further across the open seas, the RBS 6 Nations presented another huge weekender and much to contemplate about the quality of northern hemisphere rugby ...plus mesmerizing prospects for the British Lions summer of pain down under.
England has now stepped up to a league of their own...currently on a 17 game winning streak that will challenge the All Blacks18 game record that seemed untouchable and almost unreachable....
Ireland, England and Scotland showing excellent team form from the outset and much more to look forward to, given the hype and pre publicity about the quality of this year’s RBS tournament as the flagship for European rugby.
Sri Lanka is now looking at the Asian nations regional opener in 2 months with selections already making waves …especially with the Asian 7s series for wider delivery on the world stage.
We are listed to play as part of the Hong Kong 7s and gain much needed experience to be real contenders in Asia this season and improve our rankings to top 2 ...the women need to seriously upgrade skill and power to grade up from 6th to top 3 at least.
7s rugby is our future and I am hopeful that sanity will prevail with protecting our 7s specialists for the duration and not risk impact injuries in the XV’s competition this year.
I imagine the thinking to be considerate of risk and fatigue that will take the edge from these specialists ...it’s time to structure a full time system for the 7s and aim for a high performance future with Sri Lanka rugby.
The writing is on the wall..let’s hope and anticipate its top priority for us as we look to be a dominant force in Asia at 7s.
Cheers islanders.
