Uday Shankar who sired Indian fusion dances

A dedicated artiste’s life is full of struggles and hardships. Normally after a lifelong battle only the artistes’ sacrifices and their contributions which get some sort of social recognition. But even after their period, their great contribution and sacrifices are many often forgotten by the society.
Uday Shaker was born in the village of Udaipur in Rajasthan, in a rich Zamindahri Brahmin family on December 8, 1900. When he was young he travelled all over India. His father was in the state service, due to it, he got an opportunity to travel from one place to another place in different states. Finally, his family settled down in Jhalawar. When he was young he got numerous opportunities to watch a variety of dances, especially during the Holi festival time.
Numerous opportunities
These dances fascinated and influenced the young mind of Uday Shankar. During his childhood, he got an opportunity to live in different states of India including Rajasthan, Utter Pradesh and West Bengal. His father used to visit abroad, for numerous lecture tours. During his father’s absence, he went and stayed at his paternal grandfather’s house, where he got numerous opportunities to watch a variety of social, religious and cultural celebrations and festivals. All these functions and festivals influenced the young Uday Shankar’s mind.
During his younger days, with his friends, he led a carefree life by swimming in the river Ganga and viewing numerous street dances like Nautanki and Baiji. Anyhow his mother couldn’t control her son much, due to the restricted female freedom in those days. His mother had no daughters, so she adorned her elder son Uday as a female. Once he dressed as a woman and danced as a Rajasthan female dancer, but nobody realized that he was a male dancer.
All the ideas, which he gathered from the Indian celebrations, festivals and shows were deeply influenced in his subconscious mind. All these factors molded his own creativity in his artistic field. With the passage of time all the ideas which he gathered from his childhood, helped him to develop his own creativity dances in his later stage of his life.
Inborn talents
Many orthodox Hindu families didn’t accept his child hood pranks. Yet one of his art masters realized his inborn talents and helped him to cherish to develop his own talents. At the end of First World War, his father returned to India from London. And their family shifted to Jhalawar. His father noticed his son’s potential talents in painting and Indian instrumental music.
In 1918, he was sent to the J.J school of arts in Bombay. The principle of the J.J school of arts asked him to go and study magnificent drawing and painting at the British Museum. In 1920, Uday sailed to London to learn art at Royal art school, where his exceptional talent gained more recognition among the staff of the school. With the influence of certain Indians, he realized and understood the depth of the Indian culture. His studies and discoveries at the British museum further thrilled him.
During that time only he was deeply involved with Indian painting, Indian music, Indian musical instruments and Indian folk and Indian classical dances. He was the first Indian who won two prizes for his two portraits. Moreover, he got a scholarship to Rome where he got an opportunity to meet a Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova. Unexpectedly the fate brought them together. She requested Uday Shankar to choreograph a dance show; he also agreed to choreograph two dances. He danced with her and he became a dance partner for her dance shows.
Starting point
By his hard work, he finally choreographed two items, namely Radha- Krishna, and Hindu wedding. Both of these items were produced in London and gained the international fame. This was his starting point for his self-styled fusion dance career. Further, Anna Pavlova invited him to join with her, for her American tour. But unfortunately, less opportunity was given to him by Anna Pavlova during that tour.
Due to his disappointment with her, he left Anna Pavlova’s troupe as soon as he returned back. Then he returned to Paris and worked hard and practiced and rehearsed his own imaginative creativity dance based on rich Indian cultural and traditional links. During that period he was deeply influenced by Ananda K. Coomaraswamy’s Mirror of Gesture (English translation of Abiynayadarpana of Nandikeswara ). It further induced him to create his own dance with meaningful sense and essence.
Meanwhile, he got an opportunity to meet one French pianist, named Simon Barbiere who joined his troupe to help him in his orchestra and his dance troupe. In 1925, he performed at an International festival in Paris. This opportunity provided him to see further more dance forms of different other countries. All these dance forms influenced his creative mind. Meanwhile, his graceful creative dances also attracted the local audience of Paris, which provided him to display more dance shows in different parts of France.
Folk musical instruments
Later he returned back to India and studied the depth of Indian art and watched the performances of court dances and music recitals. He also collected beautiful Indian dance Jewellery, Indian research books and variety of Indian traditional and folk musical instruments. In 1938 he founded his own dance school, named Uday Shankar Indian Cultural Centre at Aloma in Uttar Pradesh. But during the Second World War period, this school was closed down and reopened in 1965.
He was very much taken up by the numerous folk dances and attracted by their aesthetic essence. He was very much attracted by Kathakali. He also saw the majestic magnified sculptures of Gods and temple decorative sculptural poses in temples and cultural chambers. He also visited Shantiniketan where he met Rabindranath Tagore.
After the Second World War Uday Shakar involved in the film industry and faced numerous financial crisis. With the passage of time in the 1960s, he moved to Calcutta, where he operated his own dance troupe. Later slowly and slowly his health condition started deteriorating. Once he was performing in Assam, he got a heart Attack and after one of his dance performances in the USA, on 26th of September 1977, at Calcutta, he passed away.
