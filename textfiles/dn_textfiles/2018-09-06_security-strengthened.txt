Security strengthened

Security was strengthened and additional Police personnel were deployed in Colombo yesterday ahead of the protest march by the Joint Opposition.
Security had been tightened near Temple Trees and some of the key government institutions. The public were highly inconvenienced due to the protest march during the afternoon rush hour and heavy traffic prevailed in roads leading from Colombo Fort.
