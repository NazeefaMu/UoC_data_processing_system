Sarana fined Rs. 2,000

Former Petroleum Industries Deputy Minister Sarana Gunawardena who pleaded guilty in two corruption cases filed against him by the Bribery Commission was yesterday ordered to pay a fine of Rs.2,000 by Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara.
This is the second time in Sri Lanka a politician was convicted by a Court over an offence that comes under the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law.
The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed two corruption cases in Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court against former Deputy Minister Sarana Gunawardena over the non-declaration of assets and liabilities while he was serving as the National Lotteries Board Chairman between 2006 and 2007.
