University admission registration date extended

The date of registration for university admissions has been extended by one week until July 7, UGC Chairman Prof. Mohan de Silva said. “This decision was taken in response to complaints that university entrance registration forms had not been received so far owing to the ongoing postal strike” he said. The closing date of registration was June 30 earlier.
