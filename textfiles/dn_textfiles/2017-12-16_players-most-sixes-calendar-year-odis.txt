Players with most sixes in a calendar year in ODIs

Men in Blue's opening warrior Rohit Sharma now has 45 ODI sixes to his name in the 2017 calendar year. He has been in sensational form this year and entertained the crowds with abundant big hitting.
The stand-in skipper for the limited-overs series against Sri Lanka has now surpassed former Aussie all-rounder Shane Watson's record of 42 sixes in 2011. Former Proteas captain AB de Villiers is at the top of the charts with a tally of 58 sixes to his name in the year 2015.
Rohit now has 162 sixes overall in ODI cricket which is also the fourth most sixes hit by an Indian batsman in the format. Considering his ability and the wide array of shots he holds in his arsenal, the right-hander is surely unstoppable when in fine touch. He also seems to be in a great mindset which is a good thing for the Indian team, before the start important overseas tour against South Africa next year.
De Villiers is on the top of another list of big hits with a total of 58 sixes to his name in 2015. Former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi is the second name in that list with 48 sixes in 2002, but keeping in mind that Rohit has one more game left in this year, he needs three sixes to go past the Pakistani cricketer's record.
The ongoing three-match ODI series between hosts India and visitors Sri Lanka has been a thrilling one so far and as opposed to the expectation the third match will be the deciding encounter.
So, therefore, India's Rohit definitely has the opportunity to add another feather in his record book and secure his first series victory as the leader of the pack. If the Men in Blue are able to win the ODI series, then this will be India's sixth consecutive ODI series victory this year on the trot.
