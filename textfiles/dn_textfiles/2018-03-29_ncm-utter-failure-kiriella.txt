NCM, an utter failure - Kiriella

The No-Confidence Motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will be defeated on April 4, Minister Lakshamn Kiriella said.
“The most obvious flaw of this whole act is former President Mahinda Rajapakasa opting not to sign the No-Confidence Motion which he himself submitted together with other Joint Opposition supporters,” Minister Kiriella pointed out.
Public Enterprise and Kandy Development Minister Lakshman Kiriella made these observations at the oaths taking ceremony of Kandy Local Government Council members of the United National Party.
“As the Leader of the House, I proposed to sign a letter of confidence in support of Prime Minister Wickremesinghe. 85 MPs signed the proposed letter only 15 minutes.Fifteen MPs who were abroad, expressed their confidence via email and Whatsapp. So it is very evident that this a No Confidence Motion will be an utter failure. We will definitely defeat this No Confidence Notion on April 4,” Minister Kiriella said.
Addressing the newly elected councilors, Minister Kiriella said that Local Governemnt councillors should make this opportunity to lay a strong foundation to their future political careers. Referring to LG Councils to be the “cradle of politics,” Minister Kiriella pointed out that great political figures such as former Presidents J.R. Jayewardene and R. Premadasa began and built their political careers at grass rotts level.
“Some LG councillors try to solve national issues. But your responsibility is to solve issues at rural level. They should learn how to treat people with dignity and respect. It is important that all of you understand your responsibilities as representatives of the village,” Minister Kiriella said.
