Disabled war heroes in pada yatra

A group of disabled war heroes launched a pada yatra from Anuradhapura to the Kataragama Kirivehera on November 25 demanding a presidential pardon for the war heroes imprisoned under the 2015 government.
They started the march from the Ruwanweli Seya after religious observances by the Maha Sangha led by Pothana Dhammanda Chief Sanghanayake Thera of the Northern and North Central provinces.
Former Provincial Minister K.H. Nadasena was present.
The group included war heroes Asela Dharmasiri, Nishantha Mihiraj, M.B.H. Kumara, R.W.V. Piyatissa and Sampath Kumarawansa. Mashushani Rajakaruna, daughter of Corporal Rajakaruna, who is in jail now, joined.
Asela Dharmasiri, who organized the march, said they would stop at the Kandy Sri Dalada Maligawa, Kelaniya Raja Maha Viharaya and Devinuwara Devalya for religious observances.
He said he expected more disabled war heroes to join the pada yathra on its way.
