Mahendran will be extradited - Minister

The new government will take measures to have former Central Bank Governor Arjun Mahendran extradited to Sri Lanka and charged for the Central Bank bond scam, Public Administration, Home Affairs and Justice Minister Susil Premajayantha said yesterday.
Addressing the media at the Prime Minister’s Office he said the new government intends to recur the loss the country suffered due to the Treasury Bond scam.
 “Yes definitely.This is a very simple thing. There are several others who are respondents in this issue and if the evidence recorded at the Bond Commission is to be used in courts, then we must pass the amendments that was brought to parliament, which was delayed, and through that we can make progress,” he said.
When asked if Arjuna Mahendran can be extradited to Sri Lanka, he said that there is provision under the extradition treaty between the two countries to have him extradited. “In the first place former PM Wickremesinghe should have known to keep him in the country and not let him leave, as he is the one who brought him here and appointed him as the Central Bank Governor.
Otherwise, he should have taken the responsibility to bring him back as he vouched for him and had him appointed. He made these mistakes and now we have to face the consequences and resolve it.”
