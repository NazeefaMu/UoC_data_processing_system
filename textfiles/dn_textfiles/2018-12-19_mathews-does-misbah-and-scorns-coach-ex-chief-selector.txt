Mathews does a Misbah and scorns at coach, ex-chief selector

Angelo Mathews had a sore point to prove after he was unceremoniously dropped from the Sri Lanka ODI squad for the five-match series against England in November and he displayed it in no uncertain manner soon after reaching his ninth Test hundred on the fourth day of the first cricket Test against New Zealand at Basin Reserve, Wellington yesterday.
Soon after Sri Lanka’s disastrous Asia Cup campaign where they lost both matches to Bangladesh and Afghanistan and was knocked out of the tournament in the first round, the selection committee headed by Graeme Labrooy that also comprised the head coach Chandika Hathurusingha as one of the selectors made Mathews the sacrificial lamb for the poor team performance and not only removed him from the ODI and T20I captaincy but also dropped him from the ODI and T20I teams against England on the grounds of fitness and accusing him of being a poor runner between the wickets.
Mathews challenged the decision by demanding a fitness test from the cricket authorities but it was denied to him.
Being a senior member of the team it was a bitter pill to swallow and Mathews took this rough blow on the chin and waited for the opportune moment to prove his point.
Yesterday at the Basin Reserve with Sri Lanka fighting to save the first Test against New Zealand, he came up with a spirited batting performance in the second innings with a century.
What followed soon after he had completed his hundred was eventful. Mathews removed his helmet and then got down to the business of doing several push-ups and then flexed his biceps at the dressing room to prove a point just how fit he is. Indeed the innings was not only about fitness but one of mental strength as well. Mathews and Kusal Mendis battled throughout the fourth day in a wonderful double century partnership denying the Black Caps of any success for the entire day and has given their team a chance to bail out of jail in the first Test.
Mathews’ reaction is reminiscent of former Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq who at the age of 42 hit a hundred in his first Test at Lord’s in 2016 and having being under pressure to quit was so pumped up that he took off his helmet, went towards the visitor’s balcony, saluted the dressing room and did as many as ten pushups to celebrate his tenth Test ton for Pakistan.
Cricket is a game full of characters, that’s what makes it so fascinating.
