Today is Dudley Senanayake’s 106th birth anniversary : Iconic statesman

Today, with the return to democracy, we think of the greatest liberal democrat of this country, the late Dudley Senanayake. As the anniversary of his birth dawns, it is inevitable that the thoughts of those of us who knew him well should linger on all that he was and did during his lifetime. Famed throughout our country and beyond our shores, as one who was far above the usual norm of politicians, a statesman who thought of the generations to come, and not of the next election.
All throughout his life, he abhorred violence, lies and deceit. His schooling at S. Thomas’ College, Mt Lavinia, discipline instilled at home and school, his university life at Cambridge, combined with his skills as a sportsman had ingrained in him a respect for law and order, justice, freedom and fairplay. Other qualities which shone right through his life were his total loyalty to his party at all times, whether in or out of politics. He was a deeply thoughtful, reflective, contemplative person of unchallenged integrity. His entire life was devoted to fighting for freedom and justice with vigour and determination. The way that people switch parties today at the drop of a hat would have shocked and displeased him.
Leading by example - motto
As Prime Minister, he bore the mantle at the pinnacle of power with patience, fortitude and grace. Leading by example was his motto. All his life, Dudley worked hard to achieve ethnic amity, never thinking of his fellowmen in terms of labels and categories.
Today’s society epitomises the dishonest, self-seeking, snatch and grab winner takes it all mentality, which seems to deprive the country of all ethical values. It is filled with divisive labels which seemed to be designed to wound others.
The dialogue today has been replaced by name-calling that is little related to truth. Loose talk and malice in the arena of politics, reduces different issues to slogans and stops us regarding others as worthwhile individuals. Dudley Senanayake always held firm to the belief, that all ethnic groups had similar hopes and dreams. He would have been appalled at the recent attacks on Muslims and their places of worship.
He knew that labels and categories often hide the truth, injure, wound, create fear and manipulate people. He did not believe in the loose talk that so many politicians indulge in today.
Words that make us suspicious of other races can create enemies and adversaries. That is why he refrained from such talk all his life. The great statesman that he was, he knew that any label or category that diminishes the worth of another diminishes the worth of those who use such terms. He was steadfast in his belief that each one should be honoured, according to their own worth, not categorised, penalised or suspected, because of their race, creed or class.
He never clung to power, would have hit out strongly, against those defeated at the pinnacle of power, which still hankers after the grandeur of that position. Their selective amnesia about their record of unprecedented, corruption, abuse of power and extravagance with state funds would have shocked him beyond words. His thinking right throughout was that of a liberal democrat, and the freedom of the individual, to follow whatever path he believed in.
A reluctant politician
Dudley was known as a reluctant politician, who walked the straight path, never deviated from this route and never used power to inflict pain on anyone.
His wit and humour were unsurpassed in parliament although his fellow MPs at the time were some of our political giants. They were in a class by themselves as speakers, most of them educated at British universities. Their standards, values and principles were different to what one sees today. The speeches in parliament in that era were outstanding. The use of language was like music to one’s ears, unlike the speech and behaviour one sees in that most august assembly today.
Even in that era of political giants, Dudley was the colossus of his time from every aspect.
He had simple tastes. He loved music, reading, photography, driving his little Triumph Herald around, even when he was Prime Minister and relaxing with his miniature dachshund at home. His love for food is legendary. He filled a room with his presence, his laughter, geniality and charisma. The added natural charm made him the most loved politician of our time. He loved the good things of life and never made a secret of it.
To me, the most important things about him, which I believe all leaders should possess are his unchallenged integrity and his loyalty to his party, through bad times and good. These qualities are possessed by the present UNP leader too. No allegations of dishonesty ever slurred his name.
His funeral remains today unprecedented in the vast numbers who mourned his loss. Never in the history of our nation, have we seen such a mass of humanity, gathered for a single purpose. It was a crowd that rose above political affiliations. One and all, the people of Sri Lanka, seemed aware that they had lost a national treasure, and that our weeping nation would never be the same again. He lived all his life in his father’s house, never built mansions or purchased any abroad.
I am proud that the UNP leader today also still lives in the house, built for him by his parents, and has not amassed wealth. Integrity is the greatest possession one can have and lives on after death. Dudley Senanayake lives on in the hearts and minds of people because of this and his loyalty to his party. He was alert to the mistakes and consequences of history, believed in a world dedicated to freedom and peaceful co-existence, his life was a mission of goodwill.
He was an unstoppable, immovable pillar of democracy.
