SLPA posts Rs.13 billion profit for 2017

Sri Lanka Ports Authority has made a record profit before tax of Rs. 13.2 billion for the financial year ending December 2017 as against a profit before tax of Rs. 1.04 billion recorded in 2016.
The accounts were approved by the Board of Directors at its meeting held on February 23.
Prudent measures adopted in areas such as reducing the debt burden, enhancing container volumes handled and mitigation of possible increase in costs had resulted in this achievement. During the year 2017, Port of Colombo handled a record volume of Rs. 6 million TEUs. It is also ranked as the 15th most Connected Port in the world.
The growth trajectory has continued with the Port of Colombo recording an overall container volume growth of 16.4% in the month of January 2018 and transshipment volumes increased by 20.2% as against the corresponding period in 2017.
