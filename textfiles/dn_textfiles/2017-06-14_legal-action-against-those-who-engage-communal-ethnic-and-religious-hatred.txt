Legal action against those who engage in communal, ethnic and religious hatred: Prime Minister [Video]

 
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe today said that the Cabinet of Ministers has decided to instruct the Police to take legal action against those who engage in communal, ethnic and religious hatred, violence and hate speech.
He said further that if someone engaged in communal, ethnic and religious hatred and violence and hate speech, measures would be taken to inquire, arrest and produce the person before court.
He also said that if necessary that new laws would be passed by the Parliament.
He made these observations today making a special statement to the media at the Temple Trees.
He also said that the act was an reaffirmation of the policy of the National Unity Government headed by President Maithripala Sirisena, in accordance with the mandates received from the people at the Presidential elections on January 08, 2015, to ensure that our nation never again returns to a conflict-ridden past, and instead resolve to guide our nation towards reconciliation.
He added that we have decided to get together and march forward after the end of the 30 year prolonged war.
He also said that accordingly all the Police stations and related institutions have been informed to maintain law and order.
"I am proud to be Sinhala Buddhist, in the same manner I am proud to be a Sri Lankan. As a Sri Lankan, I respect all religions and cultures. If someone hates other religions and cultures, he cannot be accepted as a Sri Lankan. The good governance government would guarantee equal rights and ensure an environment that all could live peacefully,” said the Prime Minister.
