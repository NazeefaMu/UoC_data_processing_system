MAHINDA RESIGNS, RANIL PM TOMORROW

Ranil Wickremesinghe will be sworn in as Prime Minister tomorrow (16) at 10 am along with his new Cabinet.
Kurunegala District MP Mahinda Rajapaksa will resign from the Prime Minister post today after making a special statement. MP Lakshaman Yapa Abeywardena told the media that former President Rajapaksa made this announcement at a group meeting of all UPFA MPs held at the Presidential Secretariat with President Maithripala Sirisena last night.
Rajapaksa had said that he had arrived at this decision in the best interests of the country. “If I were to continue in the Prime Minister’s post, that would cause instability in the country,” Abeywardena said quoting Rajapaksa. He has also pointed out that the President would be in a difficult position, if he did not resign from the Premiership, Abeywardena added.
