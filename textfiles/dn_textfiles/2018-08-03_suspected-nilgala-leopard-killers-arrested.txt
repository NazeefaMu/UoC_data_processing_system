Suspected Nilgala leopard killers arrested

Two persons suspected to be those who poisoned the three leopards at Bowella, Nilgala, in the Gal-Oya National Wildlife Park in Bibile on July 31 have been arrested by Nilgala Wildlife officers yesterday.
The suspects were residents of Bowella in the Pitakumbura area and were to be produced before the Bibile Magistrate.
The carcasses of three leopards endemic to Sri Lanka and also listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List were found by Police and Wildlife officers on a tip-off.
The remains of the two young leopards, aged around two years, and an adult female leopard of five feet in length and three feet in stature were sent for further analysis. The female leopard is believed to be the mother of the cubs.
Karandugala Police led by OIC IP H. M. Udayapala and officers of the Galoya National Wildlife Park led by Pradeep Munasinghe are conducting further investigations.
