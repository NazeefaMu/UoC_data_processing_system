 I had the opportunity to serve President Premadasa as the Chairman and Director General of the Greater Colombo Economic Commission and also as the First Chairman of the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka from '91 to '93 and prior to that as the Chairman of the People's Bank at a very young age. It will be appropriate for me to write about the economic developments undertaken during this period especially the 200 Garment Factories Programme and the poverty alleviation Janasaviya Programme on the 24th death anniversary of President Premadasa.
The 24th death anniversary of late President R. Premadasa falls on May 1. It is sad that the country lost a dynamic leader who was action and result oriented and had the vision to spread economic development throughout the country by taking the garment factories to the villages and providing jobs to rural youth, which resulted in the upliftment of the economy in the rural sector.
As chairman of the People's Bank during the period of President Jayewardena and continuing during the President Premadasa, I was closely associated in the implementation of pro poor and inclusive programmes such as direct lending to self-employed, small scale and micro projects through the People's Bank and its network of branches spread throughout the country. The new concept of President Premadasa for the banks was to set up Praja Naya Niyamakas (PNN) who were given a loan of Rs 100,000 by the bank on provision of security and to on lend small amounts of loans ranging from Rs 500 to Rs 10,000 per person for micro projects. Further the rates of interest charged by the PNN and the on lending rate was recommended by the bank to enable the people to get loans at a very much reduced rates compared to the money lenders who charged exorbitant rates.
Two of the major programmes launched by President Premadasa in which I was able to make a contribution were the Janasaviya or the poverty alleviation programme when I was chairman of the People's Bank and the 200 garment factories programme as the chairman and director general of the BOI, both of which had a direct impact on the upliftment of the rural economy.
Both these programmes made a significant contribution to the economic emancipation of the rural people which comprised 70% of the population of this country.
Janasaviya programme
President Premadasa was one who had feeling for the common man and reached out to uplift their living conditions in many of the programmes, such as the housing development projects, supply of drinking water and electricity and annual Gam Udawa celebrations which culminated in the many development projects completed in the area. Although giving free handouts were the order of the day, President Premadasa was able to change this concept by pushing economic development to the provinces by inviting the private sector businessmen to set up garment factories in the rural areas. Preference was given to Janasaviya certificate holders in the granting of jobs and this enabled the people to earn a wage rather than depend on free handouts. He was also able to activate the state banking sector to play a lead role in the Janasaviya poverty alleviation programme.
This was one of the thrust projects of the government and was handled by a separate ministry. However, the two state banks - the People's Bank and Bank of Ceylon - were called upon to play a major role in these two schemes. In fact, I remember that when the late President was the Prime Minister, he summoned me as the Chairman of People's Bank and Dr Nimal Sandaratne, the Chairman of the Bank of Ceylon to a meeting at the Sucharitha and wanted us to come up with a proposal to set up agency banks in the AGA divisions to provide small sector loans at the door step of the villager.
This meant that villagers would not have to come to banks and fill lengthy forms but could use the agency banks to obtain their loans without going through the normal lengthy procedure applicable to the grant of loans. These agency banks were named Praja Naya Niyamaka (PNN). The banks were to identify persons to be appointed as agents of PNN who could undertake the task of lending money to the people of the area.
They had to provide security for the money advanced by the banks at normal interest rates and they were to on lend at rates of 2 to 3% per month which rate was very much lower than the rates charged by money lenders which was 5 to 6% per month. The maximum money advanced to the PNN was between Rs. 50,000 to 100,000.
The Janasaviya scheme was implemented by both banks and was accelerated after the late President assumed office after winning the presidential elections. The People's Bank had appointed 4000 PNNs and the Bank of Ceylon a similar number.
The PNN scheme provided the opportunity for the rural masses another channel to obtain small sector loans. The private sector banks like the Sampath Bank also came up with a scheme for such small sector loans in certain selected areas and this was a scheme launched by late N.U. Jayawardena who was then the Chairman of Sampath Bank.
The People's Bank, which was set up mainly for the rural sector, at the inception was able to play a lead role in the setting up over 4,000 PNNs, grant of loans without security, self employment loans to youth, agricultural loans, start up loans, tiny sector loans, athamaru loans, pawning, Janasaviya loans, assisting the cooperatives and the cooperative rural banks.
The competition between the two banks also resulted in the rural sector benefiting and areas hitherto not visited by banks were targeted for the grant of loans. However, the People's Bank was able to overtake the Bank of Ceylon in the grant of loans in rural areas. The policies of the late President Premadasa resulted in change of attitudes of the staff of banks to go to the small man who was earlier neglected and meet their requirements rather than wait for the people to come to the banks and queue up and fill forms.
Today we find that many promises are made by politicians without having a proper implementation plan and later forgotten.
However, President Premadasa made it a point to monitor and evaluate performances of banks, ministries, departments and officials not only by verifying statistics but by sending his staff to visit the sites and give him a report after inspection.
This enabled him to find out the officials of ministries and corporations who worked tirelessly to achieve results as well as those who bluffed their way through and enabled him to have an effective monitoring and control mechanism and also to take early remedial action.
200 garment factory programme
I was Chairman of the People's Bank and one evening I had a call from the then Secretary Finance Paskaralingam who told me that the President wanted me to take over the GCEC now BOI. This was quite a surprise and a challenge for me as I knew that the GCEC was quite different from the People's Bank which had over 350 branches and over 10,000 employees with a good cadre of senior management staff who were the best products turned out by our local universities.
However I had always accepted challenges and entered another new organisation which had a major role in attracting foreign direct investment, increasing exports, creation of jobs and the overall economy of the country.
There were many new changes taking place at the GCEC at this time. Some of the major projects and new regulations to promote investment were as follows.
• Setting up of the Koggala Export processing Zone,
• 200 garment factories programme,
• Conversion of GCEC to BOI,
• Grant of incentives for the first time for infrastructure projects were brought in compared to the earlier concept of only export oriented projects,
• Setting up of the One Stop Shop at BOI,
• Cabinet Sub Committee on Investment approvals
• BOI projects became the main export earner for Sri Lanka.
The 200 garment factories programme could be considered as one of the main achievements and contribution made by President Premadasa to uplift the rural economy of Sri Lanka with the help and support of investors in the private sector. Well organised factories were set up in the rural areas and the rural girls became a part of the export economy. For the first time we saw factories shifting out of the Katunayake and Biyagama free trade zones in the Colombo and Gampaha Districts to outside provinces.
The US garment quotas were utilised by President Premadasa as a strategic tool for developing the rural economy and to help alleviate poverty in Sri Lanka and was one of the main effective tools which provided a trickle down approach to benefit the poor man. The garment industry became the largest industrial export from Sri Lanka due to the vision of the late president. Workers who had to leave their villages and come to Colombo and Katunayake and stay in boarding houses with measly savings were now able to travel to work from their homes and have a substantial take home pay.
In fact governments which criticised the 200 garment factories programme when in the opposition, once in power commenced the 50 garment factories programme and other schemes thereafter which enabled to build the garment industry on the strong foundation laid down by President Premadasa. Even recently a new garment factory was opened in the Eastern Province.
The private sector was drawn into the 200 garment factories programme by giving tax incentives, infrastructure such as land, electricity, telephone, water, roadways and other benefits, quotas depending on the area selected to enable them to undertake expansions or new projects without much hassle and free of bureaucracy.
This was the era where the One Stop Shop concept for the approval and implementation of projects was carried out by the BOI. All approvals done under one roof by the BOI.
To undertake this project the late president selected the then Greater Colombo Economic Commission (GCEC) and converted it to the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka (BOI) in order that it would cover the entire country. This was a swift and significant change made within a few days and the Bill was approved by parliament.
Conversion of GCEC to BOI - The all powerful Government Agency to serve investors under the President
The BOI was used as the vehicle to achieve this massive task of setting up 200 garment factories which indeed was a dream come true due to the dynamic leadership provided by President Premadasa.
Since the BOI was directly under the president we found that we did not have any political interference and could work to achieve targets and goals according to set rules and regulations. In 1977 President J R Jayewardene heralded the Open Economic Policy, the Greater Colombo Economic Commission was set up to attract foreign direct investment, set up Free Trade Zones and promote export oriented projects. The GCEC/BOI was a very powerful organisation coming directly under the President and had the power of giving tax incentives, approval to open a foreign currency banking account and Customs functions for the imports and exports relating to GCEC/BOI companies. The first zone was set up in Katunayake and the second in Biyagama and the current Prime Minister who was MP for Biyagama played a major role in setting up the zone in Biyagama. Both Katunayake and Biyagama could be considered two of the very successful free trade zones in the world. President Premadasa set up the Koggala Free Trade Zone.
The success of the 200 garment factories programme was the grant of tax incentives, textile quotas and luxury vehicles which was carried out under BOI as per the applicable rules and regulations without any political interference. In fact President Premadasa did not tolerate any political interference and we hardly ran into problems with any of the politicians in the provinces where the factories were set up. The staff of the BOI and others who were seconded from various ministries played a major role in making the 200 garment factories programme a success. This indeed showed that given the right direction and authority, the public sector management could play a major role in the economic development of our country.
BOI was a one-stop shop where investors could come to one place for all their requirements. The numerous meetings that we had with investors, government ministries, banks chaired by the late president himself and others chaired by the finance secretary were action oriented to solve problems of investors and not talk shops.
Investors experienced a marked improvement in the business climate with President Premadasa and his Secretary Paskaralingam and other staff who were men of action and always result oriented. The private sector and foreign investors really appreciated such speedy action and was not pushed from pillar to post but were served from one centre. President Premadasa wanted men who could perform and those with the “Can Do’ approach and did not worry whether they were red, blue or green.
I remember the frequent meetings we had at Sucharitha where President Premadasa invited investors who were due to open their factories and solved any problems they had. Always at these meetings the Chairman of CEB, Roadways and Water Board were present as these were three items where investors complained: electricity supply, roadway and water supply.
The weekly meetings with the Cabinet sub committee was another vehicle which sorted out matters especially relating to transfer of land for BOI projects and many Cabinet papers were submitted for approval on the recommendation of the Cabinet sub committee.
The twin objectives of the trickle down benefits of the benefits of grass root level development and alleviation of poverty were achieved directly by the implementation of the 200 garment factory programme.
All factories under the 200 Garment Factory programme had a minimum of 500 employees in each factory in an electorate had a money circulation among the workers per month of Rs. 2.0 to Rs. 5 million. In addition all factories had to give the breakfast to the workers.
The target was 200 factories employing 100,000 youth and putting into the economy Rs. 500 million to Rs. 1 billion per month. The youth in the villages were for the first time producing export quality garments going to the main markets of USA and UK.
Credit should also be given to the USA government, as the late president was able to utilise the garment quotas given to uplift the rural economy and move industrialisation from the city to the village. Increase in quotas was also obtained to sustain the expansion, which took place. Even factories were set up in the north in Vavuniya and in the east in Batticaloa.
The then USA ambassador visited the opening of a garment factory in Puttalam with an OPIC investment delegation and they were highly impressed with what they saw. Thereafter, she also visited many other openings where USA investors had set up.
We also had investors from UK, Hong Kong, Singapore and Germany investing in factories in the rural areas hitherto not even thought of by any industrialist, local or foreign.
In the 200 garment factory programme the late president was present for all the official openings of factories and he gave opening dates to all investors and they had to work round the clock to open their factories on the scheduled dates. The opening of a factory was marked by the construction of a clock tower in all the areas which was undertaken by the investor and opened by the President before the factory opening.
At the initial stages it was slow but once started it was a hive of activity and industrialists were queuing up looking for sites to open factories. In fact the initial idea came from the late Kumar Dewapura who was the Chairman of the Tri Star Group. He was given a land in the Kurunegala district by the then Chief Minister Jayawickrema Perera and currently the Minister of Food to set up a garment factory and President Premadasa visited the factory and developed the concept of the 200 garment factories programme. Kumar Dewapura was instrumental in setting up of the first few factories and giving a lead for others to join in the programme. At the time of his untimely death of President Premadasa, 160 areas had been allocated to construct garment factories and 117 factories, all opened by the late president, six were ready for opening and 37 factories under construction.
Punctuality and meeting targets
Another special feature was that each town or village got a clock tower and this indicated that a garment factory had been opened in the area. Punctuality at the openings may be due to the clock towers that were constructed and on many occasions, President Premadasa was ahead of time to open the clock towers to avoid the rahu time.
There were many teams working to successfully carry out this gigantic task of setting up of the 200 garment factory programme.
Many teams from the BOI, UDA, Housing Ministry, CEB, RDA and Telecom were working and included the identifying of investors, areas and land for investment, granting of quota, incentives, infrastructure such as land, electricity, telephones, water, road way etc., setting of target dates for opening of factories, supervision of building construction and reporting progress, assisting in the recruitment of the workers many of whom were from Janasaviya families, arrangements for the opening of the factory and construction of a clock tower in each area.
In addition, the late president also spoke to investors and we had to meet almost daily in the evening at the Sucharitha to review the progress in the presence of investors who had come to sort our problems.
In all these instances they were sorted out on the spot or if the officers were not there, they were given instructions on the phone to attend to matters immediately.
Examples of some of the common matters were the supply of electricity, construction of roadways, provision of telephones which were attended to immediately with the president giving them the date for opening of the factory.
All these showed the excellent managerial skills, commitment and efficiency in which all departments worked to carry out this gigantic task with the outstanding leadership of President Premadasa.
Investors were able to speed up their import and export facilities by the setting up of the separate BOI customs clearing centre.
This mainly assisted the 200 garment factories set up outside the zones and immensely benefited investors by removing many bottlenecks. Therefore, it was really planning, implementing, monitoring and working round the clock that enabled these results to be achieved.
In 1991 the Apparel and Garment exports were app. US $ 764 M. With the setting up of the 200 garment factory programme the exports which gave a boost to the garment exports increased tremendously and have today exceeded US $ 5.0 billion. One of the main advantages of the industry was that since it was the main export earner for Sri Lanka comprising 40% of total exports all governments assisted in the development of the industry.
Even today new factories are opened in the North and East and one of the few avenues available to create employment. Many who criticised the garment industry as a sunset industry can see for themselves the benefit it has given the country. The highest export earner and highest employer of females and meeting tough environmental and working conditions to meet global standards.
Infrastructure projects – The World Trade Centre
It was during the period of President Premadasa that for the first time incentives were given for infrastructure projects. The World Trade Centre (WTC) was one of the significant investments that took place during this time, the exhibition and convention center in Fort, and many other hospitals, housing, TV, radio, mobile phones and hotel projects.
World Trade Centre
This was the first major infrastructure project undertaken by a Singaporean Investor S P Tao that was commenced and approved under the BOI incentive scheme. This was going to be a 39 storey twin tower costing app US $ 130 M and the biggest project undertaken at that time. The ceremonial construction commenced with the presence of S P Tao, myself as Chairman of BOI, Ajith Jayaratne, Cassim directors of Tao’s company and with Ven Podi Hamuduruwo chanting seth pirith.
