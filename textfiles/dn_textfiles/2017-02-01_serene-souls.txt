For serene souls

Dr Nuwan Nayanajit Kumara is an individual with a wealth of acquired and innate wisdom. Writing and singing talents he inherited through his bloodline. Nuwan started writing his first book in 1999 when he was a lad. He learnt martial arts at a young age hoping to become an actor. Yet he otherwise fancied writing a huge book on cinema legend Dr Gamini Fonseka.
On identifying his greatest prowess, he positioned himself as an insightful writer and a scholar prior to maturing in age. He dedicates himself to develop a criticism methodology based on Buddhist philosophy. With this viewpoint he cuts an edge among other critics.
Dr Nayanajit made public his 12th book titled, ‘Othapuwan Nuwana’ aka “Wisdom of the Person who Fears Sin” at the National library and Documentations Services Board on January 20. It was an evening that kindled wisdom of many.
The book has a compilation of movie critiques and articles on artistes appeared in newspapers, magazines written by Dr Nayanajit plus a cross-section of lectures he has delivered over the years on literature and varied subjects.
In his book Dr Nayanajit urges, a critic with an understanding towards Buddhist philosophy could do great justice to his criticism on literary or artistic works including cinema. This methodology that would be unique to Sri Lankans could go global due to its credible nature.
Wilhelm Geiger who translated Mahawamsa into English has used the word, ‘Serene Joy’.
“Works of a critic based on Buddhist philosophy bequeath ‘Serene Joy’ within the critic himself and the reader. Aesthetic detachment from the subject or the work of Art would enable the critic to do justice to his job. Only Buddhist philosophy paves way for this. One can indulge in unbiased criticism this way. Aristotle brought pity and terror to fore in his masterpieces. This gesture somewhat falls in line with Serene Joy”, opines Dr Nayanajit in his book.
Dr Nayanajit stresses in his book, artistes should have a ‘Sin fearing wisdom’.
He says persons guised as critics who aim to tarnish works of Art with ulterior motives ruin themselves as well as sensibility prevailing in a just society.
Any individual has the right to enjoy an Artistic creation; however no one has right to call himself a critic if he doesn’t know his onions. So-called critics who work with the intent of wooing someone or tarnishing someone’s image are societal parasites, he says.
“Any world renowned piece of Art enables to project the creator’s identity as well as the identity of the nation. Leo Tolstoy’s Novels and the Russian society let alone Ingmar Bergman’s cinema and Sweden society are credible examples. Yet core of their works have a universal appeal”.
Dr Nayanajit insists an artiste must identify his best talent and stick to it. (In the subject of marketing, this is called Positioning) Intuition helps an artiste to identify his best area of prowess and one without intuition will let his talents go haywire.
“A critic should have a bird’s eye-view”, He should be able to glide on sky like an eagle balancing his wings and scan his subject well with a telescopic vision” says Dr Nayanajit.
Core attribute of any form of Art is ‘Communication’ thus a journalist automatically becomes an artiste. Journalists can benefit immensely from Buddhist philosophy.
The book launch was graced by prominent personalities in the sphere, Karunaratne Amarasinghe, Dileepa Abeysekera, Mahinda Prasad Massimbula and Dr Nayanajit’s soul mate Ashen Manjula.
Insightful speeches by them made the evening a memorable one.
Dileepa Abeysekera talked on ‘innovative creations’ and said “To indulge in innovation a writer should posses a wealth of knowledge. Dr Nuwan Nayanajit is an innovative creator”.
Echoing Nuwan’s disclosure he said Lord Buddha had made emphasis on the subject of ‘Communication’ thus writers and critics with wisdom could explore the core of Lord Buddhas words. He said the society should not have a wrong perception towards a criticism method based on Buddhist philosophy as a fraction of ‘Jathaka stories’ or something that is opposed to free thinking ideology prevail in the western world.
Othapuwan Nuwana (Wisdom of the Person who Fears Sin) is published by Nugegoda Sarasavi Publishers, a publishing company dedicated to give readers nothing but the best.
