Minister lifts kerosene supply restrictions on fishermen

Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera <U+200B>has resolved the <U+200B>scarcity<U+200B> of kerosene<U+200B> supplied to fishing vessels.
The scarcity occurred due to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation’s (CPC’s) decision to limit <U+200B>the supply of kerosene,<U+200B><U+200B> as<U+200B> certain consumers had recently misused <U+200B>kerosene.
A group of fishermen from <U+200B>the <U+200B>Hambantota district had spoken to the minister regarding the matter and subsequently, the minister had negotiated and come to an agreement with the respective officials to not limit the supply of kerosene to fishermen.
Furthermore, the minister requested the public to inform the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Ministry Secretary if there were any issues of supplying kerosene to fishermen.
