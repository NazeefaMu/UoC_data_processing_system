Cases fixed for written objections for April 25

Five corruption cases filed against Major Nevil Wanniarachchi, the ex-Chief Security Officer (CSO) of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa were yesterday fixed for written objections by Colombo Additional Magistrate Aruni Artigala.
The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed five corruption cases in the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court against Major Nevil Wanniarachchi over non-declaration of assets and liabilities. The Bribery Commission alleged that Major Wanniarachchi had failed to declare his assets and liabilities for a period of five years since 2010 to 2014 while serving as an Army Major.
The Bribery Commission yesterday filed counter objections against the objections raised by the accused party regarding the charge sheets. The cases are to be taken up for written objections for April 25.
The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed charges against the former Minister in the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court under Section 9 of the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law No.1 of 1975.
