Taylor Swift Loves ‘SNL’

Was she angry? Taylor Swift had a surprising reaction to the ‘SNL’ sketch that mocked her and her ‘Bad Blood’ posse, HollywoodLife.com can EXCLUSIVELY reveal. She was totally ‘flattered’ by it!
Taylor Swift, 25, has reacted surprisingly well to being taunted on the Miley Cyrus-hosted SNL episode that aired Oct. 3. She’s “flattered” the show poked fun at her but believes Miley Cyrus, 22, may have had a hand in making the skit happen, HollywoodLife.com has EXCLUSIVELY learned.
“Taylor was flattered by the SNL sketch about her, you know you’ve made it when you’re being parodied by the SNL team,” a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “She thought it was really funny, and has already been joking with her “Bad Blood” gal pals about it, who are equally as amused.”
But despite being able to laugh at herself, Taylor is convinced that nemesis Miley had some hand in the sketch coming to fruition. “Taylor is adamant that Miley must’ve been an influence on the sketch, even though she wasn’t in it,” the source adds.
As we told you, Taylor and her squad were mocked by the comedy show in a Walking Dead-like clip. It’s seems bizarre that a skit about Taylor would appear on the same episode that Miley hosted. Could it be purely coincidental? We don’t know. But one thing’s for sure, we can’t wait to see where their feud goes next. It’s heating up, girls!
Meanwhile, Taylor’s squad has been largely absent during her Canadian leg of her 1989 world tour. Fans who may have expected her pals, including Gigi Hadid, Kendall Jenner and Selena Gomez, may have been disappointed that their favorite stars haven’t appeared lately.
However, rest assured, Taylor has provided her followers with two excellent duets. On her first night in Canada, she performed two Keith Urban hits with the country music star. Then, on Oct. 3, Taylor was joined on stage by Charli XCX for an energetic performance of Charli’s hit “Boom Clap” that wowed the audience.
But back to the SNL sketch, HollywoodLifers. Did you think it was funny? Let us know in the comments below.
