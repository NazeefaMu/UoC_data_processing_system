N-Peace Awards 2016: Recognizing Women in Peace-building

The United Nations Development Programme felicitated Sumika Perera recently at the United Nations Compound for her achievement as one of the 9 winners of the N-Peace Awards for 2016, from over 100 nominations across 7 countries in the Asia-Pacific region.
N-Peace, or Engage for Equality, Access, Community and Empowerment, is a UNDP flagship initiative founded in commemoration of a decade’s implementation of UNSCR 1325 on Women, Peace and Security. Launched in 2011, the N-Peace Awards recognize and profile female and male leaders and peace builders creating change at the grass roots to national levels in Asia. Coordinated by the N-Peace Network across Indonesia, Pakistan, Myanmar, Nepal, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and the Philippines, the Awards shine a light on women and men who demonstrate leadership in building peace and empowering their communities.
To recognize and showcase the achievements of Sumika Perera in the areas of women, peace and security, UNDP hosted a felicitation event recently.
Speaking to the gathering, she stated, “This award is not just for me; it is for all the women out there who inspire other women. Such awards give us strength to continue the good work; to help and strengthen others who have been working in this field, especially at a grass roots level.”
Sumika Perera has been working closely with her community since her early 20s dedicating her life as a community worker. She has led many movements at the grass roots level speaking on behalf of farmers, labourers, and women in her community. She has over 25 years of experience in the field as a community worker and has worked in the women’s movement in Sri Lanka. At present, she works as a coordinator of the Women’s Resource Centre where she works at grass roots level, focusing on human rights issues.
Recognizing the efforts of Sumika Perera, the UN Resident Coordinator and UNDP Resident Representative Una McCauley stated, “Thank you for all the work you have done for women in communities. We at the UN admire and applaud your commitment towards peace building in Sri Lanka.” If you know of someone who is a champion in peace-building in your community, nominate them for the 2017 N-Peace Awards before the 15 May 2017: http://n-peace.net/
