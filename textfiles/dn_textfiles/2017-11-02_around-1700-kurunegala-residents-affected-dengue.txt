Around 1,700 Kurunegala residents affected by dengue

Around 1,700 students, school teachers, infants and residents within the Kurunegala MC area are reported to be taking medical treatment at government hospitals.
Many students of leading schools within the Kurunegala urban area abstain from attending schools these days as they have fallen ill with dengue fever. A grade six female student of a leading school in Kurunegala too died of dengue, recently. Kurunegala MC Commissiner Pradeep Thilakaratne said that cleaning work is now being done within the MC area by utilizing its labour force.
The reason for the spread of mosquito-breeding is that many schools are having construction sites within the school premises, where many pits are found filled with rain water. Dr. Indika Wickramasinghe, who is in charge of the Dengue Control Unit of the Kurunegala Teaching Hospital, said many students and teachers are now undergoing medical treatment for dengue.
