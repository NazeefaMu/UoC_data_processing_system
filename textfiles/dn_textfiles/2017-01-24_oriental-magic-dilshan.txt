The oriental magic of Dilshan

A fighting unbeaten century stand by the buccaneering Tillekeratne Dilshan and the stolid Angelo Mathews was keeping Sri Lanka in the picture on the Third Day of The Test Match between Sri Lanka and Australia. This action took place in Australia a few years back, the place to be exact was Hobart, Tasmania.
Dilshan’s unbeaten hundred thus far has showcased the talent he possesd as a world class batsman, in all three formats of the game.The Aussie pace trio of Siddle, Hilfenhause and Starc was no match for him, Watson and Lyon were also treated by him with equal disdain.
Dilshan squared up to the aggressive pace attack on equal terms, no quarters were given no quarters were asked, chin to chin, toe to toe he faced the abrasive Aussies. The difference between them was that Dilshan possessed the Oriental Magic about him and he was not all brawn but brains as well. Dilshan”s penetration of the cover region, with exquisite wristy stroke play, would have made the late great Sathasivam proud. On this day he was in full element, he was carving out boundaries, square of the wicket, through the covers, past the bowler and off his pads, with wristy power laced with liquid grace. This type of great batsman is born only on the subcontinent in the main. In analysing the performance, of the top three batsmen thus far, on the tour. Sangakkara has been going through a lean patch on the tour.
In comparison among the three, Sanga seemed more intelligent of the trio due to the fact that he was picking the gaps at will through sheer timing and placement. He had ample time to plug the gaps at will. In spite being gifted to the hilt , I found at the time that he was more sensitive to the surroundings at the beginning of his innings, and the abrasive and arrogant Aussies smelled a rat, and had made a note of it to capitalise on it. His poor run so far in the recent past, bears enough testimony to this shortcoming. Perhaps one could deduce that Sangas skin was a shade thinner than what it was in his hay day. At that time a short withdrawal from the scene would have done a world of good to him. The Sri Lankan team was looking for an opportunity to plug in young Chandimal, who was waiting in the wings oozing with talent.
Mahelas decision to quit the captaincy duties after the tour was a good one, and he has been shouldering this burden very well in the recent past, where a packed match schedule was evident, and hats off to him for quitting at the correct time. With this burden off his shoulder, the cricketing world in the future, will witness his true stature as a great batsman.
The captaincy issue then came into focus again, Angelo Mathews was learning the trade fast, and it could have been unfair by the talented youngster to be thrown into the deep end, prematurely. Mathews was becoming a class batting all-rounder by the day, and then we saw a slimmer version of him. To keep him simmering for a while without bringing him to boil would have been the order of the day then.
Provided that Sangakkaras lean patch could end abruptly. I myself feel that Thilan or Sangakkara should have taken up the reins, the former for his fighting qualities in adversities and the latter for being a born leader. Sanga is capable of taking up challenges, we have seen in the past that Sanga can give as good as he gets, I can still remember the master sledging he gave Shaun Pollock when he strode into bat in a match few years back, the language he used was unmentionable although it had a ring of Shakespeare about it.
Shaun Pollock the sportsman that he was acknowledged this banter by Sanga stating “This bloke is certainly good at it”
In a few days, our young guns will battle it out with the South Africans in their home patch, playing in the shortest version of the game initially.
The selectors have brought in a fresh face called Thikshila de Silva this seems to be a bold and a good move, they might have thrown him to the deep end, but if he clicks he would be breaking the ice and that would be a good omen for Sri Lankans flagging spirits.
Same goes to persisting with the other youngsters in the pack, Dhananjaya de Silva and Kusal Mendis, they all should come good hopefully, sooner than later.
