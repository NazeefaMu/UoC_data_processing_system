Seasonal Celebrations light up at Galle Face Hotel

The Galle Face Hotel that has been romanticized as a heritage hotel for many years, and considered South Asia’s leading Grande Dame, is indeed a heritage landmark rooted to both Sri Lanka’s colonial past and its independent present.
Celebrated within the hospitality world, surfacing timeless grandeur, it blends historical splendour with crafted modernity to form a new model for heritage properties. December 4, 2015 was a significant day at the hotel as they lit their seasonal celebrations for the first time with friends from the industry and corporates along with the travel agents and not forgetting the media who have always been supportive in all efforts of Galle Face Hotel.
A live performance by Metho Cantani at the Chequerboard with Santa and the Santarina’s making way to an early start in a horse carriage to amuse the children that so graciously awaited the season’s magical journey. The Galle Face Hotel takes pride in embracing and celebrating its history to deliver to tomorrow’s traveller.
