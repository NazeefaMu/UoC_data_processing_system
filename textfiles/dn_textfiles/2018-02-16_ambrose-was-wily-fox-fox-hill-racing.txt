AMBROSE was a wily fox at Fox Hill Racing

Not so long ago, it was the Grand Prixs, hill climbs and track racing. But now the in thing in this form of sport is Fox Hill and Go kart Racing.
Grand Prixs saw even foreigners wanting to show their expertise and skills in the racing cars they brought along with them. Two names that come to mind are that of the Maharaj of Gondal and Britisher Chris Meek.
Though they could not win, what with Sri Lanka’s champion driver David Pieris on his Arpico Special driving dare devil style leaving the opponents far behind their participation added glamour to the sport.
Pieris suffers flat tyre
I was Sports Editor of the ‘Times Group’ with photographer A.C.M. Zahir and were witnesses among thousands of motor racing fans who watched Pieris complete the Grand Pix race and earn the chequered flag steering the vehicle like a Sterling Moss on a flat tyre to be crowned the champion at the Katunayake air strip in Grand Prix event.
Before going on to describe the motor bike racing champions of that era which was the 1970s and 1980s,whic eras will never come again, I would like to feature an youngster SHANAKA AMBROSE in name who in the1980s burnt the track on his motor bikes winning many events and then taking the Fox Hill racing scene by storm.
AMBROSE came from a family that was crazy of motor bikes. His father Noel was the owner of a motor car and SHANAKA still in his early years would sit on the lap his father who was driving and imagine he was doing the steering. Such was his craze to be behind the wheel and be a champion biker and four wheeler.
Winning events with ease
AMBROSE was a LEGEND on the track. He started his motor racing career in 1984 on a motor cycle and winning events with ease setting up record at Mahagastota, Eliyakade, Radella, Kotmale, St. James and Karandapona races as a champion rider.
AMBROSE who is now domiciled in America with his family was here on a short holiday and it was an experience meeting him and speaking of times when he dominated the racing scene here.
His first comment when I asked him what took him to the top he said that first of all if one is to succeed in the high pressure racing is that one should be fearless.
Car and bike racing is a life threatening sport but if one is fearless and dare take risks success will come automatically.
Treasured moment
His most treasured moment was when he was crowned the SUPER FOX 2000 at the Eighth Caltex Super Cross organized by the Sri Lanka Military Academy in conjunction with the Sri Lanka Association of Racing Drivers and Drivers and sponsored by Caltex. In winning he drove a car called the Caltex Havoline Special.
In winning he recalled the tough resistance he received from drivers of the caliber of Pradeep Jayawardena, Nishan Weerasuriya, Dinesh Deheragoda, Dilantha Malagamuwa and Aravinda Premadasa.
AMBROSE still remembers with nostalgia Rizvy Farook who took a keen interest in his prowess and had given him tyres to compete in the race and his brother Imran, his brilliant mechanic Nandsena and team from Ranga Motors and the evergreen Bri Ponnambalam who himself was a classic driver. He also hadn’t forgotten his sponsors Caltex and all others who helped him in his record breaking career.
Favourite bike
Whenever his uncle Tony visits his home on the motor bike, the BSAs being Tony’s favourite bike, SHANAKA would get astride it and also imagine he was racing.
As he began to come of age SHANAKA showed his craze to one day get on the racing track and show his prowess. That he was talented in this sport there was no doubt when he first got on a motor bike and took part in a novices event. Although not winning, he got the taste for racing and one day told his mother Winifred that he will someday soon rewrite the racing record books which he finally did.
A passion for BSA bikes
Another who could be tagged a LEGEND was Shanaka’s uncle TONY who having tried his urge to race failed and then began to believe it or not collect motor bikes of most makes – he had a passion for a range of BSA bikes which were of British makes of every horsepower – in all 35 bikes which also included Norton Manxs and Tiger Triumphs.
Tony’s passion for bikes began at a very tender age of 7. But he started riding when he was 19. It all started when his uncle Alex who was Workshop Manager of Cargills – then agents for BSA motor bikes would bring brand new bikes like the Empire Star, Standard Silver and Gold Star models.
He bought his first bike a BSA Bantam 125 cc in 1953. However his love was for motor bikes. Tony has owned 4 Morris Minor cars and is still in possession of two, one CN and one EY registration. Tony’s most memorable bikes he owned and still speaks of with awe was the Triumph Tiger Hundred EN 3937 and BSA Shooting Star 4 Sri 4690.
Vintage Car Owners Club
A member of the Vintage Car Owners Club and the Classic Car Club of Ceylon, he is known for his computer-like knowledge of models, registrations numbers, prices, dates and whom he had sold some of his bikes to. In owning 35 bikes and four, four wheelers Tony certainly is a LEGEND in his own style.
