World Elders’ Day celebrated in Beruwala

New state medical faculties will be established at Wayamba, Sabaragamuwa and Moratuwa universities. The existing State Medical Faculty of Ruhuna University will be expanded, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Dr. Senaratne, education will not be privatised. The elderly population is on the increase. More funds need to be invested in the health sector in order to prevent elders from suffering out of various diseases. He was addressing the gathering during the World Elders' Day celebration held at Beruwala recently.
Minister Senaratne said that all should have the right to obtain education without any problem. A child of a person who cut bricks is now studying at SAITM. We need to protect these children. There are problems faced by these people and we need to solve them.
Doctors need to get-together and service the people. Some people admire them and some people blame them. There are good doctors as well as bad doctors. Some doctors are waiting to strike, he added.
