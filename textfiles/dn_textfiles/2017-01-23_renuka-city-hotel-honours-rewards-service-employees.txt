A further 18 employees that have served for over six years received gift vouchers. “We focus our training in-house so our associates learn our culture and the art of hospitality from the very beginning. This method directly correlates to their retention,” said Chairman Ravi Thambiayah.
Renuka City Hotel has been abuzz since its re-launch in 2015 and its Chairman and Directors were keen on hosting this ceremony to mark the service rendered by the team. “Our staff are courteous and detail oriented and respond promptly to our guest needs. Above all they embody the genuine warmth that Sri Lankan hospitality is known for. We felt it was fitting that we give them the recognition they deserve,” said Joint Managing Director, Shibani Thambiayah.
Renuka City Hotel is located in Colombo 3 only minutes away from many of the city’s key attractions and has been a consistently popular and affordable option for tourists and businessmen alike for over four decades. “We attribute this success to the commitment of our staff who ensure that every guest has a pleasant stay. They have gone beyond industry norms to truly personalise the experience of every guest staying at the hotel,” said Joint Managing Director, Arnila Thambiayah.
To ensure this we do a soft refurbishment every four years and a complete renovation every eight years – which includes new plumbing, electrical revamps and so on, so that our customers get the most up-to-date product coupled with the best possible service,” said Executive Director, Niruja Thambiayah.
The hotel’s famous Palmyrah Restaurant is considered an essential stop for locals and foreigners seeking to sample authentic Sri Lankan cuisine in a trendy and comfortable atmosphere.
