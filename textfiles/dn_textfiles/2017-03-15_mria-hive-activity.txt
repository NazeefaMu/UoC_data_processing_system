MRIA, a hive of activity

Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport (MRIA), which was once described as the world’s emptiest airport, has become active again due to the temporary closure of Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) due to the re-laying of its runaway.
Sri Lankan-Indonesian (Sri Vijaya) and Fly Dubai, have been the airlines which have operated most flights to Mattala.
According to officials, 139 flights have landed at the airport during January and February. At least 14 airlines are now using Mattala due to the ongoing repairs at BIA.
During the period, Mattala has recorded 7,704 in-bound passengers and 2,558 out-bound passengers. Fly Dubai flights use Mattala airport every Sunday and Tuesday. It is considered the airline with the highest number of flights.
Authorities are operating a special bus service to transport passengers from Mattala to Katunayake.
