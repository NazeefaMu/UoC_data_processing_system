HNB wins two silvers at CA Sri Lanka Annual Report Awards

HNB PLC continued to receive recognition for its commitment to optimized financial reporting, winning two awards at the recently concluded CA Sri Lanka’s 54th Annual Report Awards.
The HNB team was awarded a silver award in the Banking Institutions category and a further silver award for Corporate Governance Disclosure, as a ceremony held at Shangri La Hotel Colombo.
Commenting on this year’s award HNB Chief Financial Officer, Anusha Gallage said, “As one of Sri Lanka’s most successful banking institutions, HNB remains firmly committed towards driving the highest standards of financial reporting.
“The disclosures made in our annual report are vital to providing all stakeholders with a clear and accurate snapshot of HNB’s performance, and we are once again honored to have been presented with such prestigious accolades at this year’s awards.”
Considered among the most prestigious events in the Sri Lankan business calendar, this year’s awards were held under the patronage of Chief Guest, Central Bank of Sri Lanka Governor, Indrajit Coomaraswamy.
As in previous years, the awards attracted participation from among the very best of Sri Lanka’s corporate sector, with over 130 entities – from blue chips to small non-profit organisations - vying for recognition across every sector of the domestic economy.
The awards themselves are hosted with the aim of promoting transparency, accountability and social responsibility in financial reporting with winners being selected based on their ability to produce cohesive, clear and customized annual reports that best reflect the operational and financial performance of each respective company.
