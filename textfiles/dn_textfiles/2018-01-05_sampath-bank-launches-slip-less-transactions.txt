Sampath Bank launches Slip-less transactions

For the first time in Sri Lanka, Sampath Bank, a pioneer in innovative banking solutions, recently launched Slip-less transactions to provide their customers with even greater convenience by ridding them of cumbersome form filling.
Functioning through a mobile app that is available on iOSand Android, this convenient tool will provide customers with a seamless experience and takes Sampath Bank one step closer towards their goal of paperless banking. With the launch, the Slip-less transaction facility will allow customers to carry out cash deposits and withdrawals without filling out any forms. The Bank plans to roll out bill payments, credit card payments, cheque deposit facilities and much more in the near future in order to reduce the use of paper and provide customers with more convenient ways to bank.
“This is yet another first from Sampath Bank thus continuing our trend of starting the year with a digital innovation. At the start of 2017 we introduced 10 digital products and in 2018 we introduce Slip-less transactions. Our single-minded focus on our customers has allowed us to create greater convenience in their lives and provide them with a safe, fast and paperless transaction method.
This latest innovation takes us closer to our ultimate goal of paperless banking. We are excited with this launch of the Slip-less transaction facility and look forward to bringing more innovations,” said Nanda Fernando, the Managing Director of Sampath Bank. Registering for Slip-less transactions is simple and only requires customers to download the app, enter their name, NIC number, mobile number and create a password within the app. The customer will also have the option of inputting their account number and email address during the registration process for added convenience.
Commenting on this innovative launch, Dinusha Ihalananda, Deputy General Manager – Operations,said, “Innovation has always been the cornerstone of our banking philosophy. We have always tried to change the way people bank and think about banking. And now with Slip-less transactions we are once again changing the banking landscape.
