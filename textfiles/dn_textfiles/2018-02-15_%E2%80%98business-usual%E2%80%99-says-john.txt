‘Business as usual’, says John

Politicos on both sides of the divide were shuttling from one meeting to another yesterday as a decision on the political stability and future of the country hung in the balance with various factions trying to diffuse tensions.
A special Cabinet meeting was held under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday morning. However, the Daily News reliably learns that the meeting had ended inconclusively.
The Cabinet meeting was followed by further talks amongst SLFP and UNP members’ last afternoon.
Minister Susil Premajayantha said that President Maithripala Sirisena would make a special statement before Friday.
Speaking to Daily News, Minister John Amaratunga who was present at yesterday’s Cabinet meeting said that it was ‘business as usual.’
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe also chaired a meeting yesterday at Temple Trees.
A 10-member Committee with equal a number of members from both the SLFP and UNP set up to make recommendations and reform proposals is due to submit its report tomorrow morning on the future trajectory of the coalition government.
“There were no questions raised or discussed with regards to the future of this government. It almost seemed as if there is nothing wrong with the current predicament,” Minister Amaratunga said. He however added that many were awaiting the recommendation from the Committee which is to be submitted on Friday.
The uncertainty and instability was acutely reflected yesterday when the Sri Lankan Rupee depreciated to the highest level ever. The rupee had depreciated to Rs.155.80 to Rs.156 yesterday afternoon against the dollar.
Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake yesterday confirmed that the two parties failed to reach a consensus over the future of National Unity Government. Commenting on what transpired at the Cabinet meeting and the UNP meeting which followed up, he said different views were expressed by the ministers over the continuation of coalition Government.
Explaining the UNP stand point on the current political deadlock, Minister Dissanayake said,“People who don’t want to work with PM Ranil Wickremesinghe can go and we will continue the Government with whoever remains within the coalition.
“Ministers like Dilan Perera have no right to dictate terms to our leader. If he wishes he can leave the Government,” Minister Dissanayake said.
