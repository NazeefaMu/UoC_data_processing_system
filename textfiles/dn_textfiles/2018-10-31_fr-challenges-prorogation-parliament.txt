FR challenges prorogation of Parliament

A fundamental rights petition was yesterday filed in the Supreme Court seeking an order to quash the gazette notification issued by President Maithripala Sirisena to prorogue Parliament until November 16.
This petition was filed by public Interest litigation activist and lawyer Nagananda Kodituwakku naming former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and Attorney General as respondents.
The petitioner maintained that the respondents including former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe are responsible for creating uncertainty in the country by violating the people’s sovereignty.
