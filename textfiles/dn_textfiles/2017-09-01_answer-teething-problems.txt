Answer to teething problems

Next Monday Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and President Maithripala Sirisena will jointly unveil a Three Year plan of Development of the consensus Government. Up to now the Government has been drifting like a ship without a rudder. Hence, this is a positive step. However, an assessment of the plan could be made only after it becomes public. We hope the Government would heed public opinion and adjust the plan, if necessary instead of vetoing people’s representations offhand.
Sri Lanka’s experience in planning has been not so smooth. In 1956 a National Planning Council was established for the first time. It produced a 10 Year Plan in 1959. However, it was almost forgotten after few years or it became irrelevant due to various problems that arose. Then in 1965 the Government set up a new Ministry of Planning and Economic Affairs which engaged itself not in the formulation of a national plan but a series of plans for various ministries. It was followed by a five-year plan 1972 -76. Again in 1975 a Two Year Plan was put forward followed by a new Five Year Plan 1978 - 83. None of these plans were implemented completely.
Too much emphasis was given for interests of power politics in the formulation of plans or insufficient attention was given to scientific and technical requirements.
Development and environmental issues
One of the basic shortcomings was the lack of a holistic vision of development, plans being at best a collection of several separate sectional constituents without much co-ordination. A plan should not only embrace all segments of the economy but also have an integrated structure that coordinates those segments into a unity. Moreover, economics cannot be separated from politics. Hence what is needed is a political economy approach to development.
This involves the participation of all stakeholders in the process of planning and more so in its implementation. This participation is vital for successful implementation of plans. Any major development is bound to face environmental issues as well as re-location of human settlements, manpower problems besides those of a purely economic nature as investment capital, technology and material infrastructure facilities.
No development would be meaningful if it does not guarantee equity to affected population, especially to marginalized sections. Hence, investment should be sufficiently productive so that the wealth newly created could offset the expenditure on the project including its foreign contribution or foreign debt. In this respect city beautification projects as well as the Hambantota Port and Mattala Airport project did not bring any benefits to the population in the short-term pushing the country to a colossal debt trap. They did, however, benefit a few crony capitalists who amassed personal wealth at the expense of the people.
The Uma Oya development project is a classic example of an ill-coordinated project initiated bureaucratically without popular consultation and proper environmental assessment. It displays not only bad coordination but also bad management. It should be remembered that the biggest beneficiary or the biggest loser in any development project is the public and not the government or the investors or creditor.
Holistic approach to planning
Let us show by few examples the results of lack of a holistic approach to planning. We have been experiencing a shortage of labour of all grades- skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled- for a considerable time. The problem has become so acute that it has become necessary to import labour while there is a considerable efflux of our own labour to the Middle East and elsewhere. Development plans do not include provision for labour force reinforcement. Low salaries and wages in many trades discourage youth to join them.
Though we speak of introducing modern technology and machinery to agriculture so as to attract youth, hard nnounced its intention to form cooperative farming enterprises nothing has happened so far.
Nor has sufficient attention been given to water management even in the face of a severe drought. Rain water harvesting and urban garden cultivation are projects that could be done with community participation. Both could be used to alleviate the high cost of living besides improving agriculture- especially vegetable and fruit growing.
The disjointed nature of planning becomes more apparent when one considers the mismatch between education and economic planning. Often students are blamed for selecting social science courses instead of Science, Engineering or Medicine. Few only know that only a minority of schools in the country has facilities for science education at Advanced Level. Thus correction should begin much earlier in the Secondary education classes.
Unemployment of graduates
On the other hand, University academic courses are ossified for a long time. They have to be constantly upgraded and opportunities should be there for studying multi-disciplinary subjects. Another reason for the unemployment of graduates is the stagnation of the economy. Specialized employment opportunities will be created when the economy gets revived. Development plans should also include the development of adequate human capital. Till recently technical and vocational education was almost neglected. It should receive at least the same attention as academic higher education.
Efficient management of services such as transport is a sine qua non for rapid development. This has been a neglected sphere in which ad hoc decisions have made the situation worse. The Railway is under-utilized as a means of transport of goods. No use of waterways as a mode of transport has been despite a history of such use. Long term planning of the road network is lacking which causes a need for perennial widening of roads and highways inconveniencing the public. Public transport is much neglected, the only reform being the permission granted to run private passenger transport services.
Most important factor of development is raising productivity of material and human capital. It calls for constant upgrading of the technical basis of machinery, improvement of the soil, developed methods of production and raising the productivity off labour et al. This is very important since we have to produce for the international market which is competitive by nature. Without higher productivity export orientation of the economy will not produce results.
