Army continuing work at Meethotamulla to prevent future catastrophe

Sri Lanka Engineer (SLE) troops of the Army still at work in Meethotamulla to prevent any future recurrence of a catastrophe or a garbage-slide in the area.
They have now begun to erect a solid soil-bund bordering the remaining heap of garbage. They are draining away underneath polluted water, laying huge drainpipes (hume pipes) as a durable drainage system, and continuing to measure emission of methane gas.
The work was supported by the recently-raised Army Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Response Squadron, Sri Lanka Land Reclamation & Development Corporation (SLLR & DC) and other technical experts.
The troops work under the guidance of Army Chief Field Engineer Major General Dananjith Karunaratne on the directions of the Commander of the Army, Lieutenant General Crisanthe De Silva.
After the troops completed covering mounds of garbage with polythene to resist rainwater since it could aggravate any water-based chemical reactions inside the heap, Army Engineer troops succeeded in unearthing a huge and long underground drain that remained buried totally under piles of rubble. It was subsequently cleared and restored to drain away polluted water using submersible motor pumps, thereby reducing water levels that would develop to be a mini-flood after cautious troops dug the location and laid more than 150 drainpipes as a long term initiative.
The ongoing construction of a soil-bund surrounding the garbage dump by Engineer troops was also another alternative to ensure that no any eventual garbage-slide would occur again or further expand perimeters, exposing resident civilians to more risks.
The CBRN Response Squadron, which saw its birth recently as a conceptual notion of the Commander of the Army to meet with any catastrophic chemical emergencies or challenges, has been continuously monitoring methane levels, arising naturally out from the garbage heap as another precautionary measure on the directions of the Chief Field Engineer of the Army. Lieutenant General Crisanthe De Silva. A special Sunday (30) afternoon meeting presided by the Army Chief Field Engineer at the location fully reviewed all preventive and precautionary measures that have so far been put into effect by Army Engineers and servicemen since the Day 1 of the disaster.
The Chief Field Engineer during this gathering spelt out the remaining workload and other follow-up phases, needed to be effected without any further delay.
The meeting was attended by several foreign officials, Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau officials, Disaster Management Centre officials, Sri Lanka Land Reclamation & Development Corporation officials, Brigadier Amith Seneviratne, Engineer Brigade Commander and Major Sanjeewa Assaddumegedara, Commanding Officer, and 5 Field Engineer Regiment.
