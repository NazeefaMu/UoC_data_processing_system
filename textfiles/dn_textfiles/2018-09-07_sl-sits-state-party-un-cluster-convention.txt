SL sits as State Party to UN Cluster Convention

For the first time Sri Lanka was seated as the State Party to the Convention on Cluster Munition (CCM) at its eighth Meeting of States Parties (8MSP), at the United Nations in Geneva, on September 3.
Sri Lanka became a State Party to the CCM on March 1 and becomes the 103rd State Party to the Convention.
Sri Lankan Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the United Nations in Geneva, A.L. Abdul Azeez delivering a statement on the opening day of the 8MSP, said that Sri Lanka never used cluster munitions during its nearly three-decade long armed conflict between the government security forces and the LTTE. Sri Lanka becoming a State Party to the CCM shows its commitment and support towards international humanitarian disarmament causes and eradication of such inhuman weapons. Sri Lanka’s accession to the CCM requires that the country will not use, produce, transfer and stockpile cluster munitions. The CCM came into force in Sri Lanka on September 1.
The 8MSP enthusiastically supported Sri Lanka’s candidacy for Presidency of the ninth MSP next year and Sri Lanka’s Ambassador Azeez was designated as its President on September 5. This will be a historical occasion not only for Sri Lanka, but also for the South Asian region. Sri Lanka will be the first President of the CCM in the region.
The Sri Lankan government was also represented at this meeting by Major General H.R.K.P. Peris of the Sri Lanka Army, Deputy Permanent Representative Samantha Jayasuriya, and Minister Counsellor of the Permanent Mission of Sri Lanka to the United Nations in Geneva, Shashika Somaratne. The Cluster Munitions Coalition was represented by Sri Lanka Campaign to Ban Landmines (SLCBL) and Forum on Disarmament and Development Coordinator Vidya Abhayagunawardena and SLCBL Campaigner and Sri Lanka Campaign to Stop Killer Robots Coordinator Yanitra Kumaraguru.
