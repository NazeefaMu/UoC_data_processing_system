Get breathing space from that annoying office mate!

Whether you are an extrovert who will do anything for attention or the quietest introvert ever, attention does have its price. And unwanted attention comes with a very steep price, since it is usually more of a pain than flattery. Now, I’m not talking about celebrities who spend their entire lives stabbing people in the back to be on the cover of ‘People Magazine’, only to hide behind sunglasses once they get there. What I’m talking about is us regular folk who have to deal with unwanted attention at some point in our lives.
Which brings us to the annoying co-workers who are about as common as annoying meetings. No matter where you work, there is always going to be someone who could very well be the most annoying person that ever existed. And unfortunately, there is always one person that this annoying co-worker latches onto.
This person will spend too much time at your cubicle or office. They will always ask you to lunch (although you’ll never ask them). They’ll call and email you pictures or funny articles that aren’t funny and have nothing to do with work. If you are the one who attracts such an annoying co-worker, then I’m very sorry for you. But have no fear because there is light at the end of the tunnel. Only just don’t turn around because chances are that annoying co-worker followed you into that tunnel.
Because this is your workplace, you have to be careful about how you deal with a co-worker who gives you unwanted attention. You can’t be as stern as you may be with someone in your personal life. Since you see this person every day and honestly, may even end up working directly with or even for them at some point, you don’t want to burn any bridges. So straight-shooting and telling this person flat out to leave you alone is not an option.
Yes, there is one in every office, the loud talker, the cubicle invader or the perpetual procrastinator. Annoying co-workers can be an encumbrance, particularly when they interfere with your productivity.
There is the guy who points a finger at you in a gun motion and orders you to "smile," or the woman who stops by to chat about her six cats for 45 minutes. There's ‘Giggles’ two cubicles away who thinks everything is funny and you can't escape overhearing how hysterical it is. Or ‘Baby Talk’ who is constantly cooing to his girlfriend.
There are even more difficult colleagues particularly those whose personalities get in the way of your work. They are constantly on the defensive, scheming or rude. They include the aggressive types the passive-aggressive types, the whiners and the know-alls.
But annoying people can become toxic to your workday. Those small predicaments tend to build up, and can turn reasonable people into human land mines. Honest solutions to little problems can keep you from going off the deep end.
Before you erupt in rage over a co-worker’s annoying habits, consider these tips to improve the situation without getting written up by human resources or even worse, losing your job. One of the most common complaints from workers who spend their days toiling away in cubicles or open areas is lingering co-workers who drop by without an invitation.
They may be friendly enough, but not only do they invade your work space, they also tend to monopolise your time with endless banter.
Everyone can benefit from a knowledgeable co-worker, but the one that seems to have done it all or knows everything about anything can be downright infuriating. While it may be satisfying to tell that co-worker to shove it, that could land you in hot water with your employer.
The know-all has an opinion on everything and loves to tell you how to do your job better. The solution is to let it roll right off your back.
The more you ignore this person and don’t let him or her get to you, the better. When they offer an unsolicited opinion, say: “Thanks, I'll think about that.” And if you find yourself getting frustrated, comfort yourself with the knowledge that this person is widely considered obnoxious. You definitely are not the only one being irritated.
When the co-worker offers unsolicited advice thank the offender and say you’ll consider it.
Then there is the loud talker. Despite sitting on the other side of the floor, you may know intimate details about a co-worker's life thanks to his or her lack of volume control.
Loud talkers are distracting, but in many cases they aren’t aware of how loud they are speaking. Or they could be suffering from a hearing difficulty.
Another variant on the loud talker is the co-worker who simply talks too much. A simple question can lead to a 20-minute conversation about non-work issues, setting you back in your work.
You have to be assertive in this situation and not let the person have so much power over how you spend your time. Tell the co-worker that you are on deadline.
If that fails simply say you need to stop talking and get back to work.
The blabbermouth goes on and on and on. He or she is especially talented at roping you into long conversations that never end when you are on deadline or trying to make a phone call.
In fact, with most types of annoying co-workers, the solution is simply to be straightforward and assertive. Not angry, not hostile, just direct.
But that is something that can make people anxious, so it is important to know that it's really okay to speak up for yourself in a matter-of-fact, professional way.
And if that fails, just be glad these people aren’t in your family.
At the end of the day, dealing with an annoying co-worker is part of office life and something that needs to be handled tactfully so as not to hurt someone’s feelings. After all, you may be committing some of the mentioned offences and not even know it. [email protected]
