ADB releases  ‘Banking on the  Future of Asia  and the Pacific’

Banking on the Future of Asia and the Pacific: 50 years of the Asian Development Bank, a history book of ADB was released today at ADB’s 50th Annual Meeting of the Board of Governors in Yokohama.
It details ADB’s activities from its origin in 1966, decade by decade to the present day. It also illustrates the genesis of ADB regarding different proposals from across Asia and the Pacific, preparatory meetings in Bangkok, Manila and other cities, and collaboration of people within and outside the region to discuss the Charter, membership, and location of the Headquarters.
The book is authored by Peter McCawley, an academic from the Australian National University, a former Executive Director of ADB and former Dean of the ADB Institute.
He was supported by the intensive work of a team of ADB staff, and benefited from comments and inputs of numerous people, including former ADB personnel.
The book aims to review how ADB over 50 years has responded to Asia’s challenges given its unique regional perspective. It provides an objective and comprehensive account of ADB’s 50 years through three historical narratives, Asia’s economic development, the evolution of the international development agenda, and the story of ADB itself.
ADB President Takehiko Nakao said that “the unique character of this book is to discuss Asia’s economic history, from the perspective of development and based on the rich experience of ADB’s interaction with countries.”
The book is the first detailed corporate history of ADB in 30 years, the last was published in 1987 to commemorate the 20th anniversary.
