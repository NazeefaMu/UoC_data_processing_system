Milky morning meal

Are you bored by breakfast? Research indicates that people who eat a higher protein breakfast feel less hungry during the day.
Based on a growing body of science, many nutrition experts now recommend people get 25 to 30 grams of protein at every meal especially at breakfast. The average adult generally doesn’t have trouble meeting that protein benchmark at lunch and dinner. But take a look at breakfast — there are ways to add more protein to a morning meal. Nutritionists recommend spacing out our protein more evenly throughout the day, which makes it more beneficial for maintaining and building muscle. It’s also important for keeping us full so we don’t feel hungry soon after we eat.
You may think you’re getting enough protein with two eggs on your breakfast plate, but you likely need more. Adding an extra glass of milk, with high-quality protein, on the side is an easy, delicious way to get closer to all the energy you need for the day.
