Help Saudis implement Vision 2030, Lanka envoy tells compatriots

In an Independence Day message to the Sri Lankan community in the Eastern Province, Ambassador Azmi Thassim urged community members to cooperate with Saudi authorities to implement Vision 2030 and the National Transformation Program (NTP) 2020.
He was speaking at the country’s 69th Independence Day celebrations organised by the Sri Lanka Cultural Forum in Dammam on Friday.
Thassim hoisted the national flag amid the beat of drums, then community members joined the choir to recite the national anthem.
The Kingdom hosts the largest population of Sri Lankan overseas workers, which numbers 1.5 million.
A large number of expatriates from all walks of life were present at the morning function.
Patriotic songs were sung, and dances to depict Sri Lankan culture were performed to entertain the audience. Typical Sri Lankan dishes were served to guests. Thassim urged his countrymen to contribute to the progress and development of the Kingdom, and to build a better Sri Lanka.
