Students nabbed after holding dawn liquor party inside school premises

Eight students who had consumed liquor at the Mihintale Maha Vidyalaya premises as part of a birthday party held in the school were admitted to the Mihintale hospital yesterday morning for further investigation and a report. These students in the Grade 11 class had arrived in the school around 6.30 am before the other school children, bringing a bottle of liquor and ‘bites’and held the party inside a neglected teachers’ quarters in the school premises without the knowledge of school authorities. Another group of students who had observed this group consuming liquor had reported the matter to a group of teachers. However before the teachers came there the intoxicated students had fled the scene. However, the teachers had managed to collar the students and informed the Mihintale Police about the incident.
As some of the students were highly inebriated, the whole group were admitted to the Mihintale Hospital to check their level of intoxication. Hospital sources said the students were later handed over to their parents. School sources said the Principal and the tutorial staff had been highly inconvenienced and become crestfallen over this students misbehaviour.
