Lanka Hospitals continues to win awards for excellence

The internationally accredited, multi award-winning Lanka Hospitals Corporation PLC, continues to excel as an organization by winning yet another series of awards, this time for Annual Reporting.
The hospital won an award for the “Ten Best Integrated Reports” for its excellence in integrated reporting at the “CMA Excellence in Integrated Annual Reporting Awards” held recently.
The event was organized by The Institute of Certified Management Accountants of Sri Lanka, which is the pioneering body for management accountancy in Sri Lanka.
The event seeks to promote integrated reporting among Sri Lankan companies. The reports were evaluated by using guidelines applicable in the international framework issued in December 2013, taking into consideration not only the accounting and financial information but also non-financial information.
Dr. Prasad Medawatte, Group CEO, The Lanka Hospitals Corporation, PLC said, “Here at Lanka Hospitals, we are continuously striving to excel in everything that we do. Winning this award is important to us because as an ethical organization that provides service from the heart, we want to ensure that our information and accounting is reported in a fair, accurate manner that is transparent to all our stakeholders.”
As a testament to the continued excellence throughout its organizational operations, Lanka Hospitals also won the prestigious “Asia's Best Employer Brand Award” for its HR Practices, in a glittering ceremony which was recently held in Singapore. The dynamic healthcare brand also clinched the “2017 Best Employer Brand Award,” also in recognition for its effective HR practices. Furthermore, the marketing team at Lanka Hospitals won the “Golden Globe Tigers 2017” award for excellence & leadership in healthcare management for its “Best Use of Social Media and Digital Marketing in Healthcare.”
Both of these events were organized by “Employer Branding Institute” of India.
