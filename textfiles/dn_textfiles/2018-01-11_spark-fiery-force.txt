Star Wars: The Last Jedi
From spark TO FIERY FORCE

Progressing at a swift-pace, Star Wars: The Last Jedi establishes an action-packed movie teeming with twists and turns, with a new and unique tone.
With their position compromised, the Resistance flees from the clutches of the First Order, but their sparks of hope fade as they are caught in a deadlock. To escape their impending doom, Finn and a maintenance worker of the Resistance named Rose Tico set out on a secret mission, which takes them to the city of Canto Bight on the planet of Cantonica. Meanwhile, Rey meets Luke Skywalker on Ahch-To, requesting his aid against the First Order, as well as to help her master the Force.
Refreshing change
The Last Jedi delivers a gripping storyline supported by excellent and unexpected plot twists throughout the movie—a refreshing change to theStar Wars franchise. The plot’s progression perfectly builds the tension for upcoming scenes, whilst keeping the audience at the edge of their seats; and the movie also builds anticipation for particular outcomes, only to shatter all expectations.
The combination of the dialogues, music, and the performances of the actors and actresses successfully present not only dark and dramatic scenes, but also emotional and humorous ones as well. Director/Writer Rian Johnson has done a brilliant job in setting up these varying atmospheres and in delving into the deep-seated dissonance within characters. We now not only see a conflicted villain, but a conflicted hero as well.

Where Star Wars: The Force Awakens only scratched the surface of Kylo Ren’s inner conflict and ambitions, The Last Jedi takes us to its roots, shedding some light on his past. This establishes a better connection between viewers and him. Adam Driver’s portrayal of Ren is fantastic as his character struggles to come to terms with his doubts and fears—to break free from the shackles that hold him down and become what he is meant to be.
Akin to Ren, Luke Skywalker is also seen battling his inner demons. He is not the Luke he once was. Where once stood an optimistic hero willing to come to the aid of any who were wronged—without a second thought—now lies an apathetic, grief-stricken shell. Mark Hamill’s performance is indeed very powerful on this new take on his character. Every word, every facial expression compelling conveys the pain, guilt, and despair that has struck him down and led him into isolation, as penitence for his past mistake.
Sense of morality
Daisy Ridley continues to do a spectacular job as her character, Rey, attempts to understand the powers and abilities that have awoken within her. Coming from nowhere and not knowing anything about her origins, Rey is on a journey to find her place amidst all the chaos that has unfolded before her. Her empathy and strong sense of morality, along with her unyielding will, are captivating and shine throughout the movie.
The chemistry between Ridley and Hamill is quite strong, as Luke helps Rey to reach her true potential and Rey attempts to understand the reasons behind Luke’s reluctance to rejoin the fight. Their relationship, though rough in the beginning, loses its friction as they both acknowledge their sides of the story—a journey well-balanced with poetry, drama, and amusement, all leading to a shocking revelation.
Poe Dameron, Finn, and Rose get their fair share of the spotlight and bring in much humour to the movie. The movie gives Poe a captivating space battle sequence, in which his headstrong attitude gets him into trouble. Finn and Rose’s quest sets a more lighthearted tone to the story, but it also makes the movie lose its pace. But aside from cheering up the crowd, Finn and Rose are also challenged—the story tests the lengths they’d go to in order to protect the ones they care for and stand up for what is right, regardless of the cost. Oscar Isaac (Poe), David Boyega (Finn), and Kelly Marie Tran (Rose) meet all these aspects that their respective characters face with great precision.
Although it does lose momentum while switching between certain sequences, The Last Jedi gradually builds up more and more suspense until the very end. The close-combat sequences were quite intense, and the new weapon variations introduced were an exciting spectacle to behold.
Considering the cinematography, aside from the wide shots perfectly capturing the lightsaber duels, other noteworthy shots were the aerial and establishing shots involving the island Luke has chosen exile on, and the close-up shots involving the main characters—particularly the ones that highlight their expressions of anguish. While integrating aspects of the original series with his own additions, Johnson also dabbles in unexplored characteristics of the Force itself; and similar to a line mentioned in The Last Jedi, the movie itself kicks off with a spark that soon ignites a fiery force.
In the end, uniting features both old and new, Star Wars: The Last Jedi brings forth a new and breathtaking experience for fans.
