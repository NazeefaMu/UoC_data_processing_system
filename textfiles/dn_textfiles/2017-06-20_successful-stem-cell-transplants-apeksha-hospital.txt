Successful stem cell transplants at Apeksha hospital

The stem cell transplants have already cured nine cancer patients treated at the Apeksha Hospital, Maharagama, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Minister Senaratne said that no Leukaemia patient should die today because modern medical treatment is available at the Maharagama cancer hospital now. Bone marrow transplant surgeries have commenced at the hospital for the benefit of cancer patients. One such surgery costs around four million rupees in the private sector.
He was addressing the gathering during the world Blood Donation Day celebrations held at the BMICH in Colombo recently.Senaratne pointed out that the Health Ministry established 19 blood transfusion centres countrywide at a cost of 22 million Euro.
Now Sri Lanka exports blood plasma to foreign countries in order to produce drugs. Soon, an American company will commence producing drugs in Sri Lanka using blood plasma. Human Placenta will also be used to transplant cells.
Unlike in the past, Sri Lanka does not destroy blood donated by donors. The blood donated by donors is kept for ten years. All data of the blood donors will be computerised soon, he added.
