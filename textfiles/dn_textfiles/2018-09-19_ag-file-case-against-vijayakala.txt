SPEAKER tells HOUSE
AG TO FILE  CASE AGAINST  VIJAYAKALA

The Attorney General will file a case against MP Vijayakala Maheswaran for the controversial speech made by her in Jaffna last August.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya told Parliament that he will take appropriate action regarding MP Maheswaran following the court decision.
“Until the court gives the decision, I cannot take any action,” Jayasuriya said.
The Speaker made these observations following a query by Joint Opposition MP Wimal Weerawansa.
Weerawansa demanded from Jayasuriya to inform the House if or not MP Maheswaran’s speech was in violation of the Constitution. In reply, the Speaker said that he will take necessary action when a court rulingis given with regard to the case.
