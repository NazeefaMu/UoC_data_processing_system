Navy opens RO plants in  kidney disease prone areas

The Sri Lanka Navy, which has been implementing a wide array of community service projects, opened three more Installation of Reverse Osmosis (RO) plants in areas where high prevalence of kidney disease is recorded.
The three RO plants were opened at Kusum Pokuna Pushparama Viharaya in Medirigiriya, Bodhirukkaramaya in Diyasenpura and Abhayawardhanaramaya in Abhayapuragama on Saturday by Justice and Buddasasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe.
Speaking on the occasion the minister commended the efforts of the Sri Lanka Navy and its initiative to open RO plants in areas where there is a high prevalence of the Kidney disease.The RO plant facility installed at Kusum Pokuna Pushparama Viharaya is capable of producing safe drinking water for 400 families in the area and 10 Buddhist monks at the temple.
The system at Bodhirukkaramaya can facilitate 420 families and eight monks in the temple with safe drinking water. Over 350 families in the area and six monks of Abhayawardhanaramaya too could get safe drinking water as a result of the latest installation of an RO plant at the temple premises.
The financial contribution for these RO systems was made by the Ministry whereas the compartments the systems are installed were constructed by the Navy’s Research and Development Unit.
The Sri Lanka Navy’s Research and Development Unit has been extremely influential in producing these RO systems utilising their expertise and technological know-how and has successfully installed a total of 140 RO facilities across the country to date, facilitating over 61,139 families and 47,445 schoolchildren with safe drinking water provided free of charge. The Navy will continue to set up more RO plants in kidney diseases prone areas in due course.
