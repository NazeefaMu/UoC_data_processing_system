Beware, he's active again!

The emergence of a new party within the SLFP has become the talking point of most, today. Although the parties of the United Opposition indicated their interest of a party lead by Mahinda, SLFP members were mostly silent. Leaders gave strong statements against dividing the party. President Maithripala Sirisena has said, sometimes people ask him whether he will not allow dividing the SLFP. He pointed out that if someone is attempting to divide the party and form a Front that is a treacherous act against the SLFP.
He said this in a meeting organized under the patronage of Nuwara Eliya SLFP Organizer C. B. Ratnayake. Speaking on the occasion the President said that he worked as the General Secretary of the SLFP for a long period of time and he would never attempt to divide the party. He further said that everyone should join to protect the party from those who try to divide the party, to gain narrow political mileage. On the other hand, at the same time, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa denied that the United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA) is divided and said that the reason he did not form his own party to contest the election is because he was not ready to abandon the SLFP for his personal gain.

When asked as to why he decided to contest the parliamentary polls and whether the UPFA is divided due to his decision, the ex-President responded saying: "I have come forward at the request of the majority of my party and the UPFA and most importantly the people of this country." "UPFA is not divided at all," he assured. While Maithri, talked about the unity of the SLFP; Mahinda emphasized on the unity of the UPFA.
New political party
Strangely enough the UPFA members such as VASU, Wimal who were categorized as left or socialist party leaders in the past, now have become the most violent patriots undermining the interest of the minority nationalities. Instead they have become the perpetrators of fascistic campaigns of Mahinda clan. Apparently the SLFP MPs supporting former President Mahinda Rajapaksa have been asked to refrain from talking about forming a new political party to contest the forthcoming Local Government election. However other members of the UPFA who supports Mahinda come out with statements in support of forming a party or front that includes them. This has been followed by the SLFP members too.
"We have realized that SLFP MPs issuing statements to media about forming a new political party will hinder our negotiations with the SLFP to work out a settlement. Therefore, the SLFP MPs representing the joint opposition were asked to keep mum on the matter. At the same time, there will be negotiations with the SLFP and the 'joint opposition' to arrive at a final agreement. Those discussions are aimed at preventing a split in the SLFP," a top-notch member of the 'joint opposition', formed by UPFA dissidents has stated. So this is conspiracy to undermine the leadership of Maithri and to draw the bulk of SLFP to the party created by the UPFA.
However, they have agreed that the other party leaders of the UPFA can talk about forming a new political party because they don't have any commitment to the present SLFP leadership.
Maithri supporters
The SLFP MPs supporting the former President will only talk about the new political party if Maithri refuses to accept their demands. The conspirators say that even the former President would not openly talk about forming a new political party, at this point. While this conspiracy is going ahead, speaking at a press conference held recently SLFP stalwart Minister S.B. Dissanayake said the party leadership would not be 'transferred' to the former President, at any cost. "If the former President leads the election, we will certainly face another defeat. But, I accept that our campaign needs his blessings," the Minister explained.
Many militants are deeply worried about what is happening. While Maithri supporters still believe to win elections by hiding behind the image of Mahinda and maintaining an artificial unity within the SLFP fascistic elements is busy undermining the leadership of Maithri. Today the problem within the SLFP has become the disturbing problem of the government. Many drums started to beet! Forming a new party is unavoidable, says former minister Basil.
