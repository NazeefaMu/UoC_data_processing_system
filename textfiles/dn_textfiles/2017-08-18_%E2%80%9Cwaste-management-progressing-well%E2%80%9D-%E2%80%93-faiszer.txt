According to information received by the National Task Force Unit established by the Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government, the process of disposing and collection of garbage is progressing well compared to the past few months.

From August 1st up to now, there is a reduction in the number of incidents reported which is less than 50.

Public inconvenience due to the garbage crisis is under control. As we could implement short term and long term solutions for this issue, we soon could lessen the issue, under the guidance of the President and Prime Minister. The next step is to implement long term solutions. I declare with responsibility that we will end this garbage crisis as soon as possible, and another government will not have to experience this issue.”
