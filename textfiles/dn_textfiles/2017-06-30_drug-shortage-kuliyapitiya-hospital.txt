Drug shortage at Kuliyapitiya hospital

OPD patients seeking treatment for diabetes at Kuliyapitiya District Government Hospital in Kurunegala are inconvenienced as medicine is unavailable there. They are compelled to seek support from outside to get medicine due to the shortage of drugs, a retired school principal of Kuliyapitiya J. M. Sarath Bandara said.
