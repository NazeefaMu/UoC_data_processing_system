Surplus.lk construction portal launched

Surplus.lk, a B2B or B2C construction portal, is designed to simplify the way buyers and sellers with excess supply connect more quickly, dispose their stock and turn their surplus stock into immediate profit,’’ said Riyad Ismail, Chairman of Surplus Web Portal, at a event held earlier yesterday at the official launch and press conference of the Surplus.lk site.
The official launch was done by the Board of Surplus.lk; Anasuya Gunasena, General Manager - Marketing demonstrated the site’s features and buying and selling options at the event.
The site was officially unveiled to the general public at the Construct Exhibition 2017 and generated much interest.
Surplus.lk provides an ideal solution for individuals and corporates to transact and benefit from selling, buying or renting construction and industrial inventory and services in one unified website, where they can display any product to interested clients for an unlimited time. Surplus.lk also includes a rating system where the buyer can rate the sellers or service providers based on the quality of the item and the service received.
The sole aim of Surplus.lk is to provide interested sellers or buyers an opportunity to eliminate their surplus inventory and similarly offer potential buyers the opportunity of sourcing of surplus items and services for a fraction of the original cost. The site would also act as a perfect platform to encourage business opportunities between sellers and buyers.
The site offers a vast range of building materials and building products such as bricks, welding rods, ready mix and even excavators and forklifts are listed on the site.
The site thus covers the entire breadth of the engineering sector; the platform offers categories such as services and resources, building material, building products, industrial, tools and equipment for rental or permanent use.
