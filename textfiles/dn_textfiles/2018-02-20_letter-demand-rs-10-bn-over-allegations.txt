Grandpass building collapse
Letter of demand for Rs. 10 bn over allegations

Dr. Ali Asger Shabbir Gulamhusein has sent a letter of demand to Farida Shabbir for Rs. 10 billion over allegations that the latter provided false evidence to the police and coroner on the Grandpass building collapse which occurred on February 16.
Dr. Gulamhusein, writing through his attorney President’s Counsel Kalinga N. Indatissa, has stated that the claim made by Shabir that the building collapse was carefully planned by Dr. Gulamhusein in order to kill their uncle Taher Gulamhusein was false and malicious in intent.
He has strongly denied any connection to the building collapse and explained that Shabir made these statements with the ulterior motive to gain advantage with regard to pending litigation between him and Shabir.
Dr. Gulamhusein maintained that the collapse of the wall was an accident and he was not in the vicinity when it happened.
He further noted that the false accusation was also a result of the two parties being engaged in litigation over the estate of Shabir Abbas Gulamhusein. Farida Shabir had stated that the Last Will of Shabir Abbas Gulamhusein was forged and from the time of the institution of the aforesaid action, he alleged that Farida Shabir has made false affidavits and stated different versions at different times.
Her husband, Ali-Asger Tyebkhan too has lodged a false complaint against him, he stated and alleged that Farida Shabir and her husband have been party to the suppression of documents before the Courts of Justice.
The letter of demand also stated that in the past, they have put continuous pressure on Dr. Gulamhusein and his family to forego his legitimate rights under the Will.
The letter asks that Farida Shabir pay the Rs. 10 billion within a week or face legal action.
