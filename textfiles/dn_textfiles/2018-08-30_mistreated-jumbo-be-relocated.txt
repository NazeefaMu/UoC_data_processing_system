Mistreated jumbo to be relocated

‘Kalana,’ the elephant of the Vishnu Devale in Devinuwara will be handed over to the Dehiwala Zoo or the elephant orphanage at Pinnawala following complaints of abuse, Wildlife officials said.
Wildlife Minister Sarath Fonseka earlier said elephants being kept in temples and devales will be sent to zoological gardens if they are mistreated.
Two persons, arrested for allegedly neglecting the elephant ‘Kalana’, were released on a Rs. 100,000 surety bail each, when produced before the Matara Magistrate on Tuesday.
Kalana’s mahout and the Secretary to the Devinuwara Vishnu Devalaya Basnayake Nilame were arrested on Tuesday for allegedly neglecting the elephant.
‘Kalana’ had been chained at the same place in the Devinuwara Vishnu Devalaya for about three years. As a result, its legs had been injured and infected. The arrests were made following a Police complaint lodged by Wildlife Deputy Minister Palitha Thewarapperuma and Wildlife Department officials on Monday.
The Deputy Minister intervened after environmentalists and social media activists brought the matter to his attention.
The veterinarians of the National Zoological Gardens Department have started treating the elephant. They inspected the elephant on Saturday.
The elephant was gifted to the Devalaya in 1989 by former President the late Ranasinghe Premadasa. The next date of the court case was fixed for September 9.
