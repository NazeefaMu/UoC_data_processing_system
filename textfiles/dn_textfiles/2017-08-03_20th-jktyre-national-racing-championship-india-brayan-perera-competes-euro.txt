20th Jktyre National Racing Championship in India: Brayan Perera competes in Euro JK 17 category

Brayan Perera will be participating in the 2nd round of the 20th Jktyre National Racing Championship in India this weekend. He will be driving in the famous Euro JK 17 category.
This is the first time in Sri Lankan history that India has invited a Sri Lankan to take part in this elite racing category, consisting of the top drivers in India and around the world.
The cars that are driven in this category reach up to speeds of 260 kmph. Formula 1 Drivers such as Sebastian Vettel, Carlos Sainz and Daniel Kyvat have all driven these very same cars under the Red Bull BMW junior program.
Brayan Perera said, “It is a great honor to represent my country in this prestigious event and hope to make my country proud”. This is not the first time he has been invited to race in India. On many of his previous visits he has made an impact on the Indian Arena.
As he was the first Formula Junior champion in 2016 and was the only rookie in 2016 to get a podium in the Formula LGB category. This achievement has propelled him forward and has become a driver to watch. Brayan Perera can arguably be said to be one of the top young drivers in Sri Lanka as he was the youngest Formula EFI champion in Sri Lanka and has continued to be a consistent podium winner.
