Word’s worth

A few yards off the ramparts of Galle Fort, the pedestrians had no clue as to what was happening inside the colonial building. They were not interested anyway. If you took a leisurely stroll into the Galle Fort, you would have noticed quite a beehive of activities: volunteers guarding the entrance for the events covered by festival and day passes, another group of enthusiasts heading to the pre-booked events while the rest attending the free events scattered around the premises. Not interested in any event? You could still roam the terrain and chill out sipping a free cup of tea while shelling out a few rupees to the refreshment available ubiquitously.
Such is how the Fairway Galle Literary Festival 2017 took off last week.
Following heavy criticisms and controversies and a subsequent lapse of a few years, the festival withstood an otherwise-retirement-possible. And now the festival seems to sail smooth. It is all in motion with no discontinuation in sight.
Anjan Sundaram was a participant whose question and answer session dragged on beyond the usual period of 15 minutes. His documentary Deciphering India: the Great Indian Male was an unorthodox retelling of India’s male dominance. Titled as Lunchtime Illumination, the series hosted short films free of charge. Sundaram’s work cannot be called a short film. His was a comprehensive documentary on how an average Indian female had willingly or unwillingly been facing the male suppression. Determination of sex, Sundaram proves with evidence, is part and parcel of Indian culture. The birth of a female child is left for the male community to decide. Even the abortion is allowed when the newborn happens to be a female.
Apart from Sundaram’s documentary, the Lunchtime Illuminations series documented the postwar upbringing in Sri Lanka. Except for a film or two, the rest of the films feasted on the conflict of interests between the main ethnic groups in this country. For instance, most filmmakers focused on how the Sinhalese, as the majority nation of this country, ill-treats the minorities.
The festival moved on with a number of excursions, duets between literati, workshops aimed at budding writers, literary dinners/luncheons, thinking out loud sessions where bestseller authors would voice their experiences and some more.
David Macdonald and Dawn Burnham elaborated their passion of dealing with the wild cats. The audience was made privy to the very much private world of the leopards, lions and other wild cats. The co-existence among them, surprisingly, is lethal. Even if a lion could speak, the humans would not understand the animal, Macdonald quoted Wittgenstein in order to explain the complex behaviour pattern of the animal famous for fierceness. He went on to enlighten the audience with the sad story of the diminishing lions in Africa and other subcontinents.
Professor Peter Frankopan, whose session of changing history along the Silk Road, had a packed audience. No attendee could leave the audience until the session is over. The Oxford-educated professor enlightened the audience on realigning our understanding of the world, pointing towards the east. He was extraordinarily deft in the way he explained about his subject to a non-specialist readership.
The literary luncheons and dinners were held outside the usual premises. That provided the participants with the opportunity to explore deep aspects of literature and allied areas with bestseller authors such as Colm Toibin. Then there were sessions allocated to private affairs too! That too opened the doors to a private and leisure chat with the authors while enjoying the mocktail (that consists local delicacies such as king coconut and papaya juice).
When the New York Times tagged John Gimlette as someone who writes with enormous wit, indignation and a heightened sense of the absurd, they were not in the wrong. His talk on his celebrated nonfiction titled as The Elephant Complex was full of wit. The longer you stay in Sri Lanka, the more you will know the country. But - Gimlette paused before adding - you will understand the country less. His graphic presentation provided insights into what he has been observing in Sri Lanka. Gimlette has handpicked the strangest aspects of the commonest events that we experience on an almost daily basis. It is a detailed biography of Sri Lanka’s elephants as well as the allied subjects.
The Sinhala Day was held free of charge, albeit without much enthusiasm. Piyal Kariyawasam, an award-winning author, who also happened to be a moderator at the festival was not quite happy with his session.
“The audience had no single question to ask during the Question and Answer session. I find it pathetic as a moderator,” Kariyawasam observed.
Ashok Ferrey, on the contrary, had to practise immense concentration dealing with the Question and Answer sessions. They are huge writers, Ferrey commented, and they needed to be dealt with only following proper research. The attendees have already purchased the books of the panellists to execute a constructive dialogue. The bookstall was crowded almost every time.
The Galle Literary Festival is yet to reach Sri Lanka’s common masses. The festival has evolved a considerable journey with a considerable progress probably owing to the heavy criticism and ire it attracted during the initial stages when the Festival Founder Geoffrey Dobbs was completely in charge of it. The festival is been a utopian experiment among the English-speaking crowd in a land where the majority is not conversant in the same language. Whether it will reach the common audience one day, only time can predict.
Anna Lotfulina, a Russian software engineer, who attended the festival with her husband and one-year-old son, was quite happy about the festival.
“We can, of course, read some of those things on the Internet. But nothing like meeting your favourite author in person. When you get to interact with them, you can read their body language too in addition to the books they have authored,” Lotfulina commented.
Most works of fiction as well as nonfiction, discussed at the festival, contain at least one reference to Sri Lanka. Anita Nair, for instance, has made reference to Galle in her maiden novel Idris: the Keeper of the Light published in 2014. The Indian author, however, has never been to the city until her participation at the GLF in 2017. The volunteers had a busy schedule throughout the festival, as the sessions were held at different sites at the same time. The Fotocube, the official partner in photography was an omnipresent tribe occupied in an amazing job of covering every detail of the festival.
The festival had something resourceful to offer to avid readers as well as would-be prolific writers. Grown with the love of words, the festival has a long path to roam to prove the written word’s real worth.
