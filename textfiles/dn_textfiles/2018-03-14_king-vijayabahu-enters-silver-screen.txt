King Vijayabahu enters silver screen

W A Silva’s celebrated novel ‘Vijayaba Kollaya’ will be converted into a cinematic edition by Buddhi Keerthisena and Professor Sunil Ariyaratne to celebrate the 71st anniversary of Sri Lankan cinema. Vijayaba Kollaya is the last film script by the late Dr Tissa Abeysekara. Professor Sunil Ariyaratne’s cinematic attempt is the latest attempt to the series of films based on W A Silva’s novels such as Kele Handa, Deiyanne Rate, Daiwayogaya and Handapana.
Vijayaba Kollaya is the most successful historical novel authored by Silva, according to Professor Ariyaratne, Vijayaba Kollaya in 1521, is a historic event, where the three sons of Vijayabahu VII of Kotte, King of Kotte mutinied against their father killing him and divided the Kingdom among themselves. King Vijayabahu VII had three sons by his first marriage named Bhuvanekabahu (later Bhuvanekabãhu VII of Kotte), Pararajasingha (later Raigam Bandara) and Mayadunne (later Mayadunne of Sitawaka). Queen Kiravella, whom the king married second, had a son named Deva Rajasinghe by her first marriage.
The princes who came to know that the king intended to make Devaraja the heir to the throne, at the request of his second queen, became hostile to the king. The king was murdered in the palace itself by a hired foreigner. This event is known as the Wijayaba Kollaya.
The muhurath of the film was held recently at the residence of Buddhi Keerthisena, the executive producer of the film with the participation of the film’s cast and crew.
