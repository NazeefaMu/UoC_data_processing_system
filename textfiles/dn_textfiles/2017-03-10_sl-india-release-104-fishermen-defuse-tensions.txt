SL, India to release 104  fishermen to defuse tensions

Sri Lanka and India yesterday agreed to release the fishermen held in each other’s custody after a high-level discussion between the two sides here following the killing of an Indian fisherman, a top government source said.
Sri Lanka would release 85 Indian fishermen, the source said, adding that India would free at least 19 Lankan fishermen; “This move is being made to defuse the current tensions,” the source added.
It was a reference to the current controversy where the Sri Lankan Navy has been accused of opening fire on Indian fishermen and killing one of them.
The Sri Lankan Navy, however, denied the allegation, saying it does not open fire at poaching fishermen and only arrests them. - PTI
