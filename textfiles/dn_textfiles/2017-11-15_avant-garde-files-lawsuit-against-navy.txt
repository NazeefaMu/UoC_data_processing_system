Avant Garde files lawsuit against Navy

Avant Garde Maritime Services (Pvt.) Limited has filed a lawsuit in the Colombo District Court claiming Rs. 2.4 billion as damages from the Navy Commander and the Attorney General for seizing a floating armoury vessel at the Galle harbour in 2015. Avant Garde Maritime Services filed this lawsuit challenging the Sri Lanka Navy's decision to seize M/V Mahanuwara, a floating armoury vessel of Avant Garde which was found docked at the Galle Harbour on November 13, 2015.
The plaintiff alleged that the action purportedly taken by the defendants caused a colossal loss to the plaintiff company. The petition had been filed through Counsel Sanath Wijewardena.
