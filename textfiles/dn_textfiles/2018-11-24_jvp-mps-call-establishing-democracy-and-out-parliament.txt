JVP MPs call for establishing democracy in and out of Parliament

A group of JVP MPs pointed out that their struggle is for establishing democracy in and out of Parliament and demanded President Maithripala Sirisena to take the necessary action to restore the balance in the country, considering the majority shown by 122 MPs of the UNP, JVP and the TNA in Parliament, for the third time yesterday.
The JVP MPs holding a press briefing in Parliament yesterday emphasised that they shall not vote in favour of Ranil Wickremesinghe at any given circumstance. We have never voted in favour of him and we will continue to follow the same stance in the future, the JVP MPs observed.
“It is the President’s responsibility to appoint a new Prime Minister and a Cabinet now that the UPFA has failed once again to show a majority in House.
The JVP is an independent party that will neither enslave itself to the UNP nor to the UPFA.
We also would like to deny the allegation made by Dinesh Gunawardena who says that the Speaker has violated the Constitution and the Standing Orders when conducting the proceedings of the House. The JVP made sure that everything happens in line with the Constitution and the Standing Orders,” JVP MP Vijitha Herath pointed out.
Commenting on the recent statement by S.B.Dissanayake requesting President Sirisena to withdraw the Gazette dissolving Parliament, Herath said that S.B.Dissanayake has now panicked that they will lose if they go for a general election.
“There are, I think, only seven MPs left in the SLFP. This is why Dissanayake is asking for a Provincial Council election. They are the people who supported the President in these reckless decisions. Now they are trying to protect him from the repercussions,” Herath also said.
Meanwhile, JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti said that whoever shows a 113 votes in Parliament now shall not represent the mandate of the people. Thus, it is important that a free and fair general election be held,” Handunnetti pointed out.
JVP MP Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa urged the people and religious leaders to stand against the purported government. He also observed that any decision taken by the purported government would stand invalid and legal action must be taken against such a decision in due course.
