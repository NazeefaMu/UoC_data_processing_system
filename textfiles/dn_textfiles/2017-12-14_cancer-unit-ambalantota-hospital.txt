Cancer unit for Ambalantota hospital

A special cancer treatment unit will be opened at the Ambalantota hospital today to provide indoor treatment to cancer patients, Director of the Hambantota General Hospital Dr. Danushka Perera said.
The new unit at the Ambalantota hospital would fill the void created by the absence of indoor cancer wards at the Hambantota hospital, he said.
All these years, cancer patients in the Hambantota region had travel a long distance to Galle to obtain treatment from the Karapitiya hospital while patients in the Uva Province had to proceed to the Badulla General Hospital for treatment.
Although cancer clinics had been conducted at the Hambantota hospital since 2014, those needing indoor treatment had to be sent to Karapitiya or Badulla Hospitals for necessary expert attention.
The new indoor unit at the Ambalantota hospital has a bed capacity to facilitate 20 patients at a time, said oncologist Dr. Mahilal Wijekoon.
He said a pharmacy for cancer patients would be opened at the unit within a month.
