Things that stink

It is commendable to see the Government finally getting down to collecting source separated garbage under four categories (biodegradable, non-biodegradable, glass and paper). However, it is important not only that initiatives are made, but that they are also sustained. For sustainability to take place, it is important to receive the cooperation of all stakeholders including consumers’ service providers, policymakers, legislators and most importantly the law enforcement authorities. Law enforcement authorities are so very important because many people lack discipline in this country and have the, “Someone else will clean up after me, so why bother” attitude.
There was a time, not so long ago, in Sri Lanka when the Environmental Police and local authority personnel (Public Health Inspectors), worked together and imposed massive fines on those who threw garbage on streets. This resulted in a drastic reduction in garbage thrown on streets; but unfortunately the practice of imposing fines was discontinued, and the environmental police now seem to be absolutely inactive. Dumping of garbage on the streets should attract high fines (like those proposed for traffic offences), and no one would object to it. Such action would close the door on those who refuse to cooperate, thereby perfectly complementing the source separation program and making it more of a success. Source separation is so crucial for making final disposal more efficient, mainly in terms of increasing the lifespan of final disposal sites, as well as the conservation of resources, through recycling.
More action needed
Its high time the authorities took some serious action to stop people dumping garbage on streets, which not only discourages those who provide their cooperation to solve the problem, but also pollutes neighbourhoods and public places and make them uninhabitable.
The Dehiwala beach is a good example of this, where rubbish thrown by residents living by the canals finally end up on the beach. Areas adjacent to the railway tracks in Dehiwala have also become garbage dumping sites for various types of garbage including construction waste. If not for its uncleanliness and polluted seawater (mainly due to the sewer water coming through the canals, which could be mitigated if serious efforts are made), the area between Dehiwala bridge and Mt. Lavinia Hotel has great potential for tourism. Even in its current state, some of restaurant on the Dehiwala beach depict a glimpse of paradise. Stretches of beaches close to cities in some countries are considered gold mines for tourism. Although creating awareness aimed at preventing people from throwing garbage on streets, polluting waterways etc. is useful, many people in Sri Lanka require more persuasive means to change their behaviour. In light of the Government’s plan to develop a Megapolis, these matters will need to be looked at in a more serious manner.
Ideally, garbage disposal should be as smooth as in most developed countries where the rules are clear, and both consumers and service providers respect/observe them.
However, taking into consideration the ground level realities in Sri Lanka, this ideal stage could only be achieved gradually by setting practical and realistic targets (as against complex and unrealistic targets towards which people are reluctant to offer their cooperation), which once achieved, would make people realize the clear benefits of their actions, and motivate them towards increased cooperation.
On the contrary, unrealistic targets like separation of garbage into more than 2-4 segments, or banning lunch sheets may be too burdensome for most people, and may dampen efforts even before you can get started. Not necessarily slowly, but steadily is the way forward. If roads and public places are clean, drains do not get blocked when it rains, and when everyone realizes that everyone else is contributing their little part, they will be willingly to cooperate towards the sustainability of the system.
Current issues
Mentioned below are some of the key issues currently faced by people with regard to garbage disposal:
Garbage collectors demanding money (on a daily basis in some areas). This encourages people not to hand over garbage to garbage collectors but to dump them on roads. Poorer neighbourhoods are given step-motherly treatment due to their inability to respond to monitory demands made by garbage collectors. So many of them resort to dumping garbage on streets.
Secondly the garbage collection system does not follow any standard pattern of collection (regular days and time of collection) that is convenient and consistent. So whenever the garbage collectors fail to appear on the days they are supposed to, people are forced to dump their garbage on roads (especially in neighbourhoods where residents have small houses and no garden space).
In addition, there is no system that stops other people from throwing garbage in front of your property or in public areas.
There is also no system of garbage disposal for people who go to work and have no one to hand over the garbage to the garbage collectors.
Moreover, people dumping garbage in drains resulting in such trash collecting in front of other people’s houses or blocking drains, resulting in flooding. Some people burn garbage in drains thinking that it is justifiable to use drains as incinerators.
There is also no proper system to handle disposal of construction waste (especially small volumes). Although local authorities provide a service that addresses this issue, in most cases, they are riddled with corruption, and customers are asked to be on a lengthy waiting list.
We also have no place to hand over electronic waste (computers electrical appliances etc.).
A possible way forward
Given these problems, there are certain suggestions I would like to mention to solving some of the above mentioned problems:
Introduce laws that make the house owners responsible for keeping the front of their homes clean, (including drains by introducing individual drain separator mesh), and severely punish those who put garbage in front of other people’s homes or public places. Providing households with CCTV cameras on demand, in order to prove the conduct of lawbreakers or accepting photographs/videos as evidence. Lawbreakers, if found guilty, should be fined severely (e.g. Rs 25,000 minimum fine). It is only then that people would take serious their responsibility in keeping the environment clean. Households who are unable to keep the front of their homes clean should be provided a paid service that could be offered even by the private sector.
Fully activate the environmental police and have a hot line for complaints that ensure the anonymity of the persons making the complaint. Each complaint should have a reference number for follow up purposes. Mobile (bicycle) patrols should be sent out to identify and bring to the book those littering roads, public places etc.
In addition, an on call paid service that is void of corruption should be provided for the disposal of construction material, and items too large to be included in the daily garbage collection (e.g. tree trunks, large branches, old foam mattresses, broken furniture etc.). This should ideally be done by the private sector, with a maximum response time of 48 hours.
We also need a collection system for other waste (e.g. electronic waste, CFL bulbs, batteries etc.) should be introduced. Probably specially delegated places like supermarkets could serve as collection points.
The government should also have an immediate ban on Styrofoam lunch boxes should be implemented due its detrimental effects on the environment. In order to encourage the reuse of polythene bags, supermarkets /shops could be requested to charge Rs 5 for new polythene bags, and ban the free provision of shopping bags.
Clean used polythene bags could be collected at supermarkets and could be reused at the request of customers free of charge. The services of the environmental police could be obtained in order to ensure that supermarkets and shops implement this policy. Another system is for supermarkets to sell reusable (strong) bags and completely stop the provision of free polythene bags, so as to encourage consumers to bring their own bags.
Compost bins should be provided to pre-schools and schools. Utilizing the compost, students should be taught practical aspects of home gardening during the class periods for environmental education. Some pre-schools have a pot for each student and they are taught to put soil and seeds in it, and water the plant.
What they learn through this is for life. In the face of global climate change and threats to food security, home gardening should be encouraged at every level. Even a 1-5% increase in food production through it is a great achievement.
The below mentioned 7 R principals should be compulsorily taught (in an absolutely practical sense) in all schools. It could also be popularized in institutions (similar to how 5s principles have been made popularized).
Reject: Reject products, services, techniques, methods which cause significant environmental damage and that you can do without (e.g. plastic, polythene)
Reduce: Reduce your energy, water and resource usage
Reuse: Reuse what you have used, to reduce impact
Reclaim: If you cannot reuse 100% use whatever part that can be reclaimed.
Replace: Replace products, services, methods with more environmentally friendly alternatives. (For instance, replace polythene bags with bio degradable bags, replace plastic files with cardboard files, and replace vehicular transport with bicycles, walking or vehicle-pooling)
Repair: Repair broken items without purchasing new items
Recycle: Recycle products which cannot be reused as a whole
Finally in order to educate people of the initiatives, have 20 second TV advertisements to establish correct and incorrect behaviour, and warning people of the serious consequences they will face if laws are violated. Private companies could sponsor these ads as a part of their CSR programmes.
