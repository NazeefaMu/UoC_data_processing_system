Hotline to assist mothers in labour

A hotline – 3636 – will be launched today to save the lives of labouring mothers in critical condition with various complications and their infants. The hotline is open 24 hours for all Junior Consultants (doctors) and doctors from peripheral hospitals, Consultant Community Physician and the President of the Perinatal Society of Sri Lanka (PSSL) Dr. Kapila Jayaratne said.
According to Dr. Jayaratne, the hotline is a voice operating system that directs doctors to obtain relevant services. The hotline offers expert medical advice from expert consultants for junior consultants and doctors of peripheral hospitals to handle complicated deliveries and infants with various complications. The doctors can ask what to do for labouring mothers and their infants in critical conditions. In addition, the hotline offers to take over the patient; ask doctors to transfer the patient to offer the required care at a better hospital.
Dr. Jayaratne said doctors who use Mobitel connections can simply dial 3636 and if they use other connections, they can dial 0710363636.
This service is available countrywide including in Colombo.
Therefore, any doctor handling a delivering mother in a critical condition can obtain either advice or opportunity to transfer (shift) the patient to a hospital where expertise care is available.
The service will save many lives of mothers and infants. It will cut down the maternal death rate of the country, he added.
