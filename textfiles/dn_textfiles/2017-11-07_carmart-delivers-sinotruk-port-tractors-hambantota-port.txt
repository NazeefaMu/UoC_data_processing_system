Carmart delivers SINOTRUK port tractors to Hambantota Port

Carmart (Pvt) Ltd has successfully delivered new SINOTRUK port tractors to the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA). Marking the first time that these vehicles have been used by the SLPA, these trucks will now join the heavy machine fleet at the port to aid in its rapidly expanding operations.
Financing and procurement for this contract were facilitated by China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd as part of the Hambantota Port Development Project (Phase 2).
China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd is an engineering contractor and a subsidiary of China Communications Construction Company (CCCC).
SINOTRUK had been attempting to break into the port market in Sri Lanka for several years, but had been unsuccessful until recently partnering with Carmart, which has had extensive experience with supplying port equipment through a former group company, Fairfield Trading Company Ltd., the then distributor for Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (forklifts), Kato Cranes, Mafi and Capacity RoRo tractors and other material handling equipment. Leveraging its past experience, Carmart was able to open the door for SINOTRUK’s debut into Sri Lankan port operations.
SINOTRUK is currently China’s largest export manufacturer of heavy vehicles.
Carmart is the authorised importer, repairer and spare parts distributor for Peugeot and Mazda. Carmart has now expanded its product offering by solidifying its ties with SINOTRUK Group and is well on its way to positioning itself among industry giants.
“This is a historic moment, marking the debut of the SINOTRUK brand to the public sector in Sri Lanka. We are certain the brand has a bright future in Sri Lanka”, said Yasendra Amerasinghe, Director/CEO of Carmart.
