CIM Sri Lanka’s inaugural Teachers Forum envisions education in New Age

The Chartered Institute of Marketing (CIM) Sri Lanka held its first Teacher’s Forum titled ‘The New Age Education’ with the objective of highlighting the challenges associated with school education.
Participating at this thought-provoking event was a large gathering of teachers from the country’s leading national, international and private schools.
The forum comprised an exciting roster of experts and leaders in education who helped stimulate vibrant discussions.
Drawing from her experience internationally as well as her wide ranging understanding of the local education system, Nicola Walsh, Inspector to the Government of the United Kingdom spoke on the importance of providing effective feedback.
She said, “Positive feedback - as in what you do, say and write influences the performance of the children. Research shows positive feedback has high impact with minimal cost.”
She encouraged teachers to devote time for students to talk – collaborative working – setting work to match ability which helps children feel challenged.
Dr. Udena Attygalle, Consultant Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist, addressed the gathering on 'The common mental health issues in children and adolescents and how it impacts education'.
Dr. Attygalle said,“A child is a developing being, learning in several domains such as cognitive, physical and academic. Mental health issues are simply a label but what is needed is to understand the child.”
“When working with children we need to be non-judgmental especially working with mental health issues. Most mental health issues manifest as behavioural problems in children and we need to understand what is going on in their world.”
The next speaker, Hasini Gunasekera, Course Director, International Academy of Beauticians (Pvt) Ltd., discussed areas on the importance of image building and personality development.
She said, “Appearance is a communication tool which tells others about your profession, professionalism, level of sophistication and credibility.”
Instructing on ‘How image can add value to your life’ she said, “You need to take certain initiatives to project yourself in the same form you would like others to perceive you. So just like a personal brand is built - how others see you and how you see yourself.”
Reiterating the role of CIM Sri Lanka, Onalie Dissanayake, CIM SL Educational Services Manager said, “As an educational institute we would be delighted to assist the teachers and principals to improve our future generation through career guidance, motivational sessions, etc. Our professional members with wide range of experiences are willing to support to improve and develop the students of our country. We conduct these programmes free of charge to schools on their request.”
