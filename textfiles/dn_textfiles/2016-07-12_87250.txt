2nd u19  ODI at NCCFernando sets up series  leveler with 97

 
An excellent innings of 97 from skipper Avishka Fernando supported by sharp fielding and tight bowling saw Sri Lanka beat South Africa by 12 runs in the second under 19 ODI under the Duckworth Lewis rain rule to draw level one-all in the three-match series at the NCC grounds yesterday.
Sri Lanka defended their moderate total of 209 by reducing South Africa to 184-8 off 47.4 overs when rain ended the match. At that stage under the D/L method South Africa were 12 runs short of their target score.

Sri Lanka innings was held together by Fernando who hit 11 fours and two sixes in his 115-ball innings. No other batsmen made more than 26 as South Africa pinned down the Lankan batsmen with a mixture of pace and spin. South Africa lost three cheap wickets for 27 runs in their run chase and was always trailing behind. Two run outs at crucial stages of the innings didn’t help their cause. With the exception of captain Wian Mulder (41) and Kenan Smith (46 n.o.) the rest of the batsmen struggled to find runs on a slow surface.
The run out of Jesse Christensen in the 35th over proved to be a vital loss for South Africa.
The third and final under 19 ODI will be played at the SSC on July 13.
