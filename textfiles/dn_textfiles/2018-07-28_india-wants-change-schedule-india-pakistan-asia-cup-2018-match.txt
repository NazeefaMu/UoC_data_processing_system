India wants change of schedule for  India-Pakistan Asia Cup 2018 match

When the Asia Cup 2018 fixtures were announced, there was a genuine buzz in the air as soon as Indian cricket fans found out about the India-Pakistan game on September 19.
The rivalry between India and Pakistan remains a feisty one, but political tensions between the two countries over the years means clashes between the two sides have been restricted to ICC events only. However, a report in CricketNext indicates that the BCCI is unhappy about having to play against a qualifier just one day before the derby against neighbours Pakistan.
“The scheduling is mindless. There appears to be zero application of mind,” a senior BCCI official said according to the CricketNext report.
“How can you accept a scenario where India plays a game today and tomorrow it will face its arch-rival Pakistan who will have a two-day period of rest?”
“This is unacceptable and has to be revisited. Maybe for the organisers it is just a money-spinning game but for us it is important that there be equity in scheduling,” the unnamed official added.
Pakistan will also play a match against a qualifier on September 16, but they will get a two-day break to rest and recuperate for the match against India.
By contrast, India will play against a qualifier on September 18 then take to the field the very next day for what is sure to be a much tougher match and with much higher stakes against Pakistan.
