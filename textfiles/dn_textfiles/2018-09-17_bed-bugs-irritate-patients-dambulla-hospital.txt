Bed bugs irritate patients at Dambulla Hospital

Bed bugs are infesting the wards as well as the doctors and nurses’ quarters at the Dambulla Weera Denzil Kobbekaduwa Base Hospital.
Hospital employees said that no action has been taken to eradicate the problem. In the previous year, the entire hospital was cleaned by the provincial health department. However, the problem had resurfaced.
The district health services office said that during the previous year, the management had taken prompt action. The same facilities are available to the hospital this year too.
The matter would be probed, a senior officer of the district health office said.
