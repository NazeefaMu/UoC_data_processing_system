17th Golden Pennant Football encounter in Matara
Spectator intervention prevents a result

Spectator intervention prevented a result being reached in the 17th Golden Pennant Football Encounter between Rahula College and St. Thomas’ College Matara. Rahula were in the lead with two goals to one at the time. The annual football encounter was hosted by St Thomas College and played at the German Sri Lanka friendship football ground at Uyanwatta recently.
Spectators intervened when the referees disallowed the would have been equalizer by St Thomas College as a player was ruled offside at the crucial moment. With approximately 12minutes of the game remaining the officials were unable to continue due to the controversy. Referee Indunil Ediriwickremasuriya said that a result could not be given as approximately twelve more minutes of play remained and confirmed that Rahula led two goals to one when the interruption occurred.
As the barrier erected by the organizers was less than a meter away from the line the spectators encroached the space inbetween and even spilled on to the playing field in places as the game progressed hampering the line judges from carrying out their duties. The attempts made by the organizers and the police officials on duty to keep the lines clear were not futile.
Vice captain Vinuka Sameshana (21) opened the score for Rahula in the 27th minute of the game while Reshan Brian Weerapulli scored the second goal for Rahula eight minutes later to see Rahula lead two goals to nil at half time. STC skipper Dilshan Tharaka made it two nil through a penalty 29 minutes in to the second half. The Thomians would have equalized six minutes later if a player was not ruled offside when Tharusha Biyanka managed to get a free kick past goalie Pramuditha Madihahewa.
With a result not being reached in this game the series stands level with eight wins each.
