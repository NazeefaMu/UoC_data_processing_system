Deepika  opts out of 'XXX4'

Deepika Padukone made her big Hollywood debut opposite Vin Diesel in last year’s ‘xXx 3: The Return Of Xander Cage’. But ever since, there have been murmurs that the production team is all set to get Deepika to reprise her role as Serena in the next installment of the action franchise.
Although DJ Caruso had confirmed about Miss Padukone’s inclusion in ‘xXx 4’, it’s not happening anymore.
“Deepika has refused the offer. She was keen on doing it but she is unhappy with the way her Hollywood career is shaping up. Priyanka, despite a smaller role in ‘Baywatch’, has made a bigger impact on outside shores. She has turned down the role.”
But the real reason happens to be something else.
Our source reveals, “Deepika’s dates for ‘xXx 4’ were needed around October end - December. She couldn’t do the film because she’s kept her dates free around that time as she’s tying the knot with Ranveer Singh. Unless there are last minute changes in dates of the marriage, she won’t be seen in ‘xXx 4’ for sure.”
