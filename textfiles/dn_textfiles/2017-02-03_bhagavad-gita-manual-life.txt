Bhagavad Gita, manual for life

Living is an art, skill and technique that needs to be learnt and practised. The Bhagavad Gita enunciates the ancient philosophy of Vedanta and presents the eternal principles of life and living which transcend race or religion.
The principles equip one with a strong intellect to meet the challenges of the world and achieve success and peace in all aspects of one’s life – official, social and domestic. Above all it ushers one towards ultimate perfection, the goal of spiritual enlightenment.
Chapter XVIII of the Gita defines sannyasa renunciation and tyaga relinquishment. A detailed analysis of the causes, incentives and constituents of action follows. The different aspects of action are further classified into the three gunas, qualities of sattva, rajas and tamas. It helps one to assess one’s personality and determine spiritual development.
The study of Bhagavad Gita helps to purify one’s personality and attain the ultimate goal of Enlightenment, a state of total fulfilment. Bhagavad Gita is systematically taught at the Vedanta Academy, Pune, India. The Academy was founded by Swami Parthasarathy, a world renowned Vedanta philosopher and management resource.
