Moves to revive Kotmale MPCS

Steps will be taken to revive the Kotmale Multi-Purpose Co-operative Society (MPCS), Kotmale Divisional Secretary I. M. Senanayake said at a meeting of the Kotmale Development Co-ordinating committee at the Kotmale Divisional Secretariat recently.
Co-chairmen former MP Muththu Sivalingam and Kotmale UNP Chief Organiser Asoka Herath presided.
Senanayake said cultivation of land above the 5,000 feet level had caused a shortage of water for cultivations below.
Additional Forest Range Officer Bandara Galagoda said his department will take legal action against those responsible for cultivations on land above the 5,000 ft level since such cultivations destroy the forest cover.
He said the Land Reform Commission (LRC) acquired some land belonging to the Forest Department. This was denied by the LRC representative who said that only the land demarcated belonged to his department. Asoka Herath said the LRC owned a limited amount of land in Kotmale. Allocation of large slices of land ranging from eight to 10 acres to a single person was unfair as other needy persons would be denied of land.
A proposal by Asoka Herath to build 50 trade stalls in a section of Kotmale new town lying idle and hand them over to 50 unemployed youths to start a business of their own and to build a reception hall with a seating capacity of 500 was also approved by the committee.
