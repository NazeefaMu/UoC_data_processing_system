GMOA rejects committee appointed to resolve SAITM issue

The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) rejects and opposes the composition of the committee appointed by the President to resolve the SAITM issue, GMOA Media Spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday he said all the members of the committee are pro SAITM and therefore a justifiable solution cannot be expected from the committee. According to Dr. Ananda, the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) and the State Medical Faculty deans have not been given the representation in the committee and therefore a final solution cannot be obtained through the committee.
“<U+200B>No solution can be given from the proposals submitted by the Sate Medical Faculty deans. <U+200B>Whatever solution given by the committee will be a politically influenced solution,” Dr. Ananda said.
