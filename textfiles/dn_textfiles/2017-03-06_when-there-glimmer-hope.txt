When there is a glimmer of hope...

Though life may not be the same after a cancer diagnosis; Manjula, a survivor shows us that life after cancer can be rewarding, exciting, and filled with joy. Along this cancer journey, she says her life was enriched with beautiful people and experiences and took a new meaning with a new direction.
"Although I would not have chosen cancer, I decided to use my energy in a positive way to win the battle."
"I am not dreaming to be rich; all I want is to be happy," she says.
Manjula Abeysinghe is the picture of sophistication and confidence. A professional in the banking sector with nearly 18 years of experience, Manjula is mother to her20 year old daughter and 15 year old son; wife to her doting hotelier husband.
Her journey with cancer began when she was diagnosed in 2015. She had been an active, healthy person hardly ever consulting a doctor. "After turning 40, my husband kept on asking me to get a check-up done and after putting it off for a while I finally did it."
The result of her medical tests threw her off balance. Who would in the superficial prime of health expect a cancer diagnosis?
"My mammogram reports were clear but in another report,the hospital detected something under my arm and wanted to investigate further. Facing a cancer diagnosis is hard, there's no way around that. There is no one alive who has been told they have cancer and who did not wonder if they just had only a few days to live. It's unavoidable. But once I got past that fear and found the right place for treatment, I knew I was going to be fine. I just knew. You have to keep your ears open, your mind open, and your heart open." Manjula spoke with clear conviction.
"My family and friends became my support network. My parents looked after my household, my husband was always there with me through all the hospital visits and treatments. He ensured I ate propernutritious food. This was in 2015 and my daughter was facing her G.C.E. Advanced level exam - there were days when my daughter would have to go and sit for her exam and I would have to go to hospital. She would hug me tearfully before she left for the exam. It was a testing time for all of us as a family.But it all ended well." Manjula says.
"Cancer treatment didn't change my life too much", Manjula says. "But it did change my looks. I lost my hair. I lost weight. All my nails turned black. At first, these side effects were difficult to live with, but I quickly learned to embrace them, and to embrace the beauty within me as a person which couldn't be taken away by medication. I enjoyed putting on make-up." She quips. After completing her treatment cycle and being cleared clinically, she says that she looks at life differently and this is why she wants to give people hope. "I want to help. I don't mind talking to people when I have the time. I want to tell people that this is not the end of the world while I know some people die because of this - you must always be positive," she advises.
"There are wonderful doctors and nurses out there. Find them", she says. "Having a doctor who listens to you and addresses your real needs give you that sense of empowerment which helps you through this kind of life- altering ordeal"
Manjula talks dearly about Dr. Saman Hewamana, Head of Lanka Hospitals Heamato-Oncology Unit. "I had to go to different doctors and after going through several surgeries and treatments I finally met Dr. Hewamana."
Manjula wants to encourage everyone who faces cancer, to have faith. She says that there is hope along their journey and never give up, and to hold on to their dreams. "I believe that what we go through in our lives shape our characters to become who we are. I think it helps us to be stronger to face the unknown future."
Manjula's story is not unique. Many cancer survivors face similar challenges. With a new lease of life, she appreciates everything she has learned from a very painful, but incredibly rewarding and life-changing experience, "I am also determined not to let cancer or the fear of it rule my life." -NM
