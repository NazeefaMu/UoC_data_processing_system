Dialog Champions League 2018 to kick-off in Jaffna

The football fever fresh from the 2018 World Cup is back in the air as the season opener of the eagerly awaited Dialog Champions League 2018 will kick-off under lights for the first time in history at the iconic Duraiyappa Stadium in Jaffna on 21 October from 6pm onwards.
Last year’s second runner-up New Young FC take on Super Sun SC, FFSL and officials from Dialog Axiata officially announced yesterday at the press conference held at FFSL headquarters.
Dialog has been the driving force powering Sri Lanka club football for the past 12 years. The 2018 edition of the Champions league will witness 18 teams and 153 matches with over 60 match referees and 30 match commissioners officiating the matches. After a nail-biting finish in 2017, Colombo FC emerged winners for the third consecutive year beating Renown SC in a hard fought final.
Speaking at the press conference FFSL president Anura de Silva said: “We are inspired by Dialog Axiata’s contributions for all the sports in Sri Lanka. We have increased the prize money from the last edition. We thank all the clubs in Sri Lanka for participating. We have completed all the competitions for the year apart from the Champions league. Throughout the year we have concentrated more on our national squad and the hunting of new talent all over the island. Our team has performed well in the recently concluded South Asian Football tourney held in Bangladesh.”
Speaking further de Silva stated: “I personally feel that unwanted criticism is killing the game as well as the players. We always welcome constructive criticism to find out our shortcomings. We have always done our work transparently.”
The FFSL will introduce AFC game criteria for all the teams for the first time in club matches.
