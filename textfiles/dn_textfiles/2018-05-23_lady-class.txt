Lady with class

It is a remarkable inspiration to each and everyone, young or old, professor or a student, to follow this young Doctor. She is Heshani Karunathilaka, currently attached to the Panadura Base Hospital, in charge of the NCD Unit. She takes special care of the disabled and the youths under 20. Dr Karunatilake has been in the practice for over 18 years.
Dr Karunatilake held her 12th consecutive creative exhibition at the Lagoon View Hotel, Moratuwa, recently. Her creativity began with just a needle and a thread, but with a theme.
The theme of the 12th exhibition coincided with the International Women’s Day. The products displayed were handy kitchen requirements such as tablecloths, serviettes, jug holders and fridge holders.
“I don’t believe, and also not used to, these modern sewing machines. I use my grandma’s sewing machine to sew the helm of the cloth. Whatever I plan the patchwork or any design it is the plain needle and my thimble,” Dr Karunatilake said.
The lady physician does not use her precious time at the hospital for sewing work. She gets into an empty bus and sit in a corner and attends to her passion. At home, she looks forward to the night to apply the finishing touches. She would go on sewing until she falls asleep.
“Oftentimes I felt that my best friend is the needle and thread. My happiness is the outcome of the sewing. This happiness is second only to the feeling I get whenever I see a patient of mine leave the hospital cured,” Dr Karunatilake mused.
Dr Heshani Karunathilake is a practising Christian. Whenever a patient enters her cubicle, she would first place her fingers on the patient and chant a small prayer before prescribing any medicine. This she would continue to do whether her patient is Buddhist, Hindu or Muslim. She treats every patient with a warm smile. The patients, on the other hand, get to see the elegant products on a side.
