G-24  to focus on enhancing inclusive, equitable and climate resilient growth

G-24 will continue to focus on efforts on enhancing inclusive, equitable and climate resilient growth and create employment opportunities, said Minister of Finace and Media Mangala Samaraweera who assumed the Chairmanship of the G-24 on behalf of Sri Lanka.
Minister Samaraweera stated that the G-24 will focus on “continuing our collective and shared efforts to achieve our broad objective of improving living standards of the people in our countries. Experience has shown that growth in output alone is not enough to improve the welfare of the people.
It is widely agreed that transformation of the economy from a fundamentally agrarian, subsistence one to an urbanized, integrated, enterprise-dominated one is important for sustainable economic development”, the Minister added.
Minister Samaraweera underscored the importance of finding financing for development initiatives. He further reiterated that the continued engagement of the Group on inclusive growth and productivity improvement to create employment opportunities will be one of the key priorities. Financing for development remains an urgent priority. Finding ways and means to fulfill this need is another key area that we must focus on at various fora.
The promotion of international trade, innovation and private sector investments will also require our continued attention”, the Minister added.
