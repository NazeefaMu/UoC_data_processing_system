JVP poser on Indo-Lanka Economic Agreement

The government has no clear mandate from the people to sign the Indo-Lanka Economic Agreement, JVP national organiser, MP Bimal Ratnayake said. He said they have received information that the government was continuing with its process of signing the Indo-Lanka Economic Agreement which was subjected to various discussions among employers, industrialists, businessmen and trade unions for about 10 years.
Ratnayake said even former Presidents Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga and Mahinda Rajapaksa couldn’t sign this agreement though they were keen on signing the agreement because they couldn’t prove the advantage of signing the agreement.
“But it is questionable who requested the Maithri-Ranil government to sign this and whether the government has the people’s mandate to do that,” he said.
“According to a letter sent by International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama in reply to a question raised by the JVP in Parliament, a draft of the proposed agreement has already been presented to an Indian delegation,” he said.
Ratnayake also said that by submitting this without informing the people of this country, the government has shown its servile manner.
“It is also questionable as to whom Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is responsible to, the Parliament or to the Indian Prime Minister Modi.”
He said the JVP does not think that Sri Lankan should be isolated.
“Agreements should be signed with other countries. But before signing this type of agreements with India, the government should consider about the unemployment rate of India,” Ratnayake said.
“We do not want to sign agreements by destroying the economic sovereignty of the country,” he added.
