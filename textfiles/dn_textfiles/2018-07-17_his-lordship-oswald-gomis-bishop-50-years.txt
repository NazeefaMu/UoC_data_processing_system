His Lordship Oswald Gomis: A Bishop for 50 years

Archbishop Emeritus Rt. Rev. Dr. Oswald Thomas Colman Gomis celebrates the Golden Jubilee of his consecration as a bishop of the Roman Catholic Church, today.
He was consecrated an Auxiliary Bishop of the Colombo Diocese at the age of 36, along with Very Rev. Fr. Edmund J. Fernando OMI, by the late Thomas Benjamin, Cardinal Cooray, now referred to as ‘Servant of God’. They were nominated to be Auxiliary Bishops by Pope John Paul II, now a saint of the Roman Catholic Church.
The celebration to mark his Golden Jubilee will be held on Sunday, July 22, at 5pm, at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH). A thanksgiving Holy Mass will be offered on Monday, July 23, at 5pm, at All Saints’ Church, Borella.
Oswald Gomis was ordained in 1958. From 1961, Fr. Gomis served as the Editor of the Gnanartha Pradeepaya - the Catholic weekly – and as the Director of the Colombo Catholic Press. In 1968 he was chosen to be one of the two Auxiliary Bishops of the Colombo Archdiocese.
Bishop Gomis has contributed immensely to all sections of society while working as a member of a number of committees, both religious and secular, and has won the praise and admiration of all communities and religious leaders.
Bishop Gomis was appointed Chancellor of the University of Colombo in 2001, a post he holds to date.
Even to this day, he lives in the hearts of the Buddhists of this country, as a very close friend and a brother to the Maha Sanga, with his meritorious act of offering dana to the Venerable Buddhist Clergy at the official residence of the Colombo Archbishop, for the first time in the history of the country.
The Colombo Diocese was created a See by Pope Gregory XVI on December 03, 1834, by the decree Exmunere Pastorale and renamed the Archdiocese in 1947. The then Coadjutor Bishop was Rt. Rev. Dr. Thomas Cooray OMI.
Rt. Rev. Dr. Mary Masson OMI was the last European to serve the Colombo Diocese as Archbishop. With the demise of Bishop Masson, the Coadjutor Bishop Thomas Cooray OMI assumed the See of the Colombo Archdiocese as the first Sri Lankan Archbishop.
His Lordship Rt. Rev. Dr. Gomis served 28 years as Auxiliary Bishop in the Archdiocese of Colombo and was made Bishop of Anuradhapura, the portal of Buddhist heritage, in 1996.
Bishop Gomis, who served as the shepherd of the Anuradhapura Diocese for close to six years, assumed duties as the Archbishop of Colombo in 2002, succeeding Rt. Rev. Dr. Nicholas Marcus Fernando, who went on retirement at the end of his Canonical term of service.
With the passage of time, His Lordship Rt. Rev. Dr. Edmund Fernando OMI assumed duties as the Second Bishop of the Badulla Diocese, carved out from the Diocese of Kandy, with the passing away of Rt. Rev. Dr. Leo Nanayakkaara OSB, the first bishop of the Badulla Diocese.
Although Bishop Gomis retired from active service after serving seven years as the head of the Catholic Church in Sri Lanka from July 6, 2002 to June 11, 2009 and now lives in the quiet surroundings of the Tewatte Basilica, he has not giving up his research or his writing.
Archbishop Gomis is held in high esteem among the elite, scholars and intellectuals, for his professionalism, knowledge, lucidity and clarity of thought. Thanks to Fr. Jacome Gonsalvez, the efforts of Saint Joseph Vaz in implanting the Catholic Faith in Sri Lanka has been well documented.
In similar fashion, the continuing research and education of the public by Bishop Gomis reminds us of the service rendered by Bishop Edmund Peiris, Frs. Nicholas Perera, Don Peter, D.J. Anthony, Andrew Peter Fernando, Joseph Jayasuriya, Marcelline Jayakody and other priests and religious who faithfully trod the path of the erudite scholarly Goan priest Jacome Gonsalvez, and made their mark in their respective fields.
The initiative and the leadership of Bishop Gomis to present the modified Cross of St. Thomas, used in introducing the Catholic faith to Sri Lanka, as the symbol of the Catholic flag in the country won high praise from those who are familiar with the work of this prolific writer who has authored several books in Sinhala and English to prove the Catholic presence.
Bishop Gomis was born on December 12, 1932, to the family of Vincent and Rosaline of Sinharamulla, Kelaniya, and grew up in the midst of Catholic and Buddhist influence. He took his first steps to learn to read and write at St. Paul’s Roman Catholic Sinhala School at Waragoda. He then came under the guidance of the De La Salle Brothers while at St. Benedict’s College, Kotahena and later studied at St. Joseph’ s College, Maradana.
He entered St. Aloysius Minor Seminary at Borella on January 16, 1950, as an 18-year-old youth when Rev. Fr. Sevarines Fernando OMI was Rector of that institution.
Within a very short period of time, he entered St. Bernard’s Major Seminary, which was housed in the present Aquinas College. The seminary is now at Ampitiya, Kandy, and stands as the major seminary in the island, dedicated to Our Lady of Lanka. Bishop Gomis was ordained at the age of 26, on February 3, 1958, by Rt. Rev. Dr. Thomas Benjamin Cooray OMI, the then Archbishop of Colombo.
Bishop Gomis imprinted his impeccable, irrevocable ‘Gomis’ sign as the Editor of Gnanartha Pradeepaya and played the lead role in celebrating its centenary, in 1966.
He took the initiative in introducing Lama Pradeepaya for children, as a supplement to the Catholic weekly. His introduction of the Pahan Poth series, Pradeepa Poth and Minipahana Poth, as the then editor, won him high regard and recognition.
Bishop Gomis, well versed both in Sinhala and English, has contributed valuable articles to other newspapers and periodicals. He was awarded an honorary Doctorate in Philosophy from Fu Jen University, one of the ancient universities in China, in recognition of his service to humanity and obtained his Doctorate in Education from Adamson University in the Philippines.
Bishop Gomis who assumed duties on July 27, 2002, as the third Archbishop of Colombo has won the love and appreciation of the Maha Sanga and other religious dignitaries and leading figures in society.
His contribution in the field of education is noteworthy. He is responsible for establishing a number of branch schools of the leading Catholic colleges in Colombo.
Bishop Gomis served as Secretary General of the Asian Bishops’ Conference on two occasions. Thanks to his efforts, Catholics the world over have the privilege of listening to Radio Veritas, the Catholic news service, in 14 languages, from Manila, Philippines.
Bishop Gomis shared the responsibility with the media personality, recognized author and the Diamond Jubilarian Fr. Ernest Poruthota, in introducing and opening a branch of the prestigious OCIC which caters to the progress of electronic media and cinema. They were both influenced by the role played in this regard by the ex-Oblate priest Noel Cruz.
Bishop Gomis imprinted his mark in the hearts and minds of those who were affected by the Boxing Day Tsunami in 2004, in helping them to obtain permanent shelter by encouraging every segment of society here and overseas to assist.
He also initiated scholarship programmes to assist children living in dire poverty. He has donated 14 acres of land in Kelaniya to set up a home for the aged and a medical centre, close to his hometown for tsunami victims.
The Bishops’ Conference Secretariat at Balcomb Place, Borella, stands out as a monument to his effort and dedication to service while playing the role of Secretary General of the Sri Lanka Catholic Bishops’ Conference.
Archbishop Emeritus Rt. Rev. Dr. Oswald Thomas Colman Gomis who has travelled to nearly 50 countries will celebrate his 87th birthday on December 12. May he enjoy the love and protection of the Divine Lord, good health and live a trouble-free life full of happiness in the days to come.
