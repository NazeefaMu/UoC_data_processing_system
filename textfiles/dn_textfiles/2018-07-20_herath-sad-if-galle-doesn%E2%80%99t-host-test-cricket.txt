Herath sad if Galle doesn’t host Test cricket

The world’s and Sri Lanka’s leading left-arm spinner Rangana Herath expressed his sadness if the Galle International Cricket Stadium does not host anymore Test matches after 2019.
“Personally, it’s a memorable place for me. I think I need only two wickets to complete 100 wickets in Galle. I will be disappointed if they take Tests away from Galle. Sad if that happens,” said Herath.
The Galle Stadium is under threat of being moved to a different location as some its buildings obstructed the view of the historic Galle Dutch Fort which has been declared a world heritage site by UNESCO.– ST
