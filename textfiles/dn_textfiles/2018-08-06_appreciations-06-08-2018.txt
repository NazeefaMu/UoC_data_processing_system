Remembering Prof. Nandasena Ratnapala

We meet and we partIn this journey through sansaraBut the meeting or parting does not end with time or yearsIt is a long stretch of an eventful roadWhere milestones matter more than rises or fallsWe have travelled together on this hard, endless roadWhere milestones matter more than rises or fallsThe journey was neither smooth nor full of magical moments aloneBut many achievements reached more worth than monuments in goldLeaving a fragrance that would linger on and unfoldGifting a memory of a life rich and rareNow you are gone as you wished on a fateful mornWhile family, friends and students remember and mournA warm tear drops that none would see or feelAs I ponder about you, while my memory unfolds your sight.
Neetha S. Ratnapala
