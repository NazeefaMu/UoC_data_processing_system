Govt. has to look into SAITM students’ future: MP Jayawardena

The future of the SAITM students has to be looked into by whatever government, although it was set up during the Rajapaksa regime, said United National Party Parliamentarian Kavinda Jayawardena yesterday.
He said it has been set up with a government loan of Rs. 600 million during the previous regime. He added although it was set up with low standards, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa granted scholarships to the children of ministers, MPs and even to a girl who sang for him.
He said the former President was a dictator, so nobody dared to question him. “However, now everyone speaks of this since democracy is functioning under the good governance regime,” MP Jayawardena said. “This is the difference.”
He was responding to a query made by a media personnel during a press conference held at the UNP party headquarters - Sirikotha.
MP Jayawardena said for a period of five years until 2015, the government had allowed to recruit around 1,000 students and the parents had paid for them. The students had studied there, so they should be allowed to continue their studies.
“The UNP, as a policy, does not object to private medical faculties,” MP Jayawardena said. “If one objects, all kindergarten schools, international schools, other private education institutions and tuition classes should not be allowed to function.”
He pointed out that however, thousands of parents send their children to foreign medical colleges to study and they come back to sit for the examination to practice here. He pointed out that there are limitations on the tax money that a government can allocate for education. He added that due to this reason, there should be some other institution set up at the same location in the future, even with private partnership.
