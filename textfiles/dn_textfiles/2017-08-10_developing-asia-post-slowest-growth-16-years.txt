Developing Asia to post slowest growth in 16 years

The rebalancing of China’s economy and policy uncertainty in advanced economies means developing Asia could record its slowest annual growth in 16 years, the Manila-based Asian Development Bank said in its annual outlook.
Developing Asia, which comprises 45 countries in the Asia Pacific, will expand 5.7 per cent in 2017 and 2018, a slight deceleration from the 5.8 per cent posted in 2016, according to the ADB’s latest Asian Development Outlook, released on Thursday.
The forecast by the bank is the weakest for the region since it grew 5 per cent in 2001.
The region remains the largest single contributor to global growth, at 60 per cent, the report shows. Growth is recorded as picking up in two-thirds of economies in developing Asia, supported by higher external demand, rebounding global commodity prices, and domestic reforms.
“Developing Asia continues to drive the global economy even as the region adjusts to a more consumption-driven economy in the People’s Republic of China and looming global risks,” said Yasuyuki Sawada, the ADB’s chief economist.
“While uncertain policy changes in advanced economies do pose a risk to the outlook, we feel that most economies are well positioned to weather potential short-term shocks,” said Sawada.
Growth in China, the world’s second largest economy, continues to moderate as the government implements measures to move the economy towards a more consumption-driven model.
Overall output is expected to slow to 6.5 per cent in 2017 and 6.2 per cent in 2018, down from 2016’s 6.7 per cent. Efforts to maintain financial and fiscal stability will continue to be a modest drag on growth going forward, but continued structural reform will help to maintain growth in the government’s target range.
