Lancashire beat leaders Notts

LONDON, Sunday - Lancashire took just over an hour to finish off Nottinghamshire as they beat the County Championship Division One leaders by an innings and 67 runs.
Seam bowler Graham Onions took three of the wickets at Trent Bridge to finish with 6-55 and match figures of 9-77. England’s James Anderson warmed up for Test duty by taking two wickets in his 4-26 haul, for match figures of 6-53.
Lancashire’s first victory of the season was their first top-flight away win since beating Northants in 2014.
England captain Joe Root was dismissed twice in a day as Yorkshire were forced to follow on by Surrey at The Oval.
Having begun day three on 40-3, the visitors were all out for 229 despite 95 from Jonny Bairstow, 185 behind. All-rounder Sam Curran claimed 6-54, having Root lbw for 14, as he reached 100 first-class wickets.
Root was later bowled through the gate for 23 by Amar Virdi, who also removed Adam Lyth (58) and Harry Brook as Yorkshire reached stumps on 142-5.
Simon Harmer and the departing Peter Siddle took five wickets each as Essex held their nerve to beat Worcestershire for their second victory of the season.
Australia paceman Siddle, whose five-game deal has come to an end, finished with 5-37 to help the county champions over the line by 32 runs. Travis Head (62) offered resistance for Worcestershire but was the last to fall as Harmer claimed figures of 5-43.
The hosts were chasing a target of 215 after Essex were all out for 275. At 160-5, they looked slight favourites, but Essex took the last four wickets for just 22 runs to decide the match without the need for a final day.
James Hildreth scored 184 as batsmen dominated between Somerset and Hampshire on day three at Taunton.
Hildreth struck 22 boundaries and passed 150 for the 15th time in first-class cricket as he and Dom Bess (92) put on 145 for the ninth-wicket. Jack Leach (22) and Tim Groenewald (25 not out) also contributed as the hosts moved from 324-7 overnight to post 506.
James Vince (63 not out) and Hashim Amla (86 not out) guided Hampshire to 178-2 at stumps, still 97 in arrears.
Warwickshire opener Will Rhodes made his maiden first-class century to help the County Championship Division Two leaders beat Northants at Edgbaston and earn their third straight win.
Warwicks made short work of finishing off Northants, who resumed on 160-7. Paceman Olly Stone took two of the three wickets to finish with 5-45 as his old team were bowled out for 187.
Left a target of 179 to win, Rhodes then hit an unbeaten 100, reaching his century with the winning boundary.
Matt Henry starred with bat and ball as Kent beat Sussex by 58 runs to clinch a third successive Division Two win.
Henry smashed five fours and three sixes in vital 55 to push Kent’s score on from 125-4 overnight to 235, setting Sussex 270 for victory in Canterbury. The New Zealand fast bowler then took 6-53 to dismiss Sussex for 211 and reach 37 wickets for the season.
Luke Wright (47) and Ben Brown (48) batted well, but their dismissals saw Sussex slip to their first defeat.
Leicestershire won their first Championship game since September 2016 as they scraped a thrilling three-run victory over Glamorgan, who were dismissed for 247.
Marchant de Lange clubbed eight sixes in his career-best 90, before being caught on the boundary off Ben Raine aiming for the winning blow. Raine starred with bat and ball with a vital 65 and figures of 4-44.
Glamorgan looked buried at 139-8 but de Lange ensured an astonishing finish.
Stuart Poynter and Michael Richardson re-wrote the Durham record books as both scored centuries on day three against Derbyshire.
Poynter hit a career-best 170 off 206 balls and Richardson made 115 as they put on 278 in Durham’s 520 all out. It was a new Durham sixth-wicket record stand, and the club’s highest for any wicket against Derbyshire.
Tony Palladino took 4-87 for the home side, who had to face two overs before closing on 1-0, still 92 runs behind.
Middlesex enforced the follow-on as they continued to dominate by taking 12 Gloucestershire wickets on day three.
With the hosts having declared on 455-8, Gloucestershire started brightly but failed to build partnerships after opener James Bracey (28) was caught. Chris Dent (66) and Benny Howell (47) dug in but Hilton Cartwright’s career-best 4-33 helped bowl them out for 210.
The visitors were put in again after tea at Lord’s, losing Howell and Dent again to close 179 runs behind on 66-2.
