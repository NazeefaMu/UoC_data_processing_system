Police sticker scam in Hatton

A group posing as the Police has been selling stickers to three-wheeler drivers in Hatton, collecting a substantial sum of money, said drivers of the Hatton Three-wheeler Association.
The sticker, highlighted with the official Police logo and colours of white and blue, contains details of the Police station such as the phone number, area, the Police emergency contact number and a popular phrase used by a State television channel on its accident prevention campaign. They have sold the tickets for Rs. 150 a piece.
Alarmingly, the group has also handed the drivers a form to be filled with their personal information and details of their vehicle.
These stickers have been sold not only in Hatton, but also in Bogawanthalawa, Norwood and surrounding towns on November 18. As suspicion began to grow over the stickers, the drivers had questioned them and said they would complain about this to the Police and media. Thereafter, the group had fled the area.
When Hatton ASP Dassanayake was contacted with regard to the scam, he said the campaign had no involvement of the Police and that it was probably an act by an organization or certain individuals. Interestingly, he admitted that the forms containing personal information of the drivers were handed over to the Police by the group. The ASP who did not perceive anything wrong in the campaign added that it was up to the driver to paste the sticker on his three-wheeler or not.
