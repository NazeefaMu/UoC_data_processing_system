Ceylinco  General  Insurance  settles flood claims fast

Speedy settlement of flood claims by Ceylinco General Insurance has enabled thousands of its customers to bounce back to normalcy in the shortest possible time, feedback received by the company reveals. Staff of Ceylinco General Insurance acted promptly to pay compensation to all of its policy holders with flood cover affected by the recent floods within 14 days, fulfilling its promise of swift settlement of claims, which is the hallmark of the company’s policy. Accordingly, over 1,400 claims were paid to Warehouses, Go-downs, Shops, Offices, Factories, Construction sites, Home Owners and all types of vehicles.
Several individuals affected by the floods expressed their gratitude to Ceylinco General Insurance for the relief measures taken by the company, such as providing them with drinking water and cooked meals and for the assistance given to them to move to safe places during the first few days of the flooding.
Ajith Gunawardena, Chief Executive Officer of Ceylinco General Insurance said, “The recent floods were a sad natural catastrophe and we consider such events as national disasters. Very little could be done to prevent such calamities in the short term. But what we can do is to pay compensation to the victims speedily for them to return to their normal lives within the shortest possible time.”
Patrick Alwis, Managing Director, said, “Our large network of in-house risk engineers based island-wide helped us to settle claims within no time. Also, we have comprehensively covered ourselves to face the challenges posed by such disasters.”
