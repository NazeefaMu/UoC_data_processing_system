Germany promises continued support for tourism development

Sri Lanka is targeting 150,000 German tourists this year. This was revealed during a meeting between Tourism Development Minister John Amaratunge and Germany’s Federal Economic Affairs and Energy Minister Brigitte Zypries on the sidelines of the ongoing ITB in Berlin. Zypries is also Germany’s Tourism Minister.
Federal Minister Zypries assured Minister Amaratunga that Germany will extend its fullest co-operation to develop Sri Lanka’s tourism industry since the country is now considered one of the safest destinations for European travellers. “German travellers are always talking about the warm hospitality and friendliness of the Sri Lankan people. They are very eager to return to the country over and over again,” Minister Zypries said.
Minister Amaratunga thanked the German government for supporting tourism development in Sri Lanka. The Minister noted that Sri Lanka received 134,275 German tourists last year indicating a growth of 15% compared to the previous year. He said that ITB will be used as a stepping stone to carry out an aggressive tourism promotion campaign in Germany this year.
It was further revealed during the discussions that Sri Lanka Tourism has already embarked on a promotional campaign focusing on different regions in Germany.
Minister Amaratunga told the German Minister that Sri Lanka was proud to have partnered with ITB from its inception. A record contingent of Sri Lanka’s tourism industry stakeholders are participating at this year’s ITB. (SS)
