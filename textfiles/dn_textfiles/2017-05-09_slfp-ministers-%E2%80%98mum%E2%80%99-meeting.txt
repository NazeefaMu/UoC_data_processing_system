SLFP Ministers ‘mum’ on meeting

President Maithripala Sirsena yesterday had a meeting with a number of SLFP Ministers at his residence in Colombo 7, SLFP sources told the Daily News.
However, none of the Ministers were willing to comment on what was discussed at the meeting. Reliable sources said that they have been told not to divulge any information relating to the meeting which lasted for over two hours.
“The meeting has reportedly focused on the matters relating to the issues of the unity government,” sources said.
