Running Wild in Lanka

An episode of Running Wild featuring Mike Horn and Matt Pokora was filmed in the Samanala Wewa region in Sri Lanka with Eco Team as the official logistics provider. The area which is more than 10km away from human inhabitancy meant that the cast and crew had to trek with all their equipment. The film crew also camped in the great outdoors in close proximity to wild elephants and other animals. To ensure that the smooth operations of filming this episode, Eco Team put together a logistics crew of close to 75 members.
Speaking on this significant feat Eco Team Founder and Chief Experience Officer, Anurudhdha Bandara said efficiency is of high importance in such situations as time and resources are very limited. “Food and drinks had to be provided for the crew from a distance of more than six km away, merely on foot and this is no easy task but Eco Team was equipped with the labour, facilities and equipment needed to complete this challenge. In creating an adventure programme watched by millions around the world, Eco Team had an adventure of our own making sure that the team truly experienced Sri Lanka,” he said.
