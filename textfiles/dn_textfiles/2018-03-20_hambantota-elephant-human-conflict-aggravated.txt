Hambantota elephant - human conflict aggravated

The elephant - human conflict has aggravated in the Hambantota district during the last week costing two human lives in Sooriyawewa and causing damage to nearly 10 houses by rampaging elephants. According to Wildlife officials, the main cause for this is large scale clearing of jungle land and improper human activity.
Among the villages threatened by wild elephants are Weliara, Bandagiriya, Samarakoon wewa, Katuwewa, Kude Welpokuna, Tammennawa, Uthpala, Walsapugala, Andarawewa, Joolwewa, Elalla, Kadjuwagawa, Mattala, Kuda Indiwewa, Bogahaidiwewa, Karametiya, Mahagalwewa, Aluthgamara, Suruwinigama, Konketiara, Wewegama, Namadagaswewa, Madunagala, Seenimodarayaya, Hasthipura, Atekanuwa, Andigama, Mahaara, Talalla, Koggalla, Habarattawela, Unudiya Pokuna and Mahapelessa. People allege that Wildlife officials fail to drive away the rampaging elephants before they cause immense damage to their food crops.
Meanwhile, Wildlife officials said that they receive nearly 50 complaints a day regarding rampaging elephants but they could not attend to them at once due to lack of staff and other equipment.
It was natural for elephants to invade villages when they are restricted to a small strip of jungle land as a result of on going development projects such as the Matara-Mattala Expressway.
They have a major burden on their lands because they had to protect both human and elephant lives during this exercise.
