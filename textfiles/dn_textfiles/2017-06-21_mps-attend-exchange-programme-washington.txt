MPs attend exchange programme in Washington

The House Democracy Partnership (HDP) of the United States Congress welcomed members of parliament of four HDP partner countries, including Sri Lanka to an exchange programme in the second week of June.
A bipartisan group of members of the Sri Lankan Parliament comprising State Minister of Agriculture Wasantha Aluwihare, Deputy Minister of Mahaweli Development and Environment Anuradha Jayaratne, Keheliya Rambukwella, Buddhika Pathirana and Eswarapatham Saravanapavan participated in this programme.
The exchange programme allowed the members of parliament to share lessons and experiences with their peers on the parliament’s role and interacted with U.S. members of congress, congressional staff and U.S. experts on matters such as improving citizen security, social inclusion, peace building, reconciliation and stimulating economic growth in post conflict societies.
The Sri Lanka Parliament and the House Democracy Partnership of the U.S. House of Representatives entered into a Collaboration Agreement to strengthen partnership between the two legislatures last September.
