[APPRECIATIONS - (25-09-2017)]

Binoy Surendra
Charismatic Journalist
My association with Binoy Kumar Wickrama Surendra goes back to the time we were together during my days at Lake House in the 1960's. I was attached to the advertising Department then. Very often, I used to visit the Dinamina editorial to meet my long-standing friend Thilaka Kuruwita Bandara who was a sub-editor there. It was then that I met Binoy Surendra who too was a sub-editor.
I remember that we struck an immediate rapport and I found in him something unique not only as a journalist, but also as a gentlemen. He possessed wonderful human qualities, the epitome of compassion for the needy, among other virtues. Sharing is one of the greatest joys in life, and we regularly shared our knowledge and happiness with our friends at Lake House.
He was an understanding person to whom one could go with problems even of a very personal nature. He had moral stature and was a guiding light and a mentor to me and was concerned about my welfare.
It was by sheer hard work and because of his integrity that he rose to the top as a sub-editor and associate-editor. His veins were filled with ink and he made catchy headlines that proved his journalistic excellence, also as a page maker.
In 1979, when television was introduced to Sri Lanka, he sensed a huge potential for growth in TV technology. Consequently, he started the Institute of Television Technology (ITVT) during the same year. This school of TV technology, which was the first in this country, fulfilled a great national need of that time.
I remember the day it was launched followed by a colourful conference with the participation of leading media experts including Dr. Sarath Amunugama, the then Director Information, Dr. Anura Gunasekera, Tissa Abeysekera, Andrew Jayamane, Leslie Bothegue, Edwin Ariyadasa, H. M. Gunasekera, Mahinda Ranaweera and Givantha Arthasad.
From the youngest to the oldest, students took part in variety of programmes such as film script-writing, TV techniques, themes and camera work etc. These courses were conducted according to the syllabus and guidelines of the ‘City and Guilds Institute’ of London by able instructor engineer Jayantha Gunawardane of the Ceylon Air Force. Some of these students, who play a prominent role in today's society include: Sumithra Rahubadha, Anoma Rajakaruna, Padmini Abeysekera, Gordon Silva, Sisira Wijesinghe and Ananda Dissanayake.
Binoy was the only child of one-time media giant Sirus W. Surendra who also did a prominent role in the film ‘Dingiri Menika.' Binoy was married to ayurvedic doctor Mallika Hemalatha Perera and blessed with three daughters and a son. Binoy was a inspiration to all who knew him.
It will be ever so difficult for Mallika, his daughters Chandima, Athma, Vinodha and his son, Ranga, to come to grips with the reality the void created by his absence.
It will be a constant reminder that the affectionate tower of strength behind their family is no more. He passed away on August 20 at the age of 76.
His death was a tremendous blow to us all. Binoy did not realize that his time to leave this world would come so soon, leaving all of us in tears.
I salute you for your passion for and commitment to journalism, for your nurturing of others, your deep devotion to your family and your understanding, acceptance and love.
On behalf of your family and friends, dearest Binoy, I say goodbye. Hopefully to meet you once again as a journalist in the journey of Sansara.

Mano Muthukrishna
A true trailblazer
Mano Muthukrishna, whom I always called 'darling,' was an outstanding woman who will live on in the minds and hearts of all who knew her. Her fragrance will always permeate and her memory remain entrenched, for she was truly a trailblazer and one who raised the bar for both men and women.
Manoramabai was her full name and like her name, there was much that was distinctive about her. She made a lasting impression on me when as a schoolgirl. I first set eyes on this regal woman, stunningly beautiful, elegantly clad and upright of bearing. Piercing of eye and sharp of wit, nothing missed darling!
She had an iron will and determination to get things done despite all odds and put her heart and soul into all she undertook. Latterly despite her age, her social and professional calendar rivalled that of her daughters Ramola and Sharadha, who were often amazed at her stamina and sheer energy.
Blessed with parents who instilled in her the fact that women could do anything, she sought throughout her life to empower people and help them. She immersed herself in the lives of others and this was why she was such a great listener, conversationalist and friend, a mine of information on any subject. Always well-informed and abreast of both local and international news, Darling prided herself on being current! In fact, till recently, she was on Facebook and e-mail!
She was of course meticulous with detail and especially with the English. The staff at the Polytechnic were totally loyal to her and were tremendously proud of their association with someone of her calibre . A dedicated professional and ardent social worker, Darling introduced the Zonta movement to Sri Lanka 50 years ago.
The Club in Colombo is part of Zonta International and she was the Charter Secretary of Zonta Club 1 of Colombo which is celebrating its jubilee year this year. She inaugurated Zonta Club 2 of Colombo and Zonta now has four Clubs in Colombo and one in Kandy.
The Zonta Woman of Achievement Awards was her brainchild which she started 35 years ago and continues to this day. She was also a member and office bearer of the Sri Lanka Women's Conference, a founder member of the Women's Chamber of Industry and Commerce, the Founder President of the SAARC Women's Organisation, an active member and an office bearer of the Forum on Ageing an NGO which cares for the elderly, while she was also committed to the Colombo Chetty Association.
She held the position of Representative for Trinity College, London, for several years and also represented the Institute of Financial Accountants, UK and was the Chairperson of The Polytechnic Pvt Ltd. for many years.
A woman of strong principles, Darling knew only right and wrong and had no patience with the many shades of grey so prevalent today.
She was so very proud of her daughters and her many grandchildren and great grandchildren, who continue to uphold her values and ethics.
Darling’s physical presence may be absent, but her enduring spirit and all she stood for and upheld in life will continue to live on.
In fact, I’m convinced that even up there with the Almighty, Darling will be trailblazing in her own inimitable style!
In her own words, “what I do know for sure is that the good things in my life have far, far outweighed the bad, and I thank God for sustaining me through the best and worst of life. At least life was never dull.”

S. de S. Jayasinghe
He was a strong pillar
Forty years ago on September 26, 1977, S. de S. Jayasinghe, then Minister of Fisheries in the J. R. Jayawardane government, passed away. His sudden death was indeed a very sad moment not only to his family, but to the people of Dehiwela as well.
He was a humble human being, a man of all seasons, he left a legacy etched in the hearts of all those touched by him.
Born on January 6, 1911, in Papeliyana, a village suburb to Colombo City, he had his education at Ananda Sasthralaya, Kotte. He was in Government Service for a short period. Thereafter, he commenced his own business and became a very successful businessman who helped the needy. Senior citizens of this area still remembers him granting them season tickets for free of travel in his bus service, The Gamini Bus Co. Ltd., which was nationalised as a policy of the Bandaranaika government.
In 1944, he entered politics from the UNP, contesting the Dehiwela-Mt. Lavinia Urban Council.
He was elected as the chairman. During the 33 years for his Local Government Politics, he was the Mayor of the Dehiwela-Mt. Lavinia Municipal Council as well. In 1952, he contested the Parliamentary election, defeated Dr. Colvin R. de Silva and was elected to Parliament. Again in 1965, he won the Parliamentary election and was appointed a Deputy Minister. In 1977, he was appointed as a Cabinet Minister. Jayasinghe was a strong pillar to the UNP. His services to the party were honest and dedicated. He closely associated the late leaders of the UNP Rt. D. S. Senanayake, Dudley Senanayake, Sir John Kotalawela and J. R. Jayawardane. I still could remember very well, J. R. Jayawardane as the Prime Minister in 1977 attending Jayasinghe's funeral. In his speech, he said Jayasinghe accompanied him as a brave man at the protest march in 1957 from Colombo to Kandy.
As a strong Buddhist, he worked very closely with the clergy and offered a memorable service to his religion. Colombo South Kalubowila Hospital and pipe-borne water to the Dehiwela Mt. Lavinia City limits are two projects launched during his term of office. His sudden departure from our midst certainly created a vaccum which is not easy to forget. But Jayasinghe has gifted us a daughter who was couragous enough to step in to her father's shoes and follow his foot steps. On November 11, 1977, people of Dehiwela elected Sunethra Ranasinghe as their representative. Since then, for the last 40 years, she has continued her father's commitments successfully to the betterment of the people. S. de S. Jayasinghe left us 40 years ago, but memories of him are in our hearts for ever.
May you attain Nirvana!

Dr. Sarath Abeykoon
A compassionate doctor
It is not only because Dr. Sarath Abeykoon was my Consultant Oncologist that I decided to write this tribute. To me, he was more than that. While I was undergoing Tomotherapy at Ceylinco Healthcare Services Ltd., I used to see him moving around and on many an occasion he would stop to talk to a patient if he casually came across one.
Dr. Abeykoon revelled in taking down copious notes of the consultation process with red and blue ball point pens. Time didn’t matter to him. I had 37 sessions of Tomotherapy. After that I had the longest period of remission in the entire history of my cancer. As cancer does most often, it returned and in my case metastasized to lung cancer. So along with my niece Sandya Salgado, I had to visit Dr. Abeykoon after a relatively long period of time. He remembered and recognised me at once. He examined thoroughly all the X-ray plates and simply asked me “so what’s the problem?” I said I have lung cancer and that’s why I came to see you. Patiently and convincingly, he explained to me that there was nothing that could be done therapeutically at my age; had I been fifty years younger, there would have been other options available to him. He said my cancer was on the peripheral part of the lung, but could change to haemorrhaging at the centre, in which event he would have to give me some palliative radiation.
Dr. Abeykoon loved repartee. Some would say the patient knows best and being human always lives in hope. I hadn’t realized that I had succumbed to this conventional wisdom when I asked Dr. Abeykoon about a PET scan? He sharply reacted when he said “do you want your PET scan framed and hung on your bedroom wall?”
With the calmness and righteousness of a mature visionary, he thus defined for me life’s inevitability.
But portentously he said “I will be on leave for six weeks and you can see me only then.” Having said that, he got up from his seat, held my wheelchair and pushed it until up to the entrance of his consultancy room, filled with compassion.
How often do we see consultants (even those whom we know personally) recognize and greet you while you are waiting in the room with other patients? How often will a consultant get up from his seat to greet you? How often will a consultant push your wheelchair and even if you can find one, how long is a consultant prepared to spend time during a consultation?
To Dr. Sarath Abeykoon, these things did not matter. The total time he spent with me at the last consultation was over an hour. And that hour reflected a part of a man whose values and of professionalism and humanity transcended pure personal gain.

He was an inspiration
Four years have passed since our life’s pillar, its very foundation, was taken away from us. It hurts to think that you are not here anymore and with each beat of our hearts, we miss you and treasure the time we had with you.
We grew up with your faith and wisdom of your words, the strength of your mind and the warmth of your love–all of which are instilled in us forever. You inspire the best in us. Thank you for all that you were to us and to all the people whose lives you have touched and inspired. As an accomplished scholar, you were dedicated to education and applied everything in life with amazing innovation. When you conversed, you made it easy for all to connect because you treated everyone with a great deal of respect.
You always gave without an ounce of hesitation. Countless people continue to tell us how you helped them in various ways, what an inspiration you were to them and what a great man you were. You were clearly loved and idolized by even more than we realized. How could one man contribute so much love to his family, his friends and even those he barely knew? Your legacy of wisdom, integrity and courage will go on forever.
You were the greatest father anyone could ever have. Death may have taken you away from us, but our life’s hero you’ll forever be. We miss you everyday.
May you attain the supreme bliss of Nibbana!
Lovingly remembered and sadly missed by your children.
