Lankans’ life expectancy will increase in next few years - Rajitha

The life expectancy of Sri Lankans will significantly increase in the next few years as a result of reducing drug prices and providing free eye lenses and heart stents, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
He was addressing a press conference held at the Government Information Department Auditorium in Colombo yesterday.
He said a female journalist of an English newspaper had written fabricated and inaccurate facts on reduced drug prices to mislead people on behalf of two drug companies that lost their small market here.
Minister Senaratne said that no drug company has informed that they would leave Sri Lankan market against the drug price reduction and there will be no high quality drug shortage in Sri Lanka as predicted by certain newspapers.
“Even though those two companies left Sri Lanka, it would not impact us because the drug brands being sold by them do not have a market in Sri Lanka,” the Minister said. “Only 180 capsules of their drugs are sold in Sri Lanka,” the Minister said.
The Minister said these two companies may leave the country because they do not have a market here.
“This English newspaper promoted tobacco companies and misled the public when the 90 per cent tax was imposed on tobacco. Now this newspaper does the same for money on behalf of drug companies.
Especially, one drug company behind this campaign owns a private hospital. It opposes the upcoming price reduction of private hospital charges. The high charges of private hospitals will be regulated soon,” the Minister said.
The Minister said these companies held a meeting in a five-star hotel recently to prevent importers from bringing in insulin to Sri Lanka and create an artificial shortage but the rest opposed their move, the Minister said.
