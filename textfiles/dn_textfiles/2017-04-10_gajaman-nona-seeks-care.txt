Gajaman Nona seeks care

The Gajaman Nona statue at Nonagama remains exposed to a state of dilapidation.
Gajaman Nona (1746-1815) was a poetess of exceptional beauty. She was named Dona Isabella Cornelia Perumal and received baptism at the Bambalapitiya, Milagiriya Church.
The Ambalantota DS area boasts many other historical places named after the legendary poetess.
