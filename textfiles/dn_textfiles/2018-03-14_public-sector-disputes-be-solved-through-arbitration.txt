Public sector disputes to be solved through arbitration

The Public Administration and Management Ministry has commenced discussions with the International Labour Organization (ILO) to start an arbitration process for resolving disputes in the public sector.
Public Administration and Management Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara said that his ministry plans to start an arbitration unit for resolving disputes in the public sector in collaboration with the Labour and Labour Relations Ministry and with the technical expertise of the ILO.
An initial discussion was held recently with the participation of Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara, ILO Country Director Simrin Singh and other senor ILO and ministerial officials, at the ministry. The ILO stated that the public sector is the country’s biggest employer with 1.4 million workers.
Therefore, more attention should be focused on the contribution made by public servants to the economic and social indices of the country.
The minister stressed the importance of introducing an arbitration process to create a strong public sector. The dispute resolution mechanism should be started to pave the way for a strike- and trade union action free–public sector,” he added.
