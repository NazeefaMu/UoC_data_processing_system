SLTDA closes Mirissa surf bar, full probe on tourist attack

The Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority has ordered the closure of the surf bar and restaurant in Mirissa where a group of Dutch tourists were assaulted, until the investigations are completed, a SLTDA official told the Daily News.
Following the arrest of six persons suspected of the sexual and physical assault on a group of tourists in Mirissa on April 8, action has been taken by the police to conduct an identification parade by bringing down two of the victims who have left the country, while all their travel expenses will be borne by the Tourism Ministry. This was revealed at a press conference convened at the Tourism Ministry yesterday. Police Spokesman SP Gunasekara said in light of this incident, a block of land had been acquired to set up a tourist police post in Mirissa.
The SLTDA states that it has written to the Excise Commissioner requesting him to raid the establishment where the incident took place and find out how liquor was being sold when no licence had been issued for that purpose. SLTDA has also launched a separate investigation into the operation of the establishment.
Four suspects were arrested and remanded by the Weligama Police on Friday April 13 and two others on the 15th following the recording of statements from several witnesses. The area OIC had also been transferred while investigations are progressing and more arrests will be made.
The Tourist Police is actively involved in the investigation and is assisting the Weligama Police by facilitating contact with the victims, some of whom have left the island. Meanwhile the Ministry of Tourism Development had also summoned a meeting with key police officials in order to strengthen security in tourist hot spots and introduce safeguards to prevent such incidents.
The Tourism Minister called on the police to strengthen its Tourist Police Division as soon as possible and to set up permanent posts at all tourist hot spots. In the interim he also requested to consider deploying the STF in troublesome areas such as Mirissa.
