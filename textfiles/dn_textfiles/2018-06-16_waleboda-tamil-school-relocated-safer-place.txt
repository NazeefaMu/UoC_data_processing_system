Waleboda Tamil School relocated at safer place

The Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council (SPC) relocated the Waleboda Tamil School at a safe place of no landslide or natural disasters .
The Waleboda Tamil School of Balangoda has been under landslide threat for 10 years. The newly constructed school was commissioned by Sabaragamuwa Governor Niluka Ekanayake recently.
Principal S. Sathyaraj said landslides affected the school for several occasions during the last 10 years. The school was close on rainy days since landslides. Line houses near the school were removed and relocated but no action was taken to relocate the school, the principal said.
Now the school was relocated on a two-acre land offered by the Balangoda Plantation Limited. The SPC has allocated Rs. 18 million to construct new buildings. More facilities will be provided in future, provincial sources said.
