Preamble to sustainable development

The adoption by the United Nations in 1986 of the Declaration on the Right to Development ("the Declaration") was the culmination of a long process of international campaigning for human rights. From the beginning, the idea of human rights as an international concern was perceived as an integrated whole consisting of all civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights.
The idea of integrated human rights as an international concern was first declared in the Charter of the United Nations in 1945 and in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 and later in subsequent international instruments. Accordingly unity of all rights - civil and political rights as well as economic, social and cultural rights was recognized. In 1986 UN General Assembly adopted Declaration on the Right to Development which marks the culmination of a long process of international campaigning for right to development which was endorsed by the UN Vienna Declaration in 1993 and the subsequent international instruments.
Human rights set universal standards of achievement and norms of behaviour for all states, civil societies, and the international community and impose inviolable obligations on all of them to make those rights achievable. Recognizing the right to development as a human right raises the status of that right to one with universal applicability and inviolability, it also specifies a norm of action for the people, the institution or the state and international community on which the claim for that right is made.
Content of the right to development
Firstly the right to development refers to a process of development which leads to the realization of each human right and of all of them together and which has to be carried out in a manner known as rights-based, in accordance with the international human rights standards, as a participatory, non-discriminatory, accountable and transparent process with equity in decision-making and sharing of fruits of the process. Equity-which is essential to any notion of human rights derived from the idea of equality of all human beings in rights, dignity and opportunity, and is associated with fairness or the principles of a just society-is basic to that process. Secondly, the objectives of development should be expressed in terms of claims or entitlements of right-holders, which duty-bearers must protect and promote. The identification of the corresponding obligation at the national and the international level is essential to a rights-based approach.
As the Declaration on the Right to Development itself points out, the primary responsibility for implementing the right to development belongs to states. The beneficiaries are individuals. The international community has the duty to corporate to enable the states to fulfill their obligations. Thirdly, to make the right to development a valid, concrete right, the procedures for carrying out the obligations have to be worked out so that the rights can be realized through appropriate social arrangement.
The following sections elaborate on these implications. The content of the right to development can be analyzed on the basis of the text of the Declaration on the Right to Development. Article 1, paragraph 1 of the Declaration states, "The right to development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in, contribute to, and enjoy economic, social, cultural and political development, in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized".
This Article spells out three principles: (a) there is an inalienable human right that is called the right to development; (b) there is a particular process of economic, social, cultural and political development, in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized; and (c) the right to development is a human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in, contribute to and enjoy that particular process of development.
The first principle affirms the right to development as an inalienable human right and, as such, the right cannot be taken or bargained away. The second principle defines a process of development in terms of the realization of "human rights," which are enumerated in the Universal Declaration and other human rights instruments adopted by United Nations and regional bodies. The third principle defines the right to that process of development in terms of claims or entitlements or rights holders, which duty bearers must protect and promote. Development is defined in the preamble of the Declaration of the Right to Development as a comprehensive economic, social, cultural and political process, which aims at the constant improvement of the well-being of the entire population and of all individuals, on the basis of their active, free and meaningful participation in development and in the fair distribution of benefits resulting there from".
The process of development that is recognized as a human right is the one, in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized", consequent to the constant improvement of well being that is the objective of development. Article 8 states more specifically that in taking steps to realize the right to development, states shall ensure "equality of opportunity for all in their access to basic resources, education, health services, food, housing employment and the fair distribution of income", and take effective measures to ensure "that women have an active role in the development process", as well as carrying out "appropriate economic and social reforms with a view to eradicating all social injustices".
The right to development as the right to a process of development
Several articles in the Declaration elaborate the point that the right claimed as a human right is the right to a particular process of development. A closer analysis of these articles reveals a number of important features of that process. A country, it may be noted, can develop by many different processes. There may be a sharp increase in gross domestic product (GDP) with the "richer groups", which have greater access to financial and human capital, becoming increasingly prosperous, and the "poorer sections" lagging behind, if not remaining deprived.
Dr. Amartya Sen on human development
The nature of this process of development is centred around the concept of equity and justice, with the majority of the population, who are currently poor and deprived, having their living standards raised and capacity to improve their position strengthened, leading to the improvement of the well-being of the entire population. On the face of it, this approach is substantially different from the usual approach to economic development, preoccupied with the growth of output of material products and marketable services.
This development process has to be participatory. The new paradigm of development thinking was also introduced in the human development approach, as built up by the Human Development Reports of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and as articulated by Dr. Amartya Sen in his writings on development.
Duties and obligations
For the realization of any right the assignment of duties must be carried out so as to establish accountability. Article 2, paragraph 2 of the Declaration stipulates that all human beings, individually and collectively have a responsibility for securing the right to development, "as well as their duties to the community" with full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. States, according to Article 3 have "the primary responsibility for the creation of national and international conditions favourable to the realization of the right to development. At the national level, in Article 2, paragraph 3 it is pointed out that "States have the right and the duty to formulate appropriate national development policies". According to Article 8, "States should undertake, at the national level, all necessary measures for the realization of the right to development", and "should encourage popular participation in all spheres". In addition, in Article 6, states are required to take steps "to eliminate obstacles to development resulting from failure to observe civil and political rights as well as economic, social and cultural rights", because the implementation, promotion and protection of those rights would be essential for realizing the right to development.
Environmental justice
It must be stressed that the right to development whatever it may mean-is not unlimited. It cannot be said that individuals of states - as contended in the Declaration - have the right to develop in any manner they wish. The right to development - if such a right indeed exists under international law and many believe that it does not - must take place with due regard to other accepted rights and within the framework of international law itself, of which environmental protection is an important component.
In other words, the debate on environmental protection must be reconciled with the debate on the right to development and, in the opinion of the author; the concept of sustainable development provides the answer. The Rio Declaration of 1992 also refers to the right to sustainable development which seeks to bridge the gap between environmental protection and economic development. In other words, the Rio Declaration makes it clear that the right to development is not unlimited and must be pursued within the framework of sustainable development.
This is an important development as it seeks to remedy the lacuna in the UN Declaration on Right to Development wherein no reference was made to environmental protection.
