Student clash shuts Ampara Hardy Technical College

Hardy Advanced Technological Institute in Ampara was temporarily shut down yesterday following a clash between two student groups.
Following the clash, a group of students had barricaded the Hardy College Director’s office for several hours preventing him from leaving, which later prompted authorities to temporarily close the institution, our correspondents in the area said.
Several students injured during the clash had been admitted to hospital and also the Police had taken into custody several others over the clash.
The clash had reportedly occurred between resident students and non-resident students at the institution.
The Police had been called by the management of the institution and they had reportedly intervened to disperse students involved in the clash and rescue the Director.
