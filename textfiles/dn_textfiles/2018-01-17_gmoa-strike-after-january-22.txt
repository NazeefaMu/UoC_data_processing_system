GMOA to strike after January 22

The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) will resort to an island-wide strike after January 22, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the strike will be carried out without a prior notice. The President and the Health Ministry were already informed about the union action, he said.
Dr. Aluthge said the responsibilities for the hardships that the public would undergo due to the strike should be borne by the politicians who lied to the people, cheated them and the health officials who try to take revenge from doctors.
The GMOA has put forward nine demands to the Government and the Health Ministry. Keeping the promises made by the Government to resolve the SAITM issue by abolishing it on December 31 last year, and issues relating to their salary and allowances were among them, he said.
