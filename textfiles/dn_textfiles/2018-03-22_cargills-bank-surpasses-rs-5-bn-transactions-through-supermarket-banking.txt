Excerpts of an interview
Q. Can you give us an introduction to, Cargills Cash?
A. Cargills Cash is a mobile based solution implemented for our customers providing them with four basic banking functions through the Cargills Food City (CFC) network. With Cargills Bank, banking is now made easy as downloading an app on your mobile device.
The services offered through Cargills Cash include deposits, withdrawals and purchases from any Cargills Food City outlet where customers can pay through this service and transfer cash enabling a user to send cash to any person in Sri Lanka with a valid Identity Card and a mobile phone.
Q. What made Cargills Bank to initiate this service to its customers?
A. In line to our core objective ‘banking on the human spirit’, this mobile platform was implemented with a vision of banking with a different approach to reach our customers. Our biggest strength is the tie up with the Cargills Food City (CFC) network.
This tie up with CFC and the Bank gives a unique approach to convenience.
It is an unmatched proposition in the market. Apart from these facilities the mobile banking platform has all other functionalities which a normal bank does, from fund transfers to the payment of utility bills.
Q. To whom does this service cater to and how has it made life convenient for regular shoppers?
A. Cargills Bank has been at the forefront of offering timely and user-oriented banking products since we entered the banking sector.

We invite our customers to enjoy the convenience of this platform provided within the CFC group.
Q. Can you explain how secure these transactions are?
A. As a bank our core objective is to ensure that not only the transactions are very secure but our customers also feel secured.
After much research and analysis the Cargills Cash app was developed to be the most secured platform that a customer could use.
Cargills Bankhas enabled IBM's cognitive cyber security solutions to enhance existing cyber defensive capabilities. We have also enabled improved monitoring systems while implementing stronger preventive protocols against sophisticated incidents. Transactions are secured by two factor authentications, enabling the customer to engage in verified transactions through their mobile devices. The exceptional feature of this service is its accessibility, as a customer can walk into any Cargills Food City outlet across the country, to attend to their banking needs on extended hours and 365-day day basis.

By tying up with our services, they have been able to offer increased convenience to their consumers.
Q. In looking back what do you believe was the reason behind the success of this product?
A. The bond between Cargills Bank and the Cargills Food City network has immensely helped us to achieve this record breaking milestone.
The commitment from the teams engaged from both sides was immense especially from the front-liners, who provided value added services to engage our customers with this product. There are also many teams working in technical, marketing and operational areas to ensure the success of this product. Therefore, as I mentioned earlier it is a team effort which delivered this unique proposition in to the market.
Meanwhile Cargills Food City is undergoing a rapid expansion drive. Any new Cargills Food City outlet coming up will be enabled with these new services. As the Cargills Food City network expands Cargills banking services will also reach customers across every corner of the island.
