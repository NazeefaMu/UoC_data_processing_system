Judge orders lowering kovil volume, admonishes priest

Jaffna High Court Judge M.Ilancheliyan had ordered to lower the sound of the loudspeaker of the Nayanmarkandu Kovil in Jaffna.
He admonished the kovil priest in court saying “Gods hear better than humans”. Several citizens of the city had filed a petition three weeks back against the kovil for its high levels of volume which disturbs the day to day activities of nearby citizens.
The petition states that students and patients of the nearby schools and hospitals suffer from the kovil loudspeaker's high volume.
The judge then ordered the Kovil priest to lower the volume and the ‘Grama Sevaka’was advised to produce a report on the outcome.The report stated that the volume hasn’t been lowered as advised by court. Another petition was filed by the citizens and the kovil priest was summoned before the judge.
When inquired, the priest had stated that the Gods prefer loud volumes to which the judge had replied that Gods hear better than humans and to lower the volumes of the loudspeakers.The judge had also warned the priest stating that ‘Pooja’s should be offered without distracting the citizens in their day to day activities.
