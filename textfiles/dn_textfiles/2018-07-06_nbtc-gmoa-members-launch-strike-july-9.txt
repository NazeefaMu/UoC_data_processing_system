NBTC GMOA members to launch strike from July 9

Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) members attached to the National Blood Transfusion Centre (NBTC) will launch a strike from next Monday (9), GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the strike will be launched in protest of the conduct of the Blood Bank Acting Director and not taking action by the Health Ministry Secretary to remove him from the post with immediate effect. The strike will be extended to all sections of the Blood Transfusion Service island-wide if the Health Ministry Secretary does not take action to resolve the issue. The strike will affect blood donation leading to a blood shortage. Initially, GMOA member doctors of the Blood Bank will strike and thereafter the strike will be extended to blood supply to the private hospitals and dialysis units.
Dr. Aluthge said the Acting Director is violating the Establishment Code and tarnishing the reputation of the other doctors attached to the National Blood Transfusion Service. “He does his best to tarnish the confidence of the public on the Blood Bank and provide inaccurate information to the media. He does all those things using invisible power bestowed on him by the Health Minister.” he said.
