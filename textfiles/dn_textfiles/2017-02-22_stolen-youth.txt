Stolen youth

A young girl smiles in the mirror. She can see her glowing fresh skin, neat lips and youthful eyes. Thick black hair falling up to her shoulders. The very feature that she adored, the treasure which she guarded amidst cruel resistance. She struggled to protect it from the ones who wanted it to be cut; the ones who believed that the womanly beauty she was innocently proud of should be crushed to pieces, revealing the creature that ‘they’ wanted to exhibit in ‘their’ world.
A gloomy day dawned. The sky was heavy with pregnant clouds, about to deliver the drops of rain. They took the scissors. The creaking of the scissor blades was deafening, not just her ears, but her very soul. They cut it. They cut it short as they wished. She cried. She wept. She griped. But the cutting didn’t stop. She could see the black flocks of hair falling at her feet.
She stopped weeping. The tears dried. But the heart became heavy, very heavy. A burden that she would carry ever.
She saw herself in the mirror. Tears streamed in and started to crawl down her cheeks.
