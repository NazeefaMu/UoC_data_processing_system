CIMA signs with Omentra.com to implement digital corporate ticketing

Sri Lanka’s pioneer online procurement service provider Omentra.com, continues to innovate their digital procurement solutions to drive better strategies for suppliers in various disciplines.
Their latest offering includes providing professional bodies, event management companies and even corporates who hold various events, the ability to host their events online.
The platform provides attendees the ease of reserving, registering and purchasing tickets online, after which they would receive reminders and notifications about the event.
Nadun Kumara, Head of Operations, Omentra.com said, “We believe that procurement should enable and support organizations to implement and drive new ways of sourcing, that in turn will help them achieve a lucrative level of sales for each activity.
We wanted to create a good engagement threshold that delivered a simplified process for organizations to manage and market their events in a cost effective and time efficient manner that also had 24/7 availability and accessibility.”
“Our solution is designed to cater for events of all sizes, with tools that enable everything that is required to manage all aspects of ticket sales. It helps to automate many time-consuming tasks that are generally done manually from selling tickets, sending reminder messages, cancellations to payments and collections. It’s fully customized to include a customer’s own branding, images and text, eliminating the need for suppliers to invest a large sum of money into designing. Additionally, the solution also ensures that customers’ private information such as credit card or bank account data is secure and has the necessary security measures in place. Therefore not only is the solution flexible and safe, but it’s also cost effective, whilst being convenient for ticket buyers.”
Taking the lead in being the first professional accounting body to use this service, the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) recently signed an MoU with Omentra.com to market their key events to their students as well as non-members. Along with selling tickets online, CIMA will also be able to track ticket sales easily and instantly as well as customize their event tickets into various categories as per their price, attendee types, and so on.
Zahara Ansary, Country Manager for CIMA Sri Lanka, speaking about their aim of using the solution said, “CIMA is excited to partner with Omentra.com to enable seamless access to our events. We are proud to be the first professional body to tie up with Omentra.com, providing the various corporates easy access in purchasing tickets to our flagship event Business Leaders’ Summit and the various other Continuous Professional Development (CPD) events we organize. In order to ensure our members stay relevant in their continuing professional journey in these times of rapid technological changes, we have several new CPD events such as Demystifying Crypto Currencies, Investing in Digital Currency and Cyber Security related programs lined up for 2018. These are in addition to the usual programs that we run which help our members and non-members alike such as Excel Analytics, ERP, Personal Branding, Project Management and Speech craft. We look forward to making these available via Omentra.com to the Corporates.”
Nadun Kumara said, “The process of purchasing tickets through a well-developed system that creates convenience for our users was the key to us launching this solution. We are happy that a leading global professional accounting body such as CIMA has been the first to partner with us in using this solution. I believe it speaks volumes of the need that existed in the market as well as the value we offer. Since day one, we've been passionate about creating cutting-edge solutions backed by exceptional service and support and we will continue to innovate our solution to keep offering suppliers real, measurable results for all their procurement needs.”
