Govt. slinging mud at opponents to cover up political bankruptcy: MR

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday said that the government is more committed in the principle of silencing the voice of its opponents by imprisoning them.
“The present government wants to harass their opponents and sling mud at them to cover up their political bankruptcy,” he said.
The former President was speaking to the media after visiting UPFA parliamentarian Udaya Gammanpila and National Freedom Front spokesman A.J. M. Muzzammil at the Magazine Prisons in Colombo.
Rajapaksa said politicians can be imprisoned but their ideology can not be suppressed.
