Get your stress  out with a laugh

YWCA of Sri Lanka is a pioneer as early as 1882 in creating safe spaces for young women embarking on educational and professional pursuits away from their sheltered lifestyles. The women’s facilities at the National YWCA Headquarters in Rotunda Gardens Colombo 3 was initiated to provide various facilities for aspiring young women in the 1970’s at subsidized rates.
The present estimates of women of all ethnicities, religions, and economic strata who have walked through YWCA Hostel portals are over several thousands, while the demand for young women’s safety is still significantly high. Between then and now the Hostel capacities have outgrown the increasing demands. Maintenance and refurbishment have become urgent. It is in keeping the vision of safe spaces for young women that we have organized a fund raiser to renovate and scale up facilities.
The fund raiser, Wilson Gunaratne’s famous play Charitha Atak, will be staged on September 8 at the Bishop’s College Auditorium at 6.30pm, where the main actor will portray eight different characters, which is how the play gets its name, ‘Charitha Atak’. Tickets for the show are available at the National YWCA of Sri Lanka and the Bishop’s College Auditorium.
The headquarters of the YWCA of Sri Lanka is located in Colombo in the heart of the city, with easy access to most Universities, Colleges, Businesses and Government Offices. The land was gifted to the YWCA by Iranganie Peiris and the building was erected in 1976. The National YWCA building which is 45 years old comprises of three stories and houses the Office of the National YWCA, a “Peace Room” (for prayer and meditation), a “Safe Space for Women’’ (offers services to those in need of guidance in combating violence against women and HIV/AIDS), a Cafeteria and Kitchen, Hall and Board room, Hostel, and rooms for transient guests.
The hostel facilities in the original building were for only 75 students. Due to the demand for safe and affordable accommodation, the hostel now has a total of 170 hostellers. With this comes the need to repair and refurbish the 45 year old building.
Further, the building was designed by the renowned Architect Geoffrey Bawa. Therefore, it is of great architectural and historical value, enhancing the need for its refurbishment and maintenance to preserve its architectural design and historical significance.
The YWCA was initially founded in England in 1855 by Emma Roberts and Mary Jane Kinnaird and has its roots in a prayer group for women. Soon the Association established its first hostel for young women going out into the world and the first female training institution was founded shortly thereafter. The Colombo YWCA was born when Emily Kinnaird visited Ceylon in 1882 and met a group of women with similar aspirations. YWCAs were soon formed in other major Ceylonese cities such as Kandy, Galle, Panadura and Jaffna.
The National YWCA of Sri Lanka is affiliated to the World YWCA in Geneva, Switzerland, is the mother organization of 22 local Associations spread throughout the country. The YWCA, by its very constitution, recognises the equal value and inclusivity in God’s eyes, of all human beings without distinction of any kind and more particularly advocates against discrimination on the grounds of race, religion, language, gender, political opinion and so on.
