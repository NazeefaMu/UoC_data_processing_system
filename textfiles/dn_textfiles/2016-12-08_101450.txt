Jayampathy complains of death threat

UNP MP and Constitutional Expert Dr. Jayampathi Wickramaratne told Parliament yesterday that he had received death threats over the phone demanding to stay out of the constitution making process. He made this revelation raising a privilege issue with the permission of Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala. The MP said that he received an anonymous call on Tuesday demanding that he withdraw from the constitution making activities or be prepared to face death. The unknown caller had threatened to kill the MP and his family members.
Wickramaratne said that he lodged a complaint in this regard with the Welikada Police. He requested the Chair to hold a separate investigation with regard to this incident.
“I commenced my politics with the Lanka Sama Samaja Party and will not give in to threats from anonymous callers. I will not resign from the constitution making process which is of utmost importance to the nation,” he said.
The Deputy Speaker said he would order the IGP to conduct a formal investigation into the incident.
He also referred the matter to the Privileges Committee. The Deputy Speaker assured that he would take maximum possible action against the threats to the life of MP Wickramaratne.
