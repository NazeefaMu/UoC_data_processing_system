SL Tourism targets over 4.5 million tourists by 2020

Existing economic development and peace in the country will largely benefit Sri Lanka to target over 4.5 million foreign tourist arrivals by 2020.
Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Minister John Amaratunga made these remarks at the official opening of the newly constructed Jie Jie Beach by Jetwing Hotels in Panadura.
The hotel's project investor Jie Zhong Jie, Lanka Development Construction and Engineering (Pvt) Ltd Chairman Li Jian Guo and Jetwing Group Chairman Hiran Cooray were also present.
The modern three-storied Jie Jie Beach by Jetwing, constructed at a cost of US$ 20 million, is owned by Jie Zhong Jie and Lanka Development Construction and Engineering, while the hotel is managed by Jetwing Hotels.
Addressing the gathering, Minister Amaratunga said that at a time when the country’s tourism industry was reaping fruitful results due to the arrival of large number of tourists, Sri Lanka Tourism has planned to develop the sector by helping local and foreign investors to construct more and more hotels in every part of the country.
“Like the newly constructed Jie Jie Beach by Jetwing, Panadura, we also urge other foreign investors to visit this beautiful island and construct many more hotel complexes considering the arrival of an unprecedented number of foreign tourists to the country at present,” he said.
Quoting statistics, Minister Amaratunga said over 2.5 million foreign tourists arrived in the county last year and during the past few months of this year over 2.3 million tourists have arrived so far. He said these statistics reflect that the country can expect over 4.5 million foreign tourists by 2020 and to achieve this target the Government is now planning to construct more hotels with the help of local and foreign investors.
