Sudarshani at variance with Faiszer on amendment

State Minister Dr Sudarshani Fernandopulle yesterday registered her strong opposition to the proposed Amendment to Local Authorities Elections Ordinance to bring down the first-past-the-post representation to 60 percent.
Her resistance came immediately after Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha told the media at the SLFP Headquarters in Colombo that the said Amendment would be presented to Parliament next week.
Fernandopulle, who addressed the same press conference, pointed out the new Amendment would lead to a reduction of female representation in LG bodies.
“As the leader of SLFP Women’s Front I strongly urge Minister Musthapha not to present this Amendment to Parliament. If presented, I will use my vote against the Bill.
The women will be denied of 25 percent quota if this Amendment is adopted,” Fernandopulle insisted.
Minister Musthapha reacting to her comments maintained that the problem could be resolved through negotiation.
“I respect her views. We will consider them. Hopefully we will be able to reach a common ground,” the minister responded.
