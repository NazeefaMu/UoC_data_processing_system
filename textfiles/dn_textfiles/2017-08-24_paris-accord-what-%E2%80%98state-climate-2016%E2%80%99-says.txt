Paris Accord - What ‘State of the Climate 2016’ says

State of the Climate – 2016 (SOC-16) is a 298-page document published by American Meteorological Society.  It is based on contributions from about 500 scientists from 60 countries – unfortunately none from Sri Lanka – and thousands of data sets.  It was released on line on August 08, 2017 giving valuable information on how forty climate variables have changed during 2016.  I have been studying this since 2010 and waiting for 2016 report to check validity of some arguments I have been advocating since of late.
Current day climate change theories are based on following hypotheses.
(1) Although water vapour is the most influential greenhouse gas in atmosphere, any new water vapour entering atmosphere will not increase the greenhouse effect of atmosphere as it would condense in a few weeks.
(2) CO2 and other greenhouse gases (primary stimulants) entering atmosphere anew spend more time in atmosphere and increase the greenhouse effect of atmosphere and water vapour (secondary stimulant) entering atmosphere to maintain constant relative humidity at the elevated temperature (first temperature increase due to primary stimulants) would stay there and exert an additional greenhouse effect and further increase temperature (second temperature increase due to secondary stimulant).
But these theories are silent about the Newly Formed Water (NFW) vapour arising from combustion of oil and gas containing about 2 and 4 atoms respectively of hydrogen for each atom of carbon (Table 8.1 in Sustainable Energy by Prof. Jefferson Tester, et al). I call this Newly Formed Water because this was not available as water in the global Water cycle earlier. Even the IGSM 2 Model put out by the MIT Joint Programme on Science and Policy of Global Change has not included NFW in its stream from Human System to Earth System. One important aspect of this NFW is that it enters the atmosphere along with CO2 from the same oil and gas combustion and hence will remain behind in the atmosphere.
If you look at, as per climate scientists, doubling of CO2 concentration from 280ppm to 560 ppm, primary stimulant increases temperature by 1.20C and the secondary stimulant by another 1.60C totaling up to the well-known 2.80C increase. My contention with NFW is that NFW acts as a primary stimulant, bringing in a secondary stimulant stream resulting in two sets of temperature increases only.
In 2015, we have generated 43000 TWhrs from coal, 50000 TWhrs from oil and 36000 TWhrs from gas and corresponding outcomes from these along the above line of thought are given below. This is about 4% drop from 2011 for coal, 11% increase for oil and 33% increase for gas resulting in8.0% increase in CO2, 21% increase in NFW to meet 9.6% increase in total energy from fossil fuels. A 21% increase in NFW to achieve a 1.6% decrease in CO2.
State of the Climate – 2016 explained on this basis
We intend to explain some of the 33 parameters mentioned in page S2using this NFW hypothesis. This will help readers to assess NFW’s contribution towards climate change vis-à-vis CO2 from the same fossil fuels, etc.
(i) Surface temperature
If we look at possible value for temperature increase based on previously mentioned 2.80C due to a 280ppm increase and 3.5ppm CO2 increase in 2011, we would arrive at a figure of 0.0350C. We agree that (a) direct comparisons cannot be made based on ppm levels of CO2 and (b) as CO2 level increases temperature increase for a givenCO2 increase reduces; but current CO2 ppm level is about halfway between 280 and 560 and if at all it differs from 0.0350C, it could only be much less. But SOC 16 says that the temperature increase is around 0.01 – 0.120C above the previous maximum observed in 2015. This is in spite of the 11 year solar cycle crossing the maximum (Note Total Solar Irradiance dropped by 0.10Wm-2 in 2016). This implies that global temperature will indicate a downward trend in the next five, six years as been the case with the second half of the earlier 11 year solar cycles, if oil and gas consumptions do not increase significantly.
NFW approach yields a temperature increase of 0.0680C due to products of combustion from fossil fuels and when other effects from deforestation, highway construction, etc are taken into consideration it may be much more. Once these are adjusted for their reduced sensitivities to increases in greenhouse gas concentrations, we would arrive at a temperature closer to the observed values.
(ii) Extreme warm days
This graph depicts that in 2016 we have experienced about 18% extremely warm days above 1961-1990 level and these drought conditions were of unusually long durations. Both these extreme phenomena could be more easily explained using NFW than with only CO2.
NFW approach implies there is more water vapour in atmosphere than with only CO2 approach, and normal seasonal changes may not be able to bring temperature down adequately due to this water vapour to condense all the water vapour and bring drought to a close. Anyhow with temperatures coming down more with solar cycle effect, droughts in next few years will be comparatively shorter; unless of course a lot more oil & gas is used to replace coal.
(iii) Precipitation
Precipitation increased by about 20mm (or was it 40 mm) during 2016 in a setup which also experienced a temperature increase of 0.01-0.120C.
When somebody consumes 1 litre (0.8 kg) of gasoline in a vehicle, s/he also generates 1.03kg or 1 litre of NFW (secondary school level Chemistry) in addition to which another three litres of water is brought into the atmosphere to maintain constant relative humidity. This implies that at least 25% of precipitation from oil & gas is due to NFW and this would be true even if this NFW condenses only after a short residence time of a few weeks as suggested by current beliefs. And this also should mean that there will be continuous rain and the mere fact that this is not how we experience precipitation implies that there is spatial and temporal accumulation of NFW in the atmosphere. With the 11-year solar cycle entering its downward half of the cycle, we should expect more precipitation in coming few years which should remind of precipitation and floods in 2010-11.
(iv) Humidity
Relative humidity of the land area has remained within ± 1.5% level while that above the oceans has remained within even a lesser range. So the assumption about constant relative humidity had been valid. Humidity has increased by around 1% during the year. { total column water vapour has increased by about 0.25mm from the average value of 25mm}. If we assume that additional water vapour has come into atmosphere only to maintain constant relative humidity corresponding to 0.0350C resulting from CO2 based temperature increase computations, the increase in humidity should have been only 0.245%.
(v) Land wind speed & tropical cyclones
This again has been increasing during 2016 and even here NFW would influence the increase more than CO2. If you look at viscosities of O2 (the gas NFW replaces in atmosphere on a 8:9 basis), N2, CO2 and NFW they are in the ratio 25: 22: 19 : 13. The SOC – 16 also says there had been 93 named tropical cyclones in 2016 and if you look at the 6 reasons which would prompt formation of a cyclone, 5 of them are instigated by NFW and sixth is a latitude related reason.
(vi) Radiation Budget at the Top of the Atmosphere
SOC Reportsalso show how Radiation Budgets at Top of Atmosphere has changed in that year. I was following this since 2010 and the corresponding changes since thenare given below
Budget Changes since 2010
When Kiehl & Trentberth published their original Mean Energy Budget Diagram (shown below) they made three statements given below. These are important in understanding the Diagram and interpreting the SOC – 16 section on this Radiation Budget.
(a) 78 Wm-2 stream due to evapo-transpiration has been calculated as the latent heat due to 1000mm of annual rainfall.
(b) 24Wm-2Thermals flow from the earth is calculated by carrying out an energy balance
(c) In some years the oceans might absorb a certain amount of heat to balance the system.
These changes show that TSI has recorded a negative change for the first time (during last seven years) in 2016. If one looks at normal solar cycles in the past, they generally involve a TSI increase of about 0.5Wm-2 in about 5-6 years; since the cycle has displayed a minimum in 2006, there seems to be an abnormality in this process. Reduction of 0.10Wm-2 in 2016 may be indication that the solar cycle has passed the maximum point. It may also indicate that we should expect increased precipitation in the next few years.
In SOC – 2015 document it was mentioned that the interannual variabilitiesare±50, ±0.20 and ±0.40 Wm-2 respectively for OLR, TSI and RSW. If we use these figures for the changes in these three flow rates, the only flow rate which has shown a variation outside these limits is RSW which has shown two positive changes and one negative change. The increase in RSW in 2012 – 2013 could be due to the increase in surface albedo during the period and the increase in 2009-2010 had been in spite of a decrease in surface albedo. This could be due to increase in cloud formation related to enhanced precipitation experienced in Thailand, Australia etc. Only product of combustion of fossil fuels which could influence RSW both positively and negatively is NFW which could increase RSW due to cloud formation and reduce RSW due to phenomenon like atmospheric rivers.
Coming to the OLR, the parameter has not shown a significant variation according to SOC- 2015. SOC – 16 says that the increase in OLR is due to El Nino effect. This increase could also be due to increased precipitation of 20 mm and if we use the same logic as in original Kiehl and Trentberth Diagram increased precipitation could result in an increase of 1.5Wm-2 in OLR.
An overall comment
We have looked at some parameters indicated in SOC-16 and have found that variations in a larger number of parameters could be explained using NFW formed by the combustion of fossil fuels like oil and gas. This ever-increasing consumption of oil & gas will lead to a future where we would be unable to control the ever increasing precipitation leading to many a flood associated with landslides. We in Sri Lanka lost more than 300 lives during the floods in earlier part of this year and India and Nepal are experiencing greater floods killing more than 500 and affecting millions right at the moment. We mentioned about USA’s experiences in 2016 earlier. September 2nd2013 issue of Fortune magazine carried 17 photographs of flood affected scenes from different countries showing clearly that precipitation related disasters will not spare any country due to its level of sophistication nor its awareness of climate change aspects.
The Solution
The most appropriate solution for these disasters will obviously be one which would reduce usage of fossil fuels oil & gas and at the same time favourably influence changes in above mentioned energy flows crossing Top of Atmosphere. For the luck of Mankind, there is one solution which fulfils these requirements.
We call this solution Highway Solarisation which means“A dedicated infrastructure for generating electricity for supply to the main grid and/or powering battery electric vehicles using solar energy collected by PV solar panels installed along and above the highways as a solution for climate change”
It will definitely reduce CO2, NFW and waste heat from gas and oil combustion
Then there is the case of RSW and land surface albedo. One phenomenon which reduces RSW and land surface albedo is the construction of highways which basically involves reduction in vegetation followed by laying a tarred surface on top of that. Highway solarisation will reduce this and for every kWhr of energy generated and provided to the main grid or a battery electric vehicle, it will also eliminate 1.4 kWhrs of absorbed solar energy leading to global warming.
If our explanation of OLR increase is right, use of Highway Solarisation to generate energy eliminating use of oil/gas will reduce generation of NFW and hence the latent heat. This will influence the OLR favourably. Right now TSI is in a downward trend and if we establish enough projects based on Highway Solarisation during the next five /six years, we could establish more and more projects when the upward trend in TSI sets in, and reduce the impact of increasing TSI on our energy budget.
Conclusion
We have interpreted the findings in the latest State of the Climate – 2016 document using a new approach which considers Newly Formed Water (NFW) due to hydrogen present in oil and gas and found out that these explanations provide more plausible interpretations. We have also explained changes in energy flow rates crossing Top of Atmosphere. We have also outlined a solution to generate energy without generating both CO2 and NFW and explained how this solution will reduce the impact of changes in these energy flow rates on Global Energy System.
We are happy that President Donald Trump brought the Paris Accord – enhancing usage of gas to reduce CO2 emissions from coal - to the limelight giving us an opportunity to relook at it. As one could see from the figures given above that would have resulted in bringing more NFW into the atmosphere and this NFW would have (i) increased temperature further when in the air, (ii) created enormous havoc in the form of cyclones, hurricanes while coming down and (iii)created flooding, landslides, etc. when on the ground.
Anybody implementing Paris Accord; yes, we are also building a Noah’s Ark.
