ICC U19 Cricket World Cup
Australia ends Afghans push towards final

All-rounders Jack Edwards and Jonathan Merlo came up with determined performances as Australia kept themselves in line for a fourth title by registering a comfortable six-wicket victory over Afghanistan in the first Super League semi-finals of the ICC U19 Cricket World Cup.
Edwards slammed a brisk knock of 72 (65b, 8x4, 2x6) as Australia coasted to 182 for four in 37.3 overs after Merlo’s four for 24 had helped bowl out Afghanistan for 181 in 48 overs to end the Asian champions’ title aspirations in a match played in front of broadcast cameras at the Hagley Oval in Christchurch.
Australia await the winners of the second semi-final between three-time champions India and two-time winners Pakistan at the same venue on Tuesday to see who they get to play in the 3 February day-night final in Tauranga.
Afghanistan will play the losers of Tuesday’s match in the third-fourth position match on 1 February at the John Davies Oval in Queenstown.
