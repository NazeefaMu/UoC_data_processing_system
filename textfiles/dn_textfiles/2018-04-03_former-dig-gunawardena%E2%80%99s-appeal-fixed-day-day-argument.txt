Former DIG Gunawardena’s appeal fixed for day-to-day argument

The appeal petition filed by former DIG Vaas Gunawardena, his son Ravindu Vaas Gunawardena and four police officers challenging the Colombo High Court's judgement to convict them for committing the murder of millionaire businessman Mohamed Shyam, was yesterday fixed for argument by the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court three-judge-bench, comprising Justices Sisira de Abrew, Justice Vijith Malalgoda and Justice L. T. B. Dehideniya, fixed the matter for argument to be taken up on a day-to-day basis from September 25.
Former DIG Vaas Gunawardena, his son Ravindu Vaas Gunawardena and four police officers were sentenced to death by the Colombo High Court Trial-at-Bar Bench for committing the murder of millionaire businessman Mohamed Shyam in 2013 in the Dompe area. This appeal is to be heard before a five-judge-bench of the Supreme Court on the next date.
The accused, who were ordered to be sentenced to death were, former DIG Vaas Gunawardena and his son Ravindu Vaas Gunawardena, Sub Inspector Indika Bamunuge, Police Constable (PC) Gamini Sarath Chandra, PC Priyanka Sanjeewa and PC Kelum Ranga. Through their appeal, the six accused-appellants stated that they were seeking the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to review and set aside their conviction and the death sentence imposed by the High Court.
President's Counsel Gamini Marapana with Anil Silva PC, Anuja Premaratne PC and Counsel Asitha Vipulanayake appeared for the accused-appellants.
Additional Solicitor General Ayesha Jinasena appeared for the Attorney General.
