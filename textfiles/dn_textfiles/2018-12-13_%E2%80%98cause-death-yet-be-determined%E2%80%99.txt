Elephant carcass found in Janaranjana wewa:
‘Cause of death yet to be determined’

The cause of death of an elephant found dead recently in a bed of water hyacinth in the Janaranjana wewa in Suriyapura, has not yet been confirmed, Wildlife Conservation Department officials said.
Officials said since the carcass of the elephant had not been removed from the tank, a postmortem was yet to be held. They said they were unable to drag the carcass ashore as the water level in the tank had risen.
Officials added that it had finally been decided by a group of Wildlife officers led by Veterinary Surgeon Sameera Kalinga Arachchi, to remove the carcass using a backhoe and commence the investigation.
Wildlife officers said that they observed a wound on the face of the animal.
They also said that a few farmers in the locality had seen the elephant lingering in the area.
It had trouble walking as well, they added.
