Under my shade

[Short story]
The leaves were not waving or dancing, but wrestling. How boisterous and rowdy the sound was! It was not a soothing sound for the ears; they were fierce, harsh chords of music. The withered and the dead brown leaves rocketed, not knowing where they were bound to. Some plummeted like parachutes. Some flew like aeroplanes. They were scattered all over the ground. Little birds found it difficult to fly straight. They were being taken out of their route by the gushing wind. It was a sudden rough wind that came from nowhere. I was watching the sudden change.
I am a living thing, people say. But I have no feet to move. I was stuck to the ground. I have been here for years and years watching the changes taking place around me. A long time ago I watched the villagers walking on the narrow gravel road carrying things on their heads or if they were too big, in small push carts. At times push-bikes too helped with the carrying. These bicycles had a small luggage unit fixed at the back. As the gravel road became wider, they carried their goods in carts drawn by bulls which gave the roads a new name - ‘cart road’. Now they are wide enough for their goods to be transported in lorries. How much the present environment has changed from the one I encountered years ago!
I still remember the day, long, long ago; when someone from the village looked at me and said that I have a kind of a lustre which the others of my species did not possess. I was very young then. He showed me to the other villagers too. Then they cleaned the place around me and started offering flowers at my foot. Gradually I gained special attention from the villagers. They started believing that a deity had made his palace abode on me. People not only from this village but also from the neighbouring villages started visiting me. They offered flowers, and then lighting oil lamps at my foot, knelt down and worshipped me. Later when they built a shrine under my shade the number of visitors too increased. This was how this ‘devale’ came up, little by little. Sometimes they appealed for my help in finding a lost cow or finding suitable husbands for their daughters and so on.
With the development of their life style, they too became more fashionable. Yet, their faith and trust in me did not diminish much. In fact, I sometimes feel that it increased instead of diminishing. The only difference was that their appeals became rather commercialised. After all, it had to be, hadn’t it? The society has changed and so were their interests.
I was just contemplating my past when I saw a big commotion taking place in the village, not far away from where I was.
“Fire! Fire!,” they were shouting. “Martin’s house is on fire!”
Not only men and women but also the dogs, faster than even men, were running towards Martin’s house. All were in a hurry. Some people were carrying buckets too, may be to help in throwing water to control the fire. Some women were still in their night clothes. Some were carrying their little ones, still naked – may be they had no time to find some garment to cover their nakedness. In such a hurry they were!
I saw the rising smoke. May be the sudden winds had worsened the fire. From my height, I could see people throwing water on the flames while some men and even women carried water from the wells nearby. They were all as busy as bees. One quality I admired in these villagers was how they all got together and helped each other in a grave situation like this. True that they often found fault with others and carried tales, spreading rumours and gossiping and fighting at the simplest provocation. But when in a situation like this they forget everything else and get together.
Soon it became quieter and they all walked back leisurely talking about the fire as if they had been eye witnesses to everything. How funny! But that is village life. Only the dogs were still running back. ‘Dogs hardly walk slowly, they always run’ – it is said.
There were many conclusions, as they say, to this fire. I heard them say, Martin was going to put up a new grocery. Solomon who already had a grocery close by did not like anyone else opening another one. So he had taken the sudden winds as an excuse to set fire to the shed Martin had built up a few days ago. This shed was a small one made up of planks and it had a thatched roof - things that could easily catch fire.
“Solomon is a very jealous man. How can he cheat us and earn profits like this if another boutique comes up?”
“Martin’s daughter is carrying on an affair with Dickson’s son. Dickson is against it. I am sure it is he who had done this.”
“It is good that this happened to Martin. He is inches above the ground now that his daughter has got through the exam.”
These are only what I heard. How many more rumours were there, I did not know.
In the afternoon, Seelawathie, Martin’s wife visited me with Thusitha, her daughter. They had come here to appeal to me to find the culprit. Seelawathie’s sister Karuna joined them and they started talking about the incident.
“Is it true that you were going to open a grocery?” asked Karuna. “I heard that Solomon had set it on fire because of it.”
“We do not know who started this rumour. We never had any idea of doing any business in this village. Our son is going to work in a grocery in the town from next week. But somebody has distorted and twisted this news to form a vicious rumour like that. In fact, Solomon himself told us about it. He was feeling sad and angry too. He said that he was going to visit the devale to curse those who had created this story.”
“Aunty, didn’t you hear any other rumours?” queried Thusitha.
“Haven’t you heard dear that a fence can be built around a country, but not around a mouth?”
“True, Aunty. A jar’s mouth may be stopped: a man’s cannot.”
I was smiling to myself.
The next day, I was surprised to see the mother and daughter visiting me again. They had brought some garlands too to hang on my branches. They seemed to be happy. They worshipped me and thanked me for finding the culprit. That surprised me as I myself did not have any idea as to how the fire broke out, or who the culprit was.
Fortunately, it was a conversation between Thusitha and her friend Amali who was there with me at that time which revealed what had really happened.
“My younger brother had been watching the winds and the leaves flying about,” said Thusitha. “He was so taken up by the scene that he wanted to set fire to a piece of paper and send it flying. It had gone straight on to the thatched roof which at once started going up in flames.”
“What!”
“Yes, Amali. He had seen it catching fire. But he was scared that father would punish him and had kept quiet. Last night he had told my mother.”
“Anyway, it is the Deity on this tree who helped us to find out what happened. We came here last evening and begged Him to find us the culprit. We came here again today too to thank Him,” said Seelawathie.
“Oh!” I said to myself. “It is good if one can help somebody.” I too was feeling happy.
