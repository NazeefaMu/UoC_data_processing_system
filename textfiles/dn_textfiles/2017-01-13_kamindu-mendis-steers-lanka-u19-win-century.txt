Kamindu Mendis  steers Lanka U19  to win with century

The Sri Lankan Under-19 team was off to a good start in their first warm-up match beating Boland Academy by five wickets at Stellenbosch. Sri Lanka chased down the home team’s total of 284-9 by replying with 288 for the loss of five wickets in 49.3 overs.
Kamindu Mendis led the Lankan run chase with a sparkling century – 109 off 118 balls with 15 fours and a one six.
The Sri Lankan lads won the toss and elected to bat first. Thisaru Rashmika was included after both coaches decided to have 12 players each for the match with one player bowling and the other batting. Boland Academy scored 284 runs for the loss of 9 wickets in their 50 overs. Thisaru secured four wickets for 64 runs while Manelker got two wickets.
Captain Avishka Fernando had to retire early as he was hit on the hand while fielding and was unfortunately hit again at the same spot while batting.
Manager of the team Mahinda Halangoda confirmed that Fernando did not sustain any serious injuries or fractures.
“As a precaution we decided to get him to retire. But he should be fine within the next two days. We have three days of practice and the first tournament match starts on Sunday against South Africa followed by Zimbabwe the following day,” he said.
Scores: Boland Academy 284-9 in 50 overs (Z Wilchut 61, L Mtanderi 40, R Coster 100 n.o., R Dilshan 4/64, M de Silva 2/46)
Sri Lanka U19 288-5 in 49.3 overs (V Chaturanga 36, H Boyagoda 52, K Mendis 109, S Ashan 35, A Bandara 27 n.o., M Gebe 3/46)
