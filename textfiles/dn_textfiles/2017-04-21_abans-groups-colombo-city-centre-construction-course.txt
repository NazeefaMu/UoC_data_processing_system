Abans Group's Colombo City Centre construction on course

Influenced by Scandinavian architecture, the Colombo City Centre residences focus on providing an aesthetically-pleasing, neo-classical environment that meets the diverse needs of the 21st century lifestyle.
The spacious interior design of the CCC apartments is devised to help residents de-stress, relax, and unwind. High white ceilings, homogeneous porcelain tile flooring, full glass elevation, and sophisticated colour palettes figure prominently in the space, allowing for a greater intake of natural light and providing the perfect canvas for prospective homeowners to define their living space.
Taking inspiration from the value systems upheld in Sri Lankan society, the apartments will feature a broad open-plan living, dining, and kitchen area where families and guests can gather to spend quality time over dinners, coffee, and numerous other social activities.
The two-kitchen concept namely the wet and dry kitchen complemented bystain-proof quartz countertops enable residents to maximize their time with loved ones and friends, while minimizing stress and chaos associated with cooking.
Additionally, nearly every room within the apartment, especially the bathroom, will host unobstructed, panoramic views of the awe-inspiring emerald-green Beira Lake, the exquisite Indian Ocean coastline, and the brilliant city skyline at night. Hence, residents will be able to relax in the tub, balcony, or bedroom, and enjoy the uplifting visual experience that CCC has to offer.
The residences, subsequently spanning from 2-bedroom and 3-bedroom apartments to four-bedroom and five-bedroom penthouses, also include luxurious amenities that truly enrich and invigorate the residential experience at Colombo City Centre.
All residents will receive exclusive access to an infinity pool and gymnasium that will provide them the benefit of partaking in a more active lifestyle. Plus, the private sky lounge perched on the 43rd floor will offer residents 360? views of the coastline, lake, and city, as well as a perfect space for meetings, parties, and social gatherings.
