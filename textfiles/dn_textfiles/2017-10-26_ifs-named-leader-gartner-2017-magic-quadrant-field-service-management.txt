IFS named leader in Gartner 2017 Magic Quadrant  for field service management

"Field service management is an area that we are passionate about at IFS. Being named a leader for the third consecutive time in this Magic Quadrant and also positioned the highest in the 2017 report on our ability to execute, we believe proves that our hard work in product development together with a dedicated industry focus is paying off,” said Mark Brewer, Global Industry Director for Service Management at IFS.
IFS has the past year undertaken several key initiatives to maximize the value of our field service management offering. These include (1) acquiring service companies, field service management, mplsystems and WorkWave has bolstered the service offering and competence significantly on a global scale; (2) launching an IoT-enabled field service management solution, IFS FSM 5.7, with intelligent field service capabilities and enhanced user experience; (3) continued to develop the IFS FSM offering to support our key industry processes and increased mobility needs, from specific vertical functionality and workflows, to implementation templates and training documentation; and (4) investment in new technologies to drive productivity, efficiency and increased ROI for our customers while improving their service offerings.
Gartner estimates that revenue from packaged FSM software applications — including maintenance and service revenue — amounted to $2.07 billion during the 12 months ending in March 2017 (up approximately 21% from 2016).
According to the Gartner report, “Leaders demonstrate a market-defining vision of how technology can help service professionals achieve business objectives. Leaders have the ability to fulfill their vision through products, services, ecosystems and solid business results in the form of revenue and earnings. They also have solid new references from multiple geographies and industries. Leaders have significant, successful customer deployments in North America, EMEA and Asia/Pacific in a wide variety of industries, with multiple proof points above 2,000 users. They have a robust native scheduling engine that is scalable to thousands of technicians, strong and innovative technology-based service enablers (such as IoT enablement, social collaboration, machine learning and chatbots); coverage, either directly or through certified partners, of all six categories of FSM; many successful integrations to multiple systems of record (especially ERP and CRM systems) from multiple providers; and multiple deployments in multitenant deployment models.
Other providers measure themselves against the Leaders and emulate their strategies and tactics. Leaders demonstrate market strength, based on installed-base depth, and they affect market trends in terms of all the criteria by which they are evaluated. Leaders' software users often consider that they are gaining a competitive advantage over others in their industry.”
