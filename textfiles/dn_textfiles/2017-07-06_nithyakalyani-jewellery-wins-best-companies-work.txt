Nithyakalyani Jewellery wins as Best Companies to work for

Nithyakalyani Jewellery Wellawatte, a pioneer manufacturer and exporter of jewellery spanning for four decades, was recognised as one of Sri Lanka’s 25 best companies to work for in the annual workplace culture study conducted by Great Place to Work (Sri Lanka) and was honored at the recently concluded awards ceremony held at the Cinnamon Grand.
Great Place to Work Inc. (USA), a global specialist in high-trust and performance workplace cultures, provides the guidance needed to build, sustain and recognize outstanding workplace cultures.
It has reached out to over 100 million employees in 57 countries through 30 years of research in providing a model and benchmarking facility continuously validating what it means to be a great workplace.
In its fifth consecutive year of study in Sri Lanka, over 100 organisations across 16 sectors were validated and Nithyakalyani Jewellery was selected as one of the top 25 companies to work for in Sri Lanka, making it the only jeweller in this elite list. “To be placed among some of the respected establishments in Sri Lanka is a great recognition for a family owned business like ours and for the employees who take pride in working for us.
We will continue to look at important aspects in improving employee experience and creating the best workplace for them” said Dhivakar Balasubramaniam, Associate Partner at Wellawatte Nithyakalyani Jewellery on their achievement.
