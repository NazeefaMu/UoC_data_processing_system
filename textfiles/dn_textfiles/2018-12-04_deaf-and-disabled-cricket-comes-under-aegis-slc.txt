Deaf and Disabled cricket comes under aegis of SLC

Sri Lanka Deaf and Disable Cricket were recognized by the Minister of Sports Faiszer Mustapha who wanted both sports bodies to be affiliated to Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC). He made this remark at the press conference held at SLC premises yesterday.
Minister Mustapha further said that equal rights should be given to these sports not only in cricket but also other disabled sports to help them develop their skills.
“Disabled and deaf athletes also look for equal opportunities and rights not sympathies. We must look into this to ensure their rights too,” said the Minister.
“Today onward these sports will be affiliated to the SLC and they don’t need to worry about their sponsors in the future. They will get equal facilities like able cricketers,” he said.
Sri Lankan deaf cricketers created history when they beat India by 36 runs to win the Deaf ICC T-20 cricket world cup played at the Teri Gram Cricket grounds in Gurgaon, India on December 1. This is the first time Sri Lanka deaf cricketers had achieved such a milestone.
During the pre-tournament the Sri Lanka Deaf Cricket Association suffered with lack of financial support and on the instructions of President Maithripala Sirisena, the Sports Minister directed Sri Lanka Cricket to sponsored the team for the tournament.
All the players, coaches and officials were awarded with 500 USD cash prize given by Sri Lanka Cricket.
Sri Lanka Captain Dinesh Chandimal and Roshen Silva also graced the occasion.
Chandimal said this was a proud moment for Sri Lanka cricket after winning the world cup in 1996 and the world T20 in 2014 for the deaf cricketers to win the world cup.
SLC Competent Authority Kamal Pathmasiri, director general of sports Dhammika Muthugala and SLC CEO Ashley de Silva were also present at the occasion.
