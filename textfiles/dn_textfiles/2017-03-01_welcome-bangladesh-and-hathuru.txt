Welcome Bangladesh and Hathuru

The Bangladesh cricketers are with us for a series of two Tests, three One-Day Internationals and two T20 Internationals but unlike previous tours this one will be quite different. That difference comes in the shape of their head coach who is none other than former Sri Lanka cricketer and one-time shadow coach to the national team Chandika Hathurusingha.
Ever since Hathurusingha was appointed head coach of Bangladesh in May 2014, he has managed to change the fortunes of the team and turned them into a fighting and winning unit who has started to believe in themselves. Priority was given to discipline which eventually leads to success. No one was spared not even Bangladesh’s star all-rounder Shakib-Al Hasan who was suspended for six months by the Bangladesh Cricket Board for his ‘serious misbehaviour’ with Hathurusingha who had just stepped in as the team coach. This is reflected in their performances since Hathurusingha took over. Test match losses which were frequent during the pre-Hathurusingha era has now become few and far between. Since Hathurusingha’s advent as coach Bangladesh has lost only seven out of 15 Tests and won 4 which include a historic maiden Test win over Alastair Cook’s England side.
Where Bangladesh has made great strides is in the fifty-over One-Day Internationals where they have won 21 out of 30 matches, lost 16 and two ending in no-results. This includes historic series wins over Pakistan, India and South Africa and for the first time in their history a quarter-final place in the 2015 Cricket World Cup held in Australia and New Zealand.
Over the years Bangladesh has found Sri Lanka to be a tough opponent to beat in the Test circuit and their record proves it – 14 losses in 16 Tests. But under Hathurusingha who would know the strengths and weaknesses of his own countrymen and how they play their cricket, Bangladesh could fancy their chances of breaking that long standing hoodoo. Last October they recorded their maiden Test win over England and in Test matches they have frequently run up big first innings totals scoring 595-8 decl against New Zealand at Wellington in January this year – their second highest Test total, and since Hathurusingha took over gone over the 500-run mark on two other occasions against Pakistan and Zimbabwe. Bangladesh’s highest Test total is at Galle - venue of the first Test of the upcoming series. On their last tour to the country in 2013 they piled up a massive 638 all out with Mushfiqur Rahim, the captain setting the pace with a brilliant double century. He was supported by Mohammad Ashraful (190) and Nasir Hossain (100) who also made hundreds. On that flat Galle track a total of eight centuries were scored that included a century in each innings from the great Kumar Sangakkara.
One of the main reasons why Bangladesh has not been able to beat Sri Lanka is because of the presence of the ‘Big Three’ – Mahela Jaywawardene, Kumar Sangakkara and Tillakaratne Dilshan who have proved to be their stumbling block many a times. Of the 31 Test centuries Sri Lanka has scored against Bangladesh the trio has contributed 16 in toto.
The upcoming series sees a young Sri Lanka team in the stages of rebuilding following the retirements of the ‘Big Three’ and although they struck it rich against Steve Smith’s Australians whitewashing them 3-0 in July-August last year, Bangladesh who are a subcontinent team as much as Sri Lanka will know how to handle spin and they have some top quality spinners in their line-up as well.
Following the retirements of Jayawardene and Sangakkara two classy players of spin, the Lankan batting has been exposed badly especially against the turning ball where their top order batters have been found wanting. With their most experienced batter in the lineup skipper Angelo Mathews unavailable for the series because of injury the onus will be heavily on the rest of the batters to up their game and deliver if they are to prevent Bangladesh from creating history on Lankan soil.
Since their elevation to full membership of the ICC in 2000, Bangladesh has come a long way as a Test playing country and after 15 years they are showing some signs of becoming a tough competitive unit under the guidance of coach Hathurusingha. So it will be a historic occasion for the Tigers as they also call themselves when they play their 100th Test match at the P Sara Oval – a venue for many of Sri Lanka’s memorable Test matches notably the inaugural Test against England in 1982 and their first Test victory against India three years later.
It would be pertinent to refresh the memories of the cricketing public how Hathurusingha ended up coaching Bangladesh and not Sri Lanka. He was being groomed to take over as head coach of the national team when he was made shadow coach under Australian Trevor Bayliss. Hathurusingha had worked himself up the ladder by being a successful coach with the Sri Lanka ‘A’ sides. However the decision to take disciplinary action against Hathurusingha over some trivial incident by the interim committee headed by DS de Silva in 2011 saw him pack up his bags and go to Australia where he enriched himself by coaching one of the top state sides New South Wales and later the Australia’s ‘A’ team before taking up his present appointment with the Bangladesh Cricket Board. Sri Lanka’s loss has become Bangladesh’s gain and the signs are ominous for the upcoming Test, ODI and T20I series.
