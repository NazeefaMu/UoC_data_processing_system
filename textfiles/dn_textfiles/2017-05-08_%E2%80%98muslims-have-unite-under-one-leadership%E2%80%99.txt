‘Muslims have to unite under one leadership’

Muslims never get solutions for their present problems if the political leaders of Muslims do not unite under one leadership, Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs State Minister M.L.A.M. Hizbullah said.
He said Muslim Leaders must unite for getting their rights beyond their political aspirations. “The religious leaders have to work hard for uniting them together,” he said..
He was addressing the gathering of the opening ceremony of Late Meeran Mubeen Aalim building at Kathankudy in Batticaloa recently.
“If we blame each other, we will not be able to find and get solutions for our present problems. Once if we found solutions for the Irakkamem and Wilpattu problems, we will face some other problems in the future to be created,” he said.
“At this moment, we do not want to be a politician of passing the time without working towards the strong solution for the Muslims’ problems.
We have to be ready to face the challenges and become a powerful community to face them,” he said..
“If we blame each other on the serious issues , we ourselves disappoint us.
The religious leaders have to play a vital role in uniting the Muslim political leaders under one umbrella, Hisbullah said.
