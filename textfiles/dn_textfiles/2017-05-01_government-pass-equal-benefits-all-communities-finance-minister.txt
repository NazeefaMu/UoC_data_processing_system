Government to pass equal  benefits to all communities: Finance Minister

Government intends to pass on equal benefits of sustainable development to all communities, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said.
The minister was delivering the keynote address of the 4th High Level Dialogue of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and Pacific (ESCAP) in Bangkok, Thailand on April 28.
Asia Pacific nations recognise Sri Lankan government’s policy on sustainable development. Sri Lanka has embarked on a new journey towards sustainable development thereby intending to pass on its benefits equally to every citizen in the country, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said.
The minister said the population in the region is ageing faster than the growth of development and therefore, necessary infrastructure should be in place to meet the demand.
Minister Karunanayake was also inducted as the chairman of conference. It is significant that participating countries to recognise Sri Lanka for its initiatives taken to restore financial discipline and transparency.
“Asia and the Pacific is the most disaster-prone region in the world. Between 1970 and 2014, the region has been affected by more than 5,223 natural disasters according to ESCAP Statistics, and that was 43 percent of the globally reported disasters. More than 6 billion people in the region were affected by natural disasters accounting for 89 percent of the global total.
Natural disasters cause loss of lives as well as massive financial losses. Asia and the Pacific alone reported economic losses amounting to almost US dollars 1.22 trillion for this, or 44 percent of the global total. During the past 10 years alone, climate related disasters in Asia and the Pacific caused damages of US Dollars 367 billion, resulted in the death of nearly 300,000 people, and a total of 1.37 billion people were affected, the minister said.
Sri Lanka is going through a remarkable transition today powered by a well-crafted medium-term macroeconomic policy framework. Sri Lanka now has a peaceful environment to do business after ending three-decade long separatist movement. But as the new government took office in January 2015, Sri Lanka had to tackle an array of challenges from many fronts, the minister said.
“Our policy is focused towards developing the country containing broad policies of national importance that will assist the achievement of the far reaching reforms. My theme for the National Budget 2017 was ‘Accelerated growth with social inclusion’, which placed great emphasis on the alleviation of poverty in all manifestations beginning 2017. Social inclusion is a matter of prime concern and the participation of the entire population in the journey for development is a noble objective being ‘a society for all’. Such efforts will lay tremendous emphasis on social inclusion and sustainability in economic development, a commitment to achieve the United Nations proclaimed UN Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 ensuring shelter, safe drinking water and improved living standards for all,” the minister said.
“I wish to note that while the government is strongly committed to ensuring growth with social inclusion, the fiscal space remains constrained with historically low revenues of around 10-12 percent of GDP. Thus in the last two years in particular, significant emphasis has been placed on increasing revenue to augment the revenue to GDP ratio to at least 15-17 percent in the medium term. As such, measures have been taken to broaden the tax base through elimination of exemptions. We will also be introducing a new Inland Revenue Act, which has a simplified tax code and it is expected to facilitate better administration and compliance. At the same time, the introduction of Revenue Administration Management Information System (RAMIS) which connects the three revenue institutions with 27 other entities is also expected to generate better efficiencies in revenue collection.
The Department of Customs and Excise also has seen structural improvements been introduced,” he said. Deputy Treasury Secretaries S.R. Attygalle, Chandra Ekanayake and Sri Lankan Ambassador to Thailand Kshenuka Senevirathna was present.
Representatives from economic and financial sectors of countries from Asia and the Pacific region are participating in the conference.
