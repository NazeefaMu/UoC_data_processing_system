Gem and jewellery industry;
Immense potential to create employment and economic benefits

The FACETS International Gem and Jewelry Exhibition organized by the Sri Lanka Gem and Jewelry Association is scheduled to be held in September.
FACETS has provided small time gem and jewelry merchants with the ideal platform to gain recognition among foreign markets, a veritable window to the world. AS a result many former small timers are now doing well and the industry representatives are upbeat on this ‘positive trend’.
Chairman of the Sri Lanka Gem and Jewelry Association, A. H. M. Imtizam said, “The National Gem and Jewellery Authority (NGJA) and the Export Development Board (EDB) have played a significant role in constantly recognizing this need. Now, foreign buyers are on the lookout for FACETS and also for our special Ceylon Sapphire; the now know exactly where to look.”
Talking about the forthcoming event and the gem and jewellery industry in general, he said, “The gem industry has a long tradition going back to our ancient kings. It has provided a livelihood for thousands of people and is replete with stories of rags to riches. The industry continues to function under a system of profit sharing between the owner of the pit and the workers, which has been described as one of the best cooperative systems in the world. Today the industry is on par with that of any country.”
Imtizam said, “Sri Lanka is and has always been the source of most of the existing varieties of gem stones. The industry boasts a proud history of more than 2000 years and over the years we’ve shared our knowledge with many other countries including Madagascar and Tanzania.
Today we are capable of processing and adding value to material imported to Sri Lanka from foreign countries.The Gem & Jewelry industry currently utilizes a semi-automated process when it comes to production and manufacturing. Combining local and international knowledge with technology, the industry has fashioned a system that is all our own. We now also provide gem stones and jewelry designs for the watch industry. This calls for work of extreme precision and machinery of the highest standards,” said Imtizam, when questioned about the current situation of the Gem & Jewelry industry in Sri Lanka.
Speaking about the major challenges the industry has faced and is currently facing, Imtizam explained the biggest challenge faced by jewelry manufacturers today is the diminishing number of goldsmiths. The lack of awareness in the jewelry villages when it comes to modern technology and machinery is also a significant obstacle in the industry.
Talking about the industry’s influence on socio-economic situation, he said, “The vast amounts of net foreign exchange the industry earned and its impact on the economy has been significant, not just to those directly connected to the industry, but to all Sri Lankans. The money earned by the average gem dealers now goes into the education of family members and it is heartening to see the children of gem dealers now engaging in other fields bringing about a so called social revolution in the centers of the gem trade such as Ratnapura, Beruwala and Galle.”
Imtizam also said Sri Lanka boasts a true mine-to-market industry, both domestically and for export in a fascinating blend of tradition, experience and modernization. Mining is primarily done by use of traditional methods, and is small-scale by choice and design as such mines are considered to be less harmful to the environment and a more stable source of employment for more people.
Lapidary is another area in the trade where the traditional meets the modern in Sri Lanka. Centuries of experience in cutting and polishing continue alongside new technology and design models. The time-honored art of reading rough and orienting stones is integrated with the growing demand of the global market for exact calibration, well-balanced proportions and high quality polish.
Thus the Sri Lankan lapidary industry consists of a fascinating blend of high-powered techniques, utilizing some of the world’s greatest expertise in the orientation of rough, and a growing precision cutting and re-cutting sector that maintains the strictest of tolerances.
Talking about the future of the industry, Imtizam said, the industry has immense potential in terms of employment and economic benefits. The trade is ever willing to engage with the NGJA to formulate policies in this regard for the betterment of the industry and the country.”
