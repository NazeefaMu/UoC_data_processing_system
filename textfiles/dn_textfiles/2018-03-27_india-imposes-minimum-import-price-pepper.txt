India imposes minimum import price on pepper

Effective December 6, 2017, the Government of India has introduced a minimum import price (MIP) for pepper of Indian rupees 500 per kg which works out to USD 7,700 per mt.
As the Sri Lankan pepper market is around USD 4,600 it is not feasible for importers in India to import pepper because of this MIP.
This is another measure introduced by India to prevent imports of pepper which is allowed under the Free Trade Agreement. Besides, shipments that have been made earlier are also being subjected to considerable delay, in their clearance.
