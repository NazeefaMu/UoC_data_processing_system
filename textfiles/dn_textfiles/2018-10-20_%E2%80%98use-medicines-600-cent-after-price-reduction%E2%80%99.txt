‘Use of medicines up 600 per cent after price reduction’

The use of medicines has gone up 600 per cent compared with the time prior to introducing the drug prices reduction, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
He was addressing a press conference held in the Government Information Department Auditorium in Colombo yesterday.
The Minister said that in the past poor people did not take prescribed drugs because they could not afford them. Now they daily take drugs as per the medical advice since the prices of drugs gone down.
Minister Senaratne said that in developed countries four or five brands of one drug are available. “Sri Lanka has about 30 or 40 brands of the same drug. Some are of very low quality. Rs. 4.4 billion was saved after reducing the drug prices. Still drug companies earn a huge profit,” the Minister said.
National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) Chairman Prof. Asitha De Silva said the drug prices were reduced as per the WHO rules, regulations and recommendations.
“No drug company has officially informed the NMRA that they will leave the Sri Lankan drug market. No doctor or any association of doctors has complained about a possible shortage of high quality drugs. The drug market is between US $ 850 and 950 and the drug price reduction has given relief for people who use drugs for lifetime to control Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs). The market of certain drugs has gone up by 236 per cent. Rs. 4.5 billion was saved from cancer drugs. The NMRA has registered high quality drugs used in Australia and Europe,” he said..
State Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing Corporation (SPMC) Chairman Dr. Sayuru Samarasundara said the SPMC earns a huge profit even after selling drugs for very low prices. “The high prices of glucometers were regulated from September 1 after considering many things. A bonus of Rs. 2,500 is given to a pharmacy when it sold five glucometers, he said..
Consultant Pediatrician and Clinical Head of the Centre for Clinical Management of Dengue and Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever, Negombo, Dr. Lakkumara Fernando said the media campaign against the reduction of drug prices has hidden agendas. “In the past, high quality drugs could not be prescribed because of the high prices. Now high quality drugs are prescribed since anybody can afford them. Reducing drug prices has given a huge relief for the doctors who treat patients with quality drugs,” he said.
Consultant Physician, Infectious Diseases Hospital and Dengue Specialist Dr. Ananda Wijewickrama said certain brands of drugs left the drug market long before the introduction of drug price reduction.
Surgeon Nissanka Jayawardana, the Pharmaceutical Traders Association Head Kapila de Zoysa and few others spoke.
