[APPRECIATIONS - (23-11-2015)]

Admiral Clancy Fernando:
A true Son of Mother Lanka
The 23rd death anniversary of Admiral Clancy Fernando, the 11th Commander of the Navy fell on November 16. His name is etched in history as the highest-ranking military officer to make the Supreme Sacrifice for his motherland. He was a man of fiery enthusiasm and total commitment for his country.
Admiral Fernando was assassinated on November 16, 1992 along the Galle Face Centre Road in the heart of Colombo when a LTTE suicidal cadre rammed an explosive laden motorcycle into his vehicle.
It was a bright sunny day and I called the Admiral at Navy House to explain how a series of strange events prevented me from joining him on the drive from his official residence to Naval Headquarters. By then, he was getting ready to leave and said: “Thank you, I’ll be there” and replaced the receiver, not knowing that it was the last telephone conversation in his life.
After a few minutes, I switched on the communication set to monitor his movement. Suddenly, I heard confused exchange of messages and my office telephone started to ring. On line was Admiral Fernando's wife and she could only say “Shemal”. Within seconds, I whisked off in my vehicle and as I drove past the old Parliament along Galle Road, I saw it all.
As I approached the scene many things crossed my mind. Until I saw Admiral Fernando lying face down as if asleep sprawled diagonally across the seat in a pool of blood inside the car which had turned turtle, I did not believe that he was dead.
Admiral Fernando had been killed instantly by the blast. He could never have known what had happened to him. To die with no time for fear or regrets, doing what he enjoyed as a brave Naval Officer to end not with a whimper but with a bang that reverberated around the world - that truly was the fate he would have chosen for himself.
That was my recollection of the assassination of Admiral Clancy Fernando. I deem it a privilege to have known him, received his wise counsel and enjoyed serving him as his Aide and Personal Secretary throughout his tenure of office, which spanned from August 1, 1991 to November 16, 1992.
I wish to comment on his career briefly and especially the qualities that struck me most about him during the times I spent under him firstly in the Naval Dockyard in Trincomalee in 1988, 1989 and 1990 and then at the Naval Headquarters in 1991 and 1992. He was born on October 10, 1938 as Wannakuwatta Waduge Erwin Clancy Fernando and had his education at Prince of Wales College, Moratuwa.
Clancy Fernando decided that a life under the ocean wave was his manifest destiny. And he joined the then Royal Ceylon Navy on December 17, 1957.
Most of his early days in the then Royal Ceylon Navy were at Trincomalee, Tangalle and Karainagar besides his long spells at sea. He had served on board HMCyS Aliya and HMCyS Gajabahu, a Frigate which was the then Flag Ship. Also, he commanded HMCyS Diyakawa, SLNS Ranakamee and SLNS Samudra Devi, the Flag Ship of the Sri Lanka Navy in 1980.
He attended the Defence Services Staff College, Wellington, India in 1977. He was promoted to the rank of Commander on March 1, 1978. He held the appointments of Commanding Officer of SLNS Tissa in the East, Commanding Officer of SLNS Elara in the North and as the Master of the Ceylon Shipping Corporations M/V Lanka Kanthi.
On June 30, 1983 he was made the Director Naval Operations and with his promotion to the rank of Captain on January 1, 1984 he was appointed as the Commandant of the Naval and Maritime Academy and made invaluable contributions towards moulding young officers and men.
He was elevated Commodore on July 1, 1986 and held key appointments of the Commander Western Naval Area, Commander Eastern Naval Area and Security Forces Commander for Trincomalee District where he aptly proved his strengths as a competent and an efficient administrator. Then, he was elevated to the position of the Chief of Staff on April 4, 1990.
He held memberships of the British Institute of Management, the Nautical Institute of UK and Royal Naval Institute of Navigation, UK. He possessed a Masters Degree in Defence Studies and had been conferred with the Master Mariner Certificate. He was the first President of the Sri Lanka Branch of the Nautical Institute, UK. He was promoted Rear Admiral on March 29, 1991.
He was in good stead when career took its next and decisive turn and he was made Acting Commander of the Navy on August 1, 1991. This ultimate promotion consoled him for some, at least, of the pains and fortified him for the struggles that lay ahead. It did, but until the official letter arrived he did not allow himself to be certain that he had achieved the ambition of his lifetime to reach the helm of the Navy.
“First Day as COMNAV” was his diary entry for Day 1. From the word go, I saw him work, work and work towards betterment of the Navy. Everything seemed to take off the ground all at once. For his 50 odd years, he displayed an energy and enthusiasm that would shame a younger officer.
In what his greatness laid is harder to define. What he could do with superlative aplomb was to identify the object at which he was aiming, select the method, which was most likely to achieve it, and force it through to its conclusion.
A powerful, analytical mind of crystalline clarity, a superabundance of energy, great persuasive powers and endless resilience in the face of setback or disaster rendered him the most formidable of Commanders.
His was a dynamic personality blended with a personal charm and magnanimity all his own but it was his quality of gentleman leadership that always stroll the show. Wherever he went, whatever he did, he blazed the trail for others to follow. Undoubtedly, he inspired all who served and sailed under him.
During this time, he played an active role in all military operations and was a familiar sight on the frontlines. In Vettilakeni, Pooneryn, Nagativanturai and Elephant Pass and even regularly travelling on small Naval craft on the Kilali Lagoon. He took enormous risks to boost the morale of his men and exhort them on.
He was a dedicated leader of his men who gave his total commitment to defending the national cause of peace, unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity. He rendered splendid logistic support to the successful joint operations that were carried out in the North. It was the Naval backing that enabled the forces to expand the forward defence line in Jaffna. His courage, energy and determination were unimpaired. Reluctant or not, he took considerable pride in his performance. I still remember him walking across the unclear pathway leading to Elephant Pass within minutes after the siege was broken.
His patience, integrity and devotion to duty struck me as being beyond normal. He was unfailingly courteous and considerate. His tolerance was extraordinary; his readiness to respect and listen to the views of others was remarkable throughout his life.
He strode the Navy like a colossus during his tenure of office giving of his best. For achievements he never took credit alone - but spread applause thick, sharing it with his peers and colleagues, but blame and criticism was received by him and him alone. He attended the prestigious National Defence College in New Delhi, India in 1987.
As a good Buddhist he displayed the quality of equanimity to it’s fullest. I was amazed when at times he faced both triumph and disaster alike. Similarly, he accepted any defeat and he faced many in his day with a sense of stoic calm.
It was Admiral Fernando who revived and formed Buddhist, Christian, Muslim and Hindu Councils in the Sri Lanka Navy. This resulted in conduct of religious events to commemorate the ‘Navy Day’ annually and to bestow blessings on the Navy, Naval personnel and their families since 1991.
Admiral Fernando’s idea of relaxation was to turn to his pastimes. He took a keen interest in Naval history and displayed his scholastic skills by publishing several articles. His book on Customs and Etiquettes of the Services depicts his vast experience and knowledge of the subject. By devising first ever cryptographic system SINHALE in the Sri Lanka Navy, he exhibited the miracles of modern communication. It replaced the Royal Navy’s ‘Britese’ System.
He took a lively interest in the affairs of the retired Naval personnel as well. One significant event he personally organised with great pride was the ‘Sea Burial’ of ashes of the 4th Commander of the Navy, Rear Admiral Royce de Mel. Also, it was him who initiated action to construct a monument in honour of the war heroes of the Sri Lanka Navy in Welisara in 1991.
He was the brainchild of the Navy’s President Colours and Staff. His enthusiasm towards tracing the history of Naval guns and canons was noteworthy and the same paved the way for the establishment of the Naval Museum in Naval Dockyard, Trincomalee. Also, he was instrumental in introducing the new look ‘Navy List’ in 1991.
Admiral Fernando was an all round sportsman and rendered yeoman services to uplift sports in the Navy. Someone once asked him which he preferred - tennis, shooting or golf. After a moment’s reflection he replied, “Well, golf, after all, is a professional’s game”. He was in the early fifties when he embarked on golf but he really enjoyed it.
His was a place for family reunion: a few friends were asked to stay but only if it was known that they would fit in happily with the established patters of existence. To his family and close friends Admiral Fernando was the wisest, the most honourable of men.
His was a Naval family and his happiness centred on it.
This tribute is an attempt to retain Admiral Clancy Fernando’s life and ideals fresh in our minds. Indeed, the fragrance of his memory remains green in the minds of the vast array of Sri Lankans who were privileged to make contact with him.
The whole Nation bade farewell to him with full Naval honours and with heavy hearts. The epilogue of the funeral oration still lingers in my memory, “Sir, though you have departed from us, your name and service shall be remembered by us forever as a great Patriotic Officer and a Gentleman, a true Son of Mother Lanka who has made the Supreme Sacrifice in defence of our country. As you fade away beneath the waves, we will steer your course with all guns blazing”.

Rex de Silva:
Bouquets and teardrops for an Editor
Editor Rex de Silva taught us all the intricacies of journalism, but he did not prepare us to write about our feelings when he is gone.
Editor of the SUN and WEEKEND newspapers of Independent newspapers, Rex de Silva also wrote under the pen names of Norexa and Don Mithuna. His international columns reigned in the newspaper world in that era. Later, Rex de Silva became editor of the Borneo Bulletin (from 1990 – 2001) where he won new hearts. He was also a foreign correspondent for the dpa, Deutsche Presse Agentur, and a revered journalist in that land too.
But on that Sunday in November 2015, as news happened, this editor lay still on a hospital bed surrounded by his family – his wife Ranjini, sons Nishan and Dilantha, sister Arlene and brother Darryl were among them.
That day he lay almost still breathing softly. His eyes were closed. I remembered the many years when he was awake through the day until 10 every night, going through the pages of a daily newspaper the SUN, and the WEEKEND.
His hands were still. I remembered how he used to wave at us as he climbed the sunlit staircase at the Dawasa building and walked into office, carrying his backpack, wearing his blue denim suit, his dark sunglasses, and a smile.
His fingers were quivering slightly: unlike the time he used to hit away at his typewriter, typing at perhaps 40 words-a-minute with just two fingers.
I spoke to him and he did not answer: I remembered the time when all we heard was his baritone voice urging us to finish reading the pages or calling out to us by our names…
If ever Rex de Silva has been ‘unkind’ in word or deed it is when he used to point his index finger in the form of revolver, make a shooting sound and ‘fire us’ - on days we were late to work. Emanating love, good nature and a warm compassion for all human beings, Editor-in-Chief Rex de Silva was truly a textbook boss.
Rex de Silva — editor, photographer, lay out wizard, cartoonist, painter and foreign correspondent —was one human being excelling in different art forms and outshining in the greatest of them all – in being humane.
Editor Rex de Silva taught journalism to hundreds of cub reporters.We all learned the hard way, akin to learning driving in a Morris Minor. He pushed us all and made us realise that there are no limits to brilliance, and this he led by example.
Rex de Silva applauded our successes, laughed with us as we laughed, and was moved to tears during our difficult and sad times. He got me to write many letters but not one of them had been a letter of termination or a letter suspending a journalist. Calling for explanations, making life difficult for those who worked for him and creating problems for people were never heard of during the times of this great editor.
Though he was smothered with work day and night, he always urged us to take a deep breath and ‘forget it’ when we went to him with a problem. He had time for us, time to console us and encourage us. Rex de Silva knew everyone’s secrets and had so much information that he could have worked for the intelligence service.He was everyone’s confidante and a friend of a life time. All his journalists were precious to him in a special way and he enjoyed a special bonding with each and every one of us. This is the nearness, the concern and the following he had that made him special. To him, we were still his team, still to be looked after.
Then came this day in November, our dear Editor Rex de Silva who taught and nurtured a hundred journalists and more, lay still. His soft breathing, and the clock near his hospital bed ticking by, taught me a key lesson in life – to cherish the moments that we have with people.
On that Monday in November, it seemed like someone had pressed the pause button in the world of journalism.
Media giants, veteran editors, media desk heads and several successful writers were at a loss for words as they felt a great sadness. Charles Rex de Silva breathed his last as the sun broke away from the dark clouds on Monday morning in Colombo.
As we look around today we see the fragrance of a legacy of professionalism left behind by this great literary giant Rex de Silva. We see co-editors who have worked with Rex de Silva - genteel people as Sinha Ratnatunga, Editor-in-chief of The Sunday Times, Lakshman Gunasekera, Editor of The Sunday Observer, and Lalith Alahakoon, Editor of the Ceylon Daily News, award-winning Defence Correspondent and Editor Iqbal Athas, and Prasad Gunewardena among others.
We see other media giants such as Arjuna Ranawana, Tyron Devotta, Faizal Samath and award-winning writers and section heads as Kumudini Hettiarachchi, Renuka Sadanandan, Zanita Careem, Anthony David, Sanath Weerasooriya, Louis Benedict and Ameen Izzadeen.
We see our SUN/WEEKEND family members take forth their successes from their desks at the SUN and WEEKEND newspapers to the international arena – journalists as Dinoo Kelleghan, Raine Wickrematunge, Trevine Rodrigo, Dirk Tissera, Lawrence Machado, Lawrence Heyn, Rohan Gunaratna, Daleena Samara, Thilak Seneviratne, Joe Van Langenberg, Roy Denish, other successful people as Lyn Ockersz, Kshama Ranawana Chris Dharmakirti, Jumar Preena, Alvin Sally, Sarasi Wijeratne, Minoli de Soysa, Daleena Samara, are also among the fine journalists who reflect Rex de Silva’s leadership success.
Editor Rex de Silva’s era at the SUN had many people ‘coming and going’ – If the SUN newspaper was a military academy – then there would have been about 25 intakes and more. And there would have been medals and decorations too.
In fact, the late editor of The Sunday Leader Lasantha Wickrematunge, who became one of the greater investigative journalists and editors of our time was interviewed and handpicked by Rex de Silva. Senior journalists the late Eustace Wijetunge, late Y.G. de Silva, the late Kenneth Amarasekera, the late Anil Atapattu always shared a laugh about some event or happening, with our Editor Rex de Silva before they set about their daily work.
Independent Newspapers Limited was a gigantic publishing house at that time. Chairman Percy Gunasena and Managing Directors Sepala Gunasena and Director Mano Gunasena comprised the management. Editor Rex de Silva was the link between the journalists/sub editors and the management, for we seldom got to meet the management.
The list of journalists was long – and Editor Rex de Silva was able to nurture the special talent in each one of us – Raine Amarasinghe, Nirmali Hapugoda, Palitha Samarajiwa, Lasanda Kurukulasuriya, Anoma Tillekeratne, Jenniffer Henricus, Dexter Crusz, Delerine Wijeratne, Aruna Kulatunga, Sakuntala Navaratnam, Gaya Gamhewage, Kishali Pinto Jayawardena, Leon Berenger, Nayomini Ratnayake, Roshan Karunatilleka, Lasantha Alwis, Jayalakshmi, Ranjan Amarasinghe, Sunil Wijesekera, Rohan Abeywardene, Christine Nadarajah, Maryanne Perera, Jack Herft, Maryanne Noyahr, Jenniffer Barthelot, Saroj Perera, Shyamala Selvaratnam, Khema de Silva, Sharmini Dias Nagahawatte, Charnika Munasinghe, Kumari Gunasekera, Christine Fernando, Rehani Moraes, Piarina de Lima, Hemmamali de Silva, Dulani Tampoe, Kendall Hopman, Melanie John, Leary Beekmeyer, Winston de Valliere, Malkanthi Leitan, Chandani Kirinde, Milinda Rajasekera, Percy Mayadunne, M.H.M Manasique, Asoka Rajapaksa, Larry Campbell, Siva Ilankesan, Kapila Bandara, Duminda Ariyasinghe, Ameen Izzadeen, Zacki Jabbar, Riyaz Nadeem, Shiran Wijesinghe, Harry Jayachandra, T.B. Rahaman, and internationally acclaimed cartoonist the late Mark Gerreyn and late Amitha Abeysekerawere but a handful of the talent team.
Editor Rex de Silva had many friends but his social life was limited to telephone conversations or atete-a-tete in office. He had special friends whose writings he admired as Ilika Malkanthi Karunaratne, Suren Peiris, Premil Ratnayake, Chandra Perera, Felicia Sorensen, among others. Rex de Silva had no time to socialize. He walked into office at 8 a.m. and stayed on till 10 p.m. Along with his wife Ranjini and little sons Nishan and Dilantha, Rex had another family – a family of journalists, each one waiting for him to come to office to take a problem, have a heart to heart or sometimes cry on his shoulder. Rex was able to comfort them and solve the most gnawing problems. They always left his room with a smile.
As if this army of journalists were not enough, Editor Rex de Silva led a team of dedicated photographers. It was not an era of clicking and uploading. Photographers had to take the photos and go to the studio to get them printed, while we waited with our copies in hand for the photographs to arrive.
As news happened Rex de Silva took full command of the team of photographers – among them the late Berty Mendis, Gamini Wickremesinghe, Dunstan Wickremaratne, Lakshman Gunatilleke, Anura Gunasekera, Pushpakumar Matugama, Thilak Seneviratne, Gemunu Wellage, Padmasiri Gamage, Dhammika Nimmalasuriya, Upul Handunge…
Editor Rex de Silva made us laugh with his good-natured jokes. He made the world laugh with his witty Ibson cartoons depicting a tortoise. At first I was slow to understand his obsession about this tortoise, and then he told me about all his star tortoises at home and showed me ‘exclusive’ photos of the private life of frogs taken in the middle of the night.
Despite his popularity, power and position he was a soft-hearted human being. I managed to give him two kittens I found on the road, without any effort, simply by saying that their mother was killed in a road accident.
Rex de Silva had a strange affinity with the universe - the kingdom of birds, bees, the planets and alien life, the world of flowers and trees – made Rex de Silva blend with the universe in a very special way.
Today, the flowers, trees, birds, the tortoises and the sea and life beneath, all remind us of him - of this great life we lost. Yet these chirping birds and colourful flowers also remind us of the great bouquet that he left behind.
We can only be thankful that he has given the world two representatives in the forms of his successful sons Nishan and Dilantha de Silva. As our thoughts go to them and to his ever-loving wife Ranjini, his brothers and sisters, we feel a deep and painful sadness and an emptiness within.
All journalists great and small are today searching for words and are trying to focus our tear-filled eyes to continue in our chosen professions. For only teardrops have become the kick-off to a very personal story written at a time when dark clouds hover over the memories of the times spent at the SUN.
