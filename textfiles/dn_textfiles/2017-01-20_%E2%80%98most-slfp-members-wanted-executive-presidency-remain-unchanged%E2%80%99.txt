‘Most SLFP members wanted executive presidency to remain unchanged’

 Skills Development and Vocational Training Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said the views of most of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party members were that the Executive Presidency should remain unchanged.
He made this observation yesterday at a press conference held at the Sri Lanka Freedom Party auditorium.
He also said that most of the Central Committee members of the SLFP were of that opinion and future discussions would be taken in this regard at the Central Committee.
"President Maithripala Sirisena was of a different opinion and he went further to move a motion in Parliament to abolish the powers of the Executive Presidency," Minister Samarasinghe said.
"However, the Court decided that the President is elected by the people so that curtailing of powers should be approved by the people at a referendum."
He also said that where the manifesto is concerned, the President had clearly said that he would do the changes within the powers of Parliament and would not go for a referendum.
He further said that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party did not accept the Federal situation to the country.
He added that if the Executive Presidency is in existence, the country is not Federal.
Questioned by the media if the same view was shared by the UNP on the Executive Presidency, Minister Samarasinghe said they speak on the views of the SLFP and they stand for it.
