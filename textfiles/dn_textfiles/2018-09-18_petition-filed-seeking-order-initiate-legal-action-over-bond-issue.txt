Petition filed seeking order to initiate legal action over Bond issue

A writ petition was filed in the Supreme Court seeking an order in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus compelling the Bribery Commission to initiate legal proceedings against all the suspects identified by the Central Bank Bond Commission Report dated December 30, 2017.
This petition had been filed by public Interest litigation activist and lawyer Nagananda Kodituwakku naming Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption and its members and Attorney General as respondents.
The petitioner further sought an order compelling the Bribery Commission to initiate a credible and independent investigation against the Chairman and members of the Bribery Commission and the Attorney General for the Commission of the offence corruption.
The Petitioner states that despite a lapse of over nine months since the publishing of the Commission’s final report, the respondents who are authorised to indict suspects involved in major financial crimes before the Permanent High Court at Bar, have failed to set the criminal law into motion against the suspects.
The petitioner states that the failure on the part of the respondents to act as required by law, amounts to a violation of the trust and confidence placed in them by the people of Sri Lanka, whose Executive power is being exercised by them.
