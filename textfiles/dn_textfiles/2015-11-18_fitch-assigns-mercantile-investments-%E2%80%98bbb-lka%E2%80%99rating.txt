Fitch assigns Mercantile Investments ‘BBB-(lka)’rating

Fitch Ratings Lanka has assigned Mercantile Investments and Finance (MIF) a National Long-Term Rating of ‘BBB-(lka)'. The outlook is stable. The agency has also assigned the company's outstanding senior unsecured debentures a National Long-Term Rating of ‘BBB-(lka)'.MIF's rating reflects its modest franchise stemming from its long operating history, satisfactory capitalisation and loan-book exposure to less risky customer segments relative to peers. However, its ratings also capture its high risk appetite, which is evident in its substantial exposure to equity investments, low profitability metrics relative to peers and greater reliance on concentrated and short-term funding.
Equity investments accounted for 16.8% of total assets at the end of the financial year to March 2015 (FYE15), much higher than the level at similarly rated peers, leaving the company vulnerable to market risk. In addition, MIF is in breach of the regulator's rule that limits equity investments to 25% of capital funds for non-bank financial institutions, with equity investments at 52.2% of capital funds at FYE15.
MIF's ROA has declined to 1.9% at end-1HFY16 from 3.2% at FYE13 largely due to weak net interest margin (NIM) and high impairment charges relative to peers. Fitch believes that a potential increase in operating costs due to branch expansion and an increase in credit costs could hamper operating profitability and internal capital generation.
Fitch views MIF's concentrated deposit base and high negative maturity mismatches as risks to its funding profile. Deposits are the main source of funding for MIF, but its deposit base is highly concentrated compared with similarly rated peers.
MIF's negative mismatches of assets and liabilities of less than one year are higher than that for similarly rated peers. It amounted to 47% of equity at end-October 2015, 50% at FYE15 and 65% at FYE14. Unutilised credit lines covered 52% of the negative mismatches at end-October 2015. Funding lines sourced by MIF by pledging its assets could help to reduce such mismatches.
