Kandana water treatment plant commences operation

The newly expanded Kandana Water Treatment Plant funded by the Japanese Government commenced distributing clean water to the public after it was ceremonially handed over to the National Water Supply and Drainage Board under the patronage of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Japanese Embassy Charge d’Affaires ad interim Koji Yagi on January 5.
The Japanese Government has provided 8,388 million Yen (approximately LKR. 10,628 million) for the Water Sector Development Project II, which includes the expansion of Kandana Water Treatment Plant to ensure safe water for over 800,000 people in the Colombo District. Japan, through its Official Development Assistance (ODA), contributed to Sri Lanka’s social and economic development over the past six decades. Japan helps water projects in Colombo and Kandy, Ampara, Anuradhapura, and Killinochchi districts among others.
The Japanese Government hope that the new plant will ensure safe drinking water to the local community and long term development in Sri Lanka.
