At half time the winners were trailing 15 points to 10.
Army lads showed better control of the ball in perfect conditions and turned the match in their favour with a rousing game carried out in the second half.
The soldiers were always sure of what to do, in contrast to the CH ruggerites who only knew to run straight often running into their opposite number, there by lost the grip and hopes of winning seemed thrust under a ‘dark cloud due to the game they played
However the CH and FC outfit staged a spirited performance in the first half by scoring two quick tries to take lead and go in to the breather with the scores reading 15 points to 10.
But the Army SC boys gave a superb brand of running rugby in the second half under the instructions of their head coach Nilfer Ibrahim, where they enjoyed major share of possession from the scrums, line outs, set pieces and the break downs by by giving a fine display to topple the CH team and dared to run the ball and gained territory whenever a gap in the opponents defence was detected.
Finally Army sealed the game by scoring only two tries in the entire game through wing three quarter Sudaraka Dikkumbura (one) and prop forward Shehan Silva (one) while the two conversions and the two penalties were slotted in by their reliable place kicker full back Gayan Salinda. Two speedy wing three quarters Dinushan Ariyapala- who is an ex Army SC player and the younger brother of present Army centre Imanka Ariyapala along with Heshan Maduranga scored one try apiece while full back cum ex St.Anthony's college star player and full back Samuel Maduwantha put over the solitary conversion and the penalty for the losing CH and FC side.
