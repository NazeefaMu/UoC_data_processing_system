Three year plan to devolop health sector

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne had made plans for the development of the health sector for the next three years, while the new Ministry Secretary should be able to implement them without any interruption, a Health Ministry spokesman said.
The Secretary appointed to the position will be on retirement by February and therefore he would be able to work in the position only for around six more months. Having a new Secretary who would be there for the next three years will be an advantage for the Health Ministry to implement the development plans without any interruption, he said.
