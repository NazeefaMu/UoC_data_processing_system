The right move

An English daily ran as its main story on Wednesday that President Maithripala Sirisena had proposed the setting up of a Committee headed by Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka to deal with emergency situations such as disruption to power, work stoppages at the port, fuel distribution etc. This was in response to several ministers pointing to the near anarchic situation that prevailed on Monday following the petroleum strike called by the CPC unions. It was pointed out at the Cabinet meeting chaired by the President that some 1,500 petroleum workers were able to cripple all government activities on that day and that there should not be a repetition of such a situation. The Ministers stressed that the military should be equipped to deal with emergency situations to ensure public life is not disrupted. That probably may have been the reason for the President to suggest that the war winning army commander head the Committee that will also include other stakeholders such as the military and the Law and Order Ministry.
The proposal, no doubt, will be welcomed by most who would not want the even tenor of their lives disrupted by anarchic elements who prevent essential services reaching them. Today, the city’s landscape is marred by frequent protest marches and agitations resulting in chaos on the highways. The New Year festival provided a welcome breather and the Petroleum strike signaled the return to business. The GMOA too has announced that it is going to devote the month of May for strike action, once again causing distress to the sick. The government is increasingly being conceived by the public as being soft in not tackling the situation with a heavy hand. Perhaps the Yahapalanaya tag attached to the regime has proved a millstone round the neck of the government. But it cannot stand by and watch as the country descends to anarchy. Decisive action is called for to ensure public life is not disrupted as a result of politically motivated strikes.
Governments are elected to govern. Different governments have different styles in governing. Their policies too differ. These policies may not be to the liking of some, Trade Unions included. But they (TUs) cannot be allowed to call the shots on matters that are unrelated to their personal welfare or work conditions, as was the case with regard to the Petroleum strike. The Unions struck work against an alleged move to sell the Trincomalee oil tank farm to the Indians. Even if such an agreement was to be signed, this certainly would not endanger the jobs of the strikers. Besides, this was a matter to do with the country’s trade and economy where they (TUs) have little or no stake. If the trade unions are allowed to dictate terms on how the government should conduct its economic policy there will be no knowing where things are going to end up. It will be akin to the doctors striking against ETCA which is well beyond their remit.
Be that as it may, agitations by trade unions are not always based on their own interests or that of the country. In a majority of the instances these TUs are being manipulated by politicians. A good example is the recent doctors’ strike where one of the GMOA’s big guns delivered a speech that took on a political flavour. The garbage crisis too saw the public being instigated by politicians.
True, most Trade Unions today operate on party lines to which there can be no objections. But it should be ensured that their actions don’t go beyond permissible limits. Monday’s petroleum strike came without warning that took the public unawares. It is the duty of any responsible government to ensure public life is not disrupted as a result of the denial of essential services. It should employ every means towards this end. If the military is deployed in the public interest to make sure essential supplies reach them without hindrance, so be it. It will be recalled that army personnel commandeered SLTB buses during the height of the JVP violence in 1989.
There is little doubt that more work stoppages and disruptions are in store in the coming days as the political temperature hots up. The government should be prepared for any eventuality. The strategy will be to target those services which the public cannot do without. This way the public wrath against the government would that much more pronounced. Anti-government TV channels would be dutifully on the scene to record the public indignation that would be beamed to the homes of the citizenry.
In Fonseka, the government will have the ideal choice to deal with emergency situations such as the petroleum strike. Declaring garbage collection an essential service did not have much impact. Protests are still continuing, with garbage trucks blocked from reaching their destinations. What is needed is a military presence to deal with such situations. The Joint Opposition too will not be able to blame the military for any highhanded action. If they do their “war hero” cries would be rendered hollow.
