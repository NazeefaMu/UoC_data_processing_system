Buddhika Ekanayaka’s life is inspiring and carries with it a powerful message. Even though he was born with a deformity, he has not let that prevent him from achieving his dreams. Buddhika has no arms or hands. Instead he has two stumps. Yet what he has achieved in his life is remarkable. His powerful message is that nothing is impossible and one should never give up.
If Ekanayaka can write, draw, use a cell phone, send SMS, use a lap top, play musical instruments and operate his own business then one has to raise the question – why can’t we with two hands and legs achieve what we put our mind to?
This is the message that the motivational program ‘Jeewithaya Aran’ wishes to convey. This program is the brainchild of Kasun Pushpakumara who is the presenter of this program. And Buddhika Ekanayaka is its star who shines brightly. Daily News met up with Pushpakumara who explained in detail what exactly this program is.
“This program is called ‘Jeewithaya Aran’ which is a motivational program which is music related.
This program is based on the life of Buddhika Ekanayaka, who will appear on this program wherever and whenever it takes place. Buddhika has no hands. He was born with this deformity. However he can do everything the rest of us can do. Even though he has no limbs, he can write, draw pictures, use a lap top, use the cell phone, send SMS, play the Octopad and the Keyboard. He has educated himself and even does his own business. This is because he believes that nothing is impossible,” said Pushpakumara.
This is the message of ‘Jeewithaya Aran’ that nothing is impossible if you have determination and will power. What you need is drive. Buddhika sings songs related to his disability while showing the audience in his programs what he can do without properly functioning limbs.
“If someone like Buddhika can do what he can do without limbs, then why can’t the rest of us overcome the obstacles we face in our life? What kind of a difference are we making in the world? We have successfully done this program in schools, tuition classes and institutes. Now we plan on playing at ‘Isurupaya’ auditorium.
We have also been invited to perform at Angunakolapelessa prison. We are doing this program free of charge because we sincerely want to promote the idea that nothing is impossible if you have the will power,” stated Pushpakumara
Pushpakumara pointed out that Buddhika has triumphed in life and that his mother loves him very much having wept over him.
“Buddhika even sings about this. Anyone who witnesses the performance can feel the pain and appreciate the strength of Buddhika. Anyone who sees this can appreciate the fact that you can accomplish anything you attempt. You just need to have faith in yourself. In this program Buddhika will show his prowess. At the Scholarship exam the cut out mark was 121. But Buddhika scored 149. So we tell little children that the reason they do not achieve is because they do not know that they can. Buddhika believes in himself which is why he can do what he does,” explained Pushpakumara.
This purpose of this program is to remove and destroy all self- doubt. With his will power Buddhika also has the talent. This too has played a part in his victory. He is a courageous person.
“Come and see our program and you will be amazed. Please call us on 071 909 606 7. And see our program transform lives,” added Pushpakumara.
