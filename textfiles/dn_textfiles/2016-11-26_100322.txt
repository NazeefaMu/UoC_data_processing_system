‘Voice of cricket’ Benaud gets face on new Aussie coin

SYDNEY Friday : The “voice of cricket” Richie Benaud has been honoured with his face on a 50-cent coin in Australia, with a limited mintage inspired by statistics from his storied career.
The former Australian Test captain and broadcaster, beloved by fans around the world for his peerless television commentary and his catchphrase “marvellous”, died in his sleep last year aged 84.
He played his last Test against South Africa in 1964 and the new coin was released to coincide with Australia’s third Test against the Proteas under way in Adelaide.
Royal Australian Mint’s chief executive Ross MacDiarmid said it was an honour to feature Benaud on the currency.
“The coin design commemorates his reputable career in the many layers, from the Australian cricket team captain to his renowned status in the commentary box,” he said. AFP
