Those rejected by people playing the ‘racist’ card: Range Bandara

Irrigation State Minister Palitha Range Bandara said yesterday the very forces who were rejected by the people and who spread communalism are now trying to pin the ‘racist’ card on this government.
“During the Rajapaksa regime,it was very evident how the government had tried to cover up its sins by using these racists as puppets. It was openly sponsoring racism by allegedly pumping money for racist activities. The BBS was backed by the former Defence Secretary,alleged Range Bandara.
State Engineering Cooperation funds had been allegedly misused to pay the hiring charges, fuel charges and driver’s salary for the vehicle used by an extremist group Rawana Balaya called the organisation.
“We lost a number of lives and properties during the Sinhala-Muslim riots and a 30-year war in the North. Everybody remembers how the entire country plunged into an utter chaos due to these struggles.
“Therefore,certain people are still trying to create chaos and anarchy again by creating racism due to due to ‘greed for wealth and power’. “Former Minister Wimal Weerawansa who was arrested for the allegedly misuse of 40 government vehicles causing a loss of about Rs.90 million has accused the government of inciting racism,” Range Bandara said.
He always blame the government when he was leaving the Courts premises after appearing for his case.
Range Bandara said that Weerawansa accuses the government of trying to create division among the people in order to gain the support of the Diaspora for the Constitutional Reforms.
“This is an utter lie and it is the Opposition that has been demanding for a new Constitution,” Range Bandara said.
“Today, the Constitutional Reforms are in the progress with the active support of all political parties in Parliament, where all communities represented,” he said.
“Weerawansa has accuesd the government of providing a safe house to hide Ven. Gunasara Thera. If he knows all this information, why does he not bring this to the notice of the relevant law enforcement authorities.If not, it is a violation of the law.
UNP Parliamentarian Mujibur Rahman said it was during former President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s era that Sri Lanka has seen an alleged rise in numerous racist and extremist movements. Details have emerged of how former Housing and Construction Minister Wimal Weerawansa had allegedly provided three vehicles to Convener of the Ravana Balaya Ven. Iththekande Saddhatissa Thera and allegedly misused State Engineering Corporation funds to pay the hiring charges for them.
“This is how he has allegedly acted in promoting racism powers,”Rahman said.
“A reason for the previous government to be defeated was due to the hate motivated incidents of terror and violence. That is why we wanted this government to take measures to prevent such incidents, and also to penalise those who disrupt law and order,” Rahman said.
“The Police have already arrested 14 people in this regard. Today,the government is moving towards reconciliation, rehabilitation and peaceful co-existence. At this juncture, it is clear that several elements are trying to sabotage the government’s work by create peaceful co-existence,”he added.
