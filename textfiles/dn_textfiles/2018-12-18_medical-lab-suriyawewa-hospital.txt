Medical lab for Suriyawewa Hospital

A medical laboratory has been set up at the Suriyawewa Base Hospital. This was an urgent necessity for the hospital as patients who need laboratory facilities had to go to distant hospitals incurring heavy expenditure due to lack of a laboratory at this hospital. DMO of the hospital Dr. Weerasinghe said that donors and philanthropists in the area contributed towards this meritorious task.
