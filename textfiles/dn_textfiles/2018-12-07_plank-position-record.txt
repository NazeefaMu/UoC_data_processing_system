Plank position record

A Bollywood star led 2,353 people in exercising their abs and holding the plank position for 60 seconds to break a Guinness World Record.
Actress and fitness expert Shilpa Shetty Kundra led the attempt Sunday at the Armed Forces Medical College in Pune and Guinness officials confirmed it surpassed the previous record of 1,779 people holding the plank position in China in March 2017.
The attempt was sponsored by the Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Company, which tweeted video from the event.
“Overtaking China was, in fact, a tremendous achievement and I’m extremely grateful for being one of the 2,353 people who could help in making this a reality.
I want to thank everyone for waking up this early on a Sunday morning as it has helped us create history,” the Hindustan Times quoted Kundra as saying at the event.
