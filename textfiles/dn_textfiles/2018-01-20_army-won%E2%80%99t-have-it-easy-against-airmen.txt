Army won’t have it easy against Airmen

Army Sports Club will face stiff resistance from the Sri Lanka Air Force sports Club in their Dialog ‘A’ Division League rugby second round match at Air Force grounds in Rathmalana today. Kick off will be at 4.00pm.
The Airmen went down fighting to CH and FC by 12-28 in the Dialog ‘A’ Division League rugby second round match at Race Course grounds last week.
This year they scored only a solitary win over the Police sports Club in the first Leg of the ongoing league tournerment and should give the soldiers a close run in today’s match.
Air Force have been bolstered by the inclusion of several talented ruggerites from Kandy schools. Former Vidyartha player Radeesha Seneviratne will bind down in the third row with Dimithri Patabandi and Saraka Weralla, while another Kandy school players in Medagedara brothers (Kingswood) and Thilina Bandara will play alongside each other in the pack. In the back division former Vidyartha and Sri Lanka player Charith Seneviratne will occupy the pivotal centres berth most probably with Anthonian Jehan Seelagama while the wings will be probably manned by Isipathanian Ranindu Padmasanka and Ishara Madushan.
Army SC played a somewhat of a dejected game against Havelock Sports Club in their last game at Havelock Park thus losing the game by 8-27 after a close fight in the first half where the score read 10 points to 8 in favour of Havies at half time. Hence they will have to carry out an improved performance if they hope to beat the Air Force outfit.
Incidentally the Army SC side that turn tables on Air Force SC in their first round outing winning by a stunning 33 points to 32 at Race Course grounds, their by will go all out to get an all important victory in this game as well.
