Point of view
Sri Lankan equities hit a 5-year low on Friday to close at 5761.09 points as it lost ~54 points (0.9% W-o-W) over the week. On Monday, the broad share Index fell below the psychological 5800-mark to 5774.37 and continued to trade below 5800-mark throughout the remainder of the week.
This week’s ~0.9% loss on the ASPI consequently dragged this year’s cumulative loss on Sri Lankan equities down to ~10%. Despite this, activity levels on the market improved during the week, with weekly turnover increasing ~181% W-o-W to Rs.4.4Bn from Rs.1.6Bn last week. On Monday, daily turnover hit an 11-week high of ~Rs.2.0Bn driven by a strategic transaction on Singer Sri Lanka by its current parent Hayleys.
Although Singer was trading below Rs.30.0, Hayleys Group (which already owns >80% of Singer) bought a further 9.47% (35,562,883 shares) at the notably higher price of Rs.47.0 (same as last year’s mandatory offer price). Subsequently, the average daily turnover on the Colombo Bourse increased to Rs.874Mn cf. just Rs.311Mn last week. Local HNI and Institutional investors meanwhile returned strongly to the market this week, with crossings over the week accounting for ~69% of total weekly turnover (cf. just 24% last week).
Large parcels of Singer (~55% of crossings) and JKH (~35%) accounted for the majority of the week’s total crossings. Meanwhile the foreign equity sell-off on Sri Lankan equities continued yet again this week, reflecting both broader global economic developments and continued concerns over the depreciation of the LKR.
The net foreign outflows from the Colombo bourse consequently increased to Rs.2.4Bn (including the Singer transaction of Rs.1.7Bn) cf. just Rs.0.5Bn last week. Although foreign investors recorded a net inflow of Rs.6.1Bn up until February 2018, foreign investors have since sold off Rs.15.4Bn between February to October, bringing the YTD foreign outflow from Sri Lankan equities to Rs.9.3Bn.Markets in the week ahead are likely to take cues from the beginning of the September’18 earnings season.
Manufacturing and service sector growth slows
Sri Lanka’s manufacturing and Services sector activities grew at a slower pace in September, with the leading Purchasing Managers Indicator (PMI) indicating slower growth during the month. Manufacturing Sector PMI fell to 54.1 points in September (cf. 58.2 points in August) amid a slowdown in new orders and production especially in the manufacturing of food and beverage. Despite remaining above the neutral 50-point mark, the PMI shrank to a 5-month low as employment also slowed down. Increased input costs of imported raw materials (due to the 11.6% YTD depreciation of the LKR) meanwhile led to an increase in prices of the manufactured products and resulted in decreased demand for new orders and production.
However, export driven segments such as manufacturing of textiles, wearing apparel and leather experienced an improvement in new orders and production. Sri Lanka’s Service Sector PMI meanwhile fell to 53.0 points in Sep’18 cf. 57.0 in Aug’18, its weakest since the survey began in May’15.
Though the index remained above the 50-point mark, which separates growth from contraction, the slowdown in the service sector was largely driven by slower business activity in accommodation, food & beverage, wholesale & retail trade, health activities and other personal services. The slowdown in import volumes and off-peak season in the Tourism sector also added to the decline in the Index.
Slower business activities also contributed to sluggish employment expansion in Sep’18 while new business growth eased across the financial services and insurance sectors. Meanwhile, Service providers’ outlook on the three months business activities strengthened, albeit at a slower pace, as higher fuel prices along with LKR depreciation and import restrictions impacted survey respondents adversely.
