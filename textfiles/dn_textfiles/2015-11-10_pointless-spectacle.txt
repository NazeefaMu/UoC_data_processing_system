Agora
Pointless spectacle

‘Sleepy’ is a term which best describes Alejandro Amenabar’s ‘Agora’. This bland epic centers around free thinkers in the ancient times. Set in Alexandria, ‘Agora’ opens to its protagonist, Hypatia, teaching science to a group of youth. The movie highlights her struggle to save the knowledge of the ancients and her attempt to remain neutral with her students who come from all walks of life: Jewish, Christian, and Pagan. ‘Agora’ also delves into heliocentric model of the universe.
‘Agora’ recounts the last days of Classical Antiquity in Roman Egypt. The movie unfurls just before Alexandria’s legendary library was destroyed. Despite the sad fact that much of Agora is, in some way or another, concerned with marauding Jesus freaks, their religious beliefs are ultimately a very prominent red herring. Religious differences necessarily lead to arbitrary conflicts, as in the way that members of the pagan gentry mock and eventually set out to lynch their Christian brothers before they themselves wind up being attacked by hordes of the feisty monotheists, who have the Roman government and army supporting them.
Romantic intrigue
The Alexandrian library was destroyed because nobody listened to reason, which in this case is conflated with science. The forces of unreason, in this case proto-crazy Christians, are to blame and the eggheads were right all along. Sadly, knowledge of Aristarchus’s heliocentric model of the galaxy doesn’t make Agora watchable.
Listless romantic intrigue is another feature in the movie. Though it adds some interest to the plot, our curiosity fades away quickly. It lacks the conviction needed in a movie of this nature where new theories come to light and science and morality come to the fore. Though the underlying message is that it is philosophy, not religion, which is the great communicator.
Confrontations with angry Christian mobs that stones Jews because the Good Book tells them to is though provoking to a certain extent. However that aspect too gets lost in the sequences that follow. Nobody heeds Hypatia’s sage advice except for her father and her suitor, Orestes. However Hypatia has little time for men. She ridicules Orestes while her other love interest, her slave Davus, is mocked too. She is too obsessed with trying to find the earth’s place in the universe. Davus is torn between his faith and his love for Hypatia. Hypatia forgives him for his transgression against her and frees him as a slave.
Plot strands
Amenábar’s camera swoops through a city in tumult, rendered with hand-built sets as well as CGI, as Hypatia and her students are drawn into the maelstrom. Some characters are too thin to tie up the plot strands.
As a result of this, the ending is nowhere near as powerful as it should have been. It is unfortunate that a talented actress like Rachel Weisz had not given much to do but look good in a toga. ‘Agora’ is high minded and ambitious. But it lacks the essence which is needed to make it an ace movie. Pointless!
