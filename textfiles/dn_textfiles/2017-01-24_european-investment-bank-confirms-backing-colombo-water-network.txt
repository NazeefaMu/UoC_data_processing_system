European Investment Bank confirms backing for Colombo water network

The European Investment Bank will provide EUR 50 million to support improvement and expansion of sewage networks in Colombo.
The new loan will help the Colombo Municipal Council to achieve its goal of providing full sanitation coverage to benefit people living and working in the greater Colombo area.
The loan is European Investment Bank’s first ever support for water investment in Sri Lanka and the first loan for public sector investment agreed with the government.
“The new support from the European Investment Bank will help unlock essential new investment to improve sanitation in Colombo. I look forward to strengthening cooperation between the EIB and Sri Lanka in the years to come,” Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake, following his meeting in Brussels with senior European Investment Bank officials responsible for lending in South Asia, said.
“Increased access to sanitation to be achieved by this project will improve the lives of thousands of people living in Colombo and contribute to achieve sustainable development goals in Sri Lanka.
“The European Investment Bank is pleased to be working closely with partners in Sri Lanka to ensure an environmentally sustainable future for the country’s capital and is grateful for the excellent cooperation with the Asian Development Bank in our first joint support in the country.
“The fruitful discussions with Ministers Karunanayake and Malik Samarawickrama have outlined how the EIB’s global experience can support new investment to improve lives and enhance opportunities in Sri Lanka,” European Investment Bank Vice President Andrew McDowell said.
