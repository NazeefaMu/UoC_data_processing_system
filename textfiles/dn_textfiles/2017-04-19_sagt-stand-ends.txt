SAGT stand-off ends

The near two week industrial action by the private container terminal, South Asia Gateway Terminals (SAGT), ended yesterday. The disruption caused the diversion of several vessels to the two other terminals in the port.
“Following 13 days of operational disruption at its berth, team SAGT made a ground breaking deal that brought a mutually satisfactory end to the stand-off,” SAGT chief executive, Erwin Haaze, said.
The company said it expects to be back to normal within 48 hours and normalise its berthing window protocols within this week.
“This agreement maintained the sanctity of the Collective Agreement (CA) signed just six months ago, yet enabled us to accomplish a sustainable outcome based on sensible principles of workforce engagement in a commercially responsible way,” said Chandana Wijayanama, SAGT’s General Manager for Human Resources.
“There is a collective determination by all involved to ensure disruption of this nature does not recur.
That is the most important achievement - to foster an environment conducive to delivering a reliable, consistent and sustainable “best in class” service level to our customers,” he said.
