President’s only wish a pure, unblemished transparent govt. : Isuru Devapriya

President Maithripala Sirisena has never instructed anyone to remove or cut the photographs of the former President, but the former President has instructed to do so after he became the President, Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya said.
Addressing a press conference held at the Western Provincial Council Auditorium yesterday, he said that the former President came for the 64th Anniversary of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), sat on a chair allocated for the Adviser and had a friendly chat with President Sirisena. The Party leadership was given to President Sirisena with the presence of some of the SLFP high rankers.
According to the Chief Minister, it was the SLFP which always saved the country whenever the UNP destroyed the country in the past. The people of Sri Lanka wanted a SLFP Government led by late Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike even before the UNP was formed.
There are documents to prove this fact. It was the SLFP which opened all factories in Sri Lanka, but today, it seems there are non of them existing.
The main target of the 66th Anniversary celebrations of the SLFP was to present policies that could win the younger generation. Present day youths could not be fooled by promising them bracelets or chocolates.
Speaking of corruption, malpractices, robberies and white vans could only change the leadership, but President Sirisena wants to establish a pure, unblemished and transparent Government, he added.
