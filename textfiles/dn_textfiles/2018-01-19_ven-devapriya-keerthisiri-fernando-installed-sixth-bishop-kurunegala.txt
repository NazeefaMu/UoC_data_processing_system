Ven. Devapriya Keerthisiri Fernando installed as sixth Bishop of Kurunegala

Lord Bishop of Colombo, Rt. Rev. Dhiloraj Canagasabey and Bishop Emeritus Rt. Rev. Kenneth Fernando installed Ven. Keerthisiri Fernando as the sixth Bishop of Kurunegala at a colourful ceremony at Christ the King Cathedral amidst a large representative crowd of faithful and distinguished gathering that included several bishops from abroad. Several other religious leaders too were present to wish him well.
So, we have two radiant bishops currently from the seat of priestly dominance which is Moratuwa with the enthronement of Bishop Devapriya Keerthisiri Fernando and Roman Catholic Bishop Valence Mendis from the Diocese of Chilaw, who are both scholars chosen by God to guide His flock to greener pastures.
The newly consecrated Bishop is very humane, brimming with simplicity and one who is able to reach the poor and humble; keeping with the example set by Jesus, removed from pomp and pageantry.
Chief Sanganayake of the Salpitikorale Ven. Mahagalkadawala Punnasara Nayake Thera wishing the newly elected Bishop
He has absolutely no qualms about his mission as a crusader for the Lord. What he was as a priest, he will be as a Bishop without withdrawing from different classes of people. Like our own Bishop Delo Canagasabey to whom every single person, Christian or not, matters on equal terms with no barrier built around him. Bishop Keerthisiri will draw his inspiration from him.
I know for sure nothing is ever going to spoil or distract his sacred mission. Having an excellent rapport with all other religious leaders and their followers, Bishop Keerthisiri has the spiritual power to bring everyone onto to one platform of peace, unity and love.
The ability to co-ordinate with one and all and make all feel the same in the presence of God, is mightier than the sword in hand.
Early life
Born to believing Christian parents who nurtured him towards a brilliant academic career of his choice, they were rewarded with the 'Prince of peace' when they found their wondrous son had decided to dedicate his life to God. He commenced schooling at Prince of Wales College, Moratuwa, never imagining it was the foundation laid for his spiritual career.
The excellent education and spiritual background that lay within the portals of this magnificent school was the primary backing to what lay ahead in serving God.
Eminent scholar
With schooling done, he entered the Theological College of Lanka at Pilimatalawa. Still later, he was reading for the Bachelor of Engineering in England in the year 1985 with a vision of being an engineer. This was followed by the double M. Phil. qualification in Sri Lanka reading for his Ph.D.
The engineering field in Sri Lanka lost an eminent Engineer while God's pathway gained much for His sheep. Bishop Keerthisiri had absolutely no hesitation in choosing the right one.
Therefore, the elevation of Devapriya Keerthisiri Fernando as the sixth Bishop of Kurunegala was a blessing from above for someone who as a deacon in 1989 rose to such heights in a span of few years. That is how God rewards his chosen children.
What he gave the Christian world
When he preached of the limits and infinite intensity of the Christian heart and attempted to explore that which is spiritual that cannot be described to precision, he turns spiritual because there is something of an urgency in the scriptures to fulfill God's highest purposes and ever since he pledged his life for God, Bishop Keerthisiri's heart was filled with the incredible truth from God's Word.
He was ordained the arch-deacon of Nuwara Eliya and continued his services while being attached to the Department of the Education Ministry, being a member of the Advisory Board which compiled Christianity textbooks.
He was also Chaplain at Hillwood College, Kandy, Theological College of Lanka and the Denipitiya Missionary Medical Institute, among many others.
