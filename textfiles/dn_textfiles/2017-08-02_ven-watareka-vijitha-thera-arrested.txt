Ven. Watareka Vijitha Thera arrested

Ven. Watareka Vijitha Thera was arrested by Fort Police for having behaved in an unruly manner outside the Presidential Secretariat.
The Police Media Unit said the Thera was arrested yesterday afternoon, but was admitted to Colombo National Hospital due to health conditions.
The Thera who is under police custody is the General Secretary of the Jathika Bala Sena organisation. In 2014, he was arrested for lodging a false complaint with Police. At the time, the Bhikku Order he belonged to, the Mahiyangana Sama Sri Sangha Council issued an order suspending him from participating in any religious event.
