C.E.M. PONNIAH

He was a Cambridge Blue in cricket who participated in the Oxford Cambridge match at Lord’s three times. He obtained two degrees at Cambridge University, in Engineering and Architecture.
Although he came from a privileged background Mano Ponniah was humble as ever. He was soft spoken and gentle and I interviewed him at his Colombo 7 office.
He was a product of S Thomas’ Mount Lavinia. Mano was coached by the famous Lassie Abeywardene. His contemporaries at the school by the sea were Lareef Idroos, Michael Sproule, Gamini Marapana and Keith Labrooy. In Mano’s first Royal- Thomian match he opened the batting with Gamini Marapona. He scored a boring 50 stated Mano. He was selected to represent Colombo South which was a strong side.
He got into the University of Ceylon, it was the height of university sport in the early sixties stressed Mano. They had a strong university side and in his second year captained by Carlyle Perera the side included Lareef Idroos, Cyril Ernest, Buddy Reid, Mohanlal Fernando and Sivananthan won the Sara Trophy in 1962. That was a young team that gelled together well. Mohanlal Fernando an outstanding all-rounder opened the bowling with Harsha Samarajeewa and the spin twins were Lareef Idroos and Cyril Ernest. They managed to beat all the famous teams such as SSC, NCC, Colts and so on. There were six medical students in the cricket team.
Buddy Reid and Mano were the outstanding batsmen at the university and they were selected to play for Ceylon in the Gopalan Trophy match against Tamil Nadu. Mano and Buddy were again in the team against the visiting Australians led by Bobby Simpson. Mano scored a laboured 64 in that match.
Mano recalled that both he and Buddy Reid were stodgy batsman who were technically excellent. Thereafter it was Pakistan they played against and Michael Tissera was the captain since C.I. Gunasekera had retired. They beat the Pakistani’s and Mano opened batting with T.C.T. Edwards another Thomian who was flamboyant. There were 7 Thomians in that team that included Buddy Reid, Michael Tissera, Lareef Idroos, Neil Chanmugam and P.I. Peiris. Mano recalled that the Ceylon team then had struck a purple patch. There was another trip to India. Ceylon lost two Test matches and won in Ahmedabad. By now Mano was more interested in his cricket than studies. Mano noted that he was obsessed with cricket and he wanted somehow to balance his studies and cricket. He was eyeing to play for Cambridge because the prestigious Universities like Oxford and Cambridge were the nurseries for budding international cricketers.
He mentioned a few famous names that walked the portals of these two universities like the Nawab of Pataudi, Javed Burki, Gamini Goonesena, Peter May, Colin Cowdrey and Imran Khan and the list goes on. They were all well to do.
Mano was fortunate to join Cambridge to study architecture mainly due to his international exposure in playing for Ceylon. Gamini Goonesena was also at Cambridge before him reading Estate Management.
Mano played with Vijaya Malalasekera who was a flamboyant cricketer and Mano recalled that he was a more serious cricketer. Vijay’s father was our Ambassador in London, G.P. Malalasekera. Vijaya joined Cambridge one year before Mano and played under Derek Murray the West Indies wicket keeper.
During this period Clive Inman and Stanley Jayasinghe were entertaining the crowds in the county scene and Mano noted that their cavalier approach to batting was home made from Ceylon those days. Stanley Jayasinghe came back to Sri Lanka and contributed immensely to Sri Lanka cricket but Mano noted that Clive unfortunately was never heard since he had faded away thereafter.
Cambridge Blue Mano played some memorable knocks and one was against Middlesex a 90 and the other was an unbeaten century against Hampshire. He notched 800 odd runs for Cambridge in one season and he was earmarked for the aborted tour to England.
Mano was perplexed when the tour was aborted and he was unaware of the dealings back home. However Mano stated that Dhanasiri Weerasinghe and H.I.K. Fernando had become the selectors and Dhanasiri being the chairman there were some disagreements.
When Mano represented Ceylon against India they were paid Rs 50 a day and Mano said without any malice that now the boys are getting big bucks.
Mano never played club cricket in Ceylon even when he got back he was working for his charter both as an engineer and as an architect.
He mentioned that he had played several times for the MCC and has been an MCC member for 50 years. For the tsunami match the MCC gave one million dollars for the Tsunami fund and Mano was a trustee for them. He did some work for Kushil Gunasekera’s Foundation of Goodness, as an architect in Killinochchi.
Mano is disappointed about Sri Lanka losing to teams such as Afghanistan and Bangladesh. He was of the opinion that cricket has been diluted with many teams below par playing in the top tournament.
On the contrary he was emphatic that exposure should be given to talented players in the age group of 19 to 24 where they are malleable to change their technique.
Mano has two sons living in U.K. and one is a banker and the other is into H.R. His wife spends six months in U.K. and 6 months in Sri Lanka with Mano. He said that he prefers to stay in Sri Lanka, where he is a much sought after architect.
