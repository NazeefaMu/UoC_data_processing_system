Road development project launched

A road development project was launched in Addalaichenai, recently. Parliamentarian A.L.M. Nazeer has launched a number of such projects in Addalaichenai, Oluvil and Palamunai and many of them are expected to be completed by year's end.
The Kithur Mohamed Road, Boundary Channel Road, as well as internal roads in Kinniyadi are some of the roads that would be renovated under the projects. Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) Leader Ruff Hakeem has allocated funds for the project at the request of Parliamentarian A.L.M. Nazeer.
