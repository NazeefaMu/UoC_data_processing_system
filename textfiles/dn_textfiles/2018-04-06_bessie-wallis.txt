Bessie Wallis

Bessie Wallis Warfield Simpson was the twice-divorced socialite from Baltimore whose love affair with King Edward VIII triggered a constitutional crisis for the British monarchy in the 1930s.
They met when he was still Prince of Wales, through a tangled web involving one of his mistresses.
He fell hard, becoming the first British monarch to voluntarily give up the throne, on December 10, 1936, before her second divorce was finalized and less than a year into his reign.
Her marital status and his role as head of the Church of England were insurmountable at the time.
The two became the Duke and Duchess of Windsor after they married nearly three years after they met, on June 3, 1937, settling into exile in France and elsewhere.
He did perform some official duties, for instance during World War II as governor of the Bahamas There was a visit to Germany with an Adolf Hitler photo op and outrage that they were Nazi sympathizers.
