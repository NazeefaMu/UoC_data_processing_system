N*Able wins Digital Transformation Award at Microsoft Partner Awards

N*Able, a prominent entity in Sri Lanka’s technological landscape, took home the award for Digital Transformation at the Microsoft South East Asia New Markets Partner Summit held from September 10-12 2017, in Bangkok, Thailand.
The accolade which was awarded under the category of South-East Asia – Emerging Markets, was a clear distinction of the company’s recent success in migrating a major organisation’s operations to the Microsoft SQL database.
Spanning over a decade of experience in the industry, N*Able’s achievement is one that further cements its status as a leader amongst its peers.
One of the determining factors for the win, was the level of value addition that the client was able to enjoy as a result of the crossover to SQL.
Aside from their day-to-day operations, the client is also now running their critical business applications via the database server software, which has resulted in a significant improvement in efficiency.
With this customer need in mind, N*Able has built a dedicated team to implement the entire Microsoft solution stack, and has deployed multiple large solutions with Microsoft technologies.
‘I congratulate N*Able for this significant recognition at this year's Southeast Asia New Markets Partner Summit as the Digital Transformation award winner for Sri Lanka’, said Hasitha Abeywardena, Country Manager for Microsoft Sri Lanka and Maldives.
This is a testimony to the relentless commitment of N*Able to deliver transformative solutions to customers, using the cutting-edge technology platforms provided by Microsoft’.
