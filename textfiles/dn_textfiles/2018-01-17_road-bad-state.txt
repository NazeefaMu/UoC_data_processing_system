Road in bad state

The Gangeyaaya road in the Veraganthota area of the Minipe Yodha Ela Irrigation Zone, has been in a deplorable condition for a long time.
Running parallel to the Mahaweli river and through a few hamlets, this ring road between Paalam Handiya and Millaththeva Handiya (earlier Sevala Bokkuva area) on the Mahiyanganaya-Minipe-Hasalaka road has been damaged by heavy vehicles carrying sand from the Mahaweli river, locals say.
