Agreement on main policies needed

There is turmoil in the country, in the political arena. As far as the new constitution is concerned they have appointed six sub committees and a main committee. Reports have come from these sub committees. But in the constitution making, it appears that everything has come to a standstill. Two years have passed but still there are doubts about the new constitution and the devolution of power as the solution to the Tamil national problem. Yet, people have their hopes with the government.
There are so many practical problems in making a Yahapalanaya reality, which people can understand. At the same time they have some suspicion that high ups in the new government are interfering in certain investigations which are going on. They believe that there are deals with the Mahinda groups. They want politicians to keep away from those investigations so that justice can be meted out very soon. That is what the pro government people expect from the government. They hate to see the government doing things in an extremely arbitrary manner.
Development strategy
When there is a lot of criticism about the development strategy, leaders are not ready to discuss them. They say that the government is not willing to listen to the people who brought this government into power. However they say “Toppling the government is not possible because constitutionally you need to win the support of the majority in parliament. Therefore we don’t see any big obstacle for them to continue until the next election.”
However they agree that the government is now not popular among the populace. “They are not popular among the Southern Sinhala Buddhist constituency. The Tamils in the North, though not so happy, don’t mind this government in power because they can’t afford to create a situation where the Rajapaksas come back.” Many believe that the government is still at an advantage as its dissenting forces are divided. But the demerits of the government, they say that the people involved in corruption and who were holding high authority were not penalized, but were instead retained in office.
Social political reforms
Many complain “The government does not have a good communication strategy. So the positive actions they take are not communicated to the public. Most private media are not favouring the government. They were linked very closely to the previous regime and they continue to support them.” Since the government is a coalition of two main parties’ positives and negatives will have to be experienced.
But there should be agreement on the main policies. It is natural that in both sides there are people who want to have their own government instead of a coalition. That is seen in many aspects. However the President and Prime Minister should be committed to push the main social political reforms together. But that is not seen in the recent period. For example, Land and Police powers should be given to the people of the Northern Province, and in general to all provincial governments. But still there is no general commitment within the government.
MP Athuraliye Rathana Thera said recently “We, too, agree on giving Land and Police powers to the Northern community. A national policy should be adopted before the lands are given, as the poor deserve the lands, not the politicians nor any other wealthy men who claim them,” he said.
He also said that the armed forces should be kept under the Central Government and administrative powers could easily be transferred to the North. “Instead of the khaki uniformed colonialist police personnel in High Security Zones, we could simply deploy police officers clad in white uniforms in the Northern areas without firearms. The war is over. Therefore we can give the Tamil people a police force with civil administrative powers,” he said.
In the mean time the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) recently threatened to resort to major trade union action if the committee appointed by President Maithripala Sirisena to probe the SAITM issue does not give its final decision within one week.
GMOA Media Spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda told a media briefing that the GMOA took this decision following a unanimous approval of its Central Committee. He said they also decided to make a written complaint to the President against what they called the political-insanity of Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne, Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella and former Higher Education Minister S. B. Dissanayake on this issue.
Private medical education
He added that they were expecting a justifiable decision on the questioned-standards of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) in Malambe from the committee appointed by the President.
He said the Health Ministry and the Higher Education Ministry still hold the responsibility of the medical education’s standards and stressed that the SAITM was not an institute that has been accepted by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC). This is an improvement, because earlier they were speaking on private medical education, irrespective of standards. However they did not protest about the medical college at Kotalawala Defence University, which sells education, similar to SAITM. In reality this protest is motivated by Sinhala Buddhist hegemony in education rather than anti private education.
In 88/89 period, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), at the time led by late Rohana Wijeweera, launched a pitiless attack on the NCMC since its inception. Wijeweera had the full support of the chauvinist political parties in Sri Lanka at the time and this issue of the NCMC was a sharp weapon in his hand and Wijeweera used it in his failed attempt to topple the government. Though this time JVP is not involved, breakaway group is using chauvinist mobilization in the present anti government struggle. Hence our democratic revolution too, is closely connected to the national problem.
In fact Russian revolution is a revolution of nationalities. The main problem that separated Bolsheviks from others is the national problem. Hence it is not an over simplification. The greatest contribution of Lenin in this period is his interpretation of imperialism, no doubt. However, in relation to the Russian revolution, most valuable is his thesis on national problem. Same is true for Lankan revolution too.
