Dengue vaccine import after evaluation

A vaccine for dengue will be imported once the National Medical Regulatory Authority issues the evaluation report on the vaccine, Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Rajitha Senarathne said.
When the minister was asked the progress of the process of introducing a dengue prevention vaccine, he said that the ministry is looking forward the evaluation report of the NMRA in connection with the vaccine manufactured in France.
After receiving the evaluation report, the vaccine will be imported through a suitable importer, he said.
