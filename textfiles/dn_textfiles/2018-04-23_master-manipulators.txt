MASTER MANIPULATORS!

Emotional blackmail is an issue far more prevalent than most people realise. What it actually entails is psychological manipulation which is a very common occurrence in varied relationships. Basically the perpetrator suffers from a personality disorder.
All the same some are darned skilful at it. These are the ‘Master Manipulators’ who love to indulge in mind games. They actually prey upon the emotions and sensibilities of another for personal gain. This form of mental ‘extortion’ usually occurs within close relationships such as with parents and children, husbands and wives, lovers, colleagues or others with closely developed intimate ties. Emotional blackmail basically is the use of fear, obligation and guilt to control another person. These mind-benders are shrewder than many imagine. No, they do not get on your nerves initially. But once they win your trust they can turn your life into a living nightmare. What they really do is control your mind by making you feel guilty and selfish. They then keep up the pressure to bleed you white.
Yet several among us are victims of emotional blackmail and do not even realise it. In essence, the emotional blackmailer attempts to hold others responsible for how hurt he or she will feel if they do not give in to their demands. People who use emotional blackmail are those who wish to control others to ensure their own selfish ends. They are what one would call ‘mind-control freaks.’
Usually victims who are susceptible to this extortionist type of behaviour are considerate individuals who do not want to appear selfish or uncaring. They are also sensitive to criticism. The upshot of handling such a problem is that they usually end up being stressed out. Under anxiety from emotional blackmail, one may become a sort of hostage, compelled to act under pressure of the threat of responsibility for the other’s breakdown.
We all know that such irrational demands start with kids at a very young age. Observe how they constantly have their way by faking a tearless cry where the eye muscles don’t even twitch. Many parents fall for it every time. The children as a rule crave for something desirable and often expensive and keep assailing you with their unreasonable claim without letup. Mostly their unjust clamorous needling sends parents up against the wall. Everyone is made miserable when such unrealistic expectations cannot be met.
But the spoiled tykes do realise that persistent pestering power often works like magic. Children can be single-mindedly ruthless in pushing for what they want considering it a notion of entitlement. They wear down parents with so much constant nagging that they eventually give in and purchase the desired item.
They can become so infuriatingly bossy and push their peers around with the air reminiscent of midget tyrants. And yes, when things don’t go the way they expect they simply can’t stomach it. They find the disappointment too much to take and often make typical angry outbursts such as: “It’s not fair!” But the key to getting round these high-demand brats is to delve deeper into their little minds.
These children are crying out for understanding, affection, praise, and acceptance even when they know they are being unreasonable. They are under the mistaken belief that everyone else around them exist to make them feel happy. They feel there is never enough to fill their egoistic worlds even when people bend over backwards to cater to their most irrationally demanding whims.
More worryingly these kids with their demanding ways will continue such manipulative tactics well into adulthood. But hold on a bit and you will realise that parents are not the only victims here. Press the fast-forward button that takes you many years into their adulthood. And you will observe that several parents will whip out any excuse in order to keep that kid nicely attached to their apron strings.
Emotional blackmail is not confined to any particular groups or gender and can occur across all ages. Parents use it on children, children use it on parents and even grandparents often enter the picture with their opinions. One parent may even use it on the other.
Threats often show up as emotional or behaviour-based. Such threats are those where the blackmailer uses an emotional state to control the victim. This commonly occurs through rage, screaming, crying, whining or complaining.
Through making the situation uncomfortable enough, they force the victim to do something they are unwilling to. When this occurs in public places, embarrassment adds pressure for the target to yield. After several episodes of emotional threats, the victim often gives in to avoid the very possibility of another scene. The very threat of emotional discomfort or blackmail creates pressure to give in.
Self-harm and suicide threats are among the most terrifying and effective manipulative tactics in an abuser’s arsenal. One extreme form of emotional blackmail is abusers’ threats to kill themselves if their demands are not met. This is a below-the-belt blow, but often an effective strategy because it taps directly into our compassion for another human being, and our fear of being the cause of them ending their life.
The only way to combat such extortive demands is to understand that you are not responsible for the choices of another. Giving in to blackmail tactics even terrifying, dire threats such as suicide reinforces the blackmailing behaviour to a point of desperation. Not all people who threaten suicide do go on to take their own lives. But here is the bottom line: Whether he or she does or does not, you cannot be held responsible. The responsibility lies entirely with them for their own actions.
People who use emotional blackmail at work or in relationships do not usually start off using that form of communication. More often than not, the new relationship starts off as quite wonderful, warm and hopeful for a mutually beneficial alliance. In intimate relationships, the depth of emotional connection is very alluring. When the blackmail begins to happen, the victim does not see it as part of the regular relationship but rather as something outside of the norm. They convince themselves it is temporary. When women get involved in abusive relationships, this slow introduction of emotional blackmail is how they become battered women.
It is important to remember that you cannot change a manipulative person’s behaviour; only he or she can do that for themselves. But as in any blackmail transaction it takes two to tango. And you don’t have to keep in step to the blackmailer’s beat. Following enlightenment comes change. It’s easy to focus on other people’s behaviour and to think that if they change, things will be fine. Not so! The change has to begin with the blackmail target.
In a nutshell, emotional blackmail is a psychological-emotional ransom note that says, “if you don’t do what I want then I will make you hurt”. [email protected]
