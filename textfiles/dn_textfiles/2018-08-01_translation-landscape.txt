On the  translation  landscape

My purpose here is to spotlight on aspects of Translation gleaned from an essay by the Chief Editor of Illuminati, Dr Neeru Tandon, from the latest issue. There are very few translators of creative writing in our country. Speaking of Lankan Tamil Literature, I notice there is hardly anyone that can translate a novel, for instance from Tamil to English or vice a versa.
However, there are few works translated from Sinhala to Tamil and only one or two from Tamil to Sinhala.
The reason is people highly proficient in both Sinhala and Tamil to understand the nuances of both language and their attendant nuances are absent in the country. But there are many that have been translated from other languages into Sinhala and a few from Sinhala into English. But none from Tamil to English, none from English to Tamil s far as Lankan Tamil Literature is concerned.In this context, let’s see what academic, associate professor Neeru Tandon has got to say about translation in general.
“Translation of literary works is a specific subdivision of literature that allocates not merely words in other language or tries to convey literary terminologies or linguistic structures conforming to the language of the original work in the language being translated into. But its major involvement and aim is to transfer aesthetic, cultural, psychological and historical perceptions and conception from one language into another.
Translation is sensitive as it has a burden to translate one culture and a particular way of living into another in order to accomplish the levels of meanings of a given text in the target language, without distorting the original beauty and spirit of the text.” She reminds at the outset what Robert Pinsky has said in the article published 12 years ago in Literary Review:
“Translation is the only art that is like writing…It is also the highest, most intense form of reading, yet translation is almost by definition the most imperfect of arts of more than any other form of writing risks self-delusion.”
Tandon continues:
“Translation gives a message that all reding is, in fact deconstructive.
One actually recreates a new text in the process of translation. A good translator reads between the lines to ascertain a new meaning and deals with the questions like:
who can translate and for whom? Which text or genre to translate? Who is the reader? How are the readers going to accept it? How should one translate? How to deal with a text in translation? And finally, _ Is unlearning obligatory?
Answers to these questions must take care of a larger question whether we translate to construct a national, literary and cultural landscape or to patronize, appropriate, marginalize or destroy the culture and beauty of the source language.”
On the business of translation, let’s take some more excerpts from the same source. Here is one on Machine Translation:
Shubhangi Tandon writes:
“Machine Translation, quite literally means that a machine does translation from one language to another for you. If you’re a netizen of the cyber world, chances are you have used a product of Machine Translation one time or the other.”
Let me say about my own experience in using the machine for translations. I am not familiar with the Tamil keyboard and neither I can type in Tamil. Even in English, I type slowly. It’s a one finger exercise. So, when my F B friends chat with me in Tamil only, I reply using the English letters to substitute the Tamil letters. But this was not satisfactory. So, I sought the assistance of Google Tamil Transliteration. But that was not suitable for me, because it had a split window screen which was confusing me.
So, I looked for a more convenient apparatus in Kandupidi. I use this to translate my ideas in English into Tamil using English letters which turn into Tamil letters and form words. Since I am well versed in my mother tongue and English, the communication is just right to suit different structures and cultural observances.
