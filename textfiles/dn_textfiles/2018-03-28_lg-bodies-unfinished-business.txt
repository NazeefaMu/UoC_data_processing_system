LG Bodies: An unfinished business

The good men of the Good Governance government will have to consider various obstacles before developing the nation. They include political interference, additional cost and political influence. The general public needs to ascertain just and fair attention on utilizing public funds to meet the community needs without misappropriation.
The general public entertains diverse opinions on ongoing functions of local government authorities and their existing management. Perhaps it is opportune to determine how effective certain measures could be improved with, or without political interference through elections. Over one and half years, the municipal and urban councils, and pradeshiya sabhas functioned without political interference.
Following great effort and time framework of regulation of terms and conditions laid down by the respective ministerial authorities, the local government elections were held in February 2018. But still, it remains a question as some areas are supposed to commence the functions of respective authorities with the newly elected members. This will put an end to various problems within the respective political parties. Through media, we come across confusions of the political parties.
Provincial council administration
With all those commotions, whatever said and done, the local authorities used to function as usual with approved statutes and regulation through secretaries appointed with the permanent staff - either commissioner, state management service (supra grade or class I officers). This was under the guidance of the provincial council administration without much complication and other overhead expenditures such as emoluments and various allowances like fuel, maintenance of vehicles for council members, meetings and relevant expenses.
With the appointment of council members, there will be a change of administrative role. The commissioners and secretaries who run the present administration will have to hand over that power to the appointed political heads. This is where the political interference begins with the office staff and decisions taken on certain routine matters. This may or may not affect beyond the rules and regulations based on the academic and experiences of the appointed members.
As per media information, many instances of corruption and fund-misappropriation have occurred before dissolving the previous authorities. The corruptions and misappropriations of government funds on procurement, procedures and other relative development work for the benefit of the communities has become something inevitable. Besides, whatever work involved at local authorities, implementing the accepted procedures to scrutinize any submissions received from the general public by entrusted the respective officers qualified special areas in the local authorities (administrative, technical, engineering, valuation, health, construction, waste management, water supply, and other community services) is essential.
Political supporters
We must go back more than five decades and observe how the functions were carried out at Gam Sabha offices with local appointed staff with Gam Muladani system. Now there are more academically qualified personnel. We must make use of their services to fulfil the tasks of the local authorities instead of political movement. At this point, the appointment of political operators for local authorities seems to be in nursery stages.
Costing is a vital factor in local governance. The regulations need to be followed on the local government level by considering the economic situation of the country. The general public should be given a free hand to walk into any local government office without any disturbance. If the public had to approach the council members through political supporters, lackeys and brokers that situation has to change now. The council members should be more approachable to get the work done.
Time is now ripening to consider and come out with necessary suggestions. The respective authorities must step into a progressive way to offer a peaceful and uninterrupted service.
