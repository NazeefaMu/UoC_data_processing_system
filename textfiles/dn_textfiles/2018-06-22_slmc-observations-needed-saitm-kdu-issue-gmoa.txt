SLMC observations needed on  SAITM - KDU issue - GMOA

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) said observations of the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) are needed on basic educational qualifications of SAITM students to be absorbed to the Kotelawala Defence University (KDU). GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said that accordingly SAITM students who obtain the KDU medical degree should be able to register themselves with the SLMC. Dr. Aluthge said the Higher Education Minister should issue the gazette notification abolishing the SAITM Medical Degree as promised.
Immediate steps should be taken to pass the Minimum Standards of Medical Education prepared by the SLMC in Parliament and gazette them, he said.
There should be an exact time frame in absorbing qualified SAITM students to the KDU, he added.
