Hameedia’s ‘Refresh your Wardrobe’ campaign

“To be sartorially smart, every Sri Lankan man should refresh and re-invest in his wardrobe every few years,” celebrity fashion stylist and Managing Director of Hameedia, Fouzul Hameed said.
He advises that spending judiciously on a few on-point items that complement and rejuvenate what one already has, requires a keen eye for shifting proportions and accessories, as well as a clear view of what suits one’s body and profile.
“It is thus every man’s responsibility to refresh his wardrobe. We are going a step further and making it easier for young men out there to give away their old clothes which are in good condition and avail themselves of a redeemable voucher which they can use to purchase clothes at any of our stores islandwide” he said.
Aptly named ‘Refresh your Wardrobe’ the campaign is currently operative at all Hameedia branches across the country. Customers will receive a Rs. 100/- redeemable voucher each for every shirt (long sleeved and short sleeved) pair of trousers and pair of shoes traded in. All items need to be clean and in wearable condition, segregated and packed separately and tagged as follows - male, female, children.
All clothes taken in by Hameedia will be given to charity and thus bring a smile on the faces of the less fortunate. “We hope that through this endeavor not only will Sri Lankans be able to re-invest in and thus refresh their wardrobes but also be part of a charitable initiative that will touch the lives of a few thousand people islandwide”, he said.
The Hameedia Group pays undivided attention to providing for the less fortunate around and making a significant difference in their lives. So also is Hameedia’s principal CSR project ‘My Friend’ (www.myfriend.lk) which, since 2013, has been bringing about a tangible change in lives of little children around us.
“These children are our future. They need to be fed, clothed and educated. It is our duty to lend a helping hand to the less fortunate around us and make this world a better place. That what the ‘My Friend’ Project is all about”, Hameed added.
