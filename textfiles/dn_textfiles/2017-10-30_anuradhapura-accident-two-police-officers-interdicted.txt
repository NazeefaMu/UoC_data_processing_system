Anuradhapura accident : Two police officers interdicted

Two police officers involved in an accident that killed two graduate sisters in Anuradhapura were interdicted, Police Media Spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara yesterday said.
SP Gunasekara said a special investigation into the conduct of the two police officers was going on.
The two police officers were chasing a lorry when it hit the motorcycle. “The two officers had turned their police vehicle when they witnessed the accident.
The investigators are also looking into the reason why these two officers were chasing the lorry,” Gunasekara said. The deceased were Jayani Swetha Jayakodi (32) and Samadhi Navodya Jayakodi (29) from Nochchiyagama, Anuradhapura. They were attached to the Public Service, one at the Audit Division of the North Central Health Ministry and the other at the Ambagahawewa Vidayalaya, Nochchiyagama. The lorry was transporting cattle and hit head on with a motorcycle the two sisters were travelling for work. They succumbed to their injuries after they were admitted to the Anuradhapura Hospital.
