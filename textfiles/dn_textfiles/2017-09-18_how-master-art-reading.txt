How to master the art of reading

Believe it or not, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie—acclaimed novelist, famous feminist, certified genius—turns 40 today. In recent years, Adichie has become an international authority on feminism, and her TEDx talk “We should all be feminists” and the resulting book version have become so iconic that the sloganized title is gracing t-shirts everywhere these days. (Some of those t-shirts are made by Dior, and the whole designer feminist t-shirt thing is a complex issue that I won’t get into here, but remember that buying things does not actually make you more feminist.)
But while I am grateful for Adichie’s perspectives on feminism and her compelling arguments that we should raise boys and girls the same, and though I love and have taught We Should All Be Feminists, I sometimes get the feeling that in all the commotion people forget the fact that Adichie is, before all else, a fantastic writer of fiction. This isn’t so unusual for writers of color or anyone else who can be asked questions about identity rather than craft, but at the very least, I’d like her to be recognized as much for her contributions to contemporary literature as for her contributions to contemporary feminist discourse. So today, for her birthday, I spent some time reading (and listening to) Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie on her writing process, what she values in literature, and her advice for aspiring writers. Highlights below.
On reading to learn:
“[I tell aspiring writers in my workshops] to read and read and read. I’m a believer in reading, to see the wide range of what’s been written. I’m also a believer in reading what you dislike at least once, just to know. I often say to my students, “I’m going to have you read something I don’t like.” I don’t like cold fiction. I don’t like fiction that is an experiment. I find that often it’s the boys in the class who love the fiction I don’t like. I say to them, “I’ll tell you why I don’t like it. And, then, if you like it, I want you to tell me why.” Most of all I believe in reading for what you can learn in terms of not just craft and technique but worldview. It’s important to think about sentences and how one develops character and all of that, but also to think about what the story is as a big thing. Most of all, we have fun in the workshops. For me, it’s important that we find reasons to laugh. And we mostly do.” –from an interview in Image
“Read, read, read. I’m not sure that one can be a good writer without being a good reader. If you’re going to build a desk it’s very good to see what other carpenters have done.” –from an interview with the Stylist Book Club
On writing from life:
“I have many writer friends who get offended when they’re asked about the story behind the story. I don’t. Imagination doesn’t fall from the sky; you have to work with something. My fiction borrows from my life, but even more so from the lives of other people. And because I write realistic fiction, it doesn’t fall from the sky. I don’t feel threatened when I’m asked that.” –from an interview in Salon
“Sometimes a character just forms in my head; other times a character is based on somebody real (although the character often ends up being quite different from the “real” person). Ifemelu is a more interesting version of me. Both Ifemelu and Obinze are me, really. . . . I think I have Ifemelu’s questioning nature, Obinze’s longing. Like them, I’m always looking to learn. A bit of a romantic, but I hide it well.” –from an interview with Parul Sehgal at Tin House
On why the love story in Americanah is not a “descent”:
“I don’t even accept the premise. It’s not as though I set out to destroy something that I didn’t agree with. I didn’t agree with it in the first place. I don’t much care about these distinctions between, for example, literary and genre. I read what I find interesting. It’s also very interesting, isn’t it, that when a woman writes a love story, it’s a love story. But when a man writes a love story . . .
But yeah, I love the love story, I wanted to do that very much. But it’s a love story that’s very much rooted in reality. It’s the kind of love story where your inability to get a visa gets in the way of love. I loved the ending, for example, which I hoped would annoy some people. It’s always a good thing to annoy some people. But here’s the thing: the ending is me thinking, “You know what? I want to have this lush, ridiculous thing happen, and it’s going to happen!” –from an interview in Salon
On (not) writing to prove something:
“I don’t start out writing to challenge stereotypes. I think that can be as dangerous as starting out to “prove” stereotypes. And I say “dangerous” because fiction that starts off that way often ends up being contrived, burdened by its mission. I do think that simply writing in an emotionally truthful way automatically challenges the single story because it humanizes and complicates. And my constant reminder to myself is to be truthful.” –from an interview with Parul Sehgal at Tin House
On the difference between writing short stories and writing novels:
“I sometimes sense that when people talk about short stories the assumption is that the short story is somehow less accomplished than the novel. And I don’t think so at all. Sometimes people talk about starting out with the short story and then moving on to a novel, and I just think I find both forms to be equally difficult. It’s very difficult for me to know why I am drawn to the short story for a particular subject. I think the particular subject wants to be a short story. It’s very hard to know why you do what you do. - Lit Hub
