Jayasuriya confident team will turn the corner soon

Chief selector Sanath Jayasuriya was confident that the young and inexperienced Sri Lanka team will turn the corner very soon.
“As a former captain and as the chairman of selectors I am disappointed that we lost the one-day series to Zimbabwe,” said Jayasuriya.
“We need to give them the strength and the confidence to come out of this situation. We need to fine tune some of the areas batsmen and bowlers. When you get a 100 you need try and get to 150 these are little things we need to fine tune. “These are young players and they will learn and correct themselves. They should take on the responsibility. After the last ODI defeat they are under a lot of pressure.
"We need to give them the confidence and have a very close relationship with this young side. Asanka (Gurusinha) and the supporting staff will need to do it and they will come out of this situation,” he said.
Jayasuriya pointed out that if Sri Lanka had lost to a side like Australia none of the questions would have been asked because Australia was a far better team.
“We beat Australia 3-0, we are a capable team there’s no doubt the talent is there. Give them a little bit of time. As senior cricketers we also went through such times and when the media is after you it’s very difficult but when you have the experience you can soak the pressure.” Jayasuriya said. - ST
