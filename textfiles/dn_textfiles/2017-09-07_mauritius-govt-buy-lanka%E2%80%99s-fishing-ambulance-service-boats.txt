Mauritius govt to buy Lanka’s fishing, ambulance service boats

Mauritian Ocean Affairs Minister Premdut Koonjoo has agreed to purchase fisheries and ambulance vessels for Mauritius from Sri Lanka. He said the agreement will be signed between Sri Lanka and Mauritius shortly.
This was discussed during a meeting between him and Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera at his residence, on Saturday.
Minister Amaraweera apprised him of the fishing boats produced by the state funded Cey-Nor Foundation. He explained that the company is currently producing a fleet of over 55-feet boats with modern facilities and technology. The minister stated that the boats are being produced within a month and Seychelles and several countries have requested for boats.
Mahinda Amaraweera said Sri Lanka is a middle income country and that the Sri Lankan Government is giving priority to the welfare of the people.
Accordingly, the government has provided financial support for the construction of a fully-fledged house for the fisher community. All steps will be taken to support fishermen for the completion of their houses.
The government has allocated Rs. 1,200 million from the budget in this regard, the Minister said.
