Former French PM confident European Parliament will vote in favour of Sri Lanka

The President of the Constitutional Council of France and former Prime Minister Laurent Fabius yesterday stated that he believed that the European Parliament would vote in favour of granting Sri Lanka GSP Plus when it convenes in May of this year.
The European Commission, the executive body of the European Union (EU) in January proposed to restore the special concessions under the Generalized Scheme of Preferences Plus (GSP Plus) for imports from Sri Lanka in exchange of an improved human rights and labour record. The recommendation however has to be ratified by the European Parliament to take effect.
Fabius who delivered a lecture on “Europe and the International Order, Post-Brexit” at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute of International Relations and Strategic Studies observed that Europe would remain a major trading partner and leading financial source for infrastructure to Sri Lanka despite Britain choosing to leave its fold. “France is a strong supporter of Sri Lanka receiving GSP Plus,”Fabius said.
Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera who also addressed the event said that 40 percent of all exports to the EU was to the UK and thus Brexit would greatly affect the country’s trade, “With Brexit, Sri Lanka will lose the advantage of the GSP plus in the UK and the possible depreciation of the pound during and after Brexit will also add to the impact and affect inbound tourism as well as exports”, said Samaraweera.
Fabius pointed out that though Brexit would be triggered later this year,it would take at least two years for the process to finalize leading to a period of great economic uncertainty especially in the UK.
He however added that given that the EU market was still larger than a standalone British one, countries trading with the EU would still be at an advantage.
The granting of GSP plus was stopped to Sri Lanka in 2010 due to the failure to address the reported human rights violations in the country.
Fabius also said that France was ready to help Sri Lanka rise from its trauma from decades of civil war ‘at its own pace’.
An important observation as Sri Lanka looks to answer for its slow progress in tackling alleged war crimes and human rights violations at the upcoming UN Human Rights Council Sessions in Geneva on February 27.
