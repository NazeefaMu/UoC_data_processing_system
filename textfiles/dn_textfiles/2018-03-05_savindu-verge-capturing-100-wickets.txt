Savindu on the verge of capturing 100 wickets

A fourth year coloursman and an allrounder and first eleven cricket captain of Prince of Wales College Savindu Peiris has so far captured 98 wickets and in addition to Cambrian Sebastanite Big Match he has another inter-school match in hand.
Savindu bats left hand and bowls right arm off spin and he has passed the 400 mark in sixteen matches.
He has taken two ten wicket hauls and six five wicket hauls and his best is against D S Senanayake Vidyalaya with 13 for 75 (6/17 and 7/58) and also he claimed 10 for 62 (5/38 and 5/24) versus Isipathana Vidyalaya.
Savindu will add another feather to his cap in addition to his performances when he leads the Cambrians with their arch rivals Sebastanites in the 68th Big Match as his father Nishantha Peiris was the Vice Captain in 1985 team and his elder brother Nuwantha Peiris captained in 2010 which is a record for the Cambrian-Sebastanite Big Match Series since 1933.
