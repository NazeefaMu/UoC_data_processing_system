Sydney Opera House: Iconic colosseum of imagination and creativity

My first view on Sydney Opera House made me profusely proud of human imagination and creativity not in uncertain terms. It also prides a thespian nation who naturally boasts of many a connoisseur as proved to me on my month-long sojourn in the land of kangaroos. In my silent reflections, my whole stay on this land of myriad perspectives was a fruitful experience that humbled a lion by a kangaroo.
It is said ‘’The sun did not know how beautiful its light was until it reflected off this building.’’
By any yardstick, Sydney Opera House doesn’t seem to play second fiddle to any such manmade coliseum. This preamble would prompt you to go deeper not only into the process of erection of this great monumental edifice but also the architectural genius behind this world heritage masterpiece. The great name was cemented in the history of mankind in 2007 and ever since the unending crowds of thespian pilgrims have been thronging this hallowed site with great reverence to human imagination.
Groundbreaking design
The glittering atmosphere of Sydney was enhanced with immense beauty to a new height with the addition of Sydney Opera House through the groundbreaking design masterminded by the Danish Architect John Utzon. It is another story to be unfolded because of its dramatic significance. The whole drama starts with the unprecedented flow of entries sent for this great human endeavour of a bullion standard. It was an international competition among the members of a target group of high calibre and there had been 232 entries altogether.
The creation of a performing arts centre of this stature is quite a formidable feat of architectural and engineering acumen. The Danish architect John Utzon merged the winner and human history of connoisseurs were sealed and it was in the hand of another fellow human being on planet earth for which Australia could claim credit. This gigantic project has taken fourteen long years for its completion with the labour of 10,000 workers.
The calculated number of roof tiles had been 1,056,006. The budgetary allocations have been naturally wide, but the Australian government has not taken any foot backwards in this great task for which the human population on planet earth owes a huge debt to them for giving a delicious treat to the eyes. Yet, another gloomy fact connected with the episode is that the architectural mastermind of the project Utzon has ironically resigned himself before the culmination of the erection. But, the kangaroo dream was finally realized in 1973.
Mechanical action
Opera House consists of a multifaceted collection of performing arts centres. The Concert Hall ranks prominently among them. Its significance is paramount because of the very fact that it houses the world’s largest mechanical action organ. Its remarkability further enhances in the fact that there is only one craftsman in the world who is able to tune it. It boasts of 10,154 pipes.
The completion of this structure has taken a long period of ten years. It could provide seating facilities to 2,679 people. The high vaulted ceiling and the wooden panelling combine to give the maximum possible support for the best performances by the world-renowned artist of Michael Jackson’s calibre. It is also the home for resident performing companies such as Sydney Symphony Orchestra and The Australian Chamber Orchestra.
The Forecourt is another addition to this great structure and in 1996 a recorded crowd of more than 100,000 people have gathered there for a house concert of global fame. It is of universal acclaim as the queen of the most picturesque outdoor performing spaces the world has ever seen. Nelson Mandela after having completed his long walk to freedom has addressed a mammoth gathering here in 1990 immediately after his release. The Joan Sutherland Theatre is a glowing tribute to La Stupenda, the legendary Australian soprano of ‘voice of the century ‘fame. Initially, the venue was known as Opera Theatre but it was renamed as above in 2012. It ranks the second largest venue in the array and 76 musicians and 1507 viewers could be comfortably accommodated in it.The year-round musical performances taking place here speak volumes for its significance and popularity among the theatregoers. The specific form of the theatre plays the role of a catalyst in giving a superb experience of fine musicality.
Everything theoretical
The Drama Theatre goes parallel to the other sources of entertainment in SYDNEY OPERA HOUSE that houses almost everything theoretical under the sun. With 544 seating facilities, the drama theatre caters to the aesthetic desires of the robust theatre lovers. It has become a holy site for the theatre lovers with the treading of the iconic artists such as Sir Ian McKellen, Toni Colette, Sylvie Guillem, Mel Gibson and Hugo Weaving. The Playhouse is mainly associated with art and Australian beach culture. The 1970s was a remarkable decade for surf movies because of the screening of very many movies related to the glowing sphere in the playhouse.
It was the main venue for them. The target is often the younger generation. Storytelling, dance and theoretical experiments are the core aspects of generating creativity and interest among the posterity. The national objectives are long ranged. The place is now used for relaxation. The Studio is a major attraction as it is a fine combination of sound, light and seating systems. The world’s most daring performances find The Studio as an ideal venue. Originally, it had been a library. Its flexibility enables the theatre lovers to use it for diverse productions. While the morning session is devoted to children from age two, the evening is for an aesthetically mature adult generation. Cabaret and circus act performed here to cater to the delight of the art lovers. It has been designed to seat 300 people and the beautiful experiences the visitors gain to keep them glued to the place.
Great edifice
Utzon Room has a story of itself to unfold. The greatness of the architect is inscribed in the following words. Jorn Utzon, the chief architect of the great edifice, was asked whether he would be happy to have this room named after him. He has said that it could be the greatest honour he could ever receive.
The present Utzon Room is the only completed inner design under his belt according to the accessible evidence. The vibrant design of the tapestry of the western wall is a single honour for him. 200 people could be seated in it and the Sydney harbour and the Botanic garden could be viewed to please the eye. The chamber music performances here reverberate the wellspring of genuine creativity of the colossus architect. The cultural vibrancy of a nation is best epitomized by the Sydney Opera House. Could I humbly claim that this edifice belongs to the whole mankind yet with great respect to Australians to whom we have a huge debt for giving our eyes a great feast?
