President lights up Vesak at Nawaloka Hospital

Lanterns illuminated the evening sky, earthen lamps dotted the road and pathways and lights decked up the entire building of Nawaloka Hospital when President Maithripala Sirisena inaugurated Vesak celebrations at the premises of Sri Lanka’s leader in private healthcare.
The tradition of the annual celebration was hosted by Nawaloka Hospitals and Nawaloka Holdings, with Chairman Jayantha Dharmadasa and senior management, on hand to greet all guests.
A star studded galaxy of cinema and television personalities mingled with other invitees, as they gathered to show their collective application for the intricate lanterns and other creative handwork crafted by employees.
Highlight of the evening was the Nawaloka Vesak Dansala, which President Sirisena officially inaugurated, gave out 20,000 parcels of dinner and 10,000 ice creams for two consecutive days.
The celebrity film stars were the judges of the Vesak lantern competition, painstakingly and lovingly crafted by employees of both Nawaloka Hospitals and Holdings. On display were Vesak art, spiritual poetry and greeting cards turned out by employees.
The digitally illuminated Pandol, Vesak Drama and Bakthi Gee were all a part of the celebrity festivities that went on until dawn and enjoyed by the many Vesak sight-seers who had travelled from all parts of Sri Lanka.
“It was an honour to have President Maithripala Sirisena as our special guest of honour to inaugurate the Vesak celebrations and traditions,” exclaimed Nawaloka Holdings and Nawaloka Hospitals Chairman Jayantha Dharmadasa. Dharmadasa whilst thanking all those who participated in the festivities said, “It’s such a glorious opportunity for us to make our own contribution towards society along the cherished path.”
