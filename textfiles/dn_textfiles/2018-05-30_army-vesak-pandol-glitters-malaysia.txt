Army Vesak pandol glitters in Malaysia

The Army-put up Vesak pandol in Malaysia glitters making history rejuvenating the legacy of spiritual connectivity and cultural ethos that has been existing between Sri Lanka and Malaysia for generations.
The brightly-lit up pandol, erected by the Sri Lanka Army’s Corps of Engineer Services (CES), following an initiative of Sri Lanka’s High Commission in Malaysia, was ceremonially opened for display on Saturday (26) evening at the Brickfields Buddhist temple, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The pandol was put up on the directions of Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake, following a request made by the Buddhist prelate, Brickfields Buddhist Temple and High Commissioner for Sri Lanka in Malaysia A. J. M. Muzammil.
