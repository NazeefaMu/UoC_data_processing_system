Third Space Global employs online tutors

Third Space Global builds the world’s first global teaching network of highly trained online tutors supported by cutting edge technology. Third Space Learning offers the largest network of one-on-one Math tuition in the UK. In the last four years, the company has worked with 16,000 children across 600 schools by recruiting young and intelligent Sri Lankans. The tutors undergo an intensive training programme on the newest teaching techniques and how to use Third Space technology to deliver results for children we work with.
Third Space Global, a UK owned BOI approved company, opened its new regional headquarters at Orion City, Colombo 9 recently. The company has grown to over 200 staff since it began operations in September 2015.
CEO, Third Space Global, British-born Sri Lankan Roshan Nilaweera plans to create 1000s of jobs for young Sri Lankans to engage in the global digital economy.
“Whilst Third Space is a purely export company, it is also keen to support education in Sri Lanka through its innovative CSR programmes. For the past six weeks Third Space has been running a free eLearing Hub programme from their office and has welcomed 800 visits by 8-16 year olds. Unlike a school or a tuition centre, young learners receive a quick orientation and then set about managing their own learning schedules as they work with free online eLearning programmes.
TSG staff is on hand to provide a helping hand but always ensure that learners develop autonomy and independent thinking and problem solving skills,” Nilaweera said.
Nilaweera who was a Math and ICT teacher who studied a MEng in Computer Science in the UK points out that creating employment and training opportunities for young Sri Lankans through this initiative will contribute to Sri Lanka’s economic development.
Third Space Global plans to provide a free toolkit so this eLearning Programme model can be replicated by other companies opening their offices to learners nationwide.
The company also plans to launch free teaching and learning workshops next summer to support teacher training across the nation. They are already in discussion with potential partners but welcome others interested in partnering with them on this venture. Nilaweera was joined by, the Founder and CEO of Third Space Learning the London based parent company, Tom Hooper for the opening.
