Home Lands Skyline launches two more projects

Celebrating their success at Asia Property Awards ceremony in their annual gathering, Home Lands Skyline launched Ariyana Resort Apartments Residencies - Athurugiriya and Sparkles Skyline Residencies- Malabe ,with a total of 423 new units under their wings.
Today, the necessity of affordable, modern housing around Sri Lanka has become a radically increasing requirement in the country especially in and around Colombo and its suburbs. However, due to the scarcity of available lands and increasing land price in Colombo, it is highly unlikely that an individual could find and afford a land and build a house on their own.
Hence These housing projects is becoming a better option for those who seek a living space as the cost of buying land in a good residential area and building a house seems higher.
Being one of the developers who has recognized this requirement in the society, Home Lands Skyline, with the launch of these two massive projects aims to provide housing units for upper and middle income earning families and once completed will represent a housing solution that will be inexpensive while not compromising on aesthetics and function.
