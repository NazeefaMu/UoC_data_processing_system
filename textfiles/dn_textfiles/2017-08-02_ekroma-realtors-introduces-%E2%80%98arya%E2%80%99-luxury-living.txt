Ekroma Realtors introduces ‘Arya’ for luxury living

Ekroma Realtors are a BOI approved Real estate and development company with the vision to give Colombo a unique and new way of living that suits the needs of the modern dweller.
With the aim of innovatively bringing luxury and modern living to the heart of Colombo, the company is the pioneer of the concept of boutique living in Sri Lanka with their first project, Elegant 16 which will be completed by March of 2018.
Ekroma Realtors now looks to expand this stylish concept of living with the introduction of their latest project ‘Arya.’
Arya is going for a pre-sale price of Rs.38 million upwards with a reservation amount of Rs.2 million. This 28-unit apartment complex is to be located at Kynsey Road, Colombo 8. This prime location is ideal for those who want to live within the convenient epicentre of the city.
Arya is set to be spread across more than ten floors, with the ground floor and adequate parking floors, six floors of 2 and 3-bedroom units and 4 penthouse suites. The ground breaking for Arya will take place by November of 2017.
Ekroma Realtors’ key strength is the attention they pay to delivering the concept of urban living while ensuring that the residents have a place they can call home and this is exactly what they hope to deliver with Arya. Spearheaded by well renowned architect Athula Amarasekera.
