Gender quotas and equal opportunities

Increasing female representation in the political arena whilst ensuring gender equality in elections are issues that needs to be addressed with all possible haste in Sri Lanka. While the majority would state that over the past couple of years female participation in politics has gradually increased, in reality it has hardly made a dent on actual numbers.
It is in this backdrop that many countries decided to introduce a quota system to help women enter politics. According to the United Nations, quotas have exceptionally risen in the past decade around the world with about 40 countries implementing gender quotas in their Constitutions. Political parties in 50 other countries have also voluntarily implemented quotas in their voting lists. This means that around half of the world’s countries today use one or another form of quotas in politics.
Does quota system work for gender equality in politics?
Despite the wide adoption of quotas, the quota system itself has been subjected to many an interesting debate on how effective it really is. The political world also argues that gender quotas will not help women and those quotas only make women appear ‘weak’ in the world of politics.
Gender equality does not mean that women and men are the same in biological terms, according to United Nations Women (UN Women -2011). Instead, it is that women and men should be treated the same regarding their rights, responsibilities and opportunities.
Women’s participation in the workforce has increased from 35 percent in 1990 to 40 percent in 2015 and the seats held by women in National Parliament have increased steadily between the year 2000 and 2015, but women are still under-represented in the world Parliaments with an average of one female out of five members, state the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP, 2015).
Given these dismal figures, the issue of gender equality in elections became a central point of focus at the recently held 14th International Electoral Affairs Symposium, organised by the International Centre for Parliamentary studies in association with the Election Commission of Sri Lanka.
The current challenges and opportunities on how to ensure accessibility, proportionally and representatives in elections whilst ensuring gender equality, were widely discussed among the representatives from different countries.
Experiences abroad
CEO, Central Election Commission of Palestine Hisham Kuhail was of the opinion that there was no need to rely on government rules and regulations to ensure gender equality.
He said an electoral body can contribute in many ways towards gender equality and the quota system was just one such tool. Public awareness needs to be promoted by bringing the stake holders on board to engage with the public and empower women to engage in the political process, said Kuhail.
“Recently, we concluded a project funded by Norway, in which we had to bring the relevant stakeholders, civil society organisations and women organisations to address the needs highlighted by the Palestinian community. It was pointed out that women have less self- esteem to engage in political life. Therefore, we formulated strategies for women empowerment. We have also trained 500 people on advocacy using all the stakeholders and media. That was about empowering or enabling females in the local councils to come up with their ideas and guide them in implementing their ideas. An electoral body can embark on a pro-active approach to reach a specific goal,” he said.
Moderator of the panel, Naushalya Rajapaksa, Attorney at law, Official Youth Delegate of Sri Lanka to the 70th United Nations General Assembly, pointed out that Bangladesh has top-ranked in gender equity in South Asia for the second consecutive year having closed its overall gender gap, according to the Global Gender Gap Index 2016 prepared by World Economic Forum.
She said Bangladesh has become the region’s top performer, recording progress on the political empowerment gender gap.
Chief Election Commissioner, Bangladesh Election Commission, K.M Nurul Huda pointed out that this was due to the fact that the Constitution of Bangladesh had clearly stated the obligations of the people, politicians and the social responsibility towards engaging more women on the political empowerment process.
He referred to two great women in Bangladesh’s political history, former Prime Minister Khaledha Zia and incumbent Prime Minister Sheik Hasina, as examples of such positive reinforcement.
“If you take our history since 1996, women have represented key positions in Parliament such as the Prime Minister or Leader of the Opposition,” he said.
Huda further explained that in local government elections, it was compulsory by law that one part of the permanent members, directly appointed by the area should be women. This contributed immensely in the decision making process of the local government bodies. It was also mandatory for a political party to have 30 percent of women representation.
“The percentage of women engaging in different fields has increased and they equally represent men in all positions. I think we are going ahead in the right direction,” he added.
Responding to a question raised by an audience about women leaders in the political field not hailing from political families, Huda said in South Asia, the majority of women engaged in politics come from a political background.
“But there are also women who come into politics without a political background. The system that has been developed so far in Bangladesh encourages women without a family background also to engage in the political process. People also sometimes choose their leaders considering their family background,” he said.
Rajapaksa in the meantime, questioned Kuhail on Article (17) of the Palestinian law on Local Council elections which guaranteed that women hold 20 percent of seats. She asked who decided whether women should hold 10 or 20 seats in the local bodies and asserted that once again, it was the men who made such decisions.
Kuhail responded that it differed from each country and in Palestine it was 20 percent. He stressed not to rely on the implementation of law and to be proactive.
“Don’t always wait for the government to change to bring about a change within the community. Start nagging the political parties. It is also the commitment of the political parties to advance women in the political process. Sometimes women are used to complete a quota. When there is a precise quota, the parties always try to stick to the quota and do not go above that. That needs to be changed,” he said.
Electoral Commissioner, Electoral Commissioner’s office Mauritius, Irfan Abdool Rahman added that the year 2012 was an important year for women in Mauritius.
“It was the year when the local government implemented a law which stated that at least one third of the candidates that run for local elections need to be of a different gender. This contributed to a notable increase in the number of women nominated and elected in Local Government and thus contested the notion that politics only belonged to men,” he said.
Rahman further said one step towards gender equality in politics was to modernise the electoral system to create conditions to help more women participate actively in public life and reinforce the existing tendency to produce diverse and broad representation of all.
“The quota system is the first step to ensure women’s active political involvement.
However, as is seen from the results of the elections, the direct effect from the legislation has increased women’s representation in the Local Government from 5 percent to 25 percent in Village Councils and from 12 percent to 35 percent in Municipal Councils,” he said.
Challenges for women in politics
Female participation in politics is considered an issue wrought with personal, social and economic concerns. It is a huge challenge, for men and women without a political background to enter politics and women have other obstacles added to their path to make it even more arduous.
If this problem is to be addressed in an efficient and sustainable manner, Chief of Party, International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES) Sri Lanka, Beverley Hagerdon explained that not one organization can be expected to solve all the prevailing issues relevant to women and politics.
“It is considered a challenge for women to engage in the political process as there is a wrong public perception about women leaders. They are perceived to be weak, not having enough financial stability, having child care responsibilities, there is wide spread character assassination against women candidates in media as well as social media and violence against women who want to enter politics,” she said.
She explained that it was more effective to use targeted and evidence based approaches to integrate men and women in the process and to promote diverse and inclusive representation to make desirable progress in the field.
“In Sri Lanka, there were 6,000 positions in the Local Government level. Women were allocated 2,000 seats which is a 25 percent quota. The space wasn’t created for women within that 6,000 positions, rather an extra 2,000 seats were added. Now there is going to be 8,000 seats for the Local Government level,” she said.
Hagerdon noted that the socio cultural issues that women have to deal are also a barrier and added that electoral leadership and finding ways to get into politics was still a great challenge for women.
It is very evident in Sri Lanka that the lack of political awareness and empowerment among women is a prominent factor behind such low representation. Creating an environment for these women to succeed will result in the society being more receptive towards female leadership, she said.
