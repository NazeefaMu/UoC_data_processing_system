JVP, GMOA to unite to fight SAITM

 
The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) and the JVP held a discussion this morning (6) on the SAITM issue and agreed to fight together on a common platform to defeat SAITM.
SAITM puts the medical service and patients' lives in a great danger, JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said.
He told the media that legal issues relating to the judgment by the Court of appeal on SAITM was discussed at the meeting as well as possible steps to be taken together in future to tackle the issue.
GMOA Media Spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda confirmed the GMOA had met with JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, Bimal Ratnayake and others.
“We especially discussed the strong disapproval for SAITM by three independent academic expert committees, which is the committee appointed by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), the committee appointed by the Health Ministry and the committee of the state Medical Faculty Deans.
These are the committees any country in the world appoints to make recommendations on health and medical education,” he said.
Dr. Ananada said the GMOA and the JVP would fight on a common platform against SAITM. “We agreed that the responsibility of safeguarding patients' rights belong to all of us.
Therefore we will do certain things in future together to maintain the minimum standard of medical education in Sri Lanka,” he said.
“We agreed that it is the SLMC which is the supreme body when it comes to regulating the standard of medical education and patients' safety in Sri Lanka similar to any other country in the world.
The GMOA will meet some parliamentarians today and tomorrow.
Requests have already been made to meet the President and the Prime Minister,” he added.
Meanwhile Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) Chairman Prof. Carlo Fonseka said that the Council would call an emergency session on Wednesday where they are expected to take certain crucial decisions.
