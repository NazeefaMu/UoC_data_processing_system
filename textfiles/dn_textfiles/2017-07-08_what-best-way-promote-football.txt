What is the best way to promote football?

Kandy Sports Round-Up:
The newly elected FFSL committee must undertake an initiative to make football ‘a sport of choice’. In the famous city of Kandy, where rugby rules the popularity charts, the Kandy’s football lovers are making an attempt to make football the No 1 sport. Incidentally, the move comes after the popularity gained by the supporters. Sad to say for the first time Kandy FL was not entitled to attend the FFSL AGM, because they had not held their AGM.
However the Kandy FL president was made a vice president of the FFSL at the AGM. Thus the man who failed to conduct tournaments in the proper way for the last couple of years and also failed to hold this year’s AGM was elected as one of the Vice Presidents of FFSL. That is the sporting friendship that exists at present in football. Today the Kandy FL is run by coaches they only want their coaching seminars and coaching classes, no tournaments. At the moment Kandy’s football is in a mess and run by coaches who have misbehaved and were punished by the law. Kandy’s football lovers expect a lot from the new committee.
Iswan back as head
Iswan Omar former Trinity, Kandy RFC, Kandy SC, Dimbulla ACC, Uva, Dickoya MCC, Up-Country and Sri Lanka Presidents XV forward continues as the president of the CPRFU after being elected once again at the AGM.

The committee is formed by members from the following, Kandy SC, Dimbulla ACC, Dickoya MCC, Peradeniya University, Kandy Youth SC, OTSC, Old Antonians SC, Old Kingswoodians SC, Matale RFC and OTSC but only the first named club plays the game, while the others have forgotten it. The Office bearers: Patron Dharmasiri Madugalla, Trustee Malik Samarawickrema, President Iswan Omar, Past President’s Mohan Samarakoon, Trevor Nugawela , Vice President Tuan Dole, Secretary Gerald Rasiah, Treasurer C.P.P.

They had their first committee meeting last evening at the club house and the day before the meeting a selected crowd met for a dinner, to decide the date of the SGM. The president of the club was a worried man over the accounts matter appearing in the media.
Kandy Rugby Academy to help CPRFU
The Kandy Rugby Academy under the chairmanship of former Zahirian A.W.A. Rasheed is going all-out to give a helping hand to the young ruggeirtes. Today this rugby academy can be rated as one of the best in the country, which gives a big hand for the young ruggerites.
There are however moves to undermine the work done by this academy with moves to start another rival academy. This is sports promotion in Kandy today.
