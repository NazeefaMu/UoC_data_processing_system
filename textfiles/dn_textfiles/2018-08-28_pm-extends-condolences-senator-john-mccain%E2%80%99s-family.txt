PM extends condolences to Senator John McCain’s family

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday offered his deepest condolences to the family of the late US Senator John McCain, who passed away on Saturday, at the age of 81.
In a Twitter message, the Prime Minister said, “Maithree and I are saddened by the passing of Senator McCain. John was a friend and colleague since we first met in the 1990s, during his visit to Sri Lanka. In 2014, we met at his Sedona Forum Conference in Arizona, the place he spent his last year.”
“John was a great champion of American values with a deep conviction of individual liberties and democracies. This cemented our friendship.”
“John was a true and reliable friend of Sri Lanka through the years in between, supporting democracy and development through support for Sri Lanka through challenging times for the bilateral partnership. We in Sri Lanka, and the US and the world will miss this global leader.”
“Our heartfelt condolences to Cindy and the family.”
