Maybank Indonesia adopts BoardPAC's Paperless Board Solution

A leading bank in Indonesia has deployed the Sri Lanka developed ‘BoardPAC’ board-meeting automation solution to become the first bank in that country to be equipped for paperless board meetings.
Part of Malayan Banking Berhad Group -- one of the largest financial services groups in the ASEAN region -- Maybank Indonesia is the latest international customer to adopt the BoardPAC board automation solution for its board members. BoardPAC has also been adopted by board members of the bank's parent group, Maybank Malaysia.
BoardPAC is an effective way for board directors to access board and committee papers and supplementary information directly on their iPads. The solution enables efficient and secure access to company documents and is collaboration enabled for quick decision making through an interactive approach. BoardPAC has a wide range of high profile international corporate customers, including several Fortune 500 companies.
Commenting on the Bank's decision to go paperless as facilitated by BoardPAC, MrBudiSantoso, Head of Corporate Secretary of Maybank Indonesia said that BoardPAC stood out from the competition in the market due to its distinct advantages.
“BoardPAC's easy-to-use platform enables administrators to quickly prepare for meetings, permitting us to collate and send across information that is timely and relevant to our board members. Administrators are now able to concentrate on ensuring the efficiencies, rather than getting bogged down with handling paper-based communications and the large volume of printing, photocopying, binding and couriering involved in getting information into the hands of board members,” he said.
LakminiWijesundera, CEO of BoardPAC added: “We are pleased to welcome Maybank Indonesia to our high profile international customer base for BoardPAC. More and more companies globally are coming to depend on BoardPAC to facilitate paperless decision-making that not only enhances efficiency but also ensures greater security of information. Board Members of our partnering companies find that their decision-making skills are significantly improved and
become more effective as a result of BoardPAC's ability to offer timely information at their fingertips. We are confident that Maybank Indonesia will experience infinite value with this paperless Board solution.”
BoardPAC already has the largest market share for board meeting automation in Sri Lanka, Malaysia and in the Asia Pacific region, and is emerging as a leader across the globe. Its operations have expanded overseas with offices in the US, Malaysia and Singapore coupled with partner offices in 20 countries.
