All Sri Lankans will be issued E-NICs : Nawinna

All Sri Lankan citizens will be issued with e- NIC s within the next two months, said Kurunegala District UNP Parliamentarian and Minister of Wayamba Development and Internal Affairs and Culture
S.B. Nawinna, addressing a meeting of provincial media personnel of the NWP held recently in Kurunegala.
The minister added that he still uses the NIC issued in 1972. That means about 45 years have elapsed but nobody took the trouble to issue an updated NIC so far. "Further, within the next few months, e- passports too would be issued from my ministry, he said. Issuing of passports under the one day service too would commence in Kurunegla to facilitate the residents of both Kurunegala and Puttalam Districts of the NWP," Minister S.B. Nawinna further said.
All Divisional Secretaries and Two District Secretaries of the NWP participated.
Meanwhile, the Department of Registration of Persons has launched a programme to issue NIC s under the one day service every working day from 7.30 a.m. to 1.30 p.m. and Commissioner General of the Department, Wiyani Gunathilake told Daily News in Kurunegala that daily about 1,000 new NICs are issued now under the one day service and applicants have to pay Rs.1,000 per NIC under this special service. All applicants are requested by the department to forward accurate information to save time.
