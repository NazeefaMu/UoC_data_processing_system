New York celebrates Deepavali

The Permanent Mission of Sri Lanka to the United Nations in New York celebrated Deepavali on Friday, November 9, at the Mission premises.
Many Sri Lankans and Permanent Missions' representatives from India, Singapore and Malaysia attended the event. It commenced with the lighting of the traditional oil lamp.
Religious Affairs Director of the Hindu Temple Society of North America, Swamy Ravi Vaidyanaat, outlined the significance of Deepavali, and conducted a Hindu religious observance.
Deepavali coincides with the new moon in the Hindu lunisolar calendar which is also known as the amasvasya. The five day celebrations begin two days before the amasvasya, and extends for two days. Thus, the festival serves as a moment to rejuvenate the spirit for the year ahead, he explained.
He noted the significance of Deepavali in worshipping the Hindu Goddess Lakshmi and recited Hindu Shlokas about the Goddess and peace, in Sanskrit with English translation.
The festival is celebrated as an important national holiday in Sri Lanka. During this auspicious festival, light serves as a symbol of knowledge, enlightenment, and the dispelling of spiritual darkness. The festival transcends all boundaries of religion, faith, or culture, said Ambassador Dr. Rohan Perera, in his address.
The event concluded with a vegetarian dinner, featuring traditional delicacies.
