Citizen's Mail

CMC’s priorities gone topsy-turvy!
Yesterday, when I visited my daughter who is residing at Armour Street Flats, I noticed that the CMC has fixed a completely new assessment number. The new number 40/228 printed in black on a goldish colour metal plate cut to an elliptical shape has been affixed to the wall. This has been fixed when the present number B1 F26 is already there. Now, all the houses have two Assessment Numbers on the wall which is not only odd but also can create confusion.
The Municipality, when it should focus more on the disposal of garbage as for the slightest shower of rain, the drains overflow and the roads get inundated in and around these flats. I have noticed a lot of garbage in the drains which the Municipality do not care about.
My daughter wanted to know whether we are to insert the new number when taking ID cards for the first time, when taking new IDs, birth-certificate for the newborn child, etc? What is the number we are supposed to use in the future?
The utility bills will carry the former address and any mail received will have only the former address. Are we to inform the service providers about a change in the number? Are we supposed to keep both the addresses on our wall?
I think the CMC has wasted invaluable funds by printing these numbers, for the condominium buildings in particular, which could have been put to better use. Over to the Mayoress to spend the CMC funds prudentially.
