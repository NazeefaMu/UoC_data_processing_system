Hambantota fiasco should be avoided in Galle

We have seen enough in Hambantota.We also know the reasons for it.Successive governments and SLPA management did not take the advantages of allowing local and foreign investors to partake in the development in Hambantota.
It was the short sighted policies which led to the skirmish and mayhem.Finally the Navy Commander was at the receiving end.
Development of Galle is long outstanding .If you have time to go into the port ,you will note how empty it is.Partly developed Marina is hardly full with no other infrastructure.
A Yacht Repair and Leisure Craft repair and building project was mooted but got stranded due to withdrawal of the investor. Local company took over and offered to continue,but SLPA was not very supportive.
The Government and SLPA is contemplating to entrust the whole harbour to a foreign investor to convert the same into a fully fledged marina.SLPA and the State wants to move out the Navy Camp elsewhere.

Now that Hambantota has got a permanent Navy contingent ,Southern Command of the Navy based in Galle can be moved out.I am not sure what they intend to do with the Fishery Harbour.
The day they try to relocate the Fishery Harbour there will be blood shed.
Nobody will invest in a Marina with a dirty disorganised fishery harbour breathing at their neck. An Indian Company looks like eying for the Marina Project in Galle Harbour with around 50 US$million.
The SLPA is giving notice to the local investors willing to re-float the Yacht Repair Project.SLPA is of the opinion that the whole harbour in toto should be given.Another investor is offering to put up a mixed development project bordering the harbour.The Tourist Board is imposing height restrictions for the building.The Urban Development Authority is dilly dallying in granting the development permit. A Cabinet Committee of Economic Management (CCEM) is going along with SLPA and allowing the Agency for Strategic Development select nominated investor using Swiss Challenge Method.
Many do not know what the Swiss Challenge is ?.
If at all a new investor comes in he will ask for a 99 year lease and they have to get rid of not only the Navy but also the cement bagging and unloading operations of Holcim Cement.Supply boats currently using Galle harbour may have to follow the rules to be imposed by the new investor.
The SLPA staff will lose their jobs and they will follow suit of their Hambantota bretheren.This scenario must be avoided.
