Chinese star trio fined for rare revolt

Shanghai: Table tennis authorities hit world number one Ma Long and two other Chinese stars with $20,000 fines Tuesday but stopped short of suspending them after they quit a tournament in protest at their coach's removal. The International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) said that Ma, Fan Zhendong and Xu Xin -- the three top-ranked players in the world -- "damaged the reputation of the ITTF" and "let down the global fans at the China Open".
But the ITTF said in a statement that it had resisted a one-month ban after the trio promised there would be no repeat in future and explained why they had failed to turn up for their round-of-16 matches in Chengdu, southwestern China, in June.
"The trio did not provide the ITTF or the organising committee any immediate reason why they did not turn up for their matches," the ITTF said.
"However, due to the players' explanations, both their own and CTTA's assurances that such behaviour will not be repeated, the three players will not receive any suspension and will be fined $20,000 each." AFP
