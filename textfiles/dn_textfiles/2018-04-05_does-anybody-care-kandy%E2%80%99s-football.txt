Does anybody care for Kandy’s football?

When will Kandy’s football get back to where it was? This is the question on every football fan's lips. There are plans, by some of the keen football lovers to help kick back football to its former glory days when Kandy produced top class players who went on to sport national colours. If that is to happen then it is essential that a new set of competent promoters should serve in the committee. Today football in Kandy is in the doldrums, from 1988 to 2010 the sport flourished, but sad to say, the sport is now at a low ebb.
Football is a game popular all over the world but it is sad that it is not so in Kandy which has rich history in the Hill Capital when men who mattered ran the game when even Colombo feared them. But sadly the game has received step motherly treatment in the last six years or so, and is out of the big picture. The Kandy Association Football League (KAFL) is 93 years old.
Football in Kandy can be traced back and has a record of over being over 150 years, when white servicemen were there they took a keen interest. Kand AFL was formed in 1925. It is one of the founder members of the Football Federation of Sri Lanka (FFSL) (earlier known as Ceylon Football Association). Kandy had one of biggest leagues with over 40 teams.
At present, the people who are involved administrating Kandy football don’t know its history. Only now a knockout tournament is played in Kandy. Last year the AGM and the tournaments was not held and the FFSL has not taken any action.
Kandy won the All Island Senior and junior League championship for the first time under the presidency of B.M. Liyanage. With this win Kandy toured Nepal. It was the first ever Kandy team to go on an overseas tour, that was in early 1990’s. What the controlling body should do is to appoint an interim committee and run football in Kandy until it is properly organized. They should obtain the support of those who have done great service to this game in the past. Last year’s AGM was not held, and a person who is involved with football. a club owner who is into gambling tried to come in as president to promote his gambling.
Holding office for prestige is not what is required now. People must come forward and serve football. Today, most officials holding office are only keen on coaching and refereeing for financial benefits. If football in Kandy is to improve the controlling body must put the leagues on the correct path.
The FFSL is not showing any interest for Kandy football. It is time they woke from their deep slumber and started to move the game of football in Kandy towards the right direction.
