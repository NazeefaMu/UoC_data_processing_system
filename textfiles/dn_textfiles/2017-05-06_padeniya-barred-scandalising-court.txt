Padeniya barred from scandalising court

Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) President Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya was yesterday noticed to appear before the Court of Appeal on May 22 for allegedly undermining the Court of Appeal judgment dated January 31, 2017 which was delivered compelling the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) to register the MBBS graduates of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine Limited (SAITM) provisionally as medical practitioners in terms of the Medical Ordinance.
Meanwhile, the two-Judge-Bench comprising Court of Appeal (President) Justice Vijith Malalgoda and Justice S. Thurai Rajah issued an Interim Order(IO) preventing GMOA President from making or publishing further contemptuous statements/articles scandalising the Court of Appeal until the next date.
Two civil society activists Prof.Sarath Wijesuriya, the Convener of National Movement for Social Justice (NMSJ) and Gamini Viyangoda, the co-convener of Puravesi Balaya Social Movement had filed this contempt of Court action naming GMOA President Dr.Anuruddha Padeniya as the respondent.
President’s Counsel Upul Jayasuriya with counsel Chithrananda Liyanage appearing for the petitioners stated that upon the delivery of the said judgment by Court of Appeal, the GMOA has condemned and openly criticized the said judgment demanding to annulment or setting aside of the said judgment.
Jayasuriya further stated that in this backdrop the GMOA headed by Dr. Padeniya has called for a national front and trade union action against SAITM following Court decision in ordering SAITM medical graduates to be registered with the SLMC.
The petitioners stated that on or about April 7, 2017 the GMOA had organised islandwide trade union action against SAITM halting all health services including private practice and private health services to stress on the Government to abolish SAITM.
The petitioners stated that the contemptuous statements and comments demonstrate the blatant hatred of the respondent and publication of the same in the said speech indubitably disturbs the Court process and hampers and undermines the authority of the Court of Appeal in respect of the administration of justice especially in view of the fact that the said speech was published and telecast on several medias and has been uttered by the respondent in a public meeting held under topic of “Abolish the SAITM” on April 4, 2017.
The petitioners are pleading that Dr. Padeniya be charged on the offence of Contempt of Court of Appeal under Article 105 (3) of the constitution of the Republic of Sri Lanka. They are further seeking an Interim Order restraining and preventing GMOA President from committing, making or publishing further contemptuous statements/articles scandalizing the Court of Appeal until the conclusion of this case. They further urge to impose sentence on the respondent as provided for in Article 105(3) of the Constitution.
