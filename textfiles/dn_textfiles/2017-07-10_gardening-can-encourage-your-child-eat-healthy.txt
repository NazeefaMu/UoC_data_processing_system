Gardening can encourage your child to eat healthy

With childhood and adolescent obesity touching alarming levels across the globe, experts are warning about the health complications that accompany this ailment. Obesity leads to a number of other problems, including diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, among others. While maintaining an active lifestyle and eating a healthy, balanced diet are important, a new study has revealed that growing plants reduces childhood obesity.
The logic behind this, say experts, is that spending time outdoors will not only teach your child how to garden but also have a positive impact on their mental health, which, in turn, will promote healthy eating. The study said that overweight children, who take up gardening, are more likely to lose weight in just one year.
Senior bariatric and metabolic surgeon, Dr Ramen Goel, explains, "This is a very interesting study. It links cognitive functions with the health of an individual. The numbers are really small but this is an exciting concept nonetheless. This can be easily replicated and verified in the Indian scenario. Considering the galloping obesity epidemic we are currently facing, any non-interventional preventive approach is welcome."
Another study has revealed that kids who regularly eat veggies score better in writing and spelling tests. This is because vegetables are packed with antioxidants that maintain DNA — excellent for the brain. -Time of India
