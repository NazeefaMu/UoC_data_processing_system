Malik meets Czech leaders

The business community and the government officials of the Czech Republic have expressed their interest in making investments in Sri Lanka in manufacturing for the automobile sector and linking their products to the supply chain to the Indian subcontinent.
This was indicated to the Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade, Malik Samarawickrama by the Czech business delegation during a recent visit by him to Prague. Minister Samarawickrama also met with senior Czech officials to discuss expanding trade and investment between the two countries. 
Bilateral trade between the two countries is currently just US$ 30 million, with Sri Lankan exports to Czech being primarily in apparels and rubber tyres. FDI between the two countries is virtually non-existent.
Minister Samarawickrama met with Petr Ocko, Deputy Minister, Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Czech Republic, Miloslav Stasek, State Secretary, Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic, and Milan Štech, President of the Senate.
The two sides committed to increasing bilateral trade and investment in the coming years, through more engagement both at the political, as well as business-to-business, level.
