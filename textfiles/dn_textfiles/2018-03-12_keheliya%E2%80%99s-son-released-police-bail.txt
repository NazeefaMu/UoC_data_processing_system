Keheliya’s son released on police bail

Ramith Rambukwella who was arrested on charges of drunk driving and assaulting two undergraduates, was released on police bail yesterday.
The arrest was made by the Narahenpita Police near the Open University, Nawala, last Friday.
He was produced before the Hulftsdorp Magistrate on Saturday. He is to appear before the magistrate’s court again tomorrow.
Rambukwella represents the Tamil Union in first class cricket and has played for Sri Lanka in two T20 matches. He was previously involved in a controversial incident where he allegedly tried to open an aircraft door at 35,000 feet.
He is the son of Kandy district Parliamentarian Keheliya Rambukwella.
