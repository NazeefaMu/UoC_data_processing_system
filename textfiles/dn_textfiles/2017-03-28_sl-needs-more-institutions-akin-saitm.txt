SL needs more institutions akin to SAITM

Sri Lanka should open higher educational institutions like the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) in Malabe and not try to close them or entice the government on taking over them, said Sri Lankan born Dr. Shirani M. Perera now based in USA .
On a holiday in Sri Lanka she said that unwanted controversies created on this issue is not at all acceptable. “Look, Sri Lanka needs more doctors and what is wrong in private universities producing them. Some of the Sri Lankan doctors who are practicing in Sri Lanka also have had their education in foreign medical colleges. If they can learn in private universities in foreign countries why the local universities can’t produce them,” she asked.
She also said that sending a child for medical education overseas is a very costly affair for a Sri Lankan parent and it also drains foreign exchange out of Sri Lanka. She said universities of this nature can fill the vacuum of doctors and also attract foreign students to study in them and earn foreign exchange.
Dr. Shirani who is also the Assistant Professor, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, USA said however that standards should be maintained in medical education, examinations as well as in the entry levels.
Dr. Shirani also said she was very surprised to note that Sri Lankan doctors do not pay taxes during private practice in Sri Lanka unlike in the US and some other countries.
