Colombo Fort – Talaimannar train limited to Medawachchiya

 
The Sri Lanka Railway Department has decided to temporarily terminate the Colombo Fort-Talaimannar train at Medawachchiya for a week in effect from today.
Railway Department Superintendant Vijeya Samarasinghe said that the decision was made to replace the old bridge between Veddikulama and Madawachchiya with a new one.
With this, trains will only function from Colombo Fort - Medawachchiya and vice versa.
