Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince Harry join together to 'shatter the stigma' of mental illness

 
Attitudes to mental health in Britain are now at a "tipping point", the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry have said, as they sign up a host of high-profile public figures to help "shatter the stigma".
The senior Royals launched the next stage of their Heads Together campaign on Thursday: a series of ten videos designed to spark "simple conversations" about mental health.
Starring the likes of Freddie Flintoff, Ruby Wax, Stephen Manderson - better known as the musician Professor Green - and Alastair Campbell, the videos are part of the Royals' ongoing battle to break down the "walls of judgement" they perceive to be standing in the way of progress.
In a joint statement, the Duke, Duchess and Prince Harry said:  "Since we launched Heads Together last May, we have seen time and time again that shattering stigma on mental health starts with simple conversations.
"When you realise that mental health problems affect your friends, neighbours, children and spouses, the walls of judgement and prejudice around these issues begin to fall.
"And we all know that you cannot resolve a mental health issue by staying silent.
"Attitudes to mental health are at a tipping point. We hope these films show people how simple conversations can change the direction of an entire life. Please share them with your friends and families and join us in a national conversation on mental health in the weeks ahead."
The videos, published online, are the next step in a building campaign which will next month culminate in the London Marathon, where around 700 runners including the Telegraph's Bryony Gordon will embark on 26.2 miles in aid of the charity.
A further 39,000 branded headbands will be available to any other runner who wishes to show their support for Heads Together, in recognition of how mental health affects copious other good causes.
The Duke, Duchess and Prince Harry are understood to have actively explored taking part in the marathon themselves, but will not be running on April 23.
The Duchess has previously said: "I think there might be a few security issues..."
The trio have each spent months emphasising the importance of speaking about mental health, with the Duchess last week talking frankly about the lack of confidence she suffered after becoming a new mother.
Prince Harry, who underwent a training course to help people suffering mental health crises when he worked in the Army's personal recovery unit, has campaigned for those in the armed forces to stop feeling ashamed about admitting they have a problem.
And the Duke of Cambridge has taken courses on mental health issues as part of his work as an air ambulance pilot. The video series, which will be launched on Facebook, Twitter and Google and followed by new films each week, has been made by directors including Stephen Frears, the man behind The Queen, Philomena and Dangerous Liaisons. Ruby Wax will talk to her husband, director Ed Bye, about the moment she revealed she was "mentally ill" moments before they tied the knot in a registry office, while Alastair Campbell discusses his nervous breakdown and depression with wife Fiona.
Flintoff and Manderson are filmed together discussing their own battles with their minds, while newsreader Mark Austin discusses anorexia with his daughter Maddy.
Other films show new mothers, ambulance drivers and Royal Marines talking about their experiences, in a bid to encourage others to do the same.
Paul Farmer, chief executive of Mind, one of the Heads Together charity partners, said: “It is truly groundbreaking to see so many people, from all walks of life, sharing their mental health experiences on film in the hope of inspiring others to strike up their own conversation.
"These films have the power to spark life-changing and, in some cases, life-saving conversations. We hope that there will be a snowball effect with more and more people seeing the benefits of speaking out and supporting each other.” Stephan Shakespeare, CEO of YouGov which has published a study into mental health, said: “The nation is at a tipping point in our willingness to talk openly about mental health, and it is young people who are taking the lead."
