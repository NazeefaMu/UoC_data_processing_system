OMI present scholarships to undergraduates

Those who get selected to continue their higher studies at a university level are a privileged lot over many others. Though many are qualified to enter university, owing to restrictions such as the lack of space to accommodate and provide other facilities, only a selected lot get the opportunity enter universities.
Hence, those who are privileged to enter universities and receive the 'De Mazenod Scholarships' are requested to concentrate on their studies and not to waste precious time for other things, said Rev. Fr. Dennis Iddamalgoda, OMI—the man behind the De Mazenod Scholarship Foundation. Addressing the recipients of the 'De Mazenod Scholarship,' at the ceremony held at the Centre for Society and Religion(CSR), Maradana, on June 24, Fr. Iddamalgoda said that money to grant scholarships to the most deserving poor students selected for university studies are provided with hard-earned money, working overseas.
The scholarships are given not to play and waste money and time, but to come out one day with success, to be useful and responsible citizens of Sri Lanka.
Fr. Dennis went on to say the Foundation selected undergraduates purely on merit, irrespective of their religion or ethnicity. He added that the target of the De Mazenod Scholarship Foundation is to provide scholarships to 100 students.
Rev. Frs. Justin Silva, Angelo Wijewickrema and Ajith Wellington, also addressed the ceremony.
