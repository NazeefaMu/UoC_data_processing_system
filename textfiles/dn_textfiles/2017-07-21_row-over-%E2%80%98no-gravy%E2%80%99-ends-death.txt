Row over ‘no gravy’ ends in death

A row over ‘no gravy’ at the dinner table resulted in the death of one elderly woman and caused grievous injuries to another middle aged woman and her young daughter.
A 42-year-old man from Mahawela, Matale area had reportedly hacked to death his mother-in-law and also attacked his 39-year-old wife and 20-year-old daughter, after he found there was not a single serving with gravy on the dinner table.
The mother and daughter who have been admitted to the Matale hospital is said to be in a critical condition. The man had fled the area following the attack and police have launched a manhunt..
A neighbour, an eyewitness to the incident, said she had heard heated arguments from the deceased person’s house and had gone to see what was happening.
“When I approached the house I saw ‘Wije’ attacking his wife with a large knife. Then his mother-in-law and daughter also came running from inside pleading with him to stop. He then attacked both of them with the same weapon as well,” a neighbour said.
“Then, I too went in and shouted at ‘Wije’ to stop attacking his family. But he turned on me as well and threatened to kill me if I did not leave’. He seemed to be under the influence of liquor. He was complaining about not having a single serving with gravy for dinner,” she said.
Also she said that ‘Wije’s wife who was seriously injured had returned to Sri Lanka only on the 14th of this month after working in a middle eastern country. The Police are conducting investigations.
