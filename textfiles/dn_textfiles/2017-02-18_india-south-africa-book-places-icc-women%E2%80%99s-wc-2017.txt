India, South Africa book places in ICC Women’s WC 2017

India and South Africa completed comprehensive victories in the ICC Women’s World Cup Qualifier 2017 yesterday to become the first two teams from the tournament to qualify for the ICC Women’s World Cup 2017 to be held in England and Wales from 24 June to 23 July.
India scored a nine-wicket win over Bangladesh to maintain an unbeaten record in the tournament and take its Super Six points tally to eight, including for two wins against other qualifiers from its preliminary league group, points of which are carried over.
South Africa beat host Sri Lanka by nine wickets to go up to six points, which will take it through since the chances of a five-way tie are eliminated after yesterday’s result.
In another match, Pakistan scored an 86-run win over Ireland and kept in contention for the remaining two qualifying spots with four points, the same as Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka who scored a creditable win over Pakistan two days ago, were outplayed yesterday at the P Sara Oval by South Africa and their chances of qualifying for the World Cup will depend heavily on their final game against Bangladesh on Sunday.
Winning the toss and batting first Sri Lanka could muster only a poor 142-9 in 50 overs the batting falling to the leg-spin of Sune Luus and captain Dane van Niekerk who between them shared five scalps.
Top scorer for Sri Lanka was opener Nipuni Hansika with a composed 48 off 96 balls.
South African made short work of the target of 143 getting theier in 36.1 overs with Luus producing a fine all-round performance following her figures of 3 for 40 with an unbeaten half century to take the Player of the Match award.
OTHER MATCHES
At the NCC grounds India made short work of its challenge as it restricted Bangladesh to 155 for eight with pace bowler Mansi Joshi and leg-spinner Devika Vaidya keeping control through the innings, sharing five scalps. Fargana Hoque top-scored for Bangladesh with 50.
India got to 158 for one in 33.3 overs with opener Mona Meshram striking a career-best 78 not out with 12 fours to take the Player of the Match award and captain Mithali Raj compiling 73 not out with 10 fours for a 43rd ODI half-century.
In another match at the CCC grounds, Pakistan put up a determined effort to post an intimidating 271 for five after electing to bat against Ireland.
In-form batters Javeria Khan (90 not out) and opener Nahida Khan (72) played positively for their second consecutive half-centuries after scoring 64 and 63, respectively, in a loss against Sri Lanka.
Javeria struck 14 fours and Nahida hit 10 fours in her career-best knock as the pair figured in a 138-run second-wicket partnership.
Nain Abidi also chipped in with a brisk 44 to help push Ireland out of contention for a top-four berth since it has no points in the Super Six with only one match to go.
Ireland was bowled out for 185 with a 74-run second-wicket stand between Cecelia Joyce (41) and Kim Garth (33) being the high point of the innings. For Pakistan, leg-spinner Nashra Sandhu, left-arm spinner Sadia Yousuf and captain and off-spinner Sana Mir all grabbed two wickets each.
