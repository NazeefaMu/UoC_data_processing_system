Cricket like any sport has several rules, some are common others rarely come into use.
Most of the rules make sense, while there are some uncanny ones, for which we always wonder why do they exist.
Here we take a look at some of cricket's weird rules that most of you might not be aware of.

FORFEITING INNINGS OF A TEST MATCH
You can forfeit an entire innings of a Test.
One famous incident, that occurred in the past, was between England and South Africa in 2000.

South Africa forfeited their second innings while England forfeited their first innings.
