I was not hesitant to romance a megastar

Gorgeous actress Kajal Agarwal has a prominent place in South Indian cinema. She hiked remuneration recently because of which she struggled a lot to get impressive roles. However she turned an item girl with Janatha Garage which impressed the audience big time. Kajal has been roped in to romance Megastar Chiranjeevi in his comeback film titled ‘Khaidi No 150’. This has been quite unusual for the audience as Kajal romanced Chiru’s son Ramcharan and their combination turned out to be highly successful. The audience set some boundaries for any film and beyond the boundaries is something risky.
