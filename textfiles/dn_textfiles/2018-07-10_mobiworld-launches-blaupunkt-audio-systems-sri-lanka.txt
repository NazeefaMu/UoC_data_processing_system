Mobiworld launches Blaupunkt audio systems in Sri Lanka

Mobiworld (Pvt) Ltd has launched globally iconic, German-made Blaupunkt Audio Systems in Sri Lanka.
Starting operations more than 95 years ago, with a singular commitment to providing the highest level of services to customers, Blaupunkt, or blue dot, has consistently expanded its reach, scope and expertise, now serving consumers worldwide. Today, its Global Brand Community encompasses strategic locations worldwide, with current and ongoing expansion, via Mobiworld, into one of the largest retail networks in Sri Lanka.
As the exclusive distributor for Blaupunkt Audio Systems in Sri Lanka, Mobiworld will initially launch three internationally popular products in the local market, all of which will be available through a sales network encompassing over 1,000 retail outlets island-wide.
The first Blaupunkt Audio Systems available in Sri Lanka will comprise BT01 (3W) and BT51 (8W) Bluetooth speakers, and the SBW01 (80W) Sound Bar.
A top-firing speaker that provides optimum sound level and quality, the BT01 is 40mm in size with a weight of 290g and 400mah battery power, and a playtime of up to 4 hours. It has a Silicon Gel cover that gives it a premium look, and comes in two color options, black or blue.
A more upscale product, featuring a passive radiator for a super bass effect, the BT51 is a 40mm-in-diameter, easy-to-carry rectangular speaker that weighs 586g. It consists of 1500mah battery power, which provides up to 10 hours of playing time.
Additionally, both speakers provide 32GB SD card support allowing storage for up to 10,000 songs.
Commenting on Blaupunkt Audio Systems’ entry into Sri Lanka, Mobiworld (Pvt) Ltd Managing Director Sanjeev Ariaratnam said, “We are pleased to introduce to Sri Lanka the high quality German brand Blaupunkt Audio Systems, which is globally respected for offering unparalleled audio experiences. Further, to ensure you receive only superior quality, genuine products when you buy Blaupunkt Audio Systems from Mobiworld, we will introduce a one to one replacement guarantee for our valued customers.”
Adding to this, Envent World CEO Sukhesh Madaan said, “Blaupunkt Audio Systems’ entry into Sri Lanka, and our partnership with Mobiworld, will open up a whole new world of choice for audiophiles locally, giving them access to products that offer higher quality, precision German innovation and engineering.”
