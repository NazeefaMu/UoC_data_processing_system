Herath bruises bowling hand

GALLE: Rangana Herath the stand-in captain for Dinesh Chandimal for the ongoing first Test against India at the Galle International Stadium suffered a bruised left middle finger on the third day of play yesterday.
Herath tried to stop a hard drive by Indian captain Virat Kohli at extra cover and was forced to go off the field. “Rangana was hit on the same finger where he suffered a fracture three years ago. We can’t see a fracture. We took an x-ray. If the pain continues, then we will do a MRI scan. At this stage we are icing and we will know in the morning,” said Sri Lanka cricket manager Asanka Gurusinha.
“At this stage he is not going to go to Colombo or anything. We’ll see if he could bowl tomorrow. It was the middle finger in his left-hand.
We feel it’s a bruise.” – ST
