Ravi renews challenge to MR

A former President who has been accused of exploiting the controversial bond issue should go before Court. His proxies have nothing to do with it, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said.
Responding to a statement by MP MP Bandula Gunawardana, Finance Minister Karunanayake renewed his challenge to the former President during a media briefing at the Finance Ministry recently.
MP Gunawardana said earlier that he would go to Courts on behalf of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Minister Karunanayake said: "If Bandula Gunawardana or Prof. G.L. Peries who held portfolios in the previous government are preparing to go to Court, there is no meaning in the attempt.
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said recently that he would take legal action against the allegations that he acted dishonestly in issuing treasury bonds. Responding to his statement, Minister Karunanayake challenged the former President to go to Courts against the allegations if he has guts to do so.
“I challenged former President Rajapaksa to go to Court if the allegations against him are wrong. He said he would go. Statements by Bandula Gunawardana and G.L. Peries to answer the issue on behalf of Rajapaksa would not be acceptable. Rajapaksa, as the previous Finance Minister is responsible for the signatures which endorsed those gazette notifications," Minister Karunanayake said.
