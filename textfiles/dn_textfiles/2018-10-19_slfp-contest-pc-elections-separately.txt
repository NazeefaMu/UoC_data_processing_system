SLFP to contest PC elections separately

UPFA General Secretary and Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said yesterday that SLFP will be contesting as a separate party at the forthcoming Provincial Council election.
He was addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday.
He said the SLFP Central Committee recently had a lengthy discussion on the reorganization of the party. “We are reorganising and restructuring the party,” he said.
The Minister said that several weak organisers who are not working for the party have been removed and new organisers will be appointed shortly.
