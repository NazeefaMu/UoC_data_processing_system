IGP should probe bribery claims-Champika,Rajitha

 
Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne and Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka had requested IGP N.K. Illangakoon to probe the allegations made by Avant Garde Maritime Security Services Chairman Major (Retd) Nissanka Senadhipathi that the two ministers had solicited bribes.

Writing to IGP Illangakoon they said that Major Senadhipathi had told the media that four ministers in the current government, who wanted money from him during the election times charged that Rakna Araksha Lanka Limited (RALL) having control is merely a front and that they are mere bystanders while Avant Garde is actually in charge in the guise of administrators as he was refused to fund them.
He had also noted that he has enough records to prove it if they want to do so.
In some media Senadhipathi has mentioned the names of Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne and Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka as the ministers who had solicited bribes.
The ministers said these allegations were baseless and they have never asked money from Nissanka Senadhipathi or anyone who attached to the Avant Garde.
“We talked against Avant Garde Maritime security Services, because of its so-called maritime security procedure. Nothing against Nissanka Senadhipathi or his private deals and businesses”, the ministers stated.
According to the letter that the ministers sent to the IGP, there is no veiled license to Maritime Security Services (Pvt) Ltd to keep firearms and explosives. They have noted that keeping such huge stock of weapons illegally can be a threat to the state security. The Avant Garde has involved in several agreements with foreign countries including Nigeria which government should be involved and it can be created diplomatic issues. They have taken money which should receive by local trainee sea marshals and they have grabbed huge amounts of money which should receive to the government.
Minister Senaratne and Minister Ranawaka are requesting IGP N K Illangakoon to probe the allegations made by Senadhipathi and the facts which they have mentioned in their letter and take immediate actions to put the law in to action.
