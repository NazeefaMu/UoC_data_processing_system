Bodies washed ashore in Jaffna identified

Two bodies that washed ashore on the Pungudutivu beach in Jaffna, on June 13 afternoon, were identified to be that of two brothers who had set out fishing from Thalaimannar, on June 8.
The identification was made by their relatives when Kayts police had handed the two bodies over to the Jaffna Teaching Hospital for a postmortem examination.
The deceased are 37-year-old T. Christine Kungya and 32-year-old T. Emaran Kungya of Thalaimannar west.
They had set out on the expedition, ignoring weather warnings issued for fishermen in the area. Investigations are continuing.
