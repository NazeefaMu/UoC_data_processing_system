Ceylinco Insurance placed at pinnacle by key business ranking indices

Ceylinco Insurance PLC was chosen as Sri Lanka’s best insurer by not only one but several key business ranking indices recently.
Ceylinco Insurance was chosen amongst Sri Lanka’s Best 20 Brands and is incidentally the only insurance company selected amongst the elite list of brands by Interbrands, the world’s leading brand listing agency.
Having pioneered brand valuation in 1988, Interbrand has a deep understanding of the impact that a strong brand has on key stakeholder groups to influence the growth of a business, namely, both current and prospective customers, employees and investors.
Once again, for the fifth consecutive year, Ceylinco Insurance earned the honour of being the only insurance company amongst the ‘Business Today Top 30’ companies in Sri Lanka. As announced in its edition for 2016/17, Ceylinco Insurance moved up the corporate ladder to the 12th position, achieving a truly unique feat.
According to Business Today, financial information reviewed for the selection process covered several aspects which included revenue, share turnover, profit after tax, growth in turnover, growth in profit, return on equity, growth in earnings per share, market capitalization, value of shares transacted and value additions.
Ceylinco Insurance reiterated its position as the highest ranked insurance company in Sri Lanka for the 23rd consecutive year.
The LMD 100 listing announced in December 2017 placed Ceylinco Insurance in the 25th position among all listed companies in the island. Since the inception of the LMD ranking, Ceylinco Insurance has maintained its supremacy by occupying the top position among insurance companies.
Ajith Gunawardena, Managing Director / CEO of Ceylinco Insurance PLC said, “We feel a humble pride as we have been recognized not only on one occasion but many.
We extend our deep gratitude to all our customers, shareholders, staff, and other stakeholders for the trust and confidence placed in us. The company understands the aspirations of its stakeholders and will ensure its future growth strategy fulfills these aspirations while enhancing quality of life for our customers”.
R Renganathan, Managing Director of Ceylinco Life, commenting on the achievements said that these results reflect the commitment displayed by the employees and that the company will continue to provide protection to the people of Sri Lanka.
