Help where it’s due

School children should not only indulge in their day to day educational activities, but also they must know about the value of learning ethics which helps to improve their moral principles to become viable citizens in the society.
These are some of the comments made by Principal, Angel International School, Manipay, Jaffna, Dr. Noel Vimalendran during an awareness programme, conducted for schoolchildren on the `Value of Elders’. HelpAge Sri Lanka, Youth Education Division sponsored the programme.
Making an emotional speech on elders, Principal Vimalendran highlighted the hardships faced by many Senior Citizens in the country due to lack of attention paid by others .
He also commended the invaluable service rendered by HelpAge Sri Lanka (HASL) towards such underprivileged citizens and said even the children of Angel International School are taught to care one another like HelpAge encourages children to help elders.
Addressing over 800 students, Principal Vimalendran stressed the importance of treating Senior Citizens considering that they shed sweat and toil to develop our motherland in the past. In addition to school children, teachers and staff members, HelpAge officials Geethal Mendis, Lionel Premachandra and Ananda Kannangara were also present on the occasion.
The Principal also called upon students of Angel International school to entertain elders during their twilight days without isolating them by sending them to elders homes.
“As the concept of HelpAge Sri Lanka, it is also our paramount duty to help elders to lead dignified ,secure, active and healthy lives considering that these citizens are not a burden but a valuable asset in a society,”.
He also called upon countrywide schools to be partners of this programme and requested HelpAge to conduct such programmes in other schools too. After listening to the emotional speech made by the Principal on the value of elders, a teacher of Angel International School volunteered herself to extend services to HelpAge work in the future.
HelpAge Youth Education Director Geethal Mendis explained the school children on social work rendered by HelpAge to uplift the living standards of underprivileged Senior Citizens by providing them with free medical services, free cataract surgeries and also financial assistance to engage in livelihood activities.
Director Mendis also quoted several leading personalities in the international arena including the former American President Barack Obama and said how he looked after his grandmother until her demise.
He said even the late British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher once said that everybody in today’s world should think that we all are getting old one day and therefore we should learn to help each other from younger days.
“Therefore, I would once again make a fervent request from all students to treat their elders considering it as a noble cause,” he added.
