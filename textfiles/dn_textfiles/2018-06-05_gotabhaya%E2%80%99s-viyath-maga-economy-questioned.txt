Gotabhaya’s Viyath Maga economy questioned

State Minister Harsha de Silva yesterday expressed his concern over the Socialist Market Economy promoted by former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa in his Viyath Maga Movement.
Dr. De Silva questioned if Gotabhaya’s socialist market economy implies that it promotes the kind of economy that was introduced in China in 1990s.
“A main concerns raised over the socialist market economy introduced in China is that all the dividends earned by the public sector going to a fund owned by the Communist Party of China. The dividends are not sent to the Treasury but to a political party. So the question who owns the country’s economy rises.” Dr. De Silva said.
Dr. De Silva pointed out that Gotabhaya Rajapaksa did not define what he meant by a socialist market economy. If this is the kind of economy Viyath Maga promotes, Dr. De Silva questioned, if the Rajapaksas are trying to take the public assets of the country under control of their family or a political party headed by them.
Contrary to what Viyath Maga promotes, State Minister Harsha de Silva said. the UNP promotes a Social Market Economic policy primarily based on efficiency and social justice.
Dr. De Silva was speaking at the launching ceremony of “Sathya” (Truth) Campaign and the UNP Central Media Unit held at Sirikotha yesterday afternoon.
Meanwhile, Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera also made several observations on Viyath Maga. He sees Viyath Maga as a “Vipath Maga” (a way towards destruction). He also said that former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa “ if left with any kind of self-respect, should leave Sri Lanka and go back to his motherland without causing disturbances in the country.”
Minister Samaraweera said that the electricity bill of a luxury house built near the Menik Ganga is directed to former Defence Secretary’s name. If the house is not owned by Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, why would the Ceylon Electricity Board issue the bill under his name, Minister Samaraweera questioned.
Minister Samaraweera also said that it has been alleged that Gotabhaya Rajapaksa used army officers to build this palace of a house, while he was the Defence Secretary of the ex-regime.
