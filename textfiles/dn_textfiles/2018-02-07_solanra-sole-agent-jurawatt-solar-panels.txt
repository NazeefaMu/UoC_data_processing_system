Solanra sole agent for  Jurawatt Solar panels

Solanra has met their target of contributing to the national electricity grid with 1000 kilo watts power within one year using German made Jurawatt solar panels.
Solanra commissioned in 2012 is the sole agent in Sri Lanka for Jurawatt solar panels, world’s number one German solar panel for tropical countries and geographical locations with desserts.
Solanra recently held a felicitation ceremony at Grand Monarch hotel, Thalawatugoda to appreciate its loyal customers towards the object of adding 1000 kilowatts electricity to the national grid before end of 2017. The event was graced by Solanra Company’s CEO Kingsley Jayawardene, who is a senior electrical engineer and an experienced consultant in renewable energy for European countries.
Each Jurawatt solar panel installed by the Solanra has a 35 year warranty. These solar panels are the most suited ones for extreme climatic and geographical conditions that prevail in Sri Lanka.
Jurawatt solar panels have many unique attributes that other solar panels being used in the country do not have. Its core competency is it has 125 centigrade Maximum Absorb Temperature. Usually in Sri Lanka absorbed solar panels temperature increasesabove 80 centigrade. Solar panels with the capacity to absorb highertemperature fail in functioning as a result and reduce their lifetime by years.
In addition, the Austrian made Fronius Inverter used with Juarawatt solar panels has the ability to generate power even at a time when there is very little sunlight.
It generates power from 6am to 6pm. Thus it is super flex design and perfect answer to irregularly shaped or different roof orientations and Fronius inverter has WLAN or Ethernet internet connection to monitor remotely..
Jurawatt solar panel also has ‘self-cleaning’ mechanism to clean bird droppings and dust plus the strength to safeguard its components against animals like monkeys that intrude. All components are made in Germany and the frame around the solar panel is made with special Aluminium alloy material with a warranty. In addition Jurawatt panels generate 30 percent more power when compared with common solar panels in the market.
Solanra Managing Director, Shirley Jayawardene, commented, “Jurawatt solar panel sold by our company is the best product for tropical countries and it is already endorsed by our loyal customers and service providers who are being felicitated today”.
“Common solar panels in the marketplace could absorb only a temperature of 85 centigrade. But in many seasons we experience temperature rising to greater levels.”
