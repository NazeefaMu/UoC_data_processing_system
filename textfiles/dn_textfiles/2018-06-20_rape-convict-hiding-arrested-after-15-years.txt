Rape convict in hiding arrested after 15 years

The Hungama police apprehended a person who was in hiding for 15 years after being convicted of rape, on Monday.
The 55 year old person was arrested in 1990 and sentenced to 15 years rigorous imprisonment by the Hambantota magistrate's court. He was later released in 1999 by the Tangalle magistrate's court after filing an appeal. The person had gone into hiding after the Tangalle magistrate's court recorded the same sentence in 2003.
The person was arrested when he came to receive treatment from the Kandy hospital. The suspect is scheduled to be produced before the Tangalle High Court.
