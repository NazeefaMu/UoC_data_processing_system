Type 3c diabetes misdiagnosed

Most people are familiar with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Recently, though, a new type of diabetes has been identified as type 3c diabetes.
Type 1 diabetes is where the body’s immune system destroys the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas. It usually starts in childhood or early adulthood and almost always needs insulin treatment. Type 2 diabetes occurs when the pancreas can’t keep up with the insulin demand of the body. It is often associated with being overweight or obese and usually starts in middle or old age, although the age of onset is decreasing.
Type 3c diabetes is caused by damage to the pancreas from inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), tumours of the pancreas, or pancreatic surgery. This type of damage to the pancreas not only impairs the organ’s ability to produce insulin but also to produce the proteins needed to digest food (digestive enzymes) and other hormones.
However, our latest study has revealed that most cases of type 3c diabetes are being wrongly diagnosed as type 2 diabetes.
Small studies in specialist centres have found that most people with type 3c diabetes need insulin and, unlike with other diabetes types, can also benefit from taking digestive enzymes with food. These are taken as a tablet with meals and snacks.
Researchers and specialist doctors have recently become concerned that type 3c diabetes might be much more common than previously thought and that many cases are not being correctly identified. It was found that in adults, type 3c diabetes was more common than type 1 diabetes. One per cent of new cases of diabetes in adults were type 1 diabetes compared with 1.6 per cent for type 3c diabetes.
People with type 3c diabetes were twice as likely to have poor blood sugar control, than those with type 2 diabetes. They were also five to 10 times more likely to need insulin, depending on their type of pancreas disease.
The onset of type 3c diabetes could occur long after the onset of pancreas injury – in many cases more than a decade later. This long lag may be one of the reasons the two events are not often thought of as being linked, and the diagnosis of type 3c diabetes is being overlooked.
Correctly identifying the type of diabetes is important as it helps the selection of the correct treatment. Several drugs used for type 2 diabetes such as gliclazide may not be as effective in type 3c diabetes. Misdiagnosis, therefore, can waste time and money attempting ineffective treatments while exposing the patient to high blood sugar levels. Our findings highlight the urgent need for improved recognition and diagnosis of this surprisingly common type of diabetes.
