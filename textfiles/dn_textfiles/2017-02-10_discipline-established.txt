Discipline established

Sakyamuni Sri Siddhartha Gauthama Buddha out of compassion for suffering humanity realized the truth of suffering and the path to happiness. He set out on his quest to discover the cause of repeated births and deaths in the never ending cycle of Samsara. It was quite a success. The summit of perfection which he attained with his own endeavours was for the entire humanity. The Buddha knew seven persons who could understand his Dhamma. When he surveyed the world with his divine eye, he found that his first two teachers had passed away.
But the five ascetic friends who had been with him at Uruvela were there, now residing at Deer Park in Isipatana. Then Noble Mission, he proceeded to Saranath and delivered his first sermon to his onetime colleagues who were of the view that he had failed in his attempts to find the supreme truth and had determined to retrain from greeting and welcoming him. But as he came closer, it was not possible.
They were so impressed that they, at once respected him with reverence. As soon as Buddha spoke the mother earth trembled creating many miraculous marvels. Thus he delivered his first sermon and set in motion the wheel of Dhamma. Ven Kondanna was the first disciple to attain the eye of Dhamma. The others too became Arahats later. They, thus became the first disciples establishing Buddha Sasana. The foundation for the Sangha was laid. Later Yasakulaputra and his 55 disciples attained Arahantship. He then addressed the 60 Arahanths to fulfill the sasanic tour. “Go forth Bhikkus into the world taking the message to them, Explain to them, what I have explained for the wellbeing of the majority.”
Then the Buddha himself set out for Rajagaha, having sent them on the great mission of preaching the doctrine of the Dhamma. On his way he met the hermit monks – the three brothers Uruwela, Nadi and Gaya Kashyapa together with their 1000 disciples at Uruwela, Senanigama. There he preached the doctrine and helped them to attain Arahantship.
The next notable event was the arrival of the two youths who were destined to become two great Arahats next to Buddha – the two friends Kolitha Upatissa who belonged to leading families of the day. They came with their retinue numbering 250. They all obtained the eye of Dhamma. Here they got the unique opportunity of entering the order. The Buddha assembled the 1250 Bhikkhus to one place and pronounced Kolitha and Upatissa the Chief disciples of the Sasana, naming them as Sariputta and Moggallana. This event occurred on the Navam Full Moon day.
The Buddha explained that they received permission (Niyata Vivarana)from a previous Buddha Anomadassi who with his divine vision had predicted that they would be the next chief disciples in the sasana. This supreme position was extremely pious lives led throughout sansara by the two friends and the culmination was on the Navam Poya day.
The period of two decades since the enlightenment of the Sakyamuni Gauthama Buddha, the Vinaya – the code of discipline of the Sangha community is said to be par-excellent. Hence there was no necessity or any urgency for enacting rules and regulations. The Sangha then devoted their full time and energy to concentrate on Dhamma as the achievement of perfection in Seela was what was expected of them.
The disciples were leading of life of pretty and sanctity. They listened with utmost faith to the sermons of the Buddha and the Magha Puja which falls usually in the month of Navam was a reflection of the Sangha. It signifies the early period of the establishment of the Sangha, commemorating the day when 1250 Arahants came together to listen to his Dhamma. It was on this day that the Buddha preached the discourse known as Ovada Patimokkha which established the tradition of Sangha coming together before the rules of Vinaya.
This is referred to as the basis and foundation of the Buddha’s teachings and was delivered on the first Navam Full Moon day after the enlightenment. This is said to have created a very disciplined and orderly Sangha Samaja to preserve the doctrine.
When Sakyamuni Gauthama was getting rid for the final journey known as ‘Aayu Sanskara’ Ven Ananda Thera who was the closest to Buddha failed for a moment to extend his invitation to live further. His failure to do so gave the opportunity to Mara, to fulfill his objective of seeing the end of the Thathagatha. He complied with the request of Mara with universal love and compassion towards all beings, leaving behind the great doctrine. Aaya Sanskara was determined on this Navam Full Moon day in the Buddhist Calendar.
