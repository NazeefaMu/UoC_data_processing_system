BIA changes flight schedule

The SriLankan Airlines changed its departure and arrival times of several flights at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) to let launch an experimental flight over the Indian Ocean on Saturday.
The statement said the inconvenience was caused by “the launch of an experimental flight over the Indian Ocean by a regional country” and it was “beyond airline’s control.”
The Duty Officer said that no other changes to flight schedules were made.
