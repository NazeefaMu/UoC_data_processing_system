Entrust Securities has been borrowing money from CB: Commission

The Entrust Securities, a primary dealer which has allegedly been involved in large scale frauds and mismanagement, has been borrowing money from the Central Bank with no government securities,it was revealed at the Commission inquiring into the Treasury Bond issue yesterday.
The money invested in were from the pension funds of the Central Bank and the Ceylon Electricity Board. It was also revealed that the borrowings have been taking place from 2010 until 2015, when former Governor Arjun Mahendra took steps to look into the matter.
The Public Debt Department, which is responsible in supervising the Primary Dealers, has not reported on the mismatch in securities, Deputy Governor P.Samarasiri pointed out.
He said even though the PDD has done routine inspections on Entrust Securities, this mismatch of securities has not been observed.
Asked if he would be surprised if he is suggested that there was a close rapport between the Primary Dealers and the PDD officers, DG Samarasiri said in fact he will not be surprised.
Samarasiri was replying to a submission made by Arjun Mahendran’s Legal Counsel Chanaka de Silva.
