UNP to postpone the rally

The ‘Yukthiye Jana Satana’ rally organized by UNP has been postponed to 17th December. The rally was originally scheduled for 13th of December. UNP has decided to postpone the rally since the hearing of the petition against the dissolution of the Parliament is not yet resolved, and a verdict is expected within this week.
