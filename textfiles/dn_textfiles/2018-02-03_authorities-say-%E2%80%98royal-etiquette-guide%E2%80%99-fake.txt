Authorities say ‘royal etiquette guide’ a fake

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the British High Commission said Friday that a document circulating which gives advice on how to interact with the visiting British Royal family is fake.
The one-page guide, which is written in Sinhala, appears to be authored by a group called the “Welcome Committee of British Royals.”
But in a joint media statement, the Foreign Ministry and High Commission said the pamphlet was “not genuine,” and that no such committee had been set up.
The document contains of list of guidelines for interacting with the visiting Earl and Countess of Wessex, who are on a visit to mark the country’s 70th anniversary of Independence.
When meeting them, men should “bow down,” and women should always “curtsy,” the document says.
