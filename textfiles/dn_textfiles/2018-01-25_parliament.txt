Attack on Kataragama Police Station:
‘Former PS Chairman, supporters used brickbats causing heavy damage to vehicles, property’
After the Kataragama shooting incident on January 21 at around 12.45 am, the former Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman who is contesting from the Podu Jana Peramuna, Chanaka Amil Rangana and a group of his supporters had attacked the Kataragama Police Station with brickbats and damaged a jeep and a motorcycle.
Further, the Police Station name board, six windows of the building and other damages too were also damaged by them, said State Law and Order Minister Piyasena Gamage in Parliament yesterday.
He further said that a lorry which was detained at the Police Station was also damaged due to the attack launched by this group.
“Therefore, two teams of Police personnel had been deployed to conduct investigations into the incident, but so far the report with regard to the estimated damages caused due to the attack had not been received, he said, adding that once the reports are received, the IGP had been instructed to initiate necessary action against the perpetrators under the Public Property Act,” noted Gamage in response to a question posed by JVP MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake under Standing Orders 23/2.
Meanwhile, MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake pointed out that there is no proper signalling system for the Police to stop drivers or people travelling on roads. “In the shooting incident in Kataragama recently, the Police claim that while the rider had been ordered to stop, he had not done so. However, the villagers and the pillion rider claim that the Police had shot him while he was trying to stop. This is not the first shooting and certainly not the first such death. This sort of incident eventually results in the loss of life and impacts on innocent families. In such an instance, it is understandable that the relatives and villagers get upset and violent. If this situation could not be understood by the Police or the Government, then they don’t seem to be people of this country.”
Therefore, he said that there should be a proper signalling system enforced to indicate to the people when the Police expects them to stop. In some instances, he said they jump onto the road, flash a torch or just wave their hands. “How are we to know what the proper signal to stop is? Therefore, in the end, innocent lives are lost due to this minor issue. Hence, it is high time that the authorities come up with a proper signalling system that would indicate to drivers and road users what exactly the Police expect them to do so that we could prevent such future tragedies,” he noted.
Encroaching in our territorial waters:
Proper judicial process needed to curb invaders : Amaraweera
The process of releasing foreign fishermen who are taken into custody for entering our territorial waters and engaging in illegal fishing would only be possible through a proper judicial process and the Sri Lankan Government has suspended the provisions for foreign governments to mediate in their release, said Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera.
He said the Fisheries (Regulation of Foreign Fishing Boats) (Amendment) Bill was brought in to increase the fines for foreign fishing boats that encroach on Sri Lankan territorial waters, adding that there were other countries who were far more interested in this Bill than Sri Lanka itself.
The minister said so while moving the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill Second Reading in Parliament yesterday.
Amareweera noted that despite having a sea area of over eight times the size of Sri Lanka, we have the right to international waters, over 10,000 inland tanks and 116 lagoons in the country, we still import fish, Maldive fish, dry fish, tinned fish and sprats in large quantities. “We are trying very hard to reduce this amount. Hence increasing of fines is one such step in this endeavour. We intend to also engage in many other efforts in order to reduce the import of fish and increase the country’s exports. One of the first victories since we came into power was the lifting of the fish export ban. In comparison to 2016, fisheries exports had shown an increase of 44 percent in 2017. This year too we intend to improve this standard even further.”
The Fisheries Minister said measures have also been taken to improve and uplift the fresh water fishing industry as well. “In this respect, we intend to establish three fishing zones known as Aquaculture Industrial Parks, within the country. We have already allocated land in the North for this purpose and we hope to establish a 3,000 acre aqua industrial park in the North this year. We also intend to commence another aqua park in Batticaloa. In Hambantota we have commenced a crab city and intend to add another shortly.”
He said Rs. 1,000 million had been allocated by the Finance Ministry for the development of lagoons, while 10 of them have been identified for initial development.
He added that currently the fisheries sector is the country’s 11th highest export earner and by 2020, it was intended to reach third place. This is a difficult task but we have implemented a mechanism to reach this goal, he said.
“Previously, when a foreign fishing craft entered our waters illegally, we could only fine them an amount not more than, 1.5 million. This was a very meagre fine and as such, these foreign fishing boats did not hesitate to keep encroaching on our waters repeatedly. But now we have increased the fine from a minimum of Rs. 6 million to 175 million, through this amendment to the Act.” He said.
The minimum fine will be Rs 5 million for boats less than 15 metres, Rs 20 million for boats between 15 and 24 metres, Rs 100 million for boats between 24 and 45 metres, Rs 150 million for boats between 45 and 75 metres and Rs 175 million for boats that were more than 75 metres.
Amaraweera further noted that in addition to the fine for entering Sri Lankan waters illegally, a further fine could also be imposed if these vessels failed to store their fishing equipment properly. This fine could be between Rs. 4 million to 150 million according to the amended regulations. “There are several countries that have staged protests in this regard and even burnt my effigy. But, this is fine as we cannot implement our laws to benefit them or suit their purpose, but we have to ensure the safety and the best of interest of our local fishermen. Hence, we will not hesitate to take stern action against anyone who encroaches on our territorial waters irrespective or who they are or where they are from. Hence, if foreign vessels enter our waters and illegally fish in it, they will be charged on both counts.”
The Minister said additional fines would be imposed on foreign vessels entering the Exclusive Economic Zone of Sri Lanka without a valid permit. “Earlier, there were no fines imposed, but under new laws, fines would be imposed not less that Rs. 10 million and not exceeding 220 million. Further, if they enter our Exclusive Economic Zone and have deployed their fishing gear to engage in fishing activities, an additional fine would be imposed not less than Rs. 5 million to a maximum of Rs. 160 million. No one could object to us implementing laws to protect our country’s resources,” he said.
Lack of translators hinder Tamil weather forecasts: Anura Priyadarshana
A special programme had been introduced in September 2017, to issue weather forecasts in the Tamil language to the Electronic and Print Media twice a day at 05.30 am and 12 noon in the 25 districts, but it had been a failure due to it not been implemented properly, said Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa in a ministerial statement in Parliament yesterday.
However, he said measures have to be taken to issue warnings of bad weather immediately to the relevant areas along with visuals.
“The department had also taken steps to update the Tamil web site to some degree considering the limited resources available to the ministry. In order to provide round the clock translation services, at least four translators should be deployed. Due to repeated requests made to the National Languages Department to provide us Tamil translators, finally on December 20, 2017, they temporarily assigned one Tamil translator. However, he only provides translations only during five week days. Due to the lack of translators within the department, the National Languages Department had suggested that we obtain the services of the National Languages Translators’ Pool. Hence, the department is obtaining the assistance of translators from the translators’ pool in carrying out the required services within the department unhindered,” he said.
The Minister noted that bad weather warnings are sometimes needed to be issued during the nights and during weekends.
Therefore, he said in that in order to address this situation, translators are required to be deployed for this task and the State Administration Ministry has taken measures to fill these vacancies at their earliest.
Without renewal of agreement:
JO questions validity of Govt.’s continuation
The National Government's validity of continuation without the renewal of agreement between the UNP and the SLFP was questioned in Parliament yesterday by the Opposition MPs.
MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena, raising a question under Standing Orders 23 (2), stated that the Government had exceeded the number of Cabinet Ministers stipulated in the Constitution. “The National Government was formed subsequent to a Parliamentary motion in 2015. The UNP-SLFP MoU to work in a National Government expired on December 31. As per the Constitution, the number of Cabinet Ministers should be limited to only 30,” he said.
MP Gunawardena, observing that the Prime Minister should be consulted by the President prior to any ministerial appointment as per the Constitution, inquired from the Prime Minister whether he was consulted over the appointment of State Ministers Shriyani Wijewickrama and Piyasena Gamage last month.
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella, informing that the Prime Minister would reply to the question on a future date, queried MP Gunawardena whether he is against the appointment of MP Wijewickrama.
“No you keep her with you. She had done a somersault. That is irrelevant to what I asked. I am raising a serious question with regard to the violation of the Constitution,” MP Gunawardena replied.
“There is no legal problem. We are ready to accept any member who crosses over to this side,” Kiriella said.
Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Dissanayake said the number of Cabinet Ministers had been increased to 48, while the number of Deputy Ministers had been increased to 45 under the pretext of the National Government. Now its time had expired. We would like to know whether the Speaker had received the renewal agreement of the two parties. The Speaker should be duly informed if the agreement had been extended,” he noted.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya told the House that he had so far not received any official communication over a new agreement between the two parties or an extension of the existing agreement.
