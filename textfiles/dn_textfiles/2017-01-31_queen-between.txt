Queen in-between

Icons have always been prone to brickbats, at times much heavier than the bouquets. Venerable Dharmasena Thera, the official biographer of Sri Lanka’s medieval history, of course, cannot be an exception. The main accusation levelled against him is to be biased in chronicling the pre-Ceylonese history.
Mohan Raj Madawala not only accuses this much revered chronicler, but also challenges his version of history. His latest novel ‘Rejina’ (The Queen) turns the Mahawamsa account upside down.
Madawala is no stranger to Sri Lanka’s cultural scene. He has openly challenged the view that Sri Lanka does not have a proper book market. He claims to have his copies sold over 10,000, whereas an average established author can manage to sell a over 1000, and 2000. The figure is maximum 5000, followed by awards, media hype and other kinds of recognition.
Queen Anula is considered Sri Lanka’s first queen who reigned between 47 and 42 BC. She is more remembered as a woman for her lust than the first ever female head of state in the Asian region. Her first posting in the royalty was as consort of King Chora Naga, son of King Valagambahu. Mahawamsa narrates an account where Anula happens to poison four husbands in a row.
“What is laid down in Mahawamsa about Queen Anula is quite insufficient. That meagre account pictures her as a licentious woman. Even today when we hear the name of Anula, we picture a woman who had slept with many men. I had been wondering if that could really be true. So I spent a long time studying about Kings Kudatissa and Makalantissa who reigned before this lady,” Mohan Raj Madawala recalled the source of his interest.
Apparently the social order proves to have been exceedingly patriarchal. Anula’s rise to power could have been a pain for most males who were already privileged with a dominant role in governance. They would probably have disliked the idea of being governed by a woman.
When Venerable Mahanama Thera chronicled Mahawamsa, he had a purpose: to narrate a massive success story about the royal patronage offered to Buddhism. That said, he allocates 11 chapters to the rule of King Dutugemunu. Mohan Raj Madawala shares a conflict of interest with this Buddhist author, and observes worthier kings than Dutugemunu.
“I think the greatest king we ever had was King Mahasen. He was a decisive factor in our royal lineage. When you go to Uva and Wellassa areas, even today you will find people revering him as a god. Most people worship him as Minneri Devio. You can also see devalas dedicated to him. In one particular devala, you will find a sword too believed to have been used by King Mahasen,” Madawala noted.
How does Mahasen outsmart Dutugemunu?
Madawala sees him as a ruler who focused more on self-sufficient economy. Tanks, reservoirs and paddy fields come to the fore during Mahasen’s rule.
You cannot force a personality into a hero, Madawala notes. Heroes are born, not forced into a surreal existence. King Dutugemunu had been forced to be revered, whereas Mahasen has retained a special natural place in the people’s heart for generations. Paradoxically, Mahawamsa author pens only a few paragraphs in favour of King Mahasen.
That leads to an interesting conclusion.
“History is a part of fiction. No one can challenge what is written down about a period when none of us was alive. That triggers many questions of reliability. This unreliability provides us with a free licence.”
The licence to violate history? Even if you are to debate on grounds of a possible sacrilege, Mohan Raj Madawala is never to be stopped from executing what he wants. He identifies history as a part of fiction as well as an admixture of folklore and folktales.
“Take Gota’s War for instance. That book does not have a single reference about Sarath Fonseka. Forget about Fonseka’s political platform, but he was an instrumental figure in the fourth Eelam war mission. In 100 years, this book will be a historical source of the current period. The then readers will have a distorted idea of this period. But we cannot blame anyone for that. This type of activities can happen at any period in any land. We need to look at Mahawamsa in the same vein.”
Mohan Raj quotes Dan Brown of Da Vinci Code fame to elaborate that history is written according to the requirements of the winner in order to suppress the defeated. Any historical document is written according to the needs of the writer as well as the patron, most likely the incumbent rulers. Sometimes the written history could change according to the findings of the contemporary historians. History is a combination of facts as well as imagination.
“I was well positioned to write the account of Anula based on my imagination. I can easily challenge history, because that too is imagination. Queen Anula, in my imagination, is a lady who demands our respect. She was no prostitute. In a few years following her rule another lady ruler emerges as a Pharaoh Queen. Her name is Cleopatra. I try to link them in my work. “
A bulk of Mohan Raj’s books have been shortlisted for the mainstream awards, but never won any. He accredits it to the controversial nature of his books. It does not suit the traditional writing style followed by the traditional writers of this country.
“They mostly point out that I have a lot of sex scenes. Well, sex is a basic human requirement. I don’t see any fault in writing erotic scenes.”
Madawala’s previous novel, Lovina, though shortlisted, missed the award because of profaning scenes.
“I have a different writing style. It is not the reality style. It is the magical reality. Our life is too complicated. I resigned from media to dedicate myself to books. Right now the authors are doing it as a side business. But it should not happen that way. It should be professional. The authors come up with some book and all they can do is only approach a publisher. Finally they have to be happy with the 10 percent royalty. But I do not have faith in that system.
We should be like Dan Brown, Garcia Marques and Harry Potter author. They have a wide market. They can survive with the royalties because they have a wider readership, hence a good market. But with the limited readership in Sri Lanka, we cannot survive. We have to think of new marketing strategies.”
A book is a marketing commodity. It has to be marketed, Madawala believes. Rejina is the first book that was launched with a visual trailer.
“Most people do not agree with me on that. But remember, Paulo Coelho’s The Spy publicity campaign started six months before the actual launch. People knew it long before the launch. Our publishers are lazy. They are not interested in giving publicity. My copies sell over 20,000 because I take an extra effort in promoting it. True, the campaign demands money, but still it is fully worth. Because you are promoting a commodity. It needs to be professional,” Mohan Raj Madawala observed.
Queen Anula is no longer a licentious female head, as the Mahawamsa author narrates. Who is in the right path – is it Mahawamsa author or Mohan Raj Madawala –hardly matters now, because both works are now baptised as fiction.
Those who loathe Mohan Raj Madawala can continue to believe that Queen Anula was a shameless woman. If you are on the other side of the path, you can now begin to revere this great-grandmother. One thing is certain: Queen Anula is definitely an in-between.
Because facts are sacred in history, but anything can afford to happen in fiction.
