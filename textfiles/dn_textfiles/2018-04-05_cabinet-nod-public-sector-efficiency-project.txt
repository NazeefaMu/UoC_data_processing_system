Cabinet nod for Public Sector Efficiency Project

A Public Sector Efficiency Project (PSEP) which would identify and speed up under-performing public sector institutions and projects, received cabinet approval this week.
Cabinet also agreed to appoint Sanath J. Ediriweera as the project director.
The project, funded through a World Bank loan facility of USD 60 million, had been designed collectively by the government, World Bank and European Union (EU). The EU has agreed to provide a grant amounting to approximately USD 10 million for the project.
Mentioning that with approximately two more years to go for the government, Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said, “Sri Lanka has to critically evaluate its binding fiscal and public sector efficiency constraints and focus on institutional strengthening and public sector skills development, while ensuring transparency.”
As a result, the PSEP aims to support government policy changes, modernisation of its processes and systems, as well as building skills and capacity of the public sector. They had also identified the Fiscal Policy, National Planning, Project Management and Monitoring, Public Finance, National Budget, External Resources, State Accounts, Treasury Operations, Excise, Government Information, Valuation and Auditor General’s Departments as well as the Right to Information Commission, National Procurement Commission and the Controller General’s Office, as key public institutions which need direct financial support for technical and skills development.
In addition to capacity building, the Cabinet paper also noted that there was a “necessity of a more integrated and institutionalised vetting and monitoring function of major public investments of the country.”
To solve the issue, the ministry had proposed the establishment of a Public Investment Committee (PIC) to improve coordination between seven core government institutions.
The PIC would be chaired by the National Policies and Economic Affairs Ministry Secretary, with the Ministry’s Deputy Treasury Secretary and heads of above institutions. Meanwhile, the government also identified that its capital budget execution was inefficient and numerous local and foreign-funded strategic projects were under-performing.
Despite reports and increasing pressure, a certain number of current project teams do not seem to be in a position to deliver results within the foreseen time-frame and budget. These constraints would hinder the achievements of the macroeconomic targets anticipated by Vision 2025, they further said.
As a result, the National Policies and Economic Affairs Ministry had suggested to establish a Public Investment Delivery Task Force that could assist in identifying issues and potential issues and introduce strategies for under-performing projects. They are expected to give a much-needed push to the public sector reform process.
