Will Sri Lanka become a force in 7s?

Possibly a crash course in 7s fundamentals...and more insight into the sheer volume of legwork they clock up as prep to survive.
The heart and lung busting power is beyond words and perhaps the vital factor, whichever way we approach the form guide for 7s.
Fiji, New Zealand, South Africa, Australia, England, Kenya, USA and Samoa showing us the incredible skill and conditioning required surviving at this elite level...all World Series long.
Of course the burning question about Sri Lanka becoming a force ...will unfortunately remain just that ...a big IF.....given our current crop and record on the Asian circuit over the last 5 years.
We need to aim for full time professionals who travel to at least 6 tours annually.
The national squad given huge chunks of game time and quality understanding as a unit in the middle.
This is a decent start with lots to anticipate and evolve....
Naturally Priyantha CEO and director Rohan will be stretched beyond the union comfort zone.
I further believe you must harness as much experience as they can find ...to team up this radical path to regional domination.
As mentioned last week...Kenya and USA have trail-blazed scorching progress, defying logic, science and our imagination.
Their almost surreal transformation leaves islanders like us ....equator friendly and fresh transfusions of hope.
We need to create our warrior class.
If elite class and almost genius need a statement....the Cup finals...Australia v Fiji ...extra time, clock red ...Fiji scrum ...No panic ...just steely belief...islanders score, Australia weep...the world celebrated .what sorcery, what 7s.
Bula bula Fiji.
At home ...it’s that magnificent Bradby 2nd leg at the Pallekelle cauldron of fire....Trinity have much to do ...while Royal 30+ in the bag. need 70mins of showcase power to blitz the 74th edition back down to sea level oxygen at Reid Avenue HQ and history that elevates them all.
Crucially, it is all in Trinity’s hands and depending on Sheiks skill as captain and leader....the nature of this final will duck and dive to script.
I think we all need Trinity to shock confident Royal and really challenge them from kick-off to full time.
Aggression, heart and spirit to play hard ...relentless and skills so sharp...that will make the crowd gasp in admiration.
All roads will lead to Kandy this Saturday...travel early and park sensible...as exit plans are patience and calm...then the way out in order.
The Singer school season is relentless and unforgiving so far ....with a ton more anticipated.
Can Joes step up.....Will Patana force their way back? Have Martis and Peteris got the X factor and more to outplay Royal?
It boils down to manageable injuries, especially to key players and bench strength.
Teams with the luxury of form and balance will be licking their lips in huge anticipation...as will their faithful following...knowing the quality of finishing.
As islanders and traditions go ...it is all down to our young gladiators to step boldly and play hard but fair at all times.
Respect and decency must prevail.
Bula bula our rugby hearts that believe.
Cheers Sri api!
