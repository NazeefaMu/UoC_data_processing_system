On the road to Jaffna

I was fortunate to visit Jaffna for a few days with the pleasant company of Jay Perera, an Aerospace Engineer from Melbourne. He is the son of a good friend of mine who also lives in Melbourne.
Early Morning we left Colombo on the a/c train, and reached Jaffna in six hours. I must confess that this particular train was pure luxury to me in comparison to the clap trap trains our office workers and school children have to contend with day in day out. This feeling of having been inside a plane was short lived because as the train started to jingle jangle away, my body which was calm and my mind composed was jittery but I mastered my mind saying to myself that the railway way lines around Maradana and Fort resembled a plate of spaghetti hence the wheels had to deal with not a smooth flow of straight lines but criss-crossing through the slight gaps and the curves which were a far cry from the ones you get in the female of the species.
Warakapola onwards the greenery of our lush surroundings was in evidence. Thank God this was before the heavens opened with all its fury and the devastation it caused was a direct body blow to all and sundry. They say the Weather Gods are not kind. I wonder why they are called Gods in the first place!
Maho to Anuradhapura and beyond, scrub land was evident and few inhabitants were seen in the surroundings with mud huts and thatched roofs dotted here and there. This I thought was real third world, this in comparison to the Colombo crowd with their Pajerros and cute town houses or what have you? Are we living in a balanced world? Not by a country mile. Even from a distance the hard ships they had to undergo to eke out a living was stamped in their innocent faces, in comparison to the boorish arrogance of the new rich lot in Colombo, it was a breath of fresh air. My toothache is why should these innocent people ‘cow down’ to the ‘dark brown Shahibs’ some of whom even try to bargain with them to save a few measly rupees, this I put down to lack of basic education which leads to bring out the animal instinct in the man, which at times leads to going beyond the boundaries which can have devastating effects on young lives.
Coming back to sanity, the ride has become incredibly smooth, due to the relaying of the railway lines, after the havoc created by the war. I felt as if we were in a foreign country, by now we have passed Vavunia. The train was going hell for leather past Omanthai, Mankulam, Kilinochchi, Elephant Pass, Chava and then to Jaffna, which was a dainty little station in comparison to The humongous ones in Maradana and Fort. We managed to fend our way by foot to our guest house.
Prior arrangements for the guest house and the tour guide were already pre-arranged by Jay, which was convenient. After grabbing a quick lunch, our tour guide Mohan was there to pick us up at 2 pm.
We visited the Jaffna Town as per the schedule of Mohan, the tour guide. According to the tour guide, after the independence from Britain in 1948, Jaffna town was ranked as the second largest town next to Colombo. Due to the three decades old civil war, the town was torn apart and now in the process of emerging as phoenix. The total destruction of the Jaffna GA’S office, we saw with our very own eyes. Jaffna is the cultural capital of Tamils in Sri Lanka and the unique features are needed to be witnessed.
Dutch fort
Even though it’s called as the Dutch fort, it has more than, 2,000 years old history as archeologists recently have unearthed 2,000 years old Chinese clay pots and 1,500 years old Romanian coins in order to prove the ancient history. Despite the fact that this 22 acres fort was badly affected by bombing, for a certain extent it has been renovated.
Famous Library
It’s a pity this world famous library was burnt in the early eighties with more than 97,000 books and manuscripts but in spite of all the draw backs still tries to provide the esteemed services once again to the needy in the region after it had been reconstructed.
Fishing hubs
Jaffna’s sea food is very delicious as 99 percent of the catch is pure natural. Mouthwatering crabs, scrumptious prawns, and luscious cuttlefish, delectable lobsters etc are exported to many western countries due to the renowned trade mark. The splendid Christian tradition and local cultural touch can be witnessed in the construction of the Catholic and other branches of churches which can be seen in the close vicinity.
Old park
Once used by the British in the past for several administrative purpose and recreation needs now serving as one of the relaxing area for the Jaffna populace.
Nallur Temple
It’s almost impossible to explain the art and culture of Jaffna without mentioning the sculpture and beauty of Nallur temple that has more than 500 years history. The most spectacular cultural and religious place in Jaffna is Nallur temple and this is a must visit destination for a traveler in north and still attractsthousands of locals daily.
15th century relics
The last Tamil ruler, King Sankilian can’t be forgotten by the locals for his adventurous battle against Portuguese, and the latter finally became the first western colonial master in north. Still we could see the relics of buildings which had been built by King Sankilian and maintained by the successive rulers of Jaffna.
Museum
A small museum in the heart of Jaffna encloses sufficient relics, used utensils, manuscripts, unearthed archeological pieces etc, to illustrate the rich culture of Jaffna in spite of limited modern resources.
Keermalai Well
This well is mostly visited by Hindus who believe in its healing powers. It is a nice oblong shaped ancient construction, well maintained with very clear water. Strangely enough although it is situated just near the sea, the sea water is salty and the well water is not salty or hot. It comes from an underneath well, that seems to connect this Keerimalai Hot Springs with the Nilavarai bottomless well that is situated 10 km. away from this one.
Buddhist monuments
According to our tour guide, there were many Buddhist priests who committed suicide at once, and these monuments were built by an entrepreneur in that era in honor of them.
Direction arrows
The above direction board, shows the distance from the sea to several countries including Australia, etc.
Before I rap up this article up, I would like to pen a few words about the Jaffna people I came across during my brief stay there. They were extremely polite and each time when we asked for directions, they went out of their way to direct us to where we wanted to go. I saw no animosity towards the Sinhala people which was heartening indeed. It really is a pity that most of their counterparts in Colombo laugh at you when you show politeness to them. This frog in the well attitude of our people should be changed and sooner the better. We are all patriots and would like to see our rich culture to be reflected on the faces of people in Colombo, people up above will surely look into it, step by step.
