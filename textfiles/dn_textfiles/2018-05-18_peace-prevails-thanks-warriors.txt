Peace prevails thanks to warriors

The last bullet was fired on May 19, 2009 and this is the 9th year since the war ended. Commander of the Army Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake requested his soldiers that the whole country has a lot of aspirations on the Army, Navy and the Air Force.
“It is our responsibility to ensure that we live and maintain that standard and give confidence to all Sri Lankans that we are your guardians. Secondly, I pray that peace will prevail and if it is a fragile peace, we should do everything in our power, forgetting all differences, politically and work towards a common objective to ensure that this country fast track to reach the lost 30 years, and to ensure that the next generation should not suffer the way we had to. That is the commitment all soldiers should bear in mind. I pray that all disabled soldiers a speedy recovery and we are a victorious army and we should maintain that victory,” he said, adding that the role of the army has been changed from a combat army to a capacity based army. The army is now undergoing a process of rightsizing. National security cannot be compromised at any cost, the Commander said.
“During the 9 years after the war, we as the armed forces is looking at different ways on how we should celebrate our victory. The army is a glamorous force, but it is not to be exhibited outside. We are very happy with the representations on February 4th which is the accepted day of national Independence. May 19th came about primarily because of the war and that particular operation. As for the Army there are two important calendar days, one being the day of Independence and the other is the Army day on October 10. Our pomp and pageantry can be exhibited if required on these two days and not otherwise,” he said.
The ruthless war that plagued the country for three decades led to the loss of thousands of lives both military and civilian. In the Army 877 officers and 19,597 other rankers have sacrificed their lives to liberate the country from terrorism. A further 125 officers are still reported missing in action while 3,363 other rankers are also reported missing during the war. The war has also rendered 1,298 officers disabled while another 36,659 other rankers were also rendered disabled.
Among them around 11 officers and around 275 other rankers who are currently housed at five state run institutions to ensure they are cared for throughout their life. These institutions are Abhimansala in Anuradhapura, Kamburupitiya and Pangolls, Mihindu Seth Medura in Attidiya and Ranaviru Sevana in Ragama.
However, while these valiant soldiers have sacrificed their life and limb to liberate the country, their sacrifice has been ignored and the day has been transformed into a gallant ceremony, which has attracted much criticism. In an interview with the Daily News, the Army Commander Lt. Gen. Mahesh Senanayake said he is not blaming the government for taking the decision to hold these pageants, but added that these parades were a source of great inconvenience for the very soldiers. “There are many who like to come and watch these parades, but it is the very soldier who has to put in a great deal of effort to make these parades a success. Hence, this is not the time to blow our own trumpet and boast to the world that we are victorious. What we want is to remember our brothers who sacrificed their lives for this combat and those who have been made disabled during the war and all Sri Lankans who suffered.”
He noted that this year they are not under pressure or no agenda has been given to them with regard to holding a victory day ceremony. Instead he said a series of programmes have been organised at every military establishment throughout the country. “I have already issued a message as the Commander appreciating all what our officers, soldiers and predecessors have done to bring about peace. I have also told them what we are supposed to do now to maintain this peace.”
When asked about memorial ceremonies that are being organised in the North to commemorate the fallen LTTE members, the Commander said, “The Tamils have their own sentiments. If they light a lamp in memory of a relative who had died during the war, it should not matter. We have our own programmes to commemorate this day at all religious institutions. Hence, there is nothing wrong in the people in the North commemorating their loved ones who have died during the war. Moreover, it costs millions of rupees to hold such pageants. With the rise in fuel prices and the rising cost of living, how can we, being the armed forces who are paid by the public, have such functions with public funds? We feel that this is not the right way. Instead we would rather conduct religious activities that would bring merit to the souls of these war heroes,” he said.
When asked about allegations that the war heroes are being discarded and them being deprived of even their rightful pensions, the Commander said, “The war heroes who are dependent, will be taken care of by the military for the rest of their life. With regard to their pensions, the governments have already addressed these issues. But there are policies, governing rules and regulations in terms of finances. There are procedural delays and blocks at several points. Even once the Cabinet approves, there is a process. All those who left the army after injury or disablement have been given their demands even without completion of 12 years of service. But when there is a delay some make a big issue. Others take political advantage and push these soldiers onto the streets to protest. There may be some who are facing disciplinary issues which will have to be sorted out first. The Defence Ministry has done a comprehensive study and taken positive steps to resolve these issues. Many other countries do not pay these disables soldiers like we do,” he said, adding that some had opted to leave the army knowing what they were forfeiting and come back after some time claiming for their rights. “They are not babies, they knew what they were committing to when they opted to leave,” he added.
He noted that a war is an extension of politics. “As the country’s military we had to fight but now it is over. We know what the threats to the country are. Now that the war is over we have a two pronged approach for the future of the army for 2020 and 2025 and beyond. In that the role of the army is clearly identified. The strength of the military to achieve these goals has also been identified. That is called rightsizing. All these years we were a threat based army, but now we are looking at a capacity based army where we should have the capacity to face any eventuality. This is the sustainment and modernisation plans for the army,” noted Lt. Gen. Senanayake.
He noted it is a concern for him that there are over 300 missing from the army. He said in Batticaloa Police in a day over 600 went missing, in Mulaithivu 200 missing in one night. “But no one is talking about these, but we are cooperating with the Office of the Missing Persons. We are very happy to have the four pillars of transitional justice. With regard to the local mechanism, we must understand that this country’s judicial system has a history of thousands of years. Hence we don’t need to get judges from another country. But its a matter of someone getting these parties together and building the confidence of the people. We are in fact educating the people of the North and East to make use of the OMP.”
