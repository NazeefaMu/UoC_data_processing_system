Jinasena unveils  innovative water pumps

Jinasena (Pvt) Limited, a leading water management system solutions providers in Sri Lanka, has launched two water pumps in keeping with the company’s approach of leading from the front by providing innovation and continuously improving its product range.
The first of the two water pumps is the NR 120/1, a new 1-inch 1HP domestic pump that the company’s tests have demonstrated can outper form any similar-sized water pump in the market today. This traditional cast iron pump consists of a Noryll impeller and is ideally-suited for high head application domestic customers with its 80ft total head and 25-30ft of suction depth, which can be increased further with the use of a Deep Well Kit. The pump is compact in size, produces less noise and can withstand voltage fluctuations.
The second launched water pump is the latest addition to Sri Lanka’s first and only range of Polymer water pumps specifically manufactured for parts of the country that have hard water such as the coastal regions and the North Western, North Central and Northern Provinces.
Polymer is a 100% recyclable material that is light-weight, durable and safe. All water samples from the Polymer water pumps have been extensively tested at the ITI (Industrial Technology Institute) to ensure that they are free of contaminants. The entire pump is made of Polymer and is therefore non-corrosive.
Elaborating on the additions to the product range, Prabath Jayawardana Deputy General Manager (Research and Development and Quality Control) of Jinasena (Pvt) Limited said, “Jinasena’s R&D team continuously performs testing and evaluation of our products as well as competitor products to assess where our products stand in the market.”
Both the water pumps are available through Jinasena’s network of 19 Service Centres located at Colombo, Bandarawela, Buttala, Girandurukotte, Beruwala, Ekala, Avissawella, Dambulla, Kandy, Nuwara Eliya, Galle, Kaduruwela, Tambuttegama, Anuradhapura, Kurunegala, Trincomalee, Ampara, Embilipitiya and Jaffna. Both products come with a 7-year warranty, highly-reliable after sales service and ample spare parts.
Founded in 1905, Jinasena (Pvt) Limited was the first Ceylonese-owned engineering company and was rated among the five leading engineering companies in the island by 1932.
