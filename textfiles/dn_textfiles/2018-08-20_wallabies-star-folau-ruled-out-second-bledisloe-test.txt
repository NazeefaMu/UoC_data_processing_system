Wallabies star Folau ruled out of second Bledisloe Test

SYDNEY: Wallabies star Israel Folau was Sunday ruled out of the second Bledisloe Cup Test with an ankle injury, in a further blow to Australia after their big loss to New Zealand.
Fullback Folau limped off in the 65th minute in the first Test in Sydney on Saturday, as the All Blacks thumped the Wallabies 38-13 in a clash that doubled as the Rugby Championship opener.
Wallabies coach Michael Cheika said the 29-year-old had a “small tear in a muscle right down low” but added that it was “just a lot of swelling” and not a long-term injury.
“We’re hopeful he’ll be back for the game in Brisbane against the Springboks,” Cheika said.
“I think it’s logical to bring in a winger like Naivalu as we have (Jack) Maddocks who can play winger and fullback as well as (Tom) Banks who is an out-and-out fullback.” Brumbies pair Folau Faingaa and Rory Arnold, and Rebels centre Billy Meakes will also travel to Auckland to help with the Wallabies’ preparations.
The All Blacks have also been hit by injuries ahead of next week’s clash at Eden Park in Auckland, with Ryan Crotty and Rieko Ioane both sidelined.
The Wallabies have not won at Eden Park since 1986. They are due to face South Africa in Brisbane on September 8. AFP
