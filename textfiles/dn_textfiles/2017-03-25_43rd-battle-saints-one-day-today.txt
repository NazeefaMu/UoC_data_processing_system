43rd Battle of the Saints one-day today

The Josephian-Peterite limited overs match which is the longest running encounter in the country and played for the Fr. Peter A. Pillai trophy will be worked off at the SSC grounds today.
The Joe-Pete limited over commenced in 1975 under the Rectorship of Rev. Fr. Quintus Fernando of St. Joseph’s and Rev. Fr. Claver Perera of St. Peter’s, with the first game of the series played at Darley Road on March 16, 1975.
Interestingly the match returns to the SSC after 1994 and a large crowd is expected to witness an enthralling game of cricket.
In the last years 50-over encounter, Peterite batsman Hashan Wanasekera played a match-winning knock of 118 that set a record stand of 152 runs for any wicket for the Bambalapitiya school erasing the previous best partnership of 143 runs between Angelo Perera and Chathura Peiris in 2009. Incidentally his partner was this year’s Peterite captain Lakshina Rodrigo who made 61.
The lowest total in the shortest format is also recorded by St. Peter's when they were bowled out for 58 in 2003, which incidentally is the highest winning margin.
St. Peter’s go into this encounter brimming with confidence as they are the defending champions.
Peters head coach is former captain Malinda Warnapura.
Meanwhile left-arm spinner Harin Cooray will lead St.Joseph’s with veteran national player Roger Wijesuriya as their head coach.
The tally stands at St. Joseph 21 wins to St. Peter’s 19 with one ending in a tie and one wash out.
