ICAO to celebrate 104th anniversary on December 7

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) celebrated its 104-year long service yesterday. Their first flight had taken its inaugural journey on December 7, 1912.
The International Civil Aviation Day is significant for Sri Lankans as it is an important milestone in the local civil aviation sector, Civil Aviation Director General H.M.C. Nimalsiri said.
The day helps generate and reinforce worldwide awareness of the importance of international civil aviation in developing states' social and economic spheres. The ICAO helps states cooperate and realise a truly global rapid transit network at the service of all mankind, he added. The UN and world nations have now adopted Agenda 2030 and embarked on a new era in global sustainable development. Therefore, the importance of aviation as an engine of global connectivity is never been more relevant to the Chicago Convention's objectives to look for international flight as a fundamental enabler of global peace and prosperity, he said.
Coinciding with the ICAO every five-year anniversary, the organization celebrates the way in accordance with a special theme.
The Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention) was signed on December 7, 1944 by 52 states. Pending ratification of the Convention by 26 states, the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization (PICAO) was established. It had been functioning from 6 June 6, 1945 to 4 April 1947. By March 5, 1947, the 26th ratification was carried out.
The ICAO was established on April 4, 1947. In October of the same year, the ICAO became one of the UN specialised agencies linked to the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).
A slight decrease in global aviation accidents was reported this year compared to the previous year. Seventy six aviation accidents were reported in this year and 3.6 billion passengers were transported worldwide. However, only five fatal accidents were reported. The number of accidents reported last year was 85, Nimalsiri said.
