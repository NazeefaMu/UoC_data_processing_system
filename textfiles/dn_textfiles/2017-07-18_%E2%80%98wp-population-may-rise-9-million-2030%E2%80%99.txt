‘WP population may rise to 9 million by 2030’

 The population in the Western Province is five million and it is likely to increase by another four million by 2030, Finance and Mass Media Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna said.
He was speaking at the urban planning workshop organised by the Sri Lankan Association for International Understanding and S. D. Bandaranayake Foundation to implement Hambantota International Cultural Exchange Centre with technical and financial assistance from expert teams in China, Germany and Finland.
The Deputy Minister said that over 1.1 million vehicles travel to Colombo city limits daily and the average speed in the Colombo city was identified as 10 kmph. It will be further decreased to five kmph by 2020 if no sustainable solution will be implemented to overcome the adverse issues due to urbanisation, he added. Alagiyawanna also said that development projects would be carried out by the Government, along with the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry, to reduce and eliminate the negative externalities caused by traffic congestion, garbage disposal, environmental pollution and other related negative effects due to urbanization.
“Feasibility study for the 65 km long light rail system to be established within Colombo city limits is in progression.
A 6,000 acre industrial township in Mirigama and a science and technology city in Homagama will be developed under the guidance of the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry. A coastal conservation project will also be implemented to conserve the coastal areas from Negombo to Moratuwa,” the Deputy Minister added.
He pointed out that measures had been taken to implement a waste-to-energy project in Muthurajawela to overcome the prevailing garbage crisis. The Deputy Minister further said over 60,000 shanties had been identified within an area of 600 acres in Colombo and the Government had implemented a project to construct permanent shelters for those who live in shanties.
Five thousand houses are already constructed and 15,000 houses are in progression, Alagiyawanne added.
He also said that Hambantota International Cultural Exchange Centre project would create a favourable platform for other nations to contribute for the sustainable development of Sri Lanka.
Chairman of Sri Lanka Association of International Understanding and S. D. Bandaranayake Foundation Subash Bandaranayake said that Hambatota International Cultural Exchange Centre project would cater for the long-term sustainable needs of the country.
Ceylon German Technical Training Institute Chairman Pandu Bandaranayake, Hambantota International Cultural Exchange Project Chinese Delegate Sun Huwa, Sri Lanka Association of International Understanding and S. D. Bandaranayake Foundation Secretary Justin Abeysinghe and professional expert teams from China, Germany and Finland, also participated.
