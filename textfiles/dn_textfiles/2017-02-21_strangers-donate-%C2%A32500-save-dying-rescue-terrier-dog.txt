Strangers donate £2,500 to save a dying rescue terrier dog

Caring strangers have given a dying rescue dog her life back after donating £2,500 in just hours for her to be fitted with a pacemaker.
Molly, a five-year-old terrier cross, was diagnosed with a third-degree cardiac block that caused her heart to beat too slowly – a condition that was gradually killing her.
News of her plight clearly touched people’s hearts because when the RSPCA appealed this month for donations for a life-saving operation, the cash was raised in only three hours.
Molly was fitted with the device in a two-hour operation by Chris Linney, head of cardiology at Willows Veterinary Centre in Solihull, and is recovering at the RSPCA kennels in Coventry.
Mr Linney said: ‘Molly’s story has really captured people’s imagination. It’s a fairly uncommon procedure to fit a dog with a pacemaker.
‘The operation was challenging due to her small size, but Molly is recovering really well.
‘The whole team has fallen in love with her. She is a fantastic dog.’
Molly, who has featured on Channel 5’s The Dog Rescuers, was taken in by the RSPCA in May last year after her former owner failed to care for her properly. She has already spent several months overcoming a severe skin condition.
Danni Holder, from the RSPCA, said: ‘The operation means Molly now has a new lease of life. We think she will get rehomed really quickly, which will be the icing on the cake for her.’ Daily Mail
