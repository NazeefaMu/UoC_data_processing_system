Madushanka doubtful  for Nidahas tri-series

Sri Lanka fast bowler Shehan Madushanka who suffered a hamstring injury during the 2nd T20 match against Bangladesh in Sylhet is doubtful for the upcoming Hero Nidahas tri-series in Colombo. A Sri Lanka Cricket media release states, the extent of Madushanka’s injury will only be ascertained following a MRI scan, which Madushanka is expected to undergo today.
“At this stage, his availability for the Hero Nidahas Trophy is in doubt,” states the communiqué.
