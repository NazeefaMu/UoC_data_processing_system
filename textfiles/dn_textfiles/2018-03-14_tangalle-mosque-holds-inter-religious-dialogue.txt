Tangalle Mosque holds inter-religious dialogue

A meeting was recently held at the Tangalle Jumma Mosque, to ease the recent racial tension and reconcile residents of the area.
The reasons that led to the clash in Kandy was also discussed at length, at the meeting. Participants said such terrorist acts should never happen in the Hambantota district. They said that this issue should be resolved through communal discussions.
Buddhist monks, Catholic priests and moulavis of the area were also present.
