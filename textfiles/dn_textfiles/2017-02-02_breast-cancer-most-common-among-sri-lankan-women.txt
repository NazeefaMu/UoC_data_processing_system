Breast cancer, most common among Sri Lankan women

According to the National Cancer Registry 2010, the overall crude incidence rate of cancer in Sri Lanka was 82.1 and the age standardised incidence rate was 87.5 per 100,000 population. Breast cancer is the most common accounting for 26.8 percent of all cancers among females, Health Services Acting Director General Dr. Jayasundara Bandara said.
He was addressing a press conference at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo yesterday to mark the World Cancer Day, which falls on February 4.
He said the second leading cancer type in Sri Lanka in 2010 emerges in lip, oral cavity, and pharynx with an age standardized incidence of 12.7 per 100,000. It is the commonest cancer among males which accounts for 24 percent of the total number of male cancers.
Breast, uterine, cervix, thyroid gland, oesophagus, and ovary cancers are five leading types among females. Among males, lip, oral cavity and pharynx, trachea, bronchus and lungs, oesophagus, colon, and rectum and lymphoma lead the other types, he said.
Everyday, around seven new breast cancer incidences and two cervical cancers are reported in Sri Lanka. Leading a overall healthy life is what helps prevent from having cancers, he said.
