Wasps attack funeral procession in Galaha

When a corpse was being carried to the Pupurassa cemetery in Galaha, a swarm of wasps attacked the coffin-bearers compelling them to leave the corpse aside and run.
A 10-year-old boy who ran fearing the wasps had fallen into the newly dig grave. Severely injured, he had been admitted to hospital. Altogether 12 persons had been hospitalised attacked by the wasps. The firecrackers that relatives of the dead used along the road to the graveyard could have threatened the wasps to attack the funeral procession, villagers said.
