‘Grateful for removal’

“I am grateful to President Maithripala Sirisena for removing me from the post of media spokesman of the SLFP. I admit that I am not suitable for holding that post now. While holding that post, I criticised former President Chandrika Bandaranaike and several other seniors of the SLFP. Disciplinary measures were taken against me, said SLFP Dilan Perera was contacted by the Daily News from Kurunegala.
President Maithripla Sirisena, being the head of the SLFP should take the same disciplinary measures on the present SLFP senior members who openly insult and criticise the present senior Advisor of the SLFP Mahinda Rajapaksa, the former President and the Head of the SLFP. I was appointed to the media spokesman post by the Central Committee of the SLFP and I would propose to the Central Committee of the SLFP to second that proposal to remove me soon. I am going to send an e-mail to the President thanking him for his decision to remove me.”
