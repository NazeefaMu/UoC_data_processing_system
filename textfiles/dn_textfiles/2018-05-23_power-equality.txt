Power of equality

Head Girl of St. Lawrence Convent Sheneli Peiris has a pioneering spirit. She is also highly adventurous. Perfect Prefects features Peiris who is destined for great feats.
With advancements in technology, this era demands that the youth be futuristic. We live in an era where technology enables us to achieve dreams and goals that may have seemed impossible in the past. Peiris is ambitious and has the facilities to make her dreams come true.
“My life ambition is to be an astronaut or an author. I love reading and I come from a religious family. There are so many things hidden in the Universe. I want to discover them. I feel I can achieve my dream of travelling into outer space and becoming the first Sri Lankan to do so. Even if you take human nature, there is so much hidden. I want to be a pioneer unravelling the mysteries of life,” said Peiris.
Human nature
Peiris, however, has another option if her ambition of being an astronaut does not work out. She is very interested in books namely those written by Enid Blyton.
“If my ambition of being an astronaut does not work out, I would like to be an author of books concerning human nature. I want to discover new things, and influence people to do the correct thing and follow the correct path by my writing. One day I can become a role model to others. I want to write for teenagers and maybe one day become the Enid Blyton of Sri Lanka. Enid Blyton wrote about 1500 words per day. I love the books she wrote – Secret Seven, Famous Five and Malory Towers. All the books are about school children and their adventures,” pointed out Peiris.
Peiris has been at St. Lawrence Convent since Montessori and says that her school has had a significant influence on her life.
“I want to thank my teachers and fellow students who are like sisters to me. They are like my second family. I feel no difference between my family at home and my family at school. We all support and motivate each other. Our school is all about relationships and no one can separate and divide us,” said Peiris.
Peiris pointed out, that her school looks at her as someone who admirably shoulders her responsibilities.
“I was the Deputy Games Captain in the primary school, and in Grade 10 I was Secretary of the Sinhala Literary Association. I was the Junior Western Band Leader and last year I was the Senior Western Band Leader. I feel now I am under close scrutiny being the head girl,” said Peiris.
Equal treatment
For Peiris, it has been a long journey. She knows almost everyone in her school which has helped her build relationships.
“I feel that one problem in society is that people are not treated equally. I believe in equality. And when I say that, I mean that they should be treated equally regardless of their skin colour or ethnicity. Maybe as a writer, I could promote equality. War creates such suffering. Children get affected the most. In my schools, there are so many children from different backgrounds. But we are one family. We learn together and we are in the same classes. If we are united, why can’t the rest of the world be united? Living together is the most important thing in the world,” explained Peiris.
For her O/Ls, she got 8 A’s and 1B for science. So she chose to do Commerce for her A/Ls. She also says that her parents have given her the freedom to do whatever she wants to do. Perhaps for her second shy, she can pursue Science if she wants to.
“Next year I will be completing my music exams and take my degree. Maybe as a part-time job, I can be a musician or I can focus on writing books. If I do my A/Ls well, maybe I can be an accountant. There are so many different paths I can choose. It is my life,” stated Peiris.
Bronze medal
Peiris started music when she was in Grade 2. She can play several musical instruments including the piano.
“In the primary and junior bands, she played the Melodica. I was the band leader in the Junior Band last year. I joined the Senior Band in 2012. I was the first student to bring a medal to the school by playing the Piano. I received a bronze medal from ‘Festival of Performing Arts’. After that, I got silver and gold. I can play the saxophone and trumpet. When it comes to Piano Exams, now I am doing Grade 7 and next year I will do Grade 8. Then the stages are completed,” added Peiris.

Peiris’ message to anyone is not to give up. She says if you fail once you should try again. If you fail twice you should try harder.
When it comes to events in history what is most memorable to her is 2009, when we won the Civil War. Her father is a retired army officer.
“When I see my father’s fellow officers from the army without legs, hands and so many injuries I can understand the gravity of it all and the terrible price they have paid. I have seen tears in their eyes. When you see such things, you hope that something like that will never happen again,” explained Peiris.
Human telepathy
What the youth can achieve today was unimaginable in the past. The possibilities are endless in this day and age if you have the willpower and talent. Peiris says that new discoveries from NASA interest her.
“When we were in the Stone Age, they never envisioned cell phones or computers. It is quite possible that voyages in space will become a reality. Telepathy between humans could be the norm making these voyages a reality,” said Peiris.
Peiris also pointed out her school is a leading Catholic Girls School in the heart of Colombo and that the Principal helps the girls in everything they do and is the reason that they have achieved great heights in guiding and basketball. Guiding was started in 1954 and the school have produced many President Guides. Also in Basketball, they have become champions on many occasions during the past few years. This year itself they came fourth place in Nationals and Champions at the Zonal Level. Peiris is supported by her Deputy Head Prefect Rachel De Silva.
