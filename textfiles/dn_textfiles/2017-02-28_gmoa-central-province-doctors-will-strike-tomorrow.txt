GMOA Central Province doctors will strike tomorrow

Doctors attached to state hospitals in the Central Province will launch a strike tomorrow from 8.00 am to 12.00 noon in protest of the 'private medical faculty' at SAITM, Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoysa said in a statement.
Dr. Zoysa said it is possible the strike would extend to other districts, if the other doctors attached to the GMOA decide to join the strike. This is the fifth in a series of strikes launched by the GMOA in all nine provinces.
The GMOA Secretary pointed out that several protests in the forms of rallies, conferences, hand outs will take place on the same day with the participation of all anti SAITM movements. So far no step has been taken by relevant authorities to solve the SAITM issue and prevent people from undergoing various difficulties, he said. 
Dr. Zoysa also said the GMOA was going on strike in order to safeguard patients lives - and not for the benefit of doctors. He said all emergency care, maternity care, pediatric care, kidney treatment, cancer care will not be affected by any of the planned trade union actions.
