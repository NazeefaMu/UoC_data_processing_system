To stop country’s cricket from plunging further:
Former cricket administrators urge Sports Minister to appoint interim committee

Former Sri Lanka Cricket presidents and administrators have written a strong letter to Sports Minister Faiszer Mustapha urging him to appoint an interim committee to resurrect the country’s cricket from plunging further into the mire it has fallen into.
The letter signed by the first interim committee chairman Rienzie Wijetilleke and past presidents of SLC Ana Punchihewa, Hemaka Amarasuriya, Sidath Wettimuny, Vijay Malalasekera, Jayantha Dharmadasa, Upali Dharmadasa and Arjuna Ranatunga have pointed out the misdeeds, waste and corruption that has taken place from the time the Thilanga Sumathipala administration was elected to office in January 2016 that has resulted in the national cricket team’s fall from grace in the rankings in all three formats..
They urge the Minister to appoint an interim committee to look into all the misdeeds and to streamline the election process with necessary amendments to the constitution of Sri Lanka Cricket to prevent the rampant abuse of power as practiced by the incumbent administration, leaving no room for such brazen acts to be repeated in the future.
The SLC administration is currently under the Sports Minister appointed Competent Authority following the postponement of elections due to a legal injunction which is pending.
