Service industry leads China's  GDP growth

Chinese companies in the service sector saw stronger profit growth in the first three quarters thanks to rising demand for services and steady price rises, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Tuesday.
The companies saw their operating profit rise 31.4 percent year-on-year in the first three quarters, which was 8.6 percentage points higher than in the first eight months, according to the bureau.
The profit growth of the service sector was faster than that in the industrial sector, which saw 22.8 percent growth year-on-year.
Bureau spokeswoman Liu Aihua said the service sector was a “bright spot” for the Chinese economy when all other major economic indicators pointed to a slight contraction in October.
The rapid rise in demand for services has led to a steady price rise, which contributed to the “outstanding” performance of corporate profitability in the service sector, Liu said at a news conference in Beijing.
The service sector's proportion of China's GDP has been rising steadily, surpassing 50 percent in 2015, indicating an improved economic structure.
