Squishy and Rosy’s daily adventures

If you’ve ever wanted a pet turtle, scrolling through the Instagram of Squishy And Rosy-a pair of red-eared slider turtles-might just heighten that desire. Although they’re not fluffy, they’re certainly as cute as the other furry animals that are fawned after online. This is evident in the photos captured by their human Brittney, who shares daily snapshots of the New York-based pet turtles in all sorts of adorable scenarios.
From skateboarding to motorbiking, there seems to be no end to the adventures of Squishy and Rosy. The adorable duo are seen sporting all sorts of turtle-sized attire, including tiny hats, scarves, and umbrellas. In one image, a very sophisticated Squishy is seen wearing a beret and painting “en plein air.”
He’s comically quoted as saying, “‘Didn’t think I would finish the painting today. Neither did I plan on looking this sexy’.—Squishyangelo.” In another image, Rosy is spotted taking an afternoon dip in the pool, floating on a mini inflatable unicorn.
“Squishy and Rosy have always been very photogenic since they were the size of a single quarter. I just knew that there was something special about them.” says Brittney.
“I originally started taking pictures of the turtles because it made me smile but turns out my photos and videos have brought joy into other people’s lives. And that’s why I do what I do today.”
Sadly, Rosy passed away in February, 2018. However, there’s no doubt that she lived a wonderful, happy life! You can see more from these turtle’s daily adventures on Instagram.
