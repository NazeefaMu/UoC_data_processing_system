On a  common  cause...

Today’s Youth are highly knowledgeable and healthily skeptical. They are armed with talents and knowledge in diverse fields. They are also ambitious and eager to make a difference everyday in all fields of work and as leaders in the community.
Young people constitute one quarter of the world’s population, and one third of the population in developing nations.They have been in the forefront of drives for equality and justice through youth social movements throughout the world. They have led movements against political action and anti-corruption in the recent past. There is also an increased recognition in the decision making process lead by the youth and continuous effort has been made to bring young people to the table in development planning.
The Commonwealth Youth Forum, which runs parallel to the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM), is one such platform which has been set for youth to build cross-cultural connections and networks to recognize challenges, create youth led initiatives and influence decision makers in ensuring that youth have a say in the future. Aptly themed as “Powering Our Common Future” the 2018 Youth Forum saw many youth with potentials coming together in London, UK. Sri Lanka’s youth representative Sachinda Dulanjana Witharana is a youth of many talents.

His presence was not only noted but he also made an impact as his nomination was accepted for the Commonwealth Youth Council Elections 2018 which was held during 11th Commonwealth Youth Forum.
“I was one of the three Sri Lankans who were running for different positions of Commonwealth Youth Council this year. I ran for the position of Asia Regional Representative for Commonwealth Youth Council. My election campaign slogan was ‘#MissionContinues’,” Sachinda said.
Around 53 Commonwealth Member States vote for the candidates through their national delegates. Though he did not win the position being a candidate for the event itself was a great achievement for Sri Lanka.
“It was a very stiff competition but the experience was worth it. I will continue my mission to serve young people across the Commonwealth and beyond with my experience,” he said.

Recalling his roots Sachinda says, “The beginning of my Commonwealth journey dates back to the 9th Commonwealth Youth Forum 2013 which was held parallel to CHOGM 2013 in Hambanthota. I was awarded as a regional finalist (Asia Region) with the Commonwealth Youth Worker Award 2013 at the event.”
Soon he was invited to take part as a guest panelist on ‘Youth Work’ for the Asia Region Commonwealth Youth Ministers Meeting 2014 which was held in New Delhi, India. He says that his experience in the role as the speaker in the Sri Lankan youth parliament came in handy while taking part in such events.

Next he took part in the 10th Commonwealth Youth Forum 2015 which was held in Malta in connection CHOGM 2015, Malta. He had held the position of Asia Regional Representative (2016/2017) for the Commonwealth Student Association which is the official voice of students across 53 Commonwealth Member States.
The former student of Ananda College, Colombo, had been a former Official Sri Lankan Youth Delegate to the United Nations who took part in United Nations General Assembly 2016. He was also a former UN Youth Adviser on Social Work in the United Nations Youth Advisory Panel 2014/2017 for UN Country Team.
“I am a person who loves to live in the moment. I see each and every achievement in my life as something to celebrate with the same importance as it motivates me to do better in everything I do. However among all these achievements I believe that my greatest achievement was being able to become an Anandian by passing the Grade five scholarship examination. That is where the journey began!” Sachinda explained.
Sachinda’s passion lies in community service work. He is the founder of the H3 Foundation – Hearts and Hands of Humanity; a youth led voluntary organization which promotes volunteerism. Incepted in 2012 with the vision of setting a convenient platform for young people to get engaged as volunteers according to their own capacity and time availability, the H3 Foundation mostly focuses on people with special needs.
“Youth need to play a crucial role for any social cause. Young people should lead the path as pioneers with the energy and passion they have to make this world a better place. Involving young people in social service activities will also give them a different view of life where they could cope and tolerate even the hardest situations in their lives,” Sachinda opined.
“Throughout the past seven years I have empowered many young people across the country by delivering sessions on areas such as gender equality, motivation, leadership, sustainable development, volunteerism etc. I will do the same in the future while expanding the number of beneficiaries. I have been working on increasing youth participation in the democratic process as I have a special interest on that area. Now I can accelerate my mission with all these international exposure,” he said.
Elaborating his future plans Sachinda says, “I also hope to continue my mission of empowering Sri Lankan youth by showing my path to success by setting my own self as an example for a person who has emerged from the grassroots while going through many hardships in life.”
