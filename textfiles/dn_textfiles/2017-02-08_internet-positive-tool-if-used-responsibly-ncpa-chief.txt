Internet a positive tool if used responsibly: -NCPA chief

The Internet could be a positive tool for children if used responsibly, National Child Protection Agency (NCPA) Chairperson Natasha Balendra said.
She said it has a lot of potential to negatively impact children.
“The Internet can be harmful to children as instances of sexual exploitation and cyber bullying are increasing. We need to teach children life skills, problem solving, sexuality education, and how to form good relationships in order to protect them online,” she said.
Balendra was speaking at Safer Internet Day 2017 organised by ICDL Sri Lanka held at the BMICH yesterday under the theme 'Be the change: Unite for a better internet.'
Students, heads of schools, government and private education and training institutions, and many governmental organisations from the ICT industry attended the event.
ICDL Sri Lanka Managing Director Harsha Alles said it is important to have children learn about and how to use the internet.
“The idea that children are digital natives is a dangerous fallacy. Unless we train children in ICT and computer science, many businesses will not have enough skilled labour. As it stands, many children do not know enough about workplace ICT,” he said.
Sri Lanka CERT/CC Chairperson Chief Guest Dr. Ajith Madurapperuma cautioned that the internet has caused most people to knowingly or unknowingly give up their privacy.
He said to combat this, educators and parents must teach children how to use the Internet and not just assume they will behave properly on the web. “We must teach children how to be safe on the Internet. We want to give children the guidance to use computers properly,” Dr. Madurapperuma said.
