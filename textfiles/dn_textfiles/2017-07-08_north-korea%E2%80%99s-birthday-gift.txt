North Korea’s birthday gift

On July 4th, United States National Day North Korea successfully tested an Inter-Continental Ballistic Missile Hwasong -14 and called it a birthday present to the United States. The missile with a range of 550 miles reached altitude of 1,740 miles. It is said that it could reach Alaska or Hawaii. The United States retaliated with a joint military manoeuvre with the South Korean Army shooting a shower of missiles.
This heightens tension in the Korean peninsula. What more it has the potential of developing into a confrontation that would amount to a second edition of the Korean War that ended in the middle 1950’s. The two Koreas are still technically at war since no Armistice treaty has been signed.
The United States has announced that it will consider all options, including military means to contain the nuclear development programme of North Korea. However, the first option seems to be the imposition of more and stringent sanctions on North Korea. The United States has also announced that it would impose sanctions on countries that trade with North Korea, thereby hinting at China. Whether the United States could pressurize China to do so is a moot point. United States maintains that China has not adequately pressurized North Korea to refrain from developing its nuclear arms programme. At the same time it knows that China cannot do so beyond a certain point.
In a frantic response the President Trump has taken a series of unfriendly measure against China during this week. They include sanctioning a Chinese shipping company, placing China as a Tier 3 country trafficking in persons in its annual report on the subject, sending a US Navy destroyer to pass close to a Chinese island in the South China Sea and notified Congress of arms sales to Taiwan.
On the other hand, the United States has not taken any steps against nuclear arms development by Pakistan and Israel, both of which have not signed the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. The United States has the largest stockpile of nuclear arms and therefore its stand against North Korea seems morally unjust.
Both China and Russia are sure to veto any Security Council resolution that will contain stringent sanctions on North Korea. They will weaken the sanctions as far as possible. A joint statement by Russia and China called for a halt to military action by both sides and engage in talks.
The actual fact is that there is no military solution to the Korean issue. What North Korea is doing is to use nuclear deterrent to guarantee its security and territorial integrity. A military confrontation would spread to the entire North East Asia and involve all major world powers.
The only solution is through negotiations. What is urgent is to re-summon the six- nation Committee comprising the United States, China, Russia, Japan and the two Koreas through diplomatic efforts. North Korea is insisting on direct talks with the United States. It demands the removal of the US military from South Korea and a guarantee of North Korea’s security, which is understandable.
Meanwhile, Japan has not signed any peace treaty with either of the two Koreas following its defeat in the Second World War. Hence, Japan’s alliance with the United States in any military alliance or action has the possibility of complicating an already complicated issue.
New chapter in India-Israel relations
A new chapter was opened in India-Israeli relations with the visit of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Israel. It was the first time that an Indian Prime Minister had visited Israel in its 70 year history. Israel was so pleased with the visit and Prime Minister Netanyahu accompanied the Indian Prime Minister during most of the visit.
During the visit the two countries agreed to enhance their cooperation in several fields including agriculture, industry and defense. India will be buying military hardware from Israel and the two countries will jointly produce some defense equipment.
Prime Minister came to Israel after a similarly successful visit to the United States where he was welcomed warmly. The two visits together show a new orientation in Indian foreign policy. It is a shift away from the non-aligned foreign policy which was followed earlier. This shift is further evidenced by the proposed joint military exercises by India, the United States and Japan.
This fits into the American strategy of containing the influence of China in South and South East Asia and weakening any pan-Asian unity or alliance. Taken together with United States defense cooperation in North East Asia and South East Asia it gives the United States entry into the maritime regions of the Asia-Pacific region.
