Karisma Kapoor - Real reason why she is not doing films

Actress Karisma Kapoor on Saturday avoided questions related to the controversy surrounding her divorce and also said that she wasn't ready for films now. Present at the Nykaa.com Femina Beauty Awards, Karisma was asked about the ongoing reports related to her divorce, but before the question could be completed, she said: "No comments, thank you," and walked away.
According to reports, the divorce petition filed by her husband Sunjay Kapur claimed that she had married him for his money and that she had failed not only as a wife and daughter-in-law but also as a mother. He also claimed that she didn't allow their kids, whose custody battle is going on, to meet him.
Karisma's lawyer had said that they'll tell the court he was causing great harm to the children by spreading false stories and by talking about the issue in public. Karisma was last seen in 'Dangerous Ishqa', a film which was hyped as her comeback.
About hardly being spotted nowadays, she said: "I selectively leave the house. I think family is most important and my kids are most important. So I'm very happy being at home, so now you'll ask me if I'm going to do a film, but I'm not ready to do a movie, and whenever I feel like doing it, I will do it."
