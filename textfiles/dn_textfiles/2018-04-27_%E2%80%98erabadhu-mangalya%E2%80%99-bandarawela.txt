‘Erabadhu Mangalya’ in Bandarawela

The Sinhala and Tamil New Year, which falls on April 14, is a celebration that is carried out on a grand scale every year. Although it concerns primarily the Sinhala Buddhist and Tamil Hindu communities in Sri Lanka, the others Muslims and Christians are drawn into the celebration as well.
It is a privilege indeed for one to live in a multi racial country where people of different races and religions have the opportunity to mingle with one another during auspicious occasion like this.
Prior to the arrival of this so called Sinhala and Tamil New Year festival, a spate of celebration is carried out in the government and private sector institutions which is ritualistic and everything that happens is symbolic.

Recently, one such celebration was carried out in the Bandarawela Zonal Education office with the invitation to Bandarawela, Haputale, Haldummulla and Ella divisions in the office premises. This New Year celebration was well organized with the leadership and guidance of the Zonal Director of Education R.M. Ariyadasa, Directors of Divisional Education offices and the additional directors. The office staffs were kept busy engaging in making, baking, storing traditional food items and entertaining the participants. Obviously, a collective effort had been placed and proved beyond doubt by the above in the process of organizing the proceedings.
This is believed that this Sinhala and Tamil New Year marks the beginning of the new year and being optimistic that everything must commence on the belief of any kind must be settled and all bickering resolved, not forgetting laying down a few resolutions for the new year.
The celebration was commenced with religious observances followed by traditional and cultural events such as cross country race, musical chair, pot breaking, placing eye on a drawn picture of an elephant, partaking of traditional food items and many more colourful events and activities had been lined up to promote ethnic goodwill and traditionalism among the staff brimming over with excitement, fun and laughter. The students of neighbouring schools also participated and performed cultural dances to highlight this celebration.
