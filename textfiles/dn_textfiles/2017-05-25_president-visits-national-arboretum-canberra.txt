President visits National Arboretum in Canberra

President Maithripala Sirisena visited the National Arboretum in Canberra yesterday morning.
He was received by the Attorney General of Canberra Gordon Ramsay who represented the Chief Minister of Canberra. Scott Saddler, Acting Executive Manager of the Arboretum was also present.
The President planted a Mahogany sapling in the Arboretum to mark his visit to Australia.
Ramsay said the visit of President Sirisena, who is also the Minister of Environment, to National Arboretum is indeed an honour.
Saddler elaborated that the arboretum was set up after bush fires in 2003 which devastated nearly 20,000 acres. About 44,000 seeds have been planted in the arboretum which also serves as the unique centre of environment learning for students.
The National Arboretum Canberra features 94 forests of rare, endangered and symbolic trees from around Australia and the world. Many trees are still young but two of the forests are nearly 100 hundred years old.
Over 44,000 trees from over 100 countries are growing across the 250 hectare site, making it one of the world’s largest living collections of rare, endangered and significant trees.
President Sirisena signed the visitors’ book as the Minister of Environment, highlighting his vision for a green world.
