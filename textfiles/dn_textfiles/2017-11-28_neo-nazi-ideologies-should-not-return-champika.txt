Neo-Nazi ideologies should not return - Champika

Megapolis and Urban Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka speaking of the Avant Garde issue, said the government has failed to bring politically powerful and well-connected people to justice.
Pointing out that legal action was taken against a teacher who had taken a bribe of Rs. 25,000, Minister Ranawaka said that persons who were involved in the scandal surrounding Primary Dealer Entrust Securities, which recorded Rs. 12 billion worth fraudulent activities, were granted bail in two days. Thus, he pointed out that the government cannot get away from its responsibility of implementing justice despite ranks and positions.
Minister Ranawaka was addressing media at the ceremony held to launch the Beira Lake Intervention Area Development Plan held at JAIC Hilton, Colombo, yesterday morning.
Minister Ranawaka also said acts like celebrating Maha Wiru Samaruwa, jeopardize the reconciliation process in the country. He pointed out that the LTTE murdered innocent people who were not involved in any political movement and the responsibility of their deaths should be borne by those who celebrate terrorism. Minister Ranawaka also urged the government not to allow a return of Neo-Nazi ideologies.
Ranawaka also observed that a democratic government should not allow anybody to celebrate terrorism. He also said that if the military forces did not end the war and democracy was not established, these political leaders such as Shivagilingam will only be “licking the boots of LTTE leaders such as Thamilselvan,” instead of doing politics.
Minister Ranawaka also urged that the country need not lose its peace and reconciliation process for groups promoting terrorism.
