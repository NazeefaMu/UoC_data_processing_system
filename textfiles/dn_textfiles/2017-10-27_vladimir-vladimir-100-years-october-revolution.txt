FROM VLADIMIR TO VLADIMIR- 100 years since October Revolution

RUSSIA: Vladimir Ilyich Lenin — one of the world’s foremost proponents of revolution — set out to replace Russia’s feudal social order with a “dictatorship of the proletariat.”
Lenin ruthlessly cracked down on dissent using the Red Terror, carried out by the Cheka secret police, and his propaganda of lies for strategic advantage.
A century later President Vladimir Putin has expanded Russia’s territorial boundaries with the annexation of Crimea, and has allegedly manipulated European and American elections by using cyber warfare to spread propaganda.
One century ago the Russian Revolution – an attempt to create a more just nation – sealed the fate of the Romanov dynasty, formed the Soviet Union and led to more than 70 years of communist rule. Today, Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin’s embalmed body lies in a Moscow mausoleum.
The centenary Revolution Day* presents a dilemma for Russia’s current President Vladimir Putin. He reveres the Soviet Union, which he served as a Communist party member and KGB officer, but hates the concept of the popular uprising that created it.
Last year Putin ordered Kremlin strategist Sergei Kirienko to tell Russia’s state media companies to play down the occasion -- it should be discussed only by experts and historians. However, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation plans a series of events in St.Petersburg in November.
*The October 24-25 anniversary of the revolution is officially celebrated on November 7 in Russia because the country switched from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar following the revolution.
It is 100 years on Wednesday, using Russia’s old calendar, since Vladimir Lenin’s Bolsheviks stormed the Winter Palace in what is now St Petersburg and took power. Not a lot has changed.
Well, not in economic terms, according to research by Renaissance Capital, an investment bank specializing in the region. It says the Russias of 1917 and 2017 have more in common than might be expected.
Take, for example, debt. Just before the Red October revolution, around a third of Russian debt was held by foreigners. Same today.
Pre-1917, foreigners got 5-8 percent dividend yields from Russian utility shares. Same today.
Pre-Soviet Russia lagged the major world powers in industrial might, but was considered on a par with Brazil and Mexico. Pretty much the same as today.
Raw materials were pre-1917 Russia’s mainstay, comprising two-thirds of its exports. It is still two-thirds in 2017, Renaissance, an emerging markets-focused investment bank, says.
Finally, Russia was the world’s biggest exporter of grain back then. The bank calculates that over 2015-17, the countries of old imperial Russia were again the world’s biggest exporter of grain.
This is not to say, of course, that nothing has changed. The Soviet era, for example, brought widespread literacy, although RenCap economist Charlie Robertson notes today’s most successful areas in Russia are where 1917 literacy was the highest.
The Soviet Union also saw industrialization, albeit uncompetitive compared with Britain, the United States and Japan.
