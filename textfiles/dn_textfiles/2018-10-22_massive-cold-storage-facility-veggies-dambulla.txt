Massive cold storage facility for veggies in Dambulla

Steps have been taken by the government to set up a large-scale cold storage facility adjacent to the Dambulla economic centre to store excess vegetable stocks.
The facility will have a capacity of five million kilogrammes, according to government sources.
At present, bags of vegetables are left to rot with wild elephants foraging on discarded vegetable stocks. Currently, over 10 percent of vegetables transported to the Dambulla economic centre, are being discarded owing to decomposition. At times, farmers have been unable to sell their products for a reasonable price due to glut in vegetable supply.
The cold storage is a much-needed facility and will be a boon to both traders and local farmers during periods where there is an excess supply, a trader at the economic centre said.
Rs.900 million has been estimated under Indian government aid for the project which will come under the purview of the Food Commissioner’s Department and Urban Development Authority and is being carried out on a proposal made by the Matale district agriculture society, its senior officers said.
The construction activities of the cold store will be undertaken by an Indian company in March 2019 and is expected to be completed within a short period of time.
