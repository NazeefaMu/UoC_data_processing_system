It was ceremonially presented to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and Postal and Muslim Affairs Deputy Minister Dulip Wijesekara by Visakha Vidyalaya Principal Sandamali Aviruppola.
A series of events are scheduled throughout the year to mark the school’s 100th milestone. The first fund-raiser is the ‘Visakha Centenary Walk 2017’on February 11 organised by the Visakha Vidyalaya Old Girls’ Association and the School Development Committee.
An alms-giving for 100 Bhikkunis will be held on January 21 at the school premises while a Commemorative Coin will be launched on January 23 under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena.
An Educational Exhibition is scheduled on March 30, 31, and April 1 and the Visakha Centenary Carnival is scheduled for April 7 and 8. Visakha Vidyalaya was founded on January 16, 1917 by Jeremias Dias as an institution of learning for Buddhist girls at a time when such institutions were rare. It was initially called ‘Buddhist Girls’ College’ established at a house called “The Firs” at Turret Road, Colombo. It later moved to its present premises at Vajira Road on November 21, 1927 and renamed ‘Visakha Vidyalaya’ by the spouse of then Governor Sir Herbert J. Stanley.
From humble beginnings, it has risen to the position of the most sought-after school for girls in the country and the only girls’ school to be identified among the first national schools.
