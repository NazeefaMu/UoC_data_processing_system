Nosy nose troubles

Your nose lets you smell and it is a big part of why you are able to taste things. The nose is also the main gate to the respiratory system, your body’s system for breathing. Consultant ENT Surgeon, Dr. Ms. Chandra Jayasuriya (MBBS Colombo), D.L.O.M.S (Otolaryngology), FRCS (Edin) the Head of the ENT Unit of the Colombo National Hospital speaks about some common issues related to nose. These are issues we face in our daily life and here are some possible solutions / treatments for such issues.
Q : What can be done if a child has something stuck in the nose?
A: There is a high risk of a foreign object being pushed further into (up) the nose if you attempt to remove it. Consult an ENT surgeon as soon as possible. A failed attempt by an inexperienced doctor at removing the foreign object may also frighten the child. A powerful light source and special instruments are required. Harmless instruments like a steel ring should be used to remove this instead of forceps. The child should be held tightly and it is important to remove the object successfully at the first attempt.
An object which is stuck inside at the back of the nose should be removed under anesthesia. After inserting a tube into the windpipe, the object will be pushed to the throat (food passage), the mouth will be opened using a mouth gag, and the object will be taken out. Since the tube is being inserted into the trachea (windpipe) for anesthesia, there is no chance of the object entering it.
If the child has put something inside the nose without an adult being aware of it, a bad smell may emanate with a discharge due to the foreign object.
Q: What are the other reasons that cause bad smell from your nose?
A: There are several reasons for this condition. Nasal stones formation (they can form spontaneously), catarrh leading to scab formation in the nose (atrophic rhinitis), catarrh leading to stagnated phlegm in the sinuses (sinusitis), teeth infection (specially the back teeth of the upper jaw spreading into nasal sinuses leading to sinusitis), cancer in the nose and catarrh experienced for an extended period of time may cause a dysfunction in the nerve that helps you sense scents. The nerve may be destroyed preventing the person from detecting any smell from your own nose. It is advisable to consult an ENT surgeon to treat the above nasal conditions.
Q : How does a person fail to smell anything when there is a dysfunction?
A: Nerves responsible for detecting scents are situated in the upper part of the nose. Evaporative chemicals travel up the nose and dissolve in the mucous coating the nerve. These messages travel up the short nerves and are sent to the frontal lobe of the brain which will recognize the various smells.
There are several possible reasons for dysfunction of this nerve. Nasal blockage due to various reasons disturbing the evaporative chemicals reaching the smell receptor nerve can be one of the main causes. Blockages are caused by nasal growths, polyps, catarrh, cancer, common cold. Sensory nerves can also be destroyed due to head trauma, viral infection of nose (common cold), brain cancers and certain medicines or for no obvious reason. An ENT surgeon can treat some of these conditions.
Growths (polyps) can be removed surgically while catarrh will be treated with medications. If a head injury leads to nerve or brain damage, the condition could be permanent. Such persons may fall into dangers by not detecting gas leaks, stale food etc.
