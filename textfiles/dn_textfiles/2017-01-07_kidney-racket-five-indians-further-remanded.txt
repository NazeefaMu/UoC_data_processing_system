Kidney racket: Five Indians further remanded

Five Indian youths arrested in the investigations into a kidney racket involving Indians and Sri Lankans were yesterday ordered to be further remanded till January 20 by Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Bandara.

The Court was informed that Police were yet to arrest the two other suspects who fled the detention camp.
The suspects were arrested for overstaying their visas while staying in an apartment at Wellawatte on March 3, 2016.
