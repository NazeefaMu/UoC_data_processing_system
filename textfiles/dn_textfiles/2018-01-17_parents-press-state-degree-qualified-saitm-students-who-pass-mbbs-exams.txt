Parents press for state degree for qualified SAITM students who pass MBBS exams

The Parents' Union of the State Medical Students demands that the government offer the state MBBS degree to qualified SAITM students who pass required examinations, Union Member Wasantha De Alwis said.
Addressing a press conference held at the Organization of Professionals' Associations auditorium in Colombo yesterday, he said that there are 85 students in SAITM and one of those 'medical students' had done Advanced Level Examination in the Commerce stream and obtained two B passes and one S pass. According to De Alwis, if the current SLMC President and few others try to lower the quality of Sri Lankan medical education and doctors, no Sri Lankan doctor will have international recognition in future.Sri Lankan people should not vote for anyone who destroys or tries to destroy free health service and free education in the country, he added.
Media Spokesman of the Union, Dr. Nimal Karunasiri said that Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha De Silva is acting against the President's instructions on solving the SAITM issue.
