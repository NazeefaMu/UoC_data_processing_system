Lent teaches meaning of sacrificial love: Prime Minister

 
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, in a message released for Easter, said the season on Lent teaches the meaning of sacrificial love, depicted in the life of Christ.
‘Jesus Christ was and is one of the greatest teachers of history, whose message of love and compassion has touched hearts and transformed lives of people throughout the ages,’ the message read.
‘The Cross was a challenge to the political and the religious hierarchy of the day; the Cross continues to challenge Christians to herald in change in keeping with the doctrine Christ preached - that of love, compassion and forgiveness.’
‘The season of Lent teaches them the meaning of sacrificial love that was so poignantly depicted in the life of Christ.’
‘Christians observe Good Friday at the foot of the Cross and rejoice in the resurrection of Christ on Easter Day - symbolising the victory of justice, mercy and forgiveness that form the foundation of selfless living Christ preached, the message read.
‘May Christians everywhere truly experience the joy of resurrection and love for fellow mankind this Easter.’
