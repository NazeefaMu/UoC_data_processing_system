Showery and cloudy conditions over the island and surrounding sea areas will continue due to the low level atmospheric disturbance in the vicinity of Sri Lanka, the Meteorological Department said today.
Showers or thundershowers will occur in the most provinces of the island and fairly heavy falls of about 75mm are expected in the Western, Southern and Sabaragamuwa provinces in particular.
Fairly strong gusty winds of about 50 kmph are expected in the Northern, North Central and Eastern provinces.
Misty conditions are expected in the Western, Sabaragamuwa and Central provinces in the morning.
The Met. Department urged the public to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by lightning activity.
