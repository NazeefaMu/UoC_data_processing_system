Breaking walls within

Nita Fernando is one of the most well-respected and well-known actresses in the Sri Lankan film industry.
Outstanding Personalities features Nita Fernando an experienced, vivacious and congenial lady.
You were awarded the Best Actress Award at the 1998 Singapore International Film Festival. You were awarded the Presidential Award for Best Actress (1999) and the Critics Award (1998). You were also awarded the OCIC Award for Best Actress (1999) among many. What enabled you to reach such heights?
People appreciate my acting and I lived in the character. I did what the directors wanted. I had an appeal to the audience. I was appreciated for the roles I played. I simply did what the character demanded.
What issues in life do you take up?
My film Swara is about HIV/AIDS. It has not been released yet. AIDS is a big problem in society and it is hidden. It is an educational film which touches on how you live with AIDS. And if you are not a person with AIDS, how you avoid it. And how people with AIDS can live their lives like normal people. For others, it is a lesson to prevent. It touches on how to be mindful about blood transfusion. In marriage, there should be a law where both parties check for AIDS. AIDS is spread through blood and sex. The main thing is to educate people to go for checkups. People who take drugs may carry AIDS through the sharing of needles. This is about educating and it is an educational film.
What is it like to be a woman in the film industry in Sri Lanka?
Character-wise, once you establish yourself, you get the character that they expect you to do. So we are selected to do certain characters. If you are happy with the character and if you can work with the director, then it is fine. But there is of course competition among women and men. So jealousy can affect you. The main problem in the industry is jealousy and gossip. Because of the internet, it is getting worse. People who surf the net believe that others should not have a personal life. Information Technology is killing a person’s private life. There is unnecessary gossip which most often is not true. Unnecessary gossip and mudslinging can kill someone’s reputation. That is the sad thing. Everyone has the right to have a personal life. I think this is there all over the world. The film industry has more opportunity for jealousy than any other industry. But you have to be straightforward and tell the truth. I find that truth may hurt, but truth wins in the end. In Sri Lanka, we have an intelligent audience, who are not worried about other peoples’ private business. They appreciate a person’s skills and talents and love you. Our lives become everyone’s business! So you have to be very careful about your behaviour and maintain a good reputation, and that is not easy.
You studied at Holy Family Convent, Wennappuwa. Were there signs during your formative years that you would become famous?
At school, I loved all the dramas and going up on stage. From my small days, I loved to show off. Whenever there was a drama or a concert, I was there. My house was next to the convent. So during the school holidays, I went there and did a little dance, and showed them how I can dance. I didn’t think about being famous, but I loved to show off.
After marrying Elian Perera, you moved to Canada where you worked as a receptionist at the Montreal General Hospital. Was this a tough decision? Was it a tough transition from actress to receptionist?
After joining my husband in Canada, I was in the x-ray department, the main reception. I was there for 18 years and I worked as a telephone operator, and I learnt a lot handling appointments. After three or four years, I became the senior there. Then I became the supervisor. I had to learn French, so I had to go for lessons in the cold weather and it was not easy. It was completely different from Sri Lanka. No one knew who I was, so I had to go for lessons and then cook and clean. But my husband supported me 100 percent. Most of the time, it was cold there. Whether you like it or not you have to sweep the snow in front of the house since you have to get in the car and drive to work. And when you come back, the snow is piled up again in front of your house. After one or two years, I got used to it. Depending on how hard you work, the results are there. You learn a lot and how to respect other people. Of course, I missed Sri Lanka very much. A few people called me to come back and do some films, but I could not take leave because I was new there.
You made your screen debut in ‘Landaka Mahima’ alongside the legendary Joe Abeywickrama. How old were you then and how did that impact you? What kind of influence did that have on you and your acting?
He was a genius. I learnt to relax and act. Just by looking at him I learnt, and did not have to exert myself to act. He was very kind and nice, and he was very good. I was very lucky I started my career with a genius like Joe Abeywickrama. I learnt how to behave and how to act. I learnt how to face the camera without exaggerating or overacting.
You have been part of over 40 films. From those films, what really stands out to you? What made your name? What is most memorable to you?
I would count Lasanda, Hadawath Naththo, Duhulu Malak, Shanthi, Suriyakantha and Pawaru Walalu. In addition, I must emphasize that people liked a lot of the commercial films. I would say that Duhulu Malak really made me famous. But I was not in Sri Lanka to watch some of my films. But people talk and most of my good films, up to now, I have not seen on screen. My film Swara is waiting to be released but I do not know when. I have produced Pawaru Walalu, Suriyakantha and Nisala Giri. Nisala Giri is about the drug problem. I partially directed Swara and Theja.
Your first film role was in Gamini Fonseka’s Parasathu Mal?
No, No! That is a lie! I was never in Parasathu Mal! I was in school at that time! That is absolutely false news!
Pavuru Walalu propelled you to international acclaim. Can you comment on this great milestone in your life?
I won an international award, competing with Iranian films which were good films. It went on Australian television, and then it went to Malaysia. There is a copy in the Japan Archives. I really liked it, because my husband produced it for me. Prasanna Vithanage did a fantastic job. The theme was about a woman who faces difficulties in life. The film brought out the stark realities of life and the human condition. It highlights the frailties of society. I am very happy about it.
What are your latest involvements in film? What are you doing at the moment?
I am waiting for my three films to be released. They are Swara, Theja and Swaroopa with Dharmasene Pathiraja.
What are your future expectations, plans and dreams?
I have no dreams, but I want to be in this film industry playing the characters I want to do. I like doing this very much. As long as the audience accepts me as a good actress, I like to keep on playing good characters.
What strengthens you and sustains you in your career?
Confidence in myself. I don’t give up easily. If I know I am doing the right thing, I go for that. I don’t do unnecessary things and do wrong. So you learn. You have to learn through your mistakes.
What is your message to the youth?
I have no message to the youth really. Because now the youth is more intelligent than us now! But we also have made mistakes when we were young. I think the youth are much more forward and more knowledgeable than us. When it comes to the film industry, there are so many youths who are good actors and actresses. I wish them the best of luck!
To what do you attribute your success to?
I was lucky to play characters that keep me going until now.
Which personalities have influenced you in life?
My husband was the biggest influence in my life other than my mother and father. I have a good friend in my friend Yolanda. She encourages me and she gives me strength.
