UNHRC Chief urges Sri Lanka to make use of CTFRM report

United Nations Human Rights Council Commissioner Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein has said the report by the government appointed Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanism was ‘thoughtful and conclusive’ and urged the Sri Lankan government to make use of it.
He was speaking at the 34th session of the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva today, where representations were made on behalf of Sri Lanka by Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva.
“Although progress to establish transitional justice has been slow, I was heartened by the recent CTF report,” the Commissioner said of the report that recommends the establishment of a ‘hybrid’ court with the participation of international judges, adding that the report acknowledged positive advances on human rights and constitutional reforms in Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka has vowed a credible domestic mechanism, saying the inclusion of foreign judges was contrary to the Constitution, is 'not feasible', and would not be allowed.
