Pears Baby launches trilingual parenting web portal

Pears Baby has launched a trilingual parenting web portal.Being the first trilingual local website on parenting www.pearsbaby.lk contains information such as insightful articles on nutrition, health and recommended bonding activities for you and your toddler. The site also offers discount coupons from featured merchants’ month on month.
While there are many websites that provide information on parenting and childcare, most of these are foreign sites that are challenging to adapt to as they do not address matters from a Sri Lankan context.
Identifying this need in Sri Lanka, Pears Baby launched Sri Lanka’s first trilingual web portal on parenting sharing a wealth of knowledge to address the concerns of local mothers.
The website has been developed with the expert opinions of doctors, mothers and other specialists on the topic and is an assured, up-to-date and reliable source of information that all parents can resort to.
“We realized that Sri Lanka did not have an all in one web portal that provided information on how to prepare for pregnancy, what physical and mental changes a mother would experience during the three trimesters of pregnancy, how to care for your new born and have sufficient information on what to expect during the first 6 years of your child’s life. Before laying out this website we researched about many parenting websites and were able to design this web portal to international standards while remaining locally relevant to our audience,” Pears Unilever Sri Lanka Senior Brand Manager Rehani Barsenbach said.
Barsenbach said this is the only parenting website in Sri Lanka which features a Pregnancy Calendar. This all-important Calendar will walk you through a week by week growth pattern of your baby and the emotional and physical changes you would experience as a pregnant mother through the trimesters leading up to the date of delivery. The site will prepare you to embrace the blissful moments of motherhood with joy.
Informative articles in the website are sourced by an expert panel of specialist pediatricians, nutritionists, dermatologists, child psychologists and obstetricians; who provide up to date advice that is relevant to Sri Lankan mothers.
Additionally, the site also hosts a list of baby names along with their meanings which includes over 1000 name suggestions for your baby. Adding more value to the content of the web portal is the expert advice written by renowned pediatricians on food choices and symptoms to look out for in toddlers at various stages of their growth.
