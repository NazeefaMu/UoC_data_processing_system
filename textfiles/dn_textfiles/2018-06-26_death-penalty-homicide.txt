Death penalty for homicide

Galle High Court Judge Manjula Thilakarathne, yesterday, imposed the capital punishment on a convict in a homicide law suit.
The convict, Kanda Kalasi Udaya Kumara alias ‘Podi Pol’ of Rathgama, who was disclosed in court as a member of a gang of organized crimes, was thus given the death penalty.
The criminal, together with Naiduwa Handi Jagath Bandula and Naiduwa Handi Thusith Indula, had been indicted for homicide of Godawatte Liyanage Lalith Prasanna by shooting on October 13, 2001 at Palliyapitiya in Rathgama Police division. However, the other two suspects were acquitted and released as the prosecution failed to frame sufficient charges against them.
It was further revealed in courts that the convict sentenced to death penalty had been punished with a suspended jail term of 10 years RI and a fine of Rs. 10,000 as he was found guilty of an offence of keeping hand grenades in his possession by the Balapitiya High Court on September 26, 2011.
During the trail, it was also disclosed that the criminal was a bailed-out offender who had been indicted for homicide that occurred at Manimulla in Ambalangoda on August 12, 2011 and keeping illegal fire arms with ammunition in his possession.
Correspondingly, in another case, he had been indicted for an attempted murder of two persons by causing fatal injuries on April 14 2012 of which case extracts were sent to the Attorney General by the Galle Magistrate’s Court.
At the time of the declaration of the verdict, Sergeant Sunil represented Rathgama Police and State Counsel K.V. Indika prosecuted.
