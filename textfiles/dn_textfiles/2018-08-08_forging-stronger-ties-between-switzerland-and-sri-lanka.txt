framework conditions for diaspora investment in Sri Lanka; integration; and projects promoting rule of law and reconciliation.
Delegation-level discussions between the two countries were held at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on August 6, with the Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs Vasantha Senanayake leading the Sri Lanka delegation.
Discussions focused on a range of issues including steps being taken by Sri Lanka to strengthen democratic institutions, advance reconciliation and achieve economic development, and Sri Lanka’s active and progressive engagement with the international community.
Foreign Secretary Prasad Kariyawasam and officials of several ministries including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs joined the Acting Minister at the discussions.
