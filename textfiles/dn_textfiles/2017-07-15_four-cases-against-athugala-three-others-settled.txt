Four cases against Athugala, three others settled

Four cases filed against former Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation (SLRC) Chairman Prof. Ariyaratne Athugala, its former Additional Director General Devapriya Abeysinghe and G.D. Sugathapala for allegedly threatening and assaulting four SLRC employees in 2010, were yesterday amicably settled before the Colombo Chief Magistrate's Court.
When the case came up before Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara, both defence and complainant parties expressed their willingness to settle the cases and the three accused tendered their apologies to the complainants regarding the incident which took place in 2010.
Accordingly,the three accused were ordered to be released from the cases.
Four complainants Kanchana Marasinghe, Herbert Kumara Alagiyawanna, Ravi Abeywickrema and Gamini Pushpakumara alleged that they were threatened and assaulted by the suspects when they demanded them to adhere with the Elections Commissioners guidelines in line with the Supreme Court order with regard to telecasting of election related programmes during the 2010 Presidential Election.
The complainants alleged that the former SLRC Chairman abused them in obscene language claiming that the President and he would not care about Supreme Court orders and no one needs to teach him about the media.
