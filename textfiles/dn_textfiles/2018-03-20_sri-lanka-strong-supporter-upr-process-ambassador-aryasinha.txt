Adoption of UPR Report on Sri Lanka
Sri Lanka is a strong supporter of the UPR process - Ambassador Aryasinha

The adoption of the Universal Periodic Review Report (UPR) on Sri Lanka took place yesterday afternoon at the 37th session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva.
Sri Lanka was represented by Permanent Representative Ambassador Ravinatha Aryasinha and assisted by the Deputy Permanent Representative Mrs.Samantha Jayasuriya.
This was the final report of Sri Lanka’s review under the 3rd cycle of the Universal Periodic Review.
Making a statement on the occasion Ambassodor Aryasinha said that, Sri Lanka is a strong supporter of the UPR process.
“Its peer review nature allows for open and constructive engagement that encourages countries to address important issues relating to human rights, and to learn from each other. Sri Lanka remains firm in its commitment to this process. We also remain committed to constructive engagement with the UN systems and procedures as well as engagement with individual member states in promoting human rights locally and internationally” he added.
He went on to say that in the four months that have passed since Sri Lanka’s review in November last year, the country has already made progress on the implementation of some of the recommendations.
Aryasinha pointed out that on 5 December 2017, Sri Lanka acceded to the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture, and designated the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka as the National Preventive Mechanism.
“We have requested the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka to liaise with the Subcommittee to obtain the advice and technical expertise required for the effective and efficient operationalisation of the National Preventive Mechanism”.
He also noted that legislation to give effect locally, to the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance was enacted by the passage of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance Bill in the Parliament on March 7,2018.
He pointed out that this criminalises Enforced Disappearance.
Aryasinha also told the council that on the recommendations made by the Constitutional Council as per the Office on Missing Persons Act, the President appointed the Chairperson and Commissioners for the Office on Missing Persons on 28 February 2018, making the Office fully operational.
“Progress has also been made in the drafting of new Counter Terrorism Legislation. We envisage a Counter Terrorism Act that conforms to human rights safeguards and other international standards and we expect the draft legislation to be gazetted for tabling in Parliament for consideration, once the established procedures including translation into local languages are completed, shortly,”Ambassador Aryasinha said.
He also said that the Cabinet of Ministers, on March 6,2018, approved the formulation of legislation by the Legal Draftsman, for the establishment by law of an Office for Reparations.
Aryasinha stressed that Sri Lanka has been and continues to engage actively with UN systems and procedures and across all agencies at all levels.
He also highlighted the visit of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention for an official country visit from December 4-15,2017 and Sri Lanka’s participation in the review on the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
He also said that amendments were brought to the Local Authorities Election Act and the Provincial Councils Election Act, ensuring a 25% quota to elect female representatives to the Councils.
For the effective implementation of the National Human Rights Action Plan 2017-2021 which was shared with all delegations in November during Sri Lanka’s review, a three-tier mechanism has now been established to regularly monitor progress being made by all the relevant line ministries and agencies, and to give necessary guidance and direction. All action points specified in the plan are being incorporated into the action plans of the relevant ministries and agencies he stated.
Aryasinha said that the first tier, an inter-ministerial committee, is chaired by the Prime Minister and convenes every 6 months and the second tier, which is an officials committee, is convened by the Secretary to the Prime Minister every two months and the third tier of the monitoring mechanism are ten sectoral committees at the level of ministries.
Meanwhile, on the recent incidents that took place in certain parts of Sri Lanka targeting members of the Muslim community Aryasinha said “these cowardly acts instigated by some organised groups and individuals who have no place in the democratic, pluralistic society of our country. Such acts go against our shared vision of a Sri Lanka where equal rights and rule of law are guaranteed for all. We are determined to take action against all perpetrators of these incidents in accordance with the due process of the law. Victim compensation processes have already commenced; and arrests have been made as well”.
He said after discovering that social media and messaging platforms were being used not only to incite and spread hate and false messages but also to organise attacks, the Government was compelled to impose temporary restrictions on the use of social media.
“All these restrictions have now been lifted. The Government as a result of this experience has now entered into active engagement with social media operators, particularly facebook, to work on the prevention of hate speech,” he added.
Aryasinha also told the UNHRC meeting that the emergency regulations which the Government was compelled to impose on 06 March 2018 as a measure to protect communities were rescinded on March 17,2018.
“We firmly recognise that the UPR should not be a mere three-and-a-half hour dialogue that takes place every four years. Therefore, with technical assistance from the OHCHR, we are already in the process of exploring the best possible mechanism to put in place locally, for regular reporting and follow-up of recommendations emanating from the UPR process as well as other processes including the treaty body reporting and follow-up process. We appreciate the assistance in this regard that the OHCHR has offered us” he added in conclusion
