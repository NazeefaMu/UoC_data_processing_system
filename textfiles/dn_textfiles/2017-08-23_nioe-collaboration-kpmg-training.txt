NIOE in collaboration with KPMG for training

The National Institute of Exports (NIOE) which was set up by the National Chamber of Exporters of Sri Lanka (NCE) to conduct professional training programs and promote professionalism in the field of exports.
It is an accredited training institute of the Tertiary and Vocational and Education Commission (TVEC) and has successfully conducted courses in International Trade Management at the Certificate and Diploma levels for batches of employees in export-oriented enterprises and students who wish to make a career in the field of exports. These programs are continuing.
The NIOE recently entered into collaboration with the International Trade Centre (ITC) in Geneva, to conduct online training programs related to cross border international trade transactions.
The ITC which is a UN Organization which promotes trade and provides technical assistance to developing countries to enhance international trade and particularly exports, has initiated an e-training facility covering cross border trading transactions focused on SMEs and individuals, scheduled to commence in October. KPMG is the international audit firm which provides specified advisory services and constancy related to taxation of fiscal issues among other services to enhance international trade transactions of Sri Lanka.
With a view to further diversifing its training programs, the NIOE has now entered into a separate collaborative arrangement (through a memorandum of understanding) with KPMG. The objective of this collaboration is to provide specialized training to the staff as well as the participants of training programs of the NIOE, who are mostly members of the NCE, to enhance their knowledge and skills in the above specialized subject areas related to international trade.
Accordingly, the following seminars and workshops are proposed to be conducted in the near future. They are as follows: Seminar/workshop to impart knowledge regarding the revised Inland Revenue Act which has been presented to Parliament, especially in relation to taxation which impacts on international Trade. This program is proposed to be conducted at the end of August.
A seminar/workshop related to the abolition of the Suspended Value Added Tax (S-VAT) scheme with the implementation of the Revenue Administration Management Information System (RAMIS). This program is scheduled to be conducted at the end of October.
A post budget forum following the presentation of the National Budget by the end of November. This forum will serve to analyze the taxation and fiscal proposals of the budget and their impact on especially exports. The chamber regularly unifies the services of KPMG to preparation of the government Budget proposed of the Chamber.
In addition to the above, a general program focusing on the Strategic Development of Enterprises is proposed to be conducted (coupled with a breakfast meeting the CEOs of companies) early next year. This program will focus on the achievement of the visions and missions of companies and their development related to their business objectives.
The NIOE and KPMG will continue to identify other important trade-related subjects of current relevance and conduct training programs to impart training and knowledge to participants.
