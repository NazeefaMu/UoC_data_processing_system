73rd Anniversary of the end of World War II:
‘Lessons of World War II remain relevant today’

Russian Ambassador Yuri Materiy delivered an address this week at the Russian Centre in Colombo to mark the 73rd anniversary of the end of World War II.
He rekindled the memory of the allied forces who came together to oppose Nazism, and noted the troubling resurgance of neo-Nazism, xenophobia, and racism around the world
Excerpts from the speech.
"We greatly appreciate the contribution of the Allies to our common victory in the World War II, the decisive role played by the peoples of the Soviet Union who defeated the main forces of the Wehrmacht, and other countries that resisted Nazism.
"Any attempts to falsify the history of the war to erase tragic lessons of history from our memory are unacceptable. Together, we must oppose any attempts to whitewash the crimes perpetrated by the Nazis and their collaborators who were convicted by the Nuremberg Tribunal, and to seek punishment for those who have so far managed to escape justice. Such crimes do not have a statute of limitations.
"We resolutely condemn the destruction and desecration in a number of countries of monuments to those who fought against Nazism and the holding of marches by veterans of the Waffen SS, recognised as a criminal organisation.
"Keeping in mind the fact that the desire to translate theories of racial superiority into practice became one of the main driving forces of the World War II, we note with deep concern the revival of Nazi ideology, the alarming growth of associated manifestations of aggressive nationalism, racism, discrimination, intollerance and xenophobia. It is imperative to resist this in a decisive and uncompromising manner.
:In this regard Russia welcomes the UN General Assembly Resolution adopted on December 19, 2017 "Combating glorification of Nazism, no-Nazism and other practices that contribute to fueling contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance". Given the current international environment, we consider its provisions to be particularly relevant.
"The anniversary of the victory over Nazism serves as a reminder to all of us of the need to consolidate the efforts of the international community based on the principle of indivisibility of security, including in order to develop sustainable immunity to the virus of Nazism and its manifestations, and to prevent the recurrence of the 20th century catastrophe, World War II.
"The lessons of the Second World War remain relevant today and it is necessary to combine our efforts and resources to respond to threats and challenges to our common security and stability as well as to protect the aims of principles of the UN Charter.
"Peace in the 21st century is worth fighting for with the same dedication and determination as it was fought for in the past century.
“We must treat the future of our children and grandchildren with the utmost gravity and responsibility."
