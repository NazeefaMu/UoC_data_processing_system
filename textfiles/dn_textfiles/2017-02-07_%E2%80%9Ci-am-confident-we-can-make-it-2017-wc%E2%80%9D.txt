“I am confident we can make it to 2017 WC”

Finishing as one of the top four sides in the Super Six stage which is a direct passport to qualify and play in the 2017 ICC Women’s World Cup in England will be the utmost priority for Sri Lanka who launches their campaign against India at the P Sara Oval today.
Sri Lanka is just one of 10 nations vying to finish within the first four of the ICC Women’s World Cup qualifier that commences today in Colombo.
“India is the toughest team in our group and we have to win at least three matches to qualify for the next round,” said Sri Lanka Women’s cricket head coach Hemantha Devapriya.
“We have beaten India before, they are not unbeatable but they have improved in their game. Since the time we beat India half the players who represented Sri Lanka at the time are not there today, main players like Shashikala Siriwardena who is injured. But there are a few players of that winning team in our present squad and they have that mindset behind them,” he said.
Sri Lanka is grouped with India, Ireland, Zimbabwe and Thailand in Group A. Group B comprises South Africa, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Scotland and Papua New Guinea. The top three sides from either group will advance to the Super Six stage while also carrying forward points they earn against sides which have progressed from their group.
The top four sides from the Super Six stage, in which each side will play three matches against teams from the other group, will complete the eight-team line-up for the ICC Women’s World Cup 2017, while the top two sides will battle out for the title in the 21 February final.
“It’s an advantage playing under home conditions but there is also a bit of disadvantage also because of the pressure as expectations are high for us to do well,” said Devapriya.
“However the players are ready to perform and take up the challenge. In the last three months since I took over I see about 20 percent development in all areas which is a surprise for me. I expected about 10 percent improvement but I can see that they have improved more than that. Their commitments and the areas they have developed are very pleasing.
“Their attitudes have changed and we worked hard. It was a hectic three months and the players also coped up very well to the demands. We had good preparations. We played a lot of practice games with the under 17 boys overall and they are ready for it. Now it’s all about putting it into practice at the matches and showcasing their talent. They are confident and I can see it in them,” he said. Sri Lanka played a warm-up game against Pakistan on Sunday which they lost by three wickets. But what was more pleasing to the coach than the result was that Sri Lanka was able to top 200 in their innings.
“It’s a plus point scoring over 200. We couldn’t win because Pakistan batted well and at the same time we didn’t bowl well. We didn’t have the pace to bowl on that wicket. The result didn’t matter much because both sides were trying out various things ahead of the tournament. The players know what to do, they have indentified their roles and I am confident they will do their best,” said Devapriya, a former wicket-keeper/batsman of the pre-Test era.
Devapriya said that his team will be banking on senior players like Eshani Lokusuriyage, Chamari Atapattu, Prasadani Weerakkody, Dilani Manodara and Chamari Polgampola to lead their batting and in the bowling Udeshika Prabodhani, captain Inoka Ranaweera, Iroshi Priyadharshani and Chamari Atapattu. Devapriya said that he expected the tracks for the matches would be 50-50 and would give equal chances to both batters and bowlers.
He said that he was pleased to see that the promotional program being carried out by Sri Lanka Cricket to raise the standard of women’s cricket in the country is proving to be a success.
“There about 2000 students keen to play cricket. SLC is organizing an under 21 district tournament for them. At the same time there is a group going around picking talent. That’s a good indication that we will have good players coming through. A lot of schools start playing cricket around the age of 16. I have seen young players but they are not yet ready to make it big, they have the talent. It’s our responsibility once this tournament is over to identify these players and get them into the main stream and groom them,” Devapriya said.
