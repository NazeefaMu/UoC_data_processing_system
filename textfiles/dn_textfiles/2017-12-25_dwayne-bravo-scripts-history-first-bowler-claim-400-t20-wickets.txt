Dwayne Bravo scripts history - first bowler to claim 400 T20 wickets

One of the biggest stars in Twenty20 cricket - Dwayne Bravo is a quintessential cricketer every side wants to have in their ranks especially in the shorter format of the game.
Last Thursday, the dynamic Trinidadian achieved another milestone when he became the first bowler in T20 cricket to claim 400 wickets.
Playing for franchise Melbourne Renegades, Bravo claimed a five-wicket haul against Hobart Hurricanes to help his team register an easy seven-wicket win in Big Bash League match at Hobart.
The hosts got off to a flying start racing to 50 in 5 overs courtesy Doolan and Short before the 34-year old Bravo came into the attack and changed the complexion of the match in Renegades’ favour.
The Caribbean all-rounder started the match with 395 wickets against his name but his match-changing spell helped him to reach the landmark. Bravo picked up five for 28 to become the first bowler to breach the record 400-wicket mark. Next on the list is Sri Lankan fast bowler Lasith Malinga with 331 wickets to his name.
Bravo, first removed Doolan for 26 and then came back to get the well-settled Andrew McDonald for 34 to initiate a collapse.
The West Indian all-rounder completed his five-wicket haul in the last over in which he accounted for Archer, Boyce, and Wade to restrict Hurricanes to 164 for 8 in their 20 overs.
In reply, Renegades lost destructive opener, Aaron Finch, early but Cameron White played a blistering knock of 79 to guide Melbourne to the 165-run target without much sweat. – India TVN
