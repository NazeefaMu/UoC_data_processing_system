Heat wave hits A’pura

The high temperature of 37 to 38 degrees Celsius during daytime caused by the bright hot sun has caused great inconvenience to the people in the Anuradhapura city and its suburbs. Animals and domestic pets too havebeen affected by the hot conditions.
The occasional evening thunder showers experienced in the region had not helped to overcome the effects of the heat wave.
A CEB spokesman said the electricity demand in the area had reached an all time high due to excessive use of fans and air conditioners and other appliances by the people to beat the heat. Demand for water too had registered an increase over the issue, a spokesman for the Water Board said.
Doctors have warned people, especially farmers against direct exposure to the sun as it would cause skin eruptions, dehydration and even death. A farmer in Galenbindunuwewa died of exhaustion recently after tilling his land in the sun.
