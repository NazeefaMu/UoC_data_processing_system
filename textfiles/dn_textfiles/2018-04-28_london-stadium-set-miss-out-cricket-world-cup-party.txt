London Stadium set to miss out on Cricket World Cup party

The London Stadium is set to miss out on the Cricket World Cup party next year when the schedule is unveiled on Thursday.
Hopes that the 60,000 seater stadium could play host to the plum fixture of India v Pakistan appear to have been dashed with Old Trafford expected to host arguably the biggest game of the group stage.
Spiralling costs and a concern over the height and quality of the floodlights for what would be a day/night match are the main reasons for the troubled arena missing out, although there is still set to be a test event at the ground this summer.
With Lord's confirmed as the venue for the final, there is a traditional look to the 11 grounds that will stage the 48 games of the tournament with the Oval, Edgbaston, Trent Bridge, Headingley, Old Trafford, Taunton, Bristol, Chester-le-Street, Southampton and Cardiff completing the set.
The ICC have been meeting in Kolkata where the news has been dripping out with the suggestion that England's opening game will be against South Africa at the Oval to kick the whole thing off on May 30.
Despite never winning a 50-over global event, England will head into their home tournament as one of the favourites thanks to their stunning recent white-ball form, but the lack of depth to their red-ball batting is something new selector Ed Smith will need to grapple with.
“At the moment I could reel off 12 to 15 names of batsmen who could play in England's one day team,” said selector Mick Newell, who is hoping to work alongside Smith. “But in Test cricket we don't have that. We don't have the depth. “There is a number of players who have done well and then faded. All we see to do is talk about numbers two, three and five, so we need to find more consistent players.
“With the conditions no-one is putting numbers together at the moment that is going to threaten the players in the side but the next three weeks will be really important for people to put their hands up.”
The ECB have formed a new working group to look at the structure of men's domestic cricket away from 'The Hundred' with the first-class county game feeling marginalised, while the player's union have also expressed their concern at plans. - Mirror London
