‘Premier likely to contest GE from Kurunegala’

In the forthcoming General Election (GE), Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa is likely to contest from the Kurunegala District, Parliamentarian Rohitha Abeygunawardena said.
He was addressing the media at a briefing held recently in Kurunegala.
He contested the General Election from the Kurunegala District during the last General Election as well and obtained the highest number of preferential votes of the United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) in the island, he added.
