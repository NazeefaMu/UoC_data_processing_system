Keysborough Dhamma Sarana temple
Blissful path

A short distance away from the noisy life of the city, the proud landmark in Melbourne, Victoria, is the Keysborough Dhamma Sarana temple. Nestled amidst a calm and serene locality with its great surroundings providing the backdrop to the establishment of this sacred venue, it is a perfect location for Buddhist activities. It reflects how the splendour of the spot has entered into the setting up of this great institution.
Keysborough temple of ten referred to as Dhamma Sarana Viharaya fulfilling a timely need of the Buddhists in the area culminating in a religious awakening in a foreign land. It is truly a sight prone to Buddha Dhamma.
It is this Buddhist atmosphere and serenity that has been highlighted throughout the sacred venue and it has grown in popularity as a sacred destination for those living in Melbourne as well as Australia. Buddhists in an around the sacred premises take much pride as it is today an impressive place of religious cultural and educational value of great significance.
The beauty of the temple for the Buddhists lay in its layout and management. Now to the temple premises. It has a multitude of buildings all the requisites of a temple. As you enter on your right is the solidly constructed Dharma shala replete with a very spacious hall for the comfort of the devotees in their monthly Sil campaigns discussions and other religious events. As you proceed inwards right in front is the serene Buddha statue for you to worship and gain merit. Few steps away is the initially built residence for monks. Further inside there is the Dhana shala where the laity could freely use for the offerings. Here the temple almsgivings are performed perfectly fine, by the laity under the guidance of the resident monks.
After the Dharmanu sasana (Buddhist sermon) finally there is provision for the laity to share the aftermath of the Dhana (meal). Another attraction to be appreciated are the facilities provided for the disabled on aside at the entrance a rare feature in Sri Lankan temples.
Then outside pristine clear lush green rolling lawns set the scene with multi-coloured flora adding charm and beauty to the entire premises.
On your right Bhodiya with its out spreading branches is the ideal place for the devotees to perform their Bodhi Poojas. The glittering stupa (Chaitya) found in the centre is a beautiful addition to the sacred site.
Mention has to be made of the best Dhamma School in Melbourne renowned for its high standards in religious education and discipline. The contribution made to the younger generation, the young readers interested in learning Dhamma to get the true taste of Buddhism is beyond expression.
All these make the temple premises a marvellous structure. The entire temple complex conveys the Buddha’s message and this is a perfect religious place providing all amenities. The temple as a whole is a clear indication of the vision and religious enthusiasm of the Chief Incumbent Venerable Naotunne Vijitha Thera who has also been awarded the title of Chief Sangha Nayaka of Australia.
He along with his other resident monks and volunteers actively participates in welfare activities to help the deserving and the needy.
They tirelessly helped the Sri Lankan victims during the Tsunami and also of the recent floods and various other calamities. Another noble task frequently carried out by the Monks is the rescuing of cattle from slaughter.
The Nayaka Thera is a reputed preacher not only here but also across the globe. His service to the Sri Lankan Buddhist Community of Melbourne in participating in their most important occasions like house warming Pirith and Dhana etc cannot be appreciated enough. In conclusion, much of the spiritual progress and prosperity of the Melbourne Sri Lankan Buddhist Community could be attributed to the dedication of the Maha Nayaka Thera and the resident Sangha.
