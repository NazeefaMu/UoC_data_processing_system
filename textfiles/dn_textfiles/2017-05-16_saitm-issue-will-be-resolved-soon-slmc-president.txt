SAITM issue will be resolved soon - SLMC President

The political authorities are now moving towards a solution that can be acceptable to the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) with regard to the SAITM issue, SLMC President Prof. Carlo Fonseka said.
Addressing a ceremony held at the BMICH in Colombo yesterday, Fonseka said the SLMC is not the only stakeholder in the SAITM case.”
Now the political authorities are taking steps to fulfill the requirements pointed out by the SLMC in connection with SAITM.
In July 2015, the SLMC sent a team to SAITM for an inspection and the team stated that there are grave deficiencies in training given to the SAITM medical students, Prof Fonseka said.
The SAITM crisis is not a legal problem. If it is a legal problem, a legal solution can be given.
But the SAITM crisis is clearly an issue in the training of medical graduates, he said.
