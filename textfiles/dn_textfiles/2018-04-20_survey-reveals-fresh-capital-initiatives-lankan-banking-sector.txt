Survey reveals fresh capital  initiatives to Lankan banking sector

New regulatory and accounting requirements, tougher competition and disruptive technology will force Sri Lanka’s banks to find cost savings and tap local markets for fresh capital, says Euro Money Survey on Sri Lanka banking sector.
‘Smaller or struggling lenders that cannot or will not do so may well find themselves swept away, analysts warn, by a wave of much-needed consolidation, it adds.
In June 2017, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka said that all licensed lenders would have to meet new minimum capital standards, in line with Basel III guidelines, while any systemically important lender with more than Rs 500 billion ($3.2 billion) in assets must raise its capital adequacy ratio to 14% from 10% by January 1, 2019.
Six lenders currently meet that threshold, notably BoC and People’s Bank, the two largest domestic lenders by assets, and Commercial Bank of Ceylon (ComBank). All other licensed lenders would need to increase their ratios to 12.5% from 10%.
Some have been stocking up ahead of the storm. Sampath Bank completed the country’s first Basel III-compliant debenture in December 2017, raising SLRs6 billion; it plans to raise another Rs 7.5 billion worth of tier-two capital this year. The other main challenge is one that banks face everywhere. New IFRS9 standards set out by the International Accounting Standards Board require banks to set aside provisions for future losses, not just losses already reported.
The new accounting rules are expected to push up non-performing loans and raise risk costs across the entire sector, research firm Exotix warned in a note published in March, adding that certain lenders would be hit harder than others.
The London-based research house says it expects rising NPLs and the new IFRS9 rules to “increase the cost of risk at all” of the lenders it rates: ComBank, Sampath Bank, HNB and NDB.
Industry insiders say the outcome of all of this change will be a wave of mergers – something that has been predicted for a long time but has so far failed to materialize.
Other problems stand out too, each presenting its own headache to lenders large and small.
Net interest margins and returns are falling across the sector, with Exotix tipping average industry return on equity to fall to 14.3% in 2019, from 17.1% in 2017.
Digital disruption has also finally arrived on the island. Local telco Dialog Axiata paid just over SLRs1 billion for an 80% stake in Colombo Trust Finance, a non-bank financial institution, in September 2017, and will use the acquisition to expand into digital financial services.
Euro Money says that it is one more thing for Sri Lanka’s embattled banks to worry about.
