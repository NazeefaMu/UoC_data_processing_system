Bumper yield of water melon, cucumber

The Eastern Province highland cultivators and villagers have reaped a bumper yield of water melon, cucumber popular because of the warm weather prevailing in the Province.
Chena cultivators and villagers who grow water melon and cucumber in their home garden earn an extra income.  The investment is less but the profit is more in this regard.
Farmers in the Province received a massive harvest this time, and are benefited by the programme. At present a kilo of water melon is sold at Rs.80 onwards and cucumber is sold between Rs. 100 and 200.
