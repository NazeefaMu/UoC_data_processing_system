Several Army personnel were notified today to appear before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into Serious Acts of Fraud (PRECIFAC) on July 13 to inquire into allegation on the removal of scrap metal from the Kankesanthurai cement factory.
Former Army Commander General Daya Ratnayake, Major General Mahinda Hathurusinghe, retired Major General Udeya Anasley Perera and retired former Defence Ministry Additional Defence Secretary Siripala Hettiaarachchi are the army personnel notified.
