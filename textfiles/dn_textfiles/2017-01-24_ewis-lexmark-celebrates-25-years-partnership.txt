EWIS, Lexmark celebrates  25 years in partnership

EWIS together with Lexmark marked their 25-year long partnership at an event at the Cinnamon Grand held last week.
The event was specifically aimed at felicitating trusted and loyal customers who have been a valuable part of this partnership that has endured the industry variables of an evolving landscape.
The evening’s proceedings started with a unique twist- instead of the customary heads of the two companies, nine loyal customers who have partnered with EWIS over 25 years and representing the various industry verticalswere called upon to light the lamp, while Sanjeewa Wickremanayake, Chairman EWIS and Leonel Costa, Vice President for Asia Pacific for Lexmark were present,
Addressng the gathering Wickremanayake and Costa took their audience on a nostalgic ‘walk down memory lane.’ It was during this presentation that Wickremanayake reminisced on a journey that was filled with hardships, uncertainty, but always made possible because of a loyal customer base.
“This is all possible because of you, our loyal customers,” said SanjeewaWickramanayake to his audience. “Our amazing 25-year long partnership is only possible because of the trust and loyalty of our customers, who have believed in us, trusted in our service, respected our advice and been a part of this amazing journey.”
Costa then described the transformation of the Lexmark printers from dot matrix to the highly advanced multifunction printers that are now available in the local market.
“In this world of technology where nothing remains the same for long, we have endured the trials of time to remain steadfast in this record-breaking 25-year long partnership.”
Andrew Yeong, General Manager Asia Pacific Central for Lexmark said, “Our strategic partnership with EWIS has been one of great understanding as we share the same corporate vision that puts our customers first. As a recognized leader in imaging and output solutions that help people and organizations improve process and reduce their costs, our award winning imaging and output technology has continued to evolve as the world becomes more digitally connected.”
