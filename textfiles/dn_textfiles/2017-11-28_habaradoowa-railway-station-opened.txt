Habaradoowa railway station opened

The new railway station at Habaradoowa, which was established as a part of a project launched by the Sri Lanka Railway Department to enhance facilitations for train users, was handed over to the public by Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva and Minister Chandima Weerakkody, yesterday.
The new railway station, which is worth Rs. 12 million, replaces the old Habaradoowa train station which had only one platform and will facilitate about 5,000 passengers who use the train daily.
Addressing the gathering, Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation Nimal Siripala de Silva said the new railway station was established as a transportation hub. He observed that the Three-wheeler park, the taxi park, and the bus stand are all inter-connected with the new train station. He also said there is no party politics for development in the country, and these facilities can be utilized by the general public. Minister Siripala De Silva also said that all railway stations will be developed in the same manner where transportation services will be in one center. Minister De Silva pointed out that Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champaka Ranawaka has proposed a large scale transportation hub as well.
He also requested the Railway Authorities to look into similar modern methods which will be practically applicable to Sri Lanka in order to improve the transportation system in the country.
The Kalutara South - Payagala South seven-kilometer double railway line, together with the Railway Signal System, was also opened for service at this event.
The government has spent Rs. 975 million for the project.
The Railway Department plans to build a double railway line from Payagala to Aluthgama as well.
