Microimage Australia, the Australian arm of the Microimage group, a well-established human capital management (HCM) solution provider in South East Asia, has formed a strategic alliance with Businessary Pty Ltd, a specialist in providing business and human resource professional services to Australian and New Zealand businesses.
Together, Microimage and Businessary will introduce a fresh perspective to human capital management to the Australian and New Zealand market, Peter Wijeyaratne, Director Microimage Australia, highlights.
“Workplace dynamics, culture and processes have changed dramatically over the past few years and with the new millennial mindset, and the digital savvy workforce now a dominant part of the employee mix, we are confident that our combined expertise in software and Businessary professional services will be a game changer in the Australian market,” said Peter.
“The Microimage HCM Cloud is a digital HR solution that covers all areas of HR including performance management, recruitment, talent acquisition, learning management, succession planning, employee engagement, time and attendance, analytics and native mobile apps.

This is a globally Microsoft co-sell ready solution embracing all of the Azure benefits.

“Our purpose is to help businesses find a clear path to optimal business performance. Businessary has a depth of knowledge and resources in contemporary HR practices which we provide our clients, and we can see a fantastic synergy in coupling our experience with the Microimage solution to offer our clients and other organisations an HR system solution that is user friendly, intuitive, and easily customised.
