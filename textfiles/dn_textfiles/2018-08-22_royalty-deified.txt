Festival of Taniwella
Royalty deified

In archaic civilizations, kings were regarded as incarnate gods. This principle of Divine Kingship survived into later history.
- Heinrich Zimmer
The cult of a deified ruler is a living and dynamic spiritual reality, in Sri Lanka, even in our own day. Engrossing and captivating rites and rituals are performed, day and night, to propitiate deified rulers. This is amply and substantially proved by the cult of Taniwelle Deity, in Madampe.
This Taniwelle Devalaya (shrine) is extensively patronized by devotees throughout the year.
This cult has continued over a long period of time. Thronging masses of fervent worshippers gather at the annual festival of the Shrine of the Taniwelle deity, in the mouth of August. The shrine is located at the 62 km point, along the Colombo-Puttalam main road.
The well-known semi-urban settlement Madampe provides the backdrop for the sacred shrine. When you travel tourists Puttalam, on your right, at this point, you see the effigy of a White Horse. Next to it, you come upon the shrine (devale) popularly known as Madampe Taniwelle Maha Devale. This site is the sacred core of the cult of Taniwelle Deiyo.
Cult worship
Our exploration of the early era of the cult takes us to the days of King Veera Parakramabahu VIII of the Kingdom of Kotte, Sri Jayewardenepura. To all appearances, King Veera Parakramabahu VIII does not seem to have received much attention from the Authors of the National Historical Chronicle – Mahavansa. But luckily, the folk memory about this king is quite eloquent. In terms of the evidence, provided by folk sources, mass praise of the ruler, has been lavish.
Rajavaliya, a reputed historical chronicle of the land, fills the gap left by the main chronicle at least to some extent. According to this work, the king had a junior consort in addition to his chief queen. The Junior Queen had two sons, by the King.
The King, adept in state-craft, foresaw that the Princes by the Junior Queen had to be assigned tasks, away from the Palace. This stratagem was resorted to, with the intention of averting disputes at court, about succession.
The elder prince was given a Royal Commission, honouring him with the title Sakala Kala Vallabha (The Patron of All Arts). In effect, his responsibility was the development of cultural activities, emphasizing the promotion of religious institutions. King Veeraparakramabahu VIII gave his second son a strange kind of assignment. The younger prince was given the title Dhaniya Vallabha literately the phrase means the Patron of Grains. Development of Agriculture was his official duty. He had to ensure that uninterrupted food supplies were available in the land. Consequently building and maintaining tanks, reservoirs, and irrigation canals, came under his immediate purview.
This is where it all starts.
Different proposition
The masses did not have much of a problem with the expression Sakala Kala Vallabha. But, Dhaniya Vallabha was an entirely different proposition. Dhanya being a wee bit on the difficult side, masses quickly turned it into the easier version - Thaniya. Dubbed Taniya Vallabha, the Prince set to work, and transformed the region around modern Madampe, into one vast green oasis. Bumper harvests kept the people happy. Food trade flourished. Prosperity was ensured. Peace pervaded the whole society.
The inevitable outcome of all this was the emergence of an eminent folk hero: Taniya Vallabha. Prince Taniya Vallabha.
The widespread prosperity and the emergence of the new hero had to several interesting developments. Excess agricultural products – especially the food grains and cereals had to be stored safely. The coastal domain close to the new, prosperous settlement Madampe eventually turned into the reputed granary.
Madampe region evolved into a renowned trading emporium. Merchants and traders from overseas arrived there, to transact business in such commodities as Ivory, pearls, and precious stones and of course rice and other grain varieties.
Prince Taniya Vallabha’s leadership resulted in the production of bumper harvests in the hinterland.
Storage facilities
The stored grains formed a highly tempting lure to the notorious tribe of sea pirates. They would raid the grains storage facilities, close to the coach, attaching unarmed, innocent people who lived in that area.
The marauding unruly pirates were led by Kadirasan Mudliyar. Extremely offended by these high handed and despicable attacks, Prince Taniya Vallabha, decided to put an end to this menace. Empowered and ably supported by the king – his father and by his loyal elder brother Prince Sakala Kala Vallabha, the daring Prince, Taniya Vallabha, in a fell swoop negated the inroads of the pirate hordes. The leader of that evil force was killed during the encounter.
The masses were, understandably elated. The victorious ruler would occasionally indulge in a speedy ride, on his favourite white steed, along the coast – and that too, all alone.
The masses promptly created an image of the ruler. Here is a god-like ruler riding all alone, along the sea-shore (Vella) in the folk mind Thaniya Vallabha, transformed into Taniwalle Deiyo. And the deification was firmly established.
The original Dhanya Vallabha became Tanivalle Deiyo, through this series of verbal transmutations.
Prince Dhaniya Vallabha (Patron Prince of Grains and Agriculture) achieved re-incarnation – through a series of verbal transmutations – as Tanivalle Deiyo.
Picturesque emergence
I am not too sure whether the rich and long history of Sri Lanka can yield a more impressive instance of a ruler being deified, than this dramatic and picturesque emergence of Tanivalle Deiyo.
Eventually, Prince Dhaniya Vallabha came to be massively adored in the form of Tanivalle Deiyo. Folk sources, at times, refer to the sight of the Prince, flashing through villages, or through the clouds in the sky, mounted on his immaculately white horse.
The cult of this legendary deity has continued over a period spanning nearly 1500 years.
At present, the Maha Devale of Tanivalle Deiyo occupies a venue that resembles a spiritual park. Fervent devotees of Tanivalle Deiyo participate in the Annual Festival associated with the Maha Devale (Maha Devale). The series of rituals begins early in the morning. Sacred ablutions and anointments form the primary facet of the Religious Festival. The day’s spiritual agenda culminates with the offering of alms-food to the congregation of devotees. Nearly five thousand worshippers, participate in the ceremonies.
The current curator and guardian of the Shrine is Kirthi Senanayake, who has inherited this office from his ancestors. The shrine of the deified ruler – Tanivalle Devale and the adjoining complex of Buddhist places of worship receive wide adoration. But still, the name Tanivalle Deiyo continues to baffle many, with his mysterious aura.
During seasons of abundant harvests, ardent devotees still claim to have caught a glimpse of Tanivalle Deiyo, flashing across the skies, clad in regal attire, head crowned with an elaborate turban, mounted on his gleaming white steed.
This way a deified a great ruler, can pass into the region of legends.
