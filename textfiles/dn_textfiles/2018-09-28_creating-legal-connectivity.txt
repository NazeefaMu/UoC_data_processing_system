Creating legal connectivity

The National Law Students Conference 2018 has a glorious vision - “Grooming the next generation of legal practitioners and Academics by empowering the law students of the millennial.”
The NLSC, a two day conference will take place on this Saturday and Sunday uniting all law students enrolled at institutes providing tertiary legal education across the country. The event will accommodate approximately 275 law students, the theme being – “Identifying the Legal Practitioner and the Legal Academic of the Millennial.”
Daily News visited the Law College and met the members of the committee behind this extremely timely and most commendable initiative.
“We are holding this conference (NLSC) for second time this year, the first one was organized in 2016. We have realized that there is an absence of a platform where law students studying at different institutions can come together and simply network with one another and engage in an experience that is intellectually stimulating and meet their colleagues who will enter the profession with them. We notice there is an absence of such a platform and the Law Student population is a little fragmented,” said Co- Chair Chiranthi Senanayake.
She pointed out, that in order to meet that gap they wanted to organize the NLSC this year.
“With legal education reforms coming into place, this is ideal where there is a wonderful opportunity where internal and external students of Law College meet one another at the same venue having the same conference experience. The first day is happening at Sri Lanka Law College and the second day is at Waters Edge. We are trying to engage in a journey. The experiences and challenges of the Law Student is very different from a law student who studied law a century ago. Perhaps the environment has changed and the problems you need to deal with are very different. For example you have to deal with things related to the internet or if the entire court system should be mechanized. So the topics discussed in this conference are very timely,” explained Senanayake.
Head of Content Management, Fahama Abdul Lathiff, pointed out that on September 29 there will be ten panel discussions.
“The main panel discussion talks about law and morality and whether a balance can be achieved and how it translates into practical examples such as death penalty. We also have eight breakout sessions where it cover areas such as IL litigation. There are topics that address abortion and adoption laws, or whether the virtual world needs to be policed, how much law enforcement there needs to be online. There are also topics which deal with whether the profession is biased towards a particular gender. We also talk about environmental law and environmental protection. On the second day we have one intellectual discussion. It is called back to the drawing board, and it addresses whether the legal profession has to be reformed. We want the entire system of law to be an effective one,” said Lathiff.
The 275 delegates and the break- out sessions will be happening in parallel, and the delegates from institutions all over the county will choose whatever the session they are passionate about.
Head of PR, Umayangi Wijayasuriya, said this conference is timely and important because there are so many law students all over the county.
“When you think of law we tend to think only about the law students in Colombo and Law College. But here we are inviting law students from all tertiary institutes, so even people studying law on their own, or at private institutions or at Law College, can come together and meet their colleagues. To qualify as a lawyer you need to sit your Attorneys exams. But until people come to that stage they do not know what Law College is about. How the field and process is like. For example some people have not even seen Law College. So we want to give them a taste of what it is like here in Law College. We want to expose them to the legal world. So people will be meeting and talking to each other, who will eventually be their future colleagues. They will be together for the rest of their lives. But here we are giving them a chance to meet each other early. So once they get into the profession it will be nothing new. They will not just be thrown into the deep end. They also get the chance to meet professionals and experts not only in Law but in other fields connected to law. So they will acquire a whole wealth of knowledge through this conference,” said Wijayasuriya.
She also emphasized that everything discussed at the conference, proposals and reforms will result in an outcome document which will be formulated by the delegates themselves and then will be given to the Parliament, Chief Justice, Attorney General and so many other institutions.
“We believe Law students have a great intellectual capacity and they are well aware of their surroundings and they have good ideas and we have the potential to take our country into the future and up to a certain standard,” pointed out Wijayasuriya.
