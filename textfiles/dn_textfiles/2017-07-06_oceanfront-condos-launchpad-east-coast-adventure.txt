Oceanfront Condos:  A Launchpad for an  East Coast Adventure

Nilaveli, just as its name suggests, is a beautiful stretch of moonlit beach. Its inviting shallow waters, diversity in marine life and the ample solitude it offers, makes it one of the most sought after locations in the country. Unlike the frolicking of the Western or even South coast beaches of Sri Lanka that are popular for their kitschy ambiance and crowd beset shores, the East coast flaunts its own quaint charm; one that is undisturbed by the cacophony. This is where Oceanfront Condos, Sri Lanka’s very first beach-front, serviced, luxury, leisure apartments of its kind is located.
"Enjoying long vacations at the Oceanfront Condos gives ample time to guests to discover the lesser trodden adventures of the East coast. Nilaveli’s Pigeon Island is perhaps one of the best hubs in Sri Lanka to enjoy snorkeling with the Black Tip Reef Shark and other colorful coral fish and turtles. With its own designated diving centres and international PADI instructors, Nilaveli offers plentiful opportunities to divers too," states oceanfrontnilaveli in a press release.
Having the space of one’s own, facing the dazzling sea is perhaps one of the unparalleled advantages owners of Oceanfront Condos enjoy.
With its private sea-facing balconies, bedrooms and kitchenette enabling guests to stay indoors if they so please, the Condos offer much needed respite from the rest of the world; a luxury afforded not even by hotels and resorts.
