Malaysia’s Lee on quest for badminton redemption

KUALA LUMPUR, THURSDAY: Malaysian badminton superstar Lee Chong Wei takes a final shot at Olympic gold in Rio, desperate to erase past disappointments and a doping episode that blotted one of the great sporting names.
Malaysia has never won Olympic gold in any sport, and the mild-mannered Lee has struggled with the pressure of his nation’s hopes, suffering crushing final defeats to China’s Lin Dan in Beijing and London.
But Rio finds the 33-year-old back in a familiar position -- world number one, looking strong, and an Olympic favourite -- and he has made clear his obsession to bring home gold this time.
“This is not only my dream but also the dream of all Malaysians,” Lee, 33, said this month.
“I have to make the best preparation since this is my last Olympic Games.”
Lee’s trophy case is packed with virtually every piece of badminton silverware available, but no Olympic or world championship, failures that haunt him.
In particular, those heart-breaking losses to long-time nemesis -- and close friend -- Lin of China in the thrilling 2008 and 2012 Olympic singles finals clearly wounded Lee, and after London many began writing his career epitaph.
Things would get worse.
Gritty comeback
Lee, then world number one, tested positive for a forbidden anti-inflammatory drug at the 2014 world championships.
Facing a two-year ban, he fretted bleakly that his Olympic dream was dead.
But badminton authorities eventually accepted his explanation that he took the drug inadvertently amid stem-cell treatment for a thigh injury.
The episode sidelined him for eight months, however, and he slid down the world rankings.
But Lee launched a gritty comeback after returning to the court a year ago, recapturing his dominant form -- and last month the world’s top rank.
Rio now raises the tantalising prospect of another titanic clash with Lin, regarded by some as badminton’s greatest-ever player.
The rivalry is accentuated by their opposite personas: Lee, methodical and unassuming; Lin, fiery and charismatic.
Their epic Olympic final battles have been credited with fuelling wider interest in the sport.
Also in the Rio mix is formidable Chinese world number two Chen Long -- whom Lee recently overtook on the world rankings. Rizal Hashim, a sports commentator with leading Malaysian television network Astro, said Rio will either confirm Lee’s legacy as an Olympic also-ran -- or as a badminton giant.
