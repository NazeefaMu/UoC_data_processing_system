Postal unions  on strike

 The Joint Postal Trade Union Front said that a 48 hour token strike will be launched by Postal workers from midnight yesterday. The protest is against converting the Nuwara-Eliya, Kandy and Galle post offices to tourism offices, several work related issues at the Head Office in Colombo, not activating and reforming the service constitution and several other management issues.
