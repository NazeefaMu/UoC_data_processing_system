Accident Ward and ETU for Kalutara General Hospital

The government’s aim is to establish the world's best health services that serve the underprivileged, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, the most important task is to serve the poor regardless of colour, political party, etc.
He was addressing the gathering after opening the new Accident Ward and Emergency Treatment Unit built at the Kalutara General Hospital at a cost of Rs. 1,030 million.
Minister Senaratne said investors who come forward to invest in the health sector will be encouraged.
“We will hold discussions and commence projects without taking bribes. Several countries in the European Union have come forward to assist the Sri Lankan health sector,” he said.
The US has agreed to assist and upgrade the health services in three districts in Sri Lanka.
The World Bank has given Rs. 200 million to control Non Communicable Diseases.
However, the existing rules, regulations and procedures in the public service have delayed the progress in using these funds and controlling NCDs, he said. “Kalutara, Panadura and Horana hospitals will be developed.
Accident services and ETUs will be extended island-wide. Children's hospitals will be established in Kalutara, Jaffna, Ampara, Ragama and Galle,” he added.
