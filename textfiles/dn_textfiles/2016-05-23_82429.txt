Trinity’s success this year derives from their all-round strength

Trinity College, Kandy led by spin-wizard Raveen Sayer doing extremely well in all formats of the game completed one of their best seasons in school cricket this year. They finished unbeaten in the league round of U19 D1 Tournament recording nine outright victories, the most by a team in U19 D1 and two first-innings wins whilst their tournament opener with Maliyadeva ended in no-result.
They not only topped their Group with 149.5 points, but also became the highest point-getter amongst the 36 schools competed at the league stage. Trinity, hard to beat in recent years came out top this season, losing only to St.Peter’s in quarter finals of the knock-round round. Trinity at the league stage handed St.Aloysius, DS Senanayake and St.Servatius three-innings thrashings whilst recording outright-wins over St.Anthony’s-Wattala, De Mazenod, Bandaranayaka, Dharmapala, Dharmaraja and Ananda.
Even more striking was Trinity’s dominance in the second leg of the tournament, The U19 all-island limited-over tournament that immediately followed the two-day League round. They advanced to the finals beating St. Sylvesters in the preliminary round, Lumbini in pre-quarters, St.Peters in quarters and Nalanda in semies before they lost the title to St.Sebastian’s in the finals.
Even in the shortest format of the tournament, U19 T20 Tournament (3rd leg), Trinity did well to reach semifinals which they could not make it to the finals as St.Aloysius, a team succumbed to an innings defeat at their hands during the two-day league tourney made a surprise entry into the finals beating Trinity in one of the semifinals. On their way to the semifinals of this T20 tourney, Trinity beat St.Joseph’s and St.Sebastian’s in pre-quarter finals and quarter finals respectively.
It was no wonder they were a formidable all-round force in recent years as far as the school cricket was concerned as their all-round strength meant their strategy almost always paid-off. Whenever they failed in one department, the other department came to their rescue and this collective effort immensely helped them convert probable defeats into ultimate victories. Several outstanding batsmen moved on after several years’ service to strengthen their batting department. Dilan Jayalath maintaining an average of 50-plus topped school’s batting list with 949 runs including a century and 8 fifties whilst Nushan Werasinghe scored 601 runs with two centuries.
Shanmuganathan Shanogeeth who was making headlines as a true-to-type emerging batter also contributed with over five hundred runs to occupy the third spot in Trinity’s batting list.
Trinity’s bowling was heavily dependent upon skipper Raveen Sayer and leggie, Duvindu Tillakaratne who both were instrumental in Trinity’s remarkable success this year. Sayer finished with 77 wickets to be school’s highest wicket-taker with 8 five-wicket hauls and a 10-wicket haul whilst Duvindu came second with 62 wickets.
