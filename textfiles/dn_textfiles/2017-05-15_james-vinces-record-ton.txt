James Vince's record ton

LONDON, Friday - James Vince's record century went in vain as Glamorgan chased down a mammoth 333-run target off the penultimate ball in a 49-over contest to hand Hampshire a three-wicket loss In their One-Day Cup match played at Southampton.
With weather conditions looking bleak, Vince came out all guns blazing and slammed the Glamorgan bowlers all over the park with the intent to score quick runs.
His 138-ball knock worth 178 included as many as 18 boundaries and five sixes, and almost single-handedly put the team on course for a total in excess of 300.
