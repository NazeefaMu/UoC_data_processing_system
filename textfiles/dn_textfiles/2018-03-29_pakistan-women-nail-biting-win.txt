1st T20 International:
Pakistan Women in nail-biting win

After a clean-sweep in the One-Day Internationals (ODIs), Pakistan Women started the Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is) series with a nail-biting one-wicket win over Sri Lanka Women at the SSC grounds yesterday.
The bowlers restricted the hosts to 124 and the in-form Javeria Khan scored her third T20I fifty to seal the victory.
Pakistan won the toss and Bismah Maroof inserted the home side into bat. The opening bowlers - Diana Baig and Sana Mir justified the decision by running through the top order. Sri Lanka found themselves reeling at 38 for 5 before a partnership between Anushka Sanjeewani and Nilakshi de Silva bailed them out of trouble.
Having lost their best batter and captain Chamari Atapattu cheaply, the onus was on Sanjeewani to carry the batting burden. She did not find an able ally until de Silva walked in at number seven. The pair started the rebuilding process in a steady manner before gathering steam towards the end, a 58-ball 61 from Sanjeewani and the 84-run partnership which took just 68 balls gave Sri Lanka a competitive total.
Pakistan did not get off to the best of starts either - losing their openers inside four overs and the score reading 19. However, the experienced duo of Maroof and Javeria counter-attacked to take the momentum away from the hosts.
The 60-run association came in quick time and had brought the asking rate below run-a-ball.
Sri Lanka fought back by sending Maroof to the hut and picking wickets at regular intervals, but Javeria held one end up as Pakistan slipped from 79/2 to 96/5. Sugandika Kumari, who had picked up two wickets, came back to trap Javeria LBW off the penultimate ball of her spell and Mir was run-out, the very next ball.
The match headed towards a nail-biting finish as Sri Lanka needed three wickets while Pakistan still had nine runs to chase, with three overs remaining. The 18th and 19th over yielded only five runs and the visitors lost a wicket as well.
The nerves got to the Pakistan lower order as they lost another batter through a run-out. With four needed off four, Ghulam Fatima collected a brace and a boundary off the fourth and fifth ball to seal the victory in favour of Pakistan.
Scores:
Sri Lanka Women 129/6 in 20 (Anushka Sanjeewani 61, Nilakshi de Silva 35; Diana Baig 2/18, Sana Mir 2/25)
Pakistan Women 133/9 in 19.5 overs (Javeria Khan 52; Bismah Mahroof 42, Sugandika Kumari 3/23)
