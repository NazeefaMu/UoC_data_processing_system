World Affairs Council of Washington features Sri Lanka

The World Affairs Council – Washington D.C. (WAC-DC) commenced the New Year with a programme on Sri Lanka at a reception hosted by Ambassador Prasad Kariyawasam for members and guests of the WAC-DC at the Sri Lanka Residence on January 12.
This event coincided with the National Integration and Reconciliation Week observed in Sri Lanka and the second anniversary of the inauguration of President Maithripala Sirisena.
The WAC-DC, a leading forum for global education and international affairs, is a non-partisan organisation dedicated to expanding awareness among the American public and the international community of geo-political, business, and civil society issues. The event at the Sri Lanka Residence was formally opened by the President and CEO of the WAC-DC Tony Culley-Foster who introduced Sri Lanka and the Ambassador to the guests.
Addressing the audience, Kariyawasam referred to attributes of Sri Lanka in relation to its history, geo-strategic location, natural resources and physical quality of life of the people. With regard to Sri Lanka–U.S. relations, the Ambassador highlighted the upward trajectory of the bilateral relationship since the election of President Sirisena on January 8, 2015. Relations are now poised to advance further as the United States and the international community welcome a new U.S. Administration.
The Ambassador’s remarks were followed by questions from the guests.
On this occasion, in recognition of his commitment to global education and international affairs, Kariyawasam was presented with a certificate of appreciation by Dr. Doug Shaw, Chair of the Board of Directors of the WAC-DC.
