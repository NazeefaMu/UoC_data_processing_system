Human-elephant conflict in Anuradhapura
Gigametre-long protective fence to be erected soon

Incidents related to the human-elephant conflict had been on the rise in the Anuradhapura district recently. Investigations had revealed that the prevailing drought had created a scarcity of food and water in jungle areas and hence, elephants had been forced to wander into villages in search of food. According to Anuradhapura Wildlife Conservation Department sources, the most-affected Divisional Secretariat jurisdictions were Medawachchiya, Kebithigollewa, Kahatagasdigiliya, Thirappane, Nuwaragampalatha, Horowpothana and Galenbindunuwewa.
Meanwhile, Sustainable Development, Wildlife and Regional Development Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka, during a meeting on the human-elephant conflict held in Anuradhapura, said the ministry had sufficient funds to find solutions for issues concerning the matter, such as the inadequacy of protective electric fences, scarcity of elephant crackers, insufficient manpower for wildlife conservation activities as well as the lack of infrastructural facilities at national sanctuaries.
He said that Rs. 500 million was already available at the ministry, in addition to a Rs. 900 million fixed deposit. Referring to the electric fences, the minister said that in addition to the current 4-Gigametre (Gm)-long fence, steps would be taken to erect an additional protective fence spanning 1 Gm.
Field Marshal Fonseka said there would be a new approach to address the issue with villagers of the affected areas; Wildlife Conservation officials and 3,000 civil security guards attached to the department would participate in a human-elephant conflict prevention programme soon.
He said that he was determined to put an end to the issue, which had affected the country for nearly 70 years.
A Wildlife Conservation Department spokesman said the new concept would target to erect reinforced electric fences around villages or village clusters in contrast to the previous system, which only focused on erecting protective fences around forest reservations and jungle belts.
Initiated in the Galgamuwa Divisional Secretariat division in Kurunegala as a pilot project, the programme had proven to be successful. The system is yet to be introduced to the Anuradhapura district. Plans are underway to construct the new electric fence system in the Nekatunawewa, Kahatagollewa, Ataweeragollewa, Kattamurichchana and Nayakapuwewa areas, where wild elephant invasions occur regularly.
According to Wildlife Conservation Department sources, the scarcity of elephant crackers had been a setback in driving away invading jumbos. Although around 10,000 crackers are required as a monthly quota, only half the number is currently issued.
Meanwhile, a proposal to establish a Weta Samithiya (fence society) in the affected areas, to overlook matters related to electric fences, is yet to be approved.
