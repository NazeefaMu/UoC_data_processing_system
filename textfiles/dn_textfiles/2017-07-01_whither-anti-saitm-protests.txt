Whither anti-SAITM protests

“But an appraisal of a provisional revolutionary government's significance would be incomplete and wrong if the class nature of the democratic revolution were lost sight of. The resolution therefore adds that a revolution will strengthen the rule of the bourgeoisie. This is inevitable under the present, capitalist, social and economic system. And the strengthening of the bourgeoisie's rule over the proletariat that has secured some measure of political liberty must inevitably lead to a desperate struggle between them for power, must lead to desperate attempts on the part of the bourgeoisie to take away from the proletariat the gains of the revolutionary period. Therefore the proletariat, which is in the vanguard of the struggle for democracy and heads that struggle, must not for a single moment forget the new antagonisms inherent in bourgeois democracy, or the new struggle”.
This is what Lenin said about a democratic revolution that was in the agenda in Russia in 1905. Workers should be very conscious of the democracy they get in the course of the struggle. However in the past period in developing countries, so called socialists spread the idea that workers and oppressed youth should fight for socialism even at the expense of democracy.
These Neanderthal socialists were for an extreme dictatorial regime in the name of socialism. Lenin's arguments given above on his views about the transition from a repressive, authoritarian regime to a more democratic dispensation in Russia show clearly the importance of democracy for the emancipation of worker.
But both in '71 and '88 we saw youth in this country fighting under extreme dictatorial organisations for mythical liberation and socialism. Clearly this kind of liberation does not flow from the teachings of Marx, Engels or Lenin. These ideas are related to populist socialists who believed in resurrection of Asiatic mode of production in this era of modernism. Marx explained that in India and other Asiatic countries, before European intervened, Asiatic commune system prevailed.
“In those of the simplest form, the land is tilled in common, and the produce divided among the members. At the same time, spinning and weaving are carried on in each family as subsidiary industries.
Asiatic societies
Side by side with the masses thus occupied with one and the same work, we find the ‘chief inhabitant,’ who is judge, police, and tax-gatherer in one; the book-keeper, who keeps the accounts of the tillage and registers everything relating thereto; another official, who prosecutes criminals, protects strangers travelling through and escorts them to the next village; the boundary man, who guards the boundaries against neighbouring communities; the water-overseer, who distributes the water from the common tanks for irrigation; the Brahmin, who conducts the religious services; the schoolmaster, who on the sand teaches the children reading and writing; the calendar-Brahmin, or astrologer, who makes known the lucky or unlucky days for seed-time and harvest, and for every other kind of agricultural work; a smith and a carpenter, who make and repair all the agricultural implements; the potter, who makes all the pottery of the village; the barber, the washer man, who washes clothes, the silversmith, here and there the poet, who in some communities replaces the silversmith, in others the schoolmaster.
This dozen of individuals is maintained at the expense of the whole community. If the population increases, a new community is founded, on the pattern of the old one, on unoccupied land. The whole mechanism discloses a systematic division of labour; but a division like that in manufactures is impossible, since the smith and the carpenter, &c., find an unchanging market, and at the most there occur, according to the sizes of the villages, two or three of each, instead of one.
The law that regulates the division of labour in the community acts with the irresistible authority of a law of Nature, at the same time that each individual artificer, the smith, the carpenter, and so on, conducts in his workshop all the operations of his handicraft in the traditional way, but independently, and without recognizing any authority over him.
The simplicity of the organisation for production in these self-sufficing communities that constantly reproduce themselves in the same form, and when accidentally destroyed, spring up again on the spot and with the same name this simplicity supplies the key to the secret of the unchangeableness of Asiatic societies, an unchangeableness in such striking contrast with the constant dissolution and refounding of Asiatic States, and the never-ceasing changes of dynasty. The structure of the economic elements of society remains untouched by the storm-clouds of the political sky”.
Healthcare services countrywide came to ‘standstill’ recently as a result of the work stoppage by the members of the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) over the SAITM issue. The logic of this action and the ethical standing of the GMOA leadership revealed from their statements show strong affiliating to Asiatic populist politics. GMOA Assistant Secretary Nalinda Herath told a news conference that they would not stop their trade union action until the government accedes to their demands on the SAITM issue.
Actually SAITM issue is created by the IUSF and GMOA came in support of student struggle. Attack on students attracted sympathy of the general public though many complained about blocking the roads and traffic created. GMOA wanted SAITM issue to be in the fore front.
“This strike will only be successful when we win this battle. Minister Rajitha Senaratne has said the government will take tough action against the striking doctors. We will be forced to toughen our stance if he does so,” said, Dr Herath.
At the same time, GMOA Media Spokesman Samantha Ananda said the final phase of the battle against SAITM has now arrived and that the government should resolve this matter without further delay.
Civil organisations
He said they had made five suggestions which the government could easily implement in resolving this matter. “According to their suggestions, the Health Minister should gazette the minimum standards of medical education and the Higher Education Minister should inform the courts that SAITM does not have the compliance certificate given by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC). The government should stop SAITM from enrolling new students,” Dr. Ananda said.
However, the GMOA position at that stage was, it would continue the countrywide strike until the government addressed their demands on SAITM.
Later GMOA called off the strike after discussions with the President. Apparently President has assured that all their demands will be carried out. May be so! On the other hand strike was not acceptable to the people. Striking doctors expected the suffering of patients, physical depreciation and death will agitate family members and friends, and that in turn will push public against the government. In general, such was the repercussion in the past.
But this time people were aware of the contradictory nature of the SAITM issue. If the demand is to develop SAITM and satisfy the standard expected by the Medical Council then all will agree. But instead to demand abolish or nationalization of SAITM, created serious doubts among the masses. That went against the striking doctors. In many places there were attacks on striking doctors. It is true that many unions and left organisations urged the government to resolve the SAITM issue through a consultative rather than a confrontational process. Still many civil organisations campaigned openly against the strike.
FUTA Secretary Prof. Arjuna Parakrama condemned the attack on the protesting university students and said the violent repression of legitimate protests must cease. “Conflicts and differences of opinion should be resolved through informed discussions free from violence and intimidation. Continued indifference to this matter will only lead to unrest in the national university system,” he said. Prof. Parakrama insisted that the government must stand by its commitment to the right to protest and dissent. “We were led to believe that violent repression of legitimate dissent was a thing of the past, but it does not appear to be so,” said Prof. Parakrama.
Inter University Students Federation (IUSF)
Also he said those responsible for ordering the excessive use of force on the students must be held accountable. “The FUTA wants the crisis in higher education to be addressed on a priority basis and that the SAITM issue which is a symptomatic example of this crisis be resolved immediately,” he said. Prof. Parakrama said further that the State Medical Faculty students had boycotted lectures for four months, and university student unions across the country, including the Inter University Students Federation (IUSF), had staged demonstrations, seeking a positive response from the government on the SAITM issue. “FUTA does not condone the increasingly confrontational protests by students, but at the same time the gratuitously violent state response should be condemned in the strongest possible terms. These are university students and future leaders of this country,” he said.
That is interesting. However a leading person in the Medical Union said that if students are dissatisfied with the solutions given, they could take up arms as they did in 1988. This reveals the populist political ideology of the leaders of this struggle. Populist socialist vision in the end leads to Polpotian tyranny, sans democracy, sans justice.
