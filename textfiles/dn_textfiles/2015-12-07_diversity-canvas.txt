Sri Lankan Art 2015
Diversity on canvas

Guests at the openingMedusa by Sathsara IlangasingheAn exhibitArtist Sudath Abeysekera
The JDA Perera Gallery is now host to a vibrant range of artistic expression, courtesy of one of Sri Lanka's biggest promoters of local art, the George Keyt Foundation. The annual exhibition was opened on December 1 at the gallery, with the Chairman of the Sapumal Foundation Rohan De Soysa attending as Chief Guest.
The exhibition which will be held until December 6, features an interesting and varied selection of art, from still-life, to conceptual, very fluid, abstract pieces and even a few sculptures.
Forty-eight artists were selected for the exhibition from all over the country. Chief Guest De Soysa, in an impassioned speech that opened the event, said: "The soul and psyche of the nation was indeed nourished by its artists and its poets."
The diversity of the exhibits is what makes it such a treat to browse through. You move from the subtle, familiar lines of Michael Anthonisz's portrait sketches, to the wild, colourful surrealism by Sathsara Ilangasinghe, a few paintings after. The artists featured are an interesting mix of styles - from charcoal to oil paints to mixed-media. There is something for everyone to appreciate.
Some of our personal favourites included: Sudath Abeysekera's 'Landscape with Gold Sky', a very emotive abstract series of paintings featuring harsh splatters and warm contrasts, Nirmala De Alwis's 'The Irony', a loud conceptual suggestion of an elephant's face, staring back unapologetically at the onlooker, Achala Gunawardana's 'A Landscape,' an abstract conceptualization of a landscape, exuding a sense of soothing calmness and quietness, Sathsara Ilangasinghe's 'Medusa', an unforgettable, surreal depiction of a little girl Medusa, with a head of wiggling pink snakes, her arms holding demurely a white cat, and Ruwan Upasena's 'Conventional Man' series, surreal and dream-like, with hints of man, nature and machine, in mixed-media of cool colours and sharp lines. Another work of art memorable for its message was 'Brotherhood Avenue' by Anura Srinath, featuring children of different religions playing together on the beach.
Sri Lankan Art 2015 is not just a showcase of talent, interesting to only artists and those who frequent galleries, but it is a collection of intriguing, well-elaborated stories told through the artist's paintbrush and sculpting tools.
Visitors at the exhibition also get a catalogue booklet, with artists' names and contact numbers in case you enjoy the work so much that you want to talk to the artist or purchase his or her art.
