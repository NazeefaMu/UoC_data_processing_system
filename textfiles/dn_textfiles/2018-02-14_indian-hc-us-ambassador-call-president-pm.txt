Indian HC, US Ambassador call on President, PM

The United States Ambassador to Sri Lanka Atul Keshap and the Indian High Commissioner in Sri Lanka Taranjit Singh Sandhu had met President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe separately yesterday.
The NewsIn.Asia website reported that Sandhu had met the President and Prime Minister ahead of his departure for New Delhi to meet the new Indian Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale.
The website further reported that the meetings with Indian High Commissioner had been pre-arranged and had nothing to do with the current political situation in Sri Lanka. The envoy discussed with the two Sri Lankan leaders, bilateral matters and issues of mutual interest.
Other media reports however stated that the US Ambassador had met with the President to try and diffuse the current political situation.
