Potter now a middle-aged father of three!

Rowling reveals two-part play based on her books depicts wizard 19 years after leaving Hogwarts
For almost two decades, children have grown up enthralled by the adventures of Harry Potter as an aspiring young wizard, pitching his wits and wonder against his nemesis Voldemort.
But a new play presents a rather more prosaic picture of the former pupil of the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
In what will come as a shock to his legion of fans, Potter is now a middle-aged father of three, trying to cope with an overburdened in-tray in his job at the Ministry of Magic.
His youngest son, Albus, is struggling to cope with growing up as the son of a celebrity wizard.
Based on a new story by JK Rowling, the author of the seven Potter novels, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child will have its West End premiere next year.
The play is being staged in two parts, intended to be seen in order, either as a matinee and evening performance or on consecutive evenings.
The device effectively guarantees that audiences will pay twice to see the full show.

The play, written by Jack Thorne, is expected to sell out quickly, given the success of Rowling's books, which sold more than 400?million copies worldwide, and their film adaptations.
On Twitter, Rowling told fans yesterday: “So now you know it really isn't a prequel: Harry Potter and the Cursed Child starts 19 years later!”
She added: “The story only exists because the right group of people came together with a brilliant idea about how to present Harry Potter on stage.

“I'm confident that when audiences see Harry Potter and the Cursed Child they will understand why we chose to tell this story in this way.”
Rowling, Thorne and a third writer, John Tiffany, said they wanted to explore Harry's world “in a brand new way through the live form of theatre”.
They added: “Collaborating on this story is exhilarating for all of us, and we can't wait to present the eighth story next summer.”
The publicity material promises a show as enthralling as the novels.
It states: “While Harry grapples with a past that refuses to stay where it belongs, his youngest son Albus must struggle with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted.
As past and present fuse ominously, both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: sometimes, darkness comes from unexpected places.”
Four special preview performances are planned for the end of May, details of which will be announced at a later date. The main previews begin at London's Palace Theatre on June 7, with the opening performances on July 30.
