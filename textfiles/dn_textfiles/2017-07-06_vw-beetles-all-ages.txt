VW BEETLES OF ALL AGES

World Volkswagen Day 2017
Galle Face Hotel is gearing up to host World Volkswagen Day 2017 on July 9. Volkswagen clubs across the world usually commemorate this annual celebration on June 22. The hotel will be hosting this year’s celebration in collaboration with the Volkswagen Beetle Owner’s Club.
On July 9 a splendid parade will kick start the grand event from the Galle Face Hotel and proceed along Galle Road towards Mt. Lavinia Hotel where the grand finale will take place. Brightly coloured Volkswagen cars of all ages and models will throng at the Galle Face Hotel to the delight of the country’s classic car buffs. A Recorder’s Table will be set up at the hotel to register this cherished collection of Beetle cars. Following the registration process, the Volkswagen Beetle Owner’s Club, President, Peter Jasinghe will propose the welcome address and offer instructions regarding the parade. Complimentary tea and coffee will be served to the participants prior to the commencement of the parade.
There will also be a raffle draw of a prized Classic VW Beetle, following a tradition upheld by many motoring clubs, where a raffle draw is held and a Classic car in Mint condition is offered as the Grand Prize. Tickets will be sold at the hotel for those who wish to try their luck in winning a once in a life time chance of becoming a proud owner of a pristine condition Classic VW Beetle.
