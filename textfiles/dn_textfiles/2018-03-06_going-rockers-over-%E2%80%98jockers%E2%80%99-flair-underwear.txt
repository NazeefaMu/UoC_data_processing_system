Going  rockers over  ‘jockers’ with a flair for underwear!

Today I take on the brief of writing an incomplete look at the history of men's underwear. No one can disprove the reality that following the invention of Father Adam’s fig leaf various styles of underwear have evolved.
After people learned to weave cloth, the loincloth became the earliest form of underpants. And it still continues to be in many rural parts of Sri Lanka. So remember that the so called innovative designer unmentionables were invented by the Sri Lankan farmer and fisherman over 2,500 years ago. It is called a breechcloth, a narrow loincloth supported by a waistband. We call it an ‘amude.’ It is the most practical and comfortable nether garment ever invented.
As far as I recall since the 1950s most middle and upper class Sri Lankan men opted for jockstraps as under-clothing, although they were primarily designed for athletes and sportsmen to give their procreative appendages solid support. Perhaps their brevity and easy-to-wash convenience made them popular among local males for everyday use, even though they were far from being athletic types.
The not-so affluent however opted for the more affordable underwear called the ‘lunket’ which I believe was uniquely Sri Lankan. Small time local tailors made a killing with bits of waste cloth to turn out cotton type thongs the size of skimpy, hanky-panky lingerie! They were certainly not the cutting edge of designer underwear and depending on the choice of material could cut into the area where your thighs begin.
The ‘lunket’ actually resembled a woman’s bikini bottom with three straps of the same material sewn into the left side to facilitate tying them in place. Even if one of the perilously slender straps snapped you could be assured that the thingamajig stayed in place. I do believe that they were later copied by international designers to reinvent the feminine bikini bottom. And the colours dear readers ranged from pastels of all shades to polka dots.
Now back to the jockstraps. Most people called them jocks. I added a more fanciful sobriquet to the nether supporters by rechristening them ‘Jockers’ and alternately ‘Jockeroos.’ I still do and so do the grandkids who always take a leaf from their irrepressible old DaDa, much to the chagrin of the family matriarchs.
I concede they are right because one must exercise caution when being jocular with a jockstrap. Take a closer look and you would be sure to observe that at a pinch it could be used as a slingshot. Yes siree, with its matching elastic straps and cotton pouch it could serve as great material for a ready-made catapult.
You see, the family kids refer to their cotton briefs, or any type of underwear for that matter, as ‘Jockers.’ It is also true that both grandsons Rex Tharindu (13) and Kingsley (9) wear the Real McCoy jockers because they both represent their school Under-XIII cricket team.
For further protection in the event a spinning or swinging ball hits you ‘down under’ is a hard cup that fits inside your ‘jockers’. The cups are hard material inserts and when a rock hard cricket ball hits one it’s called ‘ringing the bell,’ which rhymes with hell, which is what it hurts like.
But I must say that rather than a ringing tone it sounds more like a sickening clunk which can be heard all around the ground even without the aid of the new-fangled stump microphones. And imagine the terrifying prospect of being hit where it hurts most without the protection of a groin guard.
Cricketers are advised: ‘Don’t leave home for a game without it!’ It is politely known as a box or abdo-guard and provides ample protection to the … shall we say, pelvic region. But the players commonly refer to it as a ball guard. And you had better have your own because most players aren’t up for sharing!
There is an old cricket joke that the first box was used in cricket in 1874 and the first cricket helmet was used in 1974. So we know that the earliest players had their bits and pieces in mind and were taking measures to look after them! Another startling facet that strikes us is that it took men 100 years to realise that their head and brains were equally important.
But I have been digressing from the subject of men’s under things although other allied appurtenances mentioned of unmentionables have been brought into play. Time was when the key word was unmentionables and it only mattered to mothers that they were clean. You never knew, after all, when you might be knocked down by a bus.
Many are perhaps unaware that Yankee manufacturers have conjured up rump plumper undies that are booty boosters for ‘flat-arse’ males. I am acquainted with several such un-endowed chaps who could certainly benefit from such an accoutrement. But I suspect it is constricted despite its promise of being like a big smile. I mean, it sounds great that it makes your cheeks go up but if it is too taut you will feel the pinch.
The fashion pundits say you can tell a lot about a person from his underwear, but the catch is that only a very few people will see it, unless you want them to. Surely, it is one of the most private and personal decisions in menswear. Yet it is worn every day, all day, right next to the skin.
As such, comfort is paramount in underwear and while many men prefer one kind of underwear, it makes more sense to choose the style based on the day’s activity. Your undergarments are often the unsung heroes of your wardrobe.
Even then, it’s still early days for the male underwear. Women’s lingerie has seen an amazingly large number of brands entering the market but men too are conscious of what they wear inside. In Sri Lanka, the underwear market is only beginning to evolve and the brief remains the most popular cut in men’s underwear.
So, things have moved swiftly from not having any choice in underwear to more than 40 odd styles in colours enough to give the rainbow technicolour nightmares. They come in lots of different cuts, such as high-waisted, G-string, hip-huggers, high and low rise as well as briefs, boxers, trunks, ‘jockeroos’ and swimwear. And except for boxers and ‘jockers’ no one can distinguish between swimwear from underwear. This is fortified by an incident at a Colombo boutique hotel pool when I decided to join the kids for a splash.
It was during the busy lunch hour when the verandahs were chock-full of diners. That was when the beastly grand-brats yelled at the top of their voices: “Hey Dada, are those your swimmers or your jockers?” [email protected]
