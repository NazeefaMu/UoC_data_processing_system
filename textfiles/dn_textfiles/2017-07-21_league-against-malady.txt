In league against the malady

It took more than seventy years for our country to eliminate malaria which killed more people than wars have ever done. The state workers, both officers and their subordinates worked with great devotion and sacrifice to successfully end the man’s fight against (Anopheles) a mosquito. From house to house, office to office, pits to drains, to streams and river beds, everywhere where water was stagnated, homesteads to lands and in all malarious areas, they sprayed insecticides. It was by an organised body called the “Anti-Malaria Campaign” that worked every day everywhere in the country not, on a particular day or in a particular place intermittently. It was a regular operation, a non-stop operation throughout seven decades.
The anti-malarial used prior to 1925 had been ‘Quinine’. Whilst in the same year ‘pamaquin’, ‘mepacrine’ was introduced in 1930, ‘Paludrine’ was discovered in 1944. I remember having swallowed that yellowish tiny ‘Quinie’ tablet sharp in taste during an era when the entire country was inundated by the epidemic. I was a brat of five years when these discoveries went into the annals of history. But, when ‘Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane’ abbreviated as DDT was introduced in the fifth decade of the bygone century, I was a well-bred chap who understood the society. I well remember the way how they launched the campaign. I was a victim of the mosquito.
Mosquito breeding places
The spraying of this insecticide took place in the form of an attack on our houses. The houses were turned upside down and looked ransacked at the end of the operation. On the beds and underneath, on the mattresses and underneath, on the walls, on the ceilings, roofs, reefs and rafters, on the furniture, kitchens, toilets, bathrooms, lavatories and the backyards were sprayed leaving nothing in the precincts or in the environs. This was done in each and every house in the country. Its chemical action was so powerful that the heat of it and the smell remained for many months with un-faded patches. And, no land, no estate, no drain, no stream, no brook side, no riverbed, shrubbery, forest or jungle was spared.
As we reached the stage of ending malaria, a pandemic pestilent disease known as dengue began to spread in the country caused by
(Aedes aegypti) another mosquito. As it grew into an epidemic in 2013, the Health Minister was compelled to get down to the streets in Colombo to study the sanitary situation in the city where he found mosquito breeding places in large scale, stagnant and contaminated water and decomposed garbage everywhere he went.
Awakened by the knock up of the Minister, there were a number of Public Health Inspectors in uniforms after six decades galloping behind to keep pace with him who was leading faster than them in post-haste. All television stations have telecast this instance.
The appearance of the Public Health Inspectors who disappeared about six decades ago was a matter for the surprise for me because these invincible people were not visible in locations where they should have been in their uniforms until the Minister’s knock up. They gave it up on their own accord and reported to work, occupied seats in civvies and became white collar workers playing up with people whom they should have inspected regularly. This high handed act existed because of the negligence of the health department and the successive governments that were not interested about the sanitation among the population.
Nobody took notice of this situation and nobody insisted that they should be on the field in uniform, not, on chairs in offices, the whole day. As a result, the daily inspection of homes, homesteads, lands, the urbanised areas, the eateries and catering services were abandoned. It became history and forgotten forever. Since then, we found blocked drains, pits filled with the water turned out to become breeding places for mosquitoes, worms and flies and stench emanating polluting the air. Food catering services became cesspools.
The result of this willful negligence over many decades bore fruit recently in the form of a catastrophe drawing the attention of the whole world.
The attempts so far taken from 2013 to eradicate dengue and the mosquito have failed and we have come across thousands of patients and deaths in the region of three hundred by now.
Keeping environment clean
This situation cannot be overcome by sending 5,000 youths around the country from the SLFP youth League as declared recently. This was done by the past regime too. These were suggestions from the wise guys and wiseacres to hoodwink the people who ruled. The rulers accommodated those impracticable suggestions to pacify their boot lickers. Those boys and girls and men and women had good fun going around the towns and villages at state expense, collected their allowances and left. It ended in one round. This time too, it happened as the youth league leaders declared and ended in one round similarly as it happened during the past regime.
There is no necessity to talk so much about keeping the environment clean. I presume both the right and the left side of the parliament have spoken several billions of words about doing this. Words of mouth cannot make a country clean. It’s only the intention and devoted work and concentration of the people led by the health workers could keep the country clean.
There is one remedy. It’s the only remedy. It’s the responsibility of a house holder to keep the home and the homestead clean. It is the responsibility of a trader to keep the trading centre and precincts clean. It’s the responsibility of the respective councils to keep the townships clean. It’s the responsibility of the Heads of Institutions to ensure that their departments are kept clean.
It’s the responsibility of the Regional Ministers –in – charge to see to it that these responsibilities are executed satisfactorily. It’s the responsibility of the Cabinet Minister of Health to oversee. For this purpose, he must have his delegates namely, the Public Health Inspectors, a punctilious team.
First of all, it must be understood that the function of the P.H.I. is not a sedentary one. It’s a job of work in the field, involving travelling and walking from house to house regularly and punctually.
The calibre of the P.H.I. is the important factor that has to be taken into consideration when recruitment is done. They must be well screened and their family backgrounds must be checked, as respectable people who believe in decorum – correctness of behaviour and dignity have to be recruited for this position as they are expected to mix with families. Many complaints were received during the past regime about arrogant and aggressive Public Health Inspectors who have been indecent and abusive when meeting with ladies in houses in the absence of their patriarchs. The recent example came on page 03 of the
Daily News of 15.07.2017 under the caption “Dengue Inspector attacked” with a knife. There couldn’t have been smoking without fire. A person who builds a harmonious understanding relationship with the people will not face a situation like this. Instead of being aggressive they must work with them in tandem.
A P.H.I. must be attached to each and every Grama Niladhari division. There are about 300 houses in a division or in the region of that number or more or even less, some times. There are five working days in a week for the public servants. According to this example, a P.H.I. must visit sixty houses a day and in the five day week, the individual will visit the 300 houses. This has to go on, on rotation for some time and later on in a zigzag. Going zigzag will enable the P.H.I. to detect or to identify the house holders who neglect maintenance or flout instructions. This rotation will take a Public Health Inspector to a house four times during a month and go zigzag will create surprise visits to keep the house holders awakened.
Regular inspections
During these visits the P.H.I. must handover to a house holder a booklet containing instructions to be followed in respect of keeping a house clean and maintaining an environment free from pollution with a record sheet to be hung in a distinctive place to enable the P.H.I. to record presence on inspection and remarks as well.
The Public Health Inspectors’ prime responsibility is to educate the residents and lead them to maintain their homes, homesteads and lands to sanitary standards. Regular inspections will make the householders and land owners to compulsorily attend to the maintenance of their residences and properties.
The success of this assignment depends on the rapport the Public Health Inspector maintains with the residents. This functionary must become a relative of the general public and maintain close and cordial relations with them who then becomes part and parcel of their daily life. This will facilitate the P.H.I. to lead them to lead a healthy life by education which every housewife will willingly accept. Imposition of fines and prosecution are only a persecution.
The successive governments and the people are responsible for this situation. Whilst the people’s responsibility is to maintain a healthy environment, simultaneously, it is the responsibility of the government to ensure that standards are maintained by the people. However, there is an excuse for both parties as this country was a hell on earth for thirty years during which three decades everything had to be given up unwillingly and unwittingly under the catastrophic circumstances. Therefore, the imposition of fines and prosecution at this moment is unjustifiable. It is seen as a persecution. Once the people are educated and if the educated people flout or neglect responsibilities enforcing the powers vested in the Public Health Inspectors or other authorities will be justifiable.
Many thousands of officers and their subordinates who were attached to the Anti-Malaria Campaign are not among the living today but, those who are among us will remember the humble work they did painstakingly walking through the length and breadth of the country engaging in all the nooks and corners undergoing trials and tribulations for more than seventy years. It’s because of their dedicated services that we are today free from Malaria. The certificate that Sri Lanka got from the World Health Organization to that effect is a tribute to them.
Dengue cannot be eliminated in a day or two. It’s a Herculean task. It’s only through a campaign similar to the Anti-Malaria Campaign we could anticipate an end.
