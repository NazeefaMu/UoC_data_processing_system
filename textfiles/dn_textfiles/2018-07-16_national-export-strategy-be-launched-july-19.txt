National Export Strategy  to be launched on July-19

The National Export Strategy (NES) is a fantastic opportunity for the private sector and the government to work together and the NES target is achievable, Harin De Silva, Chairman, Export Association of Sri Lanka (EASL) said.
Speaking to Daily News Business in the sidelines of the 21st EASL AGM in Colombo on Friday he said the government in collaboration with exporters has put together a fantastic document (NES) which will be launched on July 19. He however cautioned that the government should drive it and there should be a political will that comes from the top to execute the plan. “The private sector cannot get involved in running these things because we run our own businesses,” the EASL chief said.
“The success of this document will depend entirely on the political will of the incumbent government to drive the National Export Strategy,” he pointed out.
De Silva said the targets stipulated in the NES were achievable although it may not happen overnight. “With the necessary infrastructure behind the export fraternity in the next couple of years we can get there,” he asserted insisting that the exporters were also keen in having a clear direction to forge ahead with their export plans.
The EASL chairman emphasized five main points that could formulate the foundation for the growth in the Sri Lankan export sector. Among them were driving the NES. Here the government must ensure that a predictable transparent policy and regulatory framework was in place to promote the Sri Lankan export industry. He said the second point was improving the investment climate in Sri Lanka and the third addressing the constraints for market access promotion. De Silva added that the fourth point was the coactive engagement in trade liberalization and fifth point was fostering innovation driven exports.
The NES is a comprehensive and carefully structured five-year strategy aimed at increasing exports and generating enhanced revenue for Sri Lanka’s SMEs and exporters. The implementation of this endeavour is expected to increase Sri Lanka’s export revenue to US$ 28 billion by 2022.
