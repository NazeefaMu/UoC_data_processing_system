Over 15,000 children in A’pura district malnourished

Anuradhapura District Additional Secretary Saman Bandulasena at a recent District Agriculture Committee Meeting said a survey revealed that over 15,000 children in the Anuradhapura district had been affected by malnutrition. The District Agriculture Committee has decided to give priority to programmes of anti-alcoholism, anti malnutrition and prevention of kidney diseases as they influence the rural economy in the district. He said there are a minimum of 700 - 800 children affected by malnutrition in 22 Divisional Secretariat Divisions.
Bandulasena said it is necessary to take remedial measures to address the health hazard. A permanent dieting and feeding methodology will be implemented to enhance their weight and height, he said. "It was our target to decrease the malnutrition rate by 50 percent in 2017, the District Additional Secretary said. He said family health employees could play a significant role to reduce the number of malnutrition affected children".
Bandulasena said it has been decided to give priority to the families of the malnourished children in granting life supporting allowances and gratuities, milk cows and chicks.
He said the majority of kidney patients represent the rural farmer community belonging to low income group.
The District Agriculture Committee and all divisional level agriculture committees must be in close touch with the government and provincial council sponsored kidney prevention programmes.
