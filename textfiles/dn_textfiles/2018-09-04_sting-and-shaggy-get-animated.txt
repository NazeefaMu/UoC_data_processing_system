Sting and Shaggy get animated

Sting and Shaggy have been animated for a new music video based on Lewis Carroll’s poem ‘The Walrus and the Carpenter’.
In Just One Lifetime, the rocker and the reggae star’s cartoon lookalikes battle to save the earth with the characters from the 1871 poem.
The new track, which features lines from the popular narrative poetry piece, recited by Tweedledum and Tweedledee to Alice in the book Through the Looking Glass, is the follow-up to Sting and Shaggy’s Don’t Make Me Wait. Both songs feature on the new collection of “Caribbean-flavoured” tunes the pair has recorded. The album’s title, 44/876, references the international telephone country codes for Sting’s native U.K. and Shaggy’s Jamaica.
The duo teamed up in the studio late last year to record music together, and debuted Don’t Make Me Wait at a charity concert in Jamaica back in January 2018.
The studio version of the song was released in February, and more material from their studio sessions will follow, according to an announcement on Sting’s website.
Sting and Shaggy, real name Orville Richard Burrell, have just announced a joint North American tour, which will begin in Jacksonville, Florida on September 14. The pair just wrapped up a European concert series, where they teamed up to perform their biggest hits, like ‘Every Breath You Take’, ‘Message In A Bottle’, ‘It Wasn’t Me’, and ‘Mr. Boombastic’, together.
