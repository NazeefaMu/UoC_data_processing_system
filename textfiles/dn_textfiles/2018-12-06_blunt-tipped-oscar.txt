Blunt  tipped for  an Oscar

No need for a spoonful of sugar: first reports of Disney’s ‘Mary Poppins Returns’ suggests that audiences will eagerly gobble down the sequel.
Early critical buzz and audience reactions from the film’s Los Angeles premiere appeared online with the lifting of the social media embargo after the event.
The reactions have been largely positive. Journalist Nick Kazdan called ‘Mary Poppins Returns’ “enjoyable as heck and pays the original justice,” while screenwriter Gary Goldstein stated the film was “deserving of its standing ovation”.
Actor Josh Gad simply tweeted “believe the hype. Wow,” one of many effusive and emotional tweets about the film. In a sweetly charming stamp of approval, Blunt’s husband actor-director John Krasinski couldn’t stop crying throughout the film.
‘Mary Poppins Returns’ boasts a mixture of elements that could make it a surefire festive hit. The film’s cast of Emily Blunt, Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda, Colin Firth, Ben Whishaw, Emily Mortimer, Julie Walters and Meryl Streep suggest it could well be stuffed to the brim with top-notch performances.
The film will be released on December 21. The Telegraph
