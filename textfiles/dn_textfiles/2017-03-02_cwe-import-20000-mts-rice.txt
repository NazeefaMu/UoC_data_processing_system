CWE to import 20,000 MTs of rice

The Cooperative Wholesale Establishment (CWE) is to import 20,000 MT of rice to meet the present rice shortage and control the ever increasing price of rice.
Another 100,000 MT of raw and Nadu rice is to be imported by the CWE as a buffer stock through a government to government basis to meet the future shortages as the drought is expected to persist into the foreseeable future.
Earlier this year, the import duty of Rs. 51 was removed and a Special Commodity Levy (SCL) of Rs 15 was imposed for imported rice. By 25 January 22,000 MT of rice had been imported under the new scheme but importers had complained to the government that the SCL was too high and that made the landing cost of rice to be Rs 75 per kilo. Hence, it was further reduced to Rs 5 to bring costs between Rs 65-66 per kilo.
Rice price hikes have been one of the main concerns of the government as poor harvests last year and this has led to a major rice shortage in the country.
President Maithripala Sirisena earlier also imposed two separate control prices to keep in check the prices of imported and domestic rice.
According to the new controlled prices; Samba is Rs 90/kilo except for local Keeri samba and Suuduru Samba.
Imported Samba is at Rs 80/kg, local Nadu is Rs 80/kg, imported Nadu is Rs 72/kg, local Kekulu rice is at Rs 78/kg and imported Kekulu is at Rs 70 per kilo.
As of February 26 113,000 MT has been imported with a slight decrease in price but the government noted that there was still a shortage of rice stocks in the market.
The Treasury has been directed to issue a Treasury Gurantee of Rs 1.4 billion for importation of 20,000 MT every month and another for Rs 7 billion for the import of the buffer stock.
The imported rice will be sold through Lanka Sathosa outlets and the open market.
