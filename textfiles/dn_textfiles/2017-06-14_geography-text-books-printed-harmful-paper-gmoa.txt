Geography text books printed in harmful paper : GMOA

The Education Ministry has printed some school text books in paper harmful to the health of schoolchildren, Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoysa said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA head office yesterday, he said the Education Ministry has spent Rs.1,500 million and printed half a million geography text books for students in grade seven.
Dr. De Zoysa said state scientific research and standards bodies had stated in their reports that eye and respiratory diseases develop in schoolchildren by using these books.
The books (made out of artificial material) cannot be recommended for students below 12 years for regular use.
Acetophenone, Benzaldehyde, Benzophenone, Benzyl Alcohol and Butylated Hydroxytoluene are some of the poisonous chemicals used to produce these books.
The GMOA will inform the President in writing to remove these school text books and punish those who ignored recommendations made by the Finance Ministry, state bodies and other state scientific institutions, Dr. De Zoysa said.
