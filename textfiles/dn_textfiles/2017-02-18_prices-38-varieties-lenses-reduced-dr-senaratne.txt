Prices of 38 varieties of lenses reduced: Dr Senaratne

The prices of 38 varieties of eye lenses (involving 38 private companies) have been regulated and as a result the prices have been reduced in large scales, offering a huge relief to the people. The price of the entire package of eye lens has been reduced. Accordingly, it is expected that the prices of eye surgeries too will go down, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Addressing a press conference held at the Health Ministry Auditorium yesterday, Minister Dr. Senaratne said that prices have been reduced from Rs. 26,900 to Rs. 17,000, from Rs. 25,900 to Rs. 16,400, from Rs. 28,000 to Rs. 16,200, from 25,900 to Rs. 15,500, from Rs. 25,000 to Rs. 15,500, from Rs. 25,000 to Rs. 12,100, etc. The full price reduction list is available in a Gazette Notification and would be published through media for the benefit of the public. The prices were regulated with the participation of all stake holders.
According to Minister Dr. Senaratne, arrangements would be made to regulate the prices of the rest of the drugs, medical devices, private hospitals, all laboratory tests in the private sector, etc for the benefit of the people. Health is not only a profit making business, it is a service. Various problems had occurred when the decades long procedure changed. It is unavoidable. But the people were benefited.
Minister Dr. Senaratne pointed out that various internal and external pressures were put on him when he reduced the prices of 48 drugs and it was same when the prices of eye lenses was reduced. Ambassadors came and discussed. But the prices were reduced according to the policy of the good governance offering relief to the people.
The policy of the Government belongs to the youths of the country who formulated it. President Sirisena and myself did not have supporters before January 08, 2015. President Sirisena was very straight forward when it comes to handling issues of increasing the tax on tobacco and stated that the Tobacco Company can close its operations in Sri Lanka and leave if they wish to do so, he added.
