Defence Discipline with fun drills thrills and spills

We have already discussed the importance of introducing children to the martial arts and how the discipline can help calm and focus young minds while teaching them important skills. Yet one may wonder what courtesy has to do with martial arts. To many the two disciplines may seem totally opposed to each other. The term martial arts conjures up visions of combatants going at each other with a flurry of punches, kicks and lethal strikes aimed principally at demolishing an opponent.
True, but that is an image mostly projected by many action movies that provide conflict buffs with high-octane entertainment. Some parents are concerned that teaching kids martial arts may make them violent, but the reverse is actually true. Studies have found that some form of such training actually made them less violent than their peers.
The most important benefi
It’s true that the word ‘martial’ is related to war and fighting. But as a sport, martial arts offer kids an excellent opportunity to learn athletic skills, self-defence, respect, and self-discipline. They also learn when and where kicking, punching, and wrestling are appropriate. And equally important they learn where not to.
Activities such as tae kwon do, kung fu and aikido are a fun way for both boys and girls to achieve fitness and focus. Some parents may think they also promote violence, but that’s a myth, according to experts. The martial arts actually help teach self-discipline and socialisation skills. In fact, many parents whose children have attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) report great success with these programs because self-control and concentration are exactly the skills underdeveloped in ADHD kids.
A typical hour-long class begins and ends with a bow to the teacher, or master. After a warm-up, students practice the art’s particular skills, which may include kicks, punches and blocks. Each requires concentration and strict attention.
With children it is much more important to emphasise the need for self defence only. An adult understands when it is appropriate to use martial arts skills. With children, you really need to stress that it is not ok to solve our problems with force. If this comes from a positive role model, children take it to heart.
Progress is often marked by the belt system, which takes the beginner from a white belt through a variety of colours until black. Testing for each new level, generally every three months, is a good exercise in setting and achieving goals.
But, say experts, it’s the respect kids learn, whether from bowing or standing still and waiting for the next command, that can be the most important benefit: It often carries over into school, helping to improve behaviour and even grades, according to recent research.
The right type of humility
Whether a child is punching a pad or breaking a board, he or she must be incredibly focused on the action. When a child learns to concentrate energy on the task at hand this same focus can be applied to schoolwork assignments.
Another significant aspect is effort. Students are always being hard-pressed to give 100 per cent of endeavour on a consistent basis. Students are unfailingly encouraged to kick a little higher or punch a little faster or with more power at every training session. This motivates them to never accept less from themselves and makes them realise their true potential. It also teaches children that they can be far better than average when it comes to achieving higher academic grades.
Most instructors tend to be extremely strict when it comes to behaviour in dojo classes. They will not tolerate excessive jabbering or horsing around in the dojo. Improved behaviour in martial arts classes often translates into improved behaviour at school, which in turn enhances grades.
Courteousness demonstrates that you have what it takes to be a leader and shows you have self-control. It also exhibits the fact that you possess the right type of humility and want to avoid confrontation. Remember that most punch ups start with words. Courtesy and elegant behaviour is your first line of defence.
Conventional martial arts, in their varied forms, teaches you to show consideration to others. And it’s not just towards your teachers or fellow students, but everybody you meet and interact with in your day to day life. In a traditional martial arts school courtesy is not an option. It is the norm.
A variety of different ways
Anyone wanting to learn the skills of codified systems and traditions of combat practices should first learn to be courteous. And when you train in an environment that demands courtesy and mutual respect, you are bound to develop those qualities to even higher standards of excellence and practice them in your daily life.
Yes, and the discipline is appropriate for kids with special needs as well. Children with attention deficits may find a new sense of focus in martial arts. With its emphasis on balance, coordination, concentration, and flexibility, kids’ martial arts can be beneficial for children with a variety of physical, emotional, or cognitive challenges.
The reason children gravitate towards the martial arts is that they are seeking a route to self-empowerment in a frightening world. The children want to be strong, capable, and physically coordinated. They also want to become, in a very real sense, the hero of their own story.
What you should look for is a teacher that ignites that passion in the children, and then keeps consistently high expectations for focused effort and hard work, while also modelling and embodying the deeper philosophy of good martial arts practice.
The ability to defend oneself against an assailant is an empowering feeling. Most martial arts disciplines use self defence as a cornerstone of the entire program.
The precise methods will vary from discipline to discipline, but you can be certain that with regular practice, your children will learn to defend themselves in a variety of different ways. Many martial arts schools also teach street-smart techniques to kids to help avoid problems altogether.
As students become stronger physically and they begin to realise they can handle themselves in dangerous situations, they become more confident individuals overall. A heightened sense of self confidence will certainly benefit children throughout their lives. So never be impartial to the marvel of the courteous arts that are martial.
