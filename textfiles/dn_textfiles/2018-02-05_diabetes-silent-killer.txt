Diabetes -the silent killer

Consultant Clinical and Interventional Cardiologist, Dr. Mohan Jayatilake (MD, MRCP) speaks to Daily News about diabetes and heart health this week.
Q - What is the impact of Diabetes on the heart?
A - Brief introduction about diabetes is essential to know about its cardiac complications. Diabetes is a disease in which your blood sugar levels are too high. Insulin hormone in the body helps to control blood sugar level. With type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin, which is commonly seen in children, teens and young adults. In type 2 diabetes the more common type in adulthood, body does not use insulin well (insulin resistance). Over the time, diabetes can damage your blood vessels and the nerves that control heart and blood vessels. Therefore cholesterol deposits in coronary arteries in the heart (Atherosclerosis) may lead to heart attacks. Same mechanism in brain (Cerebral) arteries can lead to “strokes”.
In adults with diabetes, most common causes of death is heart attacks and strokes. Heart attack is 3-5 times more common with diabetes and is the leading cause of death in type 2 diabetes. Another relatively common complication is enlarged heart with poor heart function (heart failure) due to cardiac muscle involvement in type 2 diabetes known as “Congestive Cardiomyopathy”.
Dr. Mohan Jayatilake
Absolute risk of cardiac disease is lower in type 1 diabetes. Increased risk of heart attacks and heart failure in type 2 diabetes is due to combination of hyperlipidemia. (High cholesterol and high triglycerides), smoking, high blood pressure, obesity and belly fat around the waist, lack of exercises and family history of heart diseases.
Pre-menopausal women who normally have lower rates of coronary artery disease due to estrogen hormone lose this protection once diabetes develops.
Q – What are the symptoms of diabetes and what is the most vulnerable age group?
A- Diabetes is commonly genetically determined and run in the family members. Therefore diabetes may be diagnosed in the young and adults for the first time with the symptoms of increased thirst and hunger, increase urination, blurred vision, unusual weight loss. However cardiac symptoms due to coronary artery clogging with cholesterol deposits and thrombosis might take a long time. For some people when the first heart attack occurs it shows a very high sugar level for the first time. Therefore, there is no time period or age limit for the diabetes symptoms to develop.
Heart diseases can be minimized by optimal blood sugar control. Diabetes is commonly associated with other risk factors for heart diseases, such as high blood pressure, high LDL cholesterol levels, high triglycerides in blood, obesity and family history of heart diseases.
Prevention and treatment of these risk factors especially lowering LDL cholesterol level than 100mg per dl. (2.6 mmol/L) will be beneficial for the diabetic patient to lower the incidents of heart diseases. Reducing the blood pressure to 130/80 will further reduce the cardiac events in diabetes.
Q - What are the medical tests that should be done by a diabetes patient to make sure that he/she is not suffering from any heart diseases/complication?
1. Blood sugar estimation
- Diabetes should be under strict control with frequent random blood sugar level estimations. Preferably monitoring at home with glucometer is advised. For majority of healthy people normal blood sugar levels are as follows,
Between 72- 108 mg /dl (4-6 mmol / L) when fasting. Up to 140 mg / dl (7-8 mmol/L) 2 hours after meals.
High blood sugar levels consistently above 240mg /dl can be more dangerous, and can lead tosemi-conscious state, coma or death.
2. Cholesterol estimation in blood
- (Lipid profile) at least every six months. Preferably LDL cholesterol levels (Bad cholesterol) should be less than 100mg/dl, HDL cholesterol (Good cholesterol) should be more than 40mg/dl and triglyceride should be less than 150mg/dl to minimize heart disease in diabetic patients.
3. HbA1c blood levels
This refers to glycated hemoglobin. By measuring this, one can get overall picture of average blood sugar levels over a period of 3 months. The higher the HbA1c, the greater the risk of developing diabetes related heart diseases and other complications. Target HbA1c for diabetes is 6.5 per cent (48mmol/mol).
Research has shown that people with type 2 diabetes who reduced their HbA1c level by 1 per cent are 16 per cent less likely to suffer from heart diseases.
4. Echocardiogram
This test is an ultra sound scan of heart. It gives an image of heart and functioning capacity of heart as ejection fraction (EF). In heart failure heart is enlarged and EF is significantly reduced below 50 per cent. This is medically treatable condition for long time survival of patient. If abnormality is detected, annual echo cardiogram test is recommended.
5. Resting ECG
Resting ECG should be done in every diabetic patient. This may be normal in majority of patients even with heart disease. ECG may be abnormal in silent heart attacks and heart failures when having diabetes.
6. Exercise ECG (Treadmill stress test)
If resting ECG does not show acute changes of heart attacks exercise ECG is recommended. The exercise ECG test reveals whether it is negative (good) or positive (bad). If it is negative coronary artery disease is unlikely. If it is positive with ECG changes and symptoms of angina, coronary artery disease is very likely. If stress test is negative in a diabetic patient, every two years stress test is recommended or whenever he gets angina symptoms stress test need to be done.
7. Coronary Angiogram
Coronary angiogram is the next step of diagnosis if stress test becomes positive. This is a test which gives dye (contrast) through an artery in the arm or the leg to coronary arteries to detect the blockages if any. If so, balloon angioplasty with stent implantation or bypass surgery is recommended.
If angiogram is normal, patient is diagnosed to be having normal coronary arteries. This is not a screening test for diabetes patients who do not have cardiac symptoms. But some people prefer to have CT coronary angiogram as a screening test to evaluate coronary arteries.
8. Other tests
a) High sensitivity C- reactive protein (hsCRP) levels will be useful to determine risk of coronary artery diseases.
b) High Level of calcium score estimated with CT angiogram will also be useful to determine risk of coronary artery diseases.
Q - Are there any precautions or concerns when a diabetes patient has to undergo a heart surgery?
A - Management of blood glucose levels in the pre-operative setting is important in diabetic patients. That will reduce morbidity and mortality and improve surgical outcomes especially coronary artery bypass surgery, valve replacement surgery, heart transplantation and implantation of ventricular assist devices in heart failure patients where heart surgeries are concerned. For all those blood glucose control is essential pre-operatively and post-operatively to avoid further complications. Surgical wound healing is also impaired when blood sugar levels are not very controlled. Usually insulin administration is performed in all these situations.
Q – What is a ` silent heart attack’?
A- Heart attacks do not always have obvious symptoms such as chest pain, breathlessness and cold sweats. In fact Heart attacks can happen without a person knowing it. It is called silent heart attacks.
Some people present with fatigue and problems related to heart a few weeks back may have non specific or subtle symptoms such as indigestion or a case of “flu”.
This is usually seen in long standing diabetic patients or very elderly people. In this situation also blood flow is blocked in a coronary artery by cholesterol plaques. Risk factors are also the same.
Silent heart attacks are more common in women than in men. Silent heart attacks can be just as dangerous as its more obvious counterpart because it causes damage to heart muscles as patient did not know to seek treatment and no medication was taken, so the impact could potentially be greater.
Treatment is as same as, painful heart attacks, just to establish blood flow to the damaged muscle after doing an angiogram even though diagnosis was too late. However heart failure is the common result of this category as treatment is not given at the correct time.
To prevent silent heart attacks
Be aware of your risk factors such as blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, regular exercise and avoid smoking to decrease the risk of heart attacks.
Silent heart attacks can even cause sudden death in some individuals.
Regular consultation of your doctor with cardiac screening, correct diagnosis in time, and strict control of diabetes over the time with risk factor reductions and proper treatment of heart diseases will certainly prevent or reduce the incidents of silent heart attacks.
