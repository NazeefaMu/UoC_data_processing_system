SAITM reiterates its legitimacy

The Management of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) in a statement would like to inform the general public of Sri Lanka and reiterated their legitimacy following the media statements that are currently circulated through the Department of Government Information.
The SAITM statement: "SAITM was established as a Degree Awarding Institute in terms of Section 25A of the Universities Act of 1978 and is recognised by the University Grants Commission (UGC) and the Ministry of Higher Education (MoHE).
“SAITM was established with the aim of providing quality private medical education in the country to augment the requirement of quality doctors to serve the people of the nation.
“Among the matters of concern arising from the said proposals are issues concerning graduates, students, parents and the staff of SAITM. “Therefore, these proposals need to be discussed at length with all stakeholders to ensure that justice to concerned parties are met. Going forward, we hope that SAITM graduates will be given provisional registration, subject to court proceedings and the current students’ education will continue without any disruption to their studies.
“We also note positively, the vision of SAITM’s founder Dr.Neville Fernando’s to produce quality non state doctors will continue despite enormous opposition from various political and other parties with vested interests”.
