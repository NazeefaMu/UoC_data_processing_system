Spreading the word of Krishna

Most people are eager to achieve money or fame. But without expecting anything in the age of 70, Bhakti Vedantha Swami Prabhupada accomplished a great record.
Swami Prabhupada was born in 1896 and met his spiritual Master (Guru) Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswathi Goswami in 1922 at the age of 26. The Guru liked this educated young man and convinced him to dedicate his life to teaching Vedic knowledge in the Western world. Srila Prabhupada became his student, and 11 years later (1933) at Allahabad, he became his formally initiated disciple.
Recognizing Srila Prabhupada’s philosophical learning and devotion, the Gaudiya Vaisnava Society honoured him in 1947 with the title “Bhaktivedanta”. Bhakti-vedanta meaning “one who has realized that devotional service to the Supreme Lord is the end of all knowledge.”
In 1950, at the age of 44, Srila Prabhupada retired from married life, and four years later he adopted the vanaprastha (retired) order to devote more time to his studies and writing.
Srila Prabhupada traveled to the holy city of Vrndavana, where he lived in very humble circumstances in the historic medieval temple of Radha-Damodara. There he engaged for several years in deep study and writing. He accepted the renounced order of life sannyasa in 1959. At Radha-Damodara, Srila Prabhupada began work on his life’s masterpiece, a multivolume translation and commentary on the 18,000-verse Srimad-Bhagavatam (Bhagavata Purana).
Publications
He has written over 60 volumes of authoritative translations, commentaries and summary studies of the philosophical and religious classics of India.
In 1944, (from his front room at Sita Kanta Banerjee, Calcutta), he started the publication called ‘Back to Godhead’, for which he acted as writer, designer, publisher, editor, copy editor and distributor. He personally designed the logo. His well known name, Prabhupada, is a Sanskrit title, literally meaning “He who has taken the shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord” where prabhu denotes “Lord” and pada means “taking shelter.”
From 1950, he lived at the medieval Radha-Damodar mandir in the holy town of Vrindavan, where he began his commentary and translation work of the Sanskrit works Bhagavata Purana. His guru, Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati, had always encouraged him that “If you ever get money, print books”, referring to the need of literary presentation of the Vaishnava culture. Sri Roopa Gaudiya Matha Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh was the place where Prabhupada used to live, he had written and studied in the library of this building, and here he edited the ‘Gauiya Patrika’ magazine.
Time was moving fast. Swami Prabhupada was achieving the age of 70. It could be the right time swami Prabhupada to accomplish the command of the Guru. So Prabhupada was trying to go to America to spread the knowledge of Krishna Conscious to the English speaking world.
A shipping company owner Sumathy Morarji was a devotee of Lord Krishna and she was well known to swami Prabhupada. Swami Prabhupada approached her and requested her help to go to America.
Sumathi Morarji was able to do any help to Swami Prabhupada but as he was very old she thought it will not be suitable for him to travel to America.
She said ‘No. You are not healthy. It would be too cold there. You might not be able to come back’, and she doubted whether he would be able to accomplish much there. People in America were not so cooperative, and they would probably not listen to him.
Sumati Morarji was concerned. “Swamiji, you are so old. You are taking this responsibility. Do you think it is all right?”
He reassured her, lifting his hand as if to reassure a doubting daughter, “it is all right.”
“But do you know what my secretaries think? They say, “Swamiji is going to die there.’”
Swami Prabhupada made a face as if to dismiss a foolish rumor. Again he insisted that she give him a ticket.
“All right,” she said. “I will make an arrangement to send you by our ship.” Swami smiled brilliantly and happily left her offices, past her amazed and skeptical clerks.
He then left India, obtaining free passage on a freight ship called the ‘Jaladuta’, with the aim and a hope of fulfilling his spiritual master’s instruction to spread the message of Krishna Conscious around the world. In his possession were a suitcase, an umbrella, a supply of dry cereal, about eight dollars worth of Indian currency forty Rupees and several boxes of books.
Voyage
During this voyage swami Prabhupada landed in Sri Lanka on August 19, 1965. The Sri Lankan branch of ISKCON is celebrating his visit of 50 years.
Swami Prabhupada mentioned in his Diary about his arrival in Sri Lanka as follows;
‘The next morning 19/08/65 I informed my situation to Captain Pandia and he was very kind to take me to the shore in a motor launch. We dropped at Elizabeth gate talked with some Ceylonese clerks and then in a taxi we went to the office of Narottam & Pierera Co. The manager Banka was a Gujarati gentleman and he received us well. He arranged for me a good car to go around the city.
The office quarter was quite busy and many foreign offices and renowned banks were there. I saw the Governor General’s house, the Parliament House, the Town Hall (and) one very nice sea-side Hotel and passed through very nice clean roads, bazaars. The city appeared to be nice and clean, and the small bungalows nicely decorated. The city is quite up to resembling an Indian city like Madras and Poona. The busses and taxis were clean to see. The bus stands almost crowded like that of the Indian cities. The offices conducted almost in Indian style. The culture and civilization is Indian… but artificially India and Ceylon is divided. We start for Cochin at 6 p.m.’
By journeying to USA, he was attempting to fulfill the wish of his guru, possible only by the grace of “His dear Lord Krishna”.
The journey proved to be treacherous. During the arduous forty-day sea journey the ship met heavy storms. For two consecutive nights, he had severe heart attacks which almost killed him. On the third night, Lord Krishna appeared to Srila Prabhupada in a dream. The Supreme Lord Himself was pulling the ship to America, encouraging Srila Prabhupada and giving him all protection. Srila Prabhupada penned this prayer upon reaching New York City.
When he sailed to the United States in 1965, his trip was not sponsored by any religious organization, nor was he met upon arrival by a group of loyal followers. As the Indian freighter Jaladuta neared his destination.
On 13 September he wrote in his diary: ‘Oh my Lord Krishna, I do not know why you have brought me here. Now you can do whatever you like with me. But I guess you have some business here, otherwise why would you bring me to this terrible place? How will I make them understand this message of Krishna consciousness? I am very unfortunate, unqualified and most fallen. Therefore, I am seeking your benediction so that I can convince them, for I am powerless to do so on my own’.
He then sat under a tree in a park in New York City, played on some small hand cymbals, and sang the Hare Krishna mantra:
‘Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. ‘
Surprisingly, some young people walked over, sat down, and joined in with this strange chant. They listened with interest when he spoke of yoga and of how meditation could take them to a higher level of consciousness. With the help of students, Bhaktivedanta Swami rented a small storefront on New York’s Lower East Side to use as a temple.
Later, in a small shop in front of the Temple some people watched, fascinated, as he performed the traditional arati ceremony with incense, bells and lamps, and followed him as he showed them how to chant the mantra using wooden beads. He even cooked vegetarian meals for them, with delicious, exotic-sounding names; dahl, subji, chapatti, pakorah, samosa, halavah, laddhu and gulabjamon.
The young people had never experienced anything like this before. Gradually he taught them how to live a good and simple life, free from bad habits and confusing ideas.
In July of 1966, Bhaktivedanta Swami established the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON). Under Srila Prabhupada’s pure guidance the Krishna consciousness movement quickly flourished. Within months ISKCON Radha-Krishna temples opened in New York, San Francisco, Boston, Los Angeles, and Montreal.
Tours
After a group of devotees and a temple had been established in New York another center was started in San Francisco in 1967. From there he traveled throughout America with his disciples, popularizing the movement through street chanting (sankirtana), book distribution and public speeches. One of 108 worldwide temples he opened by 1977, was dedicated to Krishna-Balarama.
Once ISKCON was more established in the USA a small number of devotees from the San Francisco temple were sent to London, England. By the time of his death in Vrindavan in 1977, ISKCON had become an internationally known expression of Vaishnavism. In the 12 years from his arrival in New York until his final days, he circled the globe 14 times on lecture tours that took him to six continents. He also directed the founding of the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, which claims to be the world’s largest publisher of ancient and classical Vaishnava religious texts and he founded the religious colony New Vrindavan in West Virginia.
He authored over 80 books (with many available online on Vedantic philosophy, religion, literature and culture including four published originally in Bengali). He introduced international celebrations in the capitals of the world such as Jagannatha processions. According to the most recent issue of Back to Godhead magazine, founded by Prabhupada, there are at present, over 400 temples and farm communities listed to visit.
The Sri Lankan branch of ISKCON Sri Radhakrishna Temple was opened in 1976. At present, they are constructing a new large temple for Lord Vishnu at 188, Newchetty Street, Colombo 13.
