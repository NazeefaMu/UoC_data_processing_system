New wing for fever patients at Teldeniya hospital

Teldeniya District Base Hospital will open a new wing for fever patients from next week at Outpatient Department, employing a nurse and two Medical Health Officers to identify dengue affected patients to provide proper medical treatment without delay, said Medical Superintendent Officer at Teldeniya District Base Hospital Dr Chaminda Weerakoon. The purpose of opening this new wing is to distinguish patients who should be treated outdoor or indoor.
He said most of the dengue patients come to the hospital for admission directly after undergoing NS 1 test whereas most of those cases can be treated at OPD level.
Dr. Chaminda said the new wing will help patients undergo full blood tests and the report will be provided to them within one hour. “If the patient’s platelets count is between 150,000 and 130,000, the patient can be treated at OPD level. If not, it is advised to undergo indoor treatment,” he said. Most dengue patients were reported at Teldeniya District Base Hospital from Teldeniya a few months ago.
At present, many come from Kundasale and a few come from Udadumbara.
