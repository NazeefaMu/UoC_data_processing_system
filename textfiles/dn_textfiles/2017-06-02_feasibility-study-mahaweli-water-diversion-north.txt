The government with Asian Development Bank assistance has initiated a feasibility study on the diversion of Mahaweli Water to Northern Province planned to be implemented with the completion of the Moragahakanda – Kalu ganga project, Mahaweli Development and Agriculture Ministry Secretary Udaya R. Seneviratne said.
The secretary said work on the Moragahakanda dam has been completed. Construction of the Kalu Ganga reservoir will be completed by the year end, he said. A massive development will take place in the Northern, North Central, Eastern and North Western provinces by taking water to those areas through the project, Seneviratne said. Twenty five megawatts of electricity will be generated, he said.
The government will also establish a new development zone of 85,000 hectares, he said.
