Ceylinco Life takes doctors, medicines to 1,000 flood victims

A thousand people affected by the recent floods in the Southern Province have been provided with free medical consultations and medicines at medical camps organised by Ceylinco Life.
Using the expertise and facilities accumulated by the company for its ‘Waidya Hamuwa’ programme – a corporate social responsibility initiative that has been in operation for 10 years – Ceylinco Life conducted three special medical camps in June for flood victims.
These camps resulted in doctors, nurses, medical assistants and pharmacists offering their services free of charge to 356 residents of Akuressa, 368 residents of Neluwa and 256 people from Kamburupitiya at Athureliya MahaVidyalaya, Batuwangala Purana Raja Maha Viharaya and the SinipellaBodiyanganaramaya Temple respectively.
All participants were screened for possible infections and diseases which are common after such natural disasters and were educated on how to protect themselves from such infections in addition to being provided with the medications they needed, the company said.
Funded under Ceylinco Life’s extensive portfolio of CSR initiatives, the regular Waidya Hamuwa programme is carried out by a team of doctors, medical and ophthalmic technicians and nurses that travels across the country, offering communities the facility of free consultancy and diagnostic checks. The programme had benefitted more than 125,000 people by the end of 2016.
Attendees receive a free examination by a doctor and undergo necessary diagnostic tests such as random blood sugar, ECG and blood pressure. They also receive eye checks free of charge. These gatherings are used by Ceylinco Life to educate attendees on cancer and diabetes using video clips and other modes of communication. Ceylinco life had also built and donated classroom buildings to 66 schools under its CSR agenda by end 2016 and has donated essential equipment and infrastructure to several hospitals.
The company defines its Corporate Social Responsibility as ‘The continuing commitment of the company to create a sustainable business environment even in the remotest areas of the country through meaningful interventions in areas such as healthcare and education for needy people, while providing protection and financial security of the highest quality.”
