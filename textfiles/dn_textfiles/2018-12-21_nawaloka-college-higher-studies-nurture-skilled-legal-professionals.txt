Nawaloka College of Higher Studies to nurture skilled legal professionals

Further strengthening its leadership in the Sri Lankan tertiary education, Nawaloka College of Higher Studies (NCHS) announced its partnership with the Ulster University in the United Kingdom to commence an LLB degree transfer program to offer a pathway to their internationally recognized Bachelor in Law (LLB) degree final year.
This strategic collaboration paves a path for local students to complete a law degree from a leading university in the United Kingdom at a fraction of the cost of studying overseas.
Dr. Jayantha Dharmadasa, Chairman of Nawaloka College of Higher Studies, Victor Ramanan, Deputy Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Nawaloka College of Higher Studies, Professor Paul Carmichael, Associate Dean (Global Engagement) Faculty of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences of Ulster University, Rob Low, Country Examinations Director- British Council, Sri Lanka and Dr. Dayanath Jayasooriya, Senior Academic Advisor of Nawaloka College of Higher Studies attended the launch event, which took place at the Nawaloka Hospital Auditorium, amongst a host of corporate luminaries from Nawaloka College of Higher Studies, Ulster University and the British Council.
Students with Advanced Level qualifications or Students who have sat for the London A/Levels this year can apply and join the prestigious LLB Law Degree programme, which is a ‘2+1 Degree Transfer programme’, starting from February 2019. Expressing his views of this new partnership, Dr. Jayantha Dharmadasa, Chairman of Nawaloka College of Higher Studies said, “The demand for professionals with a thorough knowledge in legal practices is on the rise; both globally and locally.
I firmly believe this partnership will enable us to provide sound academic guidance to Sri Lankan students. University of Ulster curriculum is well designed to bring out the best in students and it is the perfect platform for local undergraduates to nurture their skills to shine in their legal careers.”
“Our commitment to provide and facilitate quality education at an affordable cost to Sri Lankan students is unwavering. Collaborating with one of the highly rated UK law schools to introduce an LLB Degree programme was another step taken forward in our journey to become Sri Lanka’s leading higher education provider,” said Victor Ramanan, Deputy Chairman/ Chief Executive Officer of Nawaloka College of Higher Studies.
Ulster University provides an inspiring, engaging and intellectually stimulating environment for students of law at the undergraduate, post-graduate and CPD level. Research emerging from the School of Law is both pioneering and world-leading, with results from the UK National Exercise (REF) assessing their research as fourth overall in the UK, eclipsing the results of larger and more established law schools.
Commenting about the quality of the degree programme, Dr. Dayanath Jayasooriya, Senior Academic Advisor NCHS Law School, said, “We are much honoured to collaborate with the Ulster University, which has a prestigious history of producing excellent legal professionals for many years.”
