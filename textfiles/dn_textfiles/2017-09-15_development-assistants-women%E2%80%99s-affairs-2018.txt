Development Assistants on Women’s Affairs from 2018

Development Assistants on Women's Affairs will be appointed for all Divisional Secretariats from 2018, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
He was addressing the meeting of GS Officers and Development Officers at Temple Trees, yesterday.
The absence of proper planning of women's affairs at the grassroots level is essential. It should be addressed immediately to meet future objectives of the government on women's affairs.
The Premier said the women in Sri Lanka are over 52 percent of the population. However, there is still no proper plan for addressing women's issues at district and divisional level.
The government has already taken a decision to enhance female participation in local government bodies from 25 percent to 100 percent.
“There should be a grassroots level mechanism to encourage and make women aware of this to achieve aims. Therefore, the National Policies and Economic Affairs Ministry has taken the decision to appoint Development Assistants on Women's Affairs with the assistant of Child and Women's Affairs Ministry and the Home Affairs Ministry,” said the Prime Minister. “These officers are required to undergo two to three weeks training before recruiting them. Special training on women's affairs will also be conducted for Divisional Secretaries. We hope to introduce this mechanism at the district level as well,” said the Premier. During the party leaders’ meeting, party leaders requested the Elections Commission Chairman to hold Local Government elections soon after ending the Budget debate. We hope that elections would be held in January, he added.
Once new members are elected to Local Government bodies, we will be able to work with female representatives and work for the betterment of women. We are currently discussing with the Finance Ministry to include some programmes on women’s affairs in the Budget proposals. By doing that, we would be able to achieve the basic goals of the government with regard to women’s affairs, the Premier said.
