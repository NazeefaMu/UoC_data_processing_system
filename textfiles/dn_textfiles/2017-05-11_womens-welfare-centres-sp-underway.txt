Women's welfare centres for SP underway

Southern Provincial Rural Development Ministry has initiated measures to set up women's welfare centres in the region
Under the proposed programme, a women's welfare centre was already opened in the Divisional Secretariat Division of Hakmana. Female residents in the Hakmana DS Division are being selected for vocational training.
According to project officials, those selected would be provided with training in food-processing technology, sewing, tailoring, beauty culture, production of ornamental items and manufacturing of women's footwear. The duration allotted to each training course is one year.
All these training courses are free and they are to be conducted under the supervision of the Hakmana Divisional Secretariat Office.
Southern Provincial Rural Development Ministry is funding the programme.
