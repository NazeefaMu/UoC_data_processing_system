SLFP Convention brought minority  parties in to our platform: Amaraweera

The 66th SLFP Party Convention which brought many of the minority parties on to its platform, is very hopeful that they would support its candidate at a future Presidential election. UPFA General Secretary and Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, Mahinda Amaraweera addressing the weekly SLFP media briefing yesterday challenged any other majority party to be able to do the same,
“We saw Sumanthiran from the TNA with Doughlas Devananda of the EPDP, then we had hill country parties of Digambaram and Mano Ganesan. We also had Rauf Hakeem of the SLMC and representatives of the ACMC,” Minister Amaraweera said.
He went on to add, “It is only President Maithripala Sirisena who has been able to do so. These parties have said that the Convention had renewed their trust in President Sirisena,”
If we are to win an election, we could not do so without the support of these parties, explained Minister Amaraweera further, as the SLFP under President Sirisena has tried hard to win the confidence of the minorities which it lost during the previous regime.
The 66th Convention held on September 3, the Minister said, was a harbinger of the support the President and the SLFP enjoyed in the country, adding that it was more successful than any of the previous Conventions they have had so far.
Members of the Central Committee and the MPs had met President Sirisena on Wednesday evening to discuss the future action of the party in the aftermath of the Convention, said Amaraweera. Those gathered had decided to target party supporters at grassroot level.
“At village level, we have noticed that we were enjoying much support. Despite whatever the Joint Opposition says, the average SLFPer at the grassroot level is with the Party and President. Thus, we have decided to concentrate our efforts there,” he said.
Commenting on reports that certain SLFPers were set to leave the government, the Minister said that he was unaware of such a move and that the Joint Opposition has been playing the same tune for some time now with no discernible results to show.
