Moratuwites  down memory lane

The Moratuwa Arts Forum took the grand audience down memory lane for the 18th consecutive year in Koralawella. The background music was provided by Nalin and the Star Combination.
The event was held under the patronage of Kapila Ariyaratne. The singing eve commenced with the famous plantation song ‘Way Down upon the Suwannee River’ with the cowboy hits and classical English songs following suit. The songs mixed with famous evergreen Sinhala notes as well so that the audience could twist in singing to their own taste!
The first ever sing-a-long organized by the Moratuwites through the Moratuwa Arts Forum has now turned out to be a delicacy for all schools/associations. The event accommodated many raffle draws
The proceedings of the event will be utilized for financial aid for less privileged children. The proceedings of the previous ceremony have also been channelled to assist financially challenged schoolchildren. Veteran artiste Lucky Deva turned the pages of evergreens into a different vogue.
