‘Lanka will be self-sufficient in salt by 2020’

Lanka Salt Limited chairman Ayub Khan said Sri Lanka will have adequate stocks of salt for the country by 2020.
He was adressing a staff meeting held at the company recently.
The chairman said new salt fields were prepared at the Hambantota, Bundala, and Palatupana salterns. Old machinery and equipment were replaced with new ones and the extent of the salterns was increased to 2,600 acres, he said.
The chairman said the new management board in last year March found that the salt had been sold at loss. They appointed agents island-wide and increased the salt prices to cover the loss. He said 66 agents distribute salt island-wide at present.
“The total consumption of salt in the island is 1,50,000 MT and 120,000 MT is used for domestic needs while the rest is taken for industrial use. By October 2017, the salt harvest will be 85,000 MT and by 2018, it will increase up to 1,1000 MT,” he said.
