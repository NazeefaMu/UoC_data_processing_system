DPMC goes full throttle at Colombo Motor Show 2017

Motorcycle enthusiast got a rare treat at David Pieris Motor Company (DPMC) lounge during the Colombo Motor show 2017.
On display was the widest array of bikes from the Bajaj, from Dominar 400, Avenger Street Cruiser and the Bajaj V premium commuter to the performance packed Bajaj Pulsar range.
The highlight of this year's DPMC lounge was the introduction of the new Avenger 220 Cruise.
This newly introduced motorcycle is practically inaudible and the finishing with uncanny smoothness to create a truly tranquil ride. Featuring the highway comfort handle bar, 220cc DTS-i engine, oil cooled system, more chrome, avenger insignia (a brand new logo for a whole new identity), digital meter, wide rear tyre, low slung seating and long wheel base, the Avenger 220 Cruise gathered a lot of attention and sales inquiries.
Another highlight was the the Pulsar Virtual Reality experience that allowed users to experience a ride of a lifetime using immersive virtual reality technology. Using an oculus device, while seated on a Bajaj Pulsar RS 200, visitors were able to race each other. Pulsar RS200 is defined as the Performance Biking Machine and this super sports bike belongs to the Race Sports genre, designed for speed and performance.
Powered by the world’s first Triple Spark 4-Valve DTS-i engine which gives a power of 24.5 PS, this monster is packed with 40 per cent more power than that of other leading super sports bikes.
