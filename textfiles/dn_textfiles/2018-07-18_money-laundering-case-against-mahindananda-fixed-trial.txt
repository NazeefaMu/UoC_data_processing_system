Money laundering case against Mahindananda fixed for trial

A case filed against former Sports Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage for allegedly purchasing a house worth Rs. 27 million at Kynsey Road, Colombo 7 over a complaint that he had allegedly purchased the property through illegally acquired money, was yesterday fixed for trial on October 10 by the Colombo High Court.
The Court of Appeal had issued an order transferring this case to another court of competent jurisdiction other than the Colombo High Court presided over by High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga.
Accordingly, this case was yesterday taken up before High Court Judge Sampath Abeykoon and 17th witness in the case was noticed to appear before court on the next trial date.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against Mahindananda Aluthgamage alleging that Aluthgamage had purchased a house at Kynsey Road, Colombo 7 from an individual named Christopher Roshan for Rs. 27 million. The Attorney General alleged that the accused has failed to disclose how he was able to raise the money for the purchase of the house and further alleged that he had committed an offence that comes under Section 3 and 4 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.
The former Minister stands accused of financial irregularities in a complaint lodged against him by the convener of the Voice Against Corruption Wasantha Samarasinghe.
Deputy Solicitor General Thusith Mudalige appeared for the Attorney General. Counsel Kanchana Ratwatte appeared for the accused.
