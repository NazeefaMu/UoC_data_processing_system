He said the government had decided to construct three Liquefied Natural Gas power plants to address the increasing electricity demand in future. Cabinet approval for the construction of the three power plants has been given.
One Liquefied Natural Gas power plant is planned to be constructed with Indian assistance while two more will be constructed with Japanese and Chinese assistance. The Minister stated that the government has plans to construct a store for Liquefied Natural Gas to be maintained in collaboration with the Korean Government.Cabinet approval has been granted for the project as well.
Minister Siyambalapitiya also stated that the government has decided to maintain a mixed power generation plan which is required by the country and the cabinet has granted approval for it as well.
The Ruwanwella Rajasinghe Vidyalaya was granted solar panels worth of Rs 1 million while. The power generation will be supplied to the national grid while the school could get the required power for their use.
