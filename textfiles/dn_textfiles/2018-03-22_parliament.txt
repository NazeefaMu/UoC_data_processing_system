MP Athuraliye Rathana Thera blasts attempts to relax ban on Glyphosate
Independent MP Athuraliye Rathana Thera yesterday, delivered a strong and influential speech against attempt to relax the ban on Glyphosate. Rathana Thera went on to say that if the Joint Opposition had the same line of thinking as he does on the controversial Glyphosate issue, he is ready to “jump into their bandwagon,” in order to defeat anybody who is attempting to relax the ban on the weed killer. Rathana Thera also queried as to what happened to the Parliament Interim Committee appointed to look into the matter.
MP Rathana Thera made these observations following a question by UNP MP Thushara Indunil Amarasena on the Niroga lottery which was introduced as a fund for patients suffering from Kidney diseases, to which State Minister of Finance and Media Eran Wickremeratne replied.
In his reply, State Minister Wickremeratne said that Professor Buddhi Marabe had debunked the myth that there is a correlation between Glyphosate and kidney disease that dominates the North Central area of the country. “We are not experts on this subject. So we need to listen to these experts when taking policy decisions. This information has now being forwarded to President Maithripala Sirisena as well,” he said.
MP Amarasena then stood up to point out that there were two opinions that had emerged in relation to this Glyphosate issue. “One group believed that Rathana Thera would support the toppling of the present government, if it was to relax the ban on Glyphosate. Another group seems to believe that those who are in favour of Glyphosate, are planning to topple the government if it did not lift the ban. It is not clear as to which opinion the government should follow,” MP Amarasena said.
“The decision to topple the government if a necessity arises, would be decided by the general public and not by any of us. There are three hundred thousand Kidney patients in this country and you are quoting this Buddhi Marabe? Is he the only scientist in this country? What about scientists such as Ravin Senanayake and Priyani Gamage? When the government first set to ban the weed killer, a committee consisting of nearly hundred or so personnel, reasoned out and promoted the ban. So what are you now talking about?” MP Rathana Thera questioned.
“There was an interim committee appointed to look into this matter. The committee consisted of Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne and Minister Susil Premjayantha. What happened to that committee? Where is its report? Where is this person who come from America to address this matter. How can he have a say in lifting the ban on Glyphosate?” Rathana Thera further quaried.
MP Dinesh Gunawardena rose in support of Rathana Thera and expressed JO’s fullest support to him in the matter.
My speech was in no way disrespectful of SC Judges: Ranjan
Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake yesterday, denied claims that his speech against crime and corruption was in noway disrespectful of the 13 Supreme Court Judges who are holding office at present. Ramanayake further said that he stands by every word of his speech and that he would not withdraw any opinion included in the speech.
Meanwhile, Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa condemned the speech delivered by Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake in Parliament last Tuesday (21), claiming that the independent judiciary should not be attacked under cover of Parliamentary privileges. Leader of the House Minister Lakshman Kiriella, in a swift reply quipped that “It was you people who sacked Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayake.”
Several Joint Opposition supporters, including MP Dinesh Gunawardena, MP Wimal Weerawansa and MP Bandula Gunawardena, criticized Ramanayake’s speech made yesterday on issues relating to the system countering crime and corruption in the country. They claimed that Ramanayake’s speech was a contempt of court and should have been stopped by the presiding member in the Chair.
Minister Kiriella refusing the common point of view of JO supporters, said that MPs are allowed to speak their heart out in Parliament. Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said that he would look into the matter.
JO opposes Active Liability Management Bill
Joint Opposition MP Bandula Gunawardena objecting to the Active Liability Management Bill, said the JO would hamper its passage in Parliament unless the Government amends it as per JO’s request.
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella told the House that the Active Liability Management Bill scheduled to be taken up for debate yesterday, would be moved today. He said the Government decided to postpone its debate by two days, because different opinions have been expressed with regard to the Bill.
However, Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Dissanayake, questioned the fluctuating positions of the Government, stating that it was better the Government did not convene Parliament in this manner. “What is the purpose of having Party Leaders’ Meetings prior to setting the Agenda if the Government changes it later? At the PLM we told the Government not to take up this Bill today, because there were certain problems in its content, but the Government at that time, argued that they needed it urgently. Then again, it changes its stances and postpones it like tamed kittens. Why cannot the Government stay fixed to one decision?” he asked.
The Government presented the Active Liability Management Bill for first reading on February 19. The objective of the Bill is to manage public debt to ensure the financing needs and payment obligations of the Government are met at the lowest possible cost over the medium to long term consistent with a prudent degree of risk. The new Bill allows borrowing in advance for debt servicing in future.
JO MP Bandula Gunawardena said the Bill tries to grab Parliamentary powers over public finances. National Policies and Economic Affairs State Minister Dr Harsha de Silva pointed out that the JO previously challenged the Bill in the Supreme Court, but the SC determined that the provisions of the Active Liability Management Bill are consistent with the Constitution.
“This Bill is an important one and the Government wants it to be passed in Parliament soon,” he said.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said a final decision on taking up the Bill for debate on Friday, would be taken at a Party Leaders’ Meeting at 12 noon today.
COPE highlights irregularities at SLFEB from 2012 - 2014
The Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) in its latest report, has highlighted a series of financial irregularities that had occurred at the Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Bureau(SLFEB) from 2012-2014.
The report was tabled in the House by COPE Chairman and JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti yesterday. It comprises the findings of COPE on 12 public enterprises which came under its probe from March 1, 2017 to June 30, 2017.
The Auditor General’s Department has submitted to the Committee a special audit investigation report on misappropriation of a sum of Rs 247 million by officials of the Bureau during the 2012-2014 period using falsified documents.
An independent investigation in this regard had been carried out by the Bureau, but its final report is yet to come out. The audit query reveals details of 24 alleged irregularities, but the Bureau had only managed to complete the investigation and impose punitive action against a single case.
Some of the cases have been referred to the FCID. The COPE has directed the Foreign Employment Promotion Ministry Secretary and the Bureau Chairman to conclude the above investigations within a period of four months and respond to audit queries within a period of one month.
The COPE has instructed the AG to produce a Special Investigation Report pertaining to these 24 cases by obtaining audit responses of the Bureau, so that the Committee could table it in Parliament.
Among the 24 cases are a fraud involving cheques worth Rs 800,000 and preparing falsified documents and awarding a sum of Rs 1.6 million to a non-governmental organization in a fraudulent manner.
The report also details the findings on Vocational Technology University, University Grants Commission, General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University, State Pharmaceuticals Corporation, Lanka Coal Company (Private) Limited, Lanka Salt Company, Board of Investment, National Institute of Education, Sri Jayewardenepura General Hospital Board, Lanka Hospitals Corporation PLC and Gal Oya Plantations (Pvt) Limited.
‘Responsibility of loss lies on captain’s shoulders’
The responsibility of a loss recorded by any given team, let it be cricket, politics or otherwise, should be taken by the team captain, Sports Minister SLFP MP Dayasiri Jayasekara said yesterday.
The statement came in the backdrop of question asked by MP Rohini Kumari Wijeratne, requesting Minister Jayasekara to explain as to who was responsible for the continuous losses recorded by the Sri Lankan National Cricket team. Is it the Cricket Board, the Minister or someone else who is to be responsible? she asked. Wijeratne also hinted that there is a no confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe which could be taken as the setting to the answer Minister Jayasekara was about to provide.
An amused Jayasekara who was compelled to answer the question, came back with an "I know who made you pose a question such as this," and continued saying that the team captain should take the responsibility for the losses recorded by his or her team. MP Wijeratne denied Jayasekara’s allegation that someone influenced her to ask the question. “This is my question, not anyone elses.”
Minister Jayasekara referring to the question asked by MP Wijeratne, requested everyone to refrain from using cricket as a political means.
MP Wijeratne initially questioned Jayasekara on the income earned through the matches held at the Dambulla International Cricket Stadium and on the staff assigned to the same. Jayasekara expressed his disappointment in Wijeratne for not knowing that 51 cricket matches had been held at the Dambulla Stadium between female cricket teams.
“This is the area you represent. Even yesterday, there was a cricket match between two female international cricket teams. I will make sure to send you tickets to some of these matches,” Jayasekara said in a lighter vein.
‘American Water (Pvt.) Ltd. abusing ground water system in Artigala’
Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader MP Dinesh Gunawardena yesterday, brought to the attention of Parliament the excessive use of ground water through tube wells by a private company named ‘American Water (Pvt.) Ltd.’
He said the said company had abused the ground water system in Artigala in Kelani Valley, leading to the wells and other natural water sources to go dry.
“This company is provided with a permit to bottle only 200,000 litres, but they have already exceeded the limit and bottles over 700,000 litres by pumping out the ground water. They continue to operate ignoring public protests. When I raised this matter, the Government last year agreed to stop it, but no action had been taken up to now. Even though their name is ‘American Water,’ it is not an American company,” he added.
Replying to the MP’s concerns, City Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauff Hakeem, told Parliament that a Cabinet paper was moved some time ago to regulate the tube well use in Sri Lanka to prevent excessive use of ground water. “A Gazette notification was approved, but I am not sure whether it was issued or not,” Minister Hakeem said.
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella reading out the answer received from the Irrigation Ministry, said water meters are to be fixed to that water resource shortly to monitor the amount of water being pumped out. “It is true that no measuring mechanism is currently available at that water source. Once gauging devices are fixed, legal action would be taken against any violations of permit rules,” he added.
Ganeshan requests Speaker to assign parliamentary staff to translate PRECIFAC report
Minister Mano Ganeshan yesterday, requested the Speaker of Parliament to assign a team of parliamentary staff to translate the PRECIFAC report if there is an immediate requirement of the report.
Ganeshan, the Minister of National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages, informed the House that the Official Languages Department would only be able to submit the said report in the month of May this year. Accordingly, he requested to turn to other options available if the House was in a hurry to receive the translated report.
Minister Ganeshan also said that the Official Languages Department had not received the Treasury bond report to be translated. “We have only received the PRECIFAC report, not the Treasury Bond Commission report,” he informed. Several MPs on Tuesday, raised concerns with regard to the continuous delay in the debate on these two reports due to the absence of these reports in all three official languages.
