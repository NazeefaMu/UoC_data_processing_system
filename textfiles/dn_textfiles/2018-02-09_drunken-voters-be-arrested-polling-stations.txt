Drunken voters to be arrested at polling stations

Elections Commission has issued instructions to the Police Department that those who enter polling centres for casting their votes on February 10 after having consumed liquor should be immediately taken into custody.
If candidates support such offending persons to cast votes, the candidature of such irresponsible candidates too would be at risk of cancellation this time, at the LG polls. Also, the Elections Commission has announced that no parades or demonstrations by voters or winning candidates should take place on roads and public main roads on February 11 after the LG polls on February 10, as such parades are illegal.
Therefore, participants and organizers of such demonstrations would have to undergo legal punishments according to the instructions and guidelines issued by Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya, said Kurunegala Senior Divisional Secretary W. E. Jayathilake when he was contacted by Daily News yesterday (08) in Kurunegala.
