32nd All Island School Athletic Meet : Two meet records set up on second day

Lasith Ranasinghe of Bandaranayake College, Gampaha and M.K. Poornima Jayamali of Leeds International College, Panadura set up two new meet records on the second day of the 32nd All Island School Athletic Meet at Bogambara yesterday.
In the boys under 17 javelin throw event Lasith recorded 66.96 metres while Poornima Jayamali leaped 1.74 metres in the under 19 girls high jump event. The previous record (65.51 metres) of I.A. Paranagama of Nalanda College, Colombo in 2002 was erased by Lasith on the second day of the meet.
The earlier record of 1.70 metres in the girls high jump was held jointly by Tharanga Vinodani of Vijitha Central College, Dickwella (2002), R.A.K. Priyangika Maduwanthi of Maliyadeva Balika, Kurunegala (2008) and Nimeshika Madushani Siriwardana of Galenbindunuwewa Central College (2011).
“I have been suffering from diabetes from grade eight. I took to sport to reduce my diabetic level. Now my sugar level is normal,” said 16-year-old Lasith who will sit for the GCE O/L exam in December.
Lalith’s father is the principal of Heenkenda Maha Vidyalaya, Kelaniya while his mother is deputy principal of Henegama Central College.
Lasith earlier participated in the shot putt event but his coach Susantha Kularatne asked him to concentrate on the javelin throw. Lasith competed with older players and became third place at Sir John Tarbet Athletic Meet last year. He was also crowned champion at the Western Province Athletic Meet held in July. “My dream is to qualify for the Asian Junior Athletic Championship in 2018,” he said.
