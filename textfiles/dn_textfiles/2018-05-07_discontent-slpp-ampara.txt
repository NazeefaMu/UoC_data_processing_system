Discontent in SLPP in Ampara

The Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna (Pohottuwa) leader in the Ampara district has ordered all SLPP members of urban councils and pradeshiya sabhas in the district to attend the SLPP May Day rally in Galle today, with a busload of supporters. The majority of SLPP members have criticised this order in public, saying they are not prepared to abide by it, due to the injustice caused in appointing SLPP members as chairman and vice chairman to local councils in the district.
