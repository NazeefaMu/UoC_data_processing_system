President instructs immediate resettlement

The government has given priority for the resettlement of farmer families being evacuated in order for the Lower Malwathu Oya Reservoir Project to be carried out smoothly. President Maithripala Sirisena has instructed relevant authorities to immediately begin the resettlement process before commencing the main construction components of the project. In order to avoid any complications similar to those being experienced by the Anuradhapura Yan Oya Reservoir scheme, where construction work for the resettlement programme is lagging behind.
It has been planned to block the Yan Oya near Thanthirimale with a 3.5-km long main dam. At present, the surveying of the resettlement landscapes is in progress.
The capacity of the proposed reservoir is 169,440 acre-feet and the landscapes being acquired for the project is around 10,900 acres. The estimated cost for the project is Rs. 12.5 million. The main objectives of the project are providing irrigational water to cultivate around 35,000 acres in the Anuradhapura and Mannar districts; providing drinking water to people in the Anuradhapura, Vavuniya, and Mannar districts; and to address the annual flood threat being experienced in the Malwathu Oya downstream areas.
Referring to the present situation of the project, Anuradhapura government Agent and Lower Malwathu Oya Reservoir Project Progress Review Committee Head R. M. Wanninayake told the Daily News that a landscape of around 22,000 acres have been identified in Kaluwila, Narawila, Nalanda, Gatamuna, Randeniya, and Handapangoda for the resettlement of 600 farmer families.
"There are several problems to be resolved. Some of the locations selected for resettlement programme come under the high-conserved jungle belt of the Wilpattu National Park, belonging to both wildlife and the forest conservation departments. This issue has arisen regarding the landscapes proposed to be given as muddy lands to families being evacuated from the Handapangoda, Dematamalgoda, and Thanthirimale divisions," the government agent said.
With regard to the destitute families in the Thammennaalawaka in Medawachchiya Divisional Secretariate divisions, the muddy lands planned to be provided could be allocated close to where the affected families currently reside at, instead of providing accommodations in the south bank area, Wanninayaka added.
He added that as such, alternative muddy lands could be demarcated in more suitable and less forested zones along the south bank.
According to the government agent, those who are currently deprived of both muddy lands and highlands could be provided with such lands in adjoining areas located in the said south bank zone.
Wanninayake further said that if the resettlement programme has been adjusted as such that the highly conserved landscapes within the Wilpattu National Park would be intact and protected and added that the human-elephant conflict could be thwarted, while the productivity of the new settlement is enhanced. He said he would submit a report including the proposed recommendations and adjustments to the government.
