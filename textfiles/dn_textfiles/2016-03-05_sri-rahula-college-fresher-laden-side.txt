Sri Rahula College a fresher laden side

Sri Rahula College, Katugastota is one of Kandy's oldest cricket playing schools. They started the game in 1890's but gave up the game and were more involved in Football, Athletics and Hockey. However, again in the 1970's they returned to cricket and later they took to Rugby, and came on top at Mini Rugby. Sri Rahula was established, by the Buddhist Theosophical Society led by The American Colonel Henry Steel Olcott. It is one of the famous mixed colleges in Sri Lanka. The school was started as Kandy High School. This season, Sri Rahula with limited cricket facilities fields a fresher-laden side under the guidance of former S. Thomas' College, Combined Schools, University of Peradeniya, Saracens CC, Central Province and Sri Lanka President's XI cricketer Aubrey Kuruppu. He trains cricketers from a young age, to play good cricket and when they come up to under 17 level they are being snatched away by other schools. Most of the cricketers learn the finer points and later join other established schools.
The Rahulians are led by third-year player Jeevantha Wijeratne - left hand bat and a ff-spinner and Dilesha Madushanka - a fine right-arm leg-spinner is the vice captain. The other players who have done well at practices are Chamika Samarasekara, Malida Laithhewage, Darshana Ranaraja, Madushan Paranavitarane, Dilsh Krishantha, Gathika Wickremasinghe, Malith Rajapakse, Amila Wijesuriya, Ravindu Kapukotuwa, Dilsah Ambegedera, Parnda Kumaratunge, Sasuni Ranatunga, Madusha Thushara,
They play their big match against Waripayapola Sri Sumangala after a lapse of many years. Due to a misunderstanding the match was not played for a long time and today it is a one-day big match at Pallekelle Stadium.

Clifford Cup Knockouts
Defending champions Kandy Sports Club will play their first quarterfinals on Sunday March 13 against CH and FC at Nittawella in the Clifford Cup rugby knockout. If Kandy SC wins the semi-finals too will be played in Kandy at Pallekele or at Nittawela.
Why not in Kandy?
Today the biggest spectators patronizing rugby at club level is in Kandy. At a game in Kandy there are nearly ten thousand rugby fans, which one does not find in Colombo. So, why don't the SLRFU play the Clifford Cup final in Kandy?
Cricket Big match fever
Yet again, we are approaching the climax of another cricket season and the traditional Big Matches will be the focal point this month. The month of March is the time for the cricket loving public to revisit the good old days of school cricket. Stories of cricket heroics and the game's nostalgic memories re-emerge. While the youngsters take to the field keeping the good old tradition and take on their arch rivals, some call it 'cricket fever or big match fever'.
This 'fever' is said to have started when distinguished educational institutions, Trinity and St. Anthony's started a cricket rivalry called the 'Battle of the Blues' which is scheduled to be played this year on March 11 and 12. On the same day St. Sylvester's College will play Vidyartha College at Pallekelle International Stadium. The oldest big match in Kandy is when Dharmaraja play Kingswood on March 18h and 19 at Pallekelle International Stadium.

These two players have given their best and won many tournaments and are sure to reach the top in the game.
E.W. Balasuriya Trophy for rugby
A trophy will be in offer for a game of rugby between Kandy Sports Club and another top class club in the next league season. It is a worthy cause because E.W. Balasuriya was a true lover and promoter of sport.
He started his own club Kandy Lake Club in the 1960's and gave a big hand for sports like cricket, Iron sport, cue sport and rugby. The first sport he introduced was cricket and later started playing rugby in the "B" division. In 1966 they emerged champions and in the following year 1967 were promoted to play in the "A" division. After entering the "A" division the club went places in rugby. But sad to say they were knocked out by the authorities of that era, for playing professional players. With that blow he formed the Kandy RFC and played up to 1973 and in 1974 amalgamated it with Kandy Sports Club.

She was at the forefront of a mission to make the Kandy people, especially the children, aware of the heritage that they have inherited as citizens of Kandy.
To this end she headed several committees and worked together with local government authorities, businesses, schools, sports personalities and professionals to bring all perspectives and ideas together to ensure that Kandy continues to thrive in its rich history well into the future.
