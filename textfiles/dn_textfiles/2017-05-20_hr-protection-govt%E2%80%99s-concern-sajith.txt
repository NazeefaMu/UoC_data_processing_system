HR protection govt’s concern: Sajith

Foreign advice deemed redundant:
Counsel from foreign nations on the protection of human rights is unwarranted as the government has considered its protection as its prime duty and responsibility, Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa said.
He was addressing a meeting after laying foundation stones for the ‘Ekamuthupura’ housing scheme to be built for youth representing all communities at Kappalthurai, Trincomalee recently. Minister Premadasa and Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan laid the foundation stones for the housing scheme.
Premadasa said this was the 363rd model village launched by the government.
Three housing schemes were launched in the Trincomalee district. Work on 500 new model housing schemes will be started before the end of this year, he said.
Premadasa said ‘Ekamuthupura’ could be described as a symbol of the government’s efforts to promote communal and religions harmony and reconciliation in the country.
Opposition Leader Sampanthan said he could recall the opening of a new housing scheme named ‘Vipulananda’ in Kuchchuweli by Minister Sajith Premadasa’s father President R. Premadasa when he was Housing Minister in 1967.
Sampanthan said the untimely death of President Premadasa was a national loss as he was a leader with great foresight who came to the assistance of homeless and unemployed people through his model housing and garment industries programmes. Eastern Province Chief Minister Nazeer Ahmed, Provincial Minister Ariyawathie Galappathty and Parliamentarian Imran Maharoof were also present.
Minister Premadasa also distributed housing loans among 24 families and masonry equipment and uniforms among 88 masons under the ‘Shilpeeya Saviya’ programme.
