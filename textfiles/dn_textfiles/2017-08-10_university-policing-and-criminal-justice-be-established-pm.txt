Setting out the government’s plans dedicated to ensuring capacity building of the Police force, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Tuesday announced that a University for Policing and Criminal Justice will be established in Sri Lanka. The Prime Minister made the announcement while attending the inauguration ceremony of the Senior Officers Inter Regional Conference on Countering Terrorism and Transnational Crime organised by the INTERPOL along with the Sri Lanka Police at the BMICH yesterday.

According to Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, while Military education and training in the country has developed rapidly the Police in the last two decades have fallen behind.
“Therefore,the university will be the apex body dedicated to the studies on Policing in Sri Lanka,” the Prime Minister said adding that the government expects to expand its functions to provide education to qualified individuals across the region. “It can be a University for the region,” he said.
According to the Prime Minister, the university can be Sri Lanka’s contribution to the region for combatting terrorism and transnational crime which are becoming more of a Police function today by developing the capacity building of the region’s Police forces.
