Special Circular preventing students from being used for protests

A special circular was issued by the Education Ministry yesterday preventing students from being used for protests during school hours. In accordance with the circular issued under the signature of Education Ministry Secretary  Sunil Hettiarchchi addressed to Provincial Education Secretaries, Provincial Education Directors and Zonal Education Directors, with copies to the Inspector General of Police, Provincial Chief Secretaries and Principals of National Schools,using students for protests has been banned and prohibited.
Besides, under this circular no outsider or outside groups are allowed to enter schools or address students without due permission.
The Ministry has issued the circular since it has been revealed that certain parties are trying to spread extremist ideas among school students against carrying out government’s policies and plans.
This situation badly affects the teaching and learning process in the school system and moreover a hindrance to maintaining students’ discipline.
Under the circular, all principals are advised not to grant permission for the holding of any meetings, discussions in schools without prior approval from the Education Ministry Secretary, Provincial Education Secretaries or Provincial Education Directors.
