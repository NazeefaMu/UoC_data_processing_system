Thomians  can cook!

Little Thomians of St. Thomas’ Catholic International College had a fireless cooking day last week. The event was organised to help children to be independent and to encourage them to eat healthy. Dressed in colourful aprons and chef hats, children of nursery, LKG and UKG classes made fruit kebabs, egg buns, vegetable sandwiches, milk shakes and many more food items. Rector of the college Rev Fr. Kennedy Perera, Primary principal, Sr Nalini and the teachers of STIC enjoyed this fun filled day with the little ones. Pictures by Dilan Paulpetar
