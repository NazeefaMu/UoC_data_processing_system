H’tota Port workers’ parents hold protest

The parents of workers of the Hambantota Magampura Port engaged in a protest yesterday at the Magampura Port Administration building to demand that the government secure the jobs of their children.
“We have no objections to the lease of the Port to China, but all we ask is that the Ports Authority give our children appointment letters and employ them under the new agreement as well,” said the Parents’ Association President M.K. Jayadasa. He added that they would engage in a fast unto death if a long-term solution to their problem was not provided. The present workers of the Port are yet to be informed whether they would be absorbed into the new venture with the Chinese.
