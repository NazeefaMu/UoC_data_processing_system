ACS - the professional body for Australia's ICT sector - announced on November 25 that Sri Lankan born Yohan Ramasundara was elected as the ACS President effective from January 1, 2018 for a two-year term.
Ramasundara completed his schooling at Thurstan College Colombo before moving to Australia to further his education in late 1990s. He pursued his passion for technology by graduating with Bachelor of IT degree from University of Canberra. In recognising how vital ICT education and collaboration is to the prosperity of communities, Ramasundara has led major international initiatives including conferences and leadership assemblies.
Ramasundara is the youngest president to be elected at ACS for over two decades and is currently the Vice President overseeing ACS Membership Advisory Board, having previously transformed the ACS financial performance as the National Treasurer for five years from 2012 to 2016.
He is also the Secretary General of SEARCC - the Asia Pacific forum for professional ICT associations. He is the Head of Governance for the Australian government agency administering IP rights. He recently returned to Australia from a secondment as the Innovation Manager for International Operations in San Francisco, California, with the Australian trade mission.
In 2018-19 Ramasundara's leadership team includes Dr Nick Tate, Vice President overseeing the Professional Advisory Board; Dr Ian Oppermann, Vice President overseeing the Technical Advisory Board; Anthony Wong as Immediate Past President; Arnold Wong as Treasurer; Andrew Johnson, ACS CEO; and four branch representatives.
Ramasundara said, ‘As President, I will build on the platforms ACS has laid over the last 50 years.‘I look forward to collaborating across ACS and building our credibility as a trusted advisor to government, industry, academia and our members."
Ramasundara acknowledged the work of the outgoing president Anthony Wong. "As ACS President, Anthony has worked tirelessly for the past two years, bringing to the role his in-depth knowledge of the ICT industry and the organisation of which he has been a member since 2001. During Anthony's leadership, ACS’ engagement with government at a state/territory and federal level grew markedly during 2016 and 2017, building strong networks and advocating for ACS, its members and the ICT profession.
In his spare time Ramasundara enjoys all things related to innovation and the start-up ecosystem. He has also served as a Cricket Australia umpire with an impressive record officiating at a national level over many years.
