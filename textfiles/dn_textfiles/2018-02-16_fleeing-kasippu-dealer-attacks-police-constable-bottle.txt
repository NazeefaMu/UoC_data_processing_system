Fleeing kasippu dealer attacks police constable with bottle

A kasippu dealer was arrested by the Mihintale Police for allegedly attacking a police constable with a bottle of kasippu and causing injury to him when a police team raided his hideout on the Mahakandarawa tank bund, on information that he is running a kasippu distillery there on February 14.
Police said, when the police team raided the spot, the suspect had run away and tried to climb a ladder to get into a tree-top watch hut. When the constable concerned tried to capture him by pulling his legs, the suspect had hit the constable on the head with a bottle containing kasippu that he was carrying with him.
The police constable who received injuries on his head was admitted to the Mihintale Hospital and later transferred to the Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital for further treatment.
The 53 year old suspect who is in police custody, was due to be produced before the Kahatagasdigiliya Circuit Magistrate. Police investigations are continuing.
