Success story of bone marrow transplants

All 10 bone marrow transplants by the Bone Marrow Transplant Unit of the Maharagama Apeksha Hospital in the last six months have been successful, Unit Specialist Dr Prasad Abeysinghe said.
Patients needed to go abroad to get a transplant done earlier. It would cost Rs. 4-5 million, he said. The Health Ministry provides antibiotics needed by the patients.
Dr. Abeysinghe said the operations were done according to the international standards. He had a team of 16 including four specialist doctors trained in Australia, five nurses, another four doctors and laboratory technicians.
The operations were started in December 2016.
The President’s Fund provides Rs. 300,000 for all tests to be made before the operation to the needy.
