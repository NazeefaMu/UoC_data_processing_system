Government assume they can rule  only with FCID, CID, PD: MR

 The government assume that they can rule the country only with the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID), Criminal Investigation Department (CID), and Prisons Department (PD), former President and Kurunegala district parliamentarian Mahinda Rajapaksa said.
He was addressing a Joint Opposition rally ‘Peraliyaka, Erabuma’ in Habaraduwa, Galle on Saturday.
“Today the law is enforced to the rulers’ tune. MP Wimal Weerawansa is in remand without bail. What does the government expect from such exercises? They believe that they can rule the country by jailing all opponents,” Rajapaksa said.
He said both leaders are responsible for this situation and one is in parliament, while the other is steering from overseas. He said that he had been a president of the country and he never said that he was not aware of things happened in the country.
“I never stated that I came to know about certain happenings from the newspapers. If anyone is trying to dodge the responsibilities on affairs of the country due to his unawareness of such incidents, we do not believe such excuses. The Executive Presidency is offered to execute the executive powers,” former President said.
He said the Executive President and an Executive Prime Minister would be disastrous to the country and either the President or the Prime Minister should work for the country. At present both do nothing, he said. “I hold both responsible for the present situation of the country and in general, the whole government is answerable for contemporary problems of the country, Rajapaksa said.
“We should not isolate Wimal Weerawansa at this juncture. If we evade our obligation and duty, no one would stand for us when a need arises. We all should stand against the government’s suppression,” he said.
Rajapaksa urged the media to speak and write against such unfair activities and added that the media is threatened now. “The media should not get discouraged by threats. If the media does not accomplish their duties, no one will come forward for their rescue,” he said.
He said the government does not hold elections on time and challenged the government to dissolve the Provincial Councils and hold elections in the South if they can.
“The government is speaking about the loans for the Hambantota Port. They say they have to repay Rs. 155 billion. Now the oil prices have come down globally. The government is earning Rs. 6,000 billion from oil. Why they do not give the benefits of the reduction to the people. They can settle the loans from those earnings. They did not launch a single development project other than schemes carried out during our rule? A section of parliamentarians have obtained ministerial portfolios and enjoying perks of them,” the former President said. Former President commended Galle district parliamentarian Dr. Ramesh Pathirana and Southern Provincial Councillor Isuru Dodangoda for their courage.
“Today all forces against the government have united. Minority communities have justifiable grievances. They were also deceived. Now they have understood it,” Rajapaksa said.
Colombo district parliamentarian and JO parliamentary group leader Dinesh Gunawardena, Galle district parliamentarian Dr. Ramesh Pathirane, New Left Front Leader and Ratnapura district MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara, and Lanka Samasamaja Party leader Tissa Witharana spoke.
Galu Korale Chief Sanghanayaka Baddegama Devarakkitha took part in the rally. Former minister Basil Rajapaksa, Former Speaker and parliamentarian Chamal Rajapaksa were present.
