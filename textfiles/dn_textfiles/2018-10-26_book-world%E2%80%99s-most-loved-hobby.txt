Book on world’s most loved hobby

Collecting stamps is a hobby both young and old can enjoy. Stamps are miniature gateways to the world as they depict geography, biography, history, culture and art of various countries.
Philatelic Journalist and representative of the International Association of Philatelic Journalists, Anura Samaraweera through his latest book `A Guide to Stamp Collecting’ opens avenues for young enthusiasts to learn the unknown facts about stamp collecting.
“Children and teenagers were early collectors of stamps. Many adults dismissed it as a childish pursuit but later many of those same collectors, as adults, began to systematically study the available postage stamps and publish books about them. Today, though the number of collectors is somewhat less, stamp collecting is still one of the world's most popular indoor hobbies. There are thousands of organizations for collectors such as local stamp clubs, special-interest groups, and national organizations. Most nations have a national collectors' organization. Stamp clubs and philatelic societies can add a social aspect to stamp collecting and provide a forum where novices can meet experienced collectors,” he said.
Samaraweera has started penning books on stamps in 1984 when he was working as a Postal Officer at the Postal Department. He has researched and gathered information on stamps and has contributed many articles on stamp collecting to Mihira, Bindu, Navayugaya among many other children’s papers.
“Through my latest book I intend to introduce stamp collecting to beginners and guide them on how to make an exhibit in international exhibitions. Many casual stamp collectors accumulate stamps for sheer enjoyment and relaxation without worrying about the tiny details. The creation of a large or comprehensive collection, however, generally requires some philatelic knowledge and will usually contain areas of philatelic studies,” he said.
He pointed out that most of the collectors are not aware of the opportunities that exist at international level for stamp collectors. Samaraweera is Sri Lanka’s National Commissioner for the World Stamp Exhibition Thailand, one of the world’s high profile philatelic event displaying approximately 2,500 frames of exhibits from all Federation Internationale de Philatelie (FIP) member countries.
He has bagged the Silver Brown award at Hong Kong EXPO International 2004, Large Silver at Kuala Lampur Stamp Show, Silver Brown at Taipei 2005 International Stamp Exhibition and Silver Brown award at Bangkok International Stamp Exhibition.
