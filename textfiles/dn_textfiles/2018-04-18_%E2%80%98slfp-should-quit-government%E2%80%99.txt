‘SLFP should quit Government’

“Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) should quit the Government. The Prime Minister has 122 members on his side enabling him to carry out governance on his own,” former Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said.
He was attending the court session of Mahindananda Aluthgamage at the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court.
“After President’s arrival to the country, all the parliamentarians expect to gather for a discussion,” the former minister said.
“The attempt of the government to remand former Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage for the embezzlement of funds amounting to Rs. 39 million was made because we voted for the No Confidence Motion (NCM) to remove the Prime Minister from office,” former Highways State Miniser Dilan Perera said.
“The citizens have faith in the court and the court system should stand firmly on its own. There is no such thing as a joint opposition. Any party could come and join us,’’ he said
