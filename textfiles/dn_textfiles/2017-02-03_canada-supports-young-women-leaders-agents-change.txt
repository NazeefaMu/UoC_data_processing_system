Canada Supports Young Women Leaders as Agents of Change

The High Commissioner of Canada to Sri Lanka and Ambassador to Maldives, Shelley Whiting, today launched the second Regional Young Women Leaders Dialogue which brings young women leaders from Afghanistan, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Pakistan and Sri Lanka together for a four-day series of meetings and discussions in Colombo and Delhi on the role of women and youth as agents of change.
The Colombo component of this initiative is being organised by the High Commission of Canada to Sri Lanka in cooperation with Canadian Embassies and High Commissions in Afghanistan, India, and Pakistan. Key Sri Lankan partners include the Ministry of Women’s Affairs and the Women’s Parliamentary Caucus, the Parliament of Sri Lanka, the Bandaranaike Centre for International Studies, Kelaniya University’s Gender Studies Unit and Hashtag Generation. This year’s event builds on the successful 2016 Regional Women Parliamentarians Dialogue, which included participation from women parliamentarians in Sri Lanka and the region.
Commenting on the dialogue, High Commissioner Whiting stated that “the young women gathered
from across the region and Sri Lanka are our leaders of today and tomorrow. We need to tap into
and recognise the value they bring to the table on the whole gamut of issues that we need to address collectively, for the betterment of our communities and countries.”
