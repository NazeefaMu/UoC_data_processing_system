Reaching out to the needy

In a bid to contribute to social advancement of Sri Lanka’s less-advantaged communities, 4rever Skin Naturals initiated its CSR platform, ‘4rever SadhaRekawaranaya’ with a programme at the Tamil Mixed School in Chavakachcheri on the sidelines of the Jaffna International Trade Fair recently.
4rever Skin Naturals served as the beauty partner at the Jaffna International Trade Fair. As part of the CSR programme, 4rever renovated the cooking facilities at the Tamil Mixed School in Chavakachcheri and gifted its students with school bags, books as well as shoes and socks. Prior to renovation, the cooking facilities were in a dilapidated and a hygienically poor condition.
The decision to renovate this particular building sprang from the genuine desire to help the school children enjoy nutritious and hygienic meals in future. In addition, 4rever hosted an inspiring motivational and guidance session targeting all the students at the school including 17 children suffering from some form of learning disability as well as children who have been identified as a slow-learner.
“It was an inspiring as well as a heartfelt occasion for all of us at 4rever Skin Naturals. Seeing the children’s faces light up with happy smiles and teachers and parents too smile warmly in response was wonderful. We all returned home with a warm feeling deep inside our hearts knowing that the children will be able savour wholesome food made in a safe and a clean environment in future,” states Founder & Chairperson, 4rever Skin Naturals Chandhani Bandara in a press release.
