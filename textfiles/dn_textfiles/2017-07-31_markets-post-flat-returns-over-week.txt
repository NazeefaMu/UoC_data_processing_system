Point of view
Equity markets moved sideways this week, consolidating at 6660-levels as positive quarterly earnings from Index heavy-weight JKH and Cabinet approval of the Hambantota Port deal capped the W-o-W losses on the Index at ~4 points.
Market activity remained largely dull though with HNI and Institutional investors opting to remain on the sidelines over the week.
Crossings over the week consequently fell to 30% of total market turnover, in sharp contrast to the previous two week’s when crossings averaged ~45% of total market turnover.
Foreign inflows to the Colombo bourse also slowed over the week, declining ~31% W-o-W to LKR 0.9Bn. Net foreign inflows nevertheless, remained positive for the 26th consecutive week this year.
Net flows to equities have remained consistently positive since early February with weekly net inflows averaging LKR1.0Bn. YTD net inflows on the CSE have consequently totaled LKR 24.9Bn, with net inflows over July rising to LKR 3.5Bn cf. LKR 2.7Bn in June, but lower than the net inflow of LKR 5.1Bn in March and net inflow of LKR 10.8Bn in April.
Markets in the week ahead are likely to look for cues both from the CBSL’s policy decision on Thursday and corporate earnings releases over the week.
SLA introduces new restructuring plan
Sri Lankan Airline’s unveiled a fresh restructuring plan this week which is to run simultaneously with the GoSL’s efforts find a strategic investor and which focuses on issues such as aviation fuel price, aircraft leases, debt servicing costs and, human resource realignment1.
The new plan is aimed at improving operational efficiency and reducing losses and should help ease interest rate pressure as credit to state owned business enterprises (SOBEs) eases.
Credit obtained by SOBE’s rose 9% Y-o-Y in Apr’17, amid losses over Q1’17 from the major non-bank SOBEs (CEB, CPC and SLA).
Sri Lankan Airline (SLA) meanwhile, recorded a 55% Y-o-Y increase in losses in the Jan-Apr 2017 period (to Rs. 9.5Bn cf. loss of Rs. 6.1BN in Jan-Apr 2016) while accumulated losses reached Rs.170Bn and its negative net worth totaled Rs.116Bn2.
Losses on Sri Lanka’s non-financial SOBEs accounted for ~2% of GDP in 2012 and although these losses have since reduced (0.6% of GDP by 2016), the recent increase in credit obtained by SOBEs poses some risk to the behavior of overall domestic credit and interest rates even amid the decline in net credit to the government and inflows to G-Secs.
