The right to protest

The right to strike has been developed at international level by the International Labour Office (ILO) supervisory bodies but is not mentioned explicitly in ILO conventions or recommendations.
While there is consensus that the right to strike is an indispensable instrument for the exercise of workers’ economic and social rights, there is an ongoing debate about the need to strike a balance between the protection of these rights and the need to guarantee essential public services in order to safeguard citizens and their well-being in Sri Lanka. This piece presents practices in Europe.
Legal recognition of the right to strike
The term “strike” has been defined as “Any concerted stoppage of work by employees (including a stoppage by reason of the expiration of a collective-bargaining agreement) and any concerted slowdown or other concerted interruption of operations by employees”.
A first feature is that unions in countries with relatively few disputes tend to be large, as in Germany, where the unions are particularly well integrated into the bargaining process. Here a culture of a quest for “social harmony” prevails and strikes have to be preceded by negotiations, during which only “warning” stoppages are possible. If discussions fail, an arbitration process is necessary before a strike can be called. Strikes which take place despite all these attempts at conciliation must obey three basic principles: social order, proportionality and fairness. In addition, civil and public servants, who make up 30% of public service staff, do not have the right to strike, unlike employees in the private sector. Unions must also represent at least 75% of employees in order to be able to call a strike, and must see that it remains proportionate to the objectives.
In Finland, 80% of the working population belong to a trade union. Here, too, there is a basic tenet of social harmony and fines can be imposed for breaching it. In Sweden, a “compulsory social truce” has been introduced which prohibits strikes during the period when a collective agreement is still valid. Most collective agreements contain clauses prohibiting strikes or other types of industrial action during their validity. In the event of disagreement, the opposing parties are required to submit the matter to conciliation committees. Parliament may also end such a dispute through legislation.
Generally speaking, breach of strike regulations may incur various disciplinary, administrative, civil or criminal sanctions, depending on the country. In the United Kingdom, for example, contravention may lead to termination of contract, although the employer’s powers are limited here by Section 9 of the 1982 Employment Act.
In Ireland and Austria, too, a breach of the principles governing the right to strike may result in dismissal.
In Italy, for example, public services are treated as necessary for the realisation of fundamental rights and are established in the Constitution. The armed forces and law-enforcement agencies are not allowed to strike anywhere. In Germany, Austria, Denmark and Estonia, public servants do not have the right to strike either, in order to ensure the continuity of public services and in return for security of employment. In Turkey, a law barring public servants from striking was passed in 2001.
In Poland, a 1991 act limits strikes in that it prohibits those that are considered detrimental to life and health or that threaten state security.
There are similar restrictions in Slovakia, Slovenia and Hungary in addition to legal restrictions, certain constraints are imposed on the civil service under an agreement between civil-service unions and the Ministry of the Interior.
The parties have a legal duty to reach agreement in order to allow minimum service to be maintained, in particular for transport and electricity, gas and water supply during the pre-strike negotiation and arbitration periods.
In these four European countries legislation includes compulsory social-harmony clauses for trying to avoid strikes. In particular, the duty to preserve social harmony prohibits all industrial action during the negotiation of collective agreements, also known as “conciliation periods”.
In Germany, in addition to the three basic principles and the requirement that unions be truly representative, only workers who have belonged to a trade union for at least three months have the right to strike.
Switzerland has regulated the right to strike in its constitution and says that strikes and lockouts are admissible as long as they concern industrial relations and do not violate any obligations to preserve labour peace or conduct arbitration. Swiss law may deny certain categories of workers the right to strike, for example in order to guarantee essential public services such as the safety of the state, the safeguarding of central interests in foreign policy, or in securing the supply of vital goods and services to the country.
Categories include civil and military senior management, federal prosecuting staff, diplomatic staff abroad, border guards, customs officials and military air traffic controllers.
"Minimum service" in essential services in Europe
The European Social Charter provides a number of particulars in this respect.
Firstly, in services whose suspension might endanger life, safety or health and which are essential services in the strict sense of the term. Secondly, a minimum-service requirement might be introduced in services which are not essential in the strict sense, but where strikes of a certain scale or duration might cause a national emergency threatening normal living conditions. Thirdly, it could be introduced in services of prime importance.
The “minimum service” in practice
With the exception of the United Kingdom, most Council of Europe countries have brought in regulations on a minimum service in the event of a strike in essential services.
The Constitutional Court of Spain has always taken into account the overriding need to protect users’ interests in the particular circumstances of each dispute. It has ruled that “the community’s right to vital services takes precedence over the right to strike”. It has further ruled that “a service is essential not by virtue of its nature but by virtue of the results expected of it, taking into account the nature of the interests it is intended to satisfy”.
In Spanish case law, the main essential sectors are transport, hospital health services, assistance services, energy supply, water purification and provision, the collection and treatment of solid waste, the postal services and education. The minimum-service arrangements are compulsory.
