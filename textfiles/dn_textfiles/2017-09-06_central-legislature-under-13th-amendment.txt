Central legislature under 13th Amendment

The Thirteenth Amendment has introduced a new conception of a unitary – decentralized State based on a system of Provincial Government at a sub-national level. This description is of extreme importance, since the Constitution specifically provides that the Republic of Sri Lanka is a Unitary State and the majority of the people attach much sentiment to the unitariness of Sri Lanka.
The 13th Amendment to the Constitution provides for the establishment of Provincial Councils. Article 154G (I) introduced by the Amendment vests legislative power in respect of matters set out in List I of the Ninth Schedule (the Provincial Council List) in the Provincial Councils.
The 13th Amendment transfers competence over certain specified areas from the ‘supreme’ Central legislature into elected provincial assemblies representing clearly defined spatial units. Basic to the structure of devolution is the competence jurisdiction – the separation of subjects and functions assigned to the Provincial Council and the Centre.
This separation is set out in the three lists under the Ninth Schedule to the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution: Provincial Council List (List I), Reserved List (List II) and Concurrent List (List III).
Article 154G enables the Provincial Council to make statutes. However, this power is subject to provision in the Constitution including Article 75 and Article 154(G) (10). A statute enacted by the Provincial Council does not attain the constitutional status of law as the definition of ‘law’ in Article 170 remains unamended. Similarly it does enjoy constitutional immunity or protection that is accorded to an Act of Parliament. (Article 82(3)).
Article 154C vests the executive power within a Province extending to the matters in List I in the Governor to be exercised in terms of Article 154F (I) on the advice of the Board of Ministers. In terms of Article 154F (6) the Board of Ministers is collectively responsible and answerable to the Provincial Council.
The main Constitutional provision relating to the Governor are found in Article 154B. The findings reveal that the degree of autonomy enjoyed by the Provincial Councils in the exercise of their legislative power is not found in the area of the exercise of their executive power.
Executive powers
The relevant provisions of the 13th Amendment and the Provincial Councils Act demonstrate that in the exercise of executive powers, the Provincial Councils are subject to the Centre and are not sovereign bodies.
The provisions relating to the Governor and his powers show that the Governor is not a mere figurehead, but is an active participant in the activities of the Provincial Council.
In terms of section 2(1) of the Provincial Councils (Consequential Provisions) Act No.12 of 1989, the powers and functions of (a) Minister or (b) a public officer under any written law made prior to November 14, 1987, in respect of any matter set out in the Provincial Council list could be exercised by
(a) the Governor or the relevant Minister of the Board of Ministers (b) and officer in the Provincial Public service holding an office.
According to the above Act, for example, while Provincial Councils implement the functions and responsibilities given in Agrarian Services Act, No. 58 of 1979, they do not have the power to implement functions and responsibilities given under the Agrarian Development Act. No. 46 of 2000 as the latter Act has been enacted after November 14, 1987.
In Alawwa v Katugampola MPCS, the Supreme Court commented on the effect and advantages of the Act. ‘In the first place it eliminates a situation where no law will prevail (in respect of matters in the Provincial Council List) until Provincial Council makes statutes, secondly it obviates the formidable task on the part of a Provincial Council to legislate virtually overnight, a mass of statutes relating to several subjects in that List so as to substitute which is already in force enacted perhaps during a long course of year.
Provincial Councils
As revealed in the analysis, there are two important matters that require consideration in relation to these Lists.
Firstly, while Provincial Council cannot make statutes in respect of any matters set out in the Reserved List, the first item in the Reserved List is the ‘National Policy on all subjects and functions’. Secondly, all subjects and functions not specified in List 1 and List 3 are brought within the Reserved List.
The residuary power is vested in the National Government. The Provincial Councils have no power in respect of national policy, even on subjects and functions included in the Provincial Council List. It is for the Parliament to lay down national policy.
The statute of a Provincial Council is subject to such policy.
It is therefore clear that Parliament retains its control on all matters and where appropriate may dictate to the Provincial Councils.
The National Transport Commission Bill is a classic example of the plenary power of the Parliament. Article 154G (1) provides that a Provincial Council may make statutes with respect of any matter set out in the Provincial Council List.
However, such legislative power is not exclusive. Parliament may also legislate on matters in the Provincial Councils List but under certain conditions.
