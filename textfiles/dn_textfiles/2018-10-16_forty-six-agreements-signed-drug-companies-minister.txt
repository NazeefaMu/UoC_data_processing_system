Forty-six agreements signed with drug companies: Minister

Forty-six agreements have been signed with drug manufacturing companies and 19 factories will commence production by next March, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
He was addressing a gathering after the inauguration of the new drug manufacturing factory at the SPMC premises.
Dr. Senaratne said that the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) had provided 1,240 million Japanese Yen for the new drug manufacturing factory opened at the State Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing Corporation (SPMC) premises at Kandawala, Ratmalana.
A total of 910 million Yen had been spent on purchasing machinery from countries such as Germany, Japan, South Korea and China, he added.
The minister said that currently, the SPMC produced 1,922 million units (tablets and capsules) of drugs annually and that the numbers would be increased to 3,337 million with the opening of the new factory.
“The World Bank will provide USD 200 million to upgrade the health services in Sri Lanka, but the issue is whether it could be used successfully with the existing public service.
The prices of 48 expensive drugs will be reduced and the charges of private hospitals will be regulated soon,” Dr. Senaratne added.
