Assessing flood disaster: Understanding problem will save lives: Wajira

Minister of Home Affairs Wajira Abeywardena speaking on the recent flood situation, in the South, said, President Maithriapla Sirisena requested to set aside political desires and prevent national calamities.
The following are excerpts of Minister Abeywardana’s speech:
“We know that many people expressed various opinions regarding the massive floods that occurred recently. Whatever these opinions are, we should first realise that this devastating flooding has brought us to an important and decisive juncture. We should understand that if we developed our irrigation systems as King Parakramabahu the Great did to preserve water in the manner “Not a single drop of rainwater should be allowed to go waste,” we would have never faced a tragedy of this nature.
Recently, in Galle, President Maithripala Serisena emphasized that all politicians should set aside their political differences, think of the country and the people and take necessary action to solve this problem without fear. We warned that if correct decisions are not made to prevent natural calamities like floods, at least at this point of time, there can be greater disasters in the future.
He also pointed out that it would be possible to arrange funds, if we work according to the correct necessary plans. Although it may be necessary to make difficult decisions in implementing these plans, he advised that such decisions should be made irrespective of power, preferential votes, or political ambitions.
As a government, we took steps to save people from similar disasters fourteen yeas ago. As the floods were not controlled previously due to protests from people, this time, water went up to 8 – 10 feet above rooftops of houses. The government is hoping to bring the affected areas and lives of the people back to normal within two months.
Floods should be understood properly
When the floods occurred, religious leaders provided leadership in villages and under the instructions of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, the armed forces and all ministries got together to save people from the calamity. If we do not properly understand this problem at least now, in ten years,’ time even 20,000 live scan be lost in the same way we lost 200 or so today.
We, as a Government, say with responsibility at this decisive point, that this flooding can be prevented completely. If the general public and politicians work together in unison with one objective, we are sure that not only the areas affected today can be protected from floods in the future, but also through that, these areas can be developed and improved.
In 2003, floods very badly affected Galle District, Matara District, a part of Hambantota District, Ratnapura District, and also Kalutara District. This time also, the people in these districts were distressed and reduced next to nothing.
The reason for this in Galle District is that we do not properly control the water in Gin Ganga. Take Nilwala Ganga and Kalu Gnaga; the situation is the same. Now, what happens when we fail to properly control the water of the three rivers is that all the water just flow into the sea without any use. On the other had, when there is flooding, it destroys everything. Our livelihood, our houses and all what we have earned in our lifetime.
Sixty-year-old reports of USA and Irrigation Ministry
At this point, I would like to remind that this is a shocking moment for the whole nation. I say this with two reasons. First, because this a terrible destruction. The other, is, even when there are clear solutions to these problems, the inability to take these solutions to the people of the country. As a nation, we should be ashamed of ourselves about this.
One main fact I can state now is that in 1960’s, it was the time when our country was called ‘Ceylon’ not ‘Sri Lanka.’ ECI Engineering Consultants of Colorado, USA, carried out a feasibility study for the then Ministry of Agriculture, irrigation, Land and Power. They handed over its report to our country in 1968. In fact, I have read the entire report. Based on the contents of that report, they have stated that if these three rivers, namely, Gin, Nilawala and Kalu, were not properly controlled in time, there would be landslips and disruptions to the lives of people. It was recommended that the three river basins should be thoroughly studied and six dams should be built.
Gin Ganga can be taken as an example. It starts from the Gongala area. It first flows through Lankagama in Sinharaja forest. Starting from Lankagama, Gin Ganga flows through its branches to the sea at various locations and at the same time, the main river falls into the sea at Gintota. As the massive run-off from the heavy rainfall over a few days could not be controlled, it has completely surged into the sea, causing devastation.
That is why we are telling these people that they should in fact, protest against the government, demanding to know when the project will be started and when they will be protected. If we do not do it, that is what will happen exactly. In Galle District, 1.3 million people suffered in 896 Grama Niladhari Divisions. In the future, suffering will be more than this.
Then there will be more landslides in Neluwa, Thawalama, Nagoda, Niyagama, Udugama, Baddegama, Weliwitiya Divithura, Akmeemana, Galle and Karandeniya. We are facing this problem as a nation that failed to properly control water.
Cultivate paddy fields and generate electricity
This is why I said that according to the report published in 1968 by ECI Engineering Ltd of United States, the present situation is very clear. There is nothing new to be done. If we can start these projects by laying foundation stones before April, next year, we all will never have to face this type of floods in the future. This is what the above report has clearly stated 60 years ago about flood-protection and generation of electricity in the three river basins of the Nilwala Ganga, Gin Ganga and Kalu Ganga.
When we look at this feasibility report, it is very clear that Jasmine Dam has to be constructed across Gin Ganga as a flood-protection system. Sixty years ago, three more dams have been proposed as Maguru Dam, Kukule Dam and Ratnapura Dam as a flood protection system. In addition to these dams, the report says that it is possible to construct power plants in Ratnapura and Galle Districts. As far as Nilwana Ganga is concerned, the report mentioned about Binghamara Dam and Hulandawa Dam. A power plant was identified for Binghamara Dam. Then there will be 3 to 4 power plants and 6 large dams. Up to now, we have failed to achieve this as a nation. This report was written before the Mahaweli programme was commenced. However, Mahaweli was undertaken successfully including Victoria, Randenigala, Rantambe, Inginimitiya, Maduru Oya, Polgolla projects and power was generated. Electricity for Galle, Matara, Hambantota and Ratnapura was brought from the above.
People should urge politicians to undertake the projects
If there is flooding at heights over one thousand feet, we will have to leave Sri Lanka and settle on Mars. We will have to leave Sri Lanka and shift to the moon. People spread similar stories when the 2004 Tsunami hit the country. Our people measured 100 ft into the land when Tsunami came. In Japan, people measured 100 ft into the sea. That is why Prime Minister and I went towards the sea with a tape to give this massage to people. New cities were created in Japan. People were settled. Today, in the world, there are hotels built in the middle of rivers. Today, in the world, there are hotels built in the sea.
I am not saying now, we should build hotels in the river or not. This one has to be decided later.
As such, the entire nation has to understand this problem properly. In fact, I hear some people saying that these floods are due to the expressway. I saw former President saying that the expressway was not done by them, but by the United National Party. It is a great thing to say like that, at least, during a time like this. We laid its foundation stone during the government of Ranil Wickremesinghe and former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunge. The then Minister of Highways Thilak Marapana, Ananda Kularatne and I laid the foundation stone. The plan was to complete this road in 2007. But by the time the road was opened in 2012, there had been additional expenditure of billions of rupees.
At the time of its opening, they said that this wonder was created by them. When the massive floods struck, they claim that this was done by the United National Party and not by them. We are ready to accept it. The truth is that we built the Southern Expressway.
There is flooding from Imaduwa to Kurundugaha Hathepma. A few new place get under water. But there’s no effect from the expressway. There is some effect in Kalutara which can be fixed. As there was the expressway, one side of it was closed by deviating from the normal rules and regulations and action was taken to help the flood victims. These areas were affected by flood even before the expressway was constructed. We have solutions for these problems.
Floods can be controlled
However, when reservoirs are built, water would not go down destroying everything on the way. Therefore, you must say things that you do not know carefully in front of the nation. As such, I do not wish to talk about this at length. But, I would like to tell one important fact. There is a solution to the floods. These reservoirs have to be built. When these reservoirs have been built, there would never be floods in these areas. We can take one example for this from Galle District. Forty years ago, the first stage of Gin Ganga project was implemented. Baddegama town is situated 12 miles from Galle. In the past, after rains, the area from Baddegama town to Iriyagaha Junction in Akeemana electorate got flooded with water up to 7 ft. in those days, people did not reside along the sides because of the floods.
However, when the Gin Ganga project was implemented, people built houses on both sides of the road. Water was controlled by an earth bund. This bund is now too old. If this bund is breached at any point of time, the area, up to 10 km or so, will be completely inundated. Thousands of people will die. Therefore, it is our responsibility to ensure proper water management is done. Water management has to be properly carried out by the government. If it is not done properly, people will suffer.
Heavy rains create massive amount of water, which is also a huge asset. The inability to properly control that asset as a Nation is really unfortunate. Therefore, I would like to remind you that our President is a former Minister of Irrigation. He is well aware of this situation. Our Prime Minister also has a good knowledge about this. Therefore, I am sure that it will be possible to find a permanent solution to this problem and that through proper water management, flooding in these areas can be prevented in the future. For this, people must give their fullest support to President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Specially, the politicians are needed to set aside their narrow political goals and work for the people at this point of time. If you support these massive flood protection projects by laying the foundations stones in April next year, we can undertake today, with responsibility, the task of completing all the works by the year 2022.”
