OMP office to be set up soon: Mangala

Measures are being taken by the government to quicken the process of establishing an office of missing persons (OMP), Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
The first ever Regional Consular Office of the Foreign Affairs Ministry was opened at the Jaffna District Secretariat premises yesterday.
Minister Samaraweera said the government was taking measures to ensure democracy, inclusiveness and development in the country.
“The government was able to release lands confiscated by the Army during the war. Establishing an Office on Missing Persons will be included in the legislation and we expect to establish the office very soon,” he said.
The minister said the draft of the new constitution is being formulated and it will seek the views and advice of all. The truth seeking commission will also be established by March. President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, taking into account the country's own past experiences had taken initiatives to promote peace and harmony among the people, he said.
