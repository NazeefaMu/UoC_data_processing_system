The oddness of Isaac Newton

There is a well-attested saying of the Prophet Muhammad to the effect that every century or so a “renewer” (mujaddid) will be sent by God to restore Islam to its proper form. The truth requires regular and forcible upkeep. From the jurist ash-Shafi’i and the philosopher-theologians al-Ash’ari and al-Ghazali to Ibn Taymiyyah, the grandfather of modern Salafism, the putative mujaddidun were thinkers who recognized that what has been revealed cannot simply be allowed to bed down into custom and ritual – it must be made new for each generation.
One of the shocks of reading Rob Iliffe’s study of Isaac Newton is that its subject fancied himself as something very much like a mujaddid. Another is that he lived in a world whose chief preoccupations would be more familiar to al-Ash’ari (and possibly even to Ibn Taymiyyah) than they would to a modern scientist. A third is that he seems to have spent more time mentally in the fourth century than in the seventeenth.
Natural philosophy
Priest of Nature is certainly not the first book to acknowledge that Newton was a deeply religious man. It is, though, one of the first to argue seriously that Newton’s faith was as important to him as his natural philosophy – if not more so. Over the past fifteen years or so a series of private papers have emerged that reveal he invested enormous industry and rigour of thought in studying Christian origins. Iliffe’s salutary achievement is to show that the writings emerging from his investigation reveal a different Newton to the man we are familiar with from histories of science. Equal parts litigator, millenarian, numerologist, moralist and paranoid conspiracy theorist, Newton probed the foundations of orthodoxy and found them wanting.
“If [these texts] had been unveiled to the Republic of Letters when he wrote them, and his authorship revealed”, Iliffe remarks in his splendid introduction, he would now be part of an elite pantheon of original thinkers who are lauded as part of a Radical Reformation or Radical Enlightenment. However, like William Whiston, his successor in the Lucasian chair [of mathematics at Cambridge University], he would have been immediately expelled from the college. He would never have had the chance to write the Principia or Opticks, and much, if not all, of his pioneering work on the calculus might have been lost.
There is no hyperbole here. This biography makes at least three important contributions to the understanding of Newton’s mind and the birth of science as it is practised today. The first is its portrait of academic life in the Restoration years, when Cambridge colleges still had more in common with their medieval antecedents than with their twenty-first-century descendants. The second is its very credible contention that Newton thought of his work as the rediscovery of the original wisdom handed down by God to prehistoric man, the prisca sapientia of the Egyptians, the Pythagoreans and the builders of Stonehenge, which had been deplorably corrupted and distorted by the early Christians.
Independent-mindedness
The third is the all-consuming vitality and venom of Newton’s anti-Trinitarianism. His clandestine, lifelong and almost entirely fruitless obsession with the subordinate status of Christ involved at least as much independent-mindedness and inference from first principles as anything he did in the sciences. In many ways it was a sort of secret prototype for Enlightenment thought: for the dogged pursuit of a train of enquiry, heedless of other people’s assumptions. Newton had, Iliffe suggests, simply “read himself into heresy”.
In many ways it is still hard to know quite what to make of Newton. He was so chary of his privacy that in spite of keeping a paper trail voluminous enough to assert his priority in using differential calculus nearly half a century after the event, he left only a few sparse scraps of introspection for future scholars to pick through. One suspects he would have preferred to be known to posterity through his achievements alone.
There is a sense of a life whose constituent parts have never quite been melded cogently together. Newton tends to come across in popular biographies as a prickly and profoundly ornery recluse whose mind was more at home in the heavens than in conversation with his fellow men, let alone women. Some of this is not exactly wrong. Newton prickled all right. Even as a child, growing up at Woolsthorpe Manor in rural Lincolnshire during the English Civil War and the early years of the Commonwealth, he threatened to set his mother and stepfather on fire and “burn the house over them”.
Modern mechanics
He was not what you would call a science communicator. The Principia Mathematica, for all its importance as the foundational text of modern mechanics, is written in a fabulously dense and sprawling thicket of Latin that makes the Greek of Euclid’s Elements look positively vulgar.
