SMS alert to prevent elephant–train collisions

The Railway Department has introduced a SMS service to save elephants. There were several reports in the recent past of collisions of elephants with trains.Under the SMS alert system, anyone who spots an elephant roaming near a railway line can immediately text the Railway control room and inform them of the situation.
Public can call on this number : 070 444 54 54. The Railway Department will formulate a system to inform an engine driver within 24hour, if a member of public informs the Control room via text message of a wild elephant nearby.
