Havelock’s and Air Force set for exciting showdown

Some top-class rugby can be expected to be dished out by both Air Force and Havelock SC when they lock horns in their first round Dialog ‘A’ division inter-club league rugby encounter at Havelock Park today, kick off will be at 6.30pm under lights.
Havies are packed with some outstanding players but they should get their act together if they are to pull off a win against Air Force. They have captain Jason Meldor, Dushmantha Priyadarshana, hooker Prasath Madushanka, Sharo Fernando, Nishone Perera, Chamara Dabare, Kevin Dixon and Dulaj Perera in their ranks, all of whom are national players. Meanwhile the experienced Air Force lads under the watchful eyes of former national coach Ronnie Ibrahim and captained by experience club player in Pushpakumara Samarahewa will know that losing their second game also could mean somewhat of a setback for them in the league tournament.
Hence they will come out with their best outfit for this game with playmakers Radeesha “Ranjan” Seneviratne and his brother in law Charith Seneviratne will go out with all guns blazing to topple Havies and create a shock win.
