Opening of Indian funded Housing Scheme by Sajith Premadasa

The Indian government has awarded us a sum of Rs. Six thousand lakhs for the construction of houses for the less fortunate and down trodden people in Hambantota district. This shows the confidence that the Indian government has about the government of Sri Lanka, said the Minster of Housing and Constructions Sajith Premadasa addressing a meeting that followed the opening of the Santhosagama Siribopura in Hambantota.
The Housing Scheme was opened by the Minister who was accompanied by the High Commissioner of India Tharanjith Sin Sandu.
Premadasa said that he opened the four hundred and seventy second Gammana in Hambantota district today and that his target was to set up five hundred housing schemes in the Hambantota district.
He said that within the next three years two thousand housing schemes will be set up in the island. A sum of Rs.233 lakhs was spent on this Santhosagama Housing Scheme.
He said that he will utilize the funds released by the Indian government for the setting up of housing schemes for those who do not have a shelter upon their heads.
The Minister said that there is a system called Panchyathi Raj in India to decentralise the power of the villages. He said that his father implemented a similar program under the Gramodaya Mandala. Premadasa said that about two years ago, a housing scheme was opened in Tissamaharama named after the Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi.
He said in future even he will obtain the collaboration of the Indian government for the progress of our development projects. There was a group of people who queried about obtaining funds from the Indian govrnnment.
I wonder whether there will be a group of people who will protest against my obtaining funds from India for the setting up of housing schemes, the Minister concluded.
