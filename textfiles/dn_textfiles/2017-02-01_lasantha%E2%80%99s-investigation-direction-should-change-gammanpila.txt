Lasantha’s investigation direction should change: Gammanpila

The investigation on the assassination of the Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickrematunge should be brought back to the right track without using it to target political opponents, said Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Parliamentarian Udaya Gammanpila. He made this observation yesterday at a press conference held at the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Head Office in Pitakotte.
He said the government has so far not questioned those who have made statements on the assassination of Wickrematunge a. He said the UNP complained that Wickrematunge was killed by four motorcyclists of the security forces.
He added that during that period the Colombo Security was under 112 Brigade Commander Major General Keppetiwalana.
