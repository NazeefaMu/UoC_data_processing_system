Closure Notice

Due to the extreme weather conditions experienced in Colombo last evening, there have been many drainage and sewerage lines that got blocked and overflowed throughout the city.
This situation has also affected the areas around the Colombo Rowing Club.
We are therefore compelled to close the club with immediate effect and will advise re-opening no sooner the CMC restores normal drainage and sewerage services.
