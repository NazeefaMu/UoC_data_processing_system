Kandy SC - a love affair with rugby

Defending league rugby champions Kandy Sports Club played with a slight difference in the opening rugby encounter of this season. But in actual fact there are no worries as with past experience this club since 1992 has been in the limelight tasting victory after victory.
Kandy SC has been playing inter-club rugby for well over 66 years since 1950. They achieved their best result in 1992, where they won the knockout for the first time. Today Kandy SC is a dominant power in Sri Lankan rugby and currently ranked third in this year’s SLRFU rugby league. The team has registered victories over CH & FC, Army SC, Police SC and lost to Air Force SC at Ratmalana which was a shocking defeat.
Kandy SC are blessed with the best squad in the country with extremely versatile players from the National squad. Out of the remaining games in the 1st Round League matches they have three vital matches two on their home ground.
Kandy’s head coach Sean Wijesinghe has wide experience, having captained the side twice, captained the National team and been an understudy to former coach Johan Taylor.
He has undergone rugby coaching training overseas with Level 1 & 2 certification.
Ably assisted by coach Nalaka Weerakody both being master strategist they should give the Kandy team the right guidance, inspiration, corrective surgery and iron out most of their weak points.
According to the Chairman Rugby Lasantha Wijesuriya the team will be at its full strength in the next three first round games against Navy SC, CR & FC and Havelock SC.
In their next game they are likely to field the same side that played against the Cops, but may make some positional changes to suit the game plan. The forwards will be strengthened to win good possession to feed the three quarters.
Every player is experienced and knowledgeable and should enjoy a very good season and come out with fine performance to help the side to emerge triumphant. On paper Kandy SC is the strongest team among the eight teams.
Since 1994 they have won the league title on 17 occasions (highest by a club) the last being 2015/16. This time they failed to maintain their unbeaten run in the rugby League and the remaining games they will look for a better performance to end the season with success like in previous years.
