Pakistan’s ‘Kashmir’ to visit Sri Lanka

Pakistan Maritime Security Ship (PMSS) “Kashmir” will arrive at the Colombo Port on a four-day goodwill visit from August 13 to 16, 2018.
Pakistan Naval ships frequently pay port calls to Sri Lanka, as both countries enjoy warm diplomatic and strong military ties. Such interactions also demonstrate both navies’ resolve to contribute towards achieving a more secure and conducive maritime environment which is essential for the regional peace, prosperity and harmony.
The PMSS Kashmir, a 94-meter MPV, displaces 1,550 tonnes of water and is equipped with state-of-the-art weaponry, communication and navigational equipment. The ship is propelled by two advanced diesel engines to achieve a maximum speed of 26 knots and has an endurance of 3,500 nautical miles.
During their stay at Colombo, the officers and men of the PMSS Kashmir will take part in various professional activities with Sri Lankan Navy.
