Wolves stay 11 points clear as top four win

LONDON, Saturday - Wolverhampton Wanderers maintained their 11-point lead at the top of the English Championship (second tier) on Saturday with a 3-0 win at home to playoff contenders Sheffield United, who finished with 10 men after goalkeeper Simon Moore was sent off.
All three goals came from the club’s large Portuguese contingent: Ruben Neves and Diogo Jota scored in the first half and Ivan Cavaleiro added the third.
Second-placed Derby County beat 10-man Brentford 3-0 to stay in the second automatic promotion position.
Aston Villa’s sixth successive win, 3-2 at home to bottom club Burton Albion, kept them only a point behind.
Cardiff City manager Neil Warnock enjoyed a 4-1 away win on his return to former club Leeds United as his side went three points clear of Fulham and Bristol City.
Hull City and Sunderland, both Premier League clubs last season, remained in the bottom three with Burton after losing to Preston North End and Ipswich Town respectively.
