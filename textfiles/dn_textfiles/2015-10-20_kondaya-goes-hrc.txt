Kondaya goes to HRC

Former convener of the IUSF, a member of the Activists for Human Rights Organisation and the Lawyers for Rights Udul Premaratne yesterday lodged a complaint at the Human Rights Commission on behalf of Dunesh Priyashantha alias Kondaya.
He was arrested in connection with the rape and murder of five-year-old Seya Sadewmi in Kotadeniyawa and released on Monday.
"I met Dunesh recently and he requested me to appear for him as the aggrieved party in the case of rape and murder of Seya. He told me that the CID did not allow him at anytime to meet a lawyer or seek legal advice. He also told me that he had never made a confession as reported in the media and he did not know anything about what happened to Seya," Premaratne said.
He told the Daily News that according to information revealed by Dunesh, the CID had severely assaulted him when he was in their custody and they had taken his signature for a confession prepared by them.
"They also did not allow Dunesh to meet anyone else," he said.
"The CID on Monday requested the Minuwangoda Magistrate to release Dunesh as his DNA report did not match with the samples taken from the scene of the crime. But they previously said that Kondaya had in detail confessed about the murder. Now it is doubtful, why they requested the magistrate to release him without taking legal action against Dunesh for misleading the police and CID if he had made such a confession," Premaratne questioned.
The Police and the CID have tarnished Dunesh's image. He has been physically and mentally affected, he said.
Police Spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara said a suspect could not be named as an accused just because he or she had made a statement to police in connection with a crime.
He said a statement by the suspect held no legal value until police investigations found evidence to prove that the statement was true.
ASP Gunasekara said: "A statement doesn't make a suspect an accused or he cannot be named as the main suspect in a crime. As the Police Spokesman, I never said Dunesh Priyashantha confessed to the crime. All he did was make a statement".
He said the police had to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt based on the evidence that had been collected and however, admitting in Court to having committed a crime can be considered as part of the evidence.
