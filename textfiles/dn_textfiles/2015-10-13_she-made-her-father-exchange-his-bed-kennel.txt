She made her father exchange his bed for kennel

A 42-year-old mother of two in Panchapitiya, Kengalle who allegedly ill treated her aged father by confining him to a kennel while allowing her pedigreed dogs to enjoy all comforts including her beds was arrested by Balagalle Police yesterday.
Police investigations revealed that the woman whose husband and mother were abroad, lived with her two children and 73-year-old father. She had said she confined the father to the kennel because he used to defecate in the bed and soil his clothing and linen.
Police found three dogs resting on her beds when they visited the home.
Her father had once worked in a leading Kandy hotel.
The father who was in a critical condition with a feeble voice was admitted to the Menikhinna Hospital. Investigations are continuing.
