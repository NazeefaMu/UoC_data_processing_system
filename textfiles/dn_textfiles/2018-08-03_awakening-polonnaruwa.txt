Awakening Polonnaruwa

A total of 180 projects were completed and vested with the public in the Polonnaruwa district, under the Pibidemu Polonnaruwa programme, launched on a concept of President Maithripala Sirisena.
The President said a giant development war would be launched in the country similar to the development projects completed in the Polonnaruwa district.
Rs. 60,000 million was allocated for the development programmes in the Polonnaruwa district.
This is the largest slice of funds allocated by any government for development work in Polonnaruwa.
Among the projects vested with the people were religious, cultural, educational and health projects completed in Hingurakgoda, Medirigiriya and Elahera Divisional Secretariat Divisions.
