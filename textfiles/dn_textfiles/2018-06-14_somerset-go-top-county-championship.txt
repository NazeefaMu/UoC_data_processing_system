Somerset go on top of county championship

LONDON, Tuesday: Somerset moved top of the County Championship as they chased a target of 248 on a tricky fourth-day pitch for a six-wicket win over Nottinghamshire.
Matt Renshaw followed his first-innings 106 with 61, before he and James Hildreth went in quick succession. But Tom Abell (46) and Steven Davies (44) then shared a crucial unbroken stand of 87 to see Somerset to 250-4.
Earlier, Notts were all out for 505 after following on, with the last two wickets adding 37 in the morning. However, their first-innings deficit of 258 after being skittled for just 134 proved to be decisive.
Australia opener Renshaw has now scored 472 runs in his five matches for Somerset, including three centuries, but his fifty at Taunton was arguably his most important innings on a turning surface.
Division Two leaders Warwickshire cruised to a fourth successive County Championship win as they beat Glamorgan by four wickets at Edgbaston.
Former Warwicks captain Ian Bell hit 115 not out, his second unbeaten hundred of the game, to steer the hosts to 294-6. Will Rhodes (61) and Jonathan Trott (67) shared solid stands with Bell.
Spinner Andrew Salter claimed a career-best 4-80, but Glamorgan pressure came too late as they suffered a third straight Championship defeat.
Prior to this game, Bell had gone 32 Championship matches dating back to April 2016 without reaching three figures.
But, having hit 106 not out in the first innings, he became the first Warwicks batsman to hit two hundreds in a match since his own previous effort against Lancashire at Old Trafford in 2004 - and this was the first time he had achieved the feat at Edgbaston.
Durham completed a remarkable 95-run victory over Derbyshire at Chester-le-Street, recovering from being skittled for just 96 on the opening day.
The home side, dismissed inside 44 overs and trailing by 109 after the first innings, set Derbyshire a target of 268 thanks to Gareth Harte’s 114.
Already reduced to 69-4 on day three, the visitors lost Callum Brodrick and Daryn Smit in the space of seven balls. Chris Rushworth ended with figures of 5-47 as Derbyshire were 172 all out.
Matt Salisbury (4-69) also starred with the ball, while opener Ben Slater was the only batsman to offer any real resistance with 68 - the next best score Tony Palladino’s unbeaten 29.
It was Durham’s second County Championship victory of the season - and the second to come in dramatic circumstances, having beaten Leicestershire to win for the first time after following-on in their history in May.
Gloucestershire’s Graeme van Buuren and Kieran Noema-Barnett shared a second century partnership of the match to earn them a draw with Kent.
The hosts, following on, started the final day 73-0 - trailing by 269 runs - hoping to avoid an innings defeat. Kent were largely frustrated but had their opponents 219-6 - 50 runs behind - with the new ball in their hands.
