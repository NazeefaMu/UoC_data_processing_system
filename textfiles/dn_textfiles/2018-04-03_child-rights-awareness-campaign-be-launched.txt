Child rights awareness campaign to be launched

The National Child Protection Authority is preparing to launch an awareness campaign about the UN declaration of Child Rights. “The Child Rights Authority had noticed the awareness level of the rural children on child rights are low and the Authority plans to launch this campaign to elevate the level of awareness of the children,” said Marini De Silva, the chairman of the Child Authority in a media statement.
“This campaign aims to educate the children about their rights in a broader scale which would give them an opportunity to use the knowledge for their future wellness. The Universal declaration on child rights was passed in the year 1989 and Sri Lanka agreed to the declaration in 1990. Therefore, Sri Lanka must protect and uphold all of the statements in the charter,” the statement further said.
A simpler version of the declaration had been created and the Authority expects to elevate the awareness levels of children living in rural areas.
The first phase of the project is to be carried out in the Western province as a pilot project. The Child Protection Authority is ready to take any and every action necessary against a breach on the declaration and urges the public to notify the Authority via calling 1929 or informing the nearby police station.
