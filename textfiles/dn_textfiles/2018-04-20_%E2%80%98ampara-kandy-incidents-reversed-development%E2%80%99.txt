‘Ampara, Kandy incidents reversed development’

Unfortunate incidents occurred in Ampara and Kandy recently reversed the country and its economy while gaining international disrepute, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday said.
He was addressing the Parliamentary Committee Meeting on ensuring communal and religious harmony in Sri Lanka attended by religious leaders.
The meeting was held at the parliamentary complex and in his welcome address, the Speaker said the committee will focus on many challenges the country face.
“Our first goal is resolve the national issues we are facing today. It is a crime to allow them to affect our future generations. We have made an appeal to all state leaders, former leaders and opposition leaders. If we fail to resolve these issues and hand over the country to our future generations, it is a grave injustice,” Speaker Jayasuriya said.
The speaker noted that the main objective of the committee is to foster unity among all races and religions of the country. “A country that is divided is bound to perish and has no future. Every country that has developed has gained stability through national unity. We need to create a disciplined country. A downfall of Sri Lankans lies in their failure to work on time. If the leaders learn to work on time, the rest of the country will follow,”the speaker said.
