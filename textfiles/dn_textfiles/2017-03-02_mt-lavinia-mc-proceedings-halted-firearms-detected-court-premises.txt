Mt. Lavinia MC proceedings halted: Firearms detected in court premises

Proceedings at the Mt. Lavinia Magistrates Court came to a standstill yesterday morning after the discovery of a bag containing two fire arms and live ammunition in the Court grounds during a security check done by Police.
A Police spokesman said a pistol of Chinese make and 10 live ammunition and a revolver with 6 rounds of ammunition were found inside the bag. There was suspicion that it had been brought by someone into the Court grounds for some planned attack. Police said they double checked the Court premises for security later by deploying mastiffs.
