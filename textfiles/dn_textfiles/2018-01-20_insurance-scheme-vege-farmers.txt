Insurance scheme for vege farmers

The Agricultural Insurance Board (AIB) has introduced a insurance scheme for vegetable farmers as per a budget proposal for 2018.
The farmers can claim insurance compensations to the tune of Rs.40,000 and they have to pay only Rs. 675 premium to become policyholders of the scheme.
The Board will contribute 81 percent, while the farmer community has to contribute only 19 percent. Insurance claims can be made for crop failures of beans, soya beans, maize, chilies and potatoes.
About 763 farmers of the Kurunegala District have registered with the scheme, Kurunegala District Small Farmers’ Association President S.M. Premaratne said at a farmers' meeting held at Bingiriya, Kurunegala on January 19.
