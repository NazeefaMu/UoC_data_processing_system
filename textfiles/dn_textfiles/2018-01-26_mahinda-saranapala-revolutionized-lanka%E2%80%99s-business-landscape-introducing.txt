The available resources were utilized very effectively. The entire team contributed to achieve these growth levels. The product range was increased which helped us to maintain our market share at sustainable levels. We also engaged in aggressive advertising campaigns, proper island wise distribution and redistribution and making the product range available to the masses.
Q Can you explain what awards and achievements you had in 2017?

This was a rare achievement winning the National Quality Gold in 2006 and 2017.Not many companies have won that twice in Sri Lanka and that shows that our quality management system is in place. Then we managed to win the APQO Global Performance Excellence Award 2017 which is a world class award, the highest one can achieve in quality, performance etc; This competition is run on the lines of Malcolm Baldridge criteria and is a very tough competition to win. Kelani Cables PLC was the only Sri Lankan Company to win this prestigious award in 2017.The award ceremony was held in Manila, Philippines in October 2017. Furthermore we also managed to win the National Chamber of Exporters (NCE) Gold award for the large scale manufacturing category 2017. We also won the B2B Category Gold Award at the SLIM Brand Excellence Awards 2017.

Q Your views about the cable manufacturing industry in Sri Lanka- challenges and opportunities
A: The cable industry has grown over the years. A few pioneering companies started 50 plus years ago in a very small beginning has grown to a staggering Rs 18 billion business annually. Today there are approximately 8 cable manufacturers in Sri Lanka. A few companies export Cables and bring in much needed foreign exchange. There are direct and indirect exporters too. The cable industry plays a very vital role in the development of our country in terms of all island power distribution, supplying cables to the construction industry, telecommunication, data transmission, lighting, hospitals and educational institutes.
Q How do you compete especially with sub standards cheap products imported to the country?
A: There are also a few substandard products that are imported by some traders and it is certainly a threat to the industry. We continuously lobby with the authorities to clamp heavy import duties to minimize these substandard products coming in to the market.
Q What are the main challenges you face?
A: The challenges are to keep abreast with new technology, high speed machinery, and innovative products. Opportunities are plenty for those venturing into the export market as the world cable market is growing annually around 8 to 9 percent. That is a massive market provided one can be very competitive in price, quality, service and delivery.
Q Your stance over impending FTAs?
A: Free trade agreements (FTA s) have positive and negative trends. On the positive side there a lot we can learn from countries like China and Singapore. If you look at China’s population it is 1.4 billion, which is 64 times our population. That’s a huge market. (Our population is approximately 22 million.)
Look at the plus points for instance Singapore with a population of 5.6 million people has one of the best global commerce, financial and transport hubs technologically advanced nation. It is also a city with best investment potential and the third most competitive country and third largest Forex market. Singapore is also the third largest financial center, third largest oil refining and trading center, with the second busiest container handling port. By these trade agreements other than trading we can learn a lot from the highly advanced countries. Other areas we can benefit will be from the advanced manufacturing, rail and road transport, shipping aviation, agriculture and health services. Negative impact will be if products that can be manufactured in Sri Lanka are given approvals to import it certainly will be a threat to the cable industry.
Q How do you view the business climate and export sector in Sri Lanka?
A: Opportunities are plenty for those venturing into the export market as the world cable market is growing around 8-9% annually. That is a massive market provided one could be very competitive in price, service, quality and delivery.
Q What trends and innovations are in store at Kelani Cables?
A: Where power is concerned we have installed solar panels in one of our factories which is a long term investment and Eco friendly initiative. Innovative products we will be introduced from time to time.
Q what are your capacity and distribution expansion plans?
A: Last year we added a highly advanced line. Another two will be installed this year. With regard to distributor expansion we will increase our distribution and dealer network on a continuous basis depending on business needs.
Q Do you engage in CSR projects?
A: We have two of the finest CSR programs conducted as public private partnerships which we started 10 years ago with the University of Peradeniya Engineering Faculty. Here we train on an average about 35 electrical technicians fully sponsored by Kelani Cables. Traditionally electrical technicians learn from the father, brother, uncle or a friend which is not technically correct. Cables deal with power, people and buildings. If improperly handled it can cause damage to people and property. So we identified that these people must be trained properly and we do not interfere with the administration as the sponsor. The university handpicks from those who pass the entrance examination and at the end of it they have to pass out and it is then that they are given the certificate. About 350 electrical technicians have passed out from both universities Peradeniya and Jaffna. Now there are some who got into the habit of learning because of this opportunity to study in the university environment they took a liking to study and enhance their knowledge. After passing out their earning capacity has gone up and some students have got into the habit of learning again. I know one person in the first batch after finishing his course did the CEI exam and last year he got a top job in Dubai with a six figure salary. That is fulfilling our hearts that we have done a CSR project which is worthwhile, has helped the community and on the other side which avoids calamities like people getting burnt and buildings catching fire. The plus side is there are people after passing out put up their own workshops armed with this certificate and some are doing extremely well. This year another 100 technicians will pass out.
Also the passed out students by forming an Alumni Association have helped during flood situations joining hands with CEB technicians, Kelani Cables and the respective PS people to check the wiring of houses that went under water, by doing the needful and giving the green light to the CEB to restore electricity. The wiring systems of over 400 houses were checked and repaired in Baddegama recently after the floods by the members of the Alumni Association, CEB, Kelani Cables PLC and the respective Pradeshiya Sabha’s in a unique CSR program.
