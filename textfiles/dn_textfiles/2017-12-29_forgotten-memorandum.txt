On a forgotten Memorandum

There is a popular belief that Sri Lankans have short memories. We were reminded of it when in perusing some past documentation our attention was drawn by chance to a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) which rightfully claimed to be of historic significance. Judging by the contents of the MoU we observed that some of those who were bound by it have forgotten what it prescribed. Let us take some examples.
According to the MoU signed on August 21, 2015 the two parties agreed to form a Government which would undertake inter alia the following: “the formulation of a new Constitution which would:
*reinforce regional representation*eliminate regional inequalities and reinforce*achieve rapid economic development*consolidate Sri Lankan identity*achieve national and religious reconciliation*safeguard inherent diversity of different nationalities and*further strengthen democracy and human rights”.
Having agreed thus, it is strange that the SLFP leaders, including a signatory to the MoU General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake publicly saying that they are against the formulation of a new Constitution. This was also in spite of their agreement to constitute the entire Parliament as a Constitutional Assembly for the drafting of the new Constitution. It is a moot point whether there is a word other than “Opportunism” to describe this strange behaviour.
The period of the MOU has already expired. Yet nothing much has been achieved with respect to the above targets. Leaving aside rapid development the economy is without a strategic orientation. The contours of the so-called social market economy does not look any different from the neoliberal model introduced by President J R Jayewardene in 1977 and continued by successive administrations. Government’s declared objectives of doubling foreign direct investments as well as the GDP in the short-term remain elusive dreams with declining foreign exchange remittances by expatriate workers, devaluation of the Sri Lankan Rupee, worsening of the balance of payments etc. Shortage of labour and capital is bleeding the economy dry and low productivity makes our goods less competitive.
Presidential or Parliamentary elections
As far as national and religious reconciliation is concerned what is discernible is deterioration and not an improvement of the situation that existed at the time of the Presidential or Parliamentary elections. Communal forces, mainly supported by the so-called Joint Opposition with ex-President Mahinda Rajapaksa at the helm have made headway among the population. Ethno-religious fundamentalist groups have sprung up and are growing in numbers, even receiving blessings and recognition from some official quarters. Untoward developments in Galle recently as well as the orchestrated attacks on places of religious worship of Muslims and certain Christian sects few months ago testify to this deterioration.
On the other hand, much remains to be done by way of providing transitional justice to those affected by the three decade-old fratricidal war. As far as reinforcing democracy is concerned draconian legislation such as the Prevention of Terrorism Act and the Emergency Regulations are still in force. The Government has also shown a tendency to resort to repressive measures to meet strikes as was shown during the strike of petroleum workers.
Despite the emphasis placed in the MoU on elimination of bribery and corruption the Government has not only failed to punish miscreants. What is worse is that the new government itself is tainted with large-scale corruption as evidenced by the Central Bank Bond scam. The much promised Audit Commission is yet to see the light of day.
The experience of the operation of the MoU clearly shows that the cohabitation of the SLFP and the UNP in the Government seems more a marriage of convenience rather than a principled union. Indiscipline inside the Cabinet of Ministers and in the Government Parliamentary Group in which the members of the SLFP and the UNP openly cross swords should have been nipped in the bud. How could a ruling dispensation which is unable to discipline its members ensure the rule of law in the country at large? Failure to do so has by its own logic led to the present impasse when both parties are at their throats during the local government elections.
Independence of judiciary
The MoU speaks of enhancing democracy. However, in the composition of the Yahapalana Cabinet of Ministers, even persons who were defeated at the polls were given portfolios after appointing them as nationalist MPs contrary to the popular mandate. The situation was worse confounded when President Maithripala Sirisena accepted the SLFP presidency and began his own experiment of its democratic transformation sans any inner party discipline.
Though independence of the judiciary has improved under the Yahapalana rule, much remains to be done still. An environment in which judicial officers could independently perform their duties requires a better environment in which vested interest groups as well as those in high positions of power cannot even indirectly intimidate them. It is no secret that demonstrations by communal forces against the operation of transitional justice mechanisms such as the Office of Missing Persons, threats of street demonstrations in case of arrest of “War heroes” or high officials of the past regime could have an effect on the judiciary. It must be mentioned that of late the class bias of certain judicial decisions has become more conspicuous. Different persons charged with similar offences have been treated differently in a manner that smacks of class bias.
The MoU is open for review now. Its signatories will be deciding to continue or end it. Ending it would be much more honourable than extending and continuing the present acrimonious politics. Time has come for the ruling party/parties to get down to the serious business of governing instead of being engulfed in inter-party and intra-party feuds. Even an end to the MoU does not absolve the President or the UNP for abandoning the January 8th mandate.
