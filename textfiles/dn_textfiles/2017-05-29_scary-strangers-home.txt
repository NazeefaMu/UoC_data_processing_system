The Scary Strangers at Home

It's 6 O'Clock, Saturday morning. I am happy I don't have to get up for another thirty minutes. I listen with closed eyes to the sound of birdsong outside my window and let my mind wander back into the land of sweet slumber...I'm almost there when something heavy lands on my back, two arms circle my neck, a tiny voice says into my ear, “Can I watch something?” What? I blink my eyes rapidly trying to understand. “You said I can watch on Saturday.” I turn and stare into the pleading eyes of my eight-year-old. It's hard to say, no. “But only 'Moana'...and nothing else, and no rewinding every few minutes, got it?” She jumps out of the bed skips towards the family room. Why not, let the TV and a movie be babysitters while I grab an extra thirty minutes of sleep? After all, TV was a part of our own childhood wasn't it? And we turned out alright, didn't we?
Maybe we did. But the reality of today is that our kids are living in an entirely different, much more complex media environment than we ever could have imagined at their age. Back then, there was only one TV station, Rupavahini, (ITN was limited to those who lived in Colombo)and broadcasting was limited to a few hours in the evening. There was next to zero children's movies ('Handaya' is the only movie I can remember watching) and computers were things we saw on Star Trek with Mr. Spoke staring at them and lifting one eyebrow at what he saw on the screen. Things have surely changed since then.
As James Stayer writes in his book, The 'Other Parent', “Unlike the children of the 1950s, 60s, and 70s, whose media choices were limited and stood out like isolated landmarks, kids today inhabit an environment saturated and shaped by a complex 'mediascape' that envelops and bombards them day and night. Roaming around TVs, internet, movie screens and electronic games kids can spend more time in this vast mediascape than in the real world- and not surprisingly, far more time than they spend in direct contact with their parents.”
If we pause to think about it, we are bound to realize that many children and adolescents today, are drawn to movies that depict violence or horror or in the case of Barbie movies unrealistic body types and a rigid beauty ideal that can be harmful to girls. It's also true that many of these same children experience negative effects of trouble falling asleep, nightmares,fear of the dark, anxiety, increased feelings of vulnerability and increased concerns about possible (and sometimes unlikely) dangers that can befall them. These negative effects sometimes last days or weeks but sometimes they can last much longer.
One area of major concern is that the line between fantasy and reality is blurred for children younger than six or seven. Psychiatrists say young children live in the magical world of Santa Claus and the tooth-fairy. The images of ghosts, monsters, human predators, bodily mutilation and blood and gore can feel just as real and can be emotionally absorbed as easily as the image and positive emotional impact of Santa.
Serious lasting effects
Even for adolescents, some movies can have serious lasting effects. It is certainly true that the amount of violence in movies and blood and gore have increased and has steadily been depicted with more detail and realism over the last 50 years. Beyond this, the horror movies watched by adolescents often contain disturbing images and situations focusing on adult themes that can cause irreparable harm to innocent minds.
According to reports on the subject, the primary reason that certain movies can be so harmful to children is that although we may know in our mind that the movie is not real, our body and our physiological responses react to the images and events as if they were real! This is why we scream, gasp, cover our eyes, and clutch our loved one. Physiologically, our heart beats more rapidly, our breathing becomes more shallow, our palms begin to sweat as if these imaginary stimuli were real. In other words, although our mind knows what is real and what is not, our body does not make this distinction. If this is true for us, imagine how hard it must be for our children to cope with this kind of 'pseudo reality' movies present.
According to a study conducted by Harrison and Cantor of the University of Wisconsin of 150 college students, directly after watching horror movies, 52% reported disturbances in areas such as sleeping or eating, as well as increased anxiety. One-thrd reported avoidance of the dreaded or depicted situation and 25% reported obsessive thinking or talking about the frightening situation. However, even more disturbing is that one in four students (25%) experienced such “lingering effects” a year or even years after viewing the disturbing movie.
In addition, these researchers found that the younger the participants were when they watched the movie, the longer lasting the effects. This was true even for those who reported enjoying the “thrill” of such movies. The lasting negative effects of horror movies also increased when children or adolescents watched these movies because someone else wanted to watch them as compared with those who sought the film out for themselves.
Quicker to attack
Research has shown that, since media often demonstrates that violent acting out is an acceptable method of problem-solving, children may be quicker to attack their problems with fists raised than with dialogue. Children tend to identify with the “cool” or heroic character; sometimes, this is the character that does the most shooting and killing, and in the end, wins.
“We’re throwing screens at children all day long, giving them distractions rather than teaching them how to self-soothe, to calm themselves down,” says Catherine Steiner-Adair, a Harvard-affiliated clinical psychologist.
Before age 2, children should not be exposed to any electronic media, the American Academy of Pediatrics, maintains, because “a child’s brain develops rapidly during these first years, and young children learn best by interacting with people, not screens.” Older children and teenagers should spend no more than one or two hours a day with entertainment media, preferably with high-quality content, and spend more free time playing outdoors, reading, doing hobbies and “using their imaginations in free play,” the academy recommends.
“If kids are allowed to play ‘Candy Crush’ on the way to school, the car ride will be quiet, but that’s not what kids need,” Dr. Steiner-Adair adds.
“They need time to daydream, deal with anxieties, process their thoughts and share them with parents, who can provide reassurance.”
Technology, obviously, is a poor substitute for personal interaction. Dr. Steiner-Adair reminds parents, “children have to know that life is fine off the screen.
It’s interesting and good to be curious about other people, to learn how to listen. It teaches them social and emotional intelligence, which is critical for success in life.”
So, come next Saturday, when those tiny arms go around my neck and the inevitable question is whispered in my ear, 'Can I watch something?' I know what to say, “Let's go make pancakes for breakfast.”
Hope it works. Fingers crossed.
