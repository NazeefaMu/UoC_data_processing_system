Nasdaq-listed Golar LNG Partners has priced its public offering of 4.8 million of shares, aiming to raise up to USD 138 million.
The company said that its 8.75% Series A cumulative redeemable preferred units, representing limited partner interests, were priced at USD 25 per unit.
The company said that distributions would be payable at a rate of 8.75% per annum of the stated liquidation preference of USD 25, adding that the offering is expected to close on October 31, 2017.
Golar LNG Partners has also granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 720,000 preferred units.
