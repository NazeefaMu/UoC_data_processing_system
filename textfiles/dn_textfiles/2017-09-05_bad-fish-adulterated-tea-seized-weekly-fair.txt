Bad fish, adulterated tea seized from weekly fair

A party of public health officials raided a weekly fair in Mahiyanganaya to check for unhygienic food and found a stock of bad fish and adulterated tea with wood dust. The fish and tea were taken to the office of the medical officer of health (MOH) for Mahiyanganaya to be dispatched for a test by the government analyst. The vendors in question were to be produced before Court.
There were about 15 public health inspectors (PHIs) called in by the MOH office for the raid on Saturday.
They were from the MOH offices for Girandurukotte, Kandaketiya, Mahiyanganaya, Meegahakivula and Rideemaliyadda.
