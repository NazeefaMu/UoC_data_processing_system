Call to withdraw amendments to LG election Act

The government needs to hold all elections under the previous system in the future as the new Local Government election system has many shortcomings. Amendments to the Local and Provincial Councils Elections brought in Parliament should be withdrawn, said Commerce and Industry Minister Rishad Bathiudeen.
He was addressing the media at the Commerce and Industry Ministry auditorium on Tuesday.
“The government has learnt a good lesson through the results of the new Local Government election system. There are many LG bodies still in difficulty to form governance and choose the Mayor and Chairman. The results had confused the people about good governance.”
The good governance government has to consider the plight of minorities as they contributed highly to bring in the good governance government. Minorities were mostly affected through this new system. The minorities wanted to bring a change in governance at the Presidential Election and General Election in 2015 as they were severely affected by the previous regime. Especially Muslims were affected in various ways, he said.
The mixed system - the First Past the Post System and Proportional Representation, has many shortcomings according to the final results released by the Election Department.
“We, the All Ceylon Muslim Congress, urge the government to give up the amendments brought to the Provincial Council and General Elections. We further urge the opposition leader and other political party leaders to look into the negative effects of the new system,” the minister said.
“We requested the government not to bring amendments to the Local Government Election Act, pointing out that the amendment would affect minority communities and minority political parties. However, the government brought it into operation. Now the country is experiencing hardships as there is no way to find solutions to the shortcomings through the Act," he added.
The minister said: “The ACMC secured 166 seats in 15 districts at the Local Government election. We had only 42 members at the last LG polls. The ACMC has grown according to the results, but the new system is not suitable to the country. Therefore, the government has to take action to withdraw all new Acts relevant to the elections, he said. Deputy Minister M. S. S. Ameer Ali, Parliamentarians Ishaq, Navavi, Abdullah Mahroof, Secretary to the party S. Subaideen, members Rusthy Habeeb, N.M.Shaheed, Private Secretary Rifkhan Badiudeen, MPC Faiz and former VC S. M. Ismail were present.
