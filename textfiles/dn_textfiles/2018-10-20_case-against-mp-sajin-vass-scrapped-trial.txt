Case against MP Sajin Vass scrapped from trial

The case filed against former Foreign Ministry Monitoring MP Sajin Vass Gunawardena for allegedly causing an unlawful loss of Rs.883 million to Mihin Lanka Airlines, while he functioned as the Chief Executive Officer of Mihin Lanka, was yesterday removed from trial by the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court.
When the case was taken up before Court, PC Shavendra Fernando appearing for the defence, submitted that the written approval of the Bribery Commissioner pertaining to the incident had not been affixed with the file, so that the hearing could not be continued.
Assistant Director General of the Bribery Commission Subhashini Siriwardena pleaded for another date and the Magistrate fixed the inquiry for January 22, to decide whether the case would continue without or the written approval of the Bribery Commissioner be affixed again.
The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed this case against the former MP under Section 70 of the Bribery Act.
The Commission alleged that the former MP had awarded a contract to a private company between June 27, 2008 and May 29, 2008, in violation of the law.
