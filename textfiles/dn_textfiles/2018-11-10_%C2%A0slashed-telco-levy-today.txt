Slashed telco levy from today

The decision of the Government to slash the telecommunication levy from 25% to 15% will be operational from today (10).
The reduction of the Telecommunication Levy will be operational on both land (ground phones and mobile phones). However, the Nation Building Tax and the Value Added Tax will remain unchanged,Telecommunications Regulatory Commission’s Deputy Director Indrajith Handapangoda told the Daily News yesterday.
 He also said that it was on Wednesday that the TRC had intimated the reduction of the Levy which was to be implemented with immediate effect.We are now writing to all Telco operators, both fixed and mobile and will be operational from Friday, he said.
Sri Lanka Telecom’s General Manager (Corporate Strategy) Prabath Ambegoda said this was a very progressive move for the benefit of the telecommunications industry, which was the fastest growing industry globally.
He said it would be only the Telco Levy which would be reduced by 10% while the NBT and the VAT would remain.
Responding to a question what the benefit would translate to, say on a Rs. 2500 invoice, he said that on an invoice of Rs. 2500, there would be a reduction of around Rs. 200 which will be around 8% with the 10% reduction of the Telecommunication Levy.
Dialog Axiata Group Managing Director and CEO Supun Weerasinghe said they too will be passing the reduction benefit of the Telecom Levy to the subscribers, in both Fixed and Mobile categories.He said total taxes which earlier amounted to around 49% , would now be reduced to around 37%.
