Largest ATM begins on Monday

Arabian Travel Market (ATM) 2017 will take place in Dubai World Trade Centre from April 24-27 and is set to be the biggest in the event’s 24-year history.
Sri Lanka will be represented by over 40 travel companies and senior officials from Sri Lanka Tourism too would take part.
More than 30,000 visitors are expected to attend the four-day show, with over 2,800 exhibiting companies, forcing organizer Reed Travel Exhibitions to open up an additional hall this year to cope with the increased demand.
Simon Press, Senior Exhibition Director, ATM, said, “the show has experienced phenomenal growth of over 70% since 2012 and this year already looks like it’s going to break all previous records. We have more than 100 new exhibitors signed up and 65 country pavilions, while we expect representation from 140 countries over the course of the event. Clearly Expo 2020 is driving growth in Dubai as the emirate aims to complete 160,000 hotel rooms in time to welcome an additional five million visitors over the course of the event.
The opening session of this year’s event will look at the role Expo 2020 plays in delivering the UAE Government’s long-term vision for economic diversification.
