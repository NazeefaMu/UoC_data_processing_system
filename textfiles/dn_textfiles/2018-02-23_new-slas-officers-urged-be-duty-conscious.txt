New SLAS officers urged to be duty conscious

Public servants have the responsibility of taking the country forward despite the many challenges faced, Secretary to the Public Administration and Management Ministry, J.J. Rathnasiri said.
The Secretary was addressing a ceremony at the Sri Lanka Institute of Development Administration (SLIDA) yesterday to hand over appointment letters to 101 new officers, under the theme ‘Ensuring an excellent public service through sound national and regional administrative systems with competent human resources’.
He said that newly recruited officers to the Sri Lanka Administrative Service have a great responsibility to serve the people as public servants. “The country and the people expect you all to do this task efficiently and respectfully.”
“State servants should not neglect the vital and pivotal role and responsibilities that come with their duty. Public servants are duty bound to serve the public, since they are paid by the public,” he said.
The new officers were recruited to the SLAS with a one-year orientation programme. They have been educated on several subjects covering good conduct in the public service.
