Why is Sri Lanka’s 7’s men’s rugby on the decline?

Opinions aired by some rugby writers on the country’s status of sevens rugby is a mere ruse as they have apparently been taken for a ride by Sri Lanka Rugby officials.
When the officials without a proper analysis say that the national sevens team has peaked to the extent of winning a medal or a trophy at an international tournament, one needs to put them into correct perspective having ascertained it’s bona fide to ensure that the readers are not deceived. It is equally important for the officials to act responsibly and not use the media as a prey to convey a wrong message to the readers. Given below are details of the overall tally of the 3 leg Asian rugby sevens series 2018 so that the readers can have a better understanding to make their own judgement.
The rugby fraternity is disgruntled and disappointed the way the national team performed at the recently concluded Asian Rugby Series.
Firstly, Sri Lanka Rugby needs to focus on the Asian region instead of competing at top international level. Have we overestimated ourselves or not assessed the reality? Sri Lanka is not competitive at international sevens due to many reasons, largely because, unlike most of the top rugby unions, we are not pertinacious in incorporating power, strength and speed into our system even to a satisfactory level.
Saw how Philippines powered their way and outplayed Sri Lanka in the scrums, rucks and on the restarts to secure the third place in the final of the recently concluded Asian Sevens legs in South Korea and Sri Lanka. The rugby history of Philippines compared to Sri Lanka was established many decades after us?
Look at the manner in which Japan, Hong Kong, Philippines, South Korea and even China got the better off their smaller made opponents during contact situations. Max Denmark, the 19 year old (former Hong Kong under 19 captain and No. 8) who played on the wing hand-off Danushka Ranjan and scored twice and kept us wondering whether the tackler (Danushka Ranjan) would recover after hitting the deck so hard? It was the combination of strength, power and speed altogether. Rugby Unions look for giants and the sooner Sri Lanka rugby understands that, the better it will be. Players like Omalka Gunaratne and Dinuk Amarasinghe are the true prospects. Power and strength is the emerging trend in world sevens rugby.
Did we have a professionally qualified High Performance personnel like Inthi Marikar working full time with the sevens squad with a time and action program before the Asian Games and Asian sevens series rugby tournaments held this year?
We need to understand that a team cannot perform well by fielding aging players even if they have the experience given the limited breathing space and minimum time for recovery.
The score margin for and against Sri Lanka in the second half is evident that Sri Lanka is lacking in its strength and conditioning levels to withstand the entire game and the two- day tournament which includes at least three games per day and three a piece.
We also need big players like Omalka Gunaratne, Anuradha Herath, Sudarshana Muthuthantri, Shenal Dias (ex Peterite now in USA), Shehan “Lema” Pathirana, Dinuk Amarasinghe, Nivanka Prasad, Sajith Saranga and Jehan Seelagama to name a few.
Regret to note that some of the players in the squad did not match at least the minimum stature of the making of an international player. Sri Lanka must start looking for big players who have time for rugby and would be eager to represent the country - it should be their number one priority. The question also arises whether the present rugby authorities have plans to give enough international exposure this year to the national players. Affording such opportunities is a learning experience to perform better and this is the only way out to narrow the gap between Sri Lanka and the top teams in reaching the target.
Going back to the final scores let’s see the gap on the points difference between the top two teams Japan and Hong Kong vis-a-vis the other teams. As far as Sri Lanka is concerned, our points difference against the two top teams Japan and Hong Kong is between 15 to 20 points way too much. Therefore our strategy should be to narrow this gap which in turn enable us to turn tables on the other teams.
The other fact is about decision making on the field. Rugby is a complicated game where the exact positioning of players at any given time on the field can change.
Every player has to make so many decisions in a fraction of a second. But we feel our national players have the speed but very little ability to make the right decisions on the field. We saw how time and again Sri Lanka’s smallest players were trying to compete against the bigger opponents at this year’s Asian Games as well as in the Asian Sevens Series. The results were really disastrous at such times!
Sri Lankan Rugby must give the players a life, a way of making a living out of the sport. Otherwise we are in danger of losing players. A player of the caliber of Sudarshana Muthuthantri fits the spot. He has the brain and brawn and always takes the right decisions on the field.
More years of rugby is left in him and the best of his is still to come. He must be earmarked and chosen to lead the team on the longer run.
Coming back to the Asian sevens series tournaments, we feel that there is no proper structures in place, and to perform at this level has now become a Herculean task.
Just because we won the Championship in 2016, doesn’t mean that we can defend the title anymore. The ground situation has changed so drastically.
To start anew, our target should be to be within the top three at the Asian rugby seven’s circuit.
At the last Sevens series held in South Korea and Sri Lanka; Philippines and China won the Plate Championship, respectively. Analyzing the performances, next year, the contested by teams such as South Korea and Philippine will be vying for 3rd place while the Plate Championship would be strongly contested by teams such as UAE and China. Hence Sri Lanka can contest to secure 7th spot competing with Chinese Taipei in an 8 team participating tournament.
Rugby sevens has brought about so many opportunities that some rugby playing nations are focusing on this short format of the game because they see it as a way forward.
At present, Sri Lanka sadly lack the vision to improve their stakes on sevens rugby. This is just one side of the coin. On the other side of the coin is the rapid progress made by other teams over Sri Lanka. We just can’t reverse back the clock to 2016 and compare the past with present.
The main factor which is pulling rugby to shambles at present is the very poor management mainly due to the lack of a proper system or synergy to channel the energies to take rugby to the next level.
Against the present backdrop, can Sri Lanka rugby get within the three top teams in the Asian sevens circuit? Nobody can simply ignore or wait without arguing the reality that the Sri Lanka sevens rugby is faced with.
When Sri Lanka came into the cup championship finals twice against mighty Hong Kong at the 2016 Asian Rugby sevens Series - mind you in foreign soil (Hong Kong and South Korea) under previous Sri Lanka rugby boss Asanga Seneviratne and High Performance Director Inthi Marikar (who has vast, experience and knowledge about how the game is played in New Zealand) we all got carried away thinking that rugby can live in the past laurels without getting to better planning and organization.
Some dreamt of Sri Lanka going on to win the Cup, but it was not to be.
Since the “brains behind” stepped down in July this year our national seven’s rugby team has fallen to the lowest since 2012 placing sixth in South Korea and even getting beaten by Philippines who were ranked way below us in the previous year in 6th spot, in the Plate finals.
The time is ripe for the rugby authorities to realize the impending disastrous state of affairs and put their act together to come out with a more comprehensive strategic plan to compete with Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Philippines, China and UAE with special emphasis given to the physical stature in the selection of players.
Our focus at present on Asian rugby circuit is fading away.
Let’s refocus on rugby and get ourselves to a paradise of the wise lot not fool’s. The truth does hurts, but it has to be told.
