Preparing the mind and living with pressure ....the new oxygen!

Sri Lanka is a remarkable nation of sport mad islanders, who spend much of their time being experts in many disciplines ...especially national selection policy and how much we should consider so and so in the team?
Rugby is the second most popular islandwide ...cricket owning that top slot... but only international limited overs cricket.
Schools rugby is no. 1 by miles on any level ...its popularity soaring every weekend as we speak ... the Royal-Thomian all the way down to the wire. Coach Lagga for STC and Martis for Royal, both master tacticians, both islanders and pretty talented players to guide. The system for all the big stables fully professional at each level.
Teams carry head coach, asst coach, backs and forwards coaches, trainer, physio, masseur, analyst at the top end ...master-in-charge and manager add to a squad of 23 players and complete the list. Home and away games are massive logistical plans to map and execute. Feast your rugby appetite for a veritable..."All u can handle" this sunny weekend:
Royal v St Joseph's, St Peter's v Isipatana, Trinity v S Thomas'.
Experts and pundits will have a field day waxing lyrical and speculating score lines, plus plenty of gnashing with all the old boys passionate about pride and their badge.
All three games promise family fans and class mates... Plenty heartache from the kick-off and lots of hydration before half time.
The schools rugby association should consider water breaks to absorb this extreme heat and not end up dehydrating players and fans alike ... Coaches and physios must insist on tanking up before warm up ...during match and rehydrate after the game.
Excellent rehydrates on the market, ...otherwise nothing better than the world champion thambili, closely followed by the more elusive kurumba ...both supplies the body exactly what it needs to revive and prep for performance all thru the 80 mins.
Coaches should weigh in and weigh out for all players...to tag how much the body and fluid loss is, on average for 40 mins.
If the temp is 35°...then the temp in the boots ...a lot greater and good to 38°?
Both teams should request for water breaks pre and post half time, and water should be provided ....plus we can also use to avoid cramp. extreme fluid loss etc ...sunstroke and many other horrible factors that directly affect performance in the middle ...plus of course the quality of the big encounter!
Good common sense must prevail and a practical alternative for junior games to be played earlier...8am starts ideal...all done by 10am perhaps.
The schools and Singer should I think, release a medical guide, a leaflet in all languages, on how to handle heat, to deal with dehydration, heat stroke and extreme fluid loss. Valuable information for all of us.
Parents need plenty of guidance about the do's and dont's of training in the sun, how to fluid up for matches etc...they also need to understand the clinical basis of supplements being handed out to their children, on a daily, weekly, monthly basis. The promise of becoming an impact power player with 3D muscles and a 5D ability, is too tempting for the kids, to say no.
Extreme gym conditioning ...is a specialist area of expertise and should be handled by qualified knowledgeable trainers...who understand the requirements of modern rugby and prepare the boys to be match ready with 80 mins petrol to burn.
Shocking loss to absorb Sajith Mallikaarachchi leaving us long before full time. We had him in our Sri Lanka 7s squad that played one leg of the 2004 World Series in Dubai and South Africa. A proud product of isipatana, national captain and Cup winner for several years with Kandy SC as player and captain.
An exceptional ability to read the game made him very difficult to gauge ...at fly half or centre...his contribution will be part of his legacy, for school club and country...respected by his fellow team members as a player who always protected and took the pressure ...control and balance his weapons in the middle. Blessings for the young family he leaves behind and may the turf lie gently on him ...knowing that he has gone to a better team and will always be loved and missed as a good friend, a great player and skills that exemplified his rare and gifted qualities as a proud islander.
The game demands absolutely everything in the middle ...with little consideration...for those who lack the performance fitness or courage to handle pressure in the middle.
Focus in every hurried shout does little for players in the scrum...or the ball from scrum half to inside centre on a miss pass for the full back to hit the overlap at pace...my mind is racing as I remember screaming for early ball and a chance to power up against my opposite winger. Little has changed!
The mind for more ...the mind for pain...the ability to withstand impact from bigger and stronger ...but still stand up and surprise the opponent. We push the limits of human tolerance in preparation ...and only a handful can graduate those impossible pain levels ...only the elite champions have the kryptonite quality... A heart so strong it defies logic, defies science and gets back up to fight till the last gasp...these are the players ...these are the flag bearers, these are the real champions that simply makes us proud and add value to our sport and life. It's the incredible nature of these amazing islanders, so humble from the hard work, that gives our active lives true meaning...and being able to surprise, certainly deserves "flipping Christmas cake" all year round. All hail the warriors.
Finally, it's for all rugby pundits and experts to try and predict what results will hit us from the Peter's-Patana game? Can Royal bounce back against Joes? Will the Trinity-Thomas game be such a humdinger in Pallekelle ...that pushes it right down to the wire?
Cheers islanders!
