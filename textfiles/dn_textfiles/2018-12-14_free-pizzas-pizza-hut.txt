Free Pizzas from Pizza Hut

Pizza Hut celebrated its 25th anniversary with an irresistible offer of 1400 free pizzas recently.
Twenty five Double Chicken and Cheese Large Pan Pizzas were given away to the first 25 customers at each outlet, which created unprecedented excitement and anticipation amongst pizza lovers.
Large crowds were seen queuing outside outlets from as early as 9 am at almost all parts of the country as they found this offer just too good to miss.
Another customer who was one of the free pizza recipients at Pizza Hut Dehiwala expressed her views by saying, “When Pizza Hut launched in Sri Lanka, it was the single best place to meet up with friends and have a good time,so we didn’t miss a single opportunity to visit and taste their delicious pizzas.”
Having formed an unbreakable rapport with the Sri Lankan customers over the past 25 years, Pizza Hut looks forward to creating many more delightful moments and memories with them in the future. So let’s raise a slice to another 25 years with Pizza Hut.
