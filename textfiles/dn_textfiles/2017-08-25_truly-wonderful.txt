Truly Wonderful!

Kingswood Drama Culture ensures that their thespians receive a comprehensive knowledge of Drama. These boys learn of the realities in society and its light and darkness. Their productions such as ‘Everyman’, touch on adult themes such as ‘God’ and ‘Death’. Dramatic Moves feature the Dramatists of Kingswood who receive an all- round knowledge on Drama.
Teacher in Charge Chathurika Niyadagala pointed out that there is no better motivator than Drama when it comes to producing an all-rounded character. She points out that it is a good foundation for a stable personality and the students acquire soft skills such as language, discipline and team spirit. Stage phobia vanishes through experience.
She points out that there is never a dull moment. The boys are lively and there are tons of climaxes and only a teacher can understand how really wonderful it is.
Challenging
“We have to train the selected characters to get the best from them. But as they are children, it’s a challenge for us to get the real emotions out. We could achieve this by training them regularly -the scenes, gestures, facial expressions, changing the scenes, voice controlling, actions. But time restrictions have been a bit of a challenge. I always encourage my little gentlemen reminding them to be honest with what they do and do their best. And if they try, they can achieve their goals,” said Niyadagala
Team work is the main thing she points out. This is especially true in a stage drama where each character is bounded with the others success, it’s not an individual item. So you must be aware of this to put out a really good production. The boys have always had it within them. They were the judges of their friends acting, and they criticized each other so they could correct their weaknesses.
“Performing a stage drama is not an easy task at all, whether it’s a comedy, tragedy or a moral play. It has to be authentic, you must be confident and you must make sacrifices. Dedication is important. I must mention our dear Principal, who always encourages us along with the Deputy Principal Madam and Deputy Principal Sirs, the teacher in charge of the English unit, for their support given to uplift the drama unit,” said Niyadagala
Meaningful experience
Dramatist Yashodh Ellepola spoke about Drama as a deeply meaningful experience. A very psychological experience.
“For our English Day Performance we did a production called ‘Everyman’, it was written in the 15th century and it shows that human nature can change. The protagonist goes from the happiest guy on the planet to basically an emotional wreck! That shows us how fragile the human mind is! When I got into the skin of the character I felt like him even off the stage! I remember I was involved in the character so much, that a tear came out of my eye! It was amazing. I was really shaken! As the play went on the character evolved into someone who was calm and gracious. It was amazing because you get to know the character better than yourself! I have no words to describe it! The character becomes you!” said Ellepola
A large part of the success of ‘Everyman’ is due to the talent of the boys. Ellepola’s ability to adapt and change character is remarkable. He goes from a psychopath to a very nice guy. His portrayal of these two extremely different people is proof of his talent and his adaptability of the roles. Ellepola who says he is extremely social, took around five days to get into the skin of the character. Working as a team he says it has its share of hardships. But balancing all their studies and activities, the boys pull through.
Drama has definitely benefited Ellepola’s life off stage. He has learnt how to control and balance his emotions. He has built up his self –esteem. He revels on stage, calling it an awesome experience. All in all Drama has been a real life changing experience for him. He is forever ready to push his limits and raise the bar.
“Doing Drama is very important to the life of a student. It teaches you how to behave in society. You can actually learn that from doing drama. You learn how to behave with people. I remember one of our actors was bitter to the very end. He was really negative saying – ‘I can’t do this I can’t do this’, but in the end he became confident and enthusiastic. It bring out what you need in Society,” explained Ellepola.
Ellepola is also an announcer and Drama has helped him with his voice. As mentioned above Ellepola is passionate. This passion for tragedy comes from the fact that he appreciates the deeper themes and realities of life.
“I like doing tragedies – the sadness and the betrayal of the moment! I really like that. You don’t get that anywhere else! It is only in Drama! I am so passionate I am also sometimes the character off stage. Totally submerging yourself in the character is one way of learning your lines and putting up a good performance,” pointed out Ellepola.
Learning new things
Dramatist Damsara Liyanage is a young man who is blossoming into the competent thespian he will be one day. A young man in a stage of transition he is growing in confidence every day. Liyanage who has not completely overcome his stage fright is working on it and proves there is no such thing as Instant noodles and Rome was not built in a day.

“One thing I have gained through drama is control over my emotions. We have had so much fun working with each other. Our teacher helps us a lot. Initially on stage I was frightened and shocked with the judges in front of me. For me I have gained a lot of things through drama. I improved my English but still I must confess I have not quite overcome my stage fright! But by practicing I grow a little stronger day by day,” said Liyanage
The competition in the Drama circuit is of a very high standard and I see some really good performances. Losing that pressure for me is only a matter of time, as time goes on I am able to pull myself together and get my act together.”
Really thrilling!
Dramatist Prabash Weerathunga Arachchi feels that it is this hunger to perform that keeps the boys in drama. It is fun and enhances your personality. When in the proper frame of mind Arachchi is able to deliver a classy performance. His frame of mind is not easily shattered. A young man with self –assurance he does not trouble his mind too much about a production realizing that at the end of the day he and his team mates will emerge Victorious.
“Drama has really developed my linguistic skills when it comes to English. When you are on stage and people are watching, it is really thrilling. To get over stage fright I put chairs in a row and pretend they are people and shout out my dialogue to them. If we consider a typical student, he can improve his social skills by doing drama. It boosts your self- esteem. I am able to get into the proper frame of my mind and make up my mind that I can deliver a good performance. So I have that self- assurance.
When stepping into the skin of a character first you need to understand his emotions and personality. Is he a person who is essentially good or bad? What kind of qualities does he have? You need to do your homework.
Doing ‘Everyman’ has made us hungry for doing more dramas. We want to do more and more dramas. Because it has really boosted our self- esteem. We are ready to take on more risks and challenges. It is a bit scary getting up on stage and acting the role, if you don’t obsess about it too much I don’t think it will affect you very negatively.”
