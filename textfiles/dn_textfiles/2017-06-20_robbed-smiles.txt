The robbed that smiles


Somewhere in the outskirts of this very same city, a bank robbery is about to happen. A young man from a lower middle-class family suddenly crashes into a bank. But the robbing is not going to easy. A lot of distractions stand in his path. A relationship grows between the robber and the bank staff to an extent of calculated intimacy. Later the police were to enter followed by the media crowd.
That leaves the audience in a shock!
You won’t simply be able to make head or tail of what is taking place on the stage, enshrouded in fantasy. Because Kapila Kumara Kalinga likens it to the fantasy that rules us all: to rob a bank.
What happens on Kalinga’s latest stage play, Banku Weeraya, is not what is supposed to take place in a usual bank robbery.
“Everyone wants to rob a bank. We may not actually walk that fantasy, but we certainly need money more than we earn. Most of us live only half. If we only can rob a bank, we think we can live a full life,” Kalinga notes, taking a hint from the consumerist order marked with a full-throttled chase behind money.
The presence of media adds a touch of humour to the breakdown of scenes. The media can craft heroes out of villains, Kalinga remarks. Whenever a criminal incident happens, the crim receives full publicity free of charge. Their crimes are exposed in graphic details, offering free lessons to would-be successors.
The bank robber, starred by Dharmapriya Dias, is questioned by the media as to why he wanted to rob a bank. To leave the country, comes the reply, with the money robbed. I love Sri Lanka, the villain turned hero responds, but Sri Lanka does not reciprocate that love.
“That is the typical idea that we live with. We all love this country, but we think that this country does not return our love. I am trying to build up that argument through seven characters,” Kalinga clarified.
Kapila Kumara Kalinga has been engaged in a slow-pedalled voyage as a copywriter and a writer. He left the theatre territory 15 years ago. He makes the re-entry with Banku Veeraya to a new audience which he segregates into two main schools.
One school is about 50 percent of people who do not have the slightest idea of what theatre is.
“You can easily please them with light comedy that runs for about half an hour. We have so called dramatists catering to that crowd. I do not approve of it,” Kalinga remarked.
The remaining 50 percent, on the contrary, would not easily fall for light entertainment. Kalinga is optimistic about this crowd. Though few in numbers, they are omnipresent in the society. They include university undergraduates, teachers and other commons with some intellectual capacity.
That changes as we move towards outstations, Kalinga hastened to add. The 50 percent goes down to about 25 percent. The majority just want some light entertainment to please themselves. They are not bothered about what they will be as they leave the theatre.
Kalinga’s mission is to reach out for the optimistic percentage and increase its volume.
In Sri Lanka, Kalinga sees a tradition of theatre. It is a tradition that passes on from one generation to another. The contemporary dramatists offer a flicker of hope to Kalinga.

“Our theatre has a bright future, though we cannot expect the whole 10 million to come and watch. It does not happen anywhere in the world.”
But Kalinga’s worry is something else: why should some dramatists try to force something on the audience just for the sake of more commercial gains? A vendor cannot go on selling substandard items. Arts should be brought to the fore from such plains, Kalinga recapped. His worry rests with the percentage that is not optimistic.
“They have messed up the performance with dramas. They just need to watch some play about half an hour and laugh. They are not used to longer dialogues and durations. This should not happen.”
Then what should happen? The spectator should leave the theatre for a higher philosophical pedestal, and see life in a different perspective. That objective is not achievable as long as dramatists produce plays of inferior substance just for the sake of keeping up the theatre tradition.
Kalinga is more into the serious entertainment industry as a scriptwriter. But the industry suffers from a severe dearth of scriptwriters. The performers, producers and directors steal the show with budding artistes clinging on to that plush position. But the upcoming scriptwriters are rarely – if not, never - heard of.
“This is simply because we do not have time to chill out, hence no time for reading. That is why we do not get to hear about brilliant writers.”
Then what is Kalinga’s way out?
“My first principle is watching, if you are writing for the screen. You need to watch and learn. But the stuff available for reading is so much. We won’t be able to finish them off in this birth itself, probably. But then again, we can choose our favourite writers who write good stuff and study them repeatedly,” Kalinga reiterated.
That’s Kalinga’s job which he does in a raised podium. It should have been impossible if producers in the calibre of Priyankara de Silva (of Sadaya Marai Salli Hamarai fame) are not ready to take up the gauntlet of bucking the trend against commercial trends of the local theatre. Interestingly, de Silva is also professionally nestled in the banking sector. Despite his links with finance sector, de Silva has lent his generous hand to the country’s theatre industry for the past 15 years.
Banku Weeraya will be staged at Western Aesthetic Institute (NADA) on June 25 at 3.30 and 6.45 pm.
