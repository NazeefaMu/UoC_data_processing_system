‘Voice  of Image’ moments

‘Voice of Image Exhibition for Dialogue’ was held recently at the Lionel Wendt Theater. An initiative of Center for peace building and reconciliation (CPRB) and young creativists, VOI is an exploration on bringing young people, visual art and social change under one initiative. It utilizes the medium of photography to connect human wellbeing and ecological wellbeing.
Photographer Jayanth Dharmawardhana and peace builder Dilshani Jayaweera designed and developed VOI along with cpbr team in the hope of creating a space for youth to voice their views through images. Pictures by Shan Rambukwella
