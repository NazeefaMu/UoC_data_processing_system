Matale political stalwart to join UPFA in LG elections

A political stalwart in Matale is due to join hands with President Maithripala Sirisena on January 29 and support the United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA) at the forthcoming Local Council election. He would be appointed as the Mayor of Matale in the event the UPFA wins the Matale MC election, UPFA candidate and SLFP Matale District organiser Ujith Anuradha said.
Anuradha said this particular political stalwart would join hands with the UPFA at an election rally held under the patronage of President Sririsena at Matale on January 29 to ensure a UPFA victory.
He added that according to the present trends, the UPFA is likely to emerge victorious in all local councils in the Matale district at the forthcoming election.
