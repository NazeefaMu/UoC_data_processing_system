This is to be used for the proposed fund raising of the Bank. Further to the announcement made by Sanasa Development Bank on the Trading Floor of the Colombo Stock Exchange on December 16, 2016 in relation to the Proposed Fund Raising contemplated by the Bank, the Subscription Agreement between International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Bank for the issue of 3,647,500 Ordinary Voting Shares of the Bank by way of a Private Placement at Rs 140 per share amounting to a total investment of Rs 510,650,000 was executed on February 17,2017.
