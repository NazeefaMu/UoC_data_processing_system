Vying for Elfdom

A student determined to become a real-life elf has showed off the results of his latest surgery which includes a vampire-style hair transplant using his own blood.
Luis Padron became obsessed with the world of elves and angels after being bullied as a child. The 26-year-old underwent a hair transplant with specialist injections earlier this month in Beverly Hills in California, USA, to help further his dream of becoming a fantasy being.
The procedure that combines implanting over two thousand hair follicles and injecting him with stem cell platelet rich plasma will give him a ‘widows peak’ and stimulate hair growth.
So far Luis has spent a whopping £36k trying to achieve his dream, but has at least eight more procedures planned.
Luis became determined to look like his favourite otherworldly characters and sourced inspiration from films including Labyrinth and The NeverEnding Story.
To look more like an elf, Luis started bleaching his skin and hair and now he has a £4,000-a-month ritual applying specialist creams, dyes, treatment and SPF100 sunscreen.
He splashed out on surgery including liposuction on his jaw, a rhinoplasty, full body hair removal and operations to change his eye colour.
Luis, from Buenos Ares, Argentina, gets stared at for his unusual look but says he doesn’t care what people think and that he won’t stop until he has fully transformed into an elf.
He’s planning surgery to make his ears pointed, hair implants for a heart-shaped hairline and a limb lengthening op to make him 6ft 5.
Luis, who sells cosplay merchandise, said: “I want to be an elf, an angel and a fantasy being, my aim is to look inhuman, ethereal, graceful and delicate.
“I have my own beauty ideal and want to achieve that no matter what. I want to have my ears cut to become pointy like an elves, my jaw to look more sharp like a diamond, a facelift and an eyelift to give my eyes a cat-like shape. I am also consider having muscle implants too. There’s also a surgery to make you taller and I will remove four of my ribs too, so that I can shape my waist to make it thinner. People have stared at me ever since I was a teenager, so it’s very normal to me now. I like people staring at me and don’t care what they think,” he said.
“Even when I’m not dressed up like an elf people stare at me. I have had long white hair for five years, I use larger contact lenses and I am very tall. I use make-up to enhance my features so they are more angelic and wear clothing that’s more stylish or antique. I consider myself trans-species, in the same way transgender people feel, I need to become how I feel inside, I don’t expect people to understand but I ask they respect it. The fantasy genre makes me happy and because I didn’t have many friends when I was younger I submerged myself into it.”
Luis fell in love with the fantasy genre during his early teens, while struggling with bullies who mocked him because he dyed his hair and had different dress sense.
But by the end of high school, Luis claims his quirkiness led to him being admired, which further fuelled his longing to be different.
He added: “I was bullied as a child and as an escape I would submerge myself in fantasy movies like Labyrinth and The NeverEnding Story, as well as other fantasy tales. Over time things changed, older teens liked me because I was unique and that’s what encouraged me to start turning what I felt on the inside into a reality. I started with cosplay but it wasn’t enough, I wanted to change to become my own perception of beauty.”
At the age of 14, he was determined to undergo surgery to look more like an elf and six years later he went under the knife for the first time.
Luis said: “It was the start that led me to decide this was the direction I wanted my life to go in, the recovery was painful and slow but I was happy with how I looked. I didn’t care for how much it hurt, because it allowed me to get one step closer to my dream of what I want to become.”
In his question for fantasy perfection he continued to have over 40 fillers, full body hair removal, laser skin bleaching to remove any freckles and Botox.
