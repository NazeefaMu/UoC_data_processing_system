Early detection, best cure

The lung cancer is gradually gaining ground in Sri Lanka. Diagnosed late, and you will have a little chance of survival – probably two years at the maximum. Diagnose it early, and you will have a bigger chance of braving the cancer. In an interview with Health Watch, Consultant in Clinical Oncology and Radiotherapy, Dr. Mahendra Perera (MBBS, MD, Dip. RT) elaborates on lung cancer, its causes and preventive measures. Dr. Perera is also the President of Sri Lanka College of Oncologists and Chairman of the Board of Study in Oncology and Radiotherapy in Sri Lanka, He is also a member of European Society of Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology and the Principal Investigator of Clinical Trials, NCIM.
Q: What is lung cancer?
Dr. Mahendra Perera
Q: What are the main symptoms of lung cancer?A: Malignant growth in the lung tissue, mainly the bronchial epithelium and the alveoli. Lung cancer could be divided into two categories: primary lung cancer and secondary lung cancer. Primary lung cancer arises directly from the lung. Secondary lung cancer comes from another body organ and gets stored in the lung.
A: There are many symptoms: 
1. Prolonged cough. 2. Coughing out blood, 3. Unusual shortness of breath 4. Voice changes 4. Chest pain. 5. Arm pain 6. Unexplained loss of weight 7. Continued fever. 8. Muscle wasting 9. Skin pigmentation. 10. Diabetes insipidus. 11. Bone pain 12. Head ache and fits 14. Loss of appetite 15. Leg vein thrombosis. 
Q: Who are at the risk of developing lung cancer?
A: 1. Heavy smokers.
2. People exposed to pollution. 3. Workers in chemical and dye industry. 4. People exposed to asbestos. 5. Certain viruses. 6. People exposed to radiation. 7. People with genetic disorders.
Q: What are the treatments available in Sri Lanka? 
A: 1. Early cancers could be dealt with surgery. This involves resection of part of the lung or even may be removal of the whole lung.
2. Chemotherapy. 3. Lung cancer vaccines. 4. Radiotherapy.
Q: How we can prevent it?
A: Lung cancer is not a preventable disease. There are many causative factors that we are not aware of yet. We can only reduce the risk of getting lung cancer by avoiding carcinogens such as smoke, dust and chemicals. It is extremely important to detect early by recognizing the above symptoms. Any person who has a long lasting cough that does not respond to treatment or any person with coughing out blood, loss of weight etc has to be investigated by a medical specialist.
Q: Can low quality fuel, air fresheners and incense sticks lead to lung cancer?
A: There is no proven evidence.
Q: What is the survival rate?
A: Lung cancer remains one of the most fatal cancers. Early detection is difficult most of the time and many cases are late at presentation. It can mimic many non cancerous conditions. Patients with primary lung cancer have a poor prognosis. Only 30 or 40 percent can survive even two years at least. Many symptoms surface late and the victim would succumb to it within a few months. A few would survive for maximum two and half years with treatment. Most lung cancers are treated with the hope of giving symptom-free survival. Secondary Lung cancers are treated in a different way. The main treatment depends on the area where the primary cancer was. Their survival depends on the primary cancer and the available treatment modality.
