World Suicide Prevention Day commemorated

Sumithrayo commemorated World Suicide Prevention Day at Independence Square amidst a large gathering. Many questions were directed to the panel of eminent persons who participated in the discussion. The panel included Dr.Razia Pendse, WHO Representative in Sri Lanka, Thirupathy Suveendran, WHO Colombo, Dr. Velauthapillai Jegaruban, MOH, Govt. Addiction Centre, Killinochchi Hospital, Dr. Neil Fernando, Senior Consultant Psychiatrist and U.R. De Silva, President of the Sri Lanka Bar Association.
The keynote address was by Dr. Razia Pendese who spoke about the significance of the theme “Take a minute and change a life” and articulated on how communities could contribute by reaching out to people in distress. She also detailed why some people have suicidal feelings and what signs we must look for in a vulnerable person.
Well-known theatre personality Indu Dharmasena shared his thoughts on why people who are distressed must seek help and why communities must also be sensitive and reach out to vulnerable people. Among the other speakers were Subodha Pilimatalawe from Seven Media Group who spoke about the digital campaign “We Can” where celebrities speak openly about depression and Ornella Gunasekera, who narrated her own story of how she overcame depression. The Rotary Club of Sri Jayewardenepura University staged a short, interesting skit that centered around - ‘Taking a minute to change a life.’
A pertinent fact that emerged from the panel discussion was that various web sites that quoted suicide statistics in the Internet, still ranked Sri Lanka as No. 4 in the world when actually we should be between No. 20 to No. 24 with 16 suicides per 100,000. This is expected to be rectified soon when WHO statistics are updated. The WHO also offered assistance to monitor and record attempted suicides in Sri Lanka to obtain a clearer picture. U.R. De Silva commented on the need for helplines such as Sumithrayo to be indicated at the end of the reports on suicides.
The event concluded with participants lighting candles in memory of those who had lost their lives, according to a news release.
