Exploring  the endless  opportunities

Composure and professionalism are key to her success as a leader. Perfect Prefects features Head Girl of Ilma International Girls’ School Maryam Mubeen, who believes in making a difference by accepting others and believing in them.
Mubeen points out that self-belief can make a difference in anyone’s life, opening up so many avenues.
“Young people today need a role model who has managed to achieve his or her aspirations in spite of adversities. For example Khaled Hosseini migrated to the US as an Afghan Refugee at the age of 15, knowing no English at all, several years later while practising medicine, he released his first best- selling novel, Kite Runner and today he is an author of four books, what we understand is there are no limits to what someone can achieve, because the possibilities are endless,” said Mubeen.
Smooth connection
Mubeen and her fellow prefects are thoroughly professional. On duty, it is all about work. Off duty, they are just friends.
“My secret to success is my coordination with my board of prefects and the guidance of family teachers and seniors. With each person on my board I have a smooth connection, so we share opinions very freely, duty is professional but off duty, we are great friends. And that I believe prevents a lot of misunderstanding and miscommunications that could occur,” explains Mubeen.
Mubeen points out that her school brought her out of her shell. This was inevitable when responsibility was placed in her. She had to rise to the occasion.
“Looking back on time, I see myself as socially anxious and introverted. Over a year ago when I became house captain I had to break free of my shell, a hundred new people with a hundred new viewpoints and a hundred mistakes to learn from. Change is inevitable and today all credit goes to my school for making me an independent, confident and sociable person. I am who I am today because of my school,” said Mubeen.
Being ethical is a quality she values highly. It wins you friends and supporters because they trust you.
Gender equality
“As a Muslim, the leader I admire is Prophet Mohammed, for his humility, courage and support of gender equality. Being ethical is what is important and that makes people want to work with you, and that gives way to success,” said Mubeen.
Mubeen feels we must break out of cultural restraints and women, in particular, must realize their potential.
“I want to change the way the world sees women. Today in most developing countries, women do not have the means to educate themselves, nor do they have a proper solid profession in most developing countries. This is because of cultural restraints mainly, so by taking the initiative, I want to inspire all the women to unleash their potential, and discover their skills and become leaders in society,” points out Mubeen.
Mubeen has so many dreams such as being a Marine Biologist, Gynaecologist and a UN Activist. Her talent and hard work no doubt will help her achieve her dreams.
“I have many dreams. Being a marine biologist is one, being a Gynaecologist is another. The former because of my passion for oceanic studies, the latter because I want to also serve my community. I want to make a difference in the world. I want, to inspire women to do something for themselves. To show the world that they are independent. And along with those, my other dream is to be a UN activist for peacemaking,” added Mubeen.
Various hardships
There are so many people in this world who are undergoing various hardships. Most of what we take for granted in Sri Lanka they don’t have. There is such suffering in the world.
“The problem other people my age are facing in other parts of the world concern me. The war in Iraq and Syria, hunger in Africa and racism in America. And here in Sri Lanka, we have a bustling life in Colombo, peace in the suburbs, beauty in the borders. The difference is massive. I want to bring a change to the lives of all people, who have not seen what we see every single day,” said Mubeen.
She also laid emphasis on the importance of technology saying that it is a powerful driving force in the world today.
“I like exploring traditions and meeting new people. Everyone is different so the experiences are never-ending. Technology is mind-boggling. I like discovering my own skills at it because it is something that is vast and massive in the whole world and that is what is taking the world forward,” stated Mubeen.
The world would be idyllic if we just accepted each other. However, this goal is not unachievable. We just need to accept others and look beyond our differences- our shared humanity.
Positive attitude
“Patience and composure are key. From my own experiences, I say, if people accepted others differences there would be much fewer problems in the world,” said Mubeen.
You need to think of life positively. Life will come with its challenges. You need to have a positive attitude.
“De-stress by doing what you love to do. Preferably something aesthetic like travelling and painting and thinks about the good that will come in the end instead of bothering about the hurdles,” stated Mubeen.
She is secure in the belief that everything in life happens for a reason and seeks advice when faced with an obstacle.
“Firstly I would assess the gravity of the obstacle and decide whether the stress I feel is compatible with the weight of the obstacle. So after ruminating I would talk to my peers and get their advice because when you have everyone’s opinion, you can weigh out the pros and cons and decide on the solutions we need in order to overcome the obstacle. Patience and composure are key and believe that everything happens for a reason, keeps me going,” stated Mubeen.
