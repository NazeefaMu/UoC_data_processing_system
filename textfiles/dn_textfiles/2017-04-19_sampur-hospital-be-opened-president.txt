Sampur hospital to be opened by President

The Sampur Hospital currently being renovated and constructed is to be declared open by President Maithripala Sirisena on May 7, said the Provincial Health Minister A.L.M. Nazeer.
Nazeer told Daily News that the Eastern Provincial Health Ministry took immediate measures to upgrade the hospital as a District Hospital and to rectify the shortcomings of the hospital by renovating and constructing new buildings for the benefit of the people.
The people of Sampur have experienced immense hardships due to the lack of proper medical services due to the poor infrastructure facilities available at the hospital.
The Provincial Ministry having identified the shortcomings took measures to address these issues. The Provincial Ministry will continue to develop the hospital further, said Nazeer.
The Provincial Health Minister together with relevant officers visited the hospital to inspect the progress of development work recently.
