CR rally in 2nd half to beat Air Force 21-9

CR&FC scored a hard fought 21 points (2 tries, 1 conversion, 3 penalties) to 9 (3 penalties) win against a fighting Air Force outfit in their Dialog 'A' division Inter-club League Rugby Tournament match played at Air Force ground in Ratmalana yesterday.
Both teams had their moments in the game and CR produced two tries and that decided the victor in the end.
The match winner for CR was fly half Tharinda Ratwatte, whose contribution was an amazing 11 points, which came off through three penalties and one conversion. Air Force’s chances were kept alive through the boot of Charith Seneviratne who slotted in three penalties.
CR & FC had to struggle somewhat in the first half with Airmen drawing ‘first blood’ with an early penalty by centre Charith Seneviratne and went in to a 3-nil lead.
Soon after the Red shirts equalled scoring to 3-all through a penalty booted by Tharinda Ratwatte.
Air Force stretched their lead with a well-taken penalty by Seneviratne to make it 6-3 which was the score at half time.
After the breather CR brought play into the Airmen’s half and succeeded in crossing the line through the efforts of burly second row forward Charana Chamikara with the help of granite hooker Supun Warnakulasuriya. Ratwatte converted the try to grab the lead for the first time 8-6. Seneviratne slotted in a penalty kick minutes later to take back the lead 9-8.
CR clearly had the edge over Airmen in the second half where Ratwatte slammed a penalty to hand CR the lead again 11-9.
The Red shirts increased their lead to 18 points to 8 when they were awarded a penalty try by the referee and Ratwatte was spot on with the conversion.
Air Force played with a big heart but not retaining the ball and giving away some penalties during the end didn’t help their cause. CR sealed their victory with a penalty put over by Ratwatte during injury time.
Referee: Akhil Jamaldeen had an excellent game with the whistle.
