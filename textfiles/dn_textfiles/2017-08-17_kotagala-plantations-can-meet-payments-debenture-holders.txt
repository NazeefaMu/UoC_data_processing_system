Kotagala Plantations can meet payments to Debenture holders

Kotagala Plantations has notified that certain contributions to the Sinking Fund securing the Debenture issue for Rupees 1,000,000,000 made by the Company in 2014 have not been paid in the manner stipulated in the Schedule to the Trust Deed, thereby resulting in a deficit.
The Company is currently evaluating multiple options available in respect of bridging this deficit, and intends on making good this shortfall during the course of the next three months.
The Company hereby confirms that it has demonstrated to the Trustee as at date its strategies and action plans in respect of the above, and the Trustee is satisfied that the Company has resources to meet all future payments to the Debenture holders in respect of interest/principal, as and when they become due.
Notwithstanding above, the Company confirms that all interest payments to the Debenture Holders to date have been made on time, and wish to assure that future interest payments will also continue to be made on time.
Furthermore, the Company confirms that the downgrading of the credit rating of the Company (as per Corporate Disclosure dated 25th May 2017) will not have an adverse impact on the repayment of the debentures, and assures its Investors that all repayments on maturity will be made in a timely manner.
