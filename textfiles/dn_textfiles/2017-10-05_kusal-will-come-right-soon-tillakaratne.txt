Kusal will come right soon - Tillakaratne

 DUBAI, Wednesday: Batting coach Hashan Tillakaratne said that it was only a matter of time before Kusal Mendis, one of the most exciting young finds for Sri Lanka would start to make the big scores that he is capable of.
Mendis in recent innings has had a lean run that in his last eight innings in Tests and ODIs he has failed to pass 50. His last innings of note was the hundred he scored against India in the SSC Test.
Mendis was even rested for the fifth ODI against India to allow him to recover mentally as he had been playing continuous cricket since his Test debut against West Indies in 2015.
“I think he is a talented young guy. Just that he got hundred against India and he is working hard and he will come back strong. We are working on his back foot play and leg side play and he is a very keen student. I am sure they way he is working he will come right,” said batting coach Hashan Tillakaratne.
While Mendis has been struggling to find his form another young exciting cricketer Niroshan Dickwella is showing maturing in his batting in comparison to his approach during the Indian series.
“It is very pleasing to see someone adapting to the condition so well and he is one of the top players for Sri Lanka. He has improved his batting zone well and he is a very keen student and he is performing very well,” said Tillakaratne.
“He is very talented and skillful and we don’t want to change his game but the first few 50 balls it is very important and after that it is upto him to play his shots”
Tillakaratne said that he
was pleased the way the Lankan batsmen ran up a total of 419 in the first innings in trying conditions.
“We had a good batting plan and all the batsmen batted according to it. There is no guarantee when you got to bat that all the batsmen can get a hundred or a fifty but partnerships were very good,” said Tillakaratne.
“It was very pleasing to see skipper Chandimal getting a big score and showing the other players how to do it.
He has been working very hard the last few weeks and it is pleasing to see him get 155 not out. Dimuth 93 and Dilruwan and Dickwella also contributed.”
Sri Lanka will be making their debut in a night Test and playing with a pink ball for the first time and Tillakaratne said that everyone was looking forward to it.
“It is something new to us, we did have a net at Khetterama. How much the pink ball defers from the red depends on the condition. At Khetterama it moved a bit, here we have to wait and see.
“We watched Pakistan playing against West Indies and the ball did not do much and it was a good batting track,” he said.
