Sports Minister puts to shame able athletes
Para athletes did immense service to country without facilities - Mustapha

Minister of Sports Faiszer Mustapha said that Sri Lanka’s para athletes who won 14 medals at recent Asian Para Games in Jakarta were a good example to able athletes.

The Minister made these remarks at the felicitation ceremony held at Duncan White auditorium for the para athletes yesterday.
He further pointed out that our para athletes won 14 medals including four gold’s with lack of facilities but able athletes who went with a contingent of 175 did not win a single medal at the Asian Games.
“I am not scared to talk about reality, with a lack of facilities para athletes did immense service to their country whereas the able athletes having all the facilities failed to do so. As a Sri Lankan we should appreciate their performance,” Minister Mustapha said.
Sri Lanka finished with four gold, six silver and four bronze medals and secured 14th place in the medals table out of 43 nations. China dominated the table with 161 golds, 83 silver and 55 bronze while Iran and Korea secured second and third places.
Sri Lanka also dominated two track events by clean sweeping them for gold, silver and bronze. This is first time in Sri Lanka’s sports history that so many medals were won at a games conducted by the International Olympic Committee.
