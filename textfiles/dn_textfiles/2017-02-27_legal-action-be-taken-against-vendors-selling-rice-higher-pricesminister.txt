Legal action to be taken against vendors selling rice at higher prices:Minister Bathiudeen

The Commerce and Industry Ministry will file legal action against 1,300 out of 1,900 vendors who sold rice at higher prices.
Commerce and Industry Minister Rishard Bathiudeen said that action would be taken against the vendors who sell rice above the stipulated price and rice unsuitable for human consumption.
The Consumer Affairs Authority has deployed around 200 officials to conduct islandwide raids and they will conduct raids on a daily basis to nab errant traders who sell rice at higher prices.
The CAA officials have conducted 169 raids in Pettah on February 24 and 25 and seized 3,590 kilos of rice unsuitable for human consumption from 63 shops so far.
