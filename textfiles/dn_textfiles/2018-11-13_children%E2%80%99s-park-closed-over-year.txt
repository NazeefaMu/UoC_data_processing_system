Children’s park closed for over a year

The Senanayake Chidren’s Park at Medawachchiya has been closed for over a year.
The park had previously been closed for repairs; however, it had so far not been reopened, even after the renovation work was complete.
A Medawachchiya Urban Council spokesman said that the reopening was delayed as there were plans to construct a fence around it.
