A PROPER WASTE MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR URBAN AREAS

Solid waste is the term generally used to describe non-liquid waste materials from domestic, trade, commercial, agricultural and industrial activities. Growth in population and industrial activities in most developing countries has led to over exploitation of natural resources which are highly related with waste generation. Two types of solid waste are composed of Biodegradable solid waste and Non- Biodegradable solid waste.
In urban areas in Sri Lanka, solid waste is generated through a wide variety of sources including commercial enterprises, industries and households. These problems are now most severe in urban areas in Sri Lanka. Hence, the availability of proper waste management methods is crucial to minimize the waste problem. Concerning incorporate management activities associated with generation, storage and transport processing of solid waste in an environmentally sound manner.
At present, although there are solid waste management systems in the cities in urban areas, 90 percent of the waste generated is disposed into the dumping areas illegally. Due to the lack of collecting vehicles and political interference, the authorities concerned do not properly pick up waste throughout the country. In addition, the people follow the easiest way of throwing garbage on the streets without using the garbage bins. The tourist hotels, guest houses and cottages discharge remnant food wrapped in polythene sheets and some enterprises also discharge packing materials such as plastic, regiform in the same manner. The discharge of solid waste destroys the natural beauty of the environment. The informal disposal of solid waste has become an acute social problem spreading diseases throughout the country. The foregoing problems highlight the comparative need for a regular proper waste management method in combating pollution in Sri Lanka.
At present there is no proper solid waste management plan and Local Government agencies grapple with the waste problem with a poor budget, thereby leading to incomplete cleaning, collection, disposal and burning of waste materials. This shows the incapability and irresponsibility of solid waste management. An awareness campaign aiming at the general public has to be launched in resolving the ever-increasing solid waste problem.
Educating the public on waste management
Major specific objectives must include proper methods and peoples attitudes towards a solid waste management plan to minimize waste problems for the urban areas. Proper methods include identifying major impacts of improper disposal of solid waste, identifying private sector involvement in solid waste management and identifying the following wastes, solid waste comprising non-liquid waste materials from domestic, institutional, market, medical and commercial source and streets and garden wastes (food, paper, cardboard, vegetation, rubber, leather, discarded clothing). Also include packing materials (plastic and glass) and cut pieces from garment factories.
Urban solid waste includes all waste collected and controlled by the Local Authorities or Municipal Councils other than sewage that is residential waste, commercial and market refuse, institutional refuse, street, sweepings, construction and demolition debris and any other municipal waste.
The household garbage and rubbish category comprises waste as a result of household activities including food preparation, sweepings, cleaning etc. In developing countries like Sri Lanka, this category largely consists of kitchen waste, paper, glass metal and plastics.
Commercial and market refuse consists of waste from stores, offices, hotel and markets. This waste typically consists of packaging, container materials, used office supplies and food waste.
Municipal solid wastes are non-hazardous waste disposed by local communities. They have to deal with collection, disposing of what most of us offhandedly call trash, collection of cans, bottles, food scraps, newspapers, lawn clippings and old furniture that characterizes everyday living. Institutional refuse category involves a large portion of paper rather than food generated from schools, government offices, hospitals, police barracks and religious buildings.
Street sweepings category of waste includes dirt and litter containing an appreciable amount of household refuse, drain cleaning and animal manure. Most of the street sweepings include kitchen waste and paper because the primary method of refuse waste is the placement of waste on the roadsides.The composition of solid waste is similar to that of rural towns in Sri Lanka. More than 80 percent of waste materials is bio-degradable, tree cutting and other garden waste constituting the major share.
Solid waste management means the handing process of solid waste materials from generation to its disposal. From generation to disposal a clear material flow can be identified. They are generation, storage, discharges, transportation and processing and final disposal.
Proper National Waste Management Strategy
Then a successful management should include management activities associated with the above mentioned process and the final disposal of treated waste in an environmentally friendly manner. In Sri Lanka, local authorities have the responsibility of managing waste and organizing the collection of waste for its areas and delivering them to the point of disposal.
The National Waste Management Strategy (NWMS) should involvewaste avoidance, reduction, refuse and recycling and final disposal in an environmentally sound manner. (Ministry of Environmental & National Resources, 2002). The National policies should be aimed at reducing waste by consumers through education and awareness creation. The present rate of waste generation can be reduced to a considerable extent by sound housekeeping practices. Reducing the demand for packaging systems adopted by the consumers by means of deciding their own disposal problem at source and the problems associated with the final disposal, can bring about a reduction in generation of such waste to a considerable extent. A consumer should be encouraged to use biodegradable packaging materials as much as possible and manufacturers encouraged to reduce unnecessary packaging to facilitate environmentally friendly disposal systems. This in turn will reduce their production costs.
As set out earlier, the solid waste generation in urban and rural areas presently remains at a very high level caused by unsuitable transportation processes and poor storage facilities for vegetables, fruits and other perishables. These perishable products become waste products in the market places owing to inefficient handling and current packaging systems. A proper post harvesting marketing chain system should be developed with appropriate technology to avoid or minimize the generation of waste. A new strategy should also be developed in reducing the plastic and non-biodegradable waste in the packaging sector. Otherwise, this remains an environmental and health problem in the country. In the absence of well established plastic waste recycling facilities, these problems will be accentuated in the future. Hence, the use of plastic should be controlled as much as possible in preference to paper, glass, cloth and other biodegradable materials.
The consumers should be encouraged to reuse the products in question for some other use in an environmentally sound manner without disposing it at once. (Ministry of Environmental & Natural Resources, 2002)
Recycling of waste
Recycling of waste enables to reuse the waste to a considerable extent, thereby making final disposal manageable. Sustainable waste collection systems should be established in order to make recycling economically viable.Most of the solid waste in the form of biodegradable waste, makes it suitable for composting. It has been found that incineration is not economically viable.
Hence, composting of organic waste should be given serious attention by the local authorities concerned, owing to the high prices of the chemical fertilizers and the associated health problems with the overuse of chemical fertilizers. The farmers should be encouraged to use compost produced by organic waste as a soil conditioner. However, it should be noted that the quality of the compost would depend mostly on the degree of contamination and the type of the organic waste. Plants and animals have a tendency to use heavy metals in this respective systems, which is a significant risk to food chain crops. So, Sri Lanka should have heavy metal standards for compost. Segregation of waste by source plays an important role in producing compost of a better quality. With a view to augmenting market for compositing, arrangements should be made through the authorities concerned in stimulating the agricultural sector to use compost as a soil conditioner.
Ceylon glass company uses 42 percent of waste glass in the process of production, the company has facilities, up to 60 percent if waste glass is available. Use of broken glass enables Ceylon Glass company to reduce the production process when waste glass is used. The amounts of raw materials required for glass production can enable saving of material resources.
The existing technology in Sri Lanka in the process of paper production equipment should be improved upon to use various types of paper waste. There is a paramount imperative to formulate policies to make optimum use of the available waste.
