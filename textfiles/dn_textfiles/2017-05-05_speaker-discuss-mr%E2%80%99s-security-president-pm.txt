Speaker to discuss MR’s security with President, PM

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday observed that he would discuss the matter of security of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa with President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and keep the House informed regarding the matter.
The Speaker made this observation in response to a privilege issue raised by Joint Opposition Parliamentarian Dinesh Gunawardena on the alleged reduction of the strength of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
The Speaker also added that he would discuss the matter with Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka.
MP Gunawardena said that the former President’s security was cut down by 45 personnel on the following day of the May Day Rally.
“Former President Rajapaksa said there are threats to his life and therefore removing his security was dangerous,” MP Gunawardena said. “. “I have already had discussions on the matter with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesnghe and Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayaka . Therefore, it is important that the former the President’s security is guaranteed”.
Speaker Jayasuriya responding said he would inform Parliament about the matter after discussing same with the President and the Prime Minister.
MP Dullas Alahapperuma at this stage said the former President has a greater threat than TNA MP M.A. Sumanthiran who has also received death threats. “If Sumanthiran has threats from the LTTE, Mahinda Rajapaksa would have a thousand fold more threats from the LTTE remnants”, the MP observed.
Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake said increasing or withdrawing an MP’s security is not a healthy trend.
“If the decision has been taken based on politics it was not fair and could not be acceptable,” he said.
