SL to participate International  Tourism Expo in China

Sri Lanka is being invited to participate in one of the largest tourism events in Asia, Guangdong International Tourism Expo in China from September 7 to 9.
International Chamber of Commerce President, Kosala Wickramanayake said that they also hope to woo the Western Province council and even Colombo Municipal Council members to attend this event along with other stake holders of the industry. He said that Guangdong has a very high per capital income and the citizens in the province like to travel to Asia. “There are also good air links to Colombo from China which is also another advantage.”
