[Parliament]-23.10.2015

The domestic mechanism to probe human rights violations will subject to Parliament approval, Skills Development and Vocational Training Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said in Parliament yesterday.
Participating in the adjournment debate, the minister observed only the hardliners of both sides reject the UNHRC Resolution adopted at the recently concluded sessions.
He urged the MPs not to seek political mileage by using the Resolution as a political slogan, adding that the country is at a critical juncture at the moment. He noted the decisions taken today would affect the future of the country and the national unity.
"Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, Karunanidhi and the Tamil Net website have rejected the Resolution stating it is advantageous for the Sri Lankan government. They have rejected the Resolution. Some sections in this House too ask to reject the Resolution. It is seen all of them are on the same page with regard to the Resolution," he observed.
"The Resolutions which followed that in 2012, 2013 and 2014 were consequences of not implementing the promises made in 2009. However, we have got another chance now and we must make use of it. Sri Lanka is a Multi-ethnic and multi-religious country. The rights of all groups must be protected to prosper reconciliation. The President is undertaking this task with the consultation of all political parties. Therefore there is nothing to agitate about this process," he noted.
He also pointed out that the Presidential Commission reports must be presented in Parliament to make the reports content available for the public.
Megalopolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said political consensus is essential to move towards long lasting peace and reconciliation.
He further said the duty of crafting a domestic mechanism is upon Parliament, adding that any such mechanism should give priority for truth seeking. He observed the special court must come under the judicial system of the country. Ranawaka said the confidence on the judicial system has collapsed and observed independent judiciary must be rebuilt.
The minister reiterated the healed wounds of the past should not be examined as it would impact negatively on the existing peace and reconciliation. JVP MP Vijitha Herath taking part in the debate criticised the government for agreeing to co-sponsor the US backed resolution stating it affects negatively to the country's sovereignty. "What the US has is a strategic motive and it has no genuine concern for the national unity of Sri Lanka. The US need not intervene in the constitutional matters of our country. However, the resolution has referred to the 13th Amendment and devolution of power.
The government should make sure that the real victims of war are meted out justice by the steps initiated," he said.
Ranawaka said the joint statement signed by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and UN Secretary General Ban ki Moon in 2009 marked the beginning of the problem and added some politically bankrupt elements are trying to use the UNHRC resolution for their survival.
"Prof. G. L. Peiris was a key figure behind the devolution package in 2000 which risked the country's security. He was also referred a 'Package Pappa'.
"Now he is talking of protecting the motherland by assuming positions in the new Movements. He played a role in signing various international agreements containing harmful clauses to Sri Lanka.
He should be responsible to the existing problem," he said.
The minister said former government led by Mahinda Rajapaksa obtained the support of international representatives to the Paranagama and Udalagama Commissions.
"British National, Desmond Silva is still paid 55,000 pounds per month. However, the reports compiled with their consultation were not made public by the then government," he said.
Kuragala historic site predates Vijaya's arrival - PM
The Kuragala historic sacred site has evidence to prove that Sri Lanka's civilization goes back to pre-historic times, as far back as more than 8,000 years. Hence, the excavations would be done without giving rise to any kind of ethnic tensions, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
He made these observations yesterday in response to a question raised by UNP Parliamentarian Buddhika Pathirana, for oral answers.
The Prime Minister said there were problems with the Buddhist sites in Kuragala, but there is an excavation site near an Islam religious place and discussions will be held to conduct the excavations without any issue.
He stated that the research on history and excavations would be conducted on the instructions of Prof. Deraniyagala and added that they will be commenced in March next year.
The Premier said the civilization runs far back than the Prince Vijaya's arrival.
At this stage Buddhika Pathirana thanked the Prime Minister for his directions. Meanwhile, JVP Parliamentarian Sunil Handunnetti requested the Prime Minister to take measures to renovate the Bellana Road which leads to Balangoda where the "Balangoda Man" lived in the pre-historic ages.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe in response stated he would take special interest on this issue. He added that the same road was of great importance as it is believed the same road has been used by those people of prehistoric ages to go to Horton Plains to find food.
Opposition MP Sarath Amunugama said that it was commendable if the Kuragala excavations were done without creating reasons for an ethnic conflict.
At this stage opposition Mahajana Iksath Peramuna Parliamentarian Dinesh Gunawardena stated that the Sripada Sacred Site has been subjected to grave injustice due to the demarcation and delimitation of provinces.
He requested the Premier to take corrective measures as Siripada is one of the most sacred places for Buddhists. At this stage the PM said he would also attend to the matter.
TNA fully support govt in implementing UNHRC Resolution - Sumanthiran
The TNA extends fullest support to the government to implement the UNHRC Resolution in full, TNA MP M. A. Sumanthiran said in Parliament yesterday.
Participating in the adjournment debate, he observed that the TNA welcomes the passage of the resolution despite certain clauses in it had been weakened following negotiations.
"This is your resolution. You co-sponsored it. However, we are more keen than you for its full implementation. Now the UNP and SLFP have agreed to implement it even without the international participation.
You cannot be selective when it comes to the implementation. The Foreign Minister has accepted the promises given by many successive governments had not been kept. People must see action to have faith on the government. Let the people really feel it.
Then we can stand collectively in the international arena. No doubt these are difficult issues. We are willing to go that difficult journey with you.
The resolution has not only highlighted the crimes committed by the Sri Lankan forces, it has many revelations on the LTTE atrocities. Yet we welcomed the entire report, we are ready to lead our people in the painful process of introspection. If we are to move forward, we must be prepared to do it," he said.
Sumanthiran criticized the statements of several MPs that they would create a Sinhala State, adding that these remarks invite further divisions.
"No doubt Sinhala community has a glorious past and dignified heritage, but I do not belong to that community.
"I have my own cultural heritage which have an equal glorious past. When you say you want a Sinhala State, then we are pushed to seek our own. You are the separatists, not us. However, I am glad that MPs who hold such views are few in number. Many spoke about sovereignty. Sovereignty is the right of people to rule themselves. That does not mean it can be exercised by some people. This has been the problem of this country. A particular group superior in number cannot have the sole authority of exercising powers. Every citizen has equal rights. The issue initially arisen because we were excluded when formulating the 1972 Constitution. The issue of discrimination came later," he observed.
He stressed whatever the mechanism the government is going to follow it must earn the confidence of the victims as a just mechanism.
Referring to the Paranagama Commission, Sumanthiran said its mandate should be terminated forthwith, stating it has no credibility. "However, even such a bad commission could not escape in saying Channel 4 video did not seem to be fake. Therefore it has proposed to conduct an independent inquiry. Let's deal with the investigations justly, honestly and transparently without sweeping them under the carpet.
That will elevate our national image in the world. Do not give in to the extreme views of both sides," he added.
Lankan Judiciary capable to hear cases against security forces
The Judiciary in Sri Lanka is capable enough to hear cases within Sri Lanka against the security forces. There is no need of international intervention or support, Opposition Parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa said in Parliament yesterday.
He also stated that Sri Lanka has enough experiences in doing so. Weerawansa pointed out that Sri Lankan judiciary had heard on Premavathi Manamperi murder, Chemmuni murder, Krishanthi Kumaraswami murder etc. The MP said that if the government thinks it needs to strengthen the judiciary, it could do so and hear those cases.
He made these observations yesterday joining the adjournment motion moved on the government co-sponsored resolution at Geneva in Parliament.
Weerawansa said that the government side members attempted to point out that it was only during Mahinda Rajapaksa regime a resolution was moved against Sri Lanka before the United Nations.
He stated that the after the 1983 Black July, a resolution was moved against Sri Lanka at Geneva. The parliamentarian said that this resolution attempts to say that our security forces have committed war-crimes.
He questioned as to why the Prevention of Terrorism Act needed to be removed and added that it was to release terrorist suspects held in prisons.
Weerawansa said that this is not an achievement but an act of betrayal.
Govt to revise Penal Code
The government will revise the Penal Code to criminalize hate speech, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Minister D. M. Swaminathan yesterday said in Parliament.
Participating in the debate on Geneva based UNHRC report and alleged human rights violations during the last phase of the war, the minister said: "During the period 2014-15, 112 incidents of hate speech against Muslim community had been reported. There were 22 such incidents since January this year. Christian groups reported 126 incidents targeting Christians and their religious sites, 57 since this January."
"There had been no prosecutions in relations to attacks by the Buddhist group, Bodu Bala Sena on the Muslim community in Aluthgama in June 2014 where four people were killed and around 80 injured," he said. The minister said that the government yet to embark on any comprehensive process of demilitarisation. Local civil society sources recorded 26 cases of harassment and intimidation by military and intelligence services in the North and the East during January to August this year.
This figure highlights the reality that the structures and institutional cultures that had been created by the repressive environment of the past remain in place and will require much more fundamental security sector reform.
"Under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which has long provided a legal context for arbitrary detention, unfair trials and torture remain in force. According to the civil society sources from January to August, 19 persons were arrested and 12 still remain in custody. Although the government has engaged in a dialogue with Tamil Diaspora groups, it has not yet taken any step to delist the numerous Tamil Diaspora organisations and individuals from a list of terrorist organisations.
"The security forces and intelligence services have enjoyed near total impunity and have not undergone any significant downsizing or reform since the armed conflict. The military retains an oppressive presence in the war-affected areas of the North and the East by occupying private land and maintaining a culture of surveillance and harassment of the local population and civil society," the minister said.
Previous govt. whipped up Communalism
JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti told Parliament yesterday that the previous government whipped up Communalism after the war victory.
Organizations such as BBS which acted with state patronage created problems for the Muslims during the previous regime.
The MP speaking in the debate on Geneva based UNHRC report, said the government should not allow anyone to create racial tension in the name of religion.
Although MP Wimal Weerawansa says the Prevention of Terrorism Act should remain, we see no need for the PTA in a country that has no conflict. Some people who are in the political wilderness are depending on Communalism for their survival.
Exclusive Sinhala state will create Tamil state - Senadhiraja
If there are demands for a separate Sinhala State, there will naturally be a demand for a separate Tamil state as well, TNA Leader Mavai Senadhiraja said in Parliament yesterday.
He said that setting up of an exclusive Sinhala State would automatically help lay foundation for a Tamil state. Then there will be an international assistance for this.
NFF Leader Wimal Weerawansa addressing a political meeting held in Colombo recently has called for the setting up of an exclusive Sinhala Buddhist community. If there is a need and urge to create such a Sinhala State it would be inevitable to see the creation of a Tamil state too.
We would seek the assistance of the international community and create a separate Tamil nation.
The country has not recovered from a war and the Tamils are still at the receiving end, the MP said that there was no other solution except the Hybrid Court mechanism proposed by the UNHRC to move forward. Tamils would get a fair deal only through transitional justice.
It is our belief and the standing point.
TNA MP Shivashakthi Ananda said due to deficiency in the domestic judiciary mechanism, we do not have any faith in a domestic mechanism.
There should be a fair investigation on the alleged human rights violations during the last stage of the conflict.
SLFP now pursuing consensual politics - Dilan
A few in the UPFA dragged the SLFP to an extreme racist line during the past few years, Highways State Minister Dilan Perera said in Parliament yesterday.
Participating in the adjournment motion, the minister said the SLFP had never trodden a racist line, but certain people in the UPFA, dragged the SLFP into that line. He said the present stand of the SLFP is that it would never give into communalism again.
"The SLFP is now pursuing consensual politics. It is because we want to find a lasting solution to the national question. Now we saw both Wimal Weerawansa and Mavai Senathirajah criticized the resolution. It signals that they are on the same path with regard to it. The domestic mechanism will be pursued under the laws of the country. Isn't it what we have wanted? Why shout against it? During the Rajapaksa government, friendly Muslim countries gradually detached from us. I was the very first to raise my voice against the BBS. The BBS criticized me harshly in return," he observed.
Referring to the 13th Amendment, the minister stated it is also a part of the Constitution adding that all are bound to implement it.
"The SLFP always had favourable views with regard to the 13th Amendment. The instruction to implement it needs not come from Geneva. Let us accept the reality that the Geneva Resolution is actually watered down. It had not accessed anybody in person. We have to put an end to the practice of always criticizing the moves of rival party. We have suffered a lot due to this. Let us make a collective effort to solve this problem," he added.
Former regime kept commission reports under wraps
Justice and Buddhasasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe told parliament yesterday that the previous government kept the report of the commission headed by retired Justice Nissanka Udalagama under wraps for nine years since 2006 breaking the promises given to the international community.
Due to promises made to UN Secretary General Ban ki Moon, the former government appointed Maxwell Paranagama Commission and retired Justice Nissanka Udalagama Commission to probe alleged human rights violations and disappearances in the post war period.
But none of these reports was released which increased the suspicious of the international community.
But we released both these reports to prove our transparency and good governance to the world, instead of whipping up communal tensions. If we implemented the recommendations of these reports in the past, the country would have progressed much further.
Minister Rajapakshe speaking during the debate on UNHRC resolution, said the former government stirred racism and also "sold" the electric chair to get cheap advantage at previous elections.
However, the people of this country could not be deceived all the time and they gave a fitting reply on January 8 and on August 17. Many foreign leaders have told us that they thought such a transformation would not have happened at least for another 20 years. We have been able to achieve a great victory at the UNHRC sessions as the international community appreciated steps taken by the government to address human rights concerns. The government was also succeeded in averting the electric chair, an international investigation and a hybrid special court in the resolution passed there.
We have been able to save the country from the international black list of war crimes.
The world was divided on this issue, but last month, we all came together to resolve the issue for the betterment of Sri Lanka.
If someone is trying to sabotage the ushering of peace to this country, future generation will curse such people.
It was former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who initially invited foreign representatives to come to Sri Lanka for an investigations. In 2003 Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe refused to sign the Rome Convention. But due to the joint statement signed by former President with UN Secretary General Ban ki Moon, our country was subjected to international probes.
Former President signed this without even informing Parliament and his own cabinet.
So, the best person to answer all these questions, is former President.
We hope he would attend the House today or tomorrow, and answer all these issues.
Eventhough former regime appointed LLRC committee, they did not implement the recommendations of the committee as promised.
There was also no real freedom in the country eventhough the war ended. The UNHRC third resolution was not on the alleged war crimes itself, it was based on the Rathupaswala shooting and the killing of prisoners.
The UNHRC was about to take stern action against us due to these reasons. Now the world has accepted our efforts of reconciliation and that is why it was possible to bring this collective proposals.
'Last regime responsible for HR issue going global'
Provincial Council and Local Government Deputy Minister Karunaratne Paranavitharana said in Parliament yesterday that the previous regime should be held responsible for taking the human rights issue to the international forum.
The former government thought that there would be no international investigations and they also did not go ahead with the domestic investigations. They also thought if a vote was taken at the UNHRC, Russia and China would have come forward to assist us. But these countries did not help any other country facing human right allegations. We should rectify our shortcomings and go ahead as a civilised society. International community went against us because of the alleged human rights violations. We must rectify our mistakes. This government should not bow down to those raising communal tensions.
The Deputy Minister said so participating in the debate on Geneva UNHRC report.
