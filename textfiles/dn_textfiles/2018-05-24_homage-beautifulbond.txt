HOMAGE TO A BEAUTIFULBOND

 
Premayanam
Raagayen thora 
Sanda Eliya sae Achinthyai
Paarishuddhai
Suramyai…
(Love is Eternal 
It treks far beyond mere lust
It glows like a celestial being 
It’s pure and soothing)
 
Nanda Malini renders her haunting voice to the above song to portray the pure meaning of love which is unselfish and compassionate.
This blue planet we inhabit is called Magul Sakwala (lustful world) because it has human beings and animals that constantly yearn for love and lust. Though lust or desire makes living beings drowned in Samsara, love has a deeper meaning as depicted in the above song.
There had been great lovers in this world from olden days. Rama/Seetha, Radha/Krishna, Saliya/Ashokamala, Shah Jahan/Mumtaz Mahal, Romeo/Juliet kept undying remembrances of love in our minds.
True love always associates with sacrifice. The great sacrifice made by Princess Yashodara towards her beloved Prince Siddharth in his path to Enlightenment stands tall in human history.
Lady portrayals
Prof Sunil Ariyaratne throughout his film career has endeavoured in shedding light on the plight of women. Anupama, Kusa Paba, Uthpalavanna and Paththini are good examples. Yashodhara being his newest cinematic creation too revolves around a woman’s true love and sacrifice towards her man. Yet Yashodara is different to his other cinematic creations in regard to many aspects.
Producer H D Premasiri of Sarasavi Bookshop fame is a resourceful film producer keen on promoting quality cinema. Association of H D Premasiri and Prof Ariyaratne has garlanded Sri Lankan cinema with a jewel of a film, which is Yashodara.
The characters of Siddharth, Yashodara, Devdath and Channa in the Buddhist history rest within our minds eternally.
Hence bringing these characters into life credibly via a cinematic creation is not an easy task. In fact, it is a task that leaves the filmmaker with great risks. Prof Ariyaratne has boldly faced this challenge. From the stage of casting for the cinema, he has brought serious thought towards the project. The cinema speaks for itself.
The director has made emphasis on the romance between Yashodara and Siddharth. This romance begins from the day Siddharth chooses Yashodara as his bride at the Svayanvaraya.
Beyond wide screen
Finding an actress for Yashodara’s character would have been a tall order for the director since the whole cinema focuses on Yashodara and all other characters revolve around her. Indian actress Pallavi Subash Portraying Yashodara simply makes us forget that we live in a different epoch. She lives in the character so well that we forget we are watching a cinema.
Pallavi Subash magically takes us back to the era of Siddharth and Yashodara. The faint images of Yashodhara, Siddharth, Rahula and Channa filtering through a mesh of tears to the mind of the viewer become a rare visual experience. The cinema is awesomely emotional thus a sensitive person would feel like crying aloud.
Yashodhara chanting Narasimha Gaatha to prince Rahula while painting Buddha’s picture is the climax of the whole cinema. The yearning of the audience to have a glimpse of the Lord Buddha becomes enormous here. When Rahula eagerly looks from the window his face gleams with happiness and at that instance, we paint our own visuals of the Buddha in our minds.
Prof Ariyaratne has brought his thoughts and philosophy into the cinema in a subtle manner.
The director makes Yashodara cry her heart out on hearing her son Rahula’s conversion to a Samanera by the Buddha without her knowledge. She weeps here in the most helpless manner and communicates of an injustice.
Facial expressions
In another scene, an associate tells Yashodara that Janapada Kalyani is in deep sorrow after hearing Prince Nanda her fiancé has been made a Buddhist priest by the Buddha. Facial expressions of Yashodara in this scene would be best understood by women.
Heeding to King Suddhodana’s plea and as a respect towards it, Lord Buddha eventually imposed a Shikshapada forbidding converting any child to a Bhikkhu without the former’s parents’ consent.
In the shores of Anoma River when Prince Siddharth removes his hair, we see the Himalayan Mountains in the backdrop. But Prof Ariyaratne has shot the whole film in Ranmihitenna, Hambantota. The Paathra (bowl) moving upstream as a result of the Sathya Kriya by Siddharth too is shown credibly. This is the magic in special effects and hats off to Chatra Weeraman for handling it well.
Maara Parajaya (defeating death and recreation) by Prince Siddharth is shown cinematically. However, not showing the failed temptations by Thanha, Rathi and Ranga on the verge of Siddharth attaining Nibbana is a drawback.
Evil existence
Some quarters including the clergy say that there are no such characters as Mara Doowaru (Daughters of Death) and these three depict the lustful feelings that haunt one’s mind. Yet a respected Buddhist priest preached these characters really exist and they are with Maara Divya Puthra aka The God of Death. This priest also preached Devdath and Ajasat even at this moment of time dwelling in the ugly depths of hell suffering for their misdeeds towards the Lord Buddha.
We humans interpret ‘Time factor’ in a relative manner and that was reiterated by Einstein centuries after the Buddha.
Prince Siddharth showcasing his prowess in combat amongst relatives and peers would have been shot in a colossal manner. What the cinema shows is a mere combat between the Prince and Devdath and it hampers credibility of this particular happening.
Also, it is questionable as to why the director avoided Kisagothami and her singing of Nibbutha Pada to Siddharth. Did Kisagothami have a crush towards Siddharth, was a question in my mind from schooling days?
Character portrayals 
The character of Channa, the closest associate of Prince Siddharth has been given due attention in the cinema. The actor who portrays Channa (Shammu Kasun) has to show his emotion only with expressions most of the time and he does it really well.
Devdath (Dineth de Silva) seems too aggressive for a monk who possesses Loukika Dyana (worldly factor of absorption). Ajith Weerasinghe portrays King Suddhodana’s character credibly. His controlled acting style and profound voice make him the real king.
The cinematography is superb. Enchanting looks of Yashodara (Pallavi Subash) has been captured extremely well by Channa Deshapriya with his camera.
Soothing music scores by Dr Rohana Weerasinghe add immense value to the whole cinema. Thumindu Dodantenna does the poet’s role so credibly. Dilan Karunaratne’s singing of poems sinks with Thumindu’s performance so well.
