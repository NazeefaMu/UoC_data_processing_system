Global economic downturn
SRI LANKA, NOT THE ONLY AFFECTED COUNTRY - PRESIDENT

President Maithripala Sirisena says that the economic downturn prevailing at present is not only limited to our country, but to many other countries.
‘Certain individuals issue statements saying that they can do what the government cannot do’, the President said. The President said that the government would work in a responsible manner for the benefit of the country and the people.
President Sirisena further said that even though smaller countries like Sri Lanka are vulnerable to the results of the conflicts between the world’s powerful nations, steps are being taken at present to overcome those challenges through proper economic management.
The President was speaking at a ceremony to vest the new administrative building at Mahara, in the people, on Saturday.
President Sirisena said that when politicians and public servants fulfill their respective duties free of fraud, corruption and malpractices, achieving the country’s economic goals will not be difficult.
“Furthermore, we have to nurture our society with the exemplary characteristics of our proud history, which gave pride of place to indigenous products, while becoming a self-sufficient nation, eliminating the habit of importing everything, including the kite, from foreign countries.
“This new administrative building has been built at a cost of Rs.445 million with the aim of uplifting the living standards of the people and business community in the Mahara area,” the President said.
President Sirisena also opened the newly built three-storied building at the Mahara District Secretariat constructed at a cost of Rs.50 million in keeping with the government’s policy of streamlining and creating an efficient public service.
