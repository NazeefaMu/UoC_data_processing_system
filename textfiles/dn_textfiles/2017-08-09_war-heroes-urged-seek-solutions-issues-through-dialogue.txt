War Heroes urged to seek solutions for issues through dialogue

All Island Disabled Ranaviru Collective yesterday called on all War Heroes in the country to seek solutions for their issues through discussions without becoming a cat’s paw of bankrupt politicians.
A release issued by the Collective’s President Deshabandu Anura Weligamage and Secretary Nishantha Kumara yesterday said that they had a fruitful meeting with the President’s Private Secretary and two other officials over the issues faced by War Heroes at the Presidential Secretariat recently.
“We discussed our issues with them for two hours. The President’s private secretary sought time to make president Maithripala Sirsiena aware of their issues and provide solutions for them,” the release said. The release said that the collective is waiting for a positive response from the President.
“We believe that the government has a duty to solve our issues. We are determined to find solutions to the issues faced by us through discussions with the government.
“There is no need to become a cat’s paw of bankrupt politicians to achieve our objectives. As non-political organisation, the collective members have never participated in protests to win our demands,” the release said.
“We have no involvement in the protest carried out by a group of War Heroes opposite the Presidential Secretariat, the release added.
