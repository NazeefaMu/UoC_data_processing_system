Land Rover celebrates 70 years

Land Rover marked its 70th anniversary with a global broadcast celebrating the world’s favourite 4x4s and the people who love them.
Starring the cars and the people who make and drive them, the online programme paid tribute to seven decades of adventure, humanitarian aid and hard work across classes and cultures around the world.
The broadcast started on Monday 30 April – 70 years to the day since the first Land Rover made its debut at the Amsterdam Motor Show.It went on to tell how Land Rover began as a utility model at the end of the Second World War and grew to become the world’s favourite 4x4, with more than 7 million sold.
Great models from the past as well as inspirational people behind the legend and a look to the future, with a level of insight only available direct from the factory.
Prof Dr Ralf Speth, Jaguar Land Rover CEO, said: “Land Rover was born with the launch of a single vehicle. Today our family of SUVs is testament to the pioneering spirit of innovation that has characterised Land Rover for seven decades. Our family of Defender, Discovery and Range Rover models provides unrivalled capability, versatility and luxury, giving us the perfect foundation for another 70 years of success.
A vehicle line-up including HUE: the first prototype Land Rover, the original two-door Range Rover and the seven-seater Discovery, as well as expedition-proven models from across the decades, will share the stage at the Land Rover Classic Works in Coventry. The current range, including the sector-defining Range Rover Evoque and Velar SUVs, will also be on screen as Land Rover celebrates its lifelong status as a favourite among celebrities, politicians and royalty.
The year of 70th celebrations has already begun and one of the vehicles from the start of the story will star in the show. In January, Land Rover revealed plans to sympathetically renovate the world’s most historically significant unrestored model – one of three pre-production cars from the original Amsterdam launch. Now in the hands of the experts at Land Rover Classic, it will take the stage alongside its closest modern relative – the exclusive 405PS Defender Works V8 revealed earlier this year. Only 150 of the powerful 70th edition models will be produced and each of the specially engineered V8 derivatives will be built under the same roof, by Land Rover Classic’s team of expert engineers.
The Land Rover range is available in Sri Lanka through SML Frontier, the sole agents of Jaguar Land Rover in Sri Lanka.
