Living a Spittel life

 
You know you are going to have one bumpy ride of a journey to your destination when you try to get into the vehicle and hit your head hard on the roof of the vehicle. This time, my destination took me to a little resident bungalow located in Nawalapitiya which was once the house of the renowned Dr. R L Spittel. It is known as Dr. R L Spittel's Harondale Estate Bungalow.
R L Spittel is known for his time spent with the Veddah community to learn about them and then writing many books such as Savage Sanctuary (1941), Vanished Trails (1950), Where the White Sambhur Roams (1951), Wild White Boy (1958), Brave Island (1966), Wild Ceylon (1924), Far-off things (1933) and much more.
The smooth uphill drive was one that never gets me bored. Greens of every shade surrounding you, the Kithulgala river telling you how bad the weather is (with the level of water you see from the top), and that fresh air you take into your lungs (telling that you should pack up from Colombo and move to one of these towns).
Taking the Awissawela route it's only about 5 hours to Nawalapitiya and I always say, you never feel the time flying when you are chit chatting away with your companions. As we left pretty late in the afternoon, we had stopped for a cup of hot plain tea with hakuru (jaggary) at one of the roadside kades (shops). Nothing like a hot kahata and hakuru at 5pm, to refresh your soul and mind after a good lunch.
Within an hour of having our tea, we come to Ginigathena where you turn off to Nawalapitiya. From there it was not so an easy ride to the bungalow. The road leading up to our abode for the night, (like I said in the beginning), was very bumpy. You might want to go in a vehicle that's like 3 meters high from the ground level. But this is also part of the experience of going there, the view is quite amazing, especially during sunset.
We were welcomed to R L Spittel's home by the present owners who bought the house 10 years ago. The first job of everyone who got out of the vehicle was to take out their cameras and start clicking away the property before the sun disappeared completely behind the mountains. While this took place, the cook at the property, Mary (known well for her Biriyani), brought out some hot milk tea - perfect for the somewhat cool climate. After taking some good shots and checking out the rooms, I happened to land in the room that was actually where R L Spittel stayed in and used to basically sit down looking out at the window and writing his novels. Yea, I was hoping I'll have a visit from him in the night to give me some inspiration in writing but nope, no Spittel came.
There are four rooms with three family rooms and 3 bathrooms (2 attached and one common). All the bathrooms are spacious with hot and cold water. There is one big living room with a TV and some of Spittel's books, so you can lie back on the arm chair and enjoy one of his books. Even the children have a collection of books to pick and read from the room.
Speaking to the present owner he said initially he didn't want to give it out to people. It was just him and his family coming here once every two weeks. Subsequently, I realized that because there was no one living here on a permanent basis, the bungalow was getting neglected. Then they started renovating it and last September opened it after a little bit of renovation for the public. They are now registered with booking.com as he wants to give it to out to foreigners who really love this kind of climate range and the nature surrounding it.
There was 2500 acres of land here, but the government took it over and finally they have 25 acres. It's known that Spittel first planted coffee here and it was subsequently changed to tea and in his book Bitter Berry, it tells all about his life.
For the package they offer, they give everything but request the guests to bring in their own towels. They can bring the dry rations and get Mary to make some amazing dishes her style. This property is ideal for large families and even if couples want to book it, they can do so but the price of the booking won't change for them. Plus if you don't want to cooped up in the bungalow all day, there are lot of things to explore nearby. There is the Handun Ella Water Fall, which is 30 Meters (100ft) and situated near Kithulgala joins the Kelani Ganga. This is just a 30 minute drive from the property after you get by the bumpy road. Then you have the Kitulgala Beli Lena Pre Historic Cave and Water Fall, which is about 8km from Kitulgala. Being one of the largest prehistoric caves on the island, this is where the 12,000-year-old skeletal remains of Balangoda Man (Homo Sapiens Balangodensis) was found.
Ever heard of the movie "the Bridhe on the River Kwai"? well it was shot here in Sri Lanka and in Kitulgala itself. This Oscar-winning film location is one place you should definitely go to see when you are passing by or put on your trek list.
Love waterfalls...then you will surely love Laxapana Waterfall which is 126m high and the 8th highest waterfall in Sri lanka and 625th highest waterfall in the world. Located in Hatton/Norton Bridge area in Nuwara Eliya District, it's a one and half hour drive from the Bungalow.
There is also a man made pool with a waterfall that one should really check out. This is right near the property but you have to climb down to get there and it's best you go with one of the caretakers so you get your bearings right and make sure you keep an eye on your children.
All this trekking, climbing and driving makes one hungry. And there's nothing like a home cooked meal waiting for you after all that workout. Mary makes some amazing dishes. You should definitely add sprats, canned fish, some vegetables, dough for string hoppers and she will make some really mean dishes to satisfy your cravings. Do ask her for her Biryani - it's quite unique from the others.
So need I say more or do you want to go check this out. You can log on to http://herondaleestatebungalow.com and make your bookings. This season will be the ideal time to go there.
