Galle MC inaugural meeting suspended for 10 minutes

The inaugural meeting of the Galle Municipal Council had to be suspended for 10 minutes yesterday due to issues in language interpretation.
When the Council convened, Mayor Priyantha Sahabandu had delivered a speech but Councilor M.M.Rihana complained that it was in Sinhala and that she could not understand it. Rihana asked for translation services to be provided to her. She pointed out that her fundamental rights had been violated due to a lack of translation services available at the council.
Accordingly, the meeting was suspended for 10 minutes but it took over one and a half hours for the council to reconvene.
The Council sought temporary assistance from a Muslim clerk working at the Municipal Council for interpreter services to continue with the business of the day.
The Councilors had four Standing Committees appointed with the Joint Opposition heading all of them.
The UNP councilors informed the media that though they had been chosen to work in these committees, they would not be attending their meetings.
