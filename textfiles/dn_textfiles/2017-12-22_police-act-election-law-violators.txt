Police to act on election law violators

The Police Department will take legal action against those who organised processions supporting candidates vying for the upcoming elections in several parts of the country including Kegalle, Puttalam and Anuradhapura districts.
Police spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekera said the respective Police stations and Divisional heads have been issued specific instructions to deal with election law violators.
“A separate unit has been established at the Police Media Division to monitor news and incidents of election law violations on all television channels daily”, he said
Gunasekera said a special police team has been assigned to obtain visuals of election law violations from media stations.
“Action will be taken against the OICs in the areas where candidates were seen entering the district secretariats in processions in violation of election laws after monitoring these visuals”, he said. Gunasekera added that OICs had been ordered to prevent processions supporting candidates arriving at District Secretariats to hand over nominations.
"Every OIC has been directed to report such incidents to the head of the division. An investigation into such incidents should begin under the close supervision of Senior DIG within a day, Gunasekera said.
