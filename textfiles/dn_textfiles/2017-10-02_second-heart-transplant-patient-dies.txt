Second heart transplant patient dies

The funeral of 19-year-old girl Sachini Sewwandi, who died at the Kandy Hospital after undergoing a heart transplant operation, will be held at the Aluthgama General Cemetery on October 4 at 4 p.m.
Sewwandi died three days after the transplant operation, while she was treated at the Cardiology Unit ICU of the hospital.
Her death, according to the death certificate, was caused with stalling of her heart beat due to high blood pressure in her lungs, her father Mahesh Kumara said.
Sewwandi, who was receiving treatment at Ward No. 78 of the hospital since March 27 was due to undergo a heart transplant on September 20, but it was postponed at the last minute due to unforeseen circumstances.
The operation was finally performed on September 27 morning and the doctors had told her father that the operation was successful.
