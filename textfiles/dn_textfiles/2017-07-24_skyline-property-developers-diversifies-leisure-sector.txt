This would also include a swimming pool and also a mini retail store that would serve mostly imported food items,” said Director, Skyline Property Developers d Dinul Wijethunga. “We have taken a two-storied space at Janajya City, Rajagiriya, for this facility.”
He said in addition they would also have a gymnasium with compete fitness equipment as well as entertainment and a dining package for customers. “We have observed that lot of people in nearby apartments need quality entertainment and this is what we will be offering.”
Commenting on their maiden 30-unit luxury apartment complex, Sykline Apartments at Bangala Junction in Kotte, he said that over 45% of the apartments have been sold out.”
“We have invested Rs. 400 million for Skyline Apartments, Kotte, which is in its final phase of construction. It will be unveiled by December 2017. “
He said that a unique feature of this project is that they did not undertake pre-sales and built the project to almost 75% and only then started selling.
“So when you pay, you get your apartment in less than five months and you can see the half-finished product rather than paying upfront for a design, or only looking at drawings and computer images.”

Skyline Kotte also features a dual-elevator system, parking with separate entrance and exit, 24-hour security and surveillance, vending machines and video surveillance in each apartment.
An engineer by profession, he said that they observed that many of their competitors in the industry keep huge margins and in contrast they want to keep a small profit and give a better deal for the buyer. “We do not want to be overpriced.”
He also said that they are looking at other investments in hospitality training and restaurants and also apartments in the future in the Colombo and Gampaha areas.
Apartments range in three categories, from 1,300 sqft to 1,450 sqft, and include three bedrooms, three bathrooms, kitchen, living area and three balconies. The starting price is under Rs. 19.6 million.
