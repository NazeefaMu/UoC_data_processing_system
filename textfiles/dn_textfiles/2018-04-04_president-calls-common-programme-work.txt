President calls for common programme of work

President Maithripala Sirisena has stressed the importance of having a common programme of work aiming at regaining the confidence of the people, when he met UNP Cabinet Ministers led by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Colombo last evening.
According to UNP sources, the President has had a very cordial and positive meeting with the Prime Minister and the UNP Ministers at his official residence in Colombo yesterday.
The UNP team was in the process of preparing this common programme of work to be presented to the President at 9 am today, at his official residence at Paget road for discussion.
“The President wants a common programme of work and to discuss about it,” party sources said.
Party sources said that the President’s support to defeat the No Confidence Motion moved against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is obvious as he was speaking of a common programme of work for the next one and half years.
