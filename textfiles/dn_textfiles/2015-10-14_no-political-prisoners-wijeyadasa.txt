No political prisoners - Wijeyadasa

There are no political prisoners held in any of Sri Lanka's prisons and it is upto the government to take a decision regarding the prisoners engaged in a hunger strike, Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said, adding that the Justice Ministry cannot take any decision about them on its own.
The minister was commenting on the strike action launched by a section of prisoners, yesterday. Minister Rajapakshe said 225 LTTE suspects are held in prisons today and sentences have already been served on some of them while legal action is pending against the balance. All these suspects have charges against them relating to bombings and killings.
