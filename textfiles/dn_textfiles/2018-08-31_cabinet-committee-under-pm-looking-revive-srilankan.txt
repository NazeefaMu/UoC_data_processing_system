Cabinet committee under PM looking to revive SriLankan

Cabinet Secretary Sumith Abeysinghe said a cabinet sub-committee chaired by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is looking into a viable proposal for the betterment of SriLankan Airlines.
Abeysinghe said President Maithripala Sirisena has recommended this measure.
Abeysinghe told the Presidential Commission investigating into the alleged frauds that have taken place at SriLankan Airlines, Mihin Lanka and SriLankan Catering that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had approved to provide US$ 520 million for SriLankan Airlines and Mihin Lanka on July 27, 2011.
He briefed the Commission on decisions taken by the cabinet on SriLankan Airlines from time to time. Abeysinghe was giving evidence before the commission chaired by retired Supreme Court Judge Anil Gooneratne.
