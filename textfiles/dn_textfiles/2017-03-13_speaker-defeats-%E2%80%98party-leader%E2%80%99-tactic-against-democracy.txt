Speaker defeats ‘party leader’ tactic against Democracy

A strategic move to create many obstacles to the smooth functioning of Parliament, and thereby the work of government, was prevented by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya’s ruling this week that Wimal Weerawansa, elected to the House on the UPFA ticket in the August 2015 general election, would remain an independent member of the House, and not a party leader, following his moving away from the UPFA.
The rowdy and boisterous protest in the House by Joint Opposition members after this ruling, when there were ugly personal insults hurled at the Speaker by Weerawansa, and saw the suspension of Dinesh Gunawardena from the House for one week for unparliamentary speech and behaviour, showed the extent of the defeat the JO, which is the Mahinda Rajapaksa team in the House, faced through this ruling, which strengthened the democratic process.
It was much more than rowdy behaviour of the JO that posed a challenge to the Parliamentary process through this party leader tactic used by Weerawansa. In fact Mahinda Rajapaksa said Wimal Weerawansa’s move was the part of a strategic plan that could not be revealed. It was a plan that would have had major repercussion on the business of the House, and the tasks of government, had the Speaker ruled that Weerawansa would be a party leader. This move came at a time when the UPFA is nearing the end of its practical term in the House, with the divisions within the SLFP deepening, and moves afoot for the SLFPers who are with MR to join the Sri Lanka Podujana Pakshaya (SLPP). The SLFP’s Kumara Welgama MP has already got endorsement from his voters to join the SLPP.
The acceptance of Wimal Weerawansa leading his five member team of the National Freedom Front (NFF) as a party leader would have opened the way for a barrage of new party leaders in the House. These would have been Vasudeva Nanayakkara – single member party leader of the Democratic Left Front, and the similar single member Udaya Gammanpila of the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya, and Dinesh Gunawardena who has a few more members in the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna; and others who may have won on the betel leaf ticket of the UPFA, to claim party leader status in Parliament. The problem this would cause for the functioning of Parliament would be their having the right to raise questions on matters of public importance under Standing Order23 (2) - which is the right of the Leader of the Opposition and leaders of recognized political parties in parliament. It is not difficult to see how much this would delay the proceedings of the House. They can also demand to attend the party leaders meetings that decide on the Business of the House, and also call for additional air time to be allocated in debates, as party leaders.
If this strategy worked, it would not be far off when all the SLFPers in the JO join the SLPP and these other “party leaders”, despite their complete lack of a voter base, would all be holding up the business of the House, as the SLPP has no party leader in Parliament. It was certainly a major strategy to delay and obstruct the working of Parliament and thereby he tasks of government, bringing about major obstacles to any legislative plan the government may have, or seeks to carry out in the future, unlike in the past two years.
Although Wimal Weerawansa celebrated his birthday in Parliament before the Speaker gave his ruling, he certainly did not get the birthday gift of party leadership. In fact, there was a major flaw in Weerawansa’s attempt to be a party leader, because although he was given the betel leaf symbol to contest the election under the UPFA, his party – the NFF – was not a member of the UPFA. The betel leaf symbol was a Rajapaksa giveaway to an ever faithful follower, which ensured that Weerawansa and the NFF got the SLFP votes, giving it five seats, doing much better than many SLFP members themselves.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya has certainly given an important ruling that will be taken note of in future attempts to seek such status by those keener on disrupting and manipulating the proceedings in the House to suit their political games from time to time, than in supporting democracy through good parliamentary procedure.
Geneva fallout
The Government is facing the fallout from its sharp change of position on the Geneva resolution of the UN Human Rights Commission, particularly on the matter of hybrid courts - the decision not to have any foreign judges on probes into alleged war crimes. Both President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe are clear in their position against foreign judges; the President on a principled opposition, and the Prime Minister on a practical opposition.
The new position, different to what the Sri Lankan delegation stated in Geneva two weeks earlier, will certainly helps the government in politics at home. But, it will have to do much more work on the many other issues of reconciliation and peace building that was part of the original Geneva Resolution in 2015, to present a credible image abroad of the government’s commitment to the wider goals of the resolution.
The government will need to show much more commitment to issues such as the setting up of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission and quicker and firmer action on the matter of Missing Persons, as well as, look again into the areas that remain to be implemented from the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) Report, which was Sri Lanka’s own initiative, to show those who are seeking better peace and reconciliation at home, and those keeping a watch from abroad, that this major goal of the government is not forgotten amidst the issues of domestic politics.
Sri Lanka has every hope of getting the additional two year period to implement what is stated in the 2015 UNHRC resolution, despite criticisms coming from abroad and some Sri Lankan voices here. But it will be necessary to achieve success on a wider area of activity, than has been seen since September 2015, and not let peace and reconciliation be an issue that will be canvassed in the next general election.
It will also have to seek better understanding with the TNA, and reach out to the minorities, while taking all action to assure the Sinhala majority of not having any cause for fears through the Constitutional changes and other measures that will be needed for better reconciliation.
Tamil Nadu politics
The death of a South Indian fisherman in the Palk Bay earlier this week, allegedly shot by the Sri Lanka Navy, has led to a rise in anti-Sri Lankan protests in Tamil Nadu. The Sri Lankan Navy has clearly said it did not carry out any such shooting. The Tamil Nadu Chief Minister K. Palaniswami, has asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to summon the Sri Lankan High Commissioner and convey the feelings of both “the Central and State governments against the incident”. The Indian Vice President Hamid Ansari has raised this issue with Sri Lanka’s President Maithripala Sirisena, when they met on the sidelines of the Indian Ocean Rim Association Summit, at Jakarta, Indonesia. The Sri Lanka President had said, “he had spoken to the Chief of the Sri Lankan Navy who had said that no such incident from the side of the Sri Lankan forces took place.”
The death of the fisherman, whatever the cause, has come as a ready tool for the Tamil extremist groups in Tamil Nadu, and the new Tamil Nadu leadership after the death of Jayalalithaa. The BJP’s leading Tamil member Subramaniam Swamy has raised the wider issue of cross border fishing in Sri Lankan waters by Tamil Nadu fishermen, because export quality fish is almost exhausted in the Indian side of the ocean. He suggests Indian fisherman be allowed fish in Sri Lankan waters, for which Sri Lanka will be compensated by the Indian Government. The issue of Indian fishermen fishing in Sri Lankan waters needs the best negotiation and a solution, giving priority to losses suffered by the Sri Lankan fisherman, mainly Tamils from the North. The Tamil Nadu forces have no interest whatever in the rights and plight of the Sri Lankan Tamil fishermen, although loud about the rights of Tamils.
New Delhi taking a more cautious attitude on this issue is most welcome. There is the welcome news that Sri Lanka and India have agreed to the release of 19 Sri Lankan fishermen held by India and 85 Indian fishermen held by Sri Lanka. The Sri Lanka Navy is carrying out all security and facilitation work for the feast of St. Anthony at the Sri Lankan island of Kachchatheevu, drawing pilgrims from both countries, this weekend. Although some voices in Tamil Nadu call for a boycott of the feast, the indications are it will be a success, recognizing the contribution of the Sri Lanka Navy to it.
