Sharp Tailoring for modern  man from BOSS

Introducing the latest tailoring development from BOSS, The Washable Suit. This versatile design, available in three different wool-based fabrics, reflects the brand’s mission to dress driven men with fast-paced lives.
Joseph Schooling, swimmer and Olympic gold medallist, is the face of the campaign, shot in Singapore. Chosen for his determination, ambition and drive to succeed, Schooling is captured where both he and the suit perform – submerged in water.
The swimmer’s lifestyle mirrors that of the BOSS man: his day-to-day routine is defined by being constantly on the move, where time is of the essence.The Washable Suit was created with a demanding lifestyle like this in mind. With no need for dry cleaning, time spent on care is reduced to a minimum.
The unlined jacket features a softer shoulder with a stripped back and reduced internal structure, while the soft waistband of the trousers allows for both wearing comfort and washability. Each fabric has also been specially developed and finished to withstand the effects of water and washing. The suit should be lightly ironed after being machine-washed to ensure a sharp finish.
Adding a further level of versatility, the jacket and trousers are sold separately to allow the wearer to mix and match different designs in the collection and create a number of looks with the separate pieces.
The Washable Suit is available at BOSS Store, Arcade Independence Square, Bauddhaloka Mawatha, Colombo 07.
