Word of caution for the pregnant

The Health Ministry advises all pregnant mothers infected with any type of fever or flu to seek hospital admission on the very first day of the disease, Consultant Community Physician Dr. Kapila Jayaratne said.
Dr. Jayaratne advises them because of the complications that can develop if they get infected with the dengue fever or Influenza.
Complications can be avoided by seeking prompt medical treatment, he said.
The first maternal death for this year (2018) was reported last week due to pneumonia developed as a result of getting infected with Influenza. Last year (2017) around 40 maternal deaths were reported due to dengue and Influenza, he said.
The Health Ministry has already issued instructions to all doctors (both state and in the private sector) and mid-wives to admit all pregnant mothers with fever or flu to a hospital as soon as possible to avoid complications and deaths.
