Facts and figures; not mere words and opinions: How has the coal power plant helped economy

 It was published in the media that the Power and Energy Authorities are planning to provide Sri Lankans with a lot of energy in the next 20 years and these would also consist of some amount of renewable energy. What needs to be emphasized here is the need to sustain the only firm and dispatchable renewable energy we have got - hydro energy - thanks to the far sightedness of Eng. D.J. Wimalasurendra whose bust is exhibited right in front of the elevators at the Ceylon Electricity Board. This note is an examination of the threats to this renewable energy and real potential of other renewable forms of energy which can be tapped within the next 20 years without impairing the full potential of hydro energy.
Energy and Economy
How a twenty-fold increase in fuel import bill in 14 years from 1999 to 2013 wiped out the benefit of the four-fold increase in apparel exports was described by us in an article in August, 2014. What this fossil fuel economy holds for us is spelt out by the following 1st sentence in the Executive Summary of “Energy Outlook - 2009”document of International Energy Agency. “It is no exaggeration that future of human prosperity depends on how successfully we tackle the following two Central Energy Challenges facing us to-day: (i)Securing Reliable and Affordable Energy and (ii) Rapid Transformation to a Low Carbon, Energy Efficient and Environmentally Benign System of Energy.”
What we should do is to accelerate the demolition of this fossil fuel based economy, or “tilt the field” in the words of Louis Pattler, (in the Book “Don't Compete - Tilt the Field”)and carve out a sizeable portion - about $ 25 billion exports/economic returns - for Sri Lanka rather than trying to retain the current fossil fuel economy.
How we analyzed these two Central Energy Challenges using the DMADV2 (Define, Measure, Analyze, Design, Verify and Validate)methodology in the Six Sigma Toolbox and came out with Highway Solarisation as the appropriate solution was explained in a paper presented at the International Energy Symposium held in Colombo on 27thJune, 2015. This paper was awarded a Certificate of Excellence by the Ministry of Power and Energy.
We studied the relationship between fossil fuel energy usage and economy and we saw that usage of coal influences both our hydro energy and agriculture. Our study of the relationship between coal power and hydroelectricity showed that while we generated 1038GWhr of electricity using coal for the first time in 2011, our hydroelectricity in 2012 dropped to 2009 hours of electricity generation - for the first time - or 2727 GWhrs of electricity while hydro capacity had, actually, increased from 1207MW in 2011 to 1357 MW (increase of 450GWhrs) in 2012. This also depicted the largest decrease of 1300hrs in hydropower generation hours in one single year during the previous 20 years. At the sessions by PUCSL to discuss the Long Term Generation Plan 2015-2035, we mentioned this relationship - Coal Power will reduce Hydro Capacity - and forecasted that actual cost of 1kWhr of coal energy to the economy would be Rs. 30.
The drought of 2014
When the drought of 2014 lowered agriculture production and hydroelectricity, we studied it quantitatively and these findings were published in local press in August, 2016. It showed us that if we operate our coal power plant at 80% capacity utilization (we still have not done this) (a) the CO2 generated will be 6.9 megatons/year, (b) the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere will increase by 23.7 ppm/year, (c) the atmospheric temperature will increase by 2.80C in 8 years (99% certainty), (d) this will increase water in atmosphere by 382.2 km3&(e) if this is sustained for 2 months our hydro capacity in reservoirs will get reduced by 2298 km3.
We computed cost of 1kWhr from coal in 2014 using (a) Cost of coal, (b) Rs. 55 billion loss of agricultural production, (c) 2358 GWhrs of hydroelectricity lost, (d) due to 3202 GWhrs generated by coal and found this cost to be Rs. 86.05/kWhr. In 2016, it may have been as high as Rs. 100/kWhr. While the hydropower capacity increased by 12.5% during the last 10 years the average hydro generation has decreased at the rate of 0.33% per annum during the same period.
Contribution of Coal and Thermal Transportation to our CO2 emissions
People say that CO2 concentration is highest in Kandy, etc. to project that coal power does not contribute to these. We measure CO2 in our atmosphere, in Sri Lanka, at low elevations.Kandy is a city in a valley with mountainous landscape right around it. Vehicular emissions from liquid fuels - with 1 water molecule for every C02 molecule - are considered as line sources leading to vertical dispersion. Dispersion rates depend on diffusivities and densitiesof N2, O2,H2O and CO2 and CO2has the lowest diffusivity and highest density and H2O vapour the highest diffusivity and lowest density. As such CO2 will remain at low elevation till it is absorbed by vegetation. H2O vapour if at a relative humidity of 90% at ground level will be at 100% relative humidity at about 450 meters & condense. Since greenhouse gases produce their greenhouse effectsat higher elevations only, these gases in Kandy will not produce a significant greenhouse effect.

What happens in Norochcholai, flat landscape for miles, is different. Gases leave the chimney at a higher elevation and temperature, vertically with a speed dependent on amount of coal burnt, excess air used, temperature of exhaust and diameter of chimney. After vertically upward movement, it moves at an angle dependent on the wind velocity. In addition to diffusivity and density, the viscosity of the gases will also influence the movement. Since the viscosities of the gases O2, N2, CO2& H2O are in the ratio 29:25:19:13, CO2 and any water vapour (coal has only 2-7 % hydrogen while gasoline and natural gas have 14% and 25% hydrogen)will move up ahead of other gases. These two will bring about greenhouse effect (H2O vapour is also a greenhouse gas) and, the atmospheric temperature goes up. Corresponding to this increase in temperature more water vapour will be required in the atmosphere to maintain constant relative humidity. Since there is not much water vapour coming from coal combustion, this additional water vapour comes from the ground.
Chapter 5 of “Frontiers of Climate Modeling” by T. Kiehl and V. Ramanathan gives a graph of how (a) Greenhouse Effect, (b) Atmospheric Temperature and (c) Water Vapourat two elevations in the atmosphere exhibit maxima and minima at identical points of time during different months of a year for a particular latitude band which shows that Greenhouse Effect increases atmospheric temperature which increases the water vapour in the atmosphere. When a liquid fuel is used too,CO2 will be generated to a lesser degree - going by theoretical values corresponding to their compositions and calorific values say, 0.25kg CO2/kWh for liquid fuels vs 0.37kg CO2 /kWhr for coal - but some water vapour required to maintain constant relative humidity in the atmosphere at the elevated temperature could be obtained from the combustion of the fuel itself. In the case of coal, CO2 generated is 50% more; temperature increase and corresponding amount of water vapour required will be more while this contribution of H2O is much less and the water vapour has to come from the ground and agricultural production and rainfall will suffer as a result.
Unfortunately, these aspects of climate change have not yet been captured in the LTGP of CEB.
Hydroelectricity lost due to coal combustion
Then we started studying performance of hydroelectric resources further. We saw hydroelectricity fluctuations been attributed to varying rainfall and we decided to check this. We calculated the hydroelectricity hours by dividing the total hydroelectricity generated by the hydroelectricity capacity and calculated the five-year average of these hydroelectricity hours. We are not sure about this five-year average; but hydroelectricity generated from 1992 up to 2000 with a steady 1137 MW capacity,showeda periodicity of 4 or 5 years.We considered hydroelectricity data from 1992 onwards and the two most significant observations are as follows.
(1) During the six years from 2000 to 2005, the hydroelectricity hours remained between 2277hrs to 2774hrs. While this may have been due to our not filling the reservoirs to the full for fears of the reservoir walls been blasted, the strange thing is that once the decision to put up a coal power plant was made in 2005, it again went back to 3554 hours and remained at values above 2774 hours till 2012.
(2) If we eliminate the six years from 2000-2005, the balance 19 years had the lowest hydroelectricity hours between 2000 hours and 2700 hours in the years 1992 (2550 hours), 2012 (2009 hours), 2014 (2637 hours) and 2016 (2569 hours). Three of these including the lowest are since we commenced our coal power plant.
We have calculated the paddy cultivation links to Mahaweli Waters and electricity as well though those details are not indicated here.
Another Coal Power Plant at Sampur
It was recently mentioned that we should establish another Coal Power Plant at Sampur. We don't say or think that we should shut down the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant for reasons considered by us . What we say is that we should operate it at 80% capacity (6307GWhrs) before we start work on another new one. Even in 2016, it generated only 4977 GWhrs.
This new one will be of the same type as the one that is established in Tokyo. My mind goes to that Thermal Sink as mentioned in IPCC Technical Assessment Report 4. On Page 185, it says about Tokyo as follows: The global average anthropogenic heat generated in urban areas is 65Wm-2 and inTokyo it is 400 Wm-2and in some months it could go as high as 1500 Wm-2..We talk about Colombo/Western Megapolis also been made like Tokyo where the population is about 8 million and there being a need of about 35000GWhrs/year of energy. Does not this imply that we should have this coal power plant - if we ever build it - close to Colombo. If we generate 6307GWhrs of coal energy in Sampur and transmit it to Colombo to power the Megapolis, we will lose about 630GWhrs of energy as transmission losses. This deprivation of 630GWhrs of energy to the system will result in a loss of Rs. 63 billion/year to the national economyat the rate of Rs. 100.00 given on Page 6.6 of LTGP - year 2018-2037 as Cost of 1kWhr of Energy Not Served.
We emphasize we should not build a coal power plant at Sampur for the following reasons.
(i) If we operate it at 80% capacity, we would be generating another 6.9megatons of CO2 resulting in the two coal power plants generating close to what we had been generating prior to them (14.98 Mt in 2011)
(ii) Sri Lanka's overall emission rate above our 65000km2 land scape will be about 443tons/km2 which is 6 times the global average.
(iii) Exhaust air from this coal power plant at Sampur containing 6.9Mtpa of CO2 would move westward and create a desert in the landscape - consisting of Anuradhapura, Dambulla&Polonnaruwa - considered significant in respect of cultural & agricultural importance. Dr. Noel de Nevers on pages 85 & 109 of his book “Air Pollution Control Engineering” emphasizes that in the absence of cyclones or similar phenomenon, the air movement in this region will be in the westward direction.
(iv) As we have mentioned earlier, this proposed coal power plant will definitely bring about unbearable reductions in our hydroelectricity generation and agricultural production. We will also lose our north-eastern monsoon rains.
Making CEB Profitable
We were surprised by what we saw in the Central BankAnnual Report - 2016. CEB which made a profit of Rs. 19.4 billion in 2015 made a loss of Rs. 13.2billion in 2016, while CPC which made a loss of Rs. 19.9 billion in 2015 made a profit of Rs. 69.6 billion. The unfortunate thing is that CEB may have contributed to both these - the loss at CEB & profit at CPC and also to country sending about $183 million of foreign exchange out and the Sri Lankan rupee falling down.
An entity planning to improve profitability should look at slabs of their expenditure at the highest levels. During President J.R. Jayawardena's time, his sister-in-law, late Dr. Mrs. L.G. Jayawardena wanted to improve profitability of State Pharmaceuticals Corporation where she was the Chairman and it was entrusted to me as Systems Analyst. We identified items which contributed the most to the cost structure and for about 24 months thereafter, till I left, I had to recommend the quantity to be imported and the number of instalments in every Tender Schedule and sign off, not only for those items, but for every item whether for the private sector or for the Government Medical Stores. Those expensive stocks were always brought in 4 instalments. We succeeded in reducing the stockholding of SPC from $7 million to $4 million during those two years with no increase in the stock out situation and I believe that the corporation may have got privatizedif not for thatsuccess.
So what we recommend to the CEB is always attempt to reduce the use of most expensive forms of energy. If we look at the two years 2015 and2016, we see that the consumption has gone up by 1061 GWhrs from 13088GWhrs to 14149GWhrs. Did they manage to get that extra 1330GWhr from coal? Where did they go to get this extra energy - excess demand of 1061GWhrs + 1367GWhrs of hydropower lost - 534GWhrs extra from coal + some other losses may be from mini hydro. They got 2304GWhrs more from oil - may be at an average cost of Rs. 31.00/kWhr; i.e. from the most expensive source.Of course, they had no options for they had not planned for any options. Are you surprised that CEB made that loss and CPC a profit?
What could they have done? That is where the forecasting and long-term generation planning comes in. When you are dependent on hydro for about 35% of your electricity requirement, you need to look at alternative natural sources which will give higher yields when hydro goes down. This would automatically direct you towards solar. In expanding our power generation base, our first priority should become solar as during the last 10 years our average hydro generation growth rate has been negative in spite of capacity augmentations. If, instead of that, we give priority to coal, the enemy of hydro, in a few years’ time the negative hydro generation growth rate will go beyond 1% per annum. Then we need to check what its strengths and weaknesses are and see how we could exploit the strengths and make weaknesses irrelevant. We will see two weaknesses. Weaknesses in lack of dispatchability and firmness and non-availability during night time where the current peak is. Please note that daytime peak is increasing and in 2030,it will be higher than nighttime peak.

Weaknesses in lack of dispatchability and firmness and non-availability during night time where the current peak is. Please note that daytime peak is increasing and in 2030,it will be higher than nighttime peak.
Way Forward
With day time peak of say 700MW above the base load - let coal power (firm, but not despatchable) handle this baseload to the maximum possible - for 10 hrs from 8.30 to 18.30 on 365 days would account for 2555GW/year. With about 700MW of solar yielding 1500hrs/year PV solar could have handled 1050GWhrs. Even if CEB paid Rs. 25/kWhr for this it would have saved CEB Rs. 6.3 billion/year. It is very important that we develop all technologies related to solar as in 2030 we will be having a day time peak of 4726MW. Sri Lanka gets about 118,625TWhrs/yearof solar energy out of which a significant portionis wasted - or rather allowed to contribute to global warming - unlike the balance which keeps us comfortably warm at near 280C, provides us light, get us agricultural products, keep the water cycle running. This enormous solar energy input need to be harnessed so that the peak energy demand from 2030 onwards could be met from the same. By 2030 we should be able to develop 3800MW of PV Solar Power or 5700GWhrs of SolarEnergy on the highways which will have the ability to pay back all the loans taken on highway construction while negating at least 50% of environmental damage due to construction and usage of highways. These are all verifiable, measurable data if only one is patient to read, understandand calculate.
Sometime back, in early 2015, Dr. T. Siyambalapitiya wrote to the papers saying that when CEB makes good profits due to excess hydroelectricity been generated, or oil been cheaper the benefits arising from this should be shared with the customers. When I was reading it, my mind went back to my days at Haycarb,where the then Managing Director, Mr. RajanYatawara used to resist all attempts at board level to distribute excessive profits resulting from cheap coconut shell charcoal (raw material for activated carbon)amongst shareholders as increased dividends. He would always say that we needed to preserve it for that rainy day when the prices would be higher or market would be lackluster and would invest the same in development work. These decisions preserved the entity to this day while many of its competing, global players had gone into oblivion.
On this line of thought we would suggest that whenever we get above average hydro energy, we invest such savings/profits in developing solar energy rather than oil or coal. But we should keep on developing other large non-coal, thermal units to provide firm, despatchable energy to support these large scale solar installations. Then we will have a solar + hydro combination to provide us a steady 12000GWhrs/year supply and about 18000GWhrs/year from thermal (coal, gas and oil) to top up while we will have other sources of energy such as wind, biomass and solid waste to support. We need to remember that, oil & gas will generate a large proportion of water vapour required to maintain the constant relative humidity corresponding to the elevated temperatures from higher CO2 concentrations due to the fossil fuel combustion unlike coal which generates only a meagre quantity of water vapour and balance has to come from the ground disrupting both agriculture and hydro power. 
With day time peak of say 700MW above the base load - let coal power (firm, but not despatchable) handle this baseload to the maximum possible - for 10 hrs from 8.30 to 18.30 on 365 days would account for 2555GW/year. With about 700MW of solar yielding 1500hrs/year PV solar could have handled 1050GWhrs. Even if CEB paid Rs. 25/kWhr for this it would have saved CEB Rs. 6.3 billion/year. It is very important that we develop all technologies related to solar as in 2030 we will be having a day time peak of 4726MW. Sri Lanka gets about 118,625TWhrs/yearof solar energy out of which a significant portionis wasted - or rather allowed to contribute to global warming - unlike the balance which keeps us comfortably warm at near 280C, provides us light, get us agricultural products, keep the water cycle running. This enormous solar energy input need to be harnessed so that the peak energy demand from 2030 onwards could be met from the same. By 2030 we should be able to develop 3800MW of PV Solar Power or 5700GWhrs of SolarEnergy on the highways which will have the ability to pay back all the loans taken on highway construction while negating at least 50% of environmental damage due to construction and usage of highways. These are all verifiable, measurable data if only one is patient to read, understandand calculate.
Sometime back, in early 2015, Dr. T. Siyambalapitiya wrote to the papers saying that when CEB makes good profits due to excess hydroelectricity been generated, or oil been cheaper the benefits arising from this should be shared with the customers. When I was reading it, my mind went back to my days at Haycarb,where the then Managing Director, Mr. RajanYatawara used to resist all attempts at board level to distribute excessive profits resulting from cheap coconut shell charcoal (raw material for activated carbon)amongst shareholders as increased dividends. He would always say that we needed to preserve it for that rainy day when the prices would be higher or market would be lackluster and would invest the same in development work. These decisions preserved the entity to this day while many of its competing, global players had gone into oblivion.
