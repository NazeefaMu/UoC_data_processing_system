‘Anything Goes’ comes to British School

The British School in Colombo (BSC) added another title to its proud heritage of outstanding performances with the presentation of Cole Porter’s timeless musical ‘Anything Goes’ at the school auditorium recently.
With ‘Anything Goes’, the BSC continued with its strong tradition of producing exceptional youth theatre productions within the school while encouraging young people to gain a fully rounded education.
Over 50 young performers from the Senior School, skilled in singing, dancing and acting transformed the auditorium into a spectacle and took the audience back to the ocean liners of the 1930s aboard the SS American.
Overall, it was a fantastic performance which was marked by Porter’s timeless songs, wonderful comedy and accomplished dance.
