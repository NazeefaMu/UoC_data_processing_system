Moragoda presents ‘fresh thinking’ agenda to spiritual leaders

As part of a consultation process, Milinda Moragoda presented copies of his non-partisan policy document, ‘Fresh Thinking for a New Generation - An Agenda’, to spiritual leaders and opinion-makers in the country.
The agenda was originally drawn up with the intention of developing a non-partisan national policy agenda for the country to stimulate public discourse and debate.
The preliminary version of this document was released in October 2017. Over the last nine months, Moragoda, together with the Urumayake Ulpatha Foundation, has been consulting citizens from a wide section of Sri Lankan society for feedback and ideas to be incorporated into the document.
