ARCHITECTURE OF REVERENCE

The Dalada Maligawa or the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic is located in the Royal Palace complex in Kandy. It houses the relic of the tooth of the Buddha. In ancient times, until the British occupation of Sri Lanka, it had awesome power, since it was thought that whoever holds the relic will rule the country. The Daily News speaks to emeritus professor of Architecture University Moratuwa, Prof. Nimal De Silva on the Dalada Maligawa once the seat of power in Sri Lanka.
Apart from being a destination that is frequented visited by locals and foreigners, even today the temple still has religious power with religious ceremonies being conducted by the Bhikkus.
Temple of the Tooth Relic consists of three main buildings. They are the Vedahitina Maligava, Pattirippuwa and Aluth Maligawa.
During the reign of King Sri Wickrama Rajasingha, (1798 – 1815 A.D) the front section with the Pattirippuwa (Octagon) was built by Devendra Moolacarya, the Architect. The king was supposed to have addressed the people from this building. This building a master-piece of Kandyan Architecture. It is considered as the symbol of identity of the Kandyan Architecture and was built in 1802 A.D. Out of his construction Magul Maduwa/audience hall or the pavilion held a prominent place.

The carvings of the wooden pillars which support the wooden roof are an example of wood carving of the Kandyan period. Sri Rajadhi Rajasinha of Kandy built it in 1783. Originally the hall was 58 by 35.6 feet (17.7 m × 10.9 m). After renovation, its length was extended by an additional 31.6 feet (9.6 m). Other nearby building to the halls believed to be demolished during the British rule. That space was later used to erect the Kandy Kachcheri and Kandy Supreme Court. Today it is used for state ceremonies and conserved under the department of archaeology.

“What we see today is not the Dalada Maligawa where the King lived centuries ago. All the two storey buildings are new additions. Only the Vadahitina Maligava was two storey. It is in the center where the relic is kept. At that time it was the only two storey building. All the others were single storey. This architecture is unique. Nowhere in the world do you find this form,” said De Silva.
Kandyan architectural style
The main entrance gate which lies over the moat is called Mahawahalkada. At the foot of Mahawahalkada steps there is a Sandakada Pahana (moonstone) which is carved in Kandyan architectural style. Elephants are depicted in stone on the either sides of the entrance. A Makara Torana and two guardian stones are placed on top of the staircase.
“In 1998, the LTTE attacked the temple, but they were not able to take the bomb inside. The bomb was blasted outside near the gate. Mahawahalkada was totally destroyed in the bomb blast and rebuilt afterwards along with Sandakada Pahana and other stone carvings,” said De Silva.
The entrance to the temple complex is through the Mahawahalkada. There are two walls on the sides of the “Wahalkada.” The outer wall is called “Walakulu Bamma” (wall of clouds). This same pattern is also used in the wall surrounding the Kandy Lake. The inner wall is called “Diyareli Bamma” (wall of water ripples). Both these walls are built with holes to place oil lanterns during the night.
Symbol of great power
The tooth relic was a symbol of great power for the Royalty of this country. The one who possessed the tooth relic was the king of Sri Lanka. So therefore it was guarded and worshipped. It was the palladium of kingship.
“The Maligawa was originally established in Kotte. The tooth relic was brought during the time of King Vimaladharmasuriya I. The Portuguese attacked the Kotte kingdom. Before that the tooth relic was taken out from where it was kept and hidden. Finally when King Vimaladharmasuriya I took over Kandy, the tooth relic was handed over to him,” said De Silva.
Doorway to the temple
“From the time it was brought in, the Perahera were rituals conducted by the King to show his people that he controlled and held the tooth relic. Even up to now the Perahera is continued in that form. If there was turbulence in the Royal Family, the member that possesses the tooth relic is suitable to be king,” explained De Silva.
It was the king who performed all the rituals connected to the tooth relic. It was Diyawadana Rala who helped the king whilst the King performed everything. So later when the king was not there it became a Nilame and now it goes as Diyawadana Nilame.

The golden canopy over the main shrine, built in 1987 by Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa, and the golden fence which encircles the main shrine are other notable features. The tooth relic is encased in seven golden caskets which engraved with precious gemstones. The caskets have a shape of a stupa. The procession casket which is used during the Kandy Esala Perahera is also displayed in the same chamber. All caskets are in the Vadahitina Maligawa. The doors of the Vadahitina Maligawa are carved in ivory. The actual chamber which the tooth relic is kept is known as the “Handun Kunam,”he added.
