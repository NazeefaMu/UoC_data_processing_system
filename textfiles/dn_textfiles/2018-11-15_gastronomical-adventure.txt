GASTRONOMICAL ADVENTURE

The Galadari Hotel together with My Sister’s Kitchen presented the much awaited “Jaffna Food Festival” at the Galadari Hotel Coffee Shop on November 9, 10 and 11 from 7 pm to 11pm. The festival gave the best of authentic Jaffna cuisine to the maximum.
You name it they had it and guests just could not get enough of it. The chef extraordinaire behind My Sister’s Kitchen is Thushara Innasithamby sister of the famous Danu Innasithamby. She complied to all the whims and fancies of the Jaffna foodies in the best manner possible.
The massive spread laid out made guests spoiled for choice and was no doubt a marvelous festival that will leave many gastronomical memories.
