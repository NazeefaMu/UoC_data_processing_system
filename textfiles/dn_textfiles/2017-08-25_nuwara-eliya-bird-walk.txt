Nuwara Eliya Bird Walk

Juliet Coombe went on a birding outing to Victoria Park, a glorious 27 acre garden where 90% of the tree species available are those of foreign plants, because it was originally set up as a place of research during Queen Victoria’s reign and under British Colonial rule.
With a small entrance fee you can’t really go wrong for a great bird watching walk with hotel naturalist Ishanda, as Victoria Park is the original template for the Hakgala Botanical gardens 10 km from Nuwara Eliya. Victoria Park is in contrast in the centre of town and therefore walking distance from most hotels, established in the 1840s and it is still the nursery for certain plants in the Hakgala Botanical Gardens. However it was not until 1897 it received its official name to commemorate the 60th Jubilee Coronation of Queen Victoria. If you want to visit the museum to find out more about its origins go right at the main entrance to see the little museum. Make sure you are aware of the opening times as it is owned separately and closes around 4pm most days. Also kids love going on horse rides with the gypsy lads that stand near the main gate.
A waterfall of branches
On entering this lovely, glorified oasis in the city, I am overawed by the diversity of the trees, in size, shape and form; there are around 70 to 80 different species. But the first feature, by the entrance, my naturalist guide from Jetwing St Andrews, Ishanda, takes us to is, of course, the rose garden, very fitting for Queen Victoria, herself once an English rose and a reminder perhaps of her days with the great love of her life, Prince Albert. The garden is a wonderful maze of concentric circles with frame works and pillars all draped with rose-vines. “It is best viewed in April when most of the roses are in flow,” Ishanda, my very knowledgeable flora and fauna guide from Jetwing St Andrews, tells me. On closer inspection, I notice plastic bundles around countless stems and ask him what on earth they are, not sure whether they are deliberate or some weird phenomenon of littering. “They are used for taking cuttings. By attaching bundles of soil half way up the stem, you allow the stem to grow roots of its own that will then enable you to transplant the stem straight into the ground once cut off.” Ingenious I am thinking just as he alerts me to the next wonder, an Indian Pitta, a chirpy little fellow with a yellowish breast and bright green plumage on its back.
He bounces off into the undergrowth of a grove of Eucalyptus trees that tower so high you would expect to find bloodthirsty giants in castles at the top of them. Vines have attempted to climb up these majestic trees but got lost half way up and end up entangled in neighbouring trees or giving up altogether and dropping down again like a waterfall of branches. But birds are the real benefactors of these monsters, as they can forage around in safety on the ground beneath or settle in the tops, hundreds of feet away from any predators or interferers. Victoria Park is home to a staggering 80 different species of birds. We promptly see another, the Oriental Asian Magpie, scouting around in the undergrowth, looking similar to magpies from other continents but smaller, sweeter and with a rather proud tail.
The park caters for a wide range of people with its large central well groomed lawn with open areas for recreation, surrounded by beautifully kept and amazingly vibrant flower beds and exotic creations such as the Asian Melaleuca tree with bark that looks like tree leprosy but feels as soft, light and smooth as I don’t know what, producing powder that treats skin disorders. We are fortunate enough to hear the tail end of a large group singing session together with musical instruments. “That is one of the advantages of it not being a national park,” Ishanda tells us, “The local people would not be allowed to do this in such a place.”
Explosions of beauty
As you move out from the centre you get to the wild borders where most of the birds can hide or go about their business unhindered, unless of course you’re a bird on the pull, in which case you might head for what is known as Kissing Corner but, despite the birds being the main draw for tourists, we find the authorities have cut down a number of large trees and cleared the area here such that it would now need to be renamed ‘voyeur’s corner’ if it were to remain an area for such pursuits, on account of its now being overlooked by five storey buildings across the street.
 We were not amused by the cut backs as it will affect bird life and Victoria would agree methinks.
However, this is a small blip in an otherwise wonderful visual and peaceful treat. Bright flowers lift the spirits everywhere with exotic offerings like ‘lover’s begonias,’ azaleas blowing their massive pink trumpets all year round, and cannas flowers with their bright yellow and orange furling trumpets. As I look up from these explosions of beauty unsurpassable even to King Solomon in all his glory, Cattle Egrets flutter past on their graceful flight to other places, past screeching Rose Wing Parakeets perching high in Cypress trees adorned with massive growths about their trunks. Many of the trees here also show off vibrant plumage like the Powder hub with its exploding fireworks of pink and white, the aptly named Bottle Brush trees with their bright red flora, the Hibiscus with red furled bells and vines that wind around their host trees decorating them like Christmas trees with pentagonal yellow and white six inch long trombones. Amongst them, if you are watchful and keen eyed, you may find Grey Wagtails, Spotted Doves or the migrating Kashmir Flycatchers, as we did.
Some trees capture the imagination with their curly ferns, all feathery and fluffy, others with their fungi busting sooted wax and whatever you do, don’t miss the multiple trunked Ali Bumbums as you leave the park, bidding you farewell as you once again get sucked into the mayhem of motoring just outside the gates of this incredible sanctuary for all creation to enjoy. The next day the naturalist spotted 37 species of birds on the same walk and four of them were migrant, five of them were endemic and others are Victoria Park residents. This birding trip included seeing the Kashmir flycatcher with it bright orange charming call. Ishanda explains as we walk back pass the temple through the busy streets, sun setting over the city of light, snapping away at street food characters he says turning into the Jetwing Saint Andrews Cottage “I love Victoria park because everyone can enjoy this magical garden, any age group will love it, any religion, people from any country as here there are no barriers and much to learn from the birds that inhabit this rich oasis of flora and fauna.”
