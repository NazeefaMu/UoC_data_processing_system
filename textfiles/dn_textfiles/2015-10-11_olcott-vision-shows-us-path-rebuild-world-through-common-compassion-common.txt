Olcott vision shows us path to rebuild world through common compassion, common

The Olcott vision shows us the path to rebuild the world through common compassion, common will and common living, former Minister Imthiaz Bakeer Markar said.
He made these comments delivering the annual Olcott Oration named under the late Henry Steel Olcott, who was a pioneer in initiating several leading Buddhist schools in Sri Lanka, in Dubai under the theme ‘A Prosperous and Cognizant life in a Multicultural Society’.
Many Sri Lankans living in Dubai participated. It was organised by the Alumni of Olcott schools in the United Arab Emirates.
Markar said Olcott clearly indicated that it is due to ignorance that attempts are made to divide us.
“This is very clear from his request to learn all religions in an impartial manner. A person who does not respect another religion is not a true Buddhist states a stone inscription made by King Dharmasoke. All this highlights the fact that we have reached a moment where the Olcott vision should be deeply embedded in society,” Markar said. “Asia has been either the birthplace or the centre of major religions of the world. Main religions such as Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity and Islam which nurture our society had their origins in the Middle East and India. Our origins are also connected to these countries,” he said.
“There are many similarities in the guidance offered to us by all these religions. I recall a stanza in the Dhammapada - Nathang Kammang Kathan Sadhu, Yamg Kathwa Anuthappati, Yassa Assu Mucko Rodang, Vipakan Pati Sevathi. If some action makes you happy in retrospect, it is advisable to repeat such actions. If some action makes you repentant in retrospect it is advisable not to repeat such actions,” Markar said.
Common path
“Similarly, I am reminded of a paragraph of the Holy Quran displayed at the entrance of the famous Harvard University. ‘Be fair and just. Rise up for justice even if it goes against your parents, relatives or friends. God will protect you’. We ought to follow a common path based on these values which enrich our society. We should consider our diversity as a resource. We should not consider it as a burden. Historically, no society in the world has progressed by following super communal beliefs. Both the First World War and the Second World War symbolise this truth to us. It is proved by what we witness in the Middle East today,” he said.
“We see accusing fingers being leveled at political leaders, religious dignitaries and corporate leaders for these situations. We hear that various conspiracies and hidden agendas are responsible for these things. But all parties in a society have to bear responsibility regarding this. Keeping alert and deep inquiry about what is said and done is very important,” Markar added.
Markar said: Col. Olcott who lived in the USA traversed thousands of miles and arrived in Sri Lanka because he heard the echo of the performance of a similar duty. The five great debates held to counter the efforts made by colonialism to spiritually defeat Sri Lanka which was a colony spurred Col. Olcott to arrive in Sri Lanka.
The echo of the 1865 Baddegama debate, 1866 Udammita debate, 1971 Gampola debate and the stiff and decisive 1873 Panadura debate which resonated were the historical story which prompted Col. Olcott’s advent to Sri Lanka. Reports published in all newspapers including the Times of Ceylon about the Panadura debate paved the way for it. Mr. John Cooper who was the then Chief Editor of the Times of Ceylon got the entire debate in Sinhala translated into English by lawyer Edward Perera of Kotte and splashed it in the newspaper. A copy of this report fell into the hands of an American scholar named J.M. Feeble living in Galle at that time.
He took it along with him to England and took steps to reprint thousands of copies and distribute it. One of the copies fell into the hands of Col. Olcott in 1878 almost five years after the debate laying the foundation for the educational revival which accompanied the Buddhist revival in Sri Lanka.
Col. Olcott’s objective through the main project he launched by contributing towards the Buddhist revival movement in Sri Lanka was to provide meaningful education to children of under developed regions in the country. It is very important to identify the Olcott vision regarding the objectives of education. I wish to emphasise that it would be a source of guidance towards the national unity and co-existence which has presently engaged our attention. I consider it pertinent to briefly mention the objectives of the Buddhist Theosophical society launched in USA on November 17, 1875.
Three main objectives were evident in this society he launched as a movement dedicated to search the truth devoid of differences as to colour, community, caste or religion. The first objective was bind the entire humanity together in brotherhood devoid of differences as to colour, community caste or creed. The second was to encourage the perpetuation of all religious and ideologies in an impartial manner.
The third was to explore data about nature and man’s internal powers. Finding solutions to the main problems we have currently encountered will not be difficult if we properly identify these objectives. Many crises which have presently erupted the world wide have communal and religious origins and tendencies. We can see one nation trying to subjugate another nation or one religious belief trying to subvert another religious belief. How logical is the path shown by late Steele Olcott to a world of this nature. I trust that we as children of Olcott schools to highlight this vision once again.
“True terrorism is Communalism” states philosopher Von Tepler. V.I. Lenin has described “Communalists as criminals killing human society”. When one nation is subjugated to another nation, giving leadership to the subjugated nation is called nation liberation struggle. If has lost his homeland the fight to regain it is called patriotism. A struggle does not end through rumour mongering. A national struggle will end only after obtaining natural liberation. A person who does not see the freedom of another nation or community does not see one’s own communal freedom. It is only for a short period that a community or nation can be suppressed by arms. This is a truth we evidence throughout the world.
It was the motto of Brahmadatta kings of Benares India which said “There is no religion superior than the truth” which Olcott accepted as the motto of his Buddhist Theosophical Society. The emergence of untruth over truth is the biggest challenge we face today. There are less opportunities within society for the truthful man. We should try to find our main reason for this. All this is became we talk about the result rather than the cause for the result. Our system of education is very important in this regard. The most outstanding among the services rendered by Col. Olcott often arriving in Sri Lanka are the steps taken by him to improve and upgrade education. We describe it as an attempt to uplift people suffering under colonial rule and a challenge against the attempt made by colonial rulers to first their vision and will over the people by force through education.
Memorial lecture
On this occasion I am reminded of a statement made by Islamic scholar Prof. Tarik Ramadan who arrived in Sri Lanka to deliver a memorial lecture in honour of my late father. He said, I quote :- Our own religion or way of life, is a partial reflection of the truth. The true meaning, can come only, when appreciating the truth. You belong to the truth but truth does not belong to you. The meaning can emerge only by experiencing prularity. To be fully human, you should share the truth of others and other religions. Meet the human being, accepting the truth, in their religion, tradition and philosophies.
All sorts of religious exploration lead to the same destination. Nations of equality freedom and humanity belong to all religious traditions and philosophies”. The speech made by Henry Steele Olcott at Bombay on March 23, 1879 can be shown as a moment which clearly explained his vision about education. He said “It is regrettable to see Bombay’s youth acting with the only objective of gaining a University degree. There are any amount of doctors and barristers in this country. But the country does not possess an adequate number of technicians. There are any amounts of graduates. But a skilled carpenter, miller, sugar maker or a paper manufacturer cannot be found anywhere. What India needs today are technological centers afflicted to study centers as in America”.
This statement meant that vocational units are needed within the education system. When one investigated the depth of national crises which have emerged in most countries one factor which becomes evident is the economic inequalities existing in those countries. The main aspiration of the youth generation is to seek a good job. The frustration caused by the obstruction of avenues to obtain the ability to seek a job and the proliferation of that frustration to rebellion against the administration of a country can be seen ending up as violent terrorism.
Communalism and religionism are the best agents fuelling such acts of violence. The best way to damage national unity and reconciliation and sovereignty of a country is to arm society with narrow visions of distrust, suspicion and alienation.
When we explain Olcott’s vision for education we can see an education system with a wide vision opposing it. It can be seen as an education system offering vocational guidance which developed knowledge and skills. We in Sri Lanka have suffered from two decades of war. We suffered from two youth rebellions which occurred since independence. There can be various opinions and descriptions about it. Sri Lanka’s failure to look at problems with an open mind by wearing various masks and hanging on to frigid viewpoints may have been one cause which aggravated problems. I believe that it is one reason Olcott’s vision and policy should be subjected to dialogue once again as school children and within Olcott schools.
It is not a difficult task because his belief and vision is based in a Buddhist foundation. What is our main challenge today? It is creating unity harmony and reconciliation in a multi national, multi religious, multi communal and multi linguist society.
Creating unity amidst diversity is the biggest challenge before the country. We can receive guidance from Buddhism which is one of the major religions in the world as well as Islam, Hindu and Catholic religions.
As Henry Olcott said we show offer guidance to our country to study the essence of all these religions. Guidance should be offered to liberate people’s minds from extremist feelings.
Guidance could be received for it by acting according to the Sathara Brahma Viharanaya (Metta, Karuna, Muditha and Upekkha) found in Buddhism the majority religion. It means overcoming hatred, eliminating, sorrow and promoting compassion and equanimity. If anyone is induced to treat every one in an impartial manner it amounts to equanimity. This is a quality strongly used in Olcotts’ vision throughout his service. This is symbolized by the four bo leaves found in the four corners of our national flag.
In a country where people nurtured by such thoughts are living there is room for any opinion or a viewpoint. Such a society does not discriminate against each other on grounds of community, religion caste or any other petty differences.
Although a multicultural social environment is seen in such a country it is not a harmful society. It will create a society rich in world accepted human values providing opportunities for a decent living protecting democratic principles. True democracy can be ushered only by realizing factors such as guaranteeing human rights, religious freedom and harmony among various religions groups, living in peace and harmony among minorities, ushering opportunities for all to gain quality education and sound employment and ensuring human dignity. We can obtain meaningful guidance for a decent living we expect in a multi-cultural society from the Olcott vision. The activities of an individual should be valued and appreciated on the basis of his vision. Philosophers and epochal men act with a special vision endemic to them.
Although Olcott was a foreign national he became sensitive towards people in Sri Lanka by transgressing narrow limitations. A person will act with such an idea when his or her vision is clear and conscience is strong. Understanding the vision which strengthened Olcott’s conscience and self confidence and vitality will undoubtedly help stabilize the existence of a multi faceted society at present.
Aristotle once said it is more opportune for a country to be governed by good men rather than good haws and regulations. I wish to bring it to your notice at this moment. In order to cleanse and correct our society we should first identify our own shortcomings and overcome and correct them. We should learn to offer pardon and beg pardon. It is very essential to be flexible and act with an open and unbiased mind.
It is very important to get induced to change what ought to be changed and stabilize what has been changed.
We should also take care to protect the sown cultivation without allowing get overgrown with weeds. It will stabilize the sustenance of a multi cultural society. We can identify the way to become true and equal Sri Lankans through a multi cultural policy based on social equality.
We can describe Col. Henry Steele Olcott as an exemplary character to develop an environment where everyone whether they be Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim or any other community to feel that this is their country of residence where they have a sense of belonging.”
