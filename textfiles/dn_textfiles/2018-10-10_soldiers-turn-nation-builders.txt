As Sri Lanka Army celebrates 69th anniversary:
Soldiers turn nation builders

Soldiering in Sri Lanka during ancient, medieval, colonial, post-independent and contemporary times undoubtedly mirrors how the exercise of military power, as in the case of many countries around us, turned our nation to statesmanship while ensuring a potent and dynamic force for defence of the new nation-state in place.
These histories, many of which are replete with sagas of gallantry and selfless dedication stand out as sources of inspiration to budding generations and serving troops alike.
The birth of the Sri Lanka Army (then Ceylon Army) in 1949 on a day like today (October 10), just 20 months after independence, testifies to the foresight and wisdom the founding fathers of the new nation state had at a time communism was replacing imperialism in the aftermath of decolonisation that began to occur in Asia after World War 11.
Ancient military encounters
The military history of Sri Lanka relates back to the days of the arrival of Prince Vijaya from India with a contingent of his followers, some 700 in number, as cited in the Mahawansa, but seeds for the first military engagement were sown only after Prince Vijaya and his followers vanquished the Raksha queen Kuveni.
Repeated incursions of South Indian Cholas into the country during the period of King Pandukabhaya whose kingdom was established in Anuradhapura around 544 BC, prompted him to raise his own rival forces to defend his territory, along with erection of some fortresses around Anuradhapura.
More prominently, King Dutu Gemunu’s (around 200 BC) warfare with an army of some 11,000 island-inhabitants, against the invading Chola prince Elaara, an encounter which has gone down in history as the first recorded military offensive against a foreign invader in a well-organised manner is well revered to date.
Before the country fell under colonial rule around the 15th century, Royal history speaks how a galaxy of rulers such as King Gajaba (113 AD), King Dhatusena (433 AD), King Vijayabahu (1001 AD), King Parakramabahu the Great (1153), Parakramabahu VI, and others resisted foreign intruders and reinforced their command in the country with their outstanding military expeditions. Strong fortresses were erected, naval powers fortified, but all those defences were done strangely without any standing Army, according to the chronicles.
Colonial era
Records compiled during the occupation of the Portuguese (1500 - 1658 AD), the Dutch (1658 - 1798 AD) and the British (1798 - 1948 AD) clearly assert how groups of military commanders at provincial levels from time to time organised resistance or rather ‘rebellions’ against conquerors by inculcating an esprit de corps among Sinhala patriots.
Construction of fortresses by Sinhala kings, many of which remain in Sigiriya, Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, and Kotte are a living testament to the excellent engineering skills that they possessed and their foresight in evaluating the potential threat of the enemy in any given scenario.
The invasion of the British and their subsequent occupation was focused on their own security, particularly as regards the Indian Empire. Unlike the Portuguese and the Dutch, British colonial powers began intruding the up-country and provoked uprisings of the locals against them which are well documented. What is unique in the Kandyan uprisings is how those local fighters resorted to guerilla warfare and became a formidable threat to the Britishers.
Significantly, the Britishers having experienced different fighting skills among the locals and also distinguished war-fighting techniques, by 1802 formed the 1st Ceylon Regiment, commanded by a British Commanding Officer. It was followed by the 2nd Ceylon Regiment and the 3rd Ceylon Regiment which fought in the Kandyan wars in 1803.
One must not forget that although those regiments were largely of the Sinhalese, other ethnic groups like Malays and Africans also joined those regiments. The British renamed those regiments the Ceylon Rifle Regiment in 1817 and began recruiting. However, Weera Puran Appu’s Matale Rebellion, a landmark threat to the Britishers, ended the recruitment of ‘Cinghalese’ to the British Army due to different reasons.
Around the same time, the volunteer movement in Ceylon, which was meant to compensate for the void created by the disbandment of the Ceylon Rifle Regiment in 1874, began. A few years later, representations made to the British Crown permitted the petitioners to form themselves into the ‘Ceylon Light Infantry Volunteers’ (CLIV).
The pre-independence evolution of the existing Army wings and formal raising of the Ceylon Army which was prompted by the World War I, and afterwards, World War II, was clear evidence that the local political leadership was also strongly supportive of Ceylon having a defence policy of their own since Ceylon lies on the sea routes of the world. The local political leadership that replaced the British signed a Defence Agreement with the British Crown on the eve of Ceylon gaining Independence.
Ceylon Army
Dominion status as a Commonwealth member and the Defence Agreement guaranteed Ceylon’s security and enabled the local political leadership to raise the Ceylon Army (1949), Ceylon Navy (1950) and Air Force (1951) respectively, as independent Ceylon legislated their formation in Parliament. This landmark development of the armed forces was however fully identical to the British defence structure.
Though the concept of having our own Army troops was a new one, it required proper planning and training which therefore prompted the first Permanent Secretary to the Defence and External Affairs Ministry at that time, Sir Kanthiah Vaithianathan, to stimulate the undertaking with the inclusion of British advisors in the Ministry to fine-tune the structure of the Army. As a result, the Army Act of No. 17 of 1949 imparted legal authority for the establishment of the Army.
Cycles of violence
The support of Army troops was sought when ethnic tensions and internal strife occurred in 1952 (hartal), 1959 (anti-Muslim tension), 1971 (JVP insurrection), 1983 (ethnic clashes), 1989 - 1990 (JVP terror), and so on.
The murder of 13 Army soldiers in one single incident in 1983 by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Jaffna and the subsequent threats that began developing in relation to Northern security concerns made the Army play a more formidable task. Successive Army Commanders in close collaboration with Police and Defence Ministry authorities, between 1965-2005 threw their weight behind the governments in power, while the LTTE threat was looming large, entering the very heart of the South. However, it is pertinent to mention here that all those Army engagements against internal threats were largely meant to support the Police as an auxiliary force in defensive roles.
The escalation of LTTE violence in the North and East incurring huge human and public property losses compelled all service commanders, Police and defence authorities to assess ground realities and devise new defensive strategies to take on the enemy. The Army assisted by sister services continued to hold their strongholds in the North despite fierce armed encounters with the LTTE terrorists.
Turning Point
The period between the final quarter of 1999 and 2004 was one of the most unpredictable in recent history, since the LTTE, making use of temporary ceasefires, went on strengthening their armoury and replenishing their fighting cadres. Yet, the Army remained confined to their barracks and camps across the North and East, honouring its commitment to peace. However, as during the presence of the Indian Peace-keeping Force (1989-1992), the LTTE used the ceasefire to their maximum advantage, here and abroad.
Win over terrorism
Different Army Commanders, taking a serious note of developing violence, added new wings, like sniffing battalions, Commandos, Special Forces, and air mobile platoons, with a view to countering the LTTE. With a new government in place by 2005, the public mood was clear. People wanted the LTTE menace to be wiped out if they were not genuine about peace dividends. The Army, together with its sister services, was fully confident that they could take on the terrorists, provided they were supplied with weaponry to match the enemy threats.
The LTTE’s closure of the Mavil Aru anicut initialled the beginning of the road to its annihilation by ground troops as the public pressure was mounting against LTTE atrocities. Army troops moved into dense Eastern jungles and took on LTTE hideouts and cleared the entire East of the LTTE. Those battles of the Army caused no harm to any civilian as reported and ended effectively before ground troops began moving North. Sri Lanka Army’s outstanding achievements in the Northern theatre of violence between 2006 and 2009 have already gone on record. But one of the most humane approaches that had ever been made by any Army in the world, for that matter, was the Sri Lanka Army’s rehabilitation of near 13,000 LTTE terrorists, who had either been captured or who had surrendered to the Army.
Army under transformation
The three-decade conflict that concluded with the defeat of the LTTE in May 2009 stood out as a litmus test for brave soldiers of the Army who were the driving force behind the humanitarian operations. Not only that, the victorious Army personnel observed a 48-hour pause by silencing all guns as a mark of respect to all the victims. The maturity shown by the troops after their military dominance reaffirmed how much the Army was into human concerns.
At first, the Army turned its role towards a new dimension, based on the 5R Concept (Reconstruction, Resettlement, Rehabilitation, Reintegration, Reconciliation), just a few months after the conclusion of the war.
The Army assisted the people to get back to their normal lives and extended every possible humanitarian assistance in close coordination with different state and other agencies which came forward to help reconstruct the devastated North. The trust placed in the Army during both wartime and peacetime by all stakeholders displayed that the Army was treated as the inevitable land force, capable of managing any challenge for the benefit of the masses.
Nation re-building
The daunting tasks of nation-building, for the benefit of the masses, and reconciliation, to avert any recurrence of violence in future, is another landmark project that has now been undertaken by the Army since it possesses required manpower as well as the technical expertise.
After 2015, the Sri Lanka Army having engaged in bitter fighting for over 30 years has been instrumental in addressing their own structural and operational requirements to be in line with professional standards. Various new reforms are being executed with strict focus on extensive training modules and right-sizing of all units throughout the island to be in compliance with the incumbent Commander’s vision in terms of nation-building, training and administration of the organisation.
At present, Army troops throwing their full weight behind national campaigns, are engaged in mammoth cultivation programmes, distributing coconut and other saplings in the North and East, renovating and constructing religious and public places and schools, renovating nearly 2,000 irrigational tanks, distributing drinking water to drought-hit civilians and distributing essentials, school accessories, and push bicycles to the people.
The Army is also building new houses for low-income groups, involved in environmental projects, donating blood to Northern and Eastern hospitals, conducting medical clinics, distributing free spectacles and medicine, supplying agricultural equipment, repairing abandoned waterways and canals, and cleaning sacred premises,
Further, the Army conducts reconciliation projects, conducts motivation lectures for rural youth, secures employment opportunities for the unemployed, distributes free fertilizer among farmers, constructs pre-schools for low-income groups, conducts leadership training programmes for civilians, to name some of its humanitarian projects.
Above and all, the quick and rapid deployment of Army troops in the event of large-scale national disasters and catastrophes like landslides, floods, storms, and garbage slides, has come in for praise from all quarters due to their unmatched skills to face any eventuality. The present-day Army has turned out to be the most sought-after service provider in the island which is capable of minimising wastage and estimated costs in an impressive manner.
Foreign recognition
The Sri Lanka Army, now gaining recognition at foreign levels as a matured entity, has been proud to continue with its mega annual flagship projects like the Defence Seminar, Field Training Exercise ‘Cormorant Strike’, Army to Army Staff Talks and Defence Dialogues. Its participation in overseas UN assignments as peace-keepers, observers or staffers has also brought fame and dividends to all ranks while achievements in the field of athletics and sports have also added special significance to the Army both at national and foreign spheres. Participation of its cultural troupes and bands in international events is another landmark achievement of the Army in the recent past.
Another important facet in the training modules that has been introduced by the incumbent Army Commander is the exchange programme of logistic knowhow of Warrant Officers in the Sri Lanka Army with regional armies like India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, through which batches of Sri Lankan Non-Commissioned Officers are sent for training in those armies.
It is clear this reputed organisation which is enshrined with the sacred duty of defending the county’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and the independence is well geared to take on any challenge whatsoever that would come along the way. As the Commander himself has repeatedly quipped, “The Army is in its highest readiness more than ever to face any challenge” while making every possible effort to avert any resurgence of violence in the country, displaying the maximum degree of its alliance for promotion of reconciliation and ethnic harmony wherever they serve.
As the Roman poet, Horace once wrote encompassing ethos of bravery, “It is sweet and fitting to die for one’s country” and brave sons and daughters of the Army in future too would explicitly exhibit their valour and determination to safeguard the interests of this nation at this milestone 69th Army Anniversary, commemorated today. May our brave soldiers have strength and wisdom to steer clear of all hurdles and take this beautiful isle of ours to prosperity and righteousness.
