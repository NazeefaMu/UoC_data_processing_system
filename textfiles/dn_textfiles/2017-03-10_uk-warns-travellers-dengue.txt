UK warns travellers on dengue

The United Kingdom’s government has issued a travel advisory cautioning travellers to take extra precautions to be protected from dengue.
“All regions of Sri Lanka experience outbreaks of the mosquito-borne dengue fever; 19,419 suspected cases of dengue fever have been reported between January and March 8 2017,” the advisory said.
An official from the Sri Lanka travel sector said this is very damaging to the Sri Lankan hospitality sector and the issue should addressed. It also adds, most visits to Sri Lanka are trouble-free. However, you should be aware of the risk of sexual assault, spiked drinks, road accidents, drowning due to dangerous tides and credit card fraud.
It has also reminded about the airport closure of the Bandaranaike International Airport from 8am to 4:30 pm daily upto April 6, 2017 due to runway resurfacing work. (SS)
