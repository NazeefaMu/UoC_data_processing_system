Bring perpetrators to justice: TNA

The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) issuing a press statement on Saturday, strongly condemned the attack on Jaffna High Court Judge Manickavasagar Illanchelliyan.
An unidentified man had shot at Justice Illanchelliyan, who is currently presiding over the case on the rape and murder of Vidya Sivayoganathan, at the Nallur Junction on Saturday evening.
The Police officer who was injured in the shooting incident died at Jaffna hospital yesterday.
“We urge the Inspector General of Police to bring the perpetrators of this incident to justice and to investigate the conspiracies behind this incident. While we strongly condemn these kinds of violent attacks on the administration of justice, we are gravely concerned that the incidents of crime in the Jaffna Peninsula have reached serious levels,” TNA Spokesman and Jaffna District MP M.A. Sumanthiran said.
“This situation must be arrested immediately and we request all concerned to cooperate to bring these kinds of incidents to an end,” he noted.
