Warrant issued on Jaliya Wickramasuriya

 
The Colombo Fort Magistrate today issued a warrant to arrest former Sri Lankan Ambassador to the United States Jaliya Wickramasuriya for his failure to appear before Court.
The FCID filed a B report in the Fort Magistrate’s Court against Jaliya Wickramasuriya for allegedly misappropriating USD 330,000 out of USD 6.6 million allocated for purchasing a building for Sri Lankan Embassy in US.
When the case came up before Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne, the suspect was not present in Court.
The Court was informed that the suspect has gone abroad for medical treatment with Court permission but failed to return before due date.
The FCID alleged that the suspect had misappropriated the concerned amount committed during the purchase of a building to house the Sri Lankan embassy at 3025, White Haven Street, Washington 20008.
The former ambassador had remitted this money to Sri Lanka.
The former Ambassador is a close relative of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
