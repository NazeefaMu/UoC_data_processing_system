Spa of the World

The Body Shop team created ‘Spa of the World’ for women seeking to indulge in some well-deserved ‘me time’. The full Spa of the World range of bath milk, creams, massage oils and exfoliants offer a relaxing and revitalizing ritual to choose from. The complete Firming Spa Ritual comprises of offerings that include French Grape Seed Scrub and Thai Makrut Lime Firming Oil. Infused with fruit extracts from forests and vines and blended into refining textures and invigorating fragrances, this uplifting regime has been designed to empower skin, body and mind.
They tone and strengthen skin with a revitalizing formula headily perfumed from the premium quality, Community Trade ingredients used in their making. The Body Shop maintains its longstanding commitment to ‘Enrich, Not Exploit’ by creating products that use ingredients sourced from ethical supply chains, with their heritage rooted firmly in farming communities around the world. For example, the French Grape Seed Refining Scrub is infused with grape seed powder from France and Community Trade organic sugar from Paraguay to help invigorate, exfoliate and refine skin.
Grape seeds are prized for their high polyphenol content, a powerful antioxidant known to firm the skin. Massaging with sugar is great for promoting circulation and evening skin tone. Similarly the Ethiopian Green Coffee Cream is enriched with Community Trade organic olive oil from Cilento National Park, Italy.
