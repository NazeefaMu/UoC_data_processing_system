PRASANNA  JAYAWARDENE  - stumped  out too early


The spotlight today is on PRASANNA JAYAWARDENE. Aptly put: Reliable stumpers and batsmen don’t come that easy. JAYAWARDENE came too early and left too early. Nonetheless his will remain a legend for upholding the honor of his school that made him an outstanding cricketer.
In the good old days, especially in the late 1950s and early 1960s when it came to cricket, St. Sebastian’s College, Moratuwa a leading Christian Brothers school produced cricketers of repute who could have held their heads high and stood up to the best.
But Ceylon selectors at that time seemed blind to outstanding cricketers emerging from lesser known schools and only focused on cricketers emerging from the big schools who the selectors of that era could be best described as 'Myopic'.
Accepted that the country was not playing Test cricket at that time. Yet cricketers from the Moratuwa school could have been considered for the odd ‘whistle stop’ game or the Gopalan Trophy game that was in vogue in that era.
Selectors open their eyes
The credit for making the selectors open their eyes and look at cricket and cricketers from that school goes to who could be termed the Duleep(sinjhi) of Moratuwa and Sri Lanka cricket DULEEP Mendis.
Before going on to dwell on most of the outstanding cricketers who later sported the country’s colours, two names that could have attained stardom were a former captain of that school, that batting genius Kingsley Fernando and a leg spinner in Vere de Silva. Fernando was the captain when I captained St. Benedict's College in 1960.
Fernando made tons of runs in school cricket and later Sara cricket also playing for the university in the team that won the Sara Trophy in 1964 under Josephian Carlyle Perera.
Galaxy of leg spinners
De Silva was a right arm leg spin googly bowler who shone in the galaxy of leg spinners of that era in Michael Tissera, Lareef Idroos, Sarath Vithanaga, Raja de Silva. The writer was also a leg spinner and I would leave the judgement of his prowess to his peers at that time and to the records that should speak for themselves! . Leg spin bowling became sadly a dead art after the brilliance of D.S. de Silva the leg spinning all rounder, Captain and once chairman of Sri Lanka Cricket Interim Committee and to whose credit stands the Hambantota International Stadium and the Muralitheran stadium in Pallekelle.
But after the country played itself into the elite of Test cricket, players from St. Sebastian’s who made the selectors take notice were Duleep Mends, Romesh Kaluwitharne, Susil Fernando PRASANNA JAYAWARDENA and the latest Amila Aponso.
This week ‘SPORTS LEGENDS’ focuses its head lights ON HEWASANDATCHIGE ASIRI PRASANNA WISHVANATH JAYAWARDENE a wicket keeper/batsman who shone in school and club cricket and caught the eyes of the selectors who were quick to give him the breaks in big time cricket.
Solid right hand batsman
In addition to his Rodney Marsh- like wicket keeping, PRASANNA was a solid right hand batsman who propped the middle order and scored runs when necessary. Incidentally to those not in the know, Marsh was one of the finest wicket keepers produced by Australia and where caught Marsh bowled Dennis Lillee would appear regularly in score books.
JAYAWARDENE was not a flashy wicket keeper. He would appear calm and collected with the gloves and would dive right or left and take regulation catches with ease and his stumping of batsmen was certain. He was a glove man and batsman any captain would love to have in his team.
As a right hand batsman he had it in him to always show the full face of the bat to ball and would seldom play the horizontal bat. The future was his to be a permanent fixture in the SL team. That he could not play much longer and show his prowess was because a few failures saw him out as Kumar Sangakkara was breathing down his neck.
Fortunate to watch
One knock of his which I was fortunate to watch was the century he scored against England in Cardiff when covering the tour for the ‘Daily News’ and ‘Sunday Observer’ in 2011. But that knock was not enough to save the country from defeat.
Not only did JAYAWARDENE show his class in the longer version of the game, but also excelled in the ODIS. He played in 58 Tests and only six ODIS.
In all he had 4 Test hundreds and five half tons. His three figure scores came against Bangladesh 120 not out, 154 not out against India, 112 against England and 120 against Pakistan.
As just a 19 year old he toured England and showed good form and was tipped to have a long and fruitful innings for the country. However the form of his school mate Kaluwitharne and the knocking on the door by Sangakkara saw him bow out which was sad on him and the country’s cricket.
Too tiresome
But there were Tests where wicket keeping and batting at number three for the country was too tiresome for Sangakkara and JAYAWARDENE was recalled as wicket keeper and strengthened the middle order batting.
JAYAWARDENE made his Test debut versus Pakistan in Kandy in 2000 and wore hi gloves for the last time in Tests was in Wellington against New Zealand in 2015. ODI debut vs Pakistan at Sharjah in 2003 and last ODI fling in Abu Dhabi also against Pakistan in 2007.
JAYAWARDENE played for Sri Lanka, Basnahira South, Bloomfield, Colombo Cricket Club, Marylebourne Cricket Club, Nondescripts, Sebastianites, Sinhalese Sports club and Sri Lanka Board President’ s X1.
Reliable stumper/batsman don’t come that easy. JAYAWARDENE came too early and left too early. Pity.
