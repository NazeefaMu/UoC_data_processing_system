Fisheries Minister to crack down on blast fishing

Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera has instructed the Police and Navy to strictly enforce the law against fishermen who engage in blast fishing or dynamite fishing.
During the advisory committee meeting held recently at the Ministry, Minister Amaraweera instructed relevant authorities to raid and arrest persons engaged in dynamite fishing and transporting and selling those fish.
The Minister further instructed the security forces to look for the persons selling explosives to the fishermen and arrest them too.
Blast fishing or dynamite fishing is the practice of using explosives to stun or kill schools of fish for easy collection and this illegal practice can be extremely destructive to the surrounding ecosystem, since the explosion often destroys the underlying habitat such as coral reefs that supports the fish, said the Minister.
During the meeting the representatives from fishery unions briefed the minister that dynamite fishing has increased in the Eastern province, causing huge damage to the ecosystem. The officials also stated that such fish are likely to rot and become inedible quickly.
The Director General of the Fisheries Department said that around 352 raids have been conducted by department officials following public information. The persons arrested have been produced before court.
