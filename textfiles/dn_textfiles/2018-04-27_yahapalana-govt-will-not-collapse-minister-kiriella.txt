Yahapalana Govt will not  collapse - Minister Kiriella

“A Memorandum of Understanding will be signed soon to continue the Yahapalana government. This government will not fall though many want it that way,” said Public Enterprise and Kandy Development Minister Lakshman Kiriella on Wednesday. The Minister made these remarks while attending a ceremony to welcome the representatives of the Gampola Urban Council.
“A Memorandum of Understanding will be signed soon with the agreement of the President and the Prime Minister. The new Cabinet committee is scheduled to be sworn in soon.
The government would be continued with a coalition with the UNP and the SLFP. We have established independence in the courts.
We have upheld democracy and had created a chance for the country to glow internationally,” stated the Minister.
“Certain media institutions wait to see the collapse of the government. But it will not happen. Together, we won a presidential election and we overcame the no confidence motion too,” he said.
The Minister further hinted at the future plans of the government too. “We are ready to face the presidential election during the next year. Both the parties worked together and rendered a great service to the public, the greatest of them being the media freedom,” the Minister stated.
The chairman of the Gampola Urban Council and many public representatives attended this ceremony.
