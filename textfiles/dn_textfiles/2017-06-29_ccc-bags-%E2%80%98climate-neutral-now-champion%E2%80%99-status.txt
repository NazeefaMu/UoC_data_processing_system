CCC bags the ‘Climate  Neutral Now Champion’ status

Sri Lanka based Carbon Consulting Company (CCC) was accorded another global recognition when the United Nations (UN) Climate Change Secretariat awarded them ‘Climate Neutral Now Champion’ status, elevating it to the same platform as other global sustainability solutions providers, such as UK’s Natural Capital Partners, My Climate and The South Pole Group as well as multinational corporate sustainability leaders such as M&S, Aviva and Philips.
Climate Neutral Now is an initiative led by the UN Climate Change Secretariat. It encourages companies, organisations and individuals to contribute voluntarily to increase climate action globally, to limit the rise of global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius, and to tackle climate change. Participants of Climate Neutral Now commit to measure, reduce and offset their climate footprint.
The Climate Neutral Now initiative of the UN Climate Change Secretariat coordinator, Niclas Svenningsen welcomed CCC to the initiative.
Addressing at the event he stated that The Carbon Consulting Company, through its mission, is dedicated to provide advice to other companies to measure, reduce, and offset their greenhouse emissions to help society become climate neutral and to contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.
“This is completely aligned with the goals of Climate Neutral Now. Our congratulations to The Carbon Consulting Company for its actions, which sets an example for other companies,” he said. Speaking on the occasion, CCC, CEO Sanith de S. Wijeyeratne said, “The mission of CCC to facilitate the creation of a cleaner and greener corporate environment actually predates the adoption of the UN Goals on Sustainable Development.
But the work we do in the sustainability sphere works in complete alignment with many of the SDGs.
We are proud and humbled that our work has been endorsed by the UN Climate Change Secretariat, which has confirmed that we are contributing towards the achievement of SDGs.
We have pledged to continue our efforts to bring more organisations on to the platform of climate neutrality through UN mandated offsets, and to get more organisations to align their efforts toward the SDGs.”
