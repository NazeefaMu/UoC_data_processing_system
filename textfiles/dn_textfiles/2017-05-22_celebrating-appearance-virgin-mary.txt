Celebrating the appearance of Virgin Mary

It was one hundred years ago on May 13 that Virgin Mary appeared to three little shepherd children who were grazing sheep and on this very day that the Bishop of Chilaw, Rt. Rev. Dr. Valence Mendis recalled and refreshed the minds of tens of thousands of devotees that gathered to hear their Shepherd's oration on the significance of her appearance to children. Why she chose to appear to children :- 'Because of her motherly love she showered on baby Jesus and watched him grow to childhood, perhaps like these innocent shepherd children who had taken upon themselves to tend to the sheep while their fathers and mothers strived hard to put some food on the table. They represented God's children, obedient to parents and Mary appeared to sustain their love for parents.
The Bishop further said 'All children including the ones who are stirring in their mothers' wombs must be protected. It is a sin to resort to abortions and take a life in the process of being born. We must overcome such crime that amounts to Mary represented hundred years ago and in the coming hundred years dedicate ourselves to the welfare of the young as Jesus desired :-
'Let the children come to me and do not stop them because the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to such as these' Mathew 19,13
Jesus placed his hands on their heads and went away as mother Mary watched all these in silence.
Three tender young shepherd children, Jacinta Marto, Francisco Marto and Santos were grazing their sheep at Fatima in Portugal on this significant day that was unusually balmy and peaceful with gentle breeze touching their weary brows when all of a sudden she appeared in visions to touch their innocent hearts and breathed motherly love. They were not afraid and yielded to her affection. Then she disappeared. Virgin Mary deemed to have appeared six times between May and October 1917 when Jacinta was 7, Francisco 9 and Lucia 10. Her appearances have been linked to three prophesies involving the ravage of World War 1 and the attempted assassination in Rome of Pope John II on May 13, 1981 which was the first anniversary of her apparition in Fatima.
Francisco died in 1919 and Jacinta in 1920 through an epidemic of influenza. Their cousin Lucia lived until 2005 and became a nun.
CANONISATION
In the presence of over 500,000 thousand pilgrims, Pope Francis canonized Francisco Marto and his sister Jacinta Marto as saints in the historic Sanctuary of our Lady of Fatima watched by millions around the world who watched it live on TV. It is also believed that Lucia by process will became a saint later. Thousands after the canonization, made their way to the Basilica where the tombs of Jacinta Marto and Lucia, two of the three kids who saw the Virgin Mary to pray for them.
OUR LADY OF FATIMA CHURCH
At Mudukatuwa in the Diocese of Chilaw where Rev. Vasantha Tissera is the parish priest, the holy event was commemorated. Worshippers in their thousands arrived especially to hear their gentle Shepherd, Rt. Rev. Dr. Valence Mendis deliver the sermon on the theme of the day on children.
Bishop Valence Mendis though an eloquent speaker always speak in simple language so that the poor and the not-so-literate understand his message and who make up the majority of his Diocese. Apart from them, there were hundreds who crossed-country never to miss him speak as he keeps gathering more and more to his flock because of his spiritual deliveries and devotion to God. If one is lost, he will go search for the sheep like Jesus did.
After everyone left the Fatima church, they carried with them his spiritual aura that lingered. He is truly a child of God.
