‘Sri Lanka took good measures to protect labour rights’

Sri Lanka has achieved a number of significant achievements in the labour field including preventing child labour, Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister Ravindra Samaraweera said.
The Minister was addressing the Plenary Meeting of the 107th Session of the International Labour Conference (ILC) being held in Geneva from May 28 - June 9 recently.
The Minister said Sri Lanka is the first country to implement a National Decent Work Plan (A proper work place) on par with the International Labour Organisation (ILO) principles, Minister Samaraweera said Sri Lanka is ready to share expertise with the ILO in preventing child labour.
“'Sustained, inclusive and sustainable growth' could hardly be realized without properly addressing the inequalities in the labour field,'” the Minister said.
"Sri Lanka has given priority to 'labour rights', through its inclusion in the National Human Rights Action Plan 2017-2021. Sri Lanka is introducing a 'single employment law', consolidating disparate laws and giving effect to the principle of non-discrimination. Sri Lanka, the Minister stressed, has also made strides in reducing hazardous forms of child labour, and in promoting the rights of the child, offering to share its expertise in this area to support the endeavours of the ILO. .
The Minister said the need to consider practical measures including ‘flexible working hours’, creating a positive atmosphere for women to join the labour market, thereby increasing productivity.
He noted the important role that trade unions could play in making workers understand the changing global work environment.
