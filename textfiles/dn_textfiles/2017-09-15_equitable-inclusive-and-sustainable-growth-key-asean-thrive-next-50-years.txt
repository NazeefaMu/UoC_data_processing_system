Equitable, inclusive and sustainable growth key for ASEAN to thrive in next 50 years

The ASEAN Economic Integration Forum 2017 (AEIF 2017) opened in Bangkok on September 13 with calls to promote more inclusive growth in the development of the ASEAN Community, especially by empowering women and youth as well as promoting sustainable economic development.
Over 100 regional and global participants from civil society, academia, business and government are attending AEIF 2017, organised by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), the Institute of Malaysian and International Studies (IKMAS), the World Bank Group, St. Antony’s College Oxford University and the World Trade Institute, University of Bern, Switzerland.
Opening the two-day Forum, United Nations Under-Secretary General and Executive Secretary of ESCAP Dr. Shamshad Akhtar said, “Over the past 50 years ASEAN has demonstrated the virtues and high dividends of regional cooperation, both for development and peace and security which reinforce each other. Today, ASEAN is positioned to be a key driver of further integration in the Asia Pacific region guided by the 2030 Agenda.”
"Working together and building on ASEAN’s experience, we have an opportunity to take integration in Asia and the Pacific a step further and support growth, jobs and sustainable development across Asia and the Pacific,” added Dr. Akhtar. Dr. Alan Bollard, Executive Director of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Secretariat further emphasized that both ASEAN and APEC have helped promote trade-driven growth in the past, but said, “We realise that there are different challenges ahead, so we need to learn from one another’s new approaches.”
Highlighting the role of higher education institutions to ensure continued understanding of the importance of ASEAN integration among its people, Professor Dr. Noor Azlan Ghazali, the Vice Chancellor of the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) said, “ASEAN is an important agenda of UKM, where UKM has made ASEAN Integration as one of the grand challenges in the university’s teaching and research.”
