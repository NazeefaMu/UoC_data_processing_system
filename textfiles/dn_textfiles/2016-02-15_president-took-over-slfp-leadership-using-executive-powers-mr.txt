President took over SLFP leadership using Executive Powers - MR

 
Parliamentarian Mahinda Rajapaksa said that he gave up the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) chairmanship after the Presidential election as he had no intention of splitting the party.
However he added that the SLFP leadership was taken over by President Maithripala Sirisena using his Executive Powers.
He was adderssing a meeting organized by a group of SLFP Local Council members in Negombo yesterday.
The meeting was organised following the SLFP Central Committee's decision to suspend the party membership of several Local Government members with immediate effect, it was reported.
The committee had decided to initiate disciplinary inquiries against the local councilors for allegedly acting against the party and its leadership.
Rajapaksa added that the decision of the SLFP members to work together with the United National Party (UNP) is unacceptable.
Quoting a Sinhala folk tale, he said that this is similar to the 'Gamarala'going to heaven by hanging on to the tail of an elephant.
"They are trying to see heaven by hanging on to the elephant's tail. What would happen if the Gamarala loses his grip?" he asked. Rajapaksa claimed that over 95 per cent of SLFP Local Council members attended the Negombo meeting.
