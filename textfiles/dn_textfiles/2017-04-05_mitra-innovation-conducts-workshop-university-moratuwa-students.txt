Mitra Innovation conducts workshop for University of Moratuwa students

To maximise entrepreneurial ideas by turning them into profitable businesses
Sri Lankan and UK based Mitra Innovation recently conducted a workshop at the University of Moratuwa for aspiring entrepreneurs. The workshop aimed to guide and train students on translating their innovative business ideas into viable business models, and helped them to understand what is required to deliver a flawless business ‘pitch.’
Students were required to develop unique business ideas, which they willpitch to a panel of individuals as partial fulfilment of their coursework.
During the two-and-a-half-hour workshop, Mitra Innovation – represented by Dammika Ganegama (Managing Director and Co-Founder) and Ayantha Martil (Senior Business Analyst) –provided guidance on the necessary initial research for projects, and how to present oneself on the day of a pitch.
Dammika and Ayantha also provided insight about the kinds of questions the entrepreneurs should expect from a panel.
Ayantha demonstrated a mock pitch by showing a short video to the class. The Mitra Innovation team then encouraged the students by helping them to understand that each pitch in every business pitch situation will be unique.
Dammika and Ayantha also shared hints and tips about taking part in pitches, such as the kind of posture to adopt and words that can and should be used. Mitra Innovation is honoured to have taught this very enthusiastic group of students and welcome them to the entrepreneurship/start-up world.
Dammika Ganegama said, “We were proud to play a part in inspiring the next generation of people who will be part of Sri Lanka’s future economic, entrepreneurial and IT success.”
