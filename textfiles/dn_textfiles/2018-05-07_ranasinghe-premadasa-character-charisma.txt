Former Senior Press Officer to the President reminisces
Ranasinghe Premadasa: Character of charisma

President Ranasinghe Premadasa first entered politics as a commoner. However, his intelligence and leadership qualities soon propelled him to the echelons in 1989. His former Senior Press Officer, Dr Nimal Senaratne, knew the late President well.
“President Premadasa was a man who led a good family life. However after becoming the Prime Minister and then the President, since he zealously loved his country, much of his attention was directed at governing the country and he concentrated on his presidential duties. That is the impression I had of him, and this is natural as it is with any statesman.

President Premadasa was devoted to his people and the affairs of the state. However, he intensely disliked it when his family and relatives trying to influence him when it came to the administration of the country. That is something he was very much against,” said Senaratne.
The Gam Udawa programme was instrumental in boosting the development process.
“When you build houses, you build the village. When you build houses, you build roads for the village. When you build houses, you create electricity and the water supply. The village gets a community hall. The village receives a health centre. Through the building of houses, the basic needs are addressed. That was Gam Udawa. When someone has a roof and four walls, he or she can live. This really brought the country forward. It was definitely successful. They can even grow their own crops in their garden,” stated Senaratne.
Senaratne recalls the compassionate traits in the former President. He knew how the common man toiled. He knew this because he himself had modest means.
“This is why he started his Jana Saviya programme promoting the export of garments. He told businessmen to open garment factories, telling them that he would find orders from abroad. He gave bank loans and started the opening of garment factories in rural areas. Through that, he provided jobs to those who had little or no income. The President felt that they should not be dependent on the government. It was done across the island. And true to his promise, he got orders from abroad. Garments were exported in large volumes to America in addition to other countries. This is another feature of his government. He showed kindness to those who needed kindness,” noted Senaratne.
Comprehensive knowledge of society
President Premadasa syringed a new lease of life to the rural art by establishing the Gramodaya Folk Art Centre. He drew inspiration for such a centre during a visit he made to Thailand.
“The Centre offers much relief to village-based entrepreneurs. Their products are exported. The staff, trained on the job, collect the products from across the island and unearth the relevant export market. This helps the economic development of the country. The market is both local and foreign – arts and crafts,” added Senaratne.
President Premadasa could not be fooled into anything. He was a tough personality to hoodwink as the late President knew the ways of men only too well. He had a comprehensive knowledge of society. His understanding of men was a key factor in his incredible accomplishment as a leader.
“After the 1987 Nagoya Habitat Conference, returning home to Sri Lanka, he spent some leisure time with his team in Hong Kong. At that time the former SLBC Chairman Hudson Samarasinghe was present. While having his meals, he addressed Samarasinghe and simply said – ‘Hudson no one can outsmart me. I know the nature of men and I know how the world works. I have associated with many people and cannot be misled by anyone,” recalled Senaratne.
He was not a man who went to university but he understood the common man. He was a man of the people. He became the first citizen and knew how to get the job done by delegating tasks to men and women who were capable of achieving his vision.
“He also had the invaluable assistance of his secretary Bradman Weerakoon, a capable, distinguished and accomplished man who served six Prime Ministers as secretary. He also had the assistance of K H J Wijayadasa, a resourceful man who served as his secretary after Weerakoon when he was Prime Minister. Subsequently, he became the Secretary to the President.
He immediately identified those who had the ability to get the job done. Wijayadasa brought about a very balanced leadership. In the president’s inner circle the danger is that he can be misinformed. However Premadasa was intelligent, and he together with Wijayadasa sorted matters out. He nipped the problem in the bud before it got out of control. Wijayadasa was a competent secretary. Premadasa also knew whom to depend on during his presidency. That was a very important feature of his tenure as President,” said Senaratne.
However, President Premadasa had a tough job dealing with the insurgency in the South and the LTTE problem in the North and he took certain decisions independently which did not have favourable results during peace talks.
“When President Premadasa came to power he was beset with difficulties with the insurgency in the South and the LTTE in the North. It was a job not many would have taken. But he faced his difficulties well with confidence and intelligence. The economy was falling apart due to the severity of the problems. The fact that President Premadasa faced these problems is a feature of his outstanding leadership. He faced these problems methodically and shrewdly. The conduct of international relations during his presidency was handled mainly by Bradman Weerakoon and K H J Wijayadasa under his direction,” explained Senaratne.
President Premadasa understood that the country had to be developed at the grassroots level and he wanted to start from the very bottom and move upwards. His insights into the common man helped him a lot here.
Newspaper cuttings
“Premadasa as Prime Minister was awarded Sri Lanka’s highest award to a civilian, Sri Lankabhimanya in 1986 by President J R Jayewardene who saw his potential. Even though President Premadasa had never gone to international universities he understood the needs of the common man. He understood the pulse of the people.
During his tenure as Prime Minister, one practice of Premadasa was that he reviewed the newspaper cuttings like a prayer every morning at 5 am. Here he updated himself with the happenings in the country. He expected the newspaper cuttings to be presented to him and he would learn of the various problems the people of Sri Lanka were facing. These cuttings detailed the shortcomings in the country and woes of people. He then contacted the heads of departments and asked them to immediately attend to these problems. He was tough when it came to those matters. He brought the country to a certain level,” explained Senaratne.
When it came to economic matters, understanding the importance of transport, he developed the roads and highways.
“This is essential as people need to get to work. He understood that jobs were important and provided them. He did it from the grassroots level. As President and Prime Minister, he attended to the basic needs but had little time. Owing to the problems with the LTTE, what he could do was limited. And again because of the problems in the North and South the exports of tea and rubber had fallen. Industries suffered and exports weakened. He even invited the JVP to join his leadership and asked them to work for the country,” said Senaratne.
Due to the intervention of third parties who had their own agenda, the relations between President Premadasa and Gamini Dissanayake and Lalith Athulathmudali became estranged. As a result, there was a rift between the President and these two illustrious politicians. Lalith Athulathmudali was a friend of former Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew who once told J R Jayewardene that he had better ask Athulathmudali for advice without asking him when President Jayewardene sought advice from Yew.
“So an impeachment motion was brought against President Premadasa due to the influence of these third parties. President Premadasa and these two great politicians could have worked together for the country. Premadasa faced the situation without fear. Never was his charisma more evident. He was able to win over the MPs who supported the motion bringing them to his side. Without these problems, he could have transformed this country,” pointed out Senaratne.
Prime Minister Premadasa was against the IPKF (Indian Peace Keeping Force) in Sri Lanka. He showed his opposition by not attending the signing of the Peace Accord by President Jayewardene and Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. Even Lalith Athulathmudali did not attend. Athulathmudali and Premadasa were of one mind.
“When he became President, Premadasa took a lot of effort to get rid of the IPKF. If he did not do what he did to get rid of the IPKF there would have been more problems in addition to the insurgency in the south and the LTTE threat. He understood the omens were not good. And fortunately, he succeeded in his efforts,” summed up Senaratne.
Senaratne also stated that the former President was also sensitive to journalists and showed due respect to the media. The President was ably supported in this regard by late Evans Cooray his Press Secretary.
