Wimal seeks Court permission to access newspapers while in remand

 
MP Wimal Weerawansa who is in remand custody for allegedly misusing 40 vehicles belonging to the State Engineering Corporation (SEC), today (20) urged the court to allow him newspapers in remand prison.
President's Counsel Jayantha Weerasinghe appearing for MP Weerawansa moved Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne to have his client permitted to access daily newspapers in remand prison.
“My client is a parliamentarian and expecting to address parliament. Therefore, he needs to read daily newspapers,” Defense Counsel said.
Colombo Fort Magistrate observed the magistrate did not have the jurisdiction to issue such an order in accordance with a circular issued by Judicial Service Commission.
She instructed the Defense to forward the request to the Prison Superintendent.
The Magistrate also issued an order directing the Prisons Superintendent to pay attention to the security of the MP Weerawansa, while he is in remand custody.
