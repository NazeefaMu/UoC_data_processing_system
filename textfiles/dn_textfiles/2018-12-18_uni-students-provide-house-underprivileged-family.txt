Uni students provide house to underprivileged family

A 23-member team of students from the Colombo University Management and Finance Faculty built a house for an underprivileged family of four in Polgahawela, recently. The family had been living in a small shack without basic sanitary facilities. The breadwinner of the family is a 17-year-old boy who is employed at a canteen in a factory.
A community development project is a mandatory module for first-year students of the university. The estimated cost for the project was Rs.800,000 and the necessary funds were collected by selling donation tickets and pens, organising a car wash, obtaining sponsorships and donations from well wishers, as well as through Facebook and other social media platforms.
The foundation was laid on September 10 and the house was handed over to the family on November 17.
