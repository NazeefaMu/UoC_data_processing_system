Canal blockage inundates 200 houses in Kandy

Two hundred houses were inundated due to a canal blockage in Kandy due to the heavy rains in Kandy on Saturday.
The rains resulted in the out flow of a water canal ‘Meda Ela’ being blocked due to a project which has not been properly executed.
The project has built a bridge across Meda Ela but has not re-established a smooth flowing of the canal water. The project belongs to the National Water Supply and Drainage Board.
Close to 500 families live on the sides of Meda Ela, which has become a garbage dumping site. Two cars, two vans, three trishaws and a motor bicycle were caught in the flood. The victims of the water blockage said books and other study material of students sitting for Advanced Level examination and the Grade Five Scholarship examination have also been destroyed.
Kandy City Waste Water Management Project Director Abdul Rafeek said the victims would be compensated after a proper assessment of the damage was done.
