Gota says he is US citizen and ‘no’ to PM post

Former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa admitting that he is a citizen of the United States of America, dismissed the idea of him accepting the position of Prime Minister if offered by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party.
He made this observation at the Bandaranaike International Airport on his return to Sri Lanka from United States of America last morning. His arrival follows the victory of Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), backed by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, at last Saturday's Local Government Election 2018.
Former Defence Secretary Rajapaksa responding told the media said that he is yet undecided on coming into active politics. Asked if he would accept the position of Prime Minister if offered by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, Rajapaksa said that he cannot accept such a position as he holds US citizenship.
“Am I supposed to become the Prime Minister of a government like this,?” Rajapaksa said in lighter vein.
Further questioned on his role in the present political scenario, Rajapaksa said; “I have no role to play. I am just the former Secretary of Defence.” According to sources, Rajapaksa returned to Sri Lanka from the United States via Dubai. Meanwhile, Rajapaksa extended his wishes to the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna on it’s victory at the LG polls 2018.
“People have spoken and the message is clear. The people cannot be fooled all the time. My heartfelt gratitude goes to all Sri Lankans who braved against all odds to cast their ballot for our Motherland.” Rajapaksa said in a Twitter and Facebook message.
