CPC trade unions resolve to abandon strike

 
The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) trade unions said that they have resolved to abandon plans to strike, after holding discussions with President Maithripala Sirisena today.
The CPC trade union workers and the President held discussions at the Presidential Secretariat earlier today.  
The CPC trade union workers held a strike against leasing out the Trincomalee Oil Tankers to India on July 24.
However the strike was called off after President Sirisena issued a gazette notification making fuel distribution an essential service.
