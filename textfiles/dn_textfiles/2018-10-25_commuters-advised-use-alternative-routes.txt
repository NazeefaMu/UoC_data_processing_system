Trees in danger of falling at Pahala Kadugannawa:
Commuters advised to use alternative routes

Assistant Kegalle Disaster Management Centre Director Anushka Chamila urged commuters plying between Mawanella and Kadugannawa on the Colombo - Kandy main road to use alternative routes as some trees at Pahala Kadugannawa were in danger of falling.
He said that the trees would be removed today.
The decision had been taken following a recent incident where a man had died when a tree had fallen on him in the same area.
