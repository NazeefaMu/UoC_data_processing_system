Don’t panic; sufficient Petrol available - Ministry Secretary

Petroleum Resources Development Ministry Secretary Upali Marasinghe requested the public not to panic by rumours of a petrol shortage in the country. He assured that there were sufficient stocks of petrol available around the island.
“A certain group has been spreading rumours, of a petrol shortage, around the country. In such a situation it has been reported that consumers are flocking to petrol sheds and stocking up on petrol.” I would like to note that there is no such petrol shortage in the country. Thus I request the general public not panic unnecessarily”, stated Marasinghe in a statement released to the media.
The Secretary also asked that the general public not purchase petrol from third parties at exorbitantly high prices and to purchase petrol only from licensed petrol sheds as the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation had enough stocks.
We have been able to fill all bousers which come to our warehouses with fuel promptly, he added. If there are any complaints, please direct them to 0115455130.
