Go-Jek launches services in Hanoi amid  US$500 mn overseas expansion drive

Indonesian ride-hailing firm Go-Jek on Wednesday (Sep 12) launched its services in Vietnam’s capital of Hanoi under the brand Go-Viet, as part of its US$500-million international expansion.
The app-based on-demand service Go-Viet, driven by a Vietnamese founding team, with Go-Jek providing technology, expertise and investment, offers services ranging from transport and logistics to food-delivery and mobile payments. Go-Viet grabbed a 35 per cent share of the market for motorbike ride-hailing services in the economic hub of Ho Chi Minh City just six weeks after launching there on Aug 1, Go-Jek founder and chief executive Nadiem Makarim said.
“We are proud to have seen positive development in Ho Chi Minh City market, and this paves the way for us to expand our services to Hanoi,” Go-Viet co-founder and managing director Nguyen Vu Duc said at Wednesday’s launch.
The launch followed an announcement by the company in May that it would invest US$500 million to enter the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, following Uber’s deal to sell its Southeast Asian operations to bigger regional player Grab. On Tuesday, Grab announced a partnership with Vietnam’s MOCA Technology and Service company (Moca) for a mobile payment service, as the ride-hailing firm pushes to cement its position.
