Alleged assassination plot against President, Gota
IGP questioned for three hours

Inspector General of Police Pujith Jayasundara was summoned to the Criminal Investigation Department yesterday where his statement was recorded for over three hours. This is over the alleged plot to assassinate President Maithripala Sirisena and former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
Speaking to the Daily News, IGP Pujith Jayasundara confirmed that he was summoned and a statement was recorded for three hours.
“This is part of the ongoing investigation and I was there to deliver my statement. It is not over, it is very likely I will be summoned again to complete my statement,” he said.
This is the first time that the IGP has been summoned over the case. When the revelations by Director Operations) of Anti-Corruption Movement, Namal Kumara, came to head earlier this year, the IGP ordered that an immediate preliminary investigation be carried out by his Special Investigation Unit.
Upon the submission of its initial report, the case was vested with the CID for a thorough probe. It was during these investigations that former Director of the Terrorist Investigation Unit and Deputy Inspector General of Police Nalaka de Silva was arrested for his involvement which was implicated through the phone call recordings. The former DIG has been remanded until December 5.
