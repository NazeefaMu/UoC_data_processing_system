MEPA, Coca-Cola celebrates World Environmental Day

The Marine Environmental Protection Authority (MEPA), under the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment, in partnership with Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd. (CCBSL) celebrated World Environment Day with a Mangrove Cleaning Program at Negombo Lagoon on May 30.
The initiative encompassed three sites of Kings Island, Pitipana Road and the Ferry Harbour in Negombo, where the mangroves are located. The event was a complete success and witnessed participation of approximately 800 participants across Government, NGOs, CBOs, universities and community, with the private sector being represented by Coca-Cola.
CCBSL launched its custom Coca-Cola “Give Back Life” PET recycling bins. Effective partnership with the government ensures the coverage and efficiency of PET recovery and recycling schemes led by volunteer mobilisation in key locations of national importance from a biodiversity and ecosystem standpoint, such as this collection program with MEPA.
Commenting on the occasion Rear Admiral (RTD) Rohana Perera - Chairman, Marine Environmental Protection Authority (MEPA), added, “Mangroves are key to healthy coastal ecosystems but are increasingly under threat. The Mangrove Cleaning Program was an apt initiative to drive awareness of the need to nurture mangroves.”
Mayank Arora - Managing Director, CCBSL said, “Coca-Cola is the beverage industry leader and is committed to spearhead the way in finding solutions for problems impacting our environment.
Our global goal is to help collect and recycle a bottle or can for everyone we sell by 2030 and we will work with the Government, NGOs and civil society bodies to achieve this goal. We are proud to partner with The Marine Environmental Protection Authority (MEPA) yet again following last year’s National Coastal and Marine Resources Conservation Week clean-up where we collected and recycled over 35,000 PET plastic bottles.”
Deeply engaged in driving environmental protection and conservation initiatives, Coca-Cola works with a host of partners in and will continue to do so in the coming years to deliver its global “World Without Waste” packaging vision, which includes collecting and recycling a bottle for everyone it sells globally by 2030 and renewing its focus on the entire packaging lifecycle.
