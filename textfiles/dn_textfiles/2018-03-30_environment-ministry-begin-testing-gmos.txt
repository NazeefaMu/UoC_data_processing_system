Environment Ministry  to begin testing GMOs

The Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry will be setting up a bio-safety screening procedure to test the safety of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) coming into the country.
“In the future, we will make evidence-based and need-based decisions on GMOs,” said Bio-safety National Project Manager Shanaka Gunawardena.
He was speaking at the ceremonial project launch at the Water’s Edge in Battaramulla on Thursday.
Sri Lanka signed an international GMO screening protocol in 2000 and ratified it in 2004. Since then, Parliament also drafted a Bio-safety Act in 2014, but it is yet to be enacted. According to the Secretary to the Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry Anura Dissanayake, the country still does not have a sufficient capacity or a functional administrative and operational system to establish bio-safety.
It’s important to test the safety of GMOs now, he said, as “climate change, changing rain patterns, and periods of drought” affect traditional crop yields. The new bio-safety project is supported with funding from the Global Environment Facility and technical support from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, according to a Ministry press release. GMOs, or Genetically Modified Organisms, are animals or plants whose genes have been modified for different properties. Over 90 percent of India’s cotton crop, for example, is GM cotton modified to be pest-resistant.
“This is a fantastic technology,” said Professor Athula Perera, the Coordinator of the National Bio-safety Framework Project. “It can transfer characteristics across species, across kingdoms.”
But critics warn that GM crops can introduce unforeseen consequences into the environment and the people who consume them.
“Of course there is a risk,” Professor Perera acknowledged. “But we need to get together and use this technology … while ensuring a safe and healthy nation.”
