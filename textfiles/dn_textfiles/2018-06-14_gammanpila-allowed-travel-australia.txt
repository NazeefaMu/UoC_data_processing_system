Gammanpila allowed to travel to Australia

The Colombo High Court yesterday permitted Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader MP Udaya Gammanpila to travel to Australia for a month.
MP Gammanpila, whose passport was impounded by Court for allegedly cheating Rs. 20 million and misappropriation another Rs. 21 million following his alleged fraudulent share transaction, had sought the Colombo High Court’s permission to temporarily lift his travel ban.
Accordingly, his passport was ordered to be released on a personal bond of Rs.100,000 by High Court Judge A. A. R. Heiyanthuduwa.
The Court was informed through the defence counsel that the son of Udaya Gammanpila is being treated at a hospital in Australia following a road accident.
President's Counsel Jayantha Weerasinghe appearing for MP Gammanpila moved the High Court that his client be allowed to travel to Australia between June 19 and July 19.
