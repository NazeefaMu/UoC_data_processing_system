Are ‘A’ tours,  Development Squads  serving the purpose?

 
Sri Lanka today finds itself short of quality players who are match-winners to serve in the national cricket team and that is not because there is dearth of talent in the country but due to a whole lot of things that are wrong with the present system and needs to be overhauled.
Currently Sri Lanka does not have a procedure to fast-track exceptional talent that is oozing out of the schools and put them under special and high quality training at the highest level so that they can be straight away drafted into the senior team.
A clear example is the fast-tracking of England batsman Joe Root who was sent to the Darren Lehmann Academy in Adelaide early in his career to fine tune his game where he went through a tough training schedule the results of which we are seeing today.
A case in point in Sri Lanka is batsman Kusal Mendis who has virtually graduated from under 19 level to play Test cricket at the age of 21. Mendis’ progress clearly shows that the country is not starved of talent but the process of picking out the rare gem that is available is all wrong.
We have in this country a unique position where 800 plus schools are playing cricket which means you are delivering around 8,000 to 10,000 cricketers from the nursery. Whether all of them are quality you cannot say. But the biggest asset is they have become our stock and all of them have taken a huge liking to the game where there is a massive following from the junior cricket stage with parents, coaches, supports etc all getting involved. Some top schools like Royal, S. Thomas’, Richmond, Ananda, Nalanda, St Peter’s and St Joseph’s are having as many as 4-5 teams at junior level – under 13, 15, 17, 19 sometimes even two under 19 teams A and B.
The question that needs to be asked is: Are we going to lose this talent. We can’t afford the risk of losing this natural base which has been created post 1996 World Cup to a large extent. This established base must be protected and for its protection we need to have a system of recognition. At present we seem to be following the old system of having Development squads, ‘A’ teams etc and on the other hand our first-class domestic tournament is not competitive enough. The question is whether the age old system of ‘A’ teams and Development squad teams are serving the purpose? From the current ‘A’ team touring England how many of them will play for Sri Lanka?
In the ‘A’ team there are average performers within the club system who also try to vie for places. Whether they are good enough to play at national level is a moot question. An ’A’ team at present also serves the purpose for players who have been in the national team and for reason of loss of form or injury they have been dropped from the senior side. They use the ‘A’ squad as a platform to try and score runs or take wickets to try and regain their places in the senior side. If there is another youngster vying for the same place as the discarded cricketer would he encourage that youngster and help him improve his cricket is questionable.
On those grounds we should not abandon ‘A’ teams but we got to have some radicalised thinking to fast track and get some absolute talent to boost the national side. We have to weed out the real class and once a player is fast-tracked these exceptionally talented cricketers should not got through the process of playing in Development Squads and ‘A’ teams but sent for specialised training abroad like England did with Joe Root. Then we may find an odd Jayasuriya or Muralitharan somewhere.
One of the under 19 cricketers that is strongly spoken of is all-rounder Charith Asalanka so is fast bowler Asitha Fernando. Another is batsman Minod Bhanuka. All of them are members of the Sri Lanka ‘A’ team touring England. There are also players like Sammu Ashan, Ashen Bandara and Avishka Fernando currently playing in the ongoing under 19 series against South Africa.
A good example is the case of spinner Akila Dananjaya whom Mahela Jayawardene recommended as a bright prospect for the national team. But after a handful of matches Dananjaya is not even heard of in the club circuit. This is where the system fails where the rare talent is not tapped properly and given the necessary platform to make a permanent place in the senior team because the follow-up is not there.
Picking a young schoolboy cricketer and sending him to play in some league team in England or Australia is not going to help his cricket. He should be sent to an academy where mental toughness, professionalism, fitness etc are all grilled into the individual. It’s not just going out and batting and bowling in the centre. Most of our cricketers don’t have these fundamentals and they are totally absent from their cricket.
Kusal Mendis is an exception. We see something on the lines of mental toughness, professionalism and fitness. His approach in the middle and his ability to score 25-40 runs staying at the crease in the first few overs is a big boon.
There have been efforts to run a provincial tournament but at the moment it won’t work because every cricketer is coming to Colombo for his livelihood and then they want to cling onto a Colombo club. To get over this shortcoming Sri Lanka Cricket is developing the infrastructure in the provinces which is good,
What Sri Lanka Cricket should clearly understand is that all the cricketers who play at domestic level have economic issues and the first opportunity they get they will grab because they want job security. Either they are going to be employed and play cricket or they will look at opportunities to play league and district in England or Australia. Currently we have about 300 cricketers who are playing cricket outside Sri Lanka. They have gone out of the system because that is their livelihood. So SLC has to do something out of the ordinary to tap this talent and ensure that they deliver. Eventually at the end of the day whether it is a Jayasuriya, Sangakkara, Mahela, Murali, Dias, Aravinda or Arjuna it is the talent that has delivered. These players had raw talent.
