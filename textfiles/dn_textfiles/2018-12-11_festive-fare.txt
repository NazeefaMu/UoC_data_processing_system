Festive  fare

Christmas and New Year are times of the year when schools take things easy by letting their students indulge in the holiday cheer. The children of Polymath College Nursery School celebrated Christmas early at the dawn of their December vacation together with their seniors - the students of Polymath College.
Though it was the first time on stage for many of the tiny tots of Polymath Kids and the students of Polymath College, they children displayed an abundance of talent and confidence as they sang and swayed to the Christmas tunes and songs at their end of the year concert.
Polymath College Principal Upali Gunasekera noted that the staff members had worked tirelessly to train the children for the event. He thanked all of them for their efforts in encouraging the children not only in their academic work but also to showcase their aesthetic talents on stage. Staff members, parents, siblings, grandparents and other well wishers were also present. The event was also shown live on the web.
