NMSJ praises SC ruling

The National Movement for Social Justice (NMSJ) yesterday urged the public to participate in today’s protest rally in Colombo against the removal of the former Prime Minister and other recent events.
Addressing a news briefing, Co-Convener of the Purawesi Balaya Organization Gamini Viyangoda said that under the previous Government the independent bodies were not appointed to approve any decision taken by the President but, to act independently for the sake of the country. He said that they were satisfied to have a very fair verdict from the Supreme Court.
Co-Convener of the Purawesi Balaya Organization Saman Rathnapriya said the former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe should now be accepted as the legal Prime Minister of the country as the present Government has no majority in Parliament.
He said the President was unable to protect the Constitution of the country. It was up to the public representatives in the Parliament to decide on further action in this regard, he added.
Ven. Dambara Amila and Attorney-at-Law Ravi Jayawardhane also expressed their views on this occasion.
