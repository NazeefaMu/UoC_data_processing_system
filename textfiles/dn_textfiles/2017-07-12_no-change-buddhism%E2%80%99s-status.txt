No change in Buddhism’s status

The Constitutional Reform process is very much in the news these days, with the focus centred on the place given to Buddhism. The various rumours circulating to the effect that the new Constitution will essentially be a secular one with no special place for Buddhism have come out of nowhere and have no basis in fact. All other leading religious dignitaries have also said they have absolutely no problem with Buddhism having the foremost place since it is the majority religion in the country.
President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Buddha Sasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe have all reiterated that the foremost place given to Buddhism by the Constitution will not see any change in the upcoming new Constitution. (This clause was included in the 1972 new Republican Constitution).
They gave this reassurance following a statement issued by the three Mahanayake Theras that Sri Lanka does not need a new Constitution at the moment and whatever the outcome, the foremost place accorded to Buddhism should not be changed.
Having noted the concerns expressed by the Most Ven. Mahanayake Theras, Government spokesmen noted that the people have given a mandate to the Government to make Constitutional amendments and/or bring a new Constitution. In fact, they pointed out that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa too had made this very same promise in both 2010 and 2014-15 Presidential Elections, even though the Joint Opposition de-facto led by Rajapaksa has now decided to withdraw from the Constitution making process. Minister Dr Rajitha Senaratne explained that the Maha Sangha’s voice too was represented in the mandate given to the Government in January 2015 and subsequently in August that year.
Constitutional Reform
The most eloquent statement in support of Constitutional Reform was made not by a Government spokesman, but by the JVP’s Bimal Ratnayake who lucidly explained that the Government has received a clear mandate from the people for the same. Therefore, the Government must go ahead with the process, he said. This had more credibility in the eyes of the public because the JVP does not see eye to eye with the Government on many other issues. But on this issue, both the Government and the JVP are on the same note which portends well for the new Constitution.
On a related but slightly different note, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said on Saturday he would come up with a new proposal to include provisions in the Constitution that would prohibit Governments from interfering with internal matters of three main Buddhist Chapters.
The Prime Minister was speaking at the opening of the Weli Maluwa at Ruwan Weliseya in Anuradhapura over the weekend. He reminded the audience of how the previous regime interfered with the various functions and pronouncements of the Maha Sangha. He also sought a comprehensive plan for the long-term conservation of Maha Viharaya premises in the Anuradhapura Sacred area. While the Prime Minister did nor refer directly to the controversy over the “pin petti” (donation boxes) at places of worship, several senior monks including the chief incumbent of the Atamastana (eight sacred places of worship in Anuradhapura), Ven. Pallegama Sirinivasa Thera has cleared the air saying the sealing of donation boxes and auditing was a routine affair and not a new phenomenon as the Opposition claims it to be.
PM 40 years in Parliament
This year marks a personal and political milestone for Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, who is also the leader of the United National Party (UNP). He completes 40 years in Parliament this year. (His political career extends a few more years). He was elected to Parliament from the Biyagama seat at the 1977 General Election. President J.R. Jayewardene appointed him as Deputy Foreign Minister and a few months later as Minister of Youth Affairs and Employment, which made him the youngest Cabinet minister at that time. He later became Education Minister. He has the distinction of serving as the Prime Minister on three occasions (1993-1994/2001-2004 and 2015 to date). He faced several challenges to his leadership in the UNP but emerged unscathed and stronger each time. He is one of the prime architects of the present Yahapalana (Good Governance) Government led by President Maithripala Sirisena. The two leaders have a sound understanding and relationship which helps take the Government forward, despite the dissenting views expressed by spokesmen for the two parties (UNP and SLFP) in several instances.
Next week marks the 40th anniversary of an equally significant event in Sri Lankan political history. The UNP won the 1977 General Election held on July 21 by a five-sixth majority (140 seats), reducing the SLFP to just eight seats and making the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) the main Opposition party with 18 seats. The CWC won just one seat. The UNP obtained a total of 3,179,221 valid votes while the SLFP obtained 1,855,331 votes. Since the election was held on the first-past-the-post system, the TULF which got only 421,488 votes got 18 seats and the main opposition.
The architect of this massive victory was the late President J.R. Jayewardene, who became Sri Lanka’s first executive President the following year. The UNP, which suffered a humiliating setback in 1970, made an amazing turnaround just seven years later, riding on the back of the massive unpopularity of the SLFP-led coalition Government of Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike.
The UNP is planning to hold meetings and awareness programmes islandwide to mark this victory that led to an unprecedented socio-economic revolution in the country, rivalling the 1956 upheaval. The open economy was the biggest change. Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka said their mission was to educate a whole generation of youth who had not witnessed this event to learn more about it and to invite them to march forward with the UNP.
Uma Oya project
Uma Oya was the other issue that grabbed the headlines last week. The Government has now decided to go ahead with the project which is 70 percent complete, but with a better compensation formula for affected residents. Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, a member of the ministerial subcommittee appointed by the President to probe the Uma Oya project said it was the first-ever project undertaken by Iranian contractor FARAB and the machinery used in excavating the 18-kilometer tunnel was not suitable for such work. According to the Minister, the Cabinet subcommittee has recommended that excavation work be suspended to obtain modern excavators to minimise the damage caused to the environment and to ground water resources. Norwegian experts will visit Sri Lanka shortly to study the project. However, the Minister said the number of damaged houses has been vastly exaggerated.
The Government will introduce the ‘Super LARC’ (Land Acquisition and Resettlement Committees) system of compensation to those affected by the Uma Oya Multipurpose Development Project, Minister Amaraweera said. The Minister said the government has recognised a total of 52 houses which are not suitable to live in due to the project and they are being granted compensation. Under the Super LARC system, the affected residents would receive premium compensation. LARCs were introduced in 2013 to decide on compensation for those losing private property for road development, railway development and other development projects. An additional Rs 300 million has also been released to the Badulla District Secretariat to settle compensation claims.
Last week, the Government was also busy contradicting claims by the Opposition and some media rights groups that it was planning to bring tighter controls on the media. This issue has come to the fore after certain news outlets said the Government was planning to introduce an “Independent Council for News Media Standards Act” draft bill. Gayantha Karunathilake, the previous media minister, has gone on record saying the President, Prime Minister or the Government intends to do anything which penalises, restricts or influences media freedom in any way.
The Minister told the media that “one has to consider the factor of raising the standards. The Government does not intend on passing any law by force. It was made clear that these matters should be carried out independently. It was also decided that this should be done in consultation with the public, media organisations and media heads and in a way that we can come to a consensus”. Many Ministers and MPs have denied any knowledge of seeing or discussing such a document in any form. They said the Government has no intention whatsoever of penalising journalists. Minister and Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said the era of white vanning and murdering journalists was over in the country. There will be no room for any steps to curb the media, he said.
Meanwhile, the media witnessed one of the most high profile applications for the Right to Information (RTI) last week. For the first time, the Pilots Guild of SriLankan is using the provisions of the Right to Information Act to find out more details about the salaries paid to top officials at SriLankan Airlines, which is facing huge losses. The Government is keen to seek a partner for the ailing airline to revive its fortunes. The Pilots Guild has sought details on the salaries paid to the CEO, Head of Human Resources and the Chief Commercial Officer in addition to details on the Pakistan International Airlines’ short-lived deal with SriLankan, the cancellation of Airbus A350 orders and the Airbus A320 jet conversion. This is likely to be a litmus test for the use of RTI law in Sri Lanka since SriLankan’s dealings have often been mired in secrecy. Besides the Pilots Guild, members of the public too have a right to know about these issues.
SAITM issue
With regard to the SAITM issue, last week was more calm than usual. There was some drama on Monday when Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) Chief Prof. Carlo Fonseka pleaded with Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) not to launch any strike supposedly in support of him. Earlier, there was speculation that he could be replaced by another health professional who could be having a more favourable view on SAITM. The doctors’ strike, postponed last week by one week, was to take place today or tomorrow. The GMOA has not officially issued a statement on this matter at the time we went to press.
Dengue, which used to be only a health issue, has now taken on a political significance with the Opposition saying the non-functioning of Local Government Bodies and hence, the problems associated with garbage collection, have aggravated the problem. However, Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka, who has been tasked with the responsibility of resolving the garbage issue by the President, expressed confidence that the issue could be resolved in a few months the most. As for Local Government Bodies, most political analysts are now pointing to a possible date in November for the LG elections islandwide.
Stay orders issued on disposal of garbage will worsen the crisis with regard to the collection and disposal of waste, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe told Parliament. He was responding to JVP MP Bimal Ratnayake who informed him about the stay order issued by the Supreme Court on disposing of garbage at Muturajawela. “Stay orders will create more issues especially at a time when diseases such as dengue are spreading,” the Prime Minister said.
Meanwhile, a tax will be imposed on abandoned lands in the Western Province which are not cleaned of dengue breeding sites as a measure to curb the massive spread of dengue, says Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya. According to the Chief Minister, a two percent tax for the land value will be imposed on abandoned lands in the Western Province in accordance with the Local Government Ordinance. The taxation policy, Devapriya explained was already present but few people knew of its existence as it had not been enforced in a systematic manner in the past. He explained that a large number of dengue breeding grounds were found in abandoned lands and that the tax could be imposed multiple times if action was not taken to clean up by the relevant owners. The authorities also have the power to acquire the land if the tax is not paid.
This is a step in the right direction. Political will and tougher laws are certainly needed to resolve the dengue crisis.
This column also notes with sorrow the passing of respected senior journalist and political analyst Prabhath Weeraratne, a professional colleague and a classmate of this writer at Ananda College, Colombo. Prabhath had a unique insight to political developments and was a treasure trove of knowledge on a variety of subjects. He moved closely with politicians from all sides but also found the time to report on ordinary man’s issues. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Ministers and a large number of politicians, civil society activists, journalists, public servants and readers paid last respects to Prabhath at his Mulleriyawa residence. It will not be easy to fill the journalistic void left by Prabhath, just 48 at the time of his untimely demise.
