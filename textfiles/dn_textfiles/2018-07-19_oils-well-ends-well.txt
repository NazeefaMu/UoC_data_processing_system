OIL'S WELL THAT  ENDS WELL

Though there is no easy cure for preventing your skin from producing too much oil, there are ways to control this skin condition. Oily skin usually requires its own range of products so you need to make adjustments suited for oily skin types. Get rid of the excessive shine by following these guidelines.
Identifying oily skin
Oily skin will feel greasy and shiny all over. If you feel like you are constantly reaching for the oil blotting sheets, this means you probably have oily skin. Other signs to look out for are:
You have enlarged pores in your T-Zone.
You notice breakouts.
You get blackheads.
Your skin rarely feels tight or dry.
Causes
Many people suffer from oily or greasy skin for various reasons. Oily skin is caused by excess production of the skin’s natural oils known as sebum. These occurrences of excess oil are often genetic traits but can also be influenced by changes in hormone production and the products we consume.
Diet: Foods high in sugar, refined carbohydrates and the aforementioned dairy can lead to overactive sebum production and the accompanying greasy look.
Genes: Sometimes, you just can’t fight genetics. Oily skin is by no means something that only affects those predisposed to it, but like anything, some people will always just have naturally oilier skin by default as inheritance from their parents.
Hormones: Imbalances in hormone levels caused by anything from diet, exercise, menstruation, pregnancy, birth control, or menopause can cause excess oil production.
Acne and oily skin
All types of skin can develop whiteheads, blackheads and pimples. Acne tends to develop when an oily substance called sebum produced by sebaceous (oil-making) glands mixes with dead skin cells and other debris to plug pores and cause bacteria to thrive.
Make up for oily skin
First and foremost, investing in oil-free makeup should be your top priority, and with that comes the responsibility of prepping your skin beforehand. To get that sebum under control, a primer is an absolute must. It not only helps control oil production and makes your skin look smoother, but it also acts as glue to hold your makeup in place for long hours.
Skin care routine for oily skin
It is an obvious one, but it’s worth repeating: cleansing the skin is a vital step for oily skin types. Wash your face two to three times today depending on how much you have sweat in order to clear the oily buildup and keep your pores clear.
Look for a gentle cleanser free of sulfates and other harsh ingredients that can dry out your skin and cause it to produce more oil to compensate. Cleansers that contain benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, glycolic acid, or beta-hydroxy acid can help with clearing up acne and blackheads. If you aren’t able to run to the bathroom with your facewash, then be sure to keep the blotting sheets close at hand. Simply absorbing some of the oil throughout the day will really help keep the shine down.
While the first instinct if you have oily skin is to avoid any moisturizer or oil on the market, oily skin is actually in vital need of moisture because a lack of moisture can actually spur oil production in the skin, thereby worsening the problem. The key is to look for lightweight water-based moisturizers that are oil-free and non-comedogenic (meaning it won’t clog pores). Renée Rouleau, skin care expert and esthetician, advises looking for a formula with “glycerin and sodium hyaluronate, a water-based hydrator that keeps skin cells plump with water.”

Diet for those with oily skin  Making changes to your diet can be overwhelming at first so it’s best to take gradual steps. Try replacing one food type, then another once you’ve got used to the first swap, and so on.l Swap dairy products for: Dairy-free alternatives like almond milk and vegan cheese. If you’re worried about your calcium intake, leafy green vegetables, almonds, and oranges will all provide the nutrients you need.l Swap refined carbohydrates for: Wholemeal bread, brown rice, wholemeal pasta, quinoa, and oats. These foods are much less processed and have higher levels of fibre, too. They keep your blood sugar levels more stable, which means your energy levels are steadier.l Swap sugary foods for: Berries, mangos, frozen bananas, good quality dark chocolate, water with fresh lemon and/or lime. l Swap alcohol for water or low-sugar virgin cocktail: Alcohol can also cause you to sweat and eat fatty foods, both actions which can lead to clogged pores. It’s all too tempting not to wash your face when you get home after you’ve had a few, which can make oil slicks worse and give your skin a greasy look.If you can’t quite quit the habit, try to stick to clearer alcoholic drinks such as vodka and drink a glass of water in between each alcoholic drink to keep hydrated.
