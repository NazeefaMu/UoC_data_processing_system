Bharatha Natyam Dance marks International Dance Day

The Indian Cultural Centre, High Commission of India, Colombo will be organizing a folk and Bharatha Natyam performances by the students of Natya Kala Mandhi at the Cultural Centre auditorium located at 16/2, Gregory’s Road, Colombo 07 under the guidance of their guru Kalasuri Vasugy Jegatheeswaran on April 29 at 6 pm.
Kalasuri Vasugy Jegatheeswaran received her initial training in Bharatha Natyam under her mother Vijayalakshmi Shanmugampillai and later in India under Padmashri Adyar K Lakshman.
She has been teaching dance over three decades and produced several dance dramas and her students have presented several classical performances in Sri Lanka and abroad. In 1990 the Government of Sri Lanka conferred on her the prestigious title of Kalasuri for the service she has rendered in the field of dance.
Vasugy has been teaching at the Indian Cultural Centre since June 2005. She is also teaching classical dance at the Holy Family Convent, Bambalapitiya.
International Dance Day was introduced in 1982 by the International Dance Council (CID, Conseil International de la Danse), a UNESCO partner NGO, and is celebrated yearly, on April 29. The date is not linked to a particular person or a particular form of dance, although it's also the day when the French dancer and ballet master Jean-Georges Noverre was born. The main purpose of Dance Day events is to attract the attention of the wider public to the art of dance. Emphasis should be given to addressing a new public, people who do not follow dance events during the course of the year.
Every year, the president of the International Dance Council sends the official message for Dance Day which circulate in every country around the world.
