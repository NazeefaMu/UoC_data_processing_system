Serve up restaurant-quality meals at home

Restaurant kitchens run like well-oiled machines. The equipment is heavy-duty, the tools are the perfect ones for the job, and the cooks know every recipe like the back of their hand!
But it is not just about the skills and the tools, it’s also about the ingredients used that can really elevate and transform a dish.
When dining in restaurants, coffee-shops, hotels, cafes and bakeries, we savour various flavours and tastes which are carefully blended together to give us a perfect experience of the food, making us want more.
Anchor as a brand has long been highly-regarded in Sri Lanka. For many years it has stood for uncompromised premium quality dairy products that meet both personal and professional needs.
Fonterra’s very own Chef Jamie Aserappa, who works with leading international hotel chains, bakeries and cafes on customizing dairy solutions, demonstrates how complex restaurant-type dishes can be made at the comfort of your home using the same high quality dairy ingredients.
For example, a simple pasta dish can be elevated with a delicious cheese sauce made using Anchor Butter, Cooking Cream and the latest introduction to Sri Lankan home cooks, world-renowned cooking cheese brand Perfect Italiano’s Grated Parmesan Cheese.
Gnocchi – a complex Italian dish can be made just as light and fluffy asin a restaurant using a mix of Anchor Butter, Cooking Cream and Cheeses.
And for dessert, use Anchor Whipping Cream, Butter and UHT milk to make indulgent treatssuch as a rich and creamy Crème Brulee or get creative with the Strawberry ‘Mookie’ - an innovative treat for loved ones.
