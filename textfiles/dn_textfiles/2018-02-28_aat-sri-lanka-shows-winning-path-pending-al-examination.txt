AAT Sri Lanka shows winning path with pending A/L examination

AAT Sri Lanka is one of the most sought after professional courses to which registrations are accepted with pending O/L results. The qualification paves the path to students to sit for their A/L examination with more confidence and be equipped with a vast knowledge which definitely is an advantage to cross the A/L hurdle with flying colours.
According to AAT Sri Lanka CEO Tishanga Kumarasingha, fifty three top places out of the Best 100 in the island including six places among the top ten had been achieved by AAT students, while the district first places of twelve districts also had been achieved by AAT students.
He further stated that, the main reason behind these victories is that the AAT scope of study goes so parallel with the A/L subject stream while providing opportunities for the students to revise the difficult subject matters over and over again until they get firm on it. It has been evident through the results of other professional examinations as well, that AAT passed finalists, after getting stage and subject exemptions from these institutes, perform exceptionally well, incurring a relatively less investment in money and time as well. “what we have observed throughout these years is that those who finish AAT qualification even before they sit for their A/L examinations, are ahead of other students who actually wait till the A/L finishes to start their professional education journey”, stated the CEO.
Registrations are open for July 2018 examinations of AAT, he also wished to remind all students who wish to achieve more in their lives to join the next crew of true achievers with AAT.
