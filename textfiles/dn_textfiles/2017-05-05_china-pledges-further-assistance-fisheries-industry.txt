China pledges further assistance to fisheries industry

 
The Chinese government has pledged technical and training assistance to further elevate fisheries industry in Sri Lanka, the Fisheries and Aquatic Resource Ministry said.
The agreement comes after a meeting between Chinese Agriculture Acting Minister Chen Xiaohua and Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera.
While China is already assisting Sri Lanka in many fisheries and aquatic resources development projects, the Chinese Acting Minister had pledged to support the breeding centre to be built in Batticaloa, and to especially provide technical support to breeding sea leeches.
Fisheries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said the government had decided to carry out development projects in 116 lagoons in the coastal line through private and public investors, since fisheries in lagoons yield high crops.
