Tanks in Addalaichenai under renovation

Renovating the Karadikulam and Padarakal tanks in the Addalaichenai DS division is nearing completion, Irrigation Engineer T. Mayooran said.
The renovation is carried out by the Addalaichenai Irrigation Unit in the Akkaraipattu Irrigation region under the ‘Climate Resilience Improvement Project’, he said.
The Karadikulam tank was damaged in the Tsunami 2002 and Rs.10 million were spent to renovate the tank, Irrigation Engineer T. Mayooran said.
All projects will be complete before the Maha season, he said.
Farmers of Karadikulam West Kandam and Karadikulam East Kandam in the Akkaraipattu Regional Engineer’s division will receive the benefit of the new projects, he said. Akaraipattu farmers have undergone severe difficulties and no action was taken to address their issues in the past.
They thank the government officials for carrying out development works in their regions to address the issues.
About 750 acres of paddy lands would be cultivated during the Yala and Maha seasons via the new tanks. Irrigation Engineer T. Mayooran said.
