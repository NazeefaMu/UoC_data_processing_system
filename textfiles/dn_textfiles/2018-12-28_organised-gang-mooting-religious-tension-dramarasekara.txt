Organised gang mooting religious tension - Dr.Amarasekara

Foreign powers are planning to deploy an international peace keeping army into the country to solve a tense situation among religions, to be created artificially and thereby divide the country, the Federation for National Organizations said yesterday.
They said damaging Buddha statues in different areas of the country is an intended attempt by an organized gang to create religious tension situation among the different religions.
The members of the Federation stated this addressing media in Rajagiriya yesterday.
Dr.Gunadasa Amarasekara addressing the press conference said the Ava Group functioning in the North is also an extension of the LTTE organization, which fought for a separate state. It is led by a rehabilitated LTTE member.
Therefore, Amarasekara urged the government to probe into the damaging of Buddha Statues and eliminate all possible ways leading to communal and religious tensions.
Amarasekara also accused the government led by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe saying that his government was appointed in 2015 by the foreign powers to divide the country through a new Constitution.
The international powers had taken this new initiative to divide the country when their plan to bring a new Constitution was defeated, he added.
Ven.Maduru Oye Dhammissara Thera speaking on this occasion requested President Maithripala Sirisena to appoint a Presidential Commission to look into the damages that have been done to the archeologically valuable sites by organised gangs during the recent past.
Conducting such a investigation by a Presidential Commission would help to minimise the possible damages in the future, the Thera added.International news analyst and critic, Mohan Samaranayake and Dr. Wasantha Bandara also addressed the occasion.
