Can anyone stop Kandy?

December for us islanders is a compulsive time in every sense ..it’s those traditions that give us time to reflect and thoughts about others and sharing ....
Wellness and planning, keys to enjoying the season and absorbing its goodness ..
Fitting then that our rugby warriors step away from their boot sweat, favourite playing kit, those quirky superstitions that know no bounds.
We control our endearing and sometimes inexplicable passion, deeper than emotion and beyond expectations, with latent fear?
Rugby players drive on adrenaline and an appetite for pain and skill, that beggars description.
The Dialog season in Sri, temporary on hold for the festive jollies and a few determined hugs ...a massive welcome relief for players and management alike.
Time off to recover from injury, plan numbers, examine combinations, asses performance, fitness and finish.. Factors and specifics that eventually control the destiny of each squad with ambitions greater than their club house!
Kandy has held their own, dictating the pace and enjoying the big W's, week after week..
If anything, only CH and Havies, putting pressure on their glittering back division ..led by the enormously skilled Fazil, captain Weeraratne, Nigel Ratwatte, Wiliweera, Richie D, Mr finisher himself, Danushka Ranjan.
What silk and pearls for the lions to reap and reward ..especially consider, Srinath spirits B ..on the bench ...and u, send a utility player?
They are 40 points and sitting very pretty as no. 1 in the rankings, Havelocks 29, Army 25, etc..
The million dollar question for all of us including our much sought after experts, in their social media armchairs...is ...who will beat Kandy in the final round? Who is strong enough to outplay and sharp enough to outwit the upcountry boys in the next 2 months?
CR, Navy, Havelocks and CH have the players ...but can they play as a unit ..and match the defending champs for 80mins ....contain the try hunger and dominate up front?
Gaming professionals take heart, breathe deep and the mesmerizing possibility of a new league champion? What a tantalizing conclusion to the 2018.dialog season..??
Round 2 for Havies, Navy, Army, CR and CH ..means anything is possible ..so it's the belief on the day that dictates an acceptable finish ..with no fixed assurances....Or winners as yet..
All told it's a massive ask to clock up the big Ws and beat Kandy’s impressive round 1 form and bonus bank...
Our pondering pundits will be itching with great delight to contemplate probable match results between the top 5 ......safe to wish the pundits island luck with the predictions?
Our Asian jnr rugby confrontation with Hong Kong for a passage to the jnr world cup ..ended as it began ..quietly and with clinical wins for HK, without much fuss.
The islanders never looked threatening at any stage during both matches ..losing by 37 points at the Racecourse, and by 40 points in Kowloon last Saturday.
The prospects for jnr rugby in Sri and at Asia level is singularly massive ..but needs investing big and efficient planning for 5 years ahead ...its crying to be fixed and needs to eradicate haphazard temporary thinking with immediate effect.
We must focus our resources and acumen on upgrading the whole jnr international rugby approach...aim to get our high performance status, and a practical format that is maximum incentive for players and parents to carry our flag.
Agreed that the 15s and 7s formats need to be separated and given due status.
Schools must be also be rewarded and supported by the national plan for their best players ...recognition and incentives for having players make the national squad is a massive boost to school, to players, their neighbors and the whole town ....most of all, it's our best talent available for national duty.
Thinking positive and focussing on Asia's top rank is our target.
It is a luxury that Japan has long guarded, and protected...now currently Hong Kong stepping up to the mark.
I am certainly looking forward to Sri islanders cutting our performance teeth and out classing all of this Asian domination ..ideally by 2019 and beyond.
Finally with so much in our league crystal ball, to contemplate....let's steer away from the blatantly obvious and ponder wildly about Havies being a force or CR shocking themselves and CH being a genuine threat to all of the top ..including the defending champions.
Christmas is the season for giving and sharing...traditional joy from seeing others happy?
Imagine the huge slice of happiness and Colombo wide celebration if Havies beat Kandy in Kandy? Or if CH grind a famous victory at the Nittawela cauldron of pain ..it's belief and singular effort of each player to perform out of their skins, be marauding warriors in the loose and rock solid in the sets.
Joyful noise if that were to happen next month. Let's keep an open mind and grin knowingly.
My wish for round 2 ..is more open running rugby and more tries to thrill us fans ...what a sight to behold. Imagine,...good lineout, 65m out, clean catch, zip pass from the 9, perfect hands from the fly half, decent depth and the centre on a loop ..full back overlap and a clinical finish for the winger to beat his opposite shadow ..leave him flat footed and a 25m flying try corner flag ....bula Sri rugby hearts, Merry Christmas to all ..see you for round 2.
Blessings islanders...enjoy the break and jolly!
