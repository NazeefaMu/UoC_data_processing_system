Australia in danger  of losing no.1 ranking

 
GALLE: Australia are in danger of losing their number one Test ranking if they suffer another defeat to Sri Lanka at Galle, venue of the second Test starting today.
Defeat would mean they concede the three-match series 0-2.
Prior to the start of the series the scenario was that Australia will have to win 2-0 or better against seventh-ranked Sri Lanka to ensure it does not go below its current 118 points. In contrast if Sri Lanka wins even by 1-0 they will earn seven points and move to 92 while Steve Smith’s side will slip to 111 points which means they drop below second placed India who are bound to improve their points as they are playing eighth-ranked West Indies.
Over the past three days or so the Aussies have been working their butts out trying to come to terms with the amount of spin subcontinent pitches offer.
“Generally in Australia spin bowlers just get the ball to not react too differently off the surface, you can hit through the line of the ball and there is a small margin for error whereas here you have a bigger margin for error especially in the subcontinent,” said Smith.
“It’s just the ball that reacts differently off the surface. It is very foreign and the guys have been working hard to try and get used to these conditions as much as possible. Having said that out in the middle with the extra pressures, guys around the bat and guys bowling well it could be difficult at times. You have to get better to handle them out in the middle.
“We’ve been doing a lot of work in the nets, spinners bowling getting the right speed, getting used to the breeze, there’s quite a lot of drift for the spin bowlers. The batters are trying to be very successful in these conditions we haven’t been able to do that so far. It’s been a while in subcontinent conditions that we have been able to be successful as a batting group. We are trying to turn that around,” he said.
Of the 15 batsmen who were ruled out lbw in the Pallekele Test, six were Australians.
“Looking at our dismissals in the last Test match the majority of us got beaten on the inside of the bat and coming straight on. So we are trying to get our pad out of the way and play with our bats. We have been working on that on different guards. It’s about implementing that in the game,” said Smith.
“We were a bit disappointed and flat initially now the moods brightened up a bit it’s about trying to turn it around. Australian sides come back from 0-1 down in the subcontinent. It’s all about rewriting history it would be great to do that on this tour.”
Australia will make only one change to their 11 that played at Pallekele with uncapped left-arm spinner Jon Holland replacing injured Steve O’Keefe. – ST
