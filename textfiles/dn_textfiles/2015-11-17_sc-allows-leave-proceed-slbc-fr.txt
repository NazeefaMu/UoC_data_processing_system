SC allows leave to proceed with SLBC FR

The Supreme Court yesterday granted leave to proceed with a Fundamental Rights petition filed by several trade unions attached to the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Cooperation (SLBC) challenging several appointments and promotions of employees made without calling for applications, contrary to the scheme of recruiting and promotion procedure.
The three-Judge-Bench comprising Justices Bewaneka Aluvihare, Sisira de Abrew and Anil Goonaratne fixed the matter for argument on April 1 next year.
The Sri Lanka Broadcasting Cooperation, the chairman of the SLBC and 62 other persons were cited as respondents. The petitioners alleged that the said promotions and salary increments have been granted to office bearers and numbers of Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya solely due to their political affiliations.
They sought an interim order to suspend the operation of the promotions in terms of the decision of directors of SLBC.
