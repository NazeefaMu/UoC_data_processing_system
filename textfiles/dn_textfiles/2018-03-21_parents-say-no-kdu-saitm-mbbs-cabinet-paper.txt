Parents say no to KDU (SAITM) MBBS Cabinet paper

The Parents Union of State Medical Students demands that President Maithripala Sirisena recall the Cabinet paper regarding the KDU (SAITM) MBBS immediately, the Union's spokesman Wasantha Alwis said.
Addressing a press conference held at the Organization of Professional Associations (OPA) in Colombo yesterday, he said that no one had agreed to offer SAITM students a KDU (SAITM) MBBS and all had agreed to offer them the KDU MBBS, which is recognized by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC). Therefore the President should do what the majority of SAITM students, their parents, the GMOA and many others demand, and not what was demanded by 101 unqualified students and their rich parents.
According to Alwis, the SLMC does not recognize SAITM or a new MBBS named KDU (SAITM). “State medical students will take to the streets again and fight until even few of them die if someone is trying to make 40 students with Ordinary Level qualifications and 28 students with three simple passes at the Advanced Level examination (3S), KDU (SAITM) MBBS doctors. Parents cannot stop their well-qualified state medical students coming to the streets again to fight against this injustice.”
