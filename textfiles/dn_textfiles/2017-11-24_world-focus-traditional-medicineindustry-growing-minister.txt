World focus on traditional medicine,industry growing - Minister

Sri Lanka which boasts of a 30,000 strong traditional medicine community will prepare to cater to a fast growing herbal medicine industry, expected to touch USD 110 billion in 2018, Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister, Dr.Rajitha Senaratne said.
The Minister addressing the three day International Symposium on Traditional and Complimentary Medicine (Tradmed) at Waters Edge, Battaramulla explained that the traditional medicine industry which had more practitioners than western medicine had over 40 percent of them academically and institutionally qualified. The symposium which had 120 research papers and 100 research posters provides a good platform for the exchange and development of research in the field.
“Traditional and indigenous practices are well accepted and compliment western medicine in this country. By integrating the two into our national health system we have further strengthened it”, Minister Senaratne said.
The Minister further stated that he appreciated the WHO stand to recognise alternative medicine as a viable source of cure for diseases, “They have realized that western medicine cannot answer all questions and there are blank areas which have been filled by alternative medicine”.
The symposium which was jointly organized by the Ministry, University of Sri Jayawardenapura and the WHO had WHO South East Asia Regional Director, Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh admit that traditional medicine had flourished well in Sri Lanka despite the presence of western medicine,
In Asia, 80 percent in rural areas use some form of traditional medicine, at times it is their only source of healthcare, she said, noting that many also used it to complement modern health practices, especially managing lifestyle related chronic conditions.
Dr Singh also commended the government for being the only country to combine both kinds of systems of medicine under one ministry. “Traditional medicine is a natural ally in our pursuit of universal coverage and the WHO supports the drive to fully integrate traditional medicine into healthcare systems”, she added.
Since 1997, the WHO has recognized the importance of traditional medicine and supported countries to develop their own traditional medicinal systems and use it in their health care systems, explained Dr Singh.
In 2014, the World Health Assembly adopted the Traditional Medicine Strategy to achieve two outcomes; fully harness traditional medicine benefits for people centred universal healthcare and to ensure traditional medicine is safe to use through regulation and research.
In October 2015, the WHO agreed on a five year action plan to; improve monitoring of traditional systems of medicine, increasing research in new developments in traditional medicine and encourage quality and safety by sharing best practices in national adverse reporting systems for traditional and modern medicine.
This also led to the development of indicators for monitoring traditional medicine systems,Dr Singh said.
