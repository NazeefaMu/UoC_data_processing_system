Ministry must complete initial process regarding elections: EC

The playground has to be made available by the owner and we don’t have the authority to proceed without the owner’s approval,Elections Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya said.
“It is the ministry that has to complete the initial process with regard to elections and hand it over to the commission.
Then the commission can take measures to conduct the elections. We expect the ministry to gazette both the Delimitation Committee Report and the notification announcing electoral wards as soon as possible,” Deshapriya said.
Speaking to the Media after a discussion with Provincial Council and Local Government Minister Faizer Mustapha, Deshapriya said the Delimitation Committee Chairman Asoka Peiris had agreed to discuss about the technical errors and added that there will not be any issues anymore between the ministry and him as reported by media in the recent past.
He further said that the technical errors pertaining to the Act also have to be amended and added that government, opposition and the cabinet together should do it for the betterment of the people.
“The election cannot be conducted only through gazette notification.The Minister and the Sectary to the Ministry of Local Government and Provincial Councils have the authority to correct the errors related to translation,highlighting and tally,” he added.
He noted that the Secretary to the Ministry informed him that the gazette notification announcing electoral wards will be issued before February 21.
Deshpriya further said that money has been allocated for the Provincial Council elections but not for the Local Government elections.
“We wrote to the Ministry of Finance about it and the secretary assured that money will be provided when the preparations are made to conduct the elections,”he added.
