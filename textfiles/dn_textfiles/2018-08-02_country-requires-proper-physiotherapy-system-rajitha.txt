Country requires proper physiotherapy system: Rajitha

The country requires a proper system for massage therapy and physiotherapy, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
He was addressing a gathering at an inauguration ceremony of a training course at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute (SLFI) for physiotherapists and massaging attendants, recently.
The minister said the public should be rescued from improper methods of therapy, adding that certain individuals often abuse the practice.
Massaging and physiotherapy had a direct impact on people’s health, Minister Dr. Seneratne said, adding that traditional massage techniques were still being used in certain countries such as China. The rise of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) is one of the main challenges faced by the country, he said; as such, regular exercises are a must to control them.
