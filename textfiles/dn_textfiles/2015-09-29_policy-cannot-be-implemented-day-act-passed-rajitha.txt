A policy cannot be implemented the day an Act is passed - Rajitha

Responding to a comment made by the national organiser of the Professor Senaka Bibile Commemoration Organisation Dr Jayantha Bandara on the National Drug Policy, Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne told the Daily News that the person who commented does not know anything about the implementation of a policy, governance, etc.
“There will not be an implementation on the following day of passing an Act,” he said.
Minister Senaratne said the Act should be first passed in Parliament and then the Authority should be created.
“We have already done both. Then we had to bring regulations to create the Authority, furnish the
place etc. The powers had to be given and the Cabinet decisions had to be taken. We did all those,” he said.
Minister Senaratne said after the general election, the second stage of the process has already commenced to gazette the regulations.
“Only after gazetting the regulations that we can take action against drugs. This is not an easy task. We need to recruit 100 pharmacists to carry out this operation. This will be similar to the Consumer Affairs Authority”.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that thousands of pharmacies scattered all over the country need to be inspected to find out whether they follow rules and regulations.
“This is a huge task. Qualified persons have already been appointed to the Authority. They are now moving forward,” he said.
“In the Act, temporarily, we allowed to use the trade name of the drug within brackets. We need to set up the quality assurance laboratory. The Chinese government granted the lab after my coordination. Those things also had been done in addition to the other tasks, but the persons who speak do not know anything,” the minister added.
