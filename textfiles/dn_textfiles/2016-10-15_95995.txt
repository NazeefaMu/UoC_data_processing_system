NZ rugby battered by scandal

In the Land of the Long White Cloud, heroes are clad in black. New Zealand are the world's rugby champions and the all-conquering All Blacks are idolised.
But these are dark times for New Zealand's national sport, that has become mired in scandal.
Reports on Wednesday say a member of the Mid Canterbury rugby team has been charged with assault with intent to commit rape in Gisborne, a North Island city, earlier this month.
It follows revelations that star scrum-half Aaron Smith was seen entering a toilet cubicle with a woman at Christchurch Airport. He was dropped from the squad that went on to thrash South Africa 57-15 in Durban.
Earlier this year, members of the Hamilton-based Super Rugby side the Chiefs were accused of sexually assaulting a woman paid to strip at a club function.
There was also anger recently when Losi Filipo, a highly rated teenager at the Wellington Lions, was discharged without conviction over charges of assaulting four people, including two women.
One of his victims was punched and repeatedly struck about the head, leaving him unable to work full-time because of migraines and chronic fatigue.
Then there was a bombshell in France, where the sports daily L'Equipe last week alleged that former All Blacks legend Dan Carter had failed a drug test after his club's victory over Toulon in June. The player's agent has, however, rejected any suggestion Carter was a drug cheat.
Kevin Norquay, a senior sports journalist at Fairfax Media in Wellington told the BBC the scandals and allegations have dented rugby's reputation. “They are all slightly different but they all add up to people wondering what is going on and having the ability on social media to actually voice their opinions and say ‘look, we really don't like this, we're not happy’,” he said.
‘Rugby is a national religion’
But such is the reverence for rugby players, there are Kiwi fans who will forgive them almost anything.
“In New Zealand, rugby is a national religion. These guys are put on a pedestal,” said Norquay. “Even when they do things that most members of society would regard as outside the realms of what is acceptable, there will still be a large group of rugby fans who can't see anything wrong in what All Blacks do.”
The BBC has asked New Zealand Rugby (NZR) how it maintains discipline and ensures that players remain role models, and what the organisation does when things go wrong. NZR has yet to fully respond to our inquiry.
So is the sport in crisis?
One of Auckland's most respected public relations consultants thinks not, but believes there are serious issues to be addressed.
“I think take the incidents together separately [and] it's not so much a crisis, but join them all together and certainly the spotlight is on them [NZR],” said Pippa Lekner, director of The PR Shop.
“We've definitely had a cluster, which has made it a bit of a tricky one for New Zealand Rugby.
The players “will be receiving a lot of advice”, she adds. “We often refer to them in the business as ‘heroes of the young'. People look up to them, so I imagine that they are being reminded of that on very regular occasions,” she added.
