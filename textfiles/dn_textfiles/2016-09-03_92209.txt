JO to boycott SLFP Convention

The Joint Opposition (JO) yesterday, decided not to participate in the Sri Lanka Freedom Party’s 65th Convention to be held in Kurunegala tomorrow.
According to Parliamentarian Dullas Alahapperuma, 59 Parliamentarians representing the Joint Opposition will not participate in this Convention. Parliamentarian Alahapperuma said the Joint Opposition made this decision to prevent the SLFP from becoming a branch of the United National Party when it celebrates its 66th anniversary in 2017. He said that they arrived at this decision after consulting the party members at grass-roots level in every constituency of the country.
Addressing a press conference at former President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s office in Battaramulla, Alahapperuma said Local Government representatives and Provincial Councillors representing the Joint Opposition will not participate in this Convention. “The Sri Lanka Freedom Party of today has become a cat’s paw of the United National Party. It follows the policies of the United National Party,”he said.
He said that SLFP electoral organisations around the country have decided not to participate in this Convention with an objective of directing the party on a proper path.
“We do not have any personal animosity with President Maithripala Sirisena nor any other SLFP Ministers in the government,”he said.
