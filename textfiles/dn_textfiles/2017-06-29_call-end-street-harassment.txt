Call to end street harassment

Parents in Nintavur, Ampara, urge authorities to take action against street harassment of girls who attend private classes and schools.
Girls are harassed everyday, while on the road by youths who make loud noises when they see girls passing, parents say.
Schoolgirls attending classes have decreased due to fear.
As harassment is a punishable offence, several complaints have been made by parents in this regard and action is yet to be taken.
