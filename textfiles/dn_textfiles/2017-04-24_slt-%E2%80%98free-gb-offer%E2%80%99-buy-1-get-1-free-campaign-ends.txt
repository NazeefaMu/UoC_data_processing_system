SLT ‘Free GB Offer’ buy 1 get 1 free campaign ends

As a means of catering to growing and encouraging extra GB usage, while rewarding customer loyalty, Sri Lanka Telecom launched the “Free GB Offer”, a buy one get one free campaign, which was held from March 13-19.
The campaign offered SLT Broadband customers the chance of getting an equal amount of free GB for each extra GB top-up they purchased.
As a pioneer of digital lifestyle in Sri Lanka, SLT is committed to the task of doing all in its power to enhance the broadband experience of their customers. Being the most agile and stable ISP in Sri Lanka, SLT Broadband is known to provide the highest volumes of data on a monthly basis.
The ‘On Demand’ data volume facility, also known as the ‘Extra GB’ facility, is one of the key features, which provides undisputed Internet experience quality to customers. This feature was introduced to enable additional GB top-up features online starting from 1GB.
Every time a customer purchased more volume his GB charges were reduced as a result, with prices ranging from Rs. 500 – Rs. 750 for 2 GB and 5GB respectively.
Ajantha Seneviratne, Group Chief Marketing Officer of SLT said, “As the leading broadband and backbone infrastructure service provider in the country, we have made it our topmost priority to deliver cutting-edge and smart solutions to our customers throughout our decades of operations. We will continue to bring forth more exciting offers to the customers, as we have done during the first few months of 2017”.
