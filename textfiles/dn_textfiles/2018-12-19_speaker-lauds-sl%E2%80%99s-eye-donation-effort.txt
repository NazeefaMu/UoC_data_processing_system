Speaker lauds SL’s eye donation effort

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said two people see the world because of the eye donations made by his late parents.
“I too have signed up with the eye donation campaign to donate my eyes after my death,” he said.
“Despite various shortcomings in our country, the level of interest shown by Sri Lankans to donate their eyes showcases us as a great nation to the world,” he said.
The Speaker was speaking as chief guest at the National Eye Donation Day celebrations organised by the Sri Lanka Eye Donation Society yesterday.
Apart from eyes, blood, kidney and donation of other body parts, the Speaker said he had also started a hair donation campaign for cancer patients, in the name of his late daughter who died of cancer, and given the response to that, he said he was able to experience first-hand the generous nature of fellow Sri Lankans.
“Though we are a small country, today I am speaking at the eye donation campaign which holds the largest eye donor bank in the world. That is a great honour which our country has won,” he said.
“Today, I am deeply honoured to be the son of parents who have donated their eyes. It was a dream of theirs to do so and today, we do not know who sees the world through them – their race, religion or caste is not known to us, except that it has benefited them,” the Speaker said.
“But we have the feeling that their eyes are still alive and one day I hope that someone else too will see the world again through my eyes.”
