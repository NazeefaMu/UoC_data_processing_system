Ties between Vietnam National State Assembly, SL Parliament to be strengthen

A special programme would be implemented to strengthen ties between the Vietnam National State Assembly and the Sri Lanka Parliament.
The decision was taken when Vietnam National State Assembly Chairman Nguyen Thi Kim Ngan met visiting Sri Lanka Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe for bilateral talks in Hanoi recently.
Ngan requested the Prime Minister to convey her greetings and good wishes to the Speaker of the Sri Lanka Parliament Karu Jayasuiriya, and Wickremesinghe explained the untiring efforts made by the Speaker to strengthen the Sri Lanka Parliament.
Close co-operation and sharing of experiences among legislators of the two countries would prove beneficial for both countries, the meeting emphasised.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said he would soon make arrangements for a Sri Lanka Parliamentary delegation co-ordinated by Ranjith Aluvihare, and the Oversight Committee Chairman on Parliamentary Affairs to undertake a study tour in Vietnam shortly.
Ngan said the Inter-parliamentary Union would be an ideal forum for close co-operation between the legislators of the two countries.
