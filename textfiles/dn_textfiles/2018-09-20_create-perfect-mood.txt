Create the  perfect mood

Breeze Spa at Amari Galle is all about creating the perfect mood, transporting you to a peaceful state of mind to help you relax from the rigours of everyday life.
The spa has developed a series of signature mood treatments to help take the guesswork out of picking just the right treatment. The Breeze Spa menu has been specially tailored to indulge your every mood with a selection of massages and scrub treatments to cater to the most avid spa lovers. The spa’s highly-trained therapists will not only assist you but also immerse and pamper you in a range of treatments and techniques that will completely relax both your mind and your body while ushering in a sense of calmness and happiness.
The spa menu features a selection of facial treatments and body wraps: from hydration, deep cleansing and sensitive needs to after-sunburn, brightening and anti-aging.
There is also a deep-tissue massage designed to release stress and tension from sitting for long hours at the desk, a treatment created for the gym enthusiast who has overdone their exercise regimen, or a more traditional approach using a combination of techniques from Thailand aimed at relieving every last bit of tension accumulatedthroughout the body.
The moment you step inside, Breeze Spa gives off a sense of calmness and tranquillity from the serene colours, as well as the minimal nature-inspired décor of the three individual treatment rooms, the two couple treatment suites, and the manicure and pedicure space.
The treatments at Breeze Spa focus on boosting energy and bringing back balance with a diverse range of therapies and relaxing treatments based on ‘mood analysis’, to refresh and create a sense of well-being.
Breeze Spa is a highlight of the expanding collection of Amari hotels, which enjoys a long-standing heritage with hotels and resorts in locations across Thailand, Malaysia, Laos, the Maldives, China, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.
