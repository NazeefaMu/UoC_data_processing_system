Minister Swaminathan's Cabinet Paper rejected

Resettlement, Rehabilitation, Northern Development and Hindu Religious Affairs, Minister D.M.Swaminathan who submitted for the third week in a row, a Cabinet Paper which proposed to pay reparations for families of dead LTTE cadres was rejected yesterday.
The Cabinet Paper it is learnt had been deferred over the last two weeks but this time, due to continued protests from ministers, was stopped for good.
The paper had also proposed to compensate those affected by the war, this included civilians, places of religious worship and the families of dead LTTE cadres.
The ministers had pointed out that they had no opposition to compensating civilian families and places of religious worship but they could not compensate dead LTTE cadres. Co-cabinet Spokesperson, Minister Rajitha Senaratne who spoke on the Cabinet Paper last week, said he too opposed it as it would otherwise be equal to condoning terrorism.
Sources also state that they could not amend the Cabinet Paper to only have civilian families included as it would then have to once again be submitted to a Sub-Committee and reviewed, not allowing the minister to re-submit the Cabinet Paper at consecutive Cabinet meetings.
However, at last week’s cabinet meeting, approval was granted to a proposal made by the Prime Minister to set up an Office for Reparations to provide reparations formally and transparently to individuals affected by conflict, political, civil disobedience or enforced disappearances.
