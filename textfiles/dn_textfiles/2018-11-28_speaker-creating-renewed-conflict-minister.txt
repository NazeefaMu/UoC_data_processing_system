Speaker creating  renewed conflict - Minister

The Speaker is going to great extremes to create a fresh conflict between Parliament and the Judiciary while the Government is demonstrating its complete respect for the Judiciary, following all court orders, Public Administration, Home Affairs and Justice Minister Susil Premajayantha said.
Addressing a press conference at the Prime Minister’s Office in Colombo yesterday he said that from November 14th onwards, the Speaker had been violating court orders, the constitution, the standing orders and traditions.
“He is acting without an Order Paper. Anything connected to court cases cannot be discussed in Parliament.
“Therefore, the Opposition cannot debate the validity of the Prime Minister, the Cabinet in Parliament after filing court cases.
Minister Premajayantha said nobody knows which Standing Orders were suspended on November 14th and 16th. “The President rejected the so called no confidence motion that was claimed to be passed in Parliament. If the first preamble in it is removed there is no existence of the second one because they are connected to each other,” he said.
The Minister said that according to the present Sri Lankan Constitution, the President can call a Presidential Election after January 9,2019 only if he wishes to contest. A new President will not be able to solve the issue of the current Parliament because no political party has the majority in it. A new President cannot dissolve Parliament until March 2020 if the arguments in the 19th Amendment is to be accepted.
If UPFA MPs cross over, the President can refrain from offering them Cabinet Ministerial positions and they can be removed from Parliament after holding a disciplinary inquiry. The people are sovereign and they have the right to select their representatives. “If my representative does not act according to my wishes, I can remover him or her and appoint another.There is no argument about that,” he added.
