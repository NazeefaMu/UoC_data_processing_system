Seafood exports increase after EU ban removal

 
Sri Lanka’s seafood exports have recorded a 40 percent growth during past six months due to the lifting of the ban on fish exports by the European Union.
According to the economic statics of the Central Bank the demand for Sri Lankan seafood exports in the global market has increased tremendously.
The country has earned Rs 12.9 million US Dollars through seafood exports in June 2016 and it has increased to 15.2 million US Dollars in June this year.
Earnings in the first six months of 2016 were 83.5 million US Dollars, while in the corresponding period this year it reached 117 million US Dollars.
The revenue received from fisheries exports this year in comparison to the first six months of last year was 40.3 per cent.
Commenting on this, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said that Sri Lanka has not yet been able to meet the demand for fisheries exports in the international market and the country has achieved only the one third of the demand.
The Minister further added that the government has already taken measures to enhance fisheries production with the intention of meeting the demand.
