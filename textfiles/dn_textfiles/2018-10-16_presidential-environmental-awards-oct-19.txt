Presidential Environmental Awards on Oct. 19

The Presidential Environmental Awards launched in 2015 in recognition of individuals, businesses and institutions which have rendered a great service towards the protection of the environment will be held on October 19, at the BMICH.
The event, under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena, would present awards under 19 categories from schools, government to businesses, the Central Environment Authority (CEA) said in a press release yesterday.
The Green Awards Programme launched by the CEA in 2011, was converted to the Presidential Environmental Awards Programme in 2015.
Nineteen areas including a number of industrial processes in Sri Lanka were selected for the Presidential Awards and the awards will be presented to those institutions which fulfill their objectives while complying with the provisions of the National Environment Act and at the same time, protecting the environment, said the CEA.
Applications for the 2018 Presidential Environmental Awards were called under two main categories, ‘Social, Cultural and Institutional Sectors’ and the ‘Business and Industrial Sector’.
Following field tests and other analyses on those sectors, final selections were made by an expert panel of judges and awardees were selected.
In the above evaluation process, the applicant institution’s environmental function, fulfillment of legal requirements, maintaining notes on environmental activities, environmental protection measures, previous awards received and so on were taken into consideration, the statement said.
Expressing his views on this event, CEA Chairman Chandraratne Pallegama said at a time when attention is being paid globally on the green production process associated with global sustainable development and a green lifestyle, the timely importance of the Presidential Environmental Awards was quite evident.
