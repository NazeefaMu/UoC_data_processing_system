No truth to rumours that North, East in danger: Defence Secretary

 
Defence Secretary Karunasena Hettiarachchi emphasized that there is no truth behind false allegation spread by extremists that the North and East is in danger.
“Anyone can visit these areas and clarify that the government has provided suitable livelihood environment for the people in these areas”, he added.
The Defence Secretary said that land acquired by the government during the war were being handed back to their legitimate owners - not because of international pressure, but because of the requirement to fulfill the needs of our brothers and sisters.
Defence Secretary Hettiarachchi made these remarks at the ‘Nila Mehewara’ Mobile Service Programme at the Richard Pathirana College in Galle on Saturday (3).
