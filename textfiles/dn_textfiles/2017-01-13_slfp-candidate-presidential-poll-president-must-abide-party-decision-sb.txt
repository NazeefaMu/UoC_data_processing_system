SLFP candidate for Presidential poll:  President must abide  by party decision: SB

 President Maithripala Sirisena cannot go against the party’s decision to be the Presidential hopeful of the SLFP led United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) at the next Presidential election, Social Welfare and Social Empowerment Minister S.B. Dissanayake said yesterday.
 He said that the party has already taken a decision to field incumbent President Maithripala Sirisena as the party’s candidate at the next Presidential election.
“He cannot go against the party’s decision,”Dissanayake stressed.
Dissanayake added that his party is of the view that the Executive Presidency should remain at a time when the country is striving to ensure that the periphery receives maximum power.
“The SLFP is of the view that the Executive Presidency should remain in to ensure the country’s territorial integrity and unitary status are protected,”he said. The minister was addressing the media after calling on Malwatte Mahanayake Thera Ven Thibottuwawe Sumangala Thera in Kandy yesterday.
Minister Dissanayake said that the Delimitation Committee report would be gazetted on or before next Monday and the Local Government (LG) election is expected to be held before April.
He said that former Local Government representatives and those who faced slight defeat at the last LG polls will receive preference at the nomination boards.
“Those who have been accused of corruption and various other malpractices would not be given nominations,”the minister said.
