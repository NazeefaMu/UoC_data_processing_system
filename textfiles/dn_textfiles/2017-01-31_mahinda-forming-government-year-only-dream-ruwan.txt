Mahinda forming a government this year, only a dream: Ruwan

The pledge made by the Joint Opposition group led by the former President to form a government this year will be a dream forever, said Defence State Minister Ruwan Wijewardane.

He was speaking to the media after attending a school equipment distribution ceremony at Bogaswewa, Vavuniya on January 28. Wijewardane said the two main political parties had joined hands to form a consensus government to resolve the problems of the people.
The Joint Opposition would be performing a great service towards the country and the people if it assisted in this noble endeavour without trying to disrupt this good intention, he said.
The best national service at this crucial moment in the country’s history would be for all parties and groups to join in the endeavour to resolve longstanding national problems and ensure better living conditions for the people. It was the greed for power which led certain parties and groups to disrupt the country’s forward march, Wijewardane said.
He said the government had launched several development programmes in the North and East. All efforts were being made to resolve problems through discussion with all parties and sections of the people.
Parliamentarian K. Masthan was also present.
