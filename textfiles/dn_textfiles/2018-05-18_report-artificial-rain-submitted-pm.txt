Report on artificial rain submitted to PM

A report submitted by a visiting Chinese delegation about the feasibility of creating artificial rain to help farmers cultivate their lands during off seasons was submitted to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on the sidelines of the signing ceremony of the agriculture sector modernisation project held at the Waters’ Edge, Battaramulla, on May 15.
This was a sequel to discussions that Social Welfare and Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage had with the Chinese government recently. The Chinese delegation led by Chinese Ambassador Cheng Xueyuan formulated the report after a study tour in Kandy, Nuwara Eliya, Kotmale and Ampara areas recently.
