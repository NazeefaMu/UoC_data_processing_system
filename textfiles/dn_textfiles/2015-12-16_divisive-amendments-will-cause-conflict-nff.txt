Divisive amendments will cause conflict - NFF

Kalutara National Freedom Front (NFF) MP Jayantha Samaraweera accused the amendments to the Penal Code and Criminal Procedure Code of being divisive, and said that his party would strongly oppose it. He said the amendments would cause conflict between ethno-religious groups, and added that 2016 Budget was a strange one.
Speaking to the media in Colombo yesterday, he urged people oppose the proposed amendments for the love of their country. He said that if the amendments went ahead, teachers would soon not be able to teach history lessons in school. The poems of Tibetan monks and Christmas carols would soon be banned because they would be deemed racial, he said.
He said that right now, a person could walk from Dondra Head to Point Pedro chanting Buddhist prayers and walk back from Point Pedro to Dondra Head chanting Hindu prayers, and not be disturbed: With the changes to the Penal Code and Criminal Procedure Code, there would no longer be the freedom to do this, he charged.
Speaking on the 2016 Budget, he said it would destroy the economy of Sri Lanka, and that the people's aspirations would not be realised.
