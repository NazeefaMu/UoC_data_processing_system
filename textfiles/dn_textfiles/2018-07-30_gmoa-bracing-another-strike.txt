GMOA bracing for another strike

The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) will strike on next Friday (August 3) if they do not receive a positive reaction from the President before Friday, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
He was addressing the media at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday evening.
He said the GMOA did not receive any response from the President for the letter they sent to him for the second time stating their 10 demands.
Dr. Aluthge said the copies of the letter were sent to all ministers and officials including the Prime Minister, Health Minister, Education Minister, Higher Education Minister, Finance Minister, Public Administration Minister, and International Trade Minister.
The GMOA will educate people on their demands from today (30) through awareness programmes and joint committee meetings, he said.
Not updating DAT allowance as promised, not issuing the gazette notification on the minimum standards of medical education, not responding to the proposals by doctors to ammend tax policy, violating the National Wages Policy are some of them reasons that are leading to the strike, he said. Signing Singapore FTA, delaying holding elections for the four vacancies in the SLMC and interrupting SLMC's functions, not solving grade promotions issues of doctors, not granting schools for doctors' children and intervening in appointments and transfers in the medical administrative service overlooking Public Service Commission and ignoring relevant rules and regulations are the other reasons, he said.
