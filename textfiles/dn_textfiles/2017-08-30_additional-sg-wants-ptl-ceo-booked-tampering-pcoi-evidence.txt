Additional SG wants PTL CEO booked for tampering with PCoI evidence

The Senior Additional Solicitor General Dappula de Livera yesterday (28) requested the Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating into the Treasury bond issue to consider taking legal action against Perpetual Treasuries Limited and its Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena for fabricating and tampering with evidence produced before the PCoI.
While charging that PTL has submitted fabricated materials regarding telephone call recordings during the period February 1,2015 to March 31, 2016, SASG de Livera revealed to the PCoI that the call logger system and its back up have been reinstalled by the PTL IT on July 6,2017. Stressing on the significance of the date this re installation was done SASG de Livera noted that the Central Bank issued a notice on the same day suspending PTL “from carrying on business and activities of a Primary Dealer for a period of six months with effect from 4.30 p.m. on 06 July 2017”. Speaking further, SASG de Livera informed that subsequent to an order made by the PCoI, Criminal Investigation Department yesterday (27) took over and sealed the voice logger computer of the PTL’s telephone call recording system after a back up copy of it was extracted.
