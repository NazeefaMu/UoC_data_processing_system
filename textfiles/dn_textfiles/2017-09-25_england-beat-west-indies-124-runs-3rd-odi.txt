England beat West Indies by 124 runs in 3rd ODI

Bristol: England beat West Indies by 124 runs to win the third one-day international at Bristol on Sunday.
West Indies, set 370 to win, finished on 245 all out after Moeen Ali's 53-ball century took England to 269 for nine in their 50 overs.
Joe Root (84) and Ben Stokes (73) laid the platform for a big total after West Indies captain Jason Holder won the toss. Veteran West Indies opener Chris Gayle marked his return to the side with a valiant 94 before he was run out by Adil Rashid's direct hit from midwicket after the Jamaica left-hander missed the rainswept no-result at Trent Bridge on Thursday with a hamstring injury.
From then on the Windies' chase fell away, with fast bowler Liam Plunkett taking five for 52 his maiden five-wicket ODI haul as England won with 65 balls to spare. AFP
