‘Fear psychosis reigned during previous regime, no more’

Fear psychosis reigned during the previous regime that prompted Geneva to impose certain restrictions on our country, is no more, Housing and Constructions Minister Sajith Premadasa said.
He was addressing the gathering at the foundation stone laying ceremony for the Ethrajagama Housing Scheme at Pahala Mattala in Hambantota.
The minister said that that fear was no more with yahapalanaya regime. “Now we are a country of rulers who have a soft corner in their hearts for the leaders of all countries. Now we have been given two years to correct our shortcomings,” he said.Minister Sajith said the opposition is spreading false rumours against the government and the country to mislead the people. He said such propaganda would fail after two years when the country achieve a tremendous success in all spheres including its economy.
“The stalwarts of the previous regime set up mega projects such as the Hambantota seaport and airport, but they were unable to shelter the less fortunate masses in the district,” the minister said.
