Producers of ‘American Made’ sue over fatal plane crash

Just a couple weeks before their new Tom Cruise film comes out in domestic theaters, the producers behind ‘American Made’ have filed a lawsuit in Georgia federal court over a plane crash during production that killed two individuals.
Cross Creek Pictures, Imagine Entertainment, Quadrant Pictures and Vendian Entertainment are suing S&S Aviation for what happened on Sept. 11, 2015, when, during the making of the film about the C.I.A.-recruited drug runner Barry Seal, a Piper/Smith Aerostar 600 plane crashed in Colombia. Alan Purwin, a helicopter stunt operator, was killed, as was Carlos Berl, an airman. Jimmy Lee Garland, a partner at S&S, was also in the plane and was left without feeling across much of his lower body.
The crash has developed into one huge legal situation, with the estates of Purwin and Garland suing each other and producers while an insurance company has filed its own claims in a separate lawsuit. All the parties are pinning blame or disclaiming responsibility for what happened. The fatal episode has raised serious questions about safety in Hollywood filmmaking. The Hollywood Reporter
