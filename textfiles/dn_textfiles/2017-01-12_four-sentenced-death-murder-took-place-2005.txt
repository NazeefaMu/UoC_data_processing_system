Four sentenced to death for  murder that took place in 2005

Four persons, residents of Helawatta in Gandara who were accused of the murder of Maddumage Dhanushka (35) in 2005, were sentenced to death by Matara High Court Judge Damith Thotawaththa.
A large number of relatives and family members had gathered near the High Court to hear the verdict and were seen lamenting once it was given.
Those sentenced to death were the 1st to 4th accused charged with causing the death of Damith Thotawaththa (a 35-year-old father of two at the time of death), by assaulting him and cutting him with swords.
