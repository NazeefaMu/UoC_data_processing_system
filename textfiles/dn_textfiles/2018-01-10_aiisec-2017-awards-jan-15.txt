AIISEC 2017 awards on Jan 15

The Lanka Japan Friendship Society in association with the Embassy of Japan in Sri Lanka, for the second year in succession, conducted the 'All Island Inter-school Essay Competition' (AIISEC) 2017 in all three languages - Sinhala, Tamil and English, for G.C.E. O/L and A/L students in schools throughout the Island.
The Topic was 'Japanese Success Story – Lessons for Sri Lanka'. The Lanka – Japan Friendship Society established in 1956 to promote mutual understanding, goodwill and friendship between Sri Lanka and Japan has initiated and implemented many programmes and projects and worked tirelessly for over six decades to achieve their declared objective.
The society has recognized the need to educate the younger generation, who will be the future leaders of this country, with regard to the cultural, social and economic bonds that existed between the two countries over the years and to strengthen and promote the firm friendship and mutual understanding, based on trust and goodwill between the people of two countries.
It will also provide an opportunity for Sri Lankan youth to learn more about the achievements by the Japanese people in science and technology, industry, trade, etc., which is vital for Sri Lanka at the present moment.
The winners of the competition will receive their awards at a ceremony to be held on Monday, January 15 at 10.00 am at the Sasakawa Cultural Centre Auditorium, Colombo 3.
Kenichi Suganumu, Ambassador for Japan in Sri Lanka, will grace the occasion as chief guest.
