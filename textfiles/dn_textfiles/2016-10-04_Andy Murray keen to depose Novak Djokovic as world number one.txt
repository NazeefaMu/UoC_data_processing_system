Andy Murray keen to depose Novak Djokovic as world number one

London Sunday: Britain’s Andy Murray says overtaking Novak Djokovic as the world’s top-ranked player is a big motivation for him for the rest of the 2016 season.
The Serb’s mixed form this year means Murray, 29, has a chance to claim top spot for the first time in his career.
On Wednesday, Djokovic pulled out of next week’s China Open in Beijing with an elbow injury.
“Trying to reach number one is a goal,” said Murray, who plays Italy’s world number 94 Andreas Seppi in round one.
“I’ve never been [top]. It’s something I would like to do for the first time, which is maybe more of a motivation for me than some of the guys that have been there before.
“But I want to just try and finish this year strong from a personal point of view. It’s been my best season to date, and I want to try to finish it as best as I can.”
