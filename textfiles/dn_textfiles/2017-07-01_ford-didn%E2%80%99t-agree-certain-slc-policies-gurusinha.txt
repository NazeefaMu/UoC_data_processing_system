Ford didn’t agree to certain SLC policies - Gurusinha

The sudden departure of South African-born Graham Ford from his position as head coach of the Sri Lanka cricket team took many by surprise especially after serving only 17 months of his 45-month contract with Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) which ran until the 2019 World Cup.
There were many unconfirmed reports that appeared in the media relating to Ford’s departure but no one actually came out with the real reasons behind his resignation, until now.
Asanka Gurusinha, a key member of Sri Lanka’s 1996 World Cup winning side and currently cricket manager of the national team was of the view that Ford was not too happy with certain policies laid down by Sri Lanka Cricket and that was the reason for his resignation.
“Fordy has been talking to me a little bit about certain things that were happening but I didn’t expect him to leave overnight like this. I thought if he was going to resign he would first sit with SLC and discuss things like grooming another coach or something like that. He didn’t mostly agree with SLC policies and it is very difficult if you are not prepared to fall in line, it becomes a bit of a problem. That’s the reason why he and SLC decided to part,” Gurusinha told the ‘Daily News’.
“What SLC is trying to do is to make everyone accountable. Including me all the coaches have to be accountable. Most probably that’s an area that affected him I don’t know whether he didn’t really enjoy that part because at the end of the day everyone is accountable. The main thing what I’ve heard was that he wasn’t agreeing with some of the policies of SLC.
“Fordy and I got on very well I didn’t have issues with him. He is a gentleman no doubt, a great guy. It is sad to lose him but at the same time it gives opportunity to others and us as well. Nic Pothas to me is a hands-on coach who understands our culture very well because he’s got a Greek background with similar culture. He is very direct with people and very hard working. When I look at both sides I feel okay, we lost a coach but then there are so many opportunities for SLC to go forward,” Gurusinha said.
“I was never into coaching I never got involved in coaching unless the coach asked me and I will not do it even now. I am qualified and I have all the qualifications in coaching but I believe it’s not my role right now. I don’t have experience in coaching a national team and I will not put my hand up and say ‘give it to me’ when there are more competent coaches to take over.”
Gurusinha, a left-hand number three batsman of repute compared his sudden departure from Sri Lanka shortly after winning the World Cup in 1996 to reasons similar to Ford. He was only 29 and reaching the peak of his career when he decided to take his family and move to Australia.
“l left Sri Lanka because I didn’t agree with some of the things that was happening, the decisions made by the national selectors and some of the board officials at the time. It is something that happened with Fordy. If you don’t agree you better move away,” explained Gurusinha.
“Do I have regrets? No. I spent 21 years in Australia it’s a long time. I was in sales and marketing for that 21 years which I was really enjoying. My children are big (they are age 28 and 24) that’s why I agreed to come back when Aravinda (de Silva) and Thilanga (Sumathipala) spoke to me.
“I’ve had offers before about five or six times but with the children and all those commitments I thought that was not the right time. I’ve always wanted to give something back to Sri Lanka cricket because where I am now as cricket manager and even in Australia for 21 years it was because of Sri Lanka cricket.
“When I came in I felt the team which was inexperienced needed someone like me to get them to the next level. If you had Mahela (Jayawardene) and Sanga (Kumar Sangakkara) you don’t need me because you have two greats who can run the team. I have never played with those two but what I’ve heard is that they were very strong leaders and they used to run training sessions and all of that. Their work ethic was superb and young guys followed them.”
Gurusinha said that SLC realized that there was a gap with regard to a lot of communication issues and his role is working and coordinating with the national team, the head coach and rest of the support staff, with the selectors as well as SLC.
“The role hasn’t changed at all from the first day. My role is high performance and identifying talent, what players to look at in the next 12-18 months with Simon Willis (the High Performance Manager) for the future and looking at the top 30 contracted players. We need to make sure we use them in a better way,” said Gurusinha.
“Player management is another area we have 8 Test matches and 18 ODIs till December. Player management is a major part which I am coordinating and working with the selectors (because I am a selector as well) and training staff especially the fast bowlers. If we keep playing them they will get injured with so much cricket being played.”
Gurusinha’s contract runs upto the 2019 Cricket World Cup and what he intends achieving by then is to help Sri Lanka win another World Cup.
“The goal is pretty much to win the World Cup but then there is so much work to be done. After every tour I am looking at our performances going up. We have broken it down to different levels after every tour so we know by the end of this year where we need to be and what we need to get there,” said Gurusinha.
“We got to win as well because if you don’t you lose confidence and also overall the sponsorships keep going down because nobody wants to support a losing side. Rankings also these days are very important. You need to keep performing consistently but at the same time on another level keep developing players whom we can get into the team at any time.
“What Sanath (Jayasuriya) and I are working with the rest of the selectors is to have a 20-member group we have identified for Test and ODIs and try to work with that 20 for the next 12 to 18 months. We have a program of shadow cricketers as well so we know if someone is injured whom we can bring in.
“We don’t want to bring any players just picking them for scoring a hundred we want them to be in the system first to realise our fitness schedules. Some guys when you bring them into the squad they struggle with the intensity of our training. We want them to understand our fitness and fielding levels not just only their skills. What I am trying to do is get the same intensity with the ‘A’ team and Under 19 squads so that when we bring in a player he is ready to go which is not happening right now.”
Describing the talent available in the country as “phenomenal” Gurusinha said: “Sri Lanka is a country that will never grow short of talent but the important thing is talent alone is not enough. If you are playing international cricket fitness plays a major part and one percent you need to push the players. When you are training that’s what Nic (Pothas) and I try to get into the team. When the going is tough, push yourself a little bit and get up and do it. That is how you win matches consistently. You need that energy from somewhere to come out and do it. That is what we are working on.”
