What Colombo looks like right now

Stormy weather has caused chaos in Colombo as vehicles stall and people run for cover from the rain and strong winds.
The Meteorological Department warned that fairly strong winds of upto 40-50 kmph could be expected over the island.
Showers or thundershowers will occur in the Western, Sabaragamuwa, Southern, Central and North-western province, it said, with fairly heavy falls (more than 50 mm) expected at some places.
