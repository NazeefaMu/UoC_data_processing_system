Emergency law to lift after President returns

The lifting of emergency law in the country has been delayed until the return of President Maithripala Sirisena, currently on an official visit to Japan, President’s Secretary Austin Fernando told the Daily News.
The gazette notification pertaining to the lifting of emergency law was to be issued yesterday (14).
However, as the President is overseas the relevant gazette is expected to be released on March 18 after the President returns from Japan on March 17.
Currently the country is peaceful and no incidents of violence have been reported during the past few days. The emergency had to be imposed on March 6 due to the racially motivated clashes that erupted in Kandy and Ampara recently.
The emergency law will be in force until the return of the President and the relevant gazette notification pertaining to its removal is issued.
Law and Order Minister Ranjith Maddumabandara said discussions are underway with regard to the lifting of emergency law. “We are in the process of discussing with the security forces and police as well to see if they need time for their investigations. So under this situation, we may have to extend the emergency law by a few more days,” he said.
He said while the country has returned to normal, emergency was being extended to facilitate the investigations that are being carried out.
