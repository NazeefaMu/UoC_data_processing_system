School ceiling collapses killing student

A 13-year-old boy who climbed a roof of a school building to catch pigeons died of injuries he sustained when the ceiling of the building gave way and crashed with him on September 22 afternoon.
Udappuwa police said the boy succumbed to his injuries at the Chilaw Hospital on September 23 morning where he had been admitted the previous day. He was identified as Kalidasan Sivakaran of Nanaturai, Udappuwa, a grade 7 student of the Udappuwa Tamil Maha Vidyalaya. Investigations revealed that as other friends watched, Sivakaran had crept into the ceiling where the pigeons had built a nest to catch them when the ceiling collapsed with him.
Udappuwa police are investigating.
