Softlogic to raise Rs. 7 bn with foreign equity investments up to USD 35 mn

Softlogic Holdings PLC came to an agreement with Samena Ceylon Holdings Limited to raise private equity in order to restructure Company balance sheet and improve key capital ratios.
Samena Ceylon Holdings is a fully owned subsidiary of Samena Capital, a principal investment group focusing on the Subcontinent, Asia, Middle East and North Africa.
The firm has raised more than USD 1.5 billion of capital since 2008 and has returned USD 615 million to investors from over 45 full and partial exits. Samena Capital currently manages total capital of approximately USD 1 billion across three primary investment strategies: private equity, direct investments, and credit.
This will be Samena Capital’s first investment in Sri Lanka and its fourth investment in the Asian region within the past six months.
The private placement of 182.7 milion ordinary shares at Rs. 17 per share raises Rs. 3.11 billion for Softlogic Holdings PLC to be utilized to settle short-term debt. Subsequently, Samena Capital will hold 19% of the Company.
A further issue of 230.81Mn shares by way of rights issue in the proportion of 24:100 at Rs. 17.00 per share will be made to raise Rs. 3.9 billion.
Softlogic Holdings PLC’s present stated capital stands at Rs. 5,089 million with 779 million shares in issue. Subsequent to the private placement and rights issue, the stated capital would rise to Rs. 12,119 million with 1,192.5 million shares.
Softlogic Holdings PLC has been investing in strategic CAPEX projects with a long term view.
This fund-raising exercise which raises over Rs. 7 billion will help the Company rectify the funding mismatch and, in turn, boost profitability with noticeable saving in finance costs when equity replacesdebt.
Ashok Pathirage – Chairman/ Managing Director of Softlogic Group, said, “Samena brings in a wealth of global business expertise and access to quality financing. With this equity infusion, Softlogic’s financial position will be strengthened, propelling strong bottom line and supporting medium term investments.”
Shirish Saraf, Founder & Vice Chairman of Samena Capital, said, “We are delighted about our first investment in Sri Lanka and to partner with Ashok Pathirage in Softlogic Holdings. We strongly believe Sri Lanka is one of the most exciting markets in the Samena region and our investment reflects our confidence in the Softlogic Group.
We see multiple growth drivers for each of the businesses and look forward to actively supporting the Softlogic team in their endeavour of building a truly world class enterprise.”
This fund-raising exercise is subject to regulatory approvals and shareholder approval at a General Meeting.
