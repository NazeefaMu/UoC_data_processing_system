SLFP to contest alone at LG polls

SLFP General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake yesterday, said the SLFP will not contest the upcoming Local Government polls in alliance with the UNP.
Speaking to the media after an SLFP group meeting convened by President Maithripala Sirisena at the Presidential Secretariat, the minister said the SLFP will contest under a broad alliance.
“We will campaign hard in all LG bodies and win as many as possible,” he said adding that the preparations for the elections were discussed at length at the meeting.
The SLFP members representing the Joint Opposition group did not attend the meeting yesterday though they had been informed in writing. The JO group had sent a letter to the SLFP imposing conditions to contest the LG polls together.
