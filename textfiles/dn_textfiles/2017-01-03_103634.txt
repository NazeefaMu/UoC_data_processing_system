Batticaloa DS saves the day

Batticaloa District Secretary P. S. M. Charles’ timely action helped save two foreign female students who were on the verge of being sexually harassed in the Batticaloa bound mail train from Colombo, by a gang of six. The Batticaloa District Secretary who was on the train witnessed six people attempting to sexually harass the two foreign students by threatening them with daggers.
She had alerted the Police while the other commuters had left the compartment.
However, the train had stopped on the way and the Police arrested the six suspects.
This was revealed by Charles at a ceremony held to commence work at the Batticaloa District Secretariat for the New Year yesterday.
