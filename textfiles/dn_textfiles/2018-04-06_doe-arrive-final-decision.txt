Ordinary Level student malpractices:
DOE to arrive at final decision

The Department of Examinations (DOE) had decided to expedite investigations in order to arrive at a final decision regarding the 969 candidates who were recently found to have committed frauds during last year's G. C. E. (O. L.) Examination. Their results are currently being withheld by the department, Examinations Commissioner General B. Sanath Pujitha told the Daily News yesterday.
School candidates who wish to have their results re-scrutinised, have to submit the relevant applications by tomorrow through their respective schools heads, while private candidates have to submit their applications on or before April 12, the commissioner general added.
The relevant details and application form specimens in this regard, were published in national newspapers on March 30.
Closing dates for this purpose would not be extended under any circumstances, he said.
