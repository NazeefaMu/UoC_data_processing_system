Sri Lanka Insurance declares highest Life Bonus  in industry

Sri Lanka Insurance has declared a Life Bonus of Rs 6.2 billion for this year, recording the largest Life Bonus ever to be declared in the insurance industry. The company achieved this historic milestone by surpassing its own record of Rs 5.4 billion declared as Life Bonus in the year 2016.
SLI also recorded the largest Life Fund in the local insurance industry to date with a ground-breaking Rs. 91.1 billion in its Life Fund.
Over the past years, Sri Lanka Insurance has been declaring increasing bonuses to its Life policyholders. It has given over Rs 40 billion in total as Life Insurance bonuses since 2006. Sri Lanka Insurance’s prudent investment management strategies and accumulating Life Fund have enabled the company to give higher returns to its policyholders. The company shares 90 per cent of the surplus earned from its Life Fund with its Life policyholders.
SLI, the pioneer as well as the leading National Insurance Company, recorded an outstanding performance during 2016 while recording a significant growth in its Assets Base to Rs. 177 billion, which is again the largest in the insurance industry.
