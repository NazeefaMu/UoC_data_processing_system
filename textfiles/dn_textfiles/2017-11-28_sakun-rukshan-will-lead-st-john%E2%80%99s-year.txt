Sakun Rukshan will lead St John’s this year

Third year player all-rounder Dasanayake Mudiyanselage Sakun Rukshan Dissanayake is captaining the first eleven cricket team of St. Johns College Panadura in the ongoing under 19 cricket season. His deputy will be Ashan Dilhara and the Coach and Master in charge are Naminda Dissanayake and Upul Gunatilleke respectively.
Johnians who have a proud record in cricket for more than twelve decades are playing in the under 19 division one cricket tournament for the first time and last year they beat St. Thomas College Matara to qualify for the division one. Sakun will be the first ever Johnian to lead his alma mater in division one.
This right hand batsman and off spinner has to face a big task because this year they have only three senior players and the rest are freshers.
But according to Sakun their principal M. Harshana Peiris and all other officials are extending their support
This season they have eight matches on the card and already they have played with St. Aloysius College Galle which ended in a no decision due to rain. They will be playing Royal College Panadura in their Big Match and they are down to take on them in a Limited over game too.
