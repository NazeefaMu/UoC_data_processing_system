Reminiscing Toy Story

Every scene is an opportunity for a gag, and every plot development an excuse for more gags. This basically sums up Chris Renaud and Yarrow Cheney’s latest contribution to animation films ‘The Secret Life of Pets’. The film is made merely for entertainment and nothing more. Thus it lacks ambition. There are a series of episodes taking place but no depth in the tale.Another in a long line of family-centric animated escapades, the computer-generated project is reminiscent of Pixar’s pioneering ‘Toy Story’ franchise. The only difference is that there are pets in the place of toys!As with the toys, the pets too constantly vie for their owners’ affection. But what do they get up to when the master isn’t around? Left to their own devices, the critters run rampant through the streets, alleyways and sewers of New York City.
Domesticated pets
The film kicks on with the arrival of Duke, a rather inconsiderate newfoundland, into the house of Max, a Jack Russell Terrier, who starts to feel insecure and bullied. Shortly, Max and Duke get lost, and worse, land in the clutches of Animal Control. They are shortly rescued by a white rabbit named Snowball who has issues with humans. However Snowball and clan soon turns against Max and Duke because they would not fit in as “there’s domestication all over them”. Meanwhile Gidget, a white pomeranian is so smitten with Max that she heads a pack of domesticated pets to his rescue.
The jokes and gags are the stereotyped type which go with cats and dogs. Some of the jokes don’t even make you laugh out loud. For instance the scene in which Max and Duke are scared away by cats was trying too hard to make the episode look funny. In another episode Max and Duke make sad dog faces to cajole a man to part with his hotdog. Likewise a cat does not shy away from steppting on a man’s private parts when he scampers across a room. In one instance a dog is so overcome with its owner’s homecoming that it urinates in excitement. If you are a dog or cat owner, you will be all too familiar with these tactics. So they would hardly make you smile let alone laugh.
Artful skyline
Although the 3D effects aren’t top-notch, the replication of the bustling New York skyline is artful. The animation and design teams have also taken commendable care to capture the quirkiness of an entire cast of animal characters.
One of the best features of the movie is Snowball. One would hardly expect a rabbit to be evil but Snowball makes an effective villain.
Kevin Hart who renders his voice to Snowball too does his bit well and his voice fills the evil bunny’s persona admirably.
‘The Secret Life of Pets’ won’t stick to you the way the great movies do, but is a genuinely enjoyable sit. The background details are pleasing on the eyes even if the tale bores you. If you are a dog or cat person you might enjoy this movie. Or else it like its four legged canines and feline, this movie too tries too hard to please!
