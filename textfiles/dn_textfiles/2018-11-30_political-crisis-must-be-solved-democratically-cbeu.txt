Political crisis must be solved democratically - CBEU

The country can never be steered on the correct path until the political crisis which has destabilised the country is solved through a democratic framework, the Ceylon Bank Employees’ Union (CBEU) said in a statement.
For that to happen the security of the Executive, Legislature, Judiciary and people’s sovereignty should be protected. Without doing this, the rulers seem to behave like actors in a tragicomedy, the statement said.
The statement signed by CBEU General Secretary Ranjan Senanayake said there were several issues which adversely affected the country’s economy regarding which no political party had stated its stand. They were the privatisation of state assets including state banks, the draconian tax policy, white paper to destroy EPF, the adverse Singapore FTA and the employment programme.
No government party had so far pledged to do away with these programmes. As such, the Ceylon Bank Employees’ Union which had no truck with any political party planned to launch an unrelenting campaign against these programmes.
As part of this programme, the CBEU has launched a series of seminars at provincial level themed Rata Koibatada in an effort to drive the local economy in the correct direction.
