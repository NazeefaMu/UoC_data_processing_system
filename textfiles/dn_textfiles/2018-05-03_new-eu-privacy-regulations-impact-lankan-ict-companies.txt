New EU privacy regulations to impact Lankan ICT companies

Sri Lankan ICT companies providing services to Europe will have to comply with new privacy regulation that would be implemented from May 24 by the European Union. (EU)
The EU Regulation on Data Protection (GDPR) would be implemented form May and this would also have an impact on Sri Lanka.
Addressing a seminar organised by Deloittee, Partner, Risk Advisory, Cyber Risk, Manish Sehgal said that this regulation was introduced by EU mainly to protect privacy of people which should be protected.
He said that today forwarding advertisements, promotions, and packages either to mobile or emails is considered a breach of privacy of an individual. Sehgal said that Sri Lanka companies that entertain bookings from European clients will not have to follow the new GDPR regulation from May 24.
He also highlighted that whenever person searchers the web or sends an email to book or inquire on a hotel package to a certain destination or try purchase an air ticket this record is being uses by other competitors and the user keeps on receiving offers. “This too is considered a breach of privacy.” He said that state of California in US implements strict privacy laws and this model would be copied by Europe as well.
