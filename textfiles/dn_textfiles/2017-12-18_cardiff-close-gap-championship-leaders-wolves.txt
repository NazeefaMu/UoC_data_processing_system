Bristol City remain third, eight points behind Wolves, after beating Nottingham Forest 2-1 at Ashton Gate thanks to first-half goals from Marlon Pack and Joe Bryan. Kieran Dowell pulled a goal back for Forest but they were unable to equalise.
Andreas Weimann scored against his old club as fourth-placed Derby County defeated fifth-placed Aston Villa 2-0 at Pride Park. Johnny Russell secured the win in second-half injury time.
