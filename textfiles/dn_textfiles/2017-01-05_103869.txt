Rural libraries in deplorable state

Rural libraries which were initiated by the government under the Local Government authorities are in a deplorable state causing immense difficulties to readers.
They said the majority of these libraries are not functioning properly due to the lack of supervision.
Librarians are not there on time and these libraries are being neglected but the management is not aware of this situation.
Over 30 such rural libraries have been established by the government in the district. But, no improvement is visible, the readers said. The daily newspapers are also not available in some libraries. Therefore, those using the libraries urge the government to rectify this as soon as possible for the benefit of the people.
