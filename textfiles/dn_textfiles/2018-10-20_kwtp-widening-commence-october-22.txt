Lasting solution for drinking water issue in Kalutara:
KWTP widening to commence on October 22

The daily water issue of the people in the Kalutara district will be resolved when the Kethhena Water Treatment Plant (KWTP) widening project is complete.
State and Indian banks will fund the project and it will commence on October 22.
Residents in the Kalutara district, specially those living at Mathugama, Walallawita, Kalutara, Madurawala, Agalawatte, Waskaduwa, Panadura and Beruwala drink water contaminated with sea water for years in dry seasons.
The Water Supply and Drainage Board (Head office) (WSDB) with the co-operation of the Kalutara district Parliamentarian and the District Co-ordinating Committee Co-Chairman Lakshman Ananda Wijemanna and Kalutara GA UDC Jayalal held a press conference at the GA's office auditorium last Tuesday (16).

The WSDB will find accelerated solutions for the severe drinking water problem in the Kalutara, Beruwala, Matugama, Dodangoda, Agalawatte and Madurawala divisional secretariat divisions through “Aluthgama–Matugama–Agalawatte Integrated Water Supply Project funded by the Indian Excim Bank (24,285m), Bank of Ceylon (Rs 4,286m) and the Central Government (Rs. 3,707m) totalling up to Rs 32,278 million.
Chief Engineer N. K. D. Jayasumana said there will not be any drinking water problem for anybody in Kalutara once this integrated Water Supply Project by the NWSDB commences.
He said that step by step, water pipes will be laid covering the whole district.
Water storage tanks will be constructed at Beruwala, Dharga Town, Dodangoda and Matugama under this project and three water towers will be constructed at Agalawatte, Neboda and Matugama to ease and accelerate water supply.
