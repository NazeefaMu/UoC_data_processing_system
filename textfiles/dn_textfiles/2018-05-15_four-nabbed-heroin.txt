Four nabbed with heroin

Four suspects, who were engaged in the illicit narcotic drugs business in Peramiyankulama and Sravastipura areas for a long period avoiding a police dragnet, were arrested with more than five grammes of heroin in their possession.
The arrest was made by the Anuradhapura District Police flying squad, recently.
Among them are a person named Andrew alias ‘Kele Kotiya’ and an accomplice of the underworld kingpin ‘SF Lokka’ who is in remand custody over an alleged bomb case.
The raid was carried out by a team led by Inspector Prabath Gallage and Comprising Sergeant Edirisuriya and constables Bandara, Samarakoon, Keerawelle, Nishan, Dissanayake, Rajakaruna, Wijebandara and woman police sergeant Nilanthi under the instructions of DIG (NCP) Pratap Sandungahawatta.
