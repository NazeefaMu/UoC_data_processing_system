Point of view
Equities opened 2018 on a strongly positive note, maintaining last week’s uptrend (+46 points) to gain ~145 points W-o-W and pushing the Index past the key 6500-mark for the 1st time in 2-months.
Bullish sentiment by both foreigners and local HNI & Institutional investors helped buoy markets, and the benchmark ASPI’s 145 point gain in the 1st week of trading contrasts sharply to the 75 point loss recorded in the 1st week of trading in 2017 and the 168 point loss recorded in the 1st week of trading in 2016.
Foreign investors remained net buyers in local equities to the tune of Rs.2.0Bn this week, mirroring the general trend of continued risk appetite at the start of 2018 for EM equities which hit 6-year highs as new economic data showed the global economy expanding at a healthy pace.
Local HNI and Institutional investors meanwhile, returned to markets strongly this week, accounting for 60% of market turnover amid crossings in blue chips HNB (55% of total crossings), JKH (17% of crossings), Melstacorp (8%) and Sampath (8%).
Renewed interest in fundamentally strong counters helped drive the Index’s 145 point gain this week, with index heavyweights JKH and CTC accounting for 35 & 24.8 points respectively, of the index’s 145 point gain; Banking & Finance stocks (COMB,SAMP,LOLC & HNB) meanwhile, accounted for 25.7 index points while Telco’s DIAL and SLT accounted for 14.8 points.
The Index’s positive performance translates to a 2.3% gain in the 1st trading week of 2018, a notable contrast to the loss of 1.1% in Q4’17. Sri Lankan equities returned 2.3% in 2017 for the 1st time in 3 years (2016 =-9.7% and 2015=-5.5%) as strong gains in Q2’17 (11.3%) helped offset losses of 2.7% in Q1’17, -4.6% in Q3’17 and -1.1% in Q4’17. The positive return of 2.3% on the ASPI in 2017 however, contrasts sharply with peers in EM & FM markets, which recorded multi-year highs of 34% (MSCI EM) and 24%(MSCI FM) in 2017. Current market momentum is likely to continue in the week ahead.
CBSL forecasts lower GDP growth in 2017
At the annual presentation of its Roadmap for the year, the CBSL noted that growth in 2017 is likely to be lower than originally estimated (<4% cf. 4.5% originally) but that GDP should recover to 5-5.5% in 2018 amid ongoing legal amendments, the continuation of fiscal consolidation and stronger reforms to attract investment and boost exports1.
The Monetary Authority noted that 2017 was a challenging year due the economy-wide effects of inclement weather, noting that while the drought and floods disturbed agriculture/agro-based industrial activities, the spillover effects of these adverse weather conditions impacted the other sectors of the economy too.
The CBSL also noted that low economic growth was partly due to the tighter Monetary and Fiscal policy (aimed at restoring macroeconomic stability) which impacted public and private investment spending.
Weather-related supply disruptions, revisions to indirect taxes and increased prices of imported commodities meanwhile, impacted inflation levels making the CBSL’s efforts to anchor inflation expectations challenging.
The CBSL noted though that despite these challenges, macro-economic stability is being restored and the economy is trending in the correct direction due in large part to the significant progress in several policy measures taken by the CBSL in coordination with the GoSL.
The CBSL added that while it had implemented several proactive policy measures in 2017 to achieve the core objectives of maintaining economic and price stability and financial system stability, the GoSL has also remained committed to a revenue based fiscal consolidation programme that aims reduce budget deficits and debt levels progressively.
