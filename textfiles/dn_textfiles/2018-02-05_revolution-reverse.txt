Revolution in reverse

On the evening of November 21, 2013, Mustafa Nayyem, a Ukrainian reporter, posted a thirty-one-word comment on his Facebook page that led to the toppling of the Ukrainian government. Nayyem was angry about President Viktor Yanukovych’s failure to sign an association agreement with the European Union. He goaded his Facebook friends to protest on Kyiv’s main square, the Maidan. He did not want the demonstration to be virtual. “Likes”, he typed, “don’t count.”
And so began one of history’s first smartphone uprisings, powered by photos captured on thousands of tiny cameras and hurtled around the globe onto millions of miniature screens. In The Ukrainian Night, Marci Shore describes the events as a “revolution”. Her history entails an extraordinary declaration of the power of human will and self-determination.
Maidan became a historical event when Ukrainian special forces, the Berkut, fired on the small group of protesters who responded to Nayyem’s plea. The gunshots immediately ricocheted across social media. Hundreds of thousands of outraged citizens headed for the square. Shore describes how the Maidan occupiers made an impromptu alternative society, setting up tents, soup kitchens and a stage. They organized an Open University and a library, held concerts, and rolled in an upright piano painted yellow and blue.
Civilisational choice
Food, clothing and medicine were distributed free of charge. The homeless were welcome. No one got drunk. “The Maidan was so clean you could eat off the asphalt”, a protester named Misha Martynenko told Shore. Theirs was “a civilisational choice”, Shore writes, “to be free of Russia, to be part of Europe, where Ukraine had been three or four centuries ago”.
Shore claims that she is not interested in politics but in the lived experience of these events. She uses mini-biographies of several dozen Ukrainians, most of them pro-Maidan intellectuals, to recount the first days of the uprising, its metamorphosis into a “revolution” and devolution into civil war. The biographies give a lucid, human dimension to the conflict. To justify her approach, she quotes the philosopher Stanislaw Brzozowski: “What is not biography – is nothing at all”.
That is one of a number of either/or statements that crowd into this history. Shore’s pro-Maidan Ukrainians look towards youth, the future, Europe and democratic civilization over a nostalgia for a socialist, authoritarian East. They choose plurality and tolerance over their opposites.
After a month’s experiment in anarchic self-organization, the Berkut attacked Maidan’s village. A battle followed of David and Goliath proportions. The rebels fought with paving bricks, Molotov cocktails and conventional weapons. They also deployed their cell-phones, live-streaming death. Yanukovych and Vladimir Putin “won the propaganda war in the official media”, Shore writes, “but they lost in the social media” because of “a transparency that was unimaginable” in earlier revolutions.
How quickly things have changed. That observation now appears obsolete in the wake of revelations that Russian trolls used Facebook and Twitter to subvert the American and British elections. By choosing to tell individual stories, Shore relies on oral testimony, yet as parties fought to control the image of Maidan, fake news abounded. Shore’s account would have been more valuable had she sourced her subject’s accounts to sort fact from fiction.
Tent museum
The military phase of the revolution gave pre-eminence to strongmen: their courage, strength, pyrotechnic power and PR skills. As many mostly young and male protesters died, they were reimagined as hallowed martyrs. A tent museum quickly materialized on the Maidan, exhibiting the bike helmets and garbage-can shields that protesters used against the Berkut’s deadly bullets, also on display. Dozens of memorials to the fallen “heavenly hundred” peppered the city.
They were framed with candles and embroidered rushnyki in the way saints are depicted in Ukrainian Orthodox churches. Ukrainians of all political stripes could embrace this message of defence of the homeland. It was a narrative of national martyrdom that had deep roots in the Soviet memorialization of the “Great Patriotic War” against fascism – an official commemoration uncomplicated by histories of collaboration, mass rape, mass incarceration and genocide.
The battle over the Maidan and the ensuing conflict in the Donbas cleansed the taint of wartime collaboration from right-wing protesters who held aloft portraits of leaders of the one-time Nazi ally, the Ukrainian Resistance Army. After Maidan, these leaders became the forefathers of the “heavenly hundreds”. In commemorating Maidan and the Donbas, the yellow-and-blue Ukrainian trident was finally free to fly. And fly it did.
A Harvard University mapping project shows the spread of Ukrainian nationalist images that until 2014 had been considered unacceptably right-wing in many parts of the country. Maidan was a godsend for this militant brand of nationalism. There is a long tradition of commentators using Eastern Europe to elaborate the polarities of East and West in order to define slippery abstractions such as “freedom” and “democracy”. Deploying Ukraine as a canvas for political allegory can be a useful exercise, but perhaps the model of “freedom revolution” is off target. For some Ukrainians, “Europe” and “freedom” meant simply good roads and warm radiators. For others, they meant the ability to speak one’s mind.
Fifth column
Following the successful ousting of Yanukovych and the election of the pro-European President Petro Poroshenko, neither promise has materialized. On his blog, Nayyem, whose tweet started Maidan, complains that citizens who criticize the government are smeared as a Russian “fifth column”. Poroshenko’s administration, he opines, only listens to bankers and media magnates.
From the perspective of early 2018, Maidan appears as a very modern, digitally nimble event that shares some features with the Occupy movement but for which we don’t yet have a proper term. Maidan was a city square and also a social-media space. To occupy the Maidan meant to take charge of the messages that flowed from it. The contest involved discrediting one’s adversaries’ headlines and projecting one’s own. People tended to follow their own news stream. Optimization logarithms, matching likes to likes, helped that trend along, as did trolls generating fake news. For a price, Facebook, Twitter and their Slavic equivalent VKontake directed news updates and political advertising (the two often indistinguishable) to people most likely to believe them. As crowd-sourcing grouped opinion into warring camps, it became difficult to determine the lines of reality, or to agree on a common future. The state, weakened by leaders whose main goal in power appears to have been to elevate corporate profits by emasculating the judiciary and bankrupting federal coffers, encouraged social divisions.
Government, left in shambles with a combative and paralysed legislature, had to rely on a powerful executive and local warlords. Lost in this confusing blitz, many citizens turned to nationalism as an ideology that provided, if not answers, then at least villains to blame for the morass.
What if we stop thinking of Eastern Europe as a template where events play out at a delayed pace following Western liberal models? What if Maidan is not a snapshot of the past, but a portent of the future, or a wild reflection of the present? If so, then this version of Maidan looks frightfully familiar as I write from Washington, DC. What is the name for a freedom revolution in reverse?
