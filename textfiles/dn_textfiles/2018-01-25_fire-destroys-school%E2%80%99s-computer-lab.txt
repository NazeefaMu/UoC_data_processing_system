Fire destroys school’s computer lab

A fire which erupted in a two-storeyed building at the Karandeniya, Anuruddhagama Kanishta Vidyalaya, Elpitiya, had completely destroyed its computer lab including 20 computers and documents. Kapila Kumara (45), a parent, said the school did not have a watcher or a security wall around it.
Education authorities in the area should at least build a wall around the school for its security and provide some computers to enable students to continue computer training, he said. Elpitiya Police is investigating.
