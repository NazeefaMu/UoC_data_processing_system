EU praises Lanka’s commitment to int’l obligations

Sri Lanka’s renewed commitment to respecting international rule of law and upholding its human, labour rights and environmental obligations has resulted in the European Commission recommending the reinstatement of GSP Plus,European Union ambassador in Sri Lanka Tung Lai Margue said.
In a message to mark Europe Day 2017,the Ambassador said Sri Lanka and European Union reset relationship after the election of a government with a commitment and vision to make fundamental reforms.
“We renewed our cooperation, broadening our political dialogue to cover a wide rang of topics from fisheries, exports to trade from agriculture to climate change as well as often difficult and sensitive topics such as national reconciliation,”he said.
Excerpts of the message:
“The formation and development of the European Union offers important lessons in pursuing goals of peace, stability, and prosperity. South Asia remains the least integrated region in the world despite Sri Lanka’s tireless championing of the cause, which gives an indication of the potential that could be harnessed by better and increased cooperation.
“But within the country, the Sri Lankan Government is in the enviable position of being mandated to chart a definitive course for national reconciliation that recognises an inclusive and collective Sri Lankan identity.
“Two years ago, after the election of a government with a commitment and vision to make fundamental reforms, Sri Lanka and the European Union reset our relationship: we renewed our cooperation, broadening our political dialogue to cover a wide range of topics, from fisheries exports to trade, from agriculture to climate change, as well as often difficult and sensitive topics such as national reconciliation, good governance, human rights and the rule of law. “Sri Lanka’s renewed commitment to respecting international rule of law and upholding its international human rights, labour rights and environmental obligations has resulted in the European Commission recommending the reinstatement of GSP Plus. “Getting there took many hours of intense collaboration between Sri Lanka and the EU, as together we examined Sri Lanka’s compliance with the 27 international conventions on which the GSP+ assessment is based.
“I hope that our colleagues in the Member States and in the European Parliament will soon indicate that they are happy for readmission to take place.
Our wider cooperation is increasing. We are working with Government to build on our important cooperation in rural development across the country by contributing to work on national reconciliation, including providing funding to support the resettlement of people displaced by the war and supporting language training for public officials to help bring forward the day when all Sri Lankans are able to communicate with public officials in their own language.
“Throughout the civil war and in its aftermath, we have worked with community leaders, civil society, and human rights activists to press for the protection of fundamental freedoms and values.
“We continue to do so. These efforts are important and they will deepen. But they can only support reform and change in people’s lives where the political will to make those changes exists. Achieving real change requires vision, standing up to spoilers and vested interests, and clearly communicating to all people the importance and benefits of reform.
These are lessons that we have learnt from the development of the European Union. Sometimes they have been learnt
the hard way. But they offer important insights into how the Government can shape the SriLanka of tomorrow”.
