‘Female participation low in decision-making roles’

The unsung heroes of the Sri Lanka Army, the Women’s Corps (SLAWC), which has rendered an immense service to the nation with little recognition, will take the lead in creating a forum for women to discuss women’s contributions to the country under the theme ‘Women: the Bedrock of Peace and Sustainable Development’, scheduled to take place at the BMICH on December 4.
This was revealed at a media briefing held at the Colombo Hilton Residences on Tuesday.
With the majority of the country’s population consisting of women, it is inevitable that women will take the lead in all forms of development in future. This symposium will also serve as a platform for learning and interacting as women’s participation in leading decision-making roles since they are also still underrepresented in society. The first ever symposium of this nature organised by the SLAWC will be held under various appropriate topics.
Addressing the media, Dr. Dayani Panagoda said that since the forming of the Women’s Corps in 1979, till 2009 it had served as a support service during the war.
“What we expect to achieve through this conference is to create a broader engagement with various segments of society in terms of women’s participation. Although women are engaged in many areas, when it comes to decision-making roles, female participation is at a low level. This forum would serve to encourage women to forge ahead in their chosen fields and take on a greater role in society.”
Professor Jeewa Niriella said women’s participation in Sri Lanka is on par with the rest of the world, but when it comes to taking on leadership, Sri Lanka is at a lower level.
“In roles of administration, female participation gradually decreases, and we need to see why this happens. This sort of forum will give women the opportunity to see why they are less engaged in decision-making roles and take appropriate measures to increase it,” she said.
She added that a woman receives ample experience while playing many roles within her family, which is helpful to her in handling any position in society.
Director General Training Major General Aruna Wanniarachchi, Sri Lanka Army Women’s Corps Regiment Colonel Major General Manoj Mudannayake, Colombo University Public and International Law Department Head Prof. Jeewa Niriella, Independent Consultant/Attorney-at-Law/Partner Associated Law Chambers Dr. Dayani Panagoda, SLAWC Additional Regimental Centre General Staff Officer 1 Major Nayomi Rathnayake, and SLAWC Legal Officer Colonel Buddhika Ferdinandez attended the media briefing.
