Railway trade unions temporarily call off strike

 
Railway trade unions temporarily called off their strike after meeting with President Maithripala Sirisena's Secretary Austin Fernando today (12).
The railway unions launched their strike yesterday (11)  alleging that a group of junior train drivers, who were still under training, were being employed breaching the normal recruitment procedures.
Thousands of commuters were stranded due to the strike, which was launched without prior notice.
