Seminar on Water, quality, pollution, treatment and testing and workshop will be held on April 5 and 6 at Institute of Chemistry, Rajagiriya.
The event that would be addressed by professionals in the field will enable participants to gain the required knowledge and hands on experiences and guidance for efficient water testing and management.Water is an essential component of the living world. In many industries it is used as a medium for mixing ingredients, as a reactant or as a solvent to discharge soluble waste.
According to world Health Organization Report 2007, nearly 1.4 billion people worldwide are under the threat of not having access to good quality drinking water.
Proper handling of water in an industry or a laboratory is very important. The environmental problems with waste water can affect the industries critically.
Although, water is considered as a renewable resource, it may not be possible to have water with expected quality for the demand. Therefore, the proper water management strategies will be important to use the water efficiently. Quality assuring of drinking and industrially used water is of extreme importance.
