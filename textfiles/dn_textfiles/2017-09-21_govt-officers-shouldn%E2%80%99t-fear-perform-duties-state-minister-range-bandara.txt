Govt officers shouldn’t fear to perform duties: State Minister Range Bandara

Government officers should not fear to perform their duties, according to rules and regulations, Irrigation and Water Management State Minister Palitha Ranga Bandara said.
He said so while opening development work in the Vanathavillu Pookulam Village recently. The State Minister said former Presidential Secretary Lalith Weerathunga was imprisoned and the incident was turned in to a political matter, he said.
“Many efforts are being taken to horrify government officers. This is due to the imprisonment of Lalith Weerathunga has put the Opposition party in surprise,” State Minister Bandara said.
“The imprisonment of Lalith Weerathunga is not a big issue. If the then President had ordered something, Lalith should have formed a structure to perform his duty. Though he was considered as a good government officer, he didn’t perform his duties correctly.
“He only knows whether he expected political advantage through Sil clothes distribution,” the State Minister said.
“If he wanted to distribute Sil clothe, is it correct to get Rs. 600 million from the Telecommunication Regulatory Commission? This proves that he has engaged in the act of bribery,” he said.
“The officers shouldn’t fear to perform their duties. More than 99 percent officers are genuine in their works. Only a few officers are engaged in bribery and corruption. The country and the government have maintained self respect. The government’s first consideration is to build up that respect. That is what our country needs,” he said.
“If we don’t have a good picture, there will be no progress for us towards a better future. There’s no need to fear to serve the nation.
“There will be no problem, if the duties of the politicians are performed within the policy framework of the country,” the State Minister said.
