Stay cool, calm, and under control

‘Don’t Let Sensitive Skin Hold You Back!’ promises The Body Shop, the leading British beauty brand known globally for its commitment to expert-endorsed beauty and skin care.
The socially and environmentally conscious name has just released its newest weapon in the fight against skin sensitivity: the Mediterranean Almond Milk with Oats Facial Mask.
As the name suggests, this new healing mask harnesses the most effective properties of these power ingredients, to not just tame, but rejuvenate dry and irritable skin. A 100% vegan product, the Mediterranean Almond Milk with Oats Facial Mask stays true to the brand’s commitment to ethical practices in sourcing the anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory ingredients that make up the product. Made with Community Trade organic almond milk from Spain and oatmeal from the UK, this mask not just instantly relieves the discomfort associated with skin sensitivity, but also gently buffs away dead skin cells to restore the affected skin’s barrier. For the ultimate complexion that is smooth and hydrated, sensitive skin types can choose to mask either once a week, or even twice weekly if preferred.
For sensitive skin
Although the face is more prone to symptoms of sensitive skin, the rest of your body needs to be cared for as well. The Body Shop’s Almond Milk and Honey range for sensitive skin for instance, includes gentle pH- balanced cleansers and intensely hydrating moisturisers that are hypoallergenic and formulated without colourants. This range of skin products -as with the Mediterranean Almond Milk with Oats Face Mask- harnesses the anti-inflammatory and moisturizing properties of almonds which were discovered centuries ago in the treatment of skin conditions and minor wounds. Honey is also an age-old beauty ingredient known for its anti- microbial and as well as hydrating properties.
Another product that works wonders on sensitive skin is The Body Shop’s luxuriously soothing and moisturizing Aloe and Camomile ranges are enriched with Community Trade organic aloe vera and camomile– both ingredients renowned for their cooling and healing properties. As part of your daily skincare regime, opt for the Aloe Calming Cream Cleanser or Aloe Calming Foaming Wash and the Aloe Soothing Night Cream. The Camomile Sumptuous Cleansing Butter or Camomile Silky Cleansing Oil are additional must-haves for the beauty drawers of sensitive skin types.
Look glamorous
Caring for sensitive skin doesn’t necessarily have to be restricted to the use of skincare products however, for The Body Shop’s range of make-up ensures that sensitive skin types don’t feel left out when it’s time to glam up. The Fresh Nude Foundation and Colour Crush Lipstick -available in a range of tones and colours- are gentle on the skin and lips, all the while having you look as glamorous as you feel.
The new Mediterranean Almond Milk with Oats Facial Mask soothing mask is an extension of The Body Shop’s Recipe of Nature Super Food Masks series, following the release of the British Rose Fresh Plumping Mask, the Ethiopian Honey Deep Nourishing Mask, the Chinese Ginseng and Rice Clarifying Polishing Mask, the Amazonian Acai Energizing Radiance Mask, the Japanese Matcha Mask, and the very popular Himalayan Charcoal Purifying Mask – each with their own exclusive ingredients and properties.
The Mediterranean Almond Milk with Oats Face Mask alongside other sensitive skin care products can be found at The Body Shop flagship store on Bagatale Road, and outlets at Odel Alexandria Place, the Kandy City Centre and soon at the Colombo City Centre. -NA
