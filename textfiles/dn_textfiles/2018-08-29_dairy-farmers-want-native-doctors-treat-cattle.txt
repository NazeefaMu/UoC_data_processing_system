Dairy farmers want native doctors to treat cattle

Dairy farmers in Kataragama, Tissamaharama, Lunugamvehera and Thanamalwila urge the government to appoint native doctors at village level to treat their cattle.
Several dairy farmers said that they have to undergo untold hardships when their cattle contract diseases.
"A veterinarian's office is around 25 kilometers away.We have to hire a vehicle to take the animal.Medicine prescribed by vets is very expensive and we have buy them from pharmacies," farmers said.
In case of native doctors they visit the sick animal and prescribe medication prepared from barks, roots and leaves in the jungle and are comparatively cheaper than medicine prescribed by the veterinarians.
Most dairy farmers can afford this native treatment.If the government takes action to appoint native doctors for villages, dairy farmers will benefit, they said.
