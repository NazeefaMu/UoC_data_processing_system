FR filed against COPE report re-fixed for support

A Fundamental Rights petition filed by Ven. Thiniyawala Palitha Thera challenging the various findings and statements made in a report prepared by the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) regarding the bond issues by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in the year of 2015 and 2016 was yesterday, re-fixed for support on January 26 next year by the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court three-judge-bench comprised Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, Justice Anil Goonaratne and Justice Vijith Malalgoda.
The petitioner Vice Secretary of the Sri Lanka Mahabodhi Society Ven. Thiniyawala Palitha Thera had cited 26 members of COPE including its chairman Sunil Hadunnetti who have been tasked by Parliament of Sri Lanka to investigate and report on matters pertaining to certain Treasury bond auctions, the Monetary Board of the Central Bank, the Governor of the CBSL, Chairman of the Tender Committee of the CBSL and Superintendent of the Public Debt Department of the CBSL, the Auditor General of Sri Lanka and the Attorney General as respondents in the petition.
The petitioner stated that consequent to being elected in September 2015, Parliament appointed the members of COPE to conduct an investigation into certain Central Bank auctions of Treasury Bonds which occurred in February 2015 and March 2016.
The members of COPE have submitted their final report to Parliament on or about October 28, 2016.
The said COPE report maintains that; the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 9th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th 18th, 21st, 22nd, 24th and 26th Respondents agreed to the said COPE report in general without the footnotes. The 6th,7th, 8th, 10th, 11th, 13th, 20th, 23rd and 25th Respondents agreed to the said COPE report with the footnotes.
All members of the Committee (the 1st to 26th Respondents) unanimously agreed to the recommendations given at the end of the report.
The Petitioner expressly pleads that notwithstanding that the said COPE report was presented to Parliament on or about October 28, 2016, the same remained inaccessible to the general public and the Petitioner for some time. The Petitioner pleads that the said COPE report only became accessible to the Petitioner on or about November 24, 2016.
In the circumstances aforesaid, the Petitioner pleads that the Petitioner could not file this application sooner as the COPE report was inaccessible to him, and he was not aware of the contents of the same, until November 24, 2016. The Petitioner further stated that in any event the continuous reliance or circulation or actions of the said COPE report as it presently stands amounts to a continuing infringement of the Petitioner’s fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution of Sri Lanka, and also amounts to a cause which enables the Petitioner to prefer this application in the public interest.
The Petitioner pleads that through the said COPE report, the Petitioner and the general public have been misinformed and misled.
The Petitioner said that in the event that the CBSL was not properly or officially or lawfully issuing Treasury Bonds viz the direct and private placement from the month of January 2009, the proper procedure that ought to have been followed from January 2009 was the Central Bank Treasury bond auction process.
The Petitioner further stated that instead of reporting the above to Parliament and the general public, the said COPE report is littered with inconsistencies or contradictions or misrepresentations, which the Petitioner pleads makes certain findings and statements in the COPE report unsafe, or prejudiced or biased, and a violation and infringement of the Petitioner’s fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution of Sri Lanka.
The Petitioner and the general public of Sri Lanka are entitled to receive a fair, impartial and truthful investigation into such matters, which is free from bias and ulterior/political objectives. The Petitioner states that by the glaring contradictions or inconsistencies or misrepresentations contained in the said COPE report, the members of the COPE committee (the 1st to 26th Respondents) have not fulfilled their duties and obligations to the Petitioner and other members of the general public of Sri Lanka.
The petitioner is seeking an Order or Declare that any express or implied finding and statement and suggestion in the said COPE report that the direct and private placement method in the issue of Treasury Bonds by the Central Bank has been properly, lawfully and correctly used by the Central Bank from the month of January 2009 up until the date of the COPE report, is wrongful.
The petitioner is further seeking an Order or Declare that as at the time of the Treasury Bond auctions of the Central Bank that was held on February 27, 2015 and March 29, 2016, the proper, lawful process or method as regards the issue of Treasury Bonds was the auction process/method, and not the direct/private placement process/method.
