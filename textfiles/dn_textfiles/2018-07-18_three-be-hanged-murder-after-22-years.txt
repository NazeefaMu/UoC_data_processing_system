Three to be hanged for murder after 22 years

The Colombo High Court yesterday sentenced three men to death after they were found guilty of killing their neighbour over a personal dispute in 1996.
High Court Judge Vikum Kaluarachchi made this order following a lengthy hearing into the incident and observed that the prosecution had proved the three accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt. Three accused Pradeep Premachandra, Sudath Kumara and Sumith Lal were ordered to be taken to the Welikada Prison and hanged to death within the four walls of the prison on a day and time appointed by the President.
Each of them was ordered to pay a fine of Rs.75,000. One accused was sentenced to seven and a half year rigorous imprisonment, while another one was ordered to be released and acquitted from the case after perusing evidence.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against five individuals, residents of Pannipitiya for committing the murder on November 2, 1996. The accused had been further charged for inflicting injuries to the deceased’s wife with a sharp weapon. The verdict was given nearly 22 years after the murder.
