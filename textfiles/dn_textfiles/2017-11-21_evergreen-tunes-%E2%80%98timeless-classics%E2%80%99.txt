Evergreen tunes in ‘Timeless Classics’

‘Timeless Classics', featuring the much loved Soundarie David and Shey Liyanage, is a concert to raise funds toward two of the Rotary Club of Colombo East’s anchor projects namely, Project BEAP—Accident and Emergency Trauma Unit Centre at the Teaching Hospital in Batticaloa, and the eradication of dengue which has claimed many lives in the island over the last few years. The Rotary Club of Colombo East partners with Shangri-La Hotel, Colombo for this worthy cause.
“The Trauma Centre of the Emergency and Accident Services at the Batticaloa Hospital is to be upgraded and modelled after the Karapitiya Emergency Hospital, a previous project of the Rotary Club of Colombo East. This initiative is a long overdue need in Batticaloa as the Eastern Province has approximately seven lives being lost each day and many more persons injured.” says Indrajith Fernando, President of the Rotary Colombo East.
He adds, “We are also engaged in multiple dengue eradication projects across the island which include funding research in the hope of bringing about medical-science breakthroughs in this field”.
The Rotary Club Colombo East appreciates the support extended by the Government for both these projects.
The Eastern province, in addition to its high population, also boasts of the best surfing facilities in the world, drawing thousands of tourists each year from across the globe and the rest of the island too. Ensuring better healthcare for both the local community and tourists in Batticaloa was at the heart of the Club’s efforts with both Rotary Colombo East, and the Rotary Club Strathmore in Melbourne joining hands.
A sum of two million (USD) has been donated to the project by local and foreign donors thus far, and with the “Timeless Classics” concert the Rotary Club are confident of driving further funding for this national minded project that is surely the need of the hour. Timeless Classics will feature an amazing line up of talent including Soundarie David, Shehara (Shey) Liyanage and more. Timeless Classics will take place at the Shangri-La Ballroom on November 26, and as the largest ballroom in the city, this is the ideal venue for an event of this nature.
Timothy Wright, Vice President and General Manager of Shangri-La Hotel, Colombo said, “Embracing such initiatives allows Shangri-La Hotel, Colombo to endorse both research toward long term solutions for pressing national issues, whilst also contributing toward immediate solutions. This is our commitment to the communities in which we operate”.
