Amending law regarding 25 pc quota for women problematic: Secretary

Amending the law to revise the 25 percent quota for female representation at this point is problematic, Local Government and Provincial Councils Ministry Secretary Kamal Pathmasiri said.
Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, he pointed out that any amendments to the Local Authorities Elections Act would only apply to future elections and not the recently concluded Local Government elections.
He made this observation in response to Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya, who on Wednesday proposed to amend the law to allow councils to be established even without the mandatory 25 percent quota under special circumstances. “The quota of 25 percent for female representation at the Local Government bodies is already the law of the country.
“The Election Commission conducted the elections subject to that provision. How can we bring in Amendments with retrospective effect at this stage?” he questioned.
He added that the Election Commission has so far not informed the Ministry over such a request. “The Election Commission must contact the Attorney General and get their legal opinion to resolve the prevailing matters,” he noted.
The Election Commission Chairman observed that the Local Government bodies, which do not complete their 25 percent quota for women, cannot establish a council as per the newly introduced law. He proposed revising the law to avoid any injustice to political parties which cannot appoint the set number of female candidates due to having an overhang and cannot choose female candidates from the additional list to make up numbers.
