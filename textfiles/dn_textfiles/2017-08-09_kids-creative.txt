Kids creative

Camp Kreativ (CK) an initiative by Power of Play (PoP), is a summer holiday program with a difference. Back for the fourth year in succession, the popular series of workshops will take place at the Sooriya Music Village, 49, Skelton Road, Colombo 5 from August 14 to 19. CK 2017 features workshops in drama, dance, robotics, musical theatre and more open for ages 4-6 years and 7-12 years.
CK 2017 also features the return of its excellent Photography workshops which are open to 10-19 year olds. All workshops have been formulated to ensure that they cater to the needs and interests of each of these unique age groups.
“PoP is a company specializing in the use of performing arts for education” explains Founder and Artistic Director of Power of Play Sulochana Dissanayake “Camp Kreativ is one of our flagship projects and we attribute its’ success to its unique offering which combines an intensive, immersive, enriching holiday program covering multiple creative disciplines, with a chance for participants to be exposed to a world of alternative careers that thrive outside the box of traditional employment”.
For the 4 to 6 age group, counselor Seema Omar and dramatherapist Tehani Chitty return to CK this year to take kids through ‘Discovery through play’ a module that uses drama games, storytelling, art and movement to develop participants’ creativity and imagination. Imesha from the Chitrasena School of Dance will handle the dance workshops for this group, while Sulochana herself will step in for sessions on drama and puppetry.
The 7 to 12 age group sees the return of Sri Lankan Australian musical comedy performer Larry T Hill who handles the musical theatre workshops, and Hasith from Igniterspace with his fascinating robotics and coding activities. Sulochana and Imesha will run drama and dance sessions respectively for this age group, while brand new this year is a session entitled ‘Girls, Boy and our bodies’ by Subha Wijesiriwardena which focuses on gender and self awareness as well as building self esteem and self confidence. Registrations for the camp are open with a few places still available. For details visit www.powerofplay.lk or call 0777274483.
