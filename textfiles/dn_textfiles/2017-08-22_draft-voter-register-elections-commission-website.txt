Draft voter register on Elections Commission website

The draft 2017 Voters Register formulated by the Elections Commission is now exhibited in the commission website www.elections.gov.lk, the Department of Government Information said in press release. Apart from this the 2016 voters register, names deleted and newly added to it can be inspected at the respective Grama Niladhari offices.
The release said that since a laxity had been observed in the addition of names to the Votes Register in the Colombo city, Colombo district and many sub urban areas people are requested to make certain that their names have been included in the 2017 voters list because only people whose names are included in the 2017 voters register will be entitled to exercise their vote at future elections. The Commission has requested all citizens above 18 years of age to inform the respective election officers immediately, if by chance their names have not been included in the 2017 Voters’ Register.
