Mahindra, Ideal Motors to bring digital innovation in SL

Mahindra recently launched TRRINGO, an organized tractor rental service and SmartShift, the digital marketplace for intra-city logistics.
Sri Lanka, as a nation is on the brink of digitisation with several initiatives by the government to migrate towards a Digital economy.
Sri Lanka is a step ahead of other South Asian nations with digital penetration, infrastructure and connectivity.
This gives Mahindra an opportunity to partner in this journey of Digital Sri Lanka, with innovation led services for consumers.

DiGiSENSE will empower customers to digitally build knowledge 24X7 about the performance and location of their vehicles. Drivers can contact emergency breakdown services or pull up a route planner at the touch of a button.
In a country where farm mechanization penetration is low, Mahindra would like to play a significant role in enabling its farmers to improve their productivity and Rise by providing accessible technology.
The TRRINGO farm equipment rental business model will enable farmers to deploy mechanization technology on a pay per use basis without investing in the asset.
This will increase their output and prosperity and lead to the inclusive growth of the country.
SmartShift is a technology enabled load exchange platform. The Mahindra Group is all set to ride the digital wave by exploring new horizons and rapidly adopting technology towards developing new ecosystems.
SmartShift will act as an exchange platform for cargo owners and transporters, enabling them to work mutually with each other.
