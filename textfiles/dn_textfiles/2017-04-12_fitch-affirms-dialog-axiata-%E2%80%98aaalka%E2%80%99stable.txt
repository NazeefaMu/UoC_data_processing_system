Fitch affirms Dialog Axiata at ‘AAA(lka)’/stable

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Sri Lanka-based telecom company Dialog Axiata PLC’s National Long-Term Rating at ‘AAA(lka)’. The outlook is stable.
Fitch says that Dialog’s standalone credit profile of ‘AAA(lka)’ is underpinned by its market leadership in the expanding mobile and pay-TV segments.
We believe Dialog is in a position to gain revenue market share from smaller telcos in light of its superior 3G/4G network capability. Its financial profile is solid, with moderate 2017 forecast FFO-adjusted net leverage of 1.2x-1.4x and stable operating EBITDAR margin of 34%-35% (2016: 35%).
“We believe Dialog could potentially receive support from its 83% Malaysian parent, Axiata Group Berhad (Axiata), if its standalone credit profile were to weaken.
Dialog and its parent have moderate linkages, which include sharing key management personnel, a common brand name and common creditors”.
This could lead to reputational risk to Axiata should Dialog fail.
Fitch says that they expect Dialog’s revenue growth to slow to around 5%-6% in 2017 (2016: 17%), as consumers are likely to curb their voice and data usage due to higher taxes.
