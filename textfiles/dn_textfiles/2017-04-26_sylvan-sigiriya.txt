Sylvan Sigiriya

Sigiriya Jungles revolutionized the luxury resort segment when it opened its doors for business. A breath of fresh air in terms of architecture and ethos, the deluxe Sri Lankan-styled resort offered a unique value proposition to guests who were seeking a resort with a difference. The resort offers a change from the cookie cutter design of modern resorts by infusing a rustic yet luxurious feel. More importantly, the resort preserves the sanctity of the environs in which it is located - namely, the UNESCO recognized Sigiriya Rock.
Architect Vinod Jayasinghe of Vinod Jayasinghe Associates (Pvt) Ltd., says, “The client gave us a free hand and empowered us to conceptualize a completely new theme for Sigiriya Jungles that would be in keeping with its physical setting. Our first priority was to preserve existing the surrounding greenery and verdant nature and build around it in a way that the resort is unobtrusive and blends in subtly yet effectively.”
He explains that the design of the resort drew from Sri Lankan elements and imbued it with local motifs and symbols, with inclusion of aspects of temple architecture. “Since it is located in the heart of the cultural triangle, it offers an exclusive Sri Lankan experience where the rustic and the royal combine for an unforgettable encounter,” adds Jayasinghe.
The legendary Sri Lankan warmth and hospitality can be genuinely evidenced at this resort, where guests are made to feel like it is a home away from home. Spread over 10 acres of naturally landscaped greenery, Sigiriya Jungles is located near the Audangawa Village, about 5 kms from the Sigiriya Rock Fortress.
An exclusive design feature of the property includes a large iconic wooden bridge which provides extraordinary vistas of the Sigiriya Rock and the Pidurangala Monastery, as also of the verdant environs. Jayasinghe says, “The sky bridge is an extension of bringing the outside directly to guests. The response to it has been overwhelming and a famous writer who visited recently could not stop gushing about the property.”
The sustainability features of the operation such as sewage treatment plants, solar energy and water recycling plants and other such aspects uphold the property’s eco-friendly status.
Sigiriya Jungles offers 60 lavishly furnished rooms overlooking the Sigiriya Rock Fortress. Each room is designed to serve as a sanctuary with tranquil indoor and outdoor living spaces, intimate artistic touches and luxury service. The rooms offer all imaginable creature comforts for guests.
The resort’s objective to offer an authentic Sri Lankan experience extends to its cuisine, which consists of traditional Sri Lankan rice and curry ensembles. The resort also offers delectable cuisine befitting its upmarket status. Its eclectic restaurants serve a fusion of Western and Eastern cuisine and traditional Sri Lankan fare.
The resort showcases the island’s traditions, music & art at every turn, thereby immersing its guests in a truly definitive experience. A choice of indoor and outdoor restaurants offering signature cuisine, an expansive bar, a large living lounge and a shopping area offers hours of pleasure.
Sigiriya Jungles is the ideal destination for both business and pleasure. It has exclusive conference and banquet halls to cater for upto 150 people along with state-of-the-art conference facilities.
The strategically located resort offers guests the facility to embark on exciting cultural, religious or adventure excursions, which is facilitated by the hotel staff.
