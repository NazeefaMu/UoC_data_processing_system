Did Royal cheat to end Hayman trophy drought?

Royal College won the first leg of the coveted RL Hayman trophy narrowly beating S. Thomas’ College for the first time in seven years.
But their celebrations were shortlived in an unprecedented turn of events where it has transpired that Royal waterpolo team resorted to using an extra player in the pool during a crucial period of the game to gain an undue advantage over their rivals.
What was stunning was that none of the officials present, the crowd or the opposing camp failed to notice this change.
This phase happened to go on for more than three minutes during which time Royal scored a crucial third goal and denied the Thomians several attacking opportunities to open their score.
Video analysis show evidence how Royal coaching team surreptitiously place an extra player away from the prying eyes of opposing camp and referees of the game in what appears to be a well orchestrated tactical move.
It is unclear what action should be or will be taken against Royal for this type of reprehensible conduct that has put the result in doubt and also the future of series.
