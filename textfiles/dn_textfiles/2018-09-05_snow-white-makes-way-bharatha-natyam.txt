Snow White makes way into  Bharatha Natyam

Nirmalanjali, the Academy of Bharatha Natyam, now 32 years old, finds joy in reviving today some of the past productions that enthralled the audience. Besides traditional classical presentations as well as folk dances, there were many innovative ventures.
One such was the ‘Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs’ adopted from the folktale collections of the German academics, Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm Brothers titled ‘Children and Household Tales’ published in 1812 which subsequently gained phenomenal worldwide recognition as classic fairy tales.
The story is about a wicked queen who, envious of the beauty of her step-daughter Snow White, orders her murder, but later discovers that she was still alive hiding in a cottage with seven friendly miners. Disguising herself as a hag, the queen brings a poisoned apple to Snow White who falls into a death-like sleep that could be broken only by the kiss of a prince.
The memory of its bringing the house down when it was put on the boards two decades ago by Nirmalanjali cannot be forgotten. The Chief Guest V P Dhananjayan, the founder director of the renowned academy of classical dance and music ‘Bharatha Kalanjali’, Chennai, was profuse in praising the participants, especially the little children who performed as dwarfs, for their entertaining acting.
The 32nd Anniversary Celebration Programme of Malarum Ninaivugal (Blossoming Memories) will be held under the patronage of Dr Arunthathy Sri Ranganathan. The guests of honours will be Nirmala Raghunathan, President, Sri Lanka Tamil Women’s Union and Selvi Sachithanandan, Principal, Kalalaya School of Dance and Music.
