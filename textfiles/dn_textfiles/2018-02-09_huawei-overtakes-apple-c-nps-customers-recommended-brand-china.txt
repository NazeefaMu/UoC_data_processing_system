Huawei overtakes Apple as C-NPS customers  recommended brand in China

China-leading brand rating organization Chnbrand, recently released China Net Promoter Score Index (C-NPS) research results for 2018.
With a score of 17.8 points, Huawei has overtaken Apple for the first time as the C-NPS Customers ‘Most Recommended Brand in China’s Mobile Phone Industry 2018, making it the first ever local mobile phone brand to take the first place on this list.
As China’s first system assessing customer willingness to recommend things, the C-NPS offers independent, scientifically sound and latest survey results to reflect consumers’ voices and willingness to recommend products or services. It is therefore a key indicator for measuring brand-specific word of mouth and customer loyalty. Huawei’s having been named the C-NPS Customers‘ Most Recommended Brand in China’s Mobile Phone Industry 2018 is attributable not just to the fact that its consistent customer-centric strategy has been widely accepted in the market, but more importantly to its success by staying focused on technological innovation.
“We’ve built our success upon taking quality as the top priority and making continuous investment in innovation, which is also the primary reason why Huawei is increasingly accepted by consumers”, said the head of Huawei Consumer Business. “Going forward, we will stay true to our business philosophy that ‘Huawei consumer business’s competitiveness starts from and ends at consumers’ and keep innovating in a future-oriented manner, thereby bringing global consumers radically improved user experiences and taking the lead in industrial changes”, he further added.
Innovation has been the primary driving force for Huawei’s continuous rapid growth over the past decades. Huawei has long been creating value for the industry, the markets and consumers through continuous innovation, as it spends over 10% of annual sales revenue on R&D. Based on continuous investment in technological R&D and tight quality control, Huawei smartphones have become increasingly popular with global consumers.
