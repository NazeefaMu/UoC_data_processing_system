Errant traders in Akkaraipattu, Addalaichenai warned

Health Department officials inspected hotels, eateries and trade centres in the Akkaraipattu and the Addalaichenai areas and issued warnings to several errant traders last week.
A high number of traders in the areas selling unhygienic food items were issued warnings and some locations were closed down during the inspection.
