JO ready for bond issue debate - Rohitha

The Joint Opposition said they are ready even for a five-day debate on the Central Bank Bond Report.
MP Rohitha Abeygunawardana said they will expose what was missing on the Bond report papers.
Addressing the media at the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) office at Battaramulla yesterday Abeyagunawardana said even the President has said that the debate on the bond commission report is an eye wash.
He said the JO has suspicion that the government is attempting to postpone elections and trying to bring in new laws.
He said their is a likelihood for the government to be split after the LG election with a possibility of a group of UNP and SLFP MPs forging an alliance with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
