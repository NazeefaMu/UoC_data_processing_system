Duchamp’s last riddle

By now, the story has become a legend: in 1917, artist Marcel Duchamp took a urinal, signed it with a pseudonym, and submitted it for an exhibition put on by the Society of Independent Artists—who rejected it. Fountain, as he winkingly titled the urinal, was one of his ready-mades: a manufactured object that he deemed artworks in an effort to throw off the yoke of what he called “retinal art” in favor of a more conceptual and cerebral one.
Duchamp was good at gestures. Just six years after the Fountain controversy, he announced he was quitting the art world and would devote the rest of his life to his other passion, chess.
Most people believed he had. But when he died in 1968, at the age of eighty-one, his grandest gesture was revealed: Duchamp had been constructing an artwork in secret for twenty years. He left it behind in his studio on Manhattan’s East Eleventh Street—a mysterious, life-size tableau. It featured a realist sculpture of a naked woman lying on a bed of twigs and leaves with her legs spread open.

She could have been dead or unconscious, except that her left arm held aloft a gas lamp, behind which glowed a landscape of colorful trees and a waterfall.
The uncanny scene was visible through a cutout in what seemed to be a brick wall, which itself was fronted by an old wooden door with two peepholes in it.
Looking through the peepholes was—and still is—the only way to see the tableau.
Duchamp left detailed instructions for how to transport the work out of his studio, and the next year the piece was put on permanent display at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. It immediately inspired—and continues to inspire—much consternation.
The artist Jasper Johns, a Duchamp devotee, called it “the strangest work of art in any museum.”
Questions abound: Is it the scene of a sex crime or some kind of psychological projection? Is it a perverse study in artistic perspective? Did the man who invented ready-mades give up on them in old age and return to retinal art? The air of mystery is further thickened by the artwork’s title—Étant donnés: 1° la chute d’eau, 2° le gaz d’éclairage … (Given: 1. The Waterfall, 2. The Illuminating Gas …)—which reads like a logic puzzle without an answer.
Duchamp died on October 2, 1968. Exactly forty-nine years later, on October 2 of this year, his East Eleventh Street studio was reopened for two weeks to a select group of invited guests.
Inside, visitors discovered a full-scale replica of Étant donnés, accompanied by another, newer riddle.
“Nobody can convince me that he didn’t look at it this way,” says the artist Serkan Ozkaya. “I find it insulting to think that a master of shadows didn’t look at it in the dark.” Ozkaya is talking about Duchamp and Étant donnés, and, indirectly, about his own replica, which is titled We Will Wait. We’re sitting in Duchamp’s former studio, alongside a wall of black plastic sheeting that covers the reconstructed tableau. The industrial material gives the space a gritty, worked-in feel. It makes for a jarring contrast with the glowing, untouchable vision that lies just on the other side.
Way of perception
Étant donnés is not Ozkaya’s first copy. In 2012, he built a gold replica of Michelangelo’s “David” at almost double the scale of the original and drove it through the streets of New York. He often uses (or proposes) reproductions in his work, casually casting off the presumed value of originality. But in the case of Étant donnés, Ozkaya remade the work because he has a theory: he thinks that, in addition to compelling visitors to look in, the artwork is meant to double as a machine that projects out. Given that its form is an enclosed room with two small holes in the door, Étant donnés is a natural camera obscura—an optical device wherein a scene on one side of a wall is projected, upside-down, onto the other side of the wall through a tiny hole. All you’d have to do to see the image it projects is enshroud the space outside of it in darkness.
So that’s what Ozkaya did, about two and half years ago. “I hadn’t even seen the work until I had the idea of it operating as a camera obscura,” he admits. -Paris Review
