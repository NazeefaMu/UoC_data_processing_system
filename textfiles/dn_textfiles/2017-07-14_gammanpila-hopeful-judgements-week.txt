Gammanpila hopeful of judgements this week

Cases on election delay:
The judgements of the cases filed before the Supreme Court on the delay of the Local Government election would most probably be delivered within this week, Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Leader Udaya Gammanpila said.
He said three cases had been filed against the delay of the election. The hearing of the cases has been completed. He made these observations addressing a press conference at the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya political Office at Pitakotte yesterday.
However, that the elections have been delayed long. No body takes the responsibility of the delay.
"The Election Commission and the minister are passing the ball to each other," Gammanpila said. "However, the matter is in the hands of the Leader of the House as it is his responsibility to take up the Amendment Bill into debate in Parliament," he said.
He said if the Government fails to hold the election in October, the Joint Opposition would come into streets to protest.
