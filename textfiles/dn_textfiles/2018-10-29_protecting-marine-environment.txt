Professor Atsuko Kanehara
In an exclusive interview with the Daily News, Professor Kanehara expressed her views about the purpose of her visit, the importance of promoting the Free and Open Indo-Pacific strategy, adoption of the Third Basic Plan on Japans Ocean policy, sharing knowledge and experiences with Sri Lanka, maritime security and harnessing the power of the Ocean.
Excerpts of the Interview:
Q: What is the purpose of your visit? Your thoughts on the reaction of the audience to your guest lecture at Colombo University?
A: I was invited to deliver a lecture on the Free and Open Indo-Pacific strategy and Japans maritime policy at the Colombo University. There were so many students and academics beyond my expectations. There were a number of professors and diplomats too. There were many questions I had to answer. The most interesting thing was the number of questions and the high concern of the audience about China. When I delivered similar lectures in India and in Bangladesh recently, there were questions about China and Japan’s relationship with China. But in Sri Lanka, the concern was higher than in those two countries. Maybe it is because Sri Lanka is situated close to the South China Sea. I think that is the reason why Sri Lankan people and academics have a high concern about China. As a whole, I was impressed by the way the audience understood my presentation. It was a very satisfying experience.
Q: Can you briefly explain Japan’s Basic Act on Ocean Policy, its background and purpose?
A: The enactment of the Basic Act on Ocean Policy took place in 2007. The aim was to find answers to a whole host of ocean-related issues that were coming to the fore at the time. The ocean was playing an increasingly important role in securing food, resources and energy, transportation, environmental protection and security among others. The Basic Act on Ocean Policy outlined guiding principles on ocean-related matters and set out the foundations for ocean policy, including the formulation of the Basic Plan on Ocean Policy. It also advocated the establishment of the Headquarters for Ocean Policy, headed by the Prime Minister, with the aim of comprehensively and systematically addressing ocean policy across all relevant government ministries and agencies. Before this act came to be in Japan there was no proper distribution of power among various ministries and agencies when it came to dealing issues related to the Ocean. But with this act, we tried to integrate and synthesize Japanese ocean policy among ministries and agencies.
The goal is to develop in a parallel manner, the integrative system with the Headquarter, on the one hand, and the individual system with the distribution of power among ministries and agencies, on the other hand. After the establishment of the Headquarters, an Advisory Council for the Headquarters was also formulated. Every two years councillors are appointed by the Prime Minister and I have served as councillor since 2016. These institutional developments and the legislative development tried to integrate and synthesize Japanese ocean policy. Earlier ocean policies were taken by each ministry and agencies, individually and separately. The basic plan was enacted in 2008. It should be renewed and updated every five years. So this year (2018) the Third Basic Plan was enacted.
Q: The second basic plan on Ocean policy I am told, focused on establishing Japan as a maritime country, including “International cooperation and contribution to the international community, based on the philosophy, “From a country protected by the Ocean to a country that protects the Ocean.” What is the most prominent feature in the Third Basic Plan?
A: The second Basic Plan on Ocean Policy was formulated in 2013. It set out a number of priorities aimed at establishing Japan as a maritime country, including “International cooperation and contribution to the international community,” “Wealth and prosperity through ocean development and utilization of the sea”.
However, in the third basic plan, the main pillar is comprehensive maritime security. In the act as well as the first and second basic plan maritime security was there but in a sporadic manner. But in the third basic plan maritime security is the main pillar. After the World War II, devastation, especially my parents’ generation was very sensitive to issues such as further militarization, national interests, security etc.
I feel that Japanese government until now has not dealt with military or the security issue in a comprehensive manner. So in the third basic plan of the ocean policy, it was the first time for the Japanese government to openly discuss security.
The salient point is maritime security has been explained in the third basic plan very widely and very broadly.
Not only the defence issues but also the law enforcement, disaster relief, managing resources, environmental destruction, illegal migration and smuggling, fishing etc. are broadly and widely explained under the subject of comprehensive maritime security.
In brief, we have tried to encompass maritime security on a broader scale while emphasizing that proactive measures have to be taken to guarantee safety and peace of mind for the people of Japan and safeguard the country’s marine interests.
Q: In post-war Sri Lanka more than the security concerns, Ocean is viewed as a resource for food, promoting tourism etc. Do you think a comprehensive Ocean policy similar to that of Japan will help Sri Lanka to harness the power of the Ocean in a more beneficial manner?
A: Of course for Japan the food and natural resources are related to ocean policies. Japan has very little natural resources and Japan heavily depends on imports. So in that sense ocean policies should include policies for harnessing oceans resources. Also, Japan is a country surrounded by sea in all directions and in that sense Japan is similar to Sri Lanka. But in addition tourism too is important to your country and Sri Lanka too is a maritime nation.
Japan was in a similar situation where there was no proper coordination between institutions engaged in handling matters related to the ocean. As I mentioned earlier in 2007 the basic act was enacted and since then integration and synthetization of ocean policies among ministries and agencies have gathered pace.
It is showing very encouraging results. In your country too I believe it is preferable to have a system which integrates and synthesize different ministries and agencies in ocean policies.
However, Sri Lanka in this regard should identify their own priorities and aims. Maybe Sri Lanka too could have one institution like the headquarters in Japan to coordinate issues related to the Ocean. Unity is a powerful tool for success.
Q: Is Japan concerned about the growing influence of China in the Indian Ocean region?
A: Japan is aware of China’s growing influence in the Indian Ocean. But the more important matter for Japan is what is happening in the East and the South China Sea. Japan believes a free and open maritime order based on the rule of law is a cornerstone for peace and prosperity in the international community.
Q: What are your thoughts on current relations between Japan and Sri Lanka?
A: The two countries have enjoyed excellent relations since ancient times. I think these are on the up viewing by the bilateral visits, cooperation and exchanges between the two nations.
Between Sri Lanka and Japan, there have been many cooperation on human resources development, law enforcement, disaster relief, counter-terrorism, fisheries sector and post-conflict reconstruction among others. I believe there is space for further growth.
