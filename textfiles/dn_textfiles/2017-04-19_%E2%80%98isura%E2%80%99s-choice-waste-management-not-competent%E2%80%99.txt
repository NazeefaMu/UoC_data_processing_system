‘Isura’s choice for waste management not competent’

The British Company recommended by Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya for a waste management project had no technical or financial ability to start a project of this nature, said Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development yesterday.
The Ministry in a press release said 17 questions were raised regarding the project report submitted by the British Company SJP Waste to Energy Ltd (UK) when it was considered by the Technical Evaluation Committee. This was notified to the Director of the Waste Management Authority and the Chief Minister in October 2016, but no answer has been received to the questionnaire to date.
The release said anyone is free to implement a pilot project at any garbage dumping venue and prove its success without any obstruction.
