Free textbooks sent to schools

All free textbooks received by the Department of Educational Publications have already been sent to government schools countrywide by now, said Commissioner General of the Educational Publications Department I. M. K. B. Ilangasinghe.
Schools that need more textbooks to be distributed among students free of charge would be supplied shortly in January next year. School heads have been instructed in a circular to send their additional requirement of textbooks to be distributed among students at the outset of the school academic year of 2018, he said.
He was speaking at a media conference yesterday in Kuliyapitiya at the request of Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam.
For the printing of free textbooks for students, Rs. 3 billion had been spent this year, Ilangasinghe said. All school heads have been instructed to motivate students to handle free textbooks with love and care as that will lead to save national wealth in billions of rupees in the future.
However, school heads have been instructed not to issue the students with torn or damaged textbooks, he added.
