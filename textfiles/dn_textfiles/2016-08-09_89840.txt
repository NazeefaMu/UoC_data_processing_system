The warm glow of nostalgia

In my opinion, cricket loves its past. It is terrified of the future and not too sure about the present. The cancerous T20 has crept into the game big time and hence I am terrified. The issue of the death certificate is not far away.
Till death do us part, the cricket fanatics still have the good fortune that it has so much to reminisce about. Decades of polishing these anecdotes have given them a luster that more recent cricketing exploits in the ODI’S and the T20”s tends to lack. A man who is used to classical music can never be satisfied with Rock music or the like.
How joyous it must have been to have been inspired by the authority of Sir Len Hutton or how wondrous to recall the energy and aggression of Fred Trueman.
I can vividly recall the days in the early seventies, when I was a student in England. The Indians were touring England in that scorching hot summer of 1971. Abid Ali, the Indian military medium pacer was destroying England’s middle order.
In this same team India had their distinctive trio of devilish spin bowlers, Bishen Bedi, Chandrasekhar and Venkatraghavan. Abid Ali and Eknath Solkar the gentle medium pacers were there just to take the shine off the new ball. (When Solkar played for the Indian Schoolboys in 1964 I represented Ceylon under the captaincy of Anura Tennekoon).
England had in their ranks fast bowlers of the caliber of John Snow, Peter Lever and John Price, whose run up started somewhere in the stands.
Solkar and Abid Ali in contrast looked totally harmless. Short of stature-they had about them the distinct air of cannon fodder.
Solkar over the years managed to dismiss Geoffrey Boycott so many times that some bold observers were even heard to whisper the word ‘bunny’ in connection with the great man. And on the morning of 5 August 1971, Abid Ali disposed off Jameson, Edrich, Fletcher and D’Olivera to leave England on 41 for 4. For on that morning as Abid Ali bowled his little wobblies, England collapsed in abject submission.
“If Yorkshire has been the cradle of cricket in England, Bombay has played an identical role in India.’ states Ramachandra Guha in his book, called “Wickets in the East.”
He further says the ‘the dominance of the two teams in these countries cricketing histories is such that what is said of Yorkshire-that if it is strong, England is strong could just as easily be said of Bombay and India.
The similarities do not end there. Both sides have specialized in classically correct batsmen: for example Sutcliffe, Hutton and Boycott for Yorkshire; Merchant, Madave, Apte and Gavaskar for Bombay. Again both teams have been able to call upon, almost at will a succession of wily slow left arm bowlers: Peel, Rhodes, Verity and Wardle in the one case. Jamshedji, Mankad, Nadkarni and Shivalkar in the other.”
“When Sanjay Manjrekar and Sachin Tendulkar guided India to four draws against an infinitely superior Pakistan side in the winter of 1989, they were carrying on a remarkable tradition initiated by Vijay Merchant in the nineteen-thirties and forties, consolidated by Vijay Manjrekar and Poly Umrigar in the fifties and sixties, and raised to soaring heights by Dilip Sardesai, Sunil Gavaskar and Dilip Vengsarkar in the seventies and eighties.
The essential continuity of this tradition was maintained by Sachin Tendulkar and Ravi Shastri. ”
