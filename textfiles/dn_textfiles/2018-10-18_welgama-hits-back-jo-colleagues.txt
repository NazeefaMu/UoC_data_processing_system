Welgama hits back at JO colleagues

Joint Opposition (JO) MP Kumara Welgama yesterday hit back at his JO colleagues who attacked him for his remarks over the future leadership of the country and the SLFP.
He convened a press conference in Kalutara to reply to the allegations levelled against him by several JO members.
“I am not a political slave. I speak forthright.
I prefer Mahinda Rajapaksa’s leadership, but the SLFP is a common man’s party and nobody can demand that its future leader must only be a Rajapaksa family member. I am against a coalition government that will give the ruling power back to an individual who destroyed the country. That is why all are attacking me. If I leave the SLFP, I would join a leftist party,” he commented.
“A JO MP, who wears full suit, knelt down in front of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe asking for a ministerial post in the 100-day interim Government. There is blood on both the hands of another young JO MP. His father is a respected politician but the son is different,” MP Welgama hinted at the MPs who levelled accusations against him.
