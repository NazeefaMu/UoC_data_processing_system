Meters mandatory for three wheelers from May 1

Meters for all three wheelers will be made mandatory from May 1, National Council for Road Safety Dr. Sisira Kodagoda said.
The legal requirement is implemented under the direction of Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva to ensure a quality transport service to the public. He said that under this measure three wheeler drivers are required to issue a receipt to their customers for the fee charged for each trip.
The law was to be implemented from April 1. It was postponed by a few weeks on requests made by taxi driver associations.
