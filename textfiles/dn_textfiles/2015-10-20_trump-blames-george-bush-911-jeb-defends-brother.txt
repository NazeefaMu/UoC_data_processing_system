Trump blames George Bush for 9/11, Jeb defends brother

US: Donald Trump has claimed a lot of things in his quest to maintain high ratings for his United States presidential campaign, but preventing the 9/11 terrorist attacks that shook the US and the world is a new pretence. Even for Trump.
Trump, the flamboyant front-runner in the 15-candidate Republican field, provoked a tit for tat with rival Jeb Bush last week by saying Jeb's brother, George W. Bush, must share some of the blame for the four co-ordinated attacks that killed nearly 3000 people, because it occurred during his "reign".
Then, Mr Trump said he had "a bigger heart" and was "more competent" at handling the challenges such mass catastrophes bring. But maybe that claim wasn't enough to generate debate - or massive headlines - so on Sunday, Mr Trump went a step further.
"I'm extremely tough on people coming into this country," he said on the Fox News Sunday programme.
"I believe that if I were running things, I doubt those families would have - I doubt that those people would have been in the country." The 19 hijackers in the attacks all entered the United States legally on temporary visas, although a 9/11 commission report criticised flaws in the system that handled their applications.
Mr Trump said his own tough stance on illegal immigration would have made it difficult for the attacks to be carried out in the first place.
He had already grabbed headlines for calling Mexicans rapists and drug dealers, promising to deport 12,000 Mexicans, planning to build a great, big wall on the Mexican border (paid by the southern neighbour's government) and failing to curb anti-Muslim sentiment when he had a chance. Mr Bush said Mr Trump's comments about the September 11 attacks called his credibility into question.
