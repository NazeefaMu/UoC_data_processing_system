Cathay Pacific celebrates 25 years in Sri Lanka

Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific Airways celebrates 25 years of service in Sri Lanka this month. The airline commenced its flights to Colombo in October 1993 with just two flights a week. Since then the airline has expanded its services to the island offering greater choice and convenience to customers travelling to and from Sri Lanka via Cathay Pacific’s extensive international network and the regional network of sister airline, Cathay Dragon.
Launching a series of celebrations in October, the airline announced a limited period flash sale with up to 25% discount on Economy Class flights from Colombo to select destinations.
Cathay Pacific Airways also offers amongst the fastest flying times between Colombo and North America, with special all-inclusive return fares under the flash sale offer. The promotional offer is also available for popular destinations in Japan and Korea with attractive fares in Economy Class.
Commenting on the launch of flash sale, Vishnu Rajendran, Country Lead – Sri Lanka and Maldives for Cathay Pacific Airways said “Sri Lanka has always been an important market in our network and we continually strive to offer seamless connections for Sri Lankans travelling from Colombo to key destinations in Asia, North America and Australia via our Hong Kong hub.”
The two day sale ends by mid-night of October 2, 2018 and bookings made using this offer are valid for travel outbound until 31 October 2018 subject to seat availability.
Cathay Pacific currently connects Sri Lanka to the world with daily non-stop flights between Colombo and Hong Kong operated by Airbus A330-300 aircraft featuring the award-winning fully flat-bed Business Class seats together with ergonomically designed Economy Class seats.
