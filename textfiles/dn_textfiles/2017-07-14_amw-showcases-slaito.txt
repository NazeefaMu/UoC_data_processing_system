AMW showcases at SLAITO

Following the recent launch of the 2017 Nissan Civilian, AMW recently showcased the new Nissan Civilian at the SLAITO exhibition giving visitors a firsthand look at why the new Nissan Civilian is a segment leader.
Marketed as a segment leader in fuel economy and power, the Nissan also has a plush interior making each journey a memorable one for its passengers.
AMW also showcased their passenger and dual purpose versions of the Nissan Urvan which gives customers the option of choosing custom seating arrangements according to their requirement, samples of which were on display at the exhibition.
Similarly the dual purpose Nissan Urvan is ‘P’ registered where the driver does not require a heavy vehicle license, another reason why the Nissan Urvan is a more suitable option for new buyers. Exhibition visitors were also given the chance to test drive the 2017 Nissan Urvan and experience its segment leading features. AMW Capital Leasing together with Nissan made SLAITO even more exciting by giving Nissan Urvan customers the chance to purchase the Urvan with no monthly payments for the entire first year while Nissan Civilian customers were lucky enough to be able to lease the Nissan Civilian only at 7.99% interest for the first year, making the Nissan Urvan and Nissan Civilian attractive buying options in its segment.
