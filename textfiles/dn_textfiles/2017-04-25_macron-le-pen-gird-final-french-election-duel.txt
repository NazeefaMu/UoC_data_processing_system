Macron, Le Pen gird for final French election duel

FRANCE: Pro-European centrist Emmanuel Macron and anti-immigration leader Marine Le Pen began a final duel for the French Presidency Monday, after a first round of voting delivered a stunning blow to the traditional political class.
Macron is clear favourite to become France’s youngest president after topping Sunday’s ballot with 23.75 percent of votes, slightly ahead of National Front (FN) leader Le Pen on 21.53 percent, according to final results.
“For months and again today I’ve heard the doubts, the anger and the fears of the French people. Their desire for change too,” 39-year-old Macron told thousands of flag-waving, cheering supporters in Paris on Sunday.
Polls suggest the ex-investment banker would beat Le Pen easily in the second round run-off on May 7, which will not feature a candidate from the traditional left or right for the first time in six decades. The outcome capped an extraordinary campaign in a deeply divided and demoralised France, which has been rocked by a series of terror attacks since 2015 and remains stuck with low economic growth.
Le Pen, who has hardened her anti-immigration and anti-Europe rhetoric over the past week, hailed a “historic vote” in front of her supporters, adding: “The first stage has been passed.”
The French vote was being closely watched as a bellwether for populist sentiment following the election of Donald Trump as US President and Britain’s vote to leave the EU.
Le Pen follows in the footsteps of her father Jean-Marie, who made it through to the 2002 presidential run-off in what came as a political earthquake for France. Le Pen Senior went on to suffer a stinging defeat when mainstream parties closed ranks to keep him out.
Though Le Pen came in behind Macron, there was joy at the FN’s election party Sunday night in Henin-Beaumont, a former coal mining town in northern France, with outbursts of the Marseillaise national anthem.Macron also drew immediate support from his defeated rivals from the Socialists and Republicans.
Socialist Benoit Hamon, who won a humiliating 6.35 percent, said the left had suffered a “historic drubbing” but urged voters to keep out Le Pen who he said was “an enemy of the republic”.
Scandal-hit Republicans candidate Francois Fillon followed suit, saying: “There is no other choice than voting against the far-right.”
Fillon was seen as a favourite until January when his campaign was torpedoed by allegations that he gave his British-born wife a fictitious job as his parliamentary assistant.
He took 19.91 percent of Sunday’s vote. Support for Communist-backed Melenchon, meanwhile, had surged in recent weeks on the back of assured performances in two televised debates.
He got 19.64 percent of the vote, underlining the strength of anti-establishment sentiment.
The vote took place under heavy security after Thursday’s killing of a policeman on Paris’s Champs-Elysees avenue claimed by the Islamic State group.
With France still under the state of emergency imposed after the Paris attacks of November 2015, around 50,000 police and 7,000 soldiers were deployed to guard voters. .- AFP
