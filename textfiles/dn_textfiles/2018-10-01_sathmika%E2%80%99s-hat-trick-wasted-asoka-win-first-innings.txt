Sathmika’s hat trick wasted as Asoka win first innings

A four wicket haul including a hat trick by Sathmika Fernando was wasted as Asoka College clinched a first innings win over Lumbini College in their under 13 division one cricket encounter played at the Ediriweera Sarathchandra MV ground in Himbutana yesterday.
Invited to bat first in a match reduced to 75 overs due to a damp wicket, Asoka College were restricted to a first innings score of 140. Buleetha Mintharu batted the full innings to score 53 off 105 balls which included five hits to the ropes. In addition to Sathmika’s four wicket haul Akash Wewalkada, Yasod Kavindu, Sathsara Pathirana and Shalaka Thiwantha captured a wicket each.
Lumbini’s hopes were dashed as Disandu Jayawardena grabbed five wickets while Ishara Sandamal complemented him with three wickets to demolish the Lumvini first innings for 90.
With a minimum of 10 overs left in the game Dulaj Hettiarachchi smashed 57 off 39 balls with 7 boundaries and 3 sixes to see Asoka end on 99/1 in their second essay.
Asoka 1st innings 140 in 42 overs (Buleetha Mintharu 53, Hirun Matheesha 33, Rashmika Arosha 19, Sathmika Fernando 4/44) and 99/1 in 12 overs (Dulaj Hettiarachchi 57 not out, Nipun Mathisha 27, Pasibdu Manisha 1/19)
Lumbini 1st innings 90 in 25.5 overs (Sathmika Fernando 18, Shalaka Thiwantha 19, Ishara Sandamal 3/36, Disandu Jayawardena 5/20)
