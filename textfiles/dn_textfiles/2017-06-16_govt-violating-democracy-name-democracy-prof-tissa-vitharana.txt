Govt. violating democracy in the name of democracy: Prof. Tissa Vitharana

It seems that the United National Party (UNP) needs something similar to that of Black July in order to postpone elections. This is what stands behind the recent attacks on shops and mosques of Muslims and not arresting Ven. Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera, said Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) Leader Prof. Tissa Vitharan.
Addressing a press conference held at the LSSP Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the only way of postponing elections is by declaring a state of emergency which could be done only if racist violence irrupts in the country.
But it would be much more serious and dangerous than the 27 year war. Nobody listened to the LSSP in the past and as a result the 27 years long war commenced.
According to Prof. Vitharana, the Government is violating democracy in the name of democracy and doing nothing to control the development of ethnic tension. If violence irrupts in Sri Lanka, the US will definitely intervene just as it did in other countries in the world and destroy the entire country. US wants this Government to continue without any trouble in order to make use of the Trincomalee harbour.
Prof. Vitharana pointed out that there are only 100 million Tamils in the world, while 70 percent of them are in Tamil Nadu. But there are 1,000 million Muslims throughout the world. Fundamentalists are presently bombing many countries in the world. Fundamentalists of all religions in Sri Lanka are at present active.
The Government needs to control them. The Sri Lankan people showed what they needed on May 1st this year. Since then, the Government is trying its best to postpone elections. Earlier the people had no liking to this Government, but now they really hate it, he added.
