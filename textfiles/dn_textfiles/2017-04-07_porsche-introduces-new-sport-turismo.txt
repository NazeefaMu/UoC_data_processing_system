Porsche introduces new Sport Turismo

Porsche is expanding the Panamera family with the addition of a new body version, the Panamera Sport Turismo which celebrated its world première at the Geneva Motor Show recently.
Based on the successful sports saloon, the new version once again makes a profound statement in the luxury segment with its unmistakable design.
The Sport Turismo, with up to 404 kW/550 hp, is more versatile than any other model in its class. With a large tailgate, low loading edge, increased luggage compartment volume and a 4+1 seating concept, the new Panamera model offers the perfect combination of everyday usability and maximum flexibility. The Panamera Sport Turismo is a step forward into a new segment, but retains all of the values and attributes that are characteristics of Porsche.
The Sport Turismo utilises all the innovations introduced with the brand new Panamera model line launched only last year. These include the digital Porsche Advanced Cockpit, pioneering assistance systems such as Porsche InnoDrive, including adaptive cruise control, chassis systems such as rear axle steering, the Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control (PDCC Sport) electronic roll stabilisation system and powerful powertrains. In addition, all Panamera Sport Turismo vehicles are equipped with Porsche Traction Management (PTM) – an active all-wheel drive system with electronically controlled multi-plate clutch – as standard. As of the S models, adaptive air suspension with three-chamber technology is also supplied as standard.

The Porsche Panamera family includes different versions of the model such as the Panamera 4, Panamera 4S, Panamera 4S Diesel, Panamera 4 E-Hybrid and Panamera Turbo.
First adaptively extendible roof spoiler in the segment
At the top of the vehicle, the roof extends into an adaptive spoiler.
The angle of the roof spoiler is set in three stages depending on the driving situation and selected vehicle settings, and generates an additional downforce of up to 50 kg on the rear axle.Up to a speed of 170 km/h, the aerodynamic guide element – a central system component of the Porsche Active Aerodynamics (PAA) – stays in its retracted position with an angle of minus seven degrees, which reduces drag and thus optimises fuel consumption.
