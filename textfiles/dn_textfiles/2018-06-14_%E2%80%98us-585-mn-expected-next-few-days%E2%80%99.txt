Hambantota Port
‘US$ 585 mn expected in next few days’

Co-cabinet Spokesperson, Minister Rajitha Senaratne yesterday stated that the last tranche of US$ 585 million for the Hambantota Port would be paid within the next few days.
Addressing the weekly Cabinet media briefing, he explained that Cabinet had resolved all land issues and the Chinese company would pay the money soon.
The media last week reported that China Merchants Port Holdings Company (CMPort) Ltd, who was involved in the Hambantota Port, had put on hold the last tranche over a dispute involving the reclaimed land. They had also requested that an artificial entertainment zone be allowed on it. The Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), however, had rejected this proposal stating that the land gazetted was for only marine and port-related activities.
The Minister however did not elaborate on what concessions the Cabinet had agreed to or how the land issue was resolved.
