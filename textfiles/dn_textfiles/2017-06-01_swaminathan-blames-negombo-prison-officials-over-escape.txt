Swaminathan blames Negombo prison officials over escape

Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation and Hindu Religious Affairs Minister D.M. Swaminathan conducted a sudden observation tour of the Negombo Prison on Tuesday to investigate the incident of the escape of four inmates of the Negombo Prison.
The Minister stated that he was surprised at the way the prison officers discharged their duties until the inmates dug a hole in the wall and escaped. He said all officers of the Negombo Prison should accept the responsibility of this incident as it was a lapse on their part.
After the sudden tour of the prison, the minister expressed suspicion whether the prison officers had aided the prisoners to escape.
He called for n immediate report regarding this incident. He said the Commissioner General of prisons should have acted more responsibly, pointing out that he had failed to even visit the Negombo Prison until the minister had gone there himself in the evening to investigate.
He warned that action will be taken to make certain changes in high ranking positions in the Prisons Department and all positions in prisons islandwide.
