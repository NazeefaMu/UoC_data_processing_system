WATERWAY  TO GO

The boom in the spice trade was a direct result of Sri Lanka being colonised by the Portuguese and then the Dutch. The Dutch organized mass cultivation of cinnamon plants, with many plantations blossoming along the west coast of the country. At a time when horsepower came in the form of actual horses and roads didn’t have smooth asphalt, and moving goods was a challenge large canals were created in key places to transport goods. The cinnamon once prized as highly as gold had to be taken from the plantations to the Colombo or Negombo ports to be traded and sold, and the demand for it exceeded the rate at which it could be transported by land.
To solve this problem, the Dutch built a canal system spanning over 100 km, which provided fast and efficient transport to this sought-after spice. Pictures will show you that, during their heyday, these canals resembled those of Venice, with boats gliding across the water like oversized Gondolas. The cinnamon trade in Sri Lanka declined after the British took over the colonial reigns and tea was given more prominence. This, combined with the development of the country’s road infrastructure and the introduction of railways, was the final nail in the canal’s coffin. The canals were gradually abandoned and eventually overrun by nature, and finally only monitor lizards glided across the waters.
Large-scale cleanups
However, the canals are now making a comeback. Large-scale cleanups are restoring them to their former glory and now they are fully accessible all the way to Colombo, just like they were 200 years ago. A canal boat trip can easily be arranged by speaking to the hotel’s travel desk.
If the weather is good and the sea is calm, you can take off from right in front of the hotel in a motor- boat, guided by a fisherman from the area who knows the canals like the back of his hand. If you stay at a Jetwing property and book a tour with the naturalist from the hotel you will learn about the historical story of these canals, as you float along, enjoying the scenery and diverse ecosystems that surround you. Just a short skim across the wavy waters and you come upon the estuary where the canal opens up into the sea. If the sea is rough, the tour begins with a short van ride to the estuary where the boat is waiting. The best time to do this is before 8.30 am when the sun is not at its hottest and the animals are just coming out of their lairs.
The canals have a depth of a little over 2metre and are generally about 50m in width. As you proceed inland, heading east, the bow of the boat cuts through the placid waters, which reflect the blue skies above. Trees line the sides from start to finish, some indigenous to the area like the palm tree, which survives half submerged. I imagine it was waterways like this that inspired Stephen King while writing the final chapters of ‘Birds of Prey’, where German warships wade through unknown tributaries in search of cover. Occasionally, you will see a dark shape passing underneath the surface and the tail of a monitor lizard emerges with grey, weathered scales. They look almost primeval, making you feel like you are on the set of Jurassic Park, but they are harmless, often scampering away into a burrow under the roots of a mangrove tree, which dip into the water and provide great perching spots for blue Kingfishers waiting eagerly to pounce on the first fish that emerges to kiss the surface.
Canal trip
My favourite bird is known as the flying dog and if you are very lucky you might even hear it sing just like one. Just make sure you take a good pair of binoculars or you will miss the smaller attractions and a good zoom lens if you want to capture the colorful butterflies that flit across the boat in more rural parts of the canal.
There are several islands around the canal system that are being built into beach resorts which can only be reached by a barge from the mainland - a rather exciting way of grabbing a snack if you fancy one. Along the way you can also stop at the Canal Café for a quick bite to eat or a drink and gaze on the serenity of the canal and groups of parrots that fly across from time to time. If you’re bored of just sitting in a café, you can stop by the water’s edge, next to the coconut trees and watch as the local coconut climbers clamber up and drop coconuts onto the banks.
Even 13 years on one can still see areas that were affected by the tsunami in 2004, abandoned houses and land now turned into pig farms. The canal trip goes all the way up to the dam at Kozhikode, and after that the boat turns around and heads back to the hotel, where fresh juice and refreshing towels await you at the end of a picturesque adventure. In all, the canal trip that can be organized through Jetwing Beach or Jetwing Blue lasts one hour and thirty minutes. It is almost like a journey back through time to the colonial era when these arteries were filled with boats transporting goods to and fro. A stylish way to explore these natural havens along the old trade routes from Colombo to Negombo without even getting stuck in a traffic jam! Perhaps one day they will be used again and for more than just transporting curious tourists around.
