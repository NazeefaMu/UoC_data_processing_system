Island-wide dengue control programme from June 6 – 8

An island-wide dengue control programme will be held from June 6 to 8 within 76 identified high-risk MOH divisions located in 10 districts in the country, Health Ministry sources said.
According to sources, the programme will be implemented on June 6 and June 7 in the Baticaloa and Kalmunai districts, while the programme will be implemented on June 7 and June 8 in the Colombo, Kalutara, Gampaha, Kandy, Matale, Kegalle, Ratnapura and Puttalam districts.
The programme is to be launched considering the possibility of dengue cases rising in the near futrure, due to the prevailing rainy conditions and floods. A total of 1,300 teams would take part in the programme, including members of the armed forces, Health officials and the police, sources said.
The Health Ministry requested the public to clean their homes, schools, offices and all the other private and public properties, spending at least 30 minutes per week in order to prevent a possible dengue outbreak. Persons in high-risk groups such as infants, pregnant mothers and the elderly, should seek prompt medical treatment for fever, sources added.
