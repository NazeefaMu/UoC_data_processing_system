Sections of the Inland Revenue Bill inconsistent with the Constitution

 
The Supreme Court has ruled that as sections of the draft Inland Revenue Bill are inconsistent with the Constitution, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya informed the Parliament today.
Therefore a referendum seeking two-thirds majority Parliament will have to be sought or the draft Bill would have to be amended, the Speaker informed.
It is expected that rather than seek referendum, amendments would be made to the draft Bill at the Committee stage of the legislative process.
