Kandy out to maintain their supremacy

The Kandy Sports Club was founded in 1874 by a group of expatriate coffee planters and others working in the plantation sector in and around Kandy. In 1888, the club also started playing rugby, hockey and polo.
The home ground was Bogambara grounds until 1939 when the British Colonial Army took over during the Second World War. Later the buildings were taken over by the General Hospital to house its offices; however Kandy SC continued to play rugby at the Bogambara grounds without a club house. In 1949 the Municipal Council released the garbage dumping ground area at Nittawela to the club.
From 1997 to 2009 Kandy SC has won all Presidents’ Trophy Knockout Tournaments with the exception of the 1998 tourney, where it lost 26-30 in the finals to Ceylonese Rugby & Football Club (CR&FC). They have also dominated the Clifford Cup tournament, winning 18 titles in the last twenty years, which is the most number of wins by any club since the expanded competition commenced in 1950. In the period between 1995 and 2012 the club did not lose a single Clifford Cup title, although in 1998 there was no tournament and in 2006 the club withdrew from the tournament. Kandy SC won the league title for a record nine consecutive years between 2000 and 2009.
On March 10, 2010 the rugby team of the Kandy Sports Club left for a 15-day tour of Dubai and South Africa. The club played one match in Dubai and two in South Africa. This was the first time Kandy SC visited two different countries on one tour.
Kandy Sports Club who were the kings of local rugby lived up to their expectations last season by winning both League and the Clifford cup titles which were on offer and this season they are working hard towards retaining their position at the top as a champion outfit..
They are in search of their past glory and in the upcoming 2017/18 season they will have some of the best players in the country led by that speedy centre ex Kingswood and Sri Lanka player in Gayan Weeraratne.
This season they are under the watchful eyes of their head coach, former Trinity, Kandy and Sri Lanka skipper Sean Wijesinghe, ably assisted by former Trinity, Kandy and Sri Lanka player Saliya Kumara. The Manager of the side is former Isipathana, CR and FC and Kandy SC player Kapila Silva.
Kandy SC must be really happy with the squad of players that they have got for this season having a blend of youth and experience that only have to motivate them and do a bit of fine tuning and the boys will deliver the result at the end. The real concern is that every club in Sri Lanka wants to beat them; no matter it can be even Air Force or CH and FC, because at
present they are the reigning champions. Due to this when Kandy is playing a game they are under tremendous pressure, since they are carrying the legacy of the whole Kandy crowd and their expectations are high, so Kandy SC has to somehow deliver the goods by winning all the games for their fans..
There are many new faces turning out for them this season and out of which some of the well known Schools and National players in Ashan Darling (Isipathana/ Havelock’s/Prop forward, Heshan Jansen(Scrum half/Kingswood), Chatura Seneviratne (Fly half / Centre/St.Joseph), Lakshitha Ranaweera(Fly half/Kingswood), Diluksha Dange(Centre/Trinity) , Sanushka
Abeywickrema(Scrum half/Trinity), Kasun Srinath (Full back/Kingswood/CH) who are all out to give off their best display of rugby for their new club Kandy SC in the upcoming season.
