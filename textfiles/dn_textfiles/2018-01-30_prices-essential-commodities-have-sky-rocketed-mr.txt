Prices of essential commodities have sky rocketed - MR

Former President and MP Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday said the prices of essential commodities have sky rocketed and the people find it difficult to make ends meet.
The former President was addressing an election rally in Matugama yesterday.
“The prices of coconut and rice have gone up, but authorities in the government have still not woken up fron their slumber,” he said
Rajapaksa said the people voted for the government expecting essential commodities at a fair rate.
“But the prices of essential items are on the rise shattering their expectations,” he said.
He said the government is harping on the heavy burden of loans left by me since it came into power. “No tangible efforts were taken to develop the country or ease the burden on the people due to the soaring cost of living,” he said
He said he accepted a country in 2005 when LTTE terrorists had to control over the North and the East in addition to heavy burden of loans.
“I was able to win the war on terrorism while providing relief to the people,” Rajapaksa said.
