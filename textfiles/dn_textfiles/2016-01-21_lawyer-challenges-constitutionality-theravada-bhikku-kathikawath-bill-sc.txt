Lawyer challenges constitutionality of Theravada Bhikku Kathikawath Bill in SC

A Special Determination petition challenging the Bill titled, "Theravada Bhikku Kathikawath (Registration)" was yesterday filed before the Supreme Court seeking a determination that several clauses of the said Bill are inconsistent with the Constitution.
Petitioner, Attorney-at-Law Nuwan Ballantudawa, Co-coordinator of the Global Sri Lankan Forum further sought a declaration that the Bill shall become law only through a two-thirds majority in Parliament and the approval of the people at a referendum.
The Petitioner states that the said Bill was presented to the Parliament and placed on the Order Paper of the Parliament on January 12, 2016. The Petitioner states the law intended to be enacted by clauses 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 of the Bill would intrude into, distort and arbitrarily force to change the religious practices, recognised customs developed and followed by the Bhikkus for over thousands of years pertaining to Bikkhu Vinaya and discipline;
He further said the Bill would intrude into, distort and arbitrarily force to change the culture, cultural practices, customs, values and traditions of the people residing in Sri Lanka, especially of those belonging to the "Sinhalese nationality", whose culture has been developed, absorbed into and merged with the religious practices, customs and traditions of "the Buddha Sasana", as manifested, practiced and promoted by the Bhikkus in Sri Lanka for over thousands of years;
He further said the Bill would unwarrantedly and forcibly distort, destroy and change the fundamental traditions, customs and culture followed, practiced and developed by the people in Sri Lanka of giving the foremost place to Buddhism, in the spheres of both the State administration and day-to-day personal behaviour;
He further said the Bill would unlawfully and unfairly infringe and violate the religious and cultural rights and freedoms of the Sri Lankans and Buddhists living in Sri Lanka.
He further said, the new law would arbitrarily and irrationally create divisions and separations among the Bhikkus and the Buddhists living in Sri Lanka;
The petitioner observed that State legislation should not interfere with religion or cultural practices and customs (except to make laws to protect rights of those of other deprived religions and cultures).
He said the intended law would arbitrarily discriminate the Bhikkus against the Clergy of other religions in Sri Lanka;
The Attorney General was made a respondent to this application in terms of Article 134 (1) of the Constitution.
The petitioner had filed the petition through Counsel H. M. Thillakarathne and senior counsel Kanishka Vitharana.
