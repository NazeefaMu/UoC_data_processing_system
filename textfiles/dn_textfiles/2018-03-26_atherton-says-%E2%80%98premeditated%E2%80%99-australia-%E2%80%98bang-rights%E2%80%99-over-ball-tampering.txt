Atherton says ‘premeditated’ Australia ‘bang to rights’ over ball-tampering

LONDON, Saturday: Michael Atherton said the “premeditated” nature of Australia's ball-tampering during the ongoing third Test against South Africa made it different from the “dirt in pocket affair” that blighted his career.
Australia captain Steve Smith dramatically admitted his side were guilty of ball-tampering after the third day's play in Cape Town on Saturday.
He added the “senior leadership group” had spoken about breaking one of the Laws of Cricket during the lunch interval before team-mate Cameron Bancroft did so -- and then tried to hide his offence from the on-field umpires -- in the next session of play.
Back in 1994, then England captain Atherton was seen taking dirt from his pocket and rubbing it on the ball during a Test against South Africa at Lord's.
He was later fined £2,000 for failing to disclose the dirt to the match referee but remained as England captain despite calls for his resignation.
But Atherton said the deliberate nature of Australia's actions, allied to the fact it involved a junior team member in the 25-year-old Bancroft, appearing in just his eighth Test, made it a different case to his own.
