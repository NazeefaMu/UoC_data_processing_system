SLC clears the air on player injuries

Captain of Sri Lanka’s national cricket team Angelo Mathews is expected to return home to join his family this week, Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) announced yesterday.
SLC in a media release cited that prior to the tour Mathews had indicated that he would need time off on personal grounds and SLC confirmed yesterday that he has been granted permission to return home.
Mathews also suffered an ankle injury while batting during his match-winning half-century against South Africa in the second T20 international at Johannesburg on Sunday.
Sri Lanka’s win leveled the three-match series 1-all. The third and deciding T-20 match which is to be played on January 25 at Cape Town will be captained by Dinesh Chandimal.
Meanwhile Sri Lanka’s fast bowler Nuwan Pradeep and opener Dhanuskha Gunathilaka are also expected to return home after suffering injuries.
SLC confirmed that both players are in need of rest to recover from their injuries.
The national team’s physiotherapist confirmed that Pradeep sustained a hand injury following the match on January 17 and has been requested to rest. He will out for four weeks.
Gunathilaka who suffered a back injury has been advised to rest for three weeks for optimal recovery. The team’s physiotherapist conferred that it would be better for both individuals to return home and rest since they would not be able to continue playing in South Africa.
The ODI squad will be announced shortly after a meeting with the selection committee scheduled for today.
