Cable cutting causes power failures

Incidents of cutting of cables from high tension lines in the North Western Province are increasing by the day.
Last month, several instances of this illegal act were reported to the police.
This problem results in power failures which affects households and businesses.
Consumers attribute these activities to the work of dealers in redundant articles. They also say the cut wires are packed in in polythene sacks and transported in lorries which go unchecked by the police and CEB.
