Partnered in human  kindness

In 2016 in Istanbul, five core responsibilities were highlighted in the Agenda for Humanity presented by former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon. They were: (i) political leadership to prevent and end the conflict; (ii) upholding the norms that safeguard humanity; (iii) leaving no one behind; (iv) changing people’s lives by
moving from delivering aid to ending need; and (v) investing in humanity.
More than 150 representatives of national governments representing ministries of foreign affairs, national disaster management offices and military responders represented by national, regional and international civil society and non-governmental organisations, regional organisations, the private sector and academia met in Bangkok last week. Forum met first a decade ago, in the Republic of Korea. Since then, meetings have been held in Singapore, Indonesia, China and Thailand.
Agenda for Humanity
In 2016 in Istanbul, five core responsibilities were highlighted in the Agenda for Humanity presented by former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon.
They were: (i) political leadership to prevent and end the conflict; (ii) upholding the norms that safeguard humanity; (iii) leaving no one behind; (iv) changing people’s lives by moving from delivering aid to ending need; and (v) investing in humanity. More than 20 global initiatives were launched in Istanbul. They include, among others, the Grand Bargain on Efficiency, The New Way of Working, The Global Partnership for Preparedness, and the Connecting Business Initiative.

 
The core commitments on natural disasters and climate change resonated, in particular, were supported by this region – including:
1. Reinforce national and local leadership and capacities in managing disaster and climate-related risks through strengthened preparedness and predictable response and recovery arrangements.
2. Improve the understanding, anticipation and preparedness for disaster and climate-related risks by investing in data, analysis and early warning, and developing evidence-based decision-making processes that result in early action.
3. Increase investment in building community resilience as a critical first line of response, with the full and effective participation of women, and
4. Ensure regional and global humanitarian assistance for natural disasters complements national and local efforts.
Regional adaptation of the agenda for humanity
First, implementation of the WHS commitments must reflect priorities of national governments that are likely to host international assistance to ensure that response provided is consistent with humanitarian principles and standards.
Second, discuss New Ways of Working in this region in practical and operational terms. The concept highlights the need to develop multi-year and multi-stakeholder planning and funding arrangements for coordinated emergency response, preparedness, and resilience.
Third, need to improve understanding of risks, and develop evidence-based decision-making processes that result in timely actions. This is particularly important in the context of slow-onset disasters, like those triggered by El Niño last year.
Fourth, we should discuss a set of more specific themes from the WHS with significant operational implications in this region, particularly those called for by the Grand Bargain, Supporting community engagement through two-way communications and reinforcing accountability mechanisms.
And finally, discuss the evolving humanitarian financing landscape in Asia and related opportunities and challenges.
