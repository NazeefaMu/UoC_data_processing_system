Dr. Lucas wins TT silver at the Asia Pacific Masters Games

Dr. Gerard Nimal Lucas was the sole medalist from Sri Lanka at the Asia Pacific Masters Games held in Penang, Malaysia from September 8 to 15. He won a silver medal in the over 75 TT men’s singles.
Thirteen veteran table tennis players from Sri Lanka (11 men, 2 women) participated in the Asia Pacific Masters Games. In the Over 50 men’s team event, the ‘Butterfly’ team comprising Lalith Priyantha (Captain), Mohamed Ilmi and Nihal Perera were the losing semi-finalists. In the Over 75 men’s singles event, Dr. Nimal Lucas beat Heng Teng Boey, a Malaysian player in the semi-finals by 3 sets to one and lost to Yoshiaki Kadoguchi, a Japanese player in the finals in straight sets.
As the number of entries in the age categories of 30, 40 and 50 events exceeded expectations and because only 8 tables were available for the matches, the organizers of the Masters Games extended the tournament by one extra day. Since it was difficult to change the flight schedules and accommodation, Dr. Lucas (partner Mohamed Laffeer) was deprived of playing in the Over 70 Men’s doubles and the Over 70 men’s team event.
