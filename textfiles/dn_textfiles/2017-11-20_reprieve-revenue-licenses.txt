Reprieve for Revenue Licenses

Vehicles for which revenue licences have not been obtained for five years, will hereafter be considered as vehicles removed from use.
Motor Traffic Department Commissioner General Jagath Chandrasiri said usually vehicles that have not obtained revenue licences for two years are considered to be no longer in use. But, it has been extended to five years based on the humanitarian grounds.
