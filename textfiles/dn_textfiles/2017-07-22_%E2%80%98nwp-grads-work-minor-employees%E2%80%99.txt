‘NWP grads work as minor employees’

About 90 graduates now work as minor employees at the North Western Province (NWP) Education Ministry. Several are serving as sanitary labourers, school watchers, drivers and office peons, North Western Province Education Minister Sandya Kumara Rajapakse said.
He was addressing a parents and teachers’ meeting of the Maliyadewa Girls’ College, Kurunegala recently. He said about 56 of the graduates hold Business Management degrees.
About 25,000 graduates annually pass out from state universities. Over 10,000 graduates in the Kurunegala and Puttalam districts have no employments at present.
“A majority of graduates have done outdated degree courses and they have to wait for years without jobs. NWP A/L students should select subjects that have a demand in the job market. School heads and teachers should enlighten the parents and students on the importance of selecting job-oriented subjects for university entrance examinations.
Nearly 40 unemployed graduates possess special degrees in Russian Language in the NWP and they have no demand in the present job market in Sri Lanka,” the Provincial Education Minister said.
