Fertilizer imported from Pakistan

“In order to solve the existing shortage of fertilizer within Sri Lanka, steps are being taken to import 75,000 tonnes of fertilizer from Pakistan very shortly. President Maithripala Sirisena has already held discussions with the Prime Minister of Pakistan over this issue.
This problem of fertilizer for farmers can be solved by December 28", said Kurunegala District Parliamentarian Sports Minister and Co - Cabinet Spokesman Dayasiri Jayasekara when he was contacted by Daily News on December 14 in Hettipola, Kurunegala.
About 100,000 farmers are reported to be undergoing hardships due to this shortage of fertilizer and hence, steps would be taken early to assist the farmer community by supplying the necessary fertilizer requirements at proper time for them to have a better harvest of paddy this year, Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara added.
