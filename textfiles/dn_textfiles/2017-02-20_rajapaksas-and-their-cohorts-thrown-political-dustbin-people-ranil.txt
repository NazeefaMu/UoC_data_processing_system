Rajapaksas and their cohorts thrown to political dustbin by people: Ranil

The Rajapaksas and their cohorts were thrown to the political dustbin by the people of this country, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
If they try to ruin the future of the youth generation by obstructing development work and the country’s forward march, we will join hands with the youth and seal the lid of that bin to prevent them from making and political comeback, he said.
He was addressing a meeting after launching the Hemmathagama water supply project on February 18.
The project costing Rs. 15,352,30 million funded by the Netherlands, will provide drinking water to people in Hemmathagama, Mavanella, Aranayake, and Rambukkana and 62 surrounding hamlets. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said the 2015 January 8 victory which ousted the Rajapaksa regime had now helped to bring water supplies to Hemmathagama and its environs.
The new water supply project was possible because of the assistance given by the king of Netherlands.
W|e should express our gratitude and thanks to the government of Netherlands, the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister said he was surprised when he understood that Minister Kabir Hashim had allocated such massive funding to develop the Mawanella area including Aranayake and Rambukkana. He had done that to ensure a better future for the people in the area.
The Prime Minister said the government as soon as it assumed power increased salaries of the public sector by Rs. 10,000 and the private sector by Rs. 2,500. Pensioners were given a Rs. 1,000 increment, which was beyond the capacity of the previous regime, The Prime Minister said the government also decreased the price of gas cylinder, milk powder by Rs. 61 per packet whereas flour prices were decreased by Rs. 12,50 and sugar by Rs. 10 per kilo. Price of sprats, salmon, Maldive fish, chili were also reduced and petrol diesel and kerosene oil were decreased.
“Now the government has to cope up with a drought, reduction in rice output and several other problems, but it would not allow the cost of living to increase on account of these problems because people’s welfare was its prime concern. Now rice inputs have been allowed by removing all Customs duties and other taxes to tide over the shortage of local rice. Moreover additional paddy stocks in government warehouses had been released to millers to enable them release additional stocks to the market.
The Prime Minister said the government had now initiated a programme to generate employment opportunities to youth. This would benefit the youth and provide for their future welfare. New industries would be soon opened and Tourism would also be further developed.
The Prime Minister said the debt burden on the Hambantota port left behind by the Rajapaksa regime was reduced by the government by signing a contract with the China Merchant Company to develop the Hambantota area under which China would write off 1,100 million us dollars out of the 1,300 millions dollars leaving us with only 200 million dollars as against one share of the Hambantota Industrial zone project.
Now the Chinese company has suggested to build an oil refinery, a shipyard, cement factory and an LNG power station. Apart from these, it would be possible to launch about 200 to 300 factories in Hambantota and providing employments to the youth.
Parliamentarian Vasudewa Nanayakkara had gone to courts to get the Hambantota framework agreement annulled. If he succeededs in this move, the onus of repaying the 1, 00 million dollars of the Chinese loan would devolve on the people making each indebted by Rs. 12,000 annually. Nanayakkara, who represented the Eheliyagoda seat had done this to prevent the youth from getting jobs. The Prime Minister said work on the Hambantoa Industrial zone would be launched before the end of next month.
Ministers Rauff Hakeem and Kabir Hashim and Deputy Ministers Ranjan Ramanayake and Nalin Bandara spoke.
