Sixteen SLFPers invite SLPP, JO and rest of SLFP to join hands

The 16 SLFPers who left the Government invited the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), Joint Opposition (JO) and the rest of the SLFP to band together to defeat the UNP.
Addressing their supporters outside of Parliament after having crossed over to the Opposition at the opening of the Second Session of Parliament yesterday, Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said, “We will not work according to the whims of the UNP in Government. I invite all our brothers from the SLPP, JO and SLFP to join us to defeat our biggest enemy,the UNP”.
He reiterated that neither the SLPP, JO nor the SLFP could form a Government on their own and it was in unity that their arch rival would be defeated.
The 16 SLFPers resigned from Government after having voted in favour of the no confidence motion against the Prime Minister recently.
