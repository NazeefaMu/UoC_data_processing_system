Chinese charm

The Embassy of the Peoples Republic of China in Colombo and The China Cultural Center will be holding the China Cultural Fair 2018 in order to celebrate the ‘Chinese New Year 2018’. The Chinese New Year also known as the Spring Festival speaks of new beginnings and new life.
Daily News met up with the Embassy Peoples Republic of China, Cultural Attache Liu Dong who spoke about the significance of these events.
“The Lantern Festival is also during the Chinese New Year celebrations. The Spring Festival is also one of the most important festivals in Chinese Culture and for the Chinese people. It has a 4000-year-old history.
Back home
To the Chinese people, it is a time for family gathering, many workers go home to reunite with their families. That is why it is so important and during this season, there is great pressure for Chinese transportation companies to transport all the people back home,” said Dong.
Different regions all over China have different traditions, but all gather to celebrate the Chinese New Year or the Spring Festival. “After this festival, Spring is coming and the spring is very important for Chinese people because when Spring comes people have to work. People come to work and farm the land. Spring means you need to plan ahead for the rest of the year. So it is very important,” stated Dong
The Lantern Festival is also a beautiful festival where people make Lanterns to Celebrate the Chinese New Year.
“Lantern means fire. It means brightness. And this light will dispel all darkness. It will expel the demons. It has a similarity to Sri Lankan culture where we worship the light. The light will expel the darkness and the devil. It symbolizes a bright future and a bright new year,” explained Dong.
The zodiac sign of the ‘Dog’ signifies the Chinese new year for 2018, where Chinese nationals all around the world celebrating this most important event of the Chinese lunar calendar. The Chinese nationals would call this year ‘The year of the Dog’ with wishes for prosperity, good health and happiness!
Rich traditions
Signifying the above, The China Cultural Fair is hosted for the 2nd time in Sri Lanka bringing the excitement and the cultural entertainment of China much closer to the Sri Lankan public who are now aware of the rich traditions of the Chinese culture.
This event is planned as a collection of programs where the visitors can enjoy the magnificent lanterns made by Chinese artists, street food organized by prominent Chinese restaurants in Colombo, and many other attractions.
“The youth in China also look forward to celebrating these festivals. Because when it comes to priorities, family comes first in the Chinese Culture. Now the young people have new ideas about celebrating the New Year. The young Chinese are independent but still, they want to come home to celebrate the New Year with their parents. So the home is very important. The family is sacred. These traditions are still respected in China,” pointed out Dong.
So these traditions are passed down from one generation to the next generation. It is the backbone of the Chinese people and has been for the last 4000 years.
“Spring marks a new beginning and a new start. A new chapter in life. It is all about working hard. Like Sri Lanka relatives visit each other and families get together. We welcome the gods and worship our ancestors. The Chinese culture places great emphasis on family, because if the family is peaceful and strong, then the entire society is strong.
The whole society will be peaceful. Then the whole country will be peaceful,” explained Dong.
