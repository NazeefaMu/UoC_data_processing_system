Inland fish production is inadequate – Harrison

Inland fish production should be increased to meet fish consumption since the per capita fish intake in the country is insufficient to cater to the nutritious level that the people need, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister P. Harrison said.
The Minister was speaking at a discussion held at his ministry on December 26. State Minister Dilip Wedaarachchi, Parliamentarians Hesha Withana, Chaminda Wijesiri and Ministry officials were present.
The Minister said the country has 27,000 waterways. The quantity of fish that people consume could be increased by catching more fish from the waterways. Although the country is surrounded by sea, we cannot increase the fish harvest because our maritime zone was very deep and not conducive for large scale fish breeding, he said.
The Minister said that health reports state that a person should consume at least 46 kg of fish annually, but the people, particularly those in the up country, eat only about 12 kg that is woefully inadequate.
The fisheries Ministry, therefore, has a great responsibility towards increasing fish production and making fish available at a fair price to consumers, he said. He said people today went for meat instead of fish because fresh fish was not easily available and the prices were much higher than that of meat.
The Minister requests ministry officials to expedite the programme to increase fish production.
He said that earlier the European embargo on the fish exports in the Rajapaksa regime deprived the country of an annual income of Rs. 16,000 million. The government elected in 2015 was able to reverse that trend and increased fish exports by 44 per cent. “We will further increase fish exports,” the Minister said.
