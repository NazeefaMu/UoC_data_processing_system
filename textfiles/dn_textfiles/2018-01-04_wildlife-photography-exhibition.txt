Wildlife photography exhibition

Nature photography and hand painting exhibition called ‘Silent’ showcasing the iconic portraits of wild animals in Sri Lanka taken by W.M.A Amal Darshana opens on January 5, 6 and 7 at the University of Visual and Performing Arts’ J.D.A. Perera Gallery.
Darshana is an employee of the People’s Bank’s Kiribathgoda branch. The photographer cum painter says that wildlife is an invaluable treasure that the country possesses.
“I have documented various forms of wildlife in their natural habitats. One can enjoy the beauty of nature by becoming a silent observer,” he said.
“In pursuit of the best shot of an animal, I had to be extremely patient and silent,” he said, “ If you get fed up and leave your hide, you are going to lose the opportunity of capturing that animal in your camera. (CW)
