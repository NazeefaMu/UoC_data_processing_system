Undergrads in worthy cause

The renovated Pamunuwa Sucharithodaya Niwasaya in Maharagama was opened recently.
It was renovated by the first-year undergraduates of the Management and Finance Faculty of the Colombo University under their community development project. The team ‘Amigos’ carried out car washes and food stalls to raise funds for the project.
The place was cleaned and painted by them.
Colombo University lecturers and the Sucharithodaya Niwasaya Manager were present at the event.
