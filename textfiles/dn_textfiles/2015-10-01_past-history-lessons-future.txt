UN Human Rights Council Resolution on Sri Lanka
Past history with lessons for the future

The consensus resolution on Sri Lanka at the 30th Session of the Human Rights Council sessions has several passages of note -
Emphasizing the importance of a comprehensive approach to dealing with the past incorporating the full range of judicial and non-judicial measures, individual prosecutions, reparations, truth-seeking, with a view to preventing the recurrence of violations and abuses; allowing for, in a manner consistent with its international obligations, the trial and punishment of those most responsible for the full range of crimes under the general principles of law recognized by the community of nations relevant to violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law (this refers to Article 13 (6), Paragraph 02 of the Constitution of Sri Lanka);
Encourages the Government of Sri Lanka to develop a comprehensive plan and mechanism for preserving all existing records and documentation relating to human rights violations and abuses and violations of international humanitarian law, whether held by public or private institutions.
It makes no reference to the 2009 Resolution at the Council. The importance of which is on that occasion it had reference to the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action Adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna on June 25,1993 with particular reference to para 1 and 3.The Vienna Declaration states, 'Reaffirming the commitment contained in Article 56 of the Charter of the United Nations to take joint and separate action, placing proper emphasis on developing effective international cooperation for the realization of the purposes set out in Article 55, including universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all.
My interpretation is that we had hence amongst others agreed in 2009 for the UN and GoSL to jointly and or separately act.
The National Human Rights Action Plan
The Government of Sri Lanka developed National Action Plan firstly, to respond to a call from our people to take stock of the human rights situation in Sri Lanka. Secondly, the National Action Plan was the Government's response to the recommendation of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted at the World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna, Austria in 1993. Following the pledge made at the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), the Government commenced the process of developing the Action Plan, through the then Ministry of Disaster Management and Human Rights as the focal agency for action. The National Action Plan was further revised and finalized following the focus group discussions in May 2011. A Cabinet Sub-Committee was to be set up to monitor the implementation of the Plan supported by a Monitoring Committee consisting of senior government officials from across the sectors.
A few select examples of the text within resonates with points which are in the recent UN HR.
Need for review of certain provisions in the Prevention of Terrorism Act in the light of internationally recognized human rights norms and standards which are obligatory on Sri Lanka;
Safety of suspects in custody-Amend Chapter 30 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to provide for Magistrates to: Conduct inquests into all deaths alleged to have been committed by the Police or the Security Forces;
Alleged violations of human rights which appear to be associated with the official location/assignment of certain officers attached to the Police/ security forces;
Alleged disappearances-Code of Criminal Procedure, and the Prevention of Terrorism Act Amended;
Implementation of the zero tolerance policy of the State on torture- Allegations of Torture in custody and places of detention;
Ensure the protection of all persons in custody/detention especially women and children-Conduct study of instances of sexual violence in custody/ detention during the last five years
Justification to look before 2002
The Law and Society Trust publication titled A LEGACY TO REMEMBER; SRI LANKA'S COMMISSIONS OF INQUIRY 1963 - 2002edited by Kishali Pinto-Jayawardena provides graphic details on the work of Commissions of Inquiry from the past. It includes Presidential Commission of Inquiry - incidents which took place between 13 August and 15th September, 1977 (Sansoni Commission, Kokkadicholai Incident, Disappearance of Persons in the Central, North Western, North Central and Uva Provinces, Disappearances of Persons in the Northern and Eastern Provinces, Disappearance of Persons in the Western, Southern and Sabaragamuwa Provinces, Involuntary Removal and Disappearances of Certain Persons (All Island); Presidential Truth Commission on Ethnic Violence(1981 - 1984). The Commission headed by Justice Paranagama has recently concluded its report.
The report of Census of the Missing and Loss of Property and Disabled of 2014 which together provide accurate householder narratives. ICRC shows 16, 137 in their Annual Report 2013 as the number of tracing requests from families of persons who went missing in connection with the conflict from 1990 until December 2013. The numbers and details with the UN working group on Disappearances and Summary executions need to be factored as well as the current UN HR. The toll to life amongst those who died from the LTTE and other militant groups is not recognized distinctly here.
Examples from some reports
Final Report Disappearance of Persons in the Central, North Western, North Central and Uva Provinces
SUMMARY OF FINDINGS:
Fifteen thousand and forty five complaints received, six thousand four hundred and forty three complaints were inquired into and eight thousand six hundred and two complaints were remaining at the conclusion of the Commission. The report includes names of some of those the Commission found to be credibly implicated in involuntary removals/disappearances whilst sending a confidential list under separate cover to the President.
According to the Commission: Most of the complainants do not seem to be interested in receiving compensation, as much as seeing those responsible being punished.... This is particularly so in the case of those complainants who had been involuntarily removed, tortured and released or escaped.... They came before this Commission in the hope that their torturers would be brought to book.
The Final Report cover prosecutions of responsible individuals, compensation without discrimination, scholarships for children of the disappeared, issuance of death certificates, relief for those who escaped death, and relief for those whose property was destroyed.
Final Report Disappearance of Persons in the Northern and Eastern provinces
A list of 48 names of those alleged to be responsible is included. According to the evidence recorded, ninety percent of the removals was ascribed to the security forces - Army, Navy, Air force and the Police. LTTE also was responsible for its own share of removals. Other militant groups also are in the picture. The Report asserts that "on exparte" evidence alone, it cannot decide on the guilt of these people. Hence, proper inquiries have to be undertaken and evidence given by the complainants should stand the scrutiny of cross-examination. 
Final Report(s) Disappearance of Persons Western, Southern and Sabaragamuwa Provinces,
The Final Report presents a comprehensive analysis, list of special witnesses summoned (organizations and persons), list of HCA cases where the Magistrate has made findings on responsibility, list of detention camps, a note on advisory bureaus in the UK, district wise breakdown of disappearances (1988 - 1990) on a monthly basis, addresses of complainants, and relationship between the disappeared and complainant. Seven thousand seven hundred and sixty one complaints were inquired into and five hundred and forty two remained at the conclusion of the Commission. The Commission found that seven thousand two hundred and thirty nine complaints were proved. It also notes the Distortion of the Investigations to conceal more than to reveal, and mechanically labeling as 'subversive act' without investigation, were some of the practices of avoidance used in the rare instances where the authorities could not refrain from semblance of an investigation.
An example of a cover up - The case of Richard de Soyza
R's corpse was discovered floating in the sea, with gun-shot injuries through the neck. At the inquest the Magistrate ordered the arrest of a senior police officer identified by R's mother to be one of the abductors of her son. The order was not carried out. On the day R's mother was due to give evidence on oath and be available for cross-examination by the several lawyers for the defense, the representative of the Attorney General stated that he would not be calling her as witness as her evidence was 'irrelevant'. The Magistrate accordingly terminated the proceedings. Files at the Attorney General's Department shows that the AG directed the Inspector-General of Police to 'hold further investigations'. There is no record of further investigations by the police/further directions by the AG. Subversion of justice through distortions in investigations was highlighted through an additional three cases - the Dambarella incident, the Mawarala incident, and the Dickwella incident. These cases are described to demonstrate that non-investigation of cases was "not isolated departures-from-practice or 'excesses.' They exemplify a generalized practice, which in its turn warrants the reasonable inference that this practice denotes a generalized direction NOT to investigate such incident (emphasis original)."
SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS:
The Southern Commission has one hundred and forty five recommendations categorized in eight sections: (1) relief measures; (2) women; (3) legal proceedings; (4) preventative measures; (5) Habeas Corpus applications; (6) emergency regulations; (7) excavation of mass graves; and (8) complaints remaining to be inquired into.
Operatives implementing the current resolution
The narratives show enormous good work undertaken credibly by domestic commissions. It also shows reason why we cannot begin in 2002. The application of Human Rights cannot suffer from selective amnesia. The abuses seem endemic and reflective of brutal conflicts within the country not confined to the North and East.
The narrative is a devastating indictment of thousands who have disappeared, subsequently aided and abetted by instances of torture and rape and (the text from the National Human Rights Action Plan is proof ) potentially isolated, individually inspired instances attracting international strictures. The impunity seen is the result of foul dissemination of knowledge and application on citizens across the country during times of insurrections.
Our efforts at truth telling and compassion have to be broader if recurrence is to be hopefully prevented. Examples domestic methods of organizing work are exhaustive whilst options for reparation and prosecutions comprehensive, methods of arriving at deductions are also found. Unfortunately our capacity to derail and or avoid prosecutions is also detailed. Given this history, read with passages of Resolutions at the Human Rights Council since 2009 international involvement walking with us in a sensitive manner is unavoidable.
