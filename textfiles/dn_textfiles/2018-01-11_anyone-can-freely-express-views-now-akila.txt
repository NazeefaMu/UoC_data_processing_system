Anyone can freely express views now - Akila

Today anyone can express any opinions without fear due to the change brought by the 'Yahapalana' government, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said.
"It is like a stage drama when corrupt politicians of the past regime distort the facts through the media. They enjoy the opportunity to talk freely today due to the change created by this government,” he added.
He further said that people who rode bicycles earlier are now billionaires. People who defaulted from bank loans earlier are now speaking like saints.
He said only the Court can decided who is guilty or who is not guilty. Several Ministers in the government have resigned from their posts even though they have not yet been found guilty by any Courts of law.
"The previous regime had many issues with regards to media freedom, especially murder of Lasantha Wickrematunge and attacks on many journalists like Poddala Jayantha. Since the Yahapalana government had assured drastic changes, we have not witnessed any incidents related
to any attacks, assassinations, abduction, threatening of journalists and setting fire to media institutions,” he said. However, that media has not given adequate publicity for the massive social and development transformations achieved by the 'Yahapalana' government during past three years.
Minister Kariyawasam was speaking on the occasion of the opening of the new office of the Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya (JSS), in the premises of the State Mortgage and Investment Bank in Kollupitiya.
He added that the State Mortgage and Investment Bank which was set up during the Donoughmore era is now occupying a leading role among Sri Lankan banks. The bank should further develop its branch network to provide efficient service for the people living in remote areas.
