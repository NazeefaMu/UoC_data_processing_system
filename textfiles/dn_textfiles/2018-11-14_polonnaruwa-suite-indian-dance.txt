Polonnaruwa, the suite of Indian dance

The Indian dance influence continuously impressed the sculptural concepts and decorative architectural sculptures of Sri Lanka which could be seen in different art forms including iconography and decorative architectural buildings. Following the Polonnaruwa period, numerous other periods existed in the Sri Lankan history.
The dance impact on sculptures could be obviously seen in the post-Polonnaruwa period building decorations and sculptures especially in the periods of Dambadeniya, Kurunegala, Yapahuwa, Gampola, Raigama, Seethawaka, Kotte, Kandy and Colombo. Among the above mentioned period, Yapahuwa period is considered important for this study because numerous Indian dance related sculptures are seen in the Yapahuwa period.
Ancient glory
Yapahuwa is situated in the Kurunegala district of Sri Lanka. Further, it is located nearly three miles east of Maho. The earlier glory of this ancient citadel could be found at one of the caves and boulder.
This is visibly seen from a short record in Brahmi script. It is stated that Brahmi language was in use from the period of 3rd century B.C to 3rd century A.D. Yapahuwa gained prominence after the first half of the 13th century AD, especially after the Kalinga marauder Magha devastated the capital Polonnaruwa. Kalinga Magha’s period was from 1214 to 1235. Earlier Yapahuwa was known as Subha –Pabbata. Subha –Pabbata means (Subha Mountain).
According to history, during the reign of Vijayabahu 1V (1271-1273A.C) the place was called Sundarapabbata. According to historical evidence, the king Vijayabahu IV commanded his younger brother Bhuvanekabahu to settle there with his strong army to prevent the South Indian invasion. Despite his heavy guard, the attack came from another direction led by Chandrabhanu in co-operation with his Pandya and Chola allies.
Yet numerous historical records reveal Yapahuwa had a long history. In the 16th century history, the Portuguese have mentioned Yapahuwa as the fortress of Sinhalese. The first study of Yapahuwa was done by the civil servant John Bailey in 1850. In 1864 John Bailey published an article on Yapahuwa under the title once a week. On 5th of May 1877, an architect from Anuradhapura mentioned Yapahuwa to Governor W.H Gregory, by indicating that more attention should be paid to it.
Yapahuwa fortification
Again fifteen years later, the Ceylon branch of the Royal Asiatic Society published two articles, one by F.H. Modder and the other by J. Harward under the title ‘Note on the Fortifications of Yapahuwa’. Yapahuwa is totally a stone structure. The stone structure has a staircase which is flanked and decorated by two furious stone made lions with attractive porch set against the famed Yapahuwa rock. Till today it is as considered one of the finest ancient archaeological constructions of Sri Lanka during the post-Polonnaruwa period.
The Archaeological Department commenced operations in 1911, H.C. Bell took great interest and pain to protect the monument from destruction and collapse. Today Yapahuwa provides ample evidence for carved ancient sculptures of Sri Lanka. Excellent carved sculptures are seen all over.
Beautiful dance figures are well carved in Yapahuwa. The carved figures including dancing girls, lions, swans and large lion elephants are seen at Yapahuwa. And also it provides an opportunity to compare these dance figures with the poses of Indian classical dances especially with the dancing figures of Chidambaram temple (Chola period dances of Chidambaram temple sculptures).
It resembles the South Indian Cholas sculptures (period sculptures are famous for stone sculptures and stone carving sculptures) and Chola architectural sculptures. However, there is no doubt that it was further modified according to the Sinhalese architecture style and excellent unique Sinhalese craftsmanship. Beautifully carved dancing figures are seen at the staircase.
Female figures
Even Kirti Mukha head of a mythical creature and a pair of Gaja Sinha are seen there. The base of the porch area is decorated with beautiful female figures and male dancing figures. These dancing figures depict numerous dance poses. These carved figures are not only depicting the dance poses but also depict numerous instrumental accompaniments for dance. It implies that during the period dances took place with instrumental music.
It provides an opportunity for us to assume that dancing carved figures reveal some dance procession scene. Actually, the staircase could be divided into three different sections. At the third level, beautiful slender female figures are seen. No doubt the stairways which lead to the porch are well preserved. At both sides, exquisite and excellent craftwork windows were seen.
Such excellent windows are not seen elsewhere in the Lankan archaeological sites. The window in the west was removed a few years back and it was stated that it was brought down to the Colombo Museum. The other was a small fragment window which was taken to one of the Yapahuwa temples.
The size of the window was fitted into a thick outer frame. Within the moulded window, forty-five cut circles were crafted. These cut circles were joined with one another. Within the circles, a variety of figure works was crafted with meticulous care. Different dance figures of dancers were seen.
Lotus figure
Most of these dance figures are seen in typical Bharatha Natya Arimandi Istana position. All the dance poses are seen with a proper and perfect geometrical format position. The centre of this window circle carries a lotus figure. At the sides of the centre lotus circle, four wheels are seen with eight strokes and some circles are decorated with dancing figures. Hence for the dance research, Yapahuwa provides a great deal of information for the researcher.
Following Yapahuwa numerous beautiful dance sculptures and beautiful dance depicted in the stone friezes with typical Karana dance impact could be seen in the sculptures of the Gampola period, Kotte period and Kandyan period.
