International Maritime Conference at Galle Face Hotel on October 9 and 10

"Galle Dialogue", the International Maritime Conference organised by the Sri Lanka Navy for the 8th consecutive year is scheduled to be held at the Galle Face Hotel in Colombo.
The Conference will be held on October 9 and 10 with the participation of the Navy Commanders of the other countries and a large turnout of representatives from 38 countries under the ‘Greater Maritime Visibility for Enhanced Maritime Security’ .
The Navy Media Unit said it was a major challenge today keeping the maritime sphere safe and secure since vast oceans were vulnerable to be utilized by criminals for nefarious activities due to blindness and lack of or sympathetic legal regimes to deal with wrongdoer.
The Unit said that the rapid evolution of maritime security threats and challenges demand a proactive response from the key players who have the responsibility of keeping the oceans safe and secure. As we all act as nodes of a web that is laid over the maritime domain, the role played by stakeholders in protecting the maritime sphere from a wider range of threats is therefore considered crucial.
Though, there are quite a number of agencies that are involved in ensuring maritime security and managing their own affairs/ back yards such as Merchant Vessel traffic, smuggling trails of humans and drugs, and IUU fishing, human trafficking, each of them has their capabilities and capacities focused on different sectors to acquire visibility only in their interested sectors. Therefore, one of the significant challenges that we face today is to explore how best each one of us can work in unison to share the ‘own visible maritime segment’ with rest of us to minimize ‘Maritime Blindness’.
Navy Media Unit said it was in this context that this year’s Galle Dialogue theme ‘Greater Maritime Visibility for Enhanced Maritime Security’ has been articulated to pave the way to enhance ‘maritime visibility’ and address maritime security threats and challenges through a proactive stratagem.
