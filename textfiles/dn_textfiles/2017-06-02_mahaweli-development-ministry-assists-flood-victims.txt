Institutions coming under the purview of the Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry on the instructions of President Maithripala Sirisena have distributed assistance worth Rs 10 million among people distressed by the recent natural disaster.
A team of 2,000 persons will be deployed for cleaning up activities in the Kalutara district on June 5, which marks World Environment Day, Mahaweli Development and Environment Deputy Minister Anuradha Jayaratne said.
