Avurudu celebrations at British School

The British School in Colombo celebrated Avurudu with the traditional rites and rituals of the Sinhala and Tamil New Year during a Special Assembly held at the school premises under the patronage of Principal Dr. John Scarth.
The Avurudu season was welcomed with characteristic colour, song and dance while signifying the meanings of the customs and traditions by members of all Key Stages in the Senior School.
The Avurudu celebrations also featured traditional song and dance performances from the talented performers of both the Junior and Senior Schools.
In addition, teachers and students were invited to attend school in Sri Lankan National costume, and among the traditional rituals celebrated was the boiling of the milk and the tradition of Ganu-Denu.
Overall, the Avurudu celebrations at the British School turned out to be a unique event as students and teachers from all over the world gathered to celebrate the traditions and customs unique to the remarkable Island Nation, Sri Lanka.
