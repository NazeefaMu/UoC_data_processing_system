Coconuts more precious than son?

A father, residing at Paradise village, went to the Ratnapura town recently with his little son to get the lad a haircut and purchase some home needs.
When he came to the bus stand to take the bus home, he had seen a batta lorry unloading coconuts at shops in the area at wholesale price and thought of making a bargain by buying some coconuts for his household. He thereafter boarded a bus to get back home with his son, taking a gunny bag full of coconuts, as well as other provisions. After getting down at his destination with his bag full of provisions, he realised that the bus had taken off with his son aboard. The father who was in a state of panic abandoned his goods and soon boarded a three wheeler to chase after the bus.
After overtaking the bus, when it stopped at the Kuruwita halt, he boarded it and fetched his son who was seen playing with a toy quite unaware of what had happened. When he returned he saw the bag full of provisions intact at the spot he left it and collected it too on his way.
Bystanders who watched the scene in amusement were heard saying “given the high price of coconuts today, it is no wonder that he treasured and clung onto his provisions, even momentarily forgetting his son”.
