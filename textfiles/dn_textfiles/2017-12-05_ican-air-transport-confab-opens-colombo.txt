ICAN air transport confab opens in Colombo

The 10th ICAN (ICAO Air Services Management Negotiation Event) conference began in Colombo yesterday and will conclude on November 8 at the Hilton Colombo.
Around 500 delegates from more than 75 states are participating in this event. The conference also will provide Sri Lanka the opportunity to meet nearly 30 states with a view of liberalizing air services agreements and expanding the existing provisions.
Chief Guest, Minister of Transport and Civil AviationNimal Siripala de Silva, said thatair travel which was considered a luxury in the past have become an indispensable mode of travel for promotion of commerce, trade and travel. “It is fast becoming affordable to a greater section of the average community.”
“We know that a strong and affordable global air transport network goes beyond continents, greatly expands local access to foreign supplies and markets, provides invaluable opportunities for cultural and social exchange and enhances emergency and humanitarian response capabilities during crises and public health emergencies.”
“Air transport has over the past few years shown a prominent and promising growth both in terms of demand and supply in capacity. Since of late, the global airline industry has started making positive financial results, whilst consumers are continuing to enjoy lowering air fares.”
“It is inspiring to note that amidst growing traffic, the air transport sector has been able to maintain an impressive safety record thanks to tireless efforts and work done by all involved. As per ICAO statistics this year there have been only three accidents resulting in 47 fatalities. It is a significant achievement compared to past consecutive years.”
