Hizbullah urges UN to resolve Syrian crisis

Resettlement and Rehabilitation State Minister M. L. A. M. Hizbullah sent an official letter to United Nations (UN) Secretariat Resident Coordinator in Colombo Nina Brandstrup on Wednesday, urging the UN to take immediate steps to resolve the current crisis in Syria.
In his letter, Hisbullah said:
"In the name of Allah, I urge all concerned parties to prevent the current carnage in Syria. I also appeal to all Muslim countries, to take immediate action with the coordination of the UN Assembly. It is necessary to hold a ceasefire."
"By the UN Secretary General's statement that at present, Syria is hell on earth, we can only imagine the situation there. During the past week, it was reported that more than 600 civilians were killed. Thousands of women and children were massacred in the internal war. Parties responsible should end the needless bloodshed of innocent people. It is time to come to a mutual understanding."
"The UN has to consider this situation as a serious and urgent matter, at the currently ongoing Human Rights Commission’s session. The Human Rights Commission has a responsibility to bring about a ceasefire among the relevant parties. "On behalf of all Sri Lankan Muslims, I condemn the ongoing onslaught and appeal to the UN and the world to support Syria in this time of need."
