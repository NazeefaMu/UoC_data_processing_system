Death wish  remake gets a retro poster

A new poster for Eli Roth's upcoming ‘Death Wish’ remake has been revealed.
The poster has a retro grindhouse aesthetic and declares the film's main star, Bruce Willis, is back.
Death Wish hits theaters on March 2 after initially being delayed. It's a remake of the 1974 film of the same name starring Charles Bronson. Roth directs from a script by Joe Carnahan (The Grey, Narc). Along with Willis, the movie stars Vincent D'Onofrio, Dean Norris, Elisabeth Shue, Camila Morrone, and Kimberly Elise.
