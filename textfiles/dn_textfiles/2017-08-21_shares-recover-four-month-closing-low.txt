Point of view
Share markets fell for the 5th consecutive week, losing ~56 points W-o-W to close at 6436.28 points amid low retail participation and mixed Q2’17 corporate results.
Markets which lost ~85 points during the start of the week, closed at a 4-month low on Thursday, but reversed its losing streak on Friday to add ~28 points which helped wipe-off some of the week’s early losses.
Nevertheless, the negative sentiment that has pre-dominated markets over the past five weeks continued to dampen actitivty, resulting in the Benchmark ASPI losing ~330 points over this 5-week period and dragging the Y-T-D returns on the Index to 3.3% (cf. 8.6% recorded five weeks ago).
Average turnover levels for the week however amounted to LKR 0.65Bn, ~45% higher than last week’s average of LKR 0.45Bn amid greater Institutional, HNI & Foreign participation. Crossings for the week consequently accounted to 49% of total market turnover, with large parcels traded in HNB (44% of crossings), Sampath (32% of crossings) and JKH (16% of crossings).
Net foreign flows too improved to LKR 0.98Bn, 394% higher than last week as foreigners continued to support equity markets for the 29th consecutive week.
Markets in the week ahead are likely to look for cues from the Inland Revenue Bill which is expected to be passed by Parliament next Friday (Aug 25th).
June quarter earnings mixed
Corporate earnings over the June’17 quarter have been mixed, with ~54% of the 214 companies that have reported thus far recording Y-o-Y gains.
Earnings of the approx. 75% of corporates who have reported so far has totaled LKR 36Bn compared to the LKR 50Bn reported by all corporates in June’16 and relative to LKR76Bn reported (by total market) in the March’17 quarter.
Compared to last year (June 16) when ~76% of the market reported total earnings of LKR40Bn, the June 17 results of the 75% of corporates who have reported so far has fallen marginally to LKR36 Bn reflecting the pressures on the economy from the drought and flood impact earlier this year.
Sri Lanka’s new Inland Revenue bill meanwhile is to be presented next week and is expected to be passed by end-week1, with the Finance Ministry adding that many of the concerns raised by both the private sector and all the concerns raised by the Supreme court having been addressed.
The Finance Ministry also announced the removal of the 10% telecom data levy, while revising import levies on vehicles such as motorcycles, single cabs and mini trucks, adding that these measures along with several credit schemes targeting SMEs and exporters were aimed at promoting job growth and entrepreneurship.
