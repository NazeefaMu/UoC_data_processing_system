Jaffna’s Tellippalai Base Hospital gets new medical equipment

Under reconciliation intervention programme of the National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry, the Tellippalai Base Hospital in Jaffna District was strengthened with modern medical equipment to the value of Rs.70 Million, said V. Sivagnanasothy National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry Secretary.
The base hospital capacity was strengthened in surgery unit, maternal health unit, baby care unit, cancer unit and Anesthesia unit. This will not only benefit Jaffna district but entire Northern Province. A large number of patients go to Southern private hospital and neighboring countries such as India to undergo surgery, testing and medical treatment. However, the low income groups who are below the poverty line experienced difficulties due to affordability issues and reconciliation initiatives on capacity building of base hospital will significantly contribute to improve access to quality health services free of charge.
Under the Ministry initiative the medical equipment such as video Laparoscopy, Ultra Sound Scanner, Colonoscopy, hysteroscopy, high pressure stream sterilizer, electro surgical and patient warming, patient monitor, 630 ATYS system, incubator, warmer, intrusion pump, plus oxymeter, 300 KVA generator have been provided to the Tellippalai base hospital. This intervention also helps to accelerate the resettlement on a fast track basis.
Further, the Ministry has also supported to construct the cancer homes in Tellippalai which will enable the cancer patients in the Northern Province to obtain treatment by staying in these homes said Sivagnanasothy.
The equipment were handed over by the National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry Secretary V. Sivagnanasothy and District Secretary, Jaffna N.Vethanayahan. The Director Dr.Thivarhar, Medical Specialists and Consultants including Nursing Staff also participated in the handing over ceremony that was held on February 1, 2018.
