Landslide threat in Dimbula

A landslide threat at the Dimbula Unifield Group has prompted the estate management to evacuate plantation workers living in 19 line rooms numbering around 60 to a safer location.
Dimbula police said a minor earthslip had occurred on the hillock behind the line rooms around 2 am yesterday (May 30). Walls in another 15 houses nearby had cracked due to this earthslip and steps have been taken to evacuate the worker families living in them too.
