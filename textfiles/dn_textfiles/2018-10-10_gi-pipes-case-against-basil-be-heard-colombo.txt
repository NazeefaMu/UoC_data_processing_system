GI pipes case against Basil to be heard in Colombo

The Colombo High Court yesterday decided not to transfer the GI pipes case to the Homagama High Court.
Accordingly, the case filed against former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa and former Director General of Divi Neguma Department, Kithsiri Ranawaka for allegedly misappropriating Rs.36.5 million of funds belonging to the Divi Neguma Department to purchase GI pipes was yesterday fixed for trial, to be heard on January 16, 2109, before the Colombo High Court.
On a previous occasion, the Attorney General was directed to inform court in writing whether this case will be transferred to the Homagama High Court over a jurisdiction issue.
Senior State Counsel Asad Navavi appearing for the Attorney General submitted to Court that the alleged offence had been taken place at the Divi Neguma head office in Colombo 8 and thereby this court has jurisdiction to hear the matter. However, the magisterial inquiry into the case was held at the Kaduwela Magistrate’s Court which comes under the Homagama High Court’s jurisdiction.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against the former Minister and the former Director General of the Divi Neguma Department in the Colombo High Court for allegedly misappropriating Rs.36.5 million funds belonging to the Divi Neguma Development Department to purchase and distribute GI pipes during the last Presidential Election.
The AG maintained that the act of the accused deems guilt of the offence of bribery in accordance with Section 79 of the Presidential Election Act No 15 of 1981.
Furthermore, the two accused had been charged under the Public Property Act No. 12 of 1982 to file misappropriation charges.
Senior State Counsel Asad Navavi appeared for the Attorney General. President’s Counsel Jayantha Weerasinghe appeared for the accused.
