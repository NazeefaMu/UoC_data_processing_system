Six jumbo deaths in Galgamuwa

Two wild elephants died on November 20 after being knocked down by the Colombo Kankesanthurai mail train at Meegashandiya, bringing the total number of elephant deaths in the Galgamuwa wildlife circuit in recent times to six, a spokesman for the Galgamuwa wildlife office said.
Apart from the two elephants who died on November 20, another elephant out of the six mentioned was also knocked down by a train while a baby elephant died at birth. Out of the balance two, one died of injuries caused by a ‘Hakka Patas’ explosion and the other died of gunshot wounds caused by a poacher.
Meanwhile, residents expressed dismay at the failure of authorities to implement a practical programme to prevent such elephant deaths.
