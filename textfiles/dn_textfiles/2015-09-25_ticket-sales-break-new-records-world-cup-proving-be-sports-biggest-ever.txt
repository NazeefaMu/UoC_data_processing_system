Ticket sales break new records with World Cup proving to be the sport's biggest ever

Rugby World Cup ticket sales hit a record 2.35million on Wednesday night to further England 2015's claims that this year's tournament is already the sport's biggest ever.
Just six days after kick-off at Twickenham in the opener between England and Fiji last week, this Rugby World Cup is already outstripping every previous edition in almost every quantifiable way.
Only four per cent of the total tickets remain on sale, with 100,000 more sold than the previous record-breaking tournament in France eight years ago, while corporate sales have even outstripped the London 2012 Olympics.
Among the other records broken include the one for a World Cup attendance, smashed by the 89,019 who turned out to watch New Zealand vs Argentina at Wembley on Sunday, television viewing figures and commercial revenues.
ITV's coverage push has seen ratings-leader the X Factor moved to accommodate rugby's Saturday night game, with audiences of 10-15m expected, and more records will be broken when international figures are analysed.
Just 14 of the remaining matches having tickets left available, and only one of those is ranked as having more than 'limited availability' in the higher price categories by tournament organisers.
Corporate packages for the final next month, priced from £2,495 per person, remain on sale but will certainly sell out to boost the tournament's overall turnover to more than £100m after corporate sales exceeded those for the London Olympics by 50 per cent.
However, fans are still unhappy with pricing levels surrounding the matches across the country. The most expensive tickets are still available for many games, while pints of Heineken at stadiums and in the Fan Zones are priced at £5.
Matchday programmes for each fixture cost £10 and the average ticket is sold at £104.17. DAILY MAIL
