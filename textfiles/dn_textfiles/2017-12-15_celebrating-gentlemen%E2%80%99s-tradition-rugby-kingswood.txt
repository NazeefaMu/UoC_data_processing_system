Celebrating the Gentlemen’s Tradition of rugby at Kingswood

Kingswood College Kandy was the first school to play the oval shape ball and has a proud rugby history.
A product of Trinity College Kandy E.L.Blaze introduced rugby in 1893 to Kingswood. The first school’s game was played in 1906 between Kingswood and Trinity which ended in a 6-all draw. Kingswood gave up the game after a few years when a player died after an attack off a kick.
There was no rugby at Kingswood in the 1920s, 1930s, 1940s and 1950s. The game was reintroduced in 1967 with an under 17 team.
Inspired by the 1968 rugby batch, Old Kingswoodians Rugby Club has come forward to organise a unique event to celebrate the Gentlemen’s Tradition of Rugby at Kingswood.
The event takes place on Sunday 17 December, starting 6.30 pm at the P. Sara Oval.
The organisers will felicitate the 1968 rugby team on their Golden Jubilee, all principals who served Kingswood from 1968-2017, all captains for the last 50 years and all Kingswoodians who went onto represent Sri Lanka.
The guests of honour at the occasion will be all past principals, president of the Sri Lanka Schools Rugby Football Association and CEO of Sri Lanka Rugby.
It will be a grand and unique occasion bringing together young and old Kingswoodians and well-wishers with their spouses from five generations into an evening of good spirit and camaraderie.
Tickets priced at Rs.2000 per head are available with Lasitha 0777303532, Chamu 0773524174 and with Old Kingswoodians Rugby Club.
