Shelter for all by 2025 under the Yahapalanaya regime

Out of a total of 6 million families in Sri Lanka, 2.5 million families have various housing issues while the ‘Yahapalanaya’ regime succeeded in fulfilling the housing needs of 220,636 families during a period of two years, Housing and Constructions Minister Sajith Premadasa said.
The Minister said that the Housing and Construction Ministry and other affiliated organisations would execute the ultimate goal of providing a shelter to every citizen by 2025.
Speaking at a media briefing at the Sirikotha, United National Party Headquarters yesterday, he said the previous regime was very inefficient and wasted the country’s funds on unfruitful projects without even satisfying the basic needs of the general public. The previous Government neglected to maintain an accurate set of statistics on the housing issues and needs of the country and they were manipulating the statistics according to their own will, the minister added.
Premadasa said the Housing and Constructions Ministry had carried out a census on the housing needs of the country and it would be released on June 23, on the National Housing Day under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena.
He said, “According to the census, it was identified that 3,650 families of war heroes do not have a permanent shelter. The previous regime was only focused on implementing unproductive projects such as establishing the Hambanthota port and the airport without giving priority to the war heroes who fought against terrorism to achieve freedom. The ‘Yahapalanaya’ regime will satisfy the housing needs of the 3,650 war heroes’ families by 2020.”
Premadasa further said that 511,000 families had been identified with no access to clean water and 200,000 families are identified to be having serious issues with sanitary facilities while over 278,000 families had been residing in temporary shelters and over 300,000 people had been identified with no proper shelter, according to the census.
The Minister said that construction of 420 ‘Uda Gammana’ Model Villages were in progress and the present regime would execute it with the aim of constructing 500 ‘Uda Gammana’ Model Villages by the end of 2017. The ultimate goal of the Government will be to construct 2,000 model villages by 2020 to satisfy the housing needs of the general public, he added.
Premadasa also said that several housing projects including the Scattered Housing programme, Northern Housing Project, Housing programme for kidney patients, Special Housing Programme in Bogaswewa and Batticaloa, ‘Grama Shakthi’ Programme, Housing programme for youth between the ages of 18 and 35 and Housing programme for artists at regional level had been implemented and would be executed by the ‘Yahapalanaya’ regime.
“A housing programme for journalists will also be implemented jointly with the aid of the Lands and Parliamentary Reforms Minister Gayantha Karunathilake," he added.
The Minister further said that housing programmes for mid income earners had been implemented in Wadduwa, Ragama, Athurugiriya and Homagama.
