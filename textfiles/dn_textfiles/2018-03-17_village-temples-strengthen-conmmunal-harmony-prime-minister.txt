Village temples strengthen conmmunal harmony Prime Minister

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who attended the opening of the Gold plated fence, Bodhi Prakaraya and Bell Tower at the Damunupola Sri Anandarama Viharasthanaya in Kegalle recently, observed the need to strengthen the village temple to ensure communal harmony.
Thanking Jagath Karunaratne and his family for their generous donations for the temple, he stated that he agreed with the sermon of the Chief Incumbent in the sense that it was through the village temple that Buddhism has been protected in the country for so long.
Despite the presence of large Buddhist temples around the country, everyone eventually comes to the village temple. If the temple has strong benefactors, they support the temple and its monk. It is a strength to the village then. Even if the people are divided politically or any other way in the village, they can all come together to work through the TempleDayaka Sabha. We have to protect that strength, the Prime Minister said.
“We need to create an environment where as Sinhala Buddhists, we can work together. And in a majority Sinhala Buddhist country, we need to work to win the confidence of other religious groups. When that confidence and faith between communities break, the country falls apart. So we need to always protect that trust,” he said.
"Last week, Kandy, Digana, and Teldeniya experienced tense situations. We need to rebuild trust in those communities," the Premier said.. "We had a 30-year war in our country. As a result we were left behind. Now we need to focus on how we can bring development to the village," he said.
“The first two years of this government has been very tough. We spent most of our time firefighting and repaying debt. So the people ran out of patience, and we saw the consequences of that at the recently concluded Local Government Elections. They voted against us because we were unable to deliver on many of what was promised whilst other promises took a long time to bear fruition. Cost of living rose higher than what we expected and there was a fertilizer shortage. The shortcomings cost the government a heavy price. As a government, we now have to work according to the will of the people and go forward according to what they ask of us,” the Prime Minister said.
"Politics is not just a tug of war between a few groups. We need to understand that it is also working for the betterment of the people. We have to correct our mistakes and move forward," he said.
"A month after the election, we had to face tensions in Kandy. We now have to bring the situation under control and move ahead," the Prime Minister said.
“By the Sinhalese New Year, we need to have the goods the people need in the country. They need to have money in hand. After the New Year, we have planned to start several programmes with foreign investors to many jobs in the country. We will start factories, hotels and ports and various other projects. They should bear fruit in the next 2-3 years. By 2020, we will see results,” the Premier said.
