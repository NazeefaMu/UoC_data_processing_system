AmCham presents white paper on FDIs to US Embassy

A white paper on FDIs into Sri Lanka was presented by AmCham in April 2018 to the US Embassy said, AmCham President Dr Kumudu Gunesekera.
Speaking at a networking event in Colombo last week he said that this would also help to create awareness of investment opportunities available in Sri Lanka to US enterprises.

New mission director for USAID in Sri Lanka Reed Aeschliman too participated at the event.
State Minister of Defense, Ruwan Wijewardene speaking on defense relationships Sri Lanka has with the US said, after 1985 an aircraft career that came to Sri Lanka recently contributed towards pumping 1.5 billion rupees revenue into the Lankan economy.
“The aircraft career got thousands of sailors coming ashore and lavishly spending their money here”, he said. The minister was speaking at the American Chamber of Commerce’s (AmCham) bimonthly networking event held at Park Street Mews, Colombo.
“Sri Lanka’s Relationships with the US has grown tremendously. We are happy to have their inputs, advice on the reconciliation process,” he said.
“US help us build our naval capabilities too. They offered us a Coast Guard Cutter that will help our Navy to patrol our economic zone as well as our coastline.
“We have much of the container lines going between the east and the west. Hence countries like China, India, USA, UK, France, are eager to harness relationships with Sri Lanka. They help us secure the international trade lines and communication which go via the Southern tip of our country” he added.
New mission director for USAID in Sri Lanka Reed Aeschliman too participated in the event.
