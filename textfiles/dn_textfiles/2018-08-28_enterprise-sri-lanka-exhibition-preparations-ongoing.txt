Enterprise Sri Lanka exhibition preparations ongoing

The Enterprise Sri Lanka exhibition, under the theme ‘From patriotic rebellion to development struggle,’ will be held in Moneragala from August 29 to 31.
It will showcase Sri Lanka’s journey towards development based on democracy and reconciliation.
The programme will be another stage of the government’s ambitious programme to create entrepreneurs.
The three-day exhibition includes 12 zones and 515 stalls organised by the government, semi-government and private sector to raise awareness among the public on subsidized loan schemes etc.
The programme will also enlighten the public on the government’s recently launched development programmes such as Gamperaliya and Gramashakthi as a part of the government’s economic development policy programme – Vision 2025.
Moneragala District Secretary D. S. Pathmakulasuriya told the Daily News that steps were taken to provide facilities to the public who visit the exhibition during the three days.
