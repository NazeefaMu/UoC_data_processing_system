ESET celebrates consumer loyalty with promotion

DCS International Private Limited (DCS), the exclusive authorized distributor of ESET in Sri Lanka, recently launched their “Virus Delete KarannaThegi Win Karanna” promotion to thank their customers for years of loyalty. This unique promotion, which will be conducted in partnership with ESET’s brand ambassador Kumar Sangakarra, will reward every person who purchases an ESET Internet Security Package.
The promotion will give away several mega prizes including card readers, wireless mouse, selfie sticks, USB hubs, hands free sets and more. As an added bonus the prizes will also include items autographed by Kumar Sangakkara such as photos, calendars and more.
“This promotion is our way of giving back to a community that has embraced us and come to trust us. Two decades of operations have thought us a lot and the most important lesson is that the customer is at the center of everything we do. This is why we are rewarding everyone without the need for a scratch card or raffle draw,” said DilrukWeerasinghe, Sales Manager – ESET retail at DCS International Private Limited.
The promotion also coincides with the launch of the latest version of ESET Internet Security in Sri Lanka. Offering the best mix of detection, speed and usability, this version of ESET Internet Security comes with many proven features.
“Bundling the promotion with the ESET Internet Security package seemed logical to us as increasing numbers of Sri Lankans access the world of information and services over the internet hence data protection becomes a real concern.As online threats get more and more diverse, users need more complex internet security suites which provide added layers of protection.
The latest edition of ESET Internet Security is geared to offer optimal protection from these threats and our promotion is simply an added perk to purchasing an item that is integral to their security,” Dilruk added.
Since 1987, ESET® has been developing award-winning security software that now helps over 100 million users to Enjoy Safer Technology. Being exclusively distributed in Sri Lanka by DCS International Private Limited since 2010, ESET provides outstanding country-specific cyber security coverage as well as alerts on threats specific to the market to ensure that Sri Lankan businesses and consumers can stay safe from online threats.
