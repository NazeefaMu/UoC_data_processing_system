Feeder service between Colombo and Bangladesh soon - Yamuna Wettasinghe

A feeder service between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh would commence soon, said Assistant General Manager of Ceylon Shipping Corporation Ltd, Yamuna Wettasinghe speaking to Daily News Biz Shipping.
“During the state visit of President Maithripala Sirisena last July, a MoU between Ceylon Shipping Corporation and Bangladesh Shipping Corporation was signed to operate a feeder service between Colombo and Chittagong. To commence this project, we will join with a partner on public-private partnership (PPP) basis, who can deploy vessels for this feeder sector,” she said.
“We are planning to resume the passenger ferry service between Colombo and Tuticorin soon.
This service facilitates passenger movements as well as cargo movements and vehicles between Sri Lanka and India. CSC intends to work with a suitable and experienced partner to operate this cargo cum passenger service between Colombo and Tuticorin,” she said.
“We are conducting maritime training facilities for Sri Lankan cadets on our own two ships (Ceylon Breeze and Ceylon Princess) as well as on third party vessels. We do have a cadet training berth in our vessels which can accommodate 26 cadets at a given time.
These two ships can provide training facilities for 52 cadets. CSC intends to increase cadet training opportunities to Sri Lankan youth in terms of expanding its fleet of vessels at a right time in untapped business areas appropriately,” she said.
“Shipping is not only the transport of goods or passengers by sea. It covers vast areas. Ceylon Shipping Corporation is the national carrier of Sri Lanka and our scope is to purchase, build, charter and hire vessels and also to engage in other shipping related businesses, “she added.
