Why Dallas needed a new animal cruelty plan

After Dallas firefighters extinguished a suspected house arson earlier this year, a malnourished pit bull with a brown and white face lay at their feet in a silent plea for mercy.
Her throat had been slit.
Firefighters surmised that whoever lit the house on fire was also responsible for the gaping, bloody wound across her neck.
They reported the throat-slashing and saved the dog, which they named Khaleesi after a Game of Thrones character. But the city has no idea how often this happens: Officials stumbling upon a case of animal cruelty during the course of their regular work.
Dallas will announce a plan to change that, as part of a broader effort to tackle the city’s urgent loose and dumped dog problems.
Here are five things to know ahead of time:
1. Dallas has a pack of dog problems.
Loose dogs. Dead dogs. Abused dogs.
Dallas has myriad competing problems when it comes to animal services.
Hundreds of loose dogs roam parts of southern Dallas, while one particular area — rural Dowdy Ferry Road in the city’s southeast — has become a dumping ground for animals, dead and alive.
Officials hope cracking down on animal cruelty can help with the other issues, too.
“It all works together,” said Kris Sweckard, director of code compliance.
2. One group will oversee animal cruelty cases.
A new group, which includes police, prosecutors and animal services workers, will be tasked with improving how the city reports and investigates animal cruelty cases, said assistant city manager Joey Zapata.
He hopes improved coordination will help Dallas track cases like Khaleesi’s, in which city officials come across instances of cruelty while performing other duties, such as responding to fires or domestic violence calls. That number could then be added to the nearly 4,000 animal cruelty calls the city gets each year.
3. Activists are raising a toast, but holding off on the good champagne.
Animal activists have been pushing Dallas to do more to address cruelty, loose dog and dog dumping issues for a while. This new group represents a major move in that direction because it assigns responsibility to specific people, said advocate Stephanie Timko.
“The group will shine a light on a lot of the broken processes — or the lack of processes — that are in place for dealing with animal abuse,” she said.
But she said the way Dallas handles animal cruelty “needs to be, from the bottom up, completely redone.” Ideally, she’d like the Dallas police to create a specialized animal cruelty unit.
4. Former Texas Ranger Pudge Rodriguez is on board.
Also on Monday, city officials announced a “Show Your Soft Side” campaign. The effort, which originated in Baltimore, uses sports celebrities to persuade young people that torturing defenseless animals isn’t manly. It’s similar to what Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings did to combat domestic violence in 2013, when he launched ads saying real men don’t hit women.
Participants include former Texas Ranger Ivan “Pudge” Rodriguez, Dallas Cowboys Zack Martin and Tyrone Crawford, 105.3 FM The Fan host Skin Wade, MMA fighter Justin Miller and FC Dallas forward Tesho Akindele.
5. Khaleesi is still looking for a home.
The pit bull firefighters found with her throat slashed is available for adoption through DFW Rescue Me.
The rescue group says the 3-year-old “will follow you from room to room and loves belly rubs.” “For a dog with such a traumatic past,” it says, “she just wants to give and receive love.” Dallas News
