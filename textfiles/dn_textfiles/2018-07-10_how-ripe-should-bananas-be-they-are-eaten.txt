How ripe should bananas be before they are eaten?

A massive debate is raging on social media over this seemingly ordinary question: how ripe should bananas be before they are eaten?
Some refuse to eat the tropical yellow fruit if there is even hint of green showing through, while anyone who has binned a bruised banana will attest that there is such thing as being too ripe.
A widely-shared Instagram snap from the fitness meals account has asked its 2.3 million followers what is the ideal level of ripeness for a banana.
Using a 1to15 scale, with 1 being the most underripe and 15 being the most ripe, users were asked to rate their ‘perfect’ banana.
As ever, social media is proving to have a wide range of opinions on the matter as thousands of commentators left their responses.
The majority of banana-lovers said they would opt for numbers 8 through 10 from the bunch, indicating that green skin was a big no-no.
Others plumped for numbers 6 and 7 showing that they were not scared off by a younger banana, while more adventurous respondents said they were likely to go for a brown and squishy number 11.
Of course there were some who thought that number two, almost entirely green, was the way to go.
Food expert Rhiannon Lambert, choosing a banana with a specific ripeness could be beneficial to those suffering from diabetes or digestion trouble.
“Bananas are a fruit that may be limited in a diet prescribed to those who suffer with diabetes due to the high content of free sugars, however, that is at the discretion of the health professional”, she told the Daily Mail.
“Research suggests that in under-ripe bananas, starch constitutes 80-90 per cent of the carbohydrate content, which, as the banana ripens, changes into free sugars. Therefore, people who suffer with diabetes are advised to eat bananas that are not overly ripe as not to spike their blood sugar too much. When the resistant starch changes to simple sugar, a banana ripens, and studies have suggested that more ripe (yellow) bananas are easier to digest for the average person. The higher glycemic index of ripe bananas shows that they are digested more quickly. Think of a tennis player snacking on a banana for a burst of energy. However, if you love bananas, enjoy them how they you think they taste best. You could eat unripened bananas or ripened bananas and still reap the benefits of this nutritious fruit. The only difference is that for individuals with Type 2 Diabetes.”
