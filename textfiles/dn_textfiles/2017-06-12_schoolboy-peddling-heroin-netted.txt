Schoolboy peddling heroin netted

 A 17 year old schoolboy transporting 400 milligrams of heroin in a motorcycle was nabbed by Medagama police at Polgahawela, Medagama on June 10.
A team on road patrol had stopped the motorcycle for a routine check.
The boy had started trembling since he had no valid diving licence. When they checked his person they found four packets of heroin containing 100 milligrams each in his pockets.
The student attached to a school in Bakinigahwela is a resident in Mullagama. Although they checked his house using police mastiffs they did not find any drugs concealed there.
Police believe that the boy who is a drug addict had engaged in the sale of heroin supplied by his step father in Medagama town after school.
