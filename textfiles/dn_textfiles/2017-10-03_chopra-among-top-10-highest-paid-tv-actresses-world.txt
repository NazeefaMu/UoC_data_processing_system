Chopra among top 10 highest paid TV actresses in the world

Priyanka Chopra is on the top of her game and there is just no stopping her. The actress who has two People’s Choice Awards to her name is now among the top ten of the highest paid television actresses in the world. The star ranked eight on the Forbes list, with an estimated earning of $10 million.
The former Miss World is a global name now thanks to her American TV show ‘Quantico’, in which she plays the lead. The diva has widened her horizon by donning the producer’s hat and backing regional cinema in India. Priyanka also made her Hollywood debut this year with ‘Baywatch’ and will be seen next in two upcoming American movies set to release next year.
Talking about her Indian work commitments, she was last seen in ‘Jai Gangaajal’ in 2016 and is yet to announce her next projects. Deccan Chronicle
