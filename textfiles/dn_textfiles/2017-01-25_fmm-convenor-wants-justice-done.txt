FMM Convenor wants justice done

Free Media Movement(FMM) Convenor Seetha Ranjani yesterday accused the Yahapalanaya government of not delivering on its promise to investigate attacks on journalists from 2004-2014.
“It has been eight years since Lasantha Wickrematunga was killed and seven years since Pradeep Ekneligoda disappeared, but even the incumbent government has not taken steps to deliver justice,”she said as the Free Media Movement held a candle light vigil under the theme of “Two years since Yahapalanaya but January is still black,” at Independence Square.
Ranjani further explained that it has been several years since Sirasa studios and Lanka E-news were attacked in addition to several Tamil journalists in Jaffna having disappeared and these issues still persisted even though the government had promised to resolve them prior to coming into power. She hoped that at least next year, the government would be able to bring some light into the darkness of January. Prof Sarath Wijesuriya, Sandya Ekneligoda, Lasantha Ruhunuge, Saman Rathnapriya, journalists and civil society members participated at the event.
