Twelve-hour water-cut in Kenalinya, Wattala will commence today

 
The National Water Supply and Drainage Board said that the water-cut scheduled for tomorrow was re-scheduled to today from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.
The Water Board told Dasily News Online that the date was re-fixed since the two damaged 900mm steel pipes, supplying water to the Kelaniya and Wattala Divisions needed to be repaired immediately.
Areas covering the Kelaniya Provincial Council, Peliyagoda Municipal Council, Wattala Municipal Council and Hendala Provincial Council will be affected.
