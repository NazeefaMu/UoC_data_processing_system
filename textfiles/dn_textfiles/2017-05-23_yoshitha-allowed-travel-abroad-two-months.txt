Yoshitha allowed to travel abroad for two months

 
Yoshitha Rajapaksa, the second son of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was today permitted to travel to Australia for a period of two months by the Colombo High Court.
His passport was impounded by Court as part of magisterial inquiry over alleged money laundering at Carlton Sports Network (CSN).
Colombo High Court Judge A. A. R. Heiyantuduwa ordered the Kaduwela Magistrate’s Court to temporally release his passport on a personnel surety of Rs.500,000.
Yoshitha Rajapaksa through his counsel had sought an order from Colombo High Court to temporary lift his travel ban.
Filing a motion before the Colombo High Court, President’s Counsel Gamini Marapana with Nalin Marapana appearing on behalf of Yoshitha Rajapaksa had informed Court that their client was expecting to leave Australia for a period of two months, for a treatment of an ankle disorder.
Meanwhile, Deputy Solicitor General Thusith Mudalige appearing for the Attorney General did not raise objection for the request.
On March 14, 2016 four suspects including Yoshitha Rajapaksa, Nishantha Ranatunga and Rohan Weliwita were remanded over alleged money laundering case. They are currently out on bail.
