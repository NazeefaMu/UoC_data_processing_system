As the nation’s fastest growing handset and communications distributor, Metropolitan’s launch of the Micromax Q3555 also revealed its on-going desire to inject new and affordable technology into the local market.
The device is set to attract consumer attention for durable and resource-heavy smartphones. For starters, the handset is powered by a 1.2 Ghz quad core processor and accompanied by 1GB of RAM. Its 2500 mAH battery, when fully charged, can last up to nine days (based on the network condition) in standby mode. The handset also sets aside 8GB of internal storage that can be expanded to 32GB via microSD card.
The phone is equipped with a 5-inch screen, 5-megapixel autofocus front camera and 5-megapixel flash-enabled rear camera with the facility to zoom and shoot photos through enhanced image processing.
