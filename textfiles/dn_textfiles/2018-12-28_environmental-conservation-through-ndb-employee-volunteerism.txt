Environmental conservation through  NDB employee volunteerism

Identifying the importance of trees, over sixty volunteers from the NDB Southern Region in partnership with the Road Development Authority planted 1,000 trees along a 2 km stretch from Pinnaduwa to Hikkaduwa. 
A key success factor of this project is that it created awareness and caused a ripple effect, motivating others to carry out similar projects.
Sri Lanka’s Southern Highway links Colombo with Galle and Matara, with over 70,000 vehicles traveling along the highway on a daily basis. 
The Bank’s Southern Region recognized the need for growing trees along the Southern Highway to combat climate change, absorb carbon dioxide, prevent soil erosion, beautify the area, raise awareness on environment conservation and replenish trees cut down to build the highway.
The NDB Team was headed by Regional Manager Thilina Hewage. NDB commenced the “Employee Volunteerism” CSR Initiative in 2009. As a responsible corporate citizen, NDB believes that ‘Community Involvement’ goes beyond core business activities and with an objective of creating value through employee participation, the Bank encourages its employees to volunteer their time and effort to give back to the community.
Employee volunteering programs can allow workers to feel that the work they do is not only contributing to the overall success of the company, but that it is also helping out a charitable cause that is important to them.
Whilst, inculcating responsibility towards the Community and Environment in all NDB employees, this initiative also motivates them to venture out on their own and implement their own projects. As a responsible corporate citizen, NDB strives to make meaningful contributions to the society through its strategic sustainability initiatives that aim to inspire the sustainable growth of a progressive Sri Lanka. Sustainability is a strategic priority at NDB and the Bank continuously endeavours to foster it across all its business decisions and activities.
