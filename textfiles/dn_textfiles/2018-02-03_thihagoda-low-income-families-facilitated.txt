Thihagoda low income families facilitated

The government has taken measures to enhance living conditions of low income families in the Thihagoda Divisional Secretariat area.
According to the Thihagoda Divisional Secretariat, development projects initiated in the area so far have made a significant progress.
Producing liquid milk, rearing animals, manufacturing organic fertiliser, farming bees and producing cinnamon oil among others were functioning very well .
Over 500 low income families from 40 Grama Niladari Divisions in the Thihagoda Divisional Secretariat Division were carrying out the projects. Selected families are given assistance to obtain bank loans to commence livelihood projects.
