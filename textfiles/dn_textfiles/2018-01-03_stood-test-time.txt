Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera’s Message
Stood the test of time

I am honoured to extend my best wishes and gratitude to the staff and management of the Daily News, as they celebrate one hundred years of continuous publication, as Sri Lanka’s longest standing English language newspaper. Much has changed at the paper since the Daily News first came under my purview as Media Minister in 1997.
Over the last several years, the paper has transformed from Sri Lanka’s printed publication of record, into a multimedia powerhouse with a vibrant web site, apps for Android iOS and Windows Phone, and a fledgling online video arm. The Daily News stood the test of time, and has thrived in an era where newspaper circulation has decreased almost everywhere in the world except Sri Lanka, as more citizens consume their news through television and the Internet.
As venerable an accolade it is for The Daily News to have flourished over the past century, we stand united in taking the seeds of the late D.R.Wijewardene’s vision of a trusted and ubiquitous source of detailed and accurate news reporting well into the 21st century, and indeed, centuries thereafter.
