Experience Ozo

India’s latest music icon, Sid Sriram, together with six members of music maestro, A. R. Rahman’s band, ventured to Sri Lanka recently for a musical live performance. OZO Colombo stepped up as Sid’s ‘Official Hospitality Partner’.
Sid and the crew enjoyed the hospitality of OZO Colombo and thanked the management of the hotel for hosting the artists. He commended the excellent food, pleasant service, and the “amazing views from the rooms and rooftop”. Sriram posted his appreciation on social media to his global followers stating: “Thank you, OZO Colombo, for making me feel at home”.
Speaking on the partnership, the Hotel Manager of OZO Colombo, Maheesha Ratnayake, went on to state: “We are absolutely honoured and happy to be hosting Sid Sriram with us here at OZO Colombo and to be partnering with the event. We strongly believe that ventures such as this should be well supported since they undoubtedly support tourism in Sri Lanka. Moreover, we are tremendously keen on supporting international ties between the two wonderful nations and between their peoples. OZO is an international brand, and we are always looking to create possibilities, experiences and connections. Reaching out to support ventures such as this is indeed in line with our goals.”
Sid Sriram is an urban/indie singer-songwriter from the Bay Area. A graduate of the Berklee College of Music, he has trained in classical Indian music from a young age. This background has allowed him to blend musical styles seamlessly. His music has been making waves on the social networks, but has also been receiving serious recognition from the mainstream music industry.
