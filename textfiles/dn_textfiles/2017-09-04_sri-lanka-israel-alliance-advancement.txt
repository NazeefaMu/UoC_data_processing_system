Sri Lanka, Israel : An alliance for advancement

In an interview with the Daily News, Israeli Ambassador Daniel Carmon spoke about the ways in which Sri Lanka can learn from his country’s entrepreneurial spirit and says that the goal is not for Israel to provide aid to Sri Lanka, but for the two countries to collaborate more bilaterally. Speaking of the current water and agriculture crisis in Sri Lanka, Ambassador Carmon said, “We’re here and that’s part of our agenda with the Sri Lankan Government. It can be in any way that the Sri Lankan Government would decide upon, with one little nuance which is that it should not be considered as ‘help’ or ‘assistance.’ It should come out of the need to cooperate.”
Excerpts follow:
Q: How do you see the current state of relations between Israel and Sri Lanka and are there ways in which you envision ties between our two countries could be strengthened? I’m talking agricultural, economic, military, social, etc.
A: There is a long history of relations between Sri Lanka and Israel. We have witnessed fluctuations in these relations, but we are definitely on the upswing in the last few years, with the will to enrich the diversity of the relations. If you follow diplomacy and the bilateral relationship between countries in the last more than a few years, the recent generation of diplomacy practitioners look at the very vast area of disciplines that are covered by diplomacy—not only ministries of foreign affairs exchanging views on political, strategic and regional affairs, but economy and development and the various priorities of countries on the top of the agenda of today’s top diplomats. And when we look at Sri Lankan-Israeli relations, development and economic trade and arenas in which Israel can share its comparative advantages in areas such as agriculture and water, innovation, and technology are definitely on the table.
Q: Indian Prime Minister Modi recently visited Israel, and the trip was hailed a success by many foreign commentators. Do you see this as a sign of greater cooperation between Israel and South Asia?
A: Israel, in the last twenty to twenty five years, has corrected a fact of the matter from previous times in which we were less welcome in this part of the world, and since we were less welcome, we were looking more to the west, our west. And in the last twenty to twenty five years, we’ve seen a very positive development when relations with China and India have become much better. Yes, we can look at South Asia as a region, but I would rather look at things [relations with each South Asian country] as bilateral. I think that looking at South Asia as a region, rather than at the bilateral benefits and interests of each player in each bilateral relation, does not do justice to the fact that we attach great importance to the bilateral effect and not only to the multilateral. And nowadays, the world has dramatically changed, in the aspect that although the nonaligned movement is still there, within the nonaligned movement Israel has very good relations with members of a group that, as a group, is critical of Israel. But the ingredients of the group bilaterally have very good relations.
Q: In the aftermath of Modi’s visit to Israel, is there a chance an Israeli delegation would be making a reciprocal trip to South Asia any time soon, and if so, would a visit to Sri Lanka be on the agenda?
A: Since I’m the ambassador to India as well, that’s a good question relating to India, of course. We have seen in the last three years more visits and more visibility in the bilateral relationship between India and Israel, and there have been ministers going back and forth from one country to the other. Regarding Sri Lanka, unfortunately, Israeli ministers have not visited in the last few years, but Sri Lankan ministers have visited Israel, and I definitely hope that in the near or foreseeable future, we will also have Israeli ministers reciprocate visits to Sri Lanka. But I would not make the India connection—they are two different places.
Q: At Sri Lanka’s first ever drone symposium on Monday, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Champika Ranawake mentioned Israel as an example of a country that has used technology and entrepreneurship to grow its economy. Do you see parallels in how Sri Lanka has harnessed technology and entrepreneurship to do the same, or ways in which Sri Lanka could learn from Israel?
A: Part of our Israeli DNA is to share our knowledge, know-how, and experience in various fields that have boosted our economy and social and economic progress and development. We ourselves have been for years a development laboratory. We have built a nation from scratch from 1948 until now.
We have developed into a very vibrant and stable economy. We have innovation and entrepreneurship as our middle name. We have been defined as a start-up nation, with the number of start-ups per capita by far the highest in the world. And, we have also initiated a process and have contributed a process to the international community, to the UN system, of entrepreneurship for development. We hope this could benefit Sri Lanka, which has similar goals to our country concerning technology and entrepreneurship. As well, what we are suggesting to our friends in Sri Lanka is to take from the Israeli experience as a country that, out of our necessities and challenges, managed to develop systems and capacities to bridge those gaps by developing specifically in the energy, water management, desalination, recycling, and conservation.
Q: Seventeen districts in Sri Lanka are currently at a water stress state due to severe drought, and this has caused issues that span from lack of available drinking water to poor crop harvests. Israel, on the other hand, has been a pioneer in turning undrinkable or contaminated water (ocean water, for example) into drinkable water and, in general, in farming on arid land in the Negev. Are there any aid programmes in development that might allow Sri Lanka to benefit from Israeli expertise at harnessing and taking control of a difficult climate?
A: We’re here, and that’s part of our agenda with the Sri Lankan Government. It can be in any way that the Sri Lankan Government would decide upon, with one little nuance which is that it should not be considered as ‘help’ or ‘assistance.’ It should come out of the need to cooperate. The more we view it as cooperation rather than aid, the better it will be, with both sides having to contribute to this venture. We have good examples with India, with our Centers of Excellence for agriculture, which are a joint venture. But of course, Sri Lanka is not India and we have to adjust the necessities. And we will adjust to these necessities. Part of our conversation with the Sri Lankan authorities about these concerns, in the last two days I’ve had very good meetings with various members of the Sri Lankan Government, is how can we share our experience and our knowledge and our know-how, under which umbrella can we make a sustainable project that will last beyond the foreseeable future? We need to build something that we can maintain.
The agricultural centers that we have in India, for example, around 15 operative Centers of Excellence, are demonstration and training centers where farmers from around the area can come and learn and experience and see and use the technology. Perhaps we can do the same in Sri Lanka. We are negotiating with the Government to do this, though, we don’t come as donors or helpers. We come to cooperate and to share our experience.
Q: There are currently around 140,000 Sri Lankans working in Qatar, mainly in migrant labor fields like domestic and construction work. As well, around 7.5 percent of tourists to Sri Lanka (per year 2015) flew Qatar Airways. Therefore, the country is invested in the stakes of what happens there. Can you explain Israel’s position on the Qatar blockade?
A: I could give you a whole seminar about Qatar’s support for terrorist organizations. But I feel this has nothing to do with the issue at stake so I would rather talk about Sri Lanka and Israel.
