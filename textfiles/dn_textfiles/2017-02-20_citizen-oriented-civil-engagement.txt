Citizen-oriented civil engagement

It was reported recently that the Auditor’s General’s Department is planning to implement a Citizen Participatory Audit to enhance the performance, efficiency and effectiveness of the public-sector service. According to the news report, this audit system will assess the services provided by local government bodies to their constituents. An audit report will be released thereafter, based on the feedback received from the residents and other individuals who seek the services. This is a good step as a starting point. However, this writer believes we have to move further, in keeping with the trends of the other developing countries, and implement a Citizen Participatory Audit in a broader context.
The reason is obvious. With the development of democracy, citizen awareness of Government activity has increased and citizens have come forward to demand more rights as taxpayers. They express their demands through many different types of civic groups, commonly referred to as civil society.
Civic groups are exerting a huge influence on the government. They not only monitor various government activities but also intervene in government decision making. Government can no longer remain unilaterally supplier-oriented, ignoring the wishes of citizens: they must inevitably make public services consumer-oriented and responsive to the citizen needs expressed by civil society.
Participation
During the past three decades, civic groups have begun to make requests that experts in a wide range of areas of civil society be allowed to participate in the Auditor General’s audit activities. Direct participation, of course, may threaten the Auditor General’s independence, and such issue should be approached with due caution and prudence. The Auditor General should maintain independence and neutrality in relation to both auditees and all outside influences.
Indirect participation – meaning, citizen experts’ participation in audit planning as advisors—is highly recommended as it raises the Auditor General’s level of expertise, which may not be otherwise sufficient. Citizens’ wishes and complaints, which may not be fully grasped by the State audit agency, can also be conveyed appropriately through this channel.
On one hand, a key role of audit is to take a critical view of and monitor government activities from a third-party perspective. On the other hand, the activities of civil society may include criticizing/ monitoring government operations and directly participating in various government activities to achieve citizens’ objectives. Thus, the two are interrelated and similar.
It is in this context that many developed and developing countries are beginning to implement the citizen participatory audit in a broader sense. In such a setting, citizens (civil society, academic groups, community members, private sector) and the Auditor General work together to audit the processes of delivering public services and government programmes. As a result, transparency and accountability in the way government performs its functions is enhanced. This innovative civil society and Auditor General practices are adopted in a number of countries, including India, Mexico, South Korea, Argentina, South Africa, and the Philippines.
Contribution
This development is nothing new. Over the last three decades, the capacity of civil society organisations to understand, analyse, and influence public expenditure has grown dramatically. In many developing countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, non-governmental organisations (NGO), think tanks, community and grassroots organisations have been involved in the growing movement to make public expenditure more transparent and accountable.
Civil society organisations engaged in audit-focused work can contribute to public expenditure management in several ways. First, they provide critical and independent information on the impact of the expenditure on poor and low-income citizens. Second, they can help build budget literacy among citizens and facilitate discussions and debates on budgetary issues within civil society. Third, they can collate and disseminate information on public finances.
They also can provide training on public finances to citizen groups and the media, thereby strengthening the capacity of all of these groups to exercise oversight over public expenditure process and to demand accountability from government agencies. This writer believes that greater collaboration between Auditor General and civil society organisations could lead to stronger expenditure oversight by the public sector as well as civil society. This activity would facilitate strengthening the country’s good governance framework.
In rural Rajasthan, the largest state in India, an organisation called the Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan (MKSS) has, developed into one of India’s most potent social justice movements. The organisation is a union of peasants and workers and has successfully demonstrated the power of information as an effective tool to enable citizens to participate in governance. The MKSS uses innovative forums called public hearings - also called social audits - to facilitate structured and focused discussions among residents on government expenditures of public development funds in their communities.
MKSS-sponsored public hearings have had a significant impact in limiting corruption in public works projects in rural Rajasthan. The success of MKSS social audits has even influenced the state government of Rajasthan to introduce aspects of social auditing within local governance processes. The state government now requires that a social audit be held annually within each village; as part of this process, all village residents must be given an opportunity to vote on a resolution verifying that the projects in their village have been successfully completed. While this process has its limitations, it represents a radical change in the institutional space provided to citizens to audit public funds.
In South Africa, the Public Service Accountability Monitor (PSAM) was established as an independent research project at Rhodes University in 1999. It initially took on the task of tracking actions taken by the provincial administration in response to reported cases of corruption. Over time, PSAM began to shift its focus to the structural context of weak financial management that was responsible for many of these acts of corruption and maladministration. It began to systematically monitor the compliance of provincial administrative agencies with public finance regulations and administrative directives. This included creating a database of information of strategic planning within agencies and their annual and audit reports.
PSAM has achieved encouraging results in spite of working in a hostile political environment. Its research and advocacy efforts have contributed to the improvement of financial reporting standards in provincial government agencies In the Philippines, an organisation called “The Concerned Citizens of Abra for Good Governance” investigate corruption in government projects, such as the use of substandard materials and fraud in contracting procedures. It submits the findings to the national government.
Another civic organisation - Procurement Watch Inc. - in the Philippines successfully pressured the government into reforming procurement laws. It now conducts activities with the Ombudsman, government departments involved in procurement. They use their networks to add political weight to audit institution recommendations. These are only few of the success stories.
Modalities
There are three modalities of collaboration between Auditor General and Civil Society Organisations:
(1) Civil Society Organisations can conduct independent audits. In a number of countries, including India and Mexico, they have developed successfully innovative social auditing processes that are independent of formal government audit processes.
(2) Civil Society Organisations can use audit findings produced by Auditor General to hold government agencies accountable: For example, South Africa's PSAM publicizes findings from government audit reports in press releases and radio talk shows. PSAM also publishes a scorecard measuring the comparative compliance of various provincial agencies with public finance laws - these scorecards draw in part on the findings of official audit reports.
(3) Civil Society Organisations can work closely with Auditor General: Concerned Citizens of Abra for Good Government ((CCAGG) in the Philippines participated as a member of a government audit team undertaking performance audits of the public highways agency, for example.
Civil Society Organisations are the natural partner of the Auditor General, as they can play a critical role in building pressure on the system to improve overall public financial management based on the audit recommendations. In this way, Civil Society Organisations help promote accountability and transparency. Further, based on the degree of collaboration, Civil Society Organisations can provide input during the planning, execution and reporting phase of the audit process.
