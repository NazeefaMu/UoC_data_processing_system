Constitution-making only after discussions: Akila

Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam on Wednesday questioned the basis of opposing the Steering Committee interim report regarding the new Constitution, addressing the prize giving at Nalanda College, Colombo.
“The government will establish a new Constitution as they pledged before the election. If anyone is against the Steering Committee interim report, this will reveal their attitude clearly. Our purpose is to start favourable discussions on Constitutional reforms among various sections of society,” he said.
Meanwhile, Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake addressing the opening ceremony of the Rajanganaya new market building said the report will be handed over to the Maha Sangha in Anuradhapura for their advice. “We want the blessings of the Maha Sangha. They should not misunderstand. The place given to Buddhism will not change. We are ready to formulate a new Constitution in a democratic manner,” he added.
