LAUGFS Nana Maga Math Camps conclude

The LAUGFS Nana Maga Math Camps conducted in collaboration with the Ministry of Education marked another milestone of assisting over 1500 students to strengthen their mathematics knowledge through skill enhancement. The 10th program was recently conducted in Matara with over 150 G.C.E. (Ordinary Level) students participating.
The LAUGFS Nana Maga Math Camps project was launched last year together with the Mathematics Branch of the Ministry of Education,as a special educational program to augment the mathematics knowledge of G.C.E (Ordinary Level) students.
“Our aim is to continuously enhance the aptitude and skills of our students. Mathematics is a core subject that helps develop analytical skills, which is applicable in any profession and is therefore essential for career progression,” remarked Sunil Hettiarachchi, Secretary to the Ministry of Education. “Through the first phase, we facilitated programmes in 29 schools in the Southern Province. The sessions helped the students to delve deeper into the subject and broaden their knowledge by learning new mathematic application techniques. Providing a quality education is vital – our intention is to instil a solid foundation for young talent, which will shape our country’s future.”
Following an Accelerated Teaching Methodology and activity-based learning techniques, the three-day programs incorporated comprehensive and interactive learning sessions in a conducive learning environment.
“Mathematics has always been a subject area of difficulty for me. But, the different sessions conducted by the teachers during the camp has helped us to learn simple ways to comprehend certain subject areas which we have been struggling with. I never thought that studying mathematics can be so interesting and enjoyable,” commented Jeewantha Sandharuwan, one of the students who took part in the Math camps.

Susantha Vithanage, Principal of Beralapananthara College Matara remarked, “We see a significant improvement in the interest levels of students in the mathematics subject following the camps. This initiative is a great value addition for students to elevate and enrich their knowledge, and the teachers are able to incorporate advanced teaching techniques and spend additional time assisting students.”
During the first phase of the project, 3000 supplementary modules were handed over to the Ministry of Education by LAUGFS, which were distributed among students during the math camps conducted in Elpitiya, Ahangama, Ambalangoda, Dikkubura, Balapitiya, Tangalle, Kotapola, Matara, Akurassa, Kamburugamuwa and other schools in the area.
“Our partnership with the Ministry of Education stemmed with the aim of empowering and nurturing our country’s future leaders,” stated LAUGFS Holdings Managing Director, Thilak De Silva.
