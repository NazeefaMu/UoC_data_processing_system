Sithangi Pamula launch
Romance in the battlefield

Amidst the heavy flow of readers who carried bundles of books to their taste and field, a grand ceremony was held at the Special Book Launch Unit at the BMICH recently to coincide with the literary nature of September.
Who is the hero? Can you skip the boring bits? How long will it take to read? A guide to a book that is not just great, this could be the best novel ever written.
The book is Sithangi Pamula which could be loosely translated into English as ‘At the Bottom of Emotional Thoughts’. The author is Jayani Pinnawala.
Samudra Wettasinghe, in his capacity as the compere of the launch, introduced Pinnawala as the author of three books: Apeksha, Sangiliyam and Samukka. Sithangi Pamula is apparently her fourth achievement. Her newly acquired role as a writer aside, Pinnawala has held top positions in the government sector in addition to being a university lecturer as well as a diplomat.
The book is themed under the civil war with a soldier with jilted love at the centre. He tries to make a soft companion out of a Tamil girl who apparently belongs to the Tiger outfit. The girl leaves for India yet hurries back to her Sinhala lover.
Dr Leel Gunasekara in his brief yet insightful speech maintained how Pinnawala has absorbed the soldier’s character in the words and sentences.
The seasoned writer stressed the importance of enmeshing the golden era of the style of literature into the modern day write-ups.
Prof Kusuma Karunaratne recalled her memories of Jayani Pinnawala as a smart sweet girl at the University as an undergraduate. The professor, of course, has every reason to be proud of that young undergraduate now fully blossomed into a complete professional. A writer, Professor Karunaratne added, must entertain a theme on a familiar experience.
The first copy of Sithangi Pamula was handed over Jayani Pinnawala by Sarasavi Bookshop Chief H D Premasiri. The author, in turn, handed the copies to Dr Leel Gunasekera and Prof Kusuma Karunaratne.
People change. The characters in Sithengi Pamula endure extreme experiences and emerge at the end as quite different people. The miracle of the book is that its protagonist who falls in love with the Tamil girl of the opening is recognisably the same woman who withdraws from society in the end.
The novel has a particular technical feature; it passes from mind to mind, showing us the world as a consciousness moves through it. It doesn’t mean that the consciousness of the moment has any particular importance; it is just how these events were seen by one particular observer, and another observer will take up the baton in a page or two.
This is not a historical novel, but a novel that discusses events of the recent past within the memory of many of Pinnawala’s first readers. Its details are not exquisite recreations of lost practice, but ways in which an individual psychology can engage with the real world. It is about history, and how the Sri Lankan war makes an awful appearance.
