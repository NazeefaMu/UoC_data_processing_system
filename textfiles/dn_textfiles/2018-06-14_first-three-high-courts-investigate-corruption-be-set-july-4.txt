First of three High Courts to investigate corruption to be set up on July 4

The first of the three High Courts to investigate into corruption, will be established on July 4, said Co-Cabinet Spokesperson, Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne. Addressing the weekly Cabinet media briefing yesterday, he said all three High Courts would be set up in Colombo by September this year.
Cabinet has been discussing the setting up of these courts since November last year.
They are to speed up investigations into cases of bribery and corruption, complex financial crimes, funding of terrorism, misuse of state resources and organized crime.
In February of this year, Cabinet once again looked at the draft bill to establish the High Courts and granted approval to be submitted to Parliament.
The High Courts will consist of three-member judge benches appointed by the Chief Justice.
