Spruce up your living style

A preview of The Ritz Carlton Residences was held recently at The One gallery. Construction of ‘The One’, The Ritz Carlton Residences which commenced in September 2017 will complete Phase 1 in December 2021. The development project will see the construction of three towers comprising two luxury hotels, a luxury retail mall, a commercial office complex as well as 638 apartments comprising two to four bedrooms.
The largest banquet hall at the highest location in Sri Lanka, exquisite restaurants, concierge services which range from airline and private air reservations to personal shopping, housekeeping services, a vacant home care programme, a heated swimming pool, a state of the art movie theatre, well stocked library, high speed elevators that travel at six metres per second, life is made simpler for residents at The One. A biometric residential access system, central air conditioning as well as home automation and vehicle identification systems, provide living at its best.
A 200 year old heritage site which has been brought back to its former glory, The Transworks House will also be creatively re imagined as an international designer collective featuring some of the world’s leading brands. A truly high end retail experience reserved for those with a penchant for the haute couture life. Pictures by Thushara Fernando
