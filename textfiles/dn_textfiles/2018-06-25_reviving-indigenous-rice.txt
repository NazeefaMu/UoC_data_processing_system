Reviving indigenous rice

Himani Wijetunge about three decades back rose to fame as Sri Lanka’s sole manufacturer of body armour. During the period of war - the body armour she produced with help from her husband Ajitha Wijetunge, a former marine engineer, not only helped to protect the lives of the soldiers who waged battle with terrorists but also helped save foreign exchange as the military earlier used to import body armour at a much higher price.
According to Himani producing body armour locally and promoting it as a viable alternative to those imported was a battle itself, which had been won ultimately. Today in the aftermath of the war Himani, who don’t take no for an answer, is waging another battle which is to preserve and promote traditional paddy farming and indigenous rice varieties.

Himani has bought several acres of fallow paddy land in a highly residential area in Kalalgoda, Thalawathugoda in the suburbs of Colombo and is currently cultivating many indigenous rice varieties using traditional farming methods sans harmful agrochemicals.
“I had a passion for cultivation from a young age, but I never had an opportunity to make my dream a reality. By transforming this fallow paddy land to a cultivable land, I have fulfilled that dream”, Himani says whilst lovingly touching the paddy leaves.
According to Himani applying traditional wisdom in farming will help in conserving indigenous paddy varieties that are under threat of extinction. She also says some indigenous paddy varieties are disease and drought-resistant and in the past people believed that they contain medicinal properties.
“Traditional rice was considered as one of the most nutritious staple foods and traditional rice varieties were known among our forefathers for their nutritional and medicinal purposes. I intend to buy more fallow paddy land and make them cultivable and grow these varieties using traditional methods,” she said.
Managing Director of several companies, especially in the garment sector Himani was known within the business circle and media for her courageous journey to promote her company product, the locally made body armour during the period of war.
According to Himani the business had its origins in a small family-run garments factory stitching pillowcases. “At that time, almost everything used in the war was imported, even the uniforms worn by soldiers. We tried to promote our body armour and finally succeeded as it was something that could be made locally and helped save foreign exchange.”
“Passion is a driving force in my everyday life and the reason I chose a business career. I’m not fond of the mediocre and well-beaten paths and decided, at an early age, that I wanted to be in a profession I could lose my heart to, where I could be creative, where I could follow my passion and, above all, do something that would make me happy” she says.
“I was already dreaming of becoming a business woman when I was seven – day in, day out, I’d watch my father, leave the house “to do business”. I see business as something exciting and a challenge. You’ve got to be willing to go the extra mile, to give up everything to achieve your goal and to dream the impossible. You’ve got to have focus. You must not be too worried about the opinions of others. And you’ve got to be authentic. Dreaming big? If you’ve set your sights on surpassing the mediocre, the chances are that you’re going to come up against your fair share of obstacles along the way. My passion for new ventures and new challenges is still intact,” she added while noting she will strive for new innovations in business as well as in indigenous farming.
“As a citizen of this country we have a duty by the nation. Though we engaged in a business I have a strong feeling that we did our duty towards the country by producing top body armour locally to supply to the Security Forces and saved much needed foreign exchange for the government. I think that helped save many lives in the battlefront. In the same way, I feel that I also can do something to the nation at least in a small way by preserving the paddy cultivations and its traditions,” she says explaining her efforts and future aims in her life.
