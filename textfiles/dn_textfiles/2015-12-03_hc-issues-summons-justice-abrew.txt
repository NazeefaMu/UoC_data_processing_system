HC issues summons on Justice Abrew

The Colombo High Court issued summons on Supreme Court Judge Sarath de Abrew to appear before Court on January 12 in connection with an indictment filed against him for allegedly committing grave sexual abuse on a domestic aide.
Colombo High Court Judge Preethi Padman Surasena made this order for the purpose of serving indictment against Justice Abrew on next calling date.
The Attorney General had filed an indictment in the Colombo High Court against Justice Abrew for allegedly committing grave sexual abuse on a domestic aide on or around June 16 this year in Ratmalana.
The indictment was filed on two counts, for committing grave sexual abuse, which comes
under Section 365 B of the Penal Code. This is the first time a sitting Supreme Court judge had been indicted in the High Court on a criminal charge.
For the purpose of proving the charges against the accused, the Attorney General has listed 21 persons as witnesses in the case. The Attorney General has further listed six documents as production items in the case.
The Attorney General had also recommended that separate legal action be instituted in the Mount Lavinia Chief Magistrate's Court under Section 314 of the Penal Code against Justice Abrew for voluntarily causing hurt to the domestic aide. Justice De Abrew is currently on bail. A complaint was lodged at the Mount Lavinia Police by Justice de Abrew's domestic aide Nilusha Damayanthi, 39, alleging that she was assaulted and sexually abused by Justice de Abrew on June 16, 2015. The CID initiated investigations into the incident and had sought the Attorney General's
advice on the matter.
Meanwhile, Justice Abrew had filed a Fundamental Rights petition in the Supreme Court challenging the indictment filed against him in the High Courts and the petition will be taken up for support on tomorrow.
