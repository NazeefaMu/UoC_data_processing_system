Judicature Bill needs two thirds majority in Parliament

 
The Supreme Court (SC) determined that three Sections of Judicature (Amendment) Bill are inconsistent with the Constitution and need to be passed by a two thirds majority in Parliament.
The Government presented the Bill on March 6 with the aim to set up a permanent High Court-at-Bar to expedite cases of large scale corruption and financial crimes.
