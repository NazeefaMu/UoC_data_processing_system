Pivithuru Hela Urumaya commends Government’s decision

Polythene shopping bags, food wrappers:
The Pivithuru Hela Urumaya commended the Government's decision to ban polythene shopping bags and food wrappers yesterday.
Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Leader and Parliamentarian Udaya Gammanpila said he respects the decision to ban polythene shopping bags and food wrappers, but the Government had worked in a manner that creates issues.
He was addressing the media at the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya political Office at Pitakotte yesterday.
"The Government has given only three months to find an alternative solution. It is not enough to import an environment friendly substitute for polythene shopping bags and food wrappers," Gammanpila said.
He said making polythene shopping bags and food wrappers is a mass scale industry.
"A large number of people are affected by the decision to band it within a short period of time," Gammanpila said.
"The Government should take measures to find an alternative product to polythene shopping bags and food wrappers as well as a solution to those who were in the industry. However, I appreciate this decision," he said.
