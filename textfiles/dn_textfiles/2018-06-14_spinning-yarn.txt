Spinning a yarn

The story of the saree is as complex as its pleats. The six yards of elegance rarely goes wrong, provided it’s draped and styled well. There are also endless reasons and occasions to wear it. The modern women are opening up to trying out different looks and drapes. Here is a look at some of the details related to the nine yards that turn heads.
 
 Body type matters in choosing a saree 
Sarees are one of the best outfits for women. The best thing about the saree is that they are suitable for all occasions.
Whether you are travelling, heading to the office, at home or on the way to an occasion like a wedding, party, get together or any other event, the saree sets off a timeless beauty for any woman. The right saree can hide not only any flaws in your body but it can also increase your beauty in many ways and can make you look like a queen!
 
 Popular saree draping styles in Sri Lanka 
Sri Lankan women wear sarees in many styles. However, two ways of draping the saree are popular and tend to dominate the culture: the Indian style and the Kandyan style (or ‘osariya’ in Sinhalese). The Kandyan style is generally more popular in the hill country region of Kandy from which the style gets its name. Though local preferences play a role, most women decide on the style depending on personal preference or what is perceived to be most flattering for their figure.
The traditional Kandyan (osariya) style consists of a full blouse which covers the midriff completely, and is partially tucked in at the front. However, modern intermingling of styles has led to most wearers baring the midriff. The final tail of the saree is neatly pleated rather than free-flowing.
 Kandyan  saree materials 
The saree worn for a Kandyan wedding is often made of materials like silk and is richly decorated with embroidery. However an osariya worn more casually is usually of less expensive but more versatile fabric, such as cotton or linen. Batik print Kandyan sarees have also become quite popular.
 Prints for body types and occasions 
 
Taller women can carry off heavy borders really well. You can also opt for big bold prints in a variety of colours, as it tends to divert the attention from your height. If you are short, avoid big prints and heavy borders. Short and slim women should opt for sarees with a thin border, as it will make you look tall. Small to medium-sized prints will look great on you as well.
 
Saree borders 
A border of a saree also plays an important role in the woman’s personality. Most of the designers advise short women to go for a saree with no border or shorter borders. If you are tall then you should wear sarees with broad borders.
 
 Saree shades 
If you are short you should avoid big prints and heavy borders. Short and slim women should opt for sarees with a thin border, as it will make you look tall. Small to medium-sized prints will look great on you as well.
 Fabrics for Sri Lankan women 
Georgette, chiffon and net fabrics will suit Sri Lankan women best. They will snugly wrap around your body, highlighting your curves.
You should opt for dark colours while buying a saree. Your saree should never be very heavy. It can have delicate embroidery and beadwork, but it should never be too stiff. It should have a good fall, which will make you look slimmer. You can also wear a blouse with criss-cross strings holding it together. It will definitely increase your oomph factor.
If you are slim, then you should pick up cotton, silk and organza sarees. They will give you a fuller figure. You can opt for sarees in lighter colours and heavy embroidery. Go for brocade or beadwork. Since you are slim, you can opt for big and bold prints in a variety of colours. Slim women can carry off backless, sleeveless, halter neck and tube blouses really well.
 Picking accessories to match a saree 
Accessorise your saree intelligently. Clutches, shoes and statement necklaces can make or break your look. If your saree is too heavy, opt for pretty danglers and keep it simple.
 Pointers to keep in mind while draping a saree
* The way you drape a saree around your body also decides how you will look.
* By draping a saree in some particular way you can look taller, short, slimmer, fatter or strange.
* A saree should be draped properly otherwise it looks untidy, clumsy, and can make a woman appear fat irrespective of what type of saree you are wearing.
* The pleats should be even and neatly tucked.
