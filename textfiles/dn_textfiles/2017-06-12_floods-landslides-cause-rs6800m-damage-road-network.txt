Floods, landslides cause Rs.6,800m damage to road network

The national road network has suffered a damage of Rs.6,800 million due to the recent floods and landslides experienced in several districts, including Galle, Matara, Ratnapura, Hambantota, Kalutara and Colombo.
Road Development Authority (RDA) Maintenance Management Director Kamal Amaraweera said the RDA has already drawn up plans to renovate roads damaged by floods and landslides.
The renovation will be done under two categories such as temporary replacement and permanent replacement.
Under the temporary replacement category, the rubble and obstacles blocking roads are being cleared. The Pelawatta-Neluwa road and the Bulathsinghala and Galle-Deniyaya roads have already been cleared.
Under the permanent replacement programme, rehabilitation activities are being done on the 12th mile post at Labugama on the Galle-Kaluaggala road and the 77th mile-post on Galle-Deniyaya road which have been severely damaged by the disaster.
