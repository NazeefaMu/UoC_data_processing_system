Colombo FC bags Dialog Champions League title for 3rd consecutive year

Colombo FC put a determined performance to rout arch rivals Renown SC 1-0 and retain the coveted Dialog Champions League 2017/18 under lights at the Racecourse Ground, Colombo recently. Due to higher points aggregate Renown SC only needed to draw against Colombo SC at the all-important final game of the season to win the coveted title. However the lads from Colpetty put on a superlative display to win the final and the Dialog Champions League 2017/18.
