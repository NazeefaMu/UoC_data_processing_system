 China’s J. J. Construction is planning to manufacture solar panels in Sri Lanka from mid 2017.
J. J. Construction Chairman, J. J. Lee told Daily News Business that they see a great demand for solar panels and they see this as a viable investment.

He said that Jie Jie Beach was their first overseas as well as leisure sector investment. “The experience in getting into Sri Lanka was very pleasing and this was one of the main reasons for us to look at reinvesting in Sri Lanka.”
He said that they are keen to import all the raw material and manufacture solar panels in Sri Lanka. “We will also look at re exports to neighbouring countries from Sri Lanka.”
He said Sri Lankan authorities have now realised the importance of solar and they hope to come to a forward agreement with the Sri Lanka Electricity Board. “We hope to invest around US$ 60 million for the factory and will employ over 100 Sri Lankans supervised by Chinese engineers.”
He said that his JV partner White Heaven Hotel Panadura Chairman Sunil Silva has already identified a 25 acre land to put up a factory. “We hope to get the approvals from BOI soon.”
 
He said that they are upbeat of the Sri Lankan tourism sector and is planning to build three more hotels. Lee said that the Jie Jie hotel is a success story of the implementation of solar energy and will use solar for all their future endeavours.”
