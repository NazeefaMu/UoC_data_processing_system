CEA suspends quarry permit

The Central Environmental Authority had temporarily suspended the permit of a quarry at Dimbula Medfield estate due to the risk of falling rocks from the top of the mountain.
The estate managers had evacuated several families residing in the area. The CEA and NBRO had determined the blasts in the rock quarry had resulted in the risky situation.
