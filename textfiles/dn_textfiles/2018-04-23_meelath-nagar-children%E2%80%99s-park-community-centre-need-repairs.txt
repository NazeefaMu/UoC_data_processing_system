Meelath Nagar children’s park, community centre need repairs

The children’s park and the community centre at Meelath Nagar in the Addalaichenai Divisional Secretariat Division are in dilapidated condition. The Addalaichenai Pradeshiya Sabha maintain them.
Built in 1997 to mark the National Meelath Celebration Development Project, the places were not repaired for a long time.
Weeds have grown around the community centre and its parapet wall was damaged.
People in the area urge the authorities to take steps to repair them.
