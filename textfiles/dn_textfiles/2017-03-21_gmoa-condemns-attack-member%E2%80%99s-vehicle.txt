GMOA condemns attack on member’s vehicle

The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) vehemently condemn the attack on a vehicle of a member of the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC).
They do not hesitate to take countrywide trade union action if the Government continue to kill time without taking a decision on the SAITM, GMOA Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoysa said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said it is nothing new about attacking the SLMC Chairmen and its members. Former SLMC Chairman Dr. Nonis was brutally attacked in the past and then a bomb was thrown at Dr. Lalantha Ranasinghe. No action was taken in any of those incidents.
According to Dr. Zoysa, the vehicle of a SLMC member was entirely damaged.
The police should conduct an unbiased and transparent investigations into the incident and take the culprits into custody not acting like the way they acted in connection with the SAITM CEO shooting incident, which was overlooked without taking action against the persons who staged the `drama.
When a suspect came to the police station, he was sent back stating that there is no legal provisions to arrest him.
Dr. Zoysa said action should be taken against all who speak against the SLMC, which is a state body set up to protect the Medical Ordinance, an act passed in the Parliament to safeguard the rights of the patients.
The Government was given time until March 30 to take action against the attackers and to take a decision on the SAITM and the GMOA will take the decision thereafter, he said.
