‘Shortage of nutritionists in SL’

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne ordered health officials to formulate a cabinet paper to recruit 567 nutritionists, Health Ministry sources said.
According to the sources, at the moment, only 25 nutritionists work in the country and this number of nutritionists is inadequate to educate the public on correct practices to upgrade their nutrition. Considering the requirement, more nutritionists are to be recruited.
At the moment, there are 567 persons in the country who had already completed degrees and also obtained post-graduate qualifications in Nutritional Science. These graduates are to be recruited as nutritionists, the sources said.
Although Sri Lanka has high health indicators such as low maternity and infant mortality rates etc, nutrition is one area that need to further improvement. The normal Body Mass Index (BMI) is between 18.5 to 24.9. People who are bellow 18.5 considered as underweight and the people who are above 25 to 29.9 considered as overweight. The people with a BMI above 30 considered as obese.
