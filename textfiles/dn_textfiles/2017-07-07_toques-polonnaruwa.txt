Toques of Polonnaruwa

Juliet Coombe meets the Talking Toques of Polonnaruwa on a Monkey Kingdom tour with Smithsonian Primates experts who now run superb early morning tours in the ruins
Nested deep in the wilderness of this 25,000 square mile island of Sri Lanka is an ethereal ancient city in which the Toques monkeys cohabited with man in this once thriving one thousand year old kingdom of Polonnaruwa devoted to Buddha and his teachings, science, advanced irrigation systems, medicine and grand architectural designs.
The changing times
A thousand years on, the ruins of this hydraulic civilization are still amazingly well preserved for a city that was brought to its knees by the invasion of the South Indian King Kalinga Magha in 1215 AD, who brutally removed the eyes of King Parakrama and tortured him and his people to death. Biking and walking around this magnificent site with primates experts one sees the mischievous Toque monkeys in a new light as you go around some of the most fascinating historic sights including the countries most advanced Ayurveda hospital. On the morning I went one of the 38 troops living in the Polonnaruwa sanctuary were playing early morning in the medical hospital ruins, which still have a complete human shaped treatment room to cure snake bites with a herbal bath.
As you learn about Toques grooming one can take in the majesty of this huge monastery complex and at a time when Buddha’s teachings drove these spiritually advanced people to not waste even a drop of water and be a part of nature and not apart from it. Abandoned for around seven hundred years by man but not by beast, the Toque Macaque monkeys, one of three species of Macaque found in Sri Lanka, still remember who they are and what they are doing here, in the jungle ruins of the UNESCO World Heritage site, Polonnaruwa, even though the forest is under threat as the numbers of trees are declining. The monkey numbers in contrast have evolved with the changing times finding new food sources in people’s near by homes, and numbers as a result are going up. This is good news on one hand as they form a key part of the ecosystem by eating fruits and dispersing seeds through defecation and as such vital to the jungle surroundings. However today like the elephant human conflict, increasing numbers of Toques are creating a human monkey conflict as well.
Intelligent creatures
Walking around observing their habits one can just imagine the conversations of the monkeys watching us observing them “Why have they come back?” one can almost hear the female known to the team at Jezuma with her baby, who she gently caresses until the naughty monkey calms down and falls to sleep in her arms. You will learn from the primates guide that there are around 1000 Toque Macaque monkeys in the sanctuary defined area of Polonnaruwa, arranged into 38 troops with groups ranging from 5 to 70 in each, comprising of complex social orders of these highly engaging, dextrous and intelligent creatures.
Toques it seems on close inspection look younger the older they get until when adult they have a full head of hair resembling a brimless hat, possibly giving rise to the original haircuts we saw The Beatles sporting in the 1960s music scene but certainly giving rise to their name, Toque, meaning ‘whorl of hair.’
The offspring need to be tough in this environment where, owing to food scarcity at times and stiff competition, only around 60% make it past infancy with only a stunning 15% to 20% reaching adulthood although these numbers according to the guides are changing as the monkeys find new ways to get food by raiding local village homes.
Alerting others
The monkeys carry on about their business of monkeying around trying to steal pilgrim flowers with their allies the Grey Languar from the altar of the Gal Vihara sacred Buddha site, although in some cases it feels like they are also taking them in offerings to the lying Buddha as often they leave some here and wander off to do some daily grooming.
Suddenly, the peace is broken and the air is electrified with the sound of a hard braking high speed train-like noise from the wide open mouth of one of the other males, revealing two huge fangs that can rip through human flesh. I am told by the guide that he isn’t best pleased with another approaching troop of competitors. As if it isn’t enough to have to forage in the current desert like dry zone conditions with temperatures so hot that by 9am your feet feel like they are on fire from the sand underfoot. Male dominance is also seen as a form of birth control, through being the first eaters and leaving the weaker to go hungry, and so a natural population balances mechanism for when food goes short in this rather brutal wild ancient kingdom. Toques also make birdlike noises when alerting others to threats such as pythons as they have excellent eye site protecting us as we follow them through the bushes. Interestingly until the Toques monkeys are one years of age they can’t talk and when the alarm call comes the group of mothers pick up the nearest baby and climb the trees, where they return the young to the rightful mother.
This new scene of brooding violence where the males of each troop will fight it out for the right to eat and mate like a scene from Gangs of New York, is watched over by the equally unyielding and contrasting manmade edifice, standing for over a millennium, with its beautifully rounded white dome made out of white uneven plaster with ribbed cone pointing to the heavens, directing us to strive for that inner peace within our souls and nature.
