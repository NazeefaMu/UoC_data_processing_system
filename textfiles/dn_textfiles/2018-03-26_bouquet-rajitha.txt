A bouquet to Rajitha

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne has come in for a lot of praise for the steps he has taken to bring relief to the public by reducing the prices of certain essential drugs. It goes without saying that medication is as important as food for survival for a certain category of patients who are sustained by drugs. In most instances they are left without the wherewithal to purchase their drugs and are dependent on their offspring or family members. Hence, the high cost of drugs may pose a burden to the entire family, as well.
It is essential that drug prices are kept to a minimum so that they will be affordable to the perennially ailing, particularly those in the evening of their life. To this category belong the pensioners whose eternal lament has been that they are unable to purchase life saving drugs due to their high prices, with the meagre sum they receive as pensions, going by the public columns of the newspapers. It is this vulnerable sections that are mostly at risk due to vital drugs being beyond their purse.
The minister’s move to reduce the prices of certain essential drugs will therefore be of immense relief to these sections. The minister has slashed the prices of 48 essential drugs. In India the prices of some 600 vital drugs have been reduced. It would be most welcome if the Dr. Senaratne considers reducing the prices of at least 100 drugs, if not more. True, the price reduction of essential drugs effected by the minister did not endear himself to the multinational drug companies, known for their penchant for unconscionable profits. Perhaps, this also alienated the minister from the GMOA, and, most attributed the doctors’ running battle with the minister to this factor. It is well known how pharmaceutical company representatives visit government doctors during duty time and occupy their time in lengthy sales talk, to the neglect of patients. It is also well known how doctors receive foreign trips, curtsy these pharmaceutical companies, as quid pro quo. Hence, the rumours connecting the government doctors with these pharmaceutical companies and this forming the basis for their animosity with the minister could not be entirely unfounded. Still, the minister deserves praise for standing up to the pharmaceutical mafia and taking the side of the poor patients, by his bold decision to slash the prices of essential drugs.
In fact Minister Senaratne has gone one better and taken steps to reduce the cost of certain treatments provided at private hospitals. A gazette notification on controlling 50 different treatments provided by private hospitals will be issued soon, Dr. Senaratne told parliament on Thursday. “I have already discussed the matter with the office bearers of the Private Hospital Owners’ Association (PHOA) and informed them that charges will be controlled and a gazette issued shortly, the minister stated. Earlier the minister also reduced the VAT imposed on charges levied by private hospitals in relation to certain tests carried out and also consultant fees, which, no doubt, would have endeared himself to the public, who, hitherto, had been forced to pay astronomical amounts by way of private hospital bills even for the simplest of treatments.
However, the private hospitals could offset these positive steps by recourse to other means to fleece the sick. It is common knowledge that doctors at these private hospitals order numerous tests on their patients that in most instances are superfluous and they (patients) are billed huge sums for these tests. The patients are left with no option but submit to these tests rather than take a chance. True, there is nothing that the minister could do to check the authenticity of these tests. This could well be the reason that he has thought of controlling the cost of certain treatments at private hospitals, which is to be commended.
Other measures too should also be adopted to force these private hospitals to fall in line. Today, private hospitals are in huge demand and are patronized by even the ordinary folk due to the poor facilities at the state hospitals. The public also prefer the personalized attention they receive at private hospitals and the pleasant atmosphere, compared to the poorly run government hospitals. There are also special state of the art facilities at these private hospitals that are lacking in government hospitals that draw the public to the former. Of course the state medical institutions are much improved today, compared to the past, with up to date facilities in most of them. Yet, the unkempt and chaotic state of government hospitals force the public to seek private medical care much against their will. Hence, this situation needs remedying.
There is also the crying need for more doctors in the country. Recent media reports shed light on the fact we are short of some 8,000 doctors. The recent strike action by medical students over the SAITM issue only went on to aggravate the situation. Immediate measures are called for to address this problem. A moratorium should be placed on doctors seeking greener pastures abroad for a certain period so that the country avails itself of their services. After all, their education was paid for by the public.
