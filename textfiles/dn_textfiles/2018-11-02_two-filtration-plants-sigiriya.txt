Two filtration plants for Sigiriya

The PINA organisation, together with the navy and the Presidential Task Force, inaugurated two filtration plants recently at Sigiriya.
The plants were set up to resolve the drinking scarcity at Sigiriya as thousands of tourists visit the area daily. North-central Province Navy Commander M.M.H. Gamage opened the plants during an inauguration ceremony in which navy, air force and government officials participated.
