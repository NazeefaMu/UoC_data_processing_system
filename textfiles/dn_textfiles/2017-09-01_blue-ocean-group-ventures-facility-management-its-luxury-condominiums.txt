Blue Ocean Group ventures into facility management for its luxury condominiums

 The Blue Ocean Group has today grown into a formidable leader and trendsetter in over six industries including real estate, construction, engineering, trading, education and corporate consultancy.
Blue Ocean Group has understood this important aspect and is striving to deliver luxurious condominiums to discerning buyers.
Not only has Blue Ocean Group developed innovative building methods to deliver construction projects on time and on budget but it has also understood that in most cases condominium buyers choose that lifestyle or investment for ease of maintenance.
As a result, Blue Ocean Group formed its own facility management company under its group by serving all facilities such as building maintenance service and wealth management.
Hence one could say that Blue Ocean is a total package that provides all real estate services from condominium development to maintenance, thereby obtaining worldwide recognition as Sri Lanka’s largest and the most convenient condo developer.
The key factor that helps Blue Ocean set it apart from industry competitors is fulfilling a property seeker’s requirements by providing them with a dream home. This is why Blue Ocean Group chooses to provide the expertise of Blue Ocean Facility Management to enable buyers to have reliable property maintenance.
This connection between the different arms of the Blue Ocean Group also helps in the construction phase of the properties. As the group also engages in manufacturing ready mix concrete, importing building materials, heavy machinery and providing engineering and architectural consultation, clients have access to all the capabilities that Blue Ocean has to offer.
It also means there is less likelihood of barriers in coordination that can occur when a builder has to work with different organisations in order to obtain materials and expertise to complete a project.
Their apartments have appreciated in value by 50 to 70%. All Blue Ocean projects have been governed by ISO 9001:2008, 14001:2015 and OSHAS 18001:2007, in addition to meeting other international standards.
Consisting of over 30 condominium projects and developing over 1,100 units, they are situated in the island’s most prestigious locations. The engineering arm has been one of the very few companies who have won accolades from the major Contractors Association of Sri Lanka, the Green Building Council, the Construction and Industrial Development Authority and the Chamber of Construction Industries.
For all these reasons, homebuyers and astute investors have decided to choose from the Blue Ocean Group’s wide selection of apartments.
The Group’s consistent year-on-year improvement in financial results is a signal of the financial sustainability of its business model.
From a social perspective, its infrastructure projects across the country have a significant bearing on the communities in the area and have improved the standard of living of its stakeholders.
