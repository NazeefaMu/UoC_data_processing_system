New Kidney Transplant Unit at NHSL

A new 17-storey Kidney Transplant Unit will be constructed at the National Hospital of Sri Lanka (NHSL), Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Addressing the gathering after laying the foundation stone for the new kidney unit to be constructed at the Hambantota (new) General Hospital, at a cost of Rs. 240 million, Minister Senaratne said there are rules and regulations that hinder the progress of the work. It was the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa who overlooked the work and he worked hard, the minister pointed out.
Minister Senaratne said no President from any political party did such a good job than President Premadasa. Some question as to what this ‘good governance’ government did during the past three years. The workload carried out for the poor by the Health Ministry and the Housing Ministry is adequate to show the work carried out for the poor by this government, he said.
