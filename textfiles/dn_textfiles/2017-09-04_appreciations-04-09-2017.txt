[APPRECIATIONS - (04-09-2017)]

A. H. M. Azwer
A down-to-earth politician
It is with sadness I mourn the passing away of my friend A. H. M. Azwer. The late Azwer was a warrior with a cause who chartered the course of politics and politicians with his simplicity and loyalty, which was his hallmark to his last.
I fondly recall, it was a Friday morning, just after morning (Subhu) prayers in 1988, Azwer was going through his daily mail following the Presidential Election victory. To his dismay, he had received a letter of termination for not reporting to work.
Azwer was the Private Secretary to the then Southern Province Governor Al Haj Bakeer Markar. The reason for his failure to report to work was due to the fact that he accompanied the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa during his campaign, addressing over 150 meetings across the country. This election was marred with violence spanning from North to South. It was a hard-fought campaign which was won by the United National Party candidate Ranasinghe Premadasa.
Azwer waited till sunrise, heartbroken and devastated, got ready and walked to Galle Road and got on a CTB bus and left for Bambalapitiya. Thereafter, he walked to my residence. Rather exhausted and eyes filled with tears, he gave me the letter he had received and said, " I have been given an award." I told him Haji, don't worry, this is a blessing in disguise; now your place is in Parliament.
I had planned to go to Singapore that night and invited Azwer to join since he needed a well-deserved rest. Immediately, I called our mutual friend Omar Kamil and conveyed what happened to Azwer and requested him to prepare a CV for him. I asked him to join us for our usual Friday lunch and went to Suchaitha to wish the President Elect Ranasingha Premadasa. In the meantime, I managed to get a copy of the letter removing Azwer to President Premadasa through the late A. J. Ranasinghe.
After Jummah prayers and lunch, we went to Sucharitha. VIPs including well-wishers were queuing to greet the President Elect. Southern Province Chief Minister M. S. Amarasiri walked in and I gave him a copy of the letter sent by the Governor. Azwer was very angry with me for distributing copies of the letter.
Around 7.30 pm, we were asked to come to wish the President Elect.
The three of us walked in and as soon as President Premadasa saw Azwer, he jokingly said, "you have been sacked." Copy of the letter dismissing Azwer was on his table.
The President asked Azwer "What are your plans?" In response, I said, "Sir you must have him in Parliament." President Premadasa said that that was a very good idea and asked from which district he would like to come forward to contest. I promptly said, "Sir, we can't field him from any district as he will be travelling with you in the campaign and therefore, let him come on the national list." Saying that, I handed over Azwer's CV to President Premadasa. President Premadasa immediately called the party's General Secretary Ranjan Wijeratne and told him to include Azwer's name in the national list.
The President wanted us to go to Sirikotha and immediately meet the Party General Secretary. I told President Premadasa that Azwer was dejected this morning when he received the letter which removed him from the post as Private Secretary to the Governor of the Southern Province. The President assured me that Azwer will be appointed through the National List to Parliament.
That night, with great relief, we both left for Singapore. Following the General Election, Azwer was nominated to Parliament from the United National Party. This is the true story of how Azwer was able to enter Parliament. Over the years, whether in or out of power, Azwer was true to himself; he never misused his position and always lived life in a down-to-earth manner, strictly following the five pillars of Islam. Azwer leaves us at a crucial juncture in Sri Lanka's political landscape, where wisdom and foresight of experienced politicians such as Azwer would be sadly missed.
May the almighty Allah grant Azwer the highest place in Jannah.

Sri Lankan High Commissioner to Malaysia
