German Expatriate assaults lady Secretary

A German Expatriate attached to GITEC a consultancy firm involved in the construction of the Karapitiya Maternity Hospital Project is alleged to have assaulted a lady Secretary in Public. She was later admitted to the Karapitiya hospital for treatment, an official attached to project told the Daily News. Doctors after medical investigations have said her muscle tissues have been damaged. When I ask the lady as to how this incident happened she said, “Our team Leader asked me to make a new appointment with a lawyer who is practicing in Colombo by cancelling the earlier appointment that he had been made with the Lawyer and extend it to the following Monday.”
“Although it is the responsibility of his personal assistant who is an Ethiopian lady, whom he called his fiancee, she could not handle it because her English knowledge is poor. Her work load too was handled by me even though she is drawing a higher salary paid out of Government money obtained for the Karapitiya Maternity hospital project,” she said.
“Although I tried my best to contact the Lawyer my attempts failed because the lawyer was in Court. When tried to explain the difficulty to contact the Lawyer, suddenly he jumped on me and started blaming me in indecent language. I was frightened and tried to escape from him but he grabbed me by my neck and pushed me out of the door abusing me in slang,” the victim explained.
