Case against Rohitha Abeygunawardena fixed for trial

 
A case filed against former Minister, Kalutara District MP Rohitha Abeygunawardena allegedly for unlawfully acquiring assets worth Rs.41.1 million was fixed for trial by Colombo High Court today.
Accordingly, the case will be taken up for trial on July 3 and 5.
Meanwhile, High Court Judge Sampath Wijeratne permitted the defence to access evidence from the computer for the case and permitted the defence to inspect them on June 12, 13 and 14.
At an earlier occasion, the High Court overruled a preliminary objection raised by former Minister against the Bribery Commission's decision to amend charges.
 The Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption filed an indictment in the Colombo High Court on two counts against former Minister Rohitha Abeygunawardena for unlawfully acquiring assets estimated worth Rs.41.1 million.
 In his indictment, the Director General of the Bribery Commission alleged that the former Minister committed this offence by way of undeclared assets in between 2004 to 2006.
 The Director General alleged that the former minister had unlawfully made 66 monitory transactions, constructed a house and purchased a jeep in contravention to the section 23(a) of the Bribery Act. The Director General further alleged that former Minister Abeygunawardena had owned these properties-deems under the provision of the act to be property acquired by bribery.
