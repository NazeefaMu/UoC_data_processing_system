Join the UNP to develop rural areas - Mangala

Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera called on all Sri Lankans to join with the United National Party (UNP) to strengthen the government to develop the nation.
“At a time that the government has allocated more funds than that was ever allocated for the education and health sectors and Rs. 38 billion for the development of rural roads next year, we invite the constituents of Matara and all Sri Lankans to join the United National Party (UNP) to strengthen the government to develop our nation,”he said. Samaraweera was addressing media personnel at the District Secretariat Matara last morning, after handing over the nomination lists for the Matara Municipal Council and the Matara Pradeshiya Sabha.
“As much as we won over our nation, within the past three years our government has been able to win the goodwill of other nations in the world and look forward to win the support of the rural community as well. I call upon all members of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party not to allow elements that made this country a center for commission agents and nurtured the white van culture to suppress the media to rise their heads again” On being asked about the crisis faced by the tea industry the minister said that he had had discussions with the Russian Ambassador the previous day and was confident that the crisis will be resolved soon.
