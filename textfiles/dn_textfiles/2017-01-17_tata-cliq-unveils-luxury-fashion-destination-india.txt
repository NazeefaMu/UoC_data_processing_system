Tata Cliq unveils luxury fashion destination in India

Tata Cliq, the Tata group?s unique multi-brand phygital e-commerce platform that combines online commerce with offline shopping experience, has unveiled a luxury fashion and lifestyle destination. Offering an unparalleled experience of luxury shopping, Tata Cliq aims to become ‘The definitive destination for luxury fashion and lifestyle’ in India.
Initially, the new online luxury fashion destination, luxury. tatacliq.com, will house a wide range of apparel and accessories for men and women by luxury and bridge-to-luxury brands like Hugo Boss, Armani Jeans, Coach, Furla, Tumi, G-Star, Michael Kors, and EA-UG.
“While, the demand for luxury products is growing steadily in India, we found that access to luxury brands is scarce due to the limited availability of premium retail real-estate. With the launch of our luxury platform, we aim to provide our consumers with a curated assortment of the best brands with the most authentic brand experience,” said Tata Cliq CEO Ashutosh Pandey.
The ecosystem of Tata Cliq Luxury will be complimented by robust delivery network across 6,000 pin codes in India, original warranties and guarantees, superlative service support, and no-questions-asked return policy.
“We have launched Tata CLiQ Luxury with a selection of eight bridge-to-luxury brands and will soon be adding more brands. We are working on a completely new and unique experience for the luxury-lifestyle consumers where, for the first time in India, we will be blending cutting-edge technology with delightful service across all consumer touch points including the store, web, mobile and social platforms,” Amit Rawal, head of business-Tata Cliq Luxury, said.
“We are confident of becoming the ‘platform of choice’, for not only the existing luxury brands in India, but also new brands looking to enter the growing Indian market, due to our comprehensive omni-channel offering and experience in building luxury lifestyle brands,” he added.
