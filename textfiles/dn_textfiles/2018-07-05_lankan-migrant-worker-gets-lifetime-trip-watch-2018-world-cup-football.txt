Lankan migrant worker gets lifetime trip to watch 2018 World Cup football

A Sri Lankan migrant worker helping to build the 2022 World Cup had the trip of a lifetime when he was taken to the opening match of the current tournament in Russia.
Najeem Inamul Hasan, 27, was among eight workers invited to accompany the former Barcelona star, Xavi Hernandez, on a five-day visit to Moscow.
Xavi is global ambassador for the tournament Qatar will host in four years’ time and head of the Generation Amazing programme, tasked with helping build football at grassroots level as part of its World Cup legacy.
During the trip the group attended the opening ceremony and first match of the tournament at Moscow’s Luzhniki Stadium which saw the hosts beat Saudi Arabia 5-0.
Najeem, from Mutur in Eastern Sri Lanka: ‘The most exciting part of the trip was watching the opening match of the World Cup, which was a tremendous experience and an incredible atmosphere in the stadium. The hospitality of the Russian people was wonderful.’
Among the party were also workers from Ghana, India, and Bangladesh, who were all hand-picked because of their work as Generation Amazing coaches who could go back to Doha and inspire others. Xavi, who won the World Cup with Spain in 2010, met up with Russian youth footballers.
He said: ‘We have workers here from Qatar, but the programme also helps people in their home countries. As the word says, I think this programme is spectacular, so I am proud to have shared this experience with this group.
‘To be at the World Cup is a once in a lifetime experience, and I too am learning a lot every day from all those taking part in the fantastic project’.
As a young boy Najeem’s life was thrown into turmoil when his home was caught up in the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami and the family moved to Pottuvil. By the time he was 18 he had lived in four different places and been in five different schools.
He started played in a local football team, Liverpool FC, named after the legendary English side, and was able to do this regularly when he moved to Qatar in 2016 and joined Generation Amazing while working on the construction of World Cup stadiums.
‘All the workers love to play football in their free time, and Generation Amazing has been a wonderful tool for them to change their lives,’ he said. ‘It was a fabulous experience in Russia. I learned a lot more about Generation Amazing and leadership with Xavi Hernandez, and we did a wonderful session with Russian youth from the Best Buddies organisation.
‘Programmes like Generation Amazing are making a difference to people and the World Cup in Qatar will bring cultures together like no other tournament. In future I would like to use my experience in Russia to create more leaders and ambassadors in Qatar and my community, and I already have a plan to start Generation Amazing in my home country soon.
‘We also had a chance to meet the English legend Stan Collymore, it was a great day and everyone enjoyed it.’
Generation Amazing, which was set up by Qatar’s Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy, hopes to benefit a million people around the world by 2022 by promoting football at grassroots level, often in poorest communities.
Qatar will also be taking sixteen youth ambassadors from Qatar, India, The Philippines, Nepal and Pakistan to the Russian tournament.
