Prelates call for ‘spiritual mindset’ during Poson Poya

King Devanampiyatissa met Arahat Mahinda Thera at the foot of the Mihintale rock 2,326 years ago on a Poson Poya. Thereafter, a massive spiritual and cultural revolution took place making both the king and the subjects nonviolent and righteous. In this context, I feel that the President and the Prime Minister should inaugurate the Anuradhapura national Poson religious festival with the blessings of the Mahasanga and for the spiritual benefit of the devotees commemorating the Mihindu Buddhist vision, making it a tradition to be followed annually, the Chief Sangha Nayaka of the Nuwara Kalaviya and the Ruwanweli Chethiyamaradhipathi Ven. Pallegama Hemarathna Nayaka Thera told the Daily News, referring to the National Poson Festival this year.
The Nayaka Thera said further that the both government and private sector authorities should discourage the holding of carnivals, musical shows and unwarranted commercial advertising, underestimating Buddhism and its unique teachings, during the Poson Poya and the two days before and after the Poya.
It seems that some government agencies and private sector institutes organise commercially-friendly programmes, enterprises, and trade promotion campaigns targeting the devotees visiting the Anuradhapura and Mihinthale sacred zones for Poson religious observances. The Thera appealed to devotees to focus on the religious observances.
The Mihinthale Rajamaha Viharadhipathi Ven. Walawahengunuwewa Dhammarathna Nayaka Thera said that Buddhists commemorates the 2,326 Mihidhu Jayanthi or the 2,326th National Poson festival tomorrow.
The Thera said that it was a pity that some groups were used to celebrating this unique event adhering to non-religious techniques, provocative conduct, appearance and anti-social activities not befitting a genuine Buddhist.
He appealed to devotees, especially the youth, to avoid all unethical behavior and be exemplary Buddhists.
