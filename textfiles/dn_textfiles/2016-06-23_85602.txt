PM launches ‘UNP App’ to take the country foward

As the UNP turns 70 this September, its leadership is looking at innovative ways to reach out to young voters who could impact the long term sustainability of the party.
“The country cannot go forward without the UNP,” said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as he launched the mobile application ‘UNP App’ which allows users to obtain an electronic membership from the party for a sum of Rs 20.
“I say to the youth, come join us and take the party forward. Our time is soon coming to an end, learn from our experience and take it forward from there,” the UNP leader added.
The mobile app, members of the UNP say was a brainchild of its leader and comes at a time when youth and social media have a greater impact at elections than traditional methods of canvassing. It will also give the UNP valuable data on the youth who are interested in the UNP, thus being able to target their policies accordingly. “Though our core principles and vision remain the same, the UNP has always been a party which has adapted according to the times. Thus today we launch our electronic membership drive though the UNP App”, said UNP General Secretary, Kabir Hashim.
Hashim explained that the app would make it easier for the youth to engage with the party and get the information they need. It is also connected to their other social media sites such as facebook, twitter and Youtube.
“The UNP has always been a progressive party, our founders sought independence when nobody thought that was possible and today as we get closer to 70 years, we need to take the country forward. The world is different today from that of 1977 or 1947.
“We need to join the world and to do that we need IT technology,” Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
As the UNP launched its e-membership drive, the Prime Minister recalled that former President J R Jayewardene had them selling membership cards for Rs 1 from house to house but today their app would have reached the people before the party cadres reach their homes.
The app launch yesterday coincided with former President Premadasa’s birth day and the Prime Minister explained that they would roll out similar new programmes until former President J.R. Jayewardene’s birthday on September 17.
