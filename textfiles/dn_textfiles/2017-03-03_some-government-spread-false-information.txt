Some in government spread false information

Western Province Chief Minister Isuru Devapriya yesterday alleged that certain groups within the government were using police officers close to them to spread false information regarding the state of national security in the country.
“We have different groups within the national government and they may have different opinions,” he went onto explain and added that certain groups were trying to use this false information to create unrest and show that there is a problem with the security situation in the country.
“The President gained votes of the North and East and at the same time, he is very focused on national security having survived several threats from the LTTE,” the Chief Minister addressing a SLFP media briefing at SLFP Headquarters said.
“These groups like the Northern Province Chief Minister is openly racist and is playing communal politics. But we in the South are living with all communities. In Colombo, the Muslims and the Tamils make up the majority but we have managed to win their confidence. We can no longer play ethnic politics,” he said.
