Uniquely United in MUSIC

‘Billa’ is the latest groovy song that you can’t help but get you moving. Just released one week ago this groovy punchy song is by Centigradz, a music band well loved by local and international fans. We met them at their studio where most of the magic happen to find out how this tale of music unfolded.
“We released the song `Billa’ just a weekago and have had a great feedback. We got air play on main radio stations and the song is on social media and you tube. We did this song after one and half years and fans have been demanding a song from us. We thought this time we will give them something to dance thus we composed this upbeat, groovy song to make them move. The lyrics of the song are by Ranuka Jeewantha and music is by Thusith Niroshana,” Amila Niroshan who is managing the bands schedules and the main RAP artist said.
According to Amila this journey of lifting the spirits of people up and making them happy with their songs and their magical sounds has begun almost fifteen years ago. When a few college boys of St John’s College Nugegoda - Amila, Udaya, Isuru, Ishan and Thusith crossed the paths and formed a band, they never thought the band will be where they are today.
“We merely followed our passion and the common dream of making unique music. We got invited from several schools to perform. We got some good feed backs from our audiences and we continued our passion and here we are today loved by our fans and followers,” Amila reminisced.
Technical side
The journey since then has been smooth, slow and steady for Centigradz. Today the four Centigradz members Ishan, Eranga, Thusith and Amila together with numerous others behind the scene do wonders with notes and sounds. Apart from singing as a band they also perform at corporate events, weddings and other functions.
Centigradz also take up in house productions for commercials and trailers while running a school for music production. “Anyone can join this school and follow a short course on digital composing. They can learn the basics which will enable them to be professionals and project themselves to take up production. Music is not just singing but a person has to be well versed with technical side of it too. Today most of the youngsters entering the field do not know the international artists or Sri Lankan folk music thus their journey is short,” Thusith Niroshana who is handles several aspects including the music production and composing voiced.
“If you want to be professional in the field of music you have to know what you are doing and have to get your basics correct. In our country at present there is lot of exposure.
Professional music
There are companies that will bring you to lime light, write songs for you compose music but after sometime when you are on your own if you don’t know the basics you have no place to go. The society is changing and trend is changing rapidly so you really have to work hard to be in the field,” says Amila. Making music the right way, the band has to its name many awards and accolades. From winning the international award `Excellent New Singer Award’ at Asia Pacific World Star Quest in Penang Malaysia in 2008 to local accolades Centigradz have excelled in professional music industry in Sri Lanka inspiring the young music lovers. “The vocals in present songs are amazing there is lot of talent out there but the Sri Lankan touch is missing. The best example is K-pop (abbreviation of Korean pop) which is characterized by a wide variety of audiovisual elements. It is a modern form of South Korean pop that is influenced by styles and genres from around the world, such as Western pop music, rock, experimental, jazz, gospel, Latin, hip hop, R&B, reggae, electronic dance, folk, country, classical, and Europop on top of its uniquely traditional Korean music roots. This has taken the world by storm, “Amila explains.
He points out that this is what Sri Lanka needs to do as well. “We have to break through this to the international level. There are no agencies to represent the music bands here.
We need a systematic support - financially theoretically and funding to take our music and talents to the world,” Amila added. Pawan De Silva, Digital Audio Engineer and music composer joined in to add that Sri Lankan music is not connected enough to the world.
“It needs just one break through to take the amazing talents here globally. The talent and creativity we see today can match any international act,” Pawan said. He raises concerns on the issues youngsters face in entering the music field. “It takes a lot of effort to start a career in the field. There are lots of talented people but the support is missing. As there is a huge competition talented people are not given the opportunity. I believe that an artist cannot be framed. The talent one possesses cannot be taken away. The creativity of each person varies as music is a product. No one can steal your talent but you got to be patient to gain the necessary experience to reach the top. You have to have the originality in your work,” Pawan explained.
Negative message
“We learn every day from music. Music also has an impact on the society. If we take the recent suicide rates more males died by suicide than the females. If you look at the songs that were released recently most of them had this negative message. The audience should be wise in selecting what they are listening to,” he advised. All band members are grateful to their fans in Sri Lanka and around the world. “Our main fans are Sri Lankan. We have a fan base internationally in Europe, Australia, Japan and with the song we did for the world cup cricket we got our selves introduced to countries like India and Bangladesh.
We will continue our journey making people happy. We are doing what we like doing the most and will create positive vibes for our people,” members said.
The band is excited in touring Italy soon to sing at the Sri Lanka Italy beauty pageant for the fourth time and Daily News wishes them all success.
