Ushering New Year in style

Guests at Calamander Unawatuna beach were treated to a spectacular display of lights, decorations and fabulous array of foods from all over the world at the dawn of the New Year. Party goers feasted whilst the multi-talented band, 16 by Four played songs from the pantheon of classic pop.
The Navy drummers, dressed in shimmering Shalwar Kamese and golden turbans, treated the crowd, assembled on the beach side deck, with the heart stirring beat of their drums.
Two clowns complimented the fire eaters, devil dancers and Kandyan drummers. The masters of ceremony, Sampath and Erandi lead the guests from dinner to dancing to competing in light hearted competitions, which included the Queen of the Night catwalk.
First prize was awarded to a Sri Lankan beauty with the opportunity to stay in Calamander Unawatuna Beach and Calamander Lake Gregory, with transport provided between the two hotels.
At one minute to midnight the countdown was announced and the guests and staff gathered by the beach to witness a spectacular display of fireworks and the launching of hot air lanterns into the night sky.
Hundred of lanterns, silhouetted against the moonlight, sailed towards the full moon. It was indeed a magical sight.
The bubbly flowed and the guests danced until dawn. In 2018, Calamander Unawatuna Beach, looks forward to another year of change and development and continued success, ensuring its future as the best beach resort down south.
