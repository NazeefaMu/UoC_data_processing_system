Literary Tourism: UNESCO cities of literature you might want to visit

In 2004 UNESCO started an initiative called Cities of Literature, in order to “promote the social, economic and cultural development of cities in both the developed and the developing world.”
Basically “Book cities”, right? We’re talking cities dedicated to books.
So far, most Cities of Literature are in Europe but the U.S. has one (just one!?) magnificent city that has earned the title. Before you scroll down, try to guess which city it is.
To become a City of Literature a city has to , among other things, score highly for:
So let’s take a look at some of the magnificent cities that have been Cities of Literature in the past (aka, your travel plans for the next years).
Granada, Spain
Granada is a grand old city in southern Spain. It is draped across the base of the Sierra Nevada mountains and sits there, chilling in the Spanish heat. Oh, it also has the Alhambra, an absolutely breathtaking palace-city, built and ransacked alternatively by Christians and Moors, now standing in grand old fashion over the city.
Reykjavik, Iceland
We’ve spoken about Reykjavik before here on Book Riot. Iceland has more books published per capita than any other country in the world (well, the Vatican actual does, but they don’t count as a proper country, right?), Christmas brings something called a “book flood” and there’s a surprising amount of bookstores for such a small country (total population is 330,000).
Iowa City, U.S.A.
Yup, the only city in the U.S. to be named a City of Literature is Iowa City, Iowa. Home of the Iowa Writers’ Workshop, whose graduates include John Irving and Flannery O’Connor, Iowa City also has a number of literature-themed festivals through the year, including the Iowa City Book Festival in October.
