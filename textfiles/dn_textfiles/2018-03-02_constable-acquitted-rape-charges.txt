Constable acquitted of rape charges

Panadura Provincial High Court Judge Dhamith Thotawatte acquitted Panadura Police Constable Waduge Padmasiri Fernando of charges against him regarding the rape of a young woman which took place on May 27, 2009.
The judge said on a complaint received by Wadduwa Police, officers had investigated and submitted a report to the Attorney General, who had then filed charges against Constable Fernando. However, the prosecution provided insufficient evidence against the defendant at the trial that followed. Hence, the accused was acquitted due to uncorroborated evidence on February 28.
State Counsel Gayani Wegodapola appeared for the prosecution, while Attorney-at-law Chanaka Amarasinghe defended the accused.
