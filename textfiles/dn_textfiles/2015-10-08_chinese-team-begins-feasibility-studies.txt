Construction of hospital to treat CKD patients
Chinese team begins feasibility studies


China’s Vice Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin meets President Maithripala Sirisena
A team sent by the Chinese government has commenced feasibility studies in Sri Lanka for the construction of what would be a fully facilitated hospital for the treatment of patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD).
Calling on President Maithripala Sirisena at the Presidential Secretariat yesterday, China's Vice Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin said the team sent by China is currently conducting a feasible analysis on the construction of the hospital.
China agreed to provide grant assistance to Sri Lanka to build a hospital to cater to kidney patients at the request of President Sirisena when he met Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing in March 2015.
The victims of the fast spreading CKD in the country are mostly farm workers or agriculture workers in the North Central and Uva provinces. The disease has spread to the Northwestern, Eastern, Southern and Central provinces, and some parts of the Northern province.
The victims are mostly men. Women and children becoming victims are also on the increase.
According to the World Health Organisation, more than 15 percent of the population aged between 15 and 70 in the North Central and Uva provinces are adversely affected by CKD.
Over 1,100 CKD patients are admitted to hospitals every month. Around 300 deaths are recorded every year on account of the disease.
Extensive use of agro-chemicals with high level of toxicity is said to to be the main cause behind the situation.
