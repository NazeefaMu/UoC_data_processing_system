Common policy on purchasing vehicles in next Budget - Eran

The Finance Minister will introduce a common policy on purchasing vehicles for ministries and ministers in the next Budget, State Enterprise Development Deputy Minister Eran Wickremaratne said.
Addressing a press conference at Sirikotha yesterday, Wickremaratne said the Finance Minister will come up with this policy after discussions with the President and the Prime Minister.
“Purchasing vehicles must be based on the requirements of each ministry. It should not depend on the Minister who holds the portfolio. At a time we are facing a disaster, we need to identify our priorities. I hope the new Finance Minister will do so,” he replied.
He said the Ministry Secretaries should be permanent in their positions and should be bound to carry on the Government policy despite who comes to power.
“We, politicians, take political decisions, but the public officials must take operational decisions. The bureaucracy needs to be efficient and knowledgeable,” he said.
