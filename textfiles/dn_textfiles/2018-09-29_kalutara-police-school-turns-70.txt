Kalutara Police School turns 70

The Kalutara Police School marks its 70th anniversary today. Although Police training facilities were established in 1905, it was only in 1948 that the Police School was established at its present premises under the leadership of SP Sydney de Soysa. The 193-acre Police School has all facilities needed for the training of all ranks of Police Officers. The facilities include physical training centres, firearms range, driving school, language school, canteens, recreational areas and residential quarters.
The School is headed by DIG Sanjeeva Dharmaratne and SP Anura Pushpakumara. The faculty is drawn from the Police and academia.
A 27-feet high Cetiya is being built at the Police school while a Kovil was opened recently. Further developments are being planned for the Police School.
