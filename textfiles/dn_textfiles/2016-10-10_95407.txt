Radwanska, Murray bag China Open titles

Beijing: Agnieszka Radwanska beat Johanna Konta in straight sets to take the title at the China Open in a chilly Beijing Sunday, denying the Briton her biggest career crown.
The third-ranked Pole -- who cruised through the tournament without dropping a set -- sealed her second title in Beijing with an ace for a 6-4, 6-2 win.
The victory was Radwanska's 20th career crown but there was more on the line for Konta, 25, who was making a bid in the Chinese capital for what would have been her second and biggest title.
Despite the loss, by reaching the Beijing final Konta has amassed enough points to break into the top 10 -- the first British woman to do so since Jo Durie in 1984.
When the new leaderboards are released Monday it will be the first time since computerised rankings were introduced that a British man (Andy Murray) and woman are ranked in the top 10 at the same time. Konta, usually a solid baseliner, repeatedly pushed to the net as she tried to shift the match momentum in her favour, but it was a risky strategy that cost her 29 unforced errors.
"Against a player like Agnieszka, who is basically a human wall, you definitely do try to look to get the upper hand in any way possible. I felt I was going to try on that avenue," Konta told reporters after the match.
After dropping her serve twice in each set, Konta made a bid to even the scoreline in the second, pushing Radwanska to two break points in the sixth game.
But the Pole -- nicknamed 'The Magician' for her ability to conjure up shots -- shot a forehand down the line to save her service game.
"Whenever I felt I could have got a little bit of a foothold in the match, she took it away from me," Konta said.
Konta held her next service game with a forehand dropshot which Radwanska redirected wide.
But the world number three then served for the title, firing her only ace of the match straight down the line for her third Premier Mandatory title, one rung down from a Grand Slam.
"I think that was a perfect timing," Radwanska said of the ace.
"I was thinking about that serve, where I should go. I just changed my mind when I was tossing the ball. So another good choice."
It was the second time the pair have met after Radwanska beat the Briton in a two-hour, three-set battle in Cincinnati in August.

Beijing: Andy Murray beat Grigor Dimitrov in straight sets to win the China Open on Sunday as he closes in on Novak Djokovic's number one ranking.
The world number two did not drop a set as he romped through the tournament to claim his fifth title of the year and 40th of his career with a 6-4, 7-6 (7/2) win.
The victory moves Murray 1,000 points closer to long-reigning world number one Djokovic, with the chance of taking the top spot by year-end. Murray broke Dimitrov's serve in the opening game of the match, putting the 15th-ranked Bulgarian on the defensive and pushing him to make 21 unforced errors in the opening set.
In the second set, both held their serve through the first four games until Murray broke Dimitrov at 3-2.
It looked like the Scot would serve for the championship but the unseeded Bulgarian won the next 11 points, breaking Murray to love.
Pushed to a tiebreak, the Scot immediately seized back control, taking the first point of the decider on Dimitrov's serve.
Murray stormed through the tiebreak, dropping just two points to claim his first title in the Chinese capital.
