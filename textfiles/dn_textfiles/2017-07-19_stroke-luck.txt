A stroke of luck

H. A. Sumudu, an 18-year-old resident of Muriyakadawela in Kekirawa, had a pleasant surprise after she bought a lottery ticket from Batapola.
After borrowing money from her sister who is a resident of the same area to buy the ticket, she returned to the ticket seller to claim Rs. 100 which she though she had won.
Sumudu was then informed by the seller that she had won Rs. 2.07 million instead, which she initially did not believe.
It was when Batapola Lotteries Board Agent Ajith Krishantha accompanied her to the Lotteries Board and deposited the money, did she realise her luck.
