Public duped by Gazette content: Acting Govt. Printer

The Acting Government Printer yesterday said the public has been put on the wrong track by the content included in the extraordinary gazette notification related to the Central Bank Bond issue.
“The gazette notification that was challenged was reserved to be printed on 01.01.2015. However, the Government Printer received the content of the gazette only on November 18, 2016,” the Acting Government Printer said.
Acting Government Printer Gangani Liyanage was testifying before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into the Issuance of Treasury Bonds.
The Acting Government Printer also answered in the affirmative when President’s Counsel, Additional Solicitor General Yasanta Kodagoda questioned her whether she agrees that the validity of a gazette has now dwindled due to the discrepancies in its issuance process.
The Presidential Commission also questioned if it is possible for the public to accept that information and announcements included in gazette notifications to be real time.
“Because anybody who reads this gazette at face level would believe all the information regarding the Treasury Bond issuance is of real time, but truly otherwise,” the Presidential Commission pointed out.
The said gazette notification in the gazette number 1895/19 issued on 01 January 2015 was recently challenged.
Supreme Court Justice Prasanna Jayawardane asked Liyanage whether it has been the general practice to back date and print a gazette.
Liyanage said it has been the case for a long period of time, and that she has information to prove so, on similar procedures until the year 2012.
Explaining the setting to the challenged gazette notification, Liyanage said even though a certain government institute reserves a date to print a gazette, the Government Printer receives the content for the gazette after a lapse of time from that the reservation has been made.
Justice Prasanna Jayawardane pointed out the Government Printer has not received the gazette content for more than a year.
PC Yasanta Kodagoda, who led the evidence, questioned Liyanage whether the Reading Room of the Government Printer, did not see the inconsistencies in the gazette.
“Yes, the Assistant Head Reader W.R.J. Mel pointed out to me the discrepancies that may occur if it was printed under the name of former Finance Minister. So I requested the said officer to inquire regarding this from the Central Bank of Sri Lanka,” Liyanage said.
Asked about what followed, Liyanage said a CBSL officer named Wasana, when inquired has told the Assistant Head Reader to go ahead with the printing since the date of the gazette says 01 January 2015.
PC Kodagoda also asked the Acting Government Printer as to why not a copy of an extraordinary gazette not be sent to the Department of the National Archives which records the historical details of the country.
PC Kodagoda also pointed out certain footnotes that appears in the gazette published in Sinhala does not appear in English or the Tamil versions.
The Presidential Commission pointed out, in the challenged gazette, there is a marking that appears in the first page foot note as G2457017 (2016/11).
The year and the month included in the brackets indicate the actual date on which the gazette has been printed, it was also pointed out.
Justice K.T. Chitrasiri questioned the Government Printer as to how a Tamil or an English reader could derive this important information, if it is not included in all three languages.
