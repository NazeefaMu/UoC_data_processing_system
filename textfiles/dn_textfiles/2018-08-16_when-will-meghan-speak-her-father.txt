When will Meghan  speak to her father?

Meghan Markle will not speak to her father Thomas until he makes contact in a ‘respectful manner’ and stops airing his grievances in public, DailyMail.com has learned.
The Duchess of Sussex, 37, has not spoken to Markle Sr since shortly after her wedding to Prince Harry in May when the royal, 33, allegedly berated the retiree for staging a series of fake photos with a Los Angeles-based paparazzi photographer.
Since then, the 74-year-old has gone on to give a series of interviews in which he claimed Meghan would be better off ‘if I was dead’ and said he had been cut off by Kensington Palace and has no way of contacting his youngest daughter.
But a close friend of the 37-year-old has now told DailyMail.com that Markle Sr does have a means of contacting Meghan – via her mother Doria Ragland, 62. The couple, who divorced when their daughter was six, have remained in touch and, shortly before the royal wedding in May, Markle Sr was seen delivering pots of Mother’s Day flowers to his ex-wife’s home in Los
Angeles, California.
‘The only reason Meghan hasn’t spoken to her father yet is because she’s yet to hear from him in a respectful manner,’ the source told DailyMail.com. ‘Thomas is speaking to the press more than he’s reached out and spoken to his own daughter.’
The friend added: ‘Despite Thomas’s claim that he has no way to reach Meghan, he knows that her mother Doria is in touch with her and Thomas knows how to reach Doria. ‘If Thomas truly wanted to speak with Meghan, he could easily have sent a letter to her mother and asked her to pass it along. ‘Unfortunately that wouldn’t sell papers or fit into his fabricated and salacious narrative.’
The pair have a history of rifts, as DailyMail.com has previously revealed, with Markle Sr claiming the latest one began because Meghan asked him to cut off contact with her half-sister Samantha.
Kensington Palace has been approached for comment by DailyMail.com. The new revelations come after Markle Sr gave another interview this past weekend to the Mail on Sunday in which he once again moaned about being unable to contact Meghan, claimed to have sent her two birthday cards, and admitted that he lied to Prince Harry about the paparazzi photos scandal.
He told the paper of the now-infamous pictures of him being measured for a suit: ‘I told him [Prince Harry] I was being measured for a new hoodie.’
Markle Sr also lashed out at the Prince for remonstrating with him over the photo scandal while he was allegedly lying in his hospital bed recovering from a heart attack in San Diego, and described the timing of the call as ‘rude’.
The septuagenarian then went on to speak of his hurt over not receiving a wedding invitation to frame and revealed that he was upset that Meghan had decided not to let him make a speech at her wedding.
