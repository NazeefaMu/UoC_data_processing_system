CB officials refraining from providing documents to COPE
Speaker to look into issue
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said in Parliament yesterday that he would look into the incident of Central Bank officials deliberately refraining from procuring certain documents to the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE).
The Speaker made this observation in response to a point of order raised by Joint Opposition member MP Mahindananda Alutgamage.
MP Alutgamage said some Central Bank Officials in the Presidential Commission on the Bond Issue had accepted that they refrained from procuring several documents on the issue before the COPE. But the control on the public finance is vested in Parliament.
“The Speaker should look into the matter without delay since this is a bad precedent. Public officials would refrain from providing documents to the COPE,” Alutgamage said.
“We should find out on whose instruction officials refrained from procuring documents to the COPE,” he said.
The Speaker said he would look into the matter.
Ravi’s or MR’s signature not on Gazette on Treasury Bonds
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake or former Finance Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa has not placed their signatures for the controversial Gazette dated January 1, 2015 on the issuance of Treasury bonds, Parliament was told yesterday.
Minister Karunanayake, moving two Orders under the Excise (Special Provisions) Act for debate, said the Extraordinary Gazette Notification No. 1895/19 was not referred to the Finance Ministry in contrary to the standard practice. It had been signed by the Public Debt Superintendent and sent to the Government Printer, he said.
Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake questioned the credibility of Government Gazettes published under the names of Ministers when they claim they did not sign them.
The Finance Minister also challenged former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to go before court challenging the gazette dated January 1, 2015, stating that the truth would come out when the case is taken up.
“We followed the tradition set by ‘Rajapaksa, Ajith Nivard Cabraal and P. B. Jayasundara since 2005 when issuing this Gazette. They are the pioneers of this tradition. Former President Rajapaksa had placed his signature to a similar gazette in December 31, 2012, but from 2013 to 2015, the Central Bank had Gazetted them without the signature of the Finance Minister,” he said.
Minister Karunanayake said out of the Rs. 7.8 trillion bonds issued from 2005- January 8, 2015, 80.8 percent were issued on private placement.
“These were shared among three or four individuals. About 68 percent of these private placements went to three institutions, as 33 percent to Commercial Bank, 17 percent to Hatton National Bank and 18 percent to Seylan Bank,” he said. The minister said it was due to these frauds, the Prime Minister insisted on public auction instead of private placement.
He said strict laws are needed to manage non-banking financial institutions in the country as they have faced a risky situation due to the previous government’s mismanagement of the sector.
“The former government has permitted to start 54 such institutions whereas the country needed 15-20 such institutions,” he said.

JO quizzes on alleged false press release
by Finance Ministry
The Joint Opposition yesterday questioned on the alleged false press release issued by the Finance Ministry on the gazette notification with regard to bond issue on January 15, 2015 which the Secretary was not aware of.
Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardene making a statement under standing order 23(2) said the Secretary to the Finance Ministry has told the Presidential Commission investigating into the bond issue that he was not aware of the press release though it has been issued with his seal.
“According to a newspaper report, the Finance Ministry Secretary has told the presidential commission that he was not aware of the press release and that many releases were issued to the media without his knowledge,” MP Gunawardena said.
“This is a serious issue. The Ministry Secretary accepted that the press release had been issued by Finance Minister’s Media Secretary Sisira Wijesinghe,” he said.
“This is a release by the Finance Minister’s Media Secretary to make malicious allegations against the former President and the then Central Bank Governor,” MP Gunawardena said.
“The Finance Minister has misled the nation. He should be removed from the post,” he said.
Leader of the House and Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe would make a statentment today on the issue.
He said it is not acceptable that a senior MP like Gunawardene talk of the investigations carried out by the Presidential commission in Parliament as the investigation is in progress. “This is not fair by MP Gunawardena as he is in Parliament since 1983,” Minister Kiriella said.
However, a tense situation erupted when several members wanted to express their views and Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said that he could not allow to make the point a matter of debate. He said nobody can order him to give the mike.
