Panel to recommend measures to minimize natural disaster impacts

Cabinet this week established a panel of intellectuals to look into the management of impacts of natural disasters, as ministers discussed plans of action to deal with reconstruction, compensation and disaster risk preparedness in the wake of landslides and floods which wreaked havoc in the country recently.
The panel, proposed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, is to recommend short and long term measures through which the impact of natural disasters in the country can be minimized.
Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa had also proposed that Cabinet adopt as a national policy to empower District Secretariats to act independently and take immediate and necessary action in relief operations and to bear necessary expenses in times of disaster.
The government estimates that rehabilitation and rebuilding of properties damaged due to natural disasters would cost Rs 50-60 billion- close to 0.5 percent of GDP.
Thus, Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera has proposed that the projects proposed in the 2017 Budget be reviewed and to identify their relevant priorities so that funds from less important projects can be utilized for reconstruction work. In addition, the Treasury is also to divert part of the allocations for Supplementary Assistant Services and Emergency Requirements to rebuilding work.
The Education Ministry in the meantime has decided to rebuild or relocate 472 schools (Southern Province- 182, Western Province- 177, Sabaragamuwa- 112 and Nuwara Eliya -1). The Ministry would rehabilitate necessary facilities including furniture, library, laboratories and sports items. In addition, they are expected to give three sets of uniforms and a pair of shoes for each student affected by the recent landslides and floods.
Compensation for Meethotamulla victims were also discussed in Cabinet this week with compensation granted to the deceased victims approved for Rs 1 million. Close to 393 families and 1,670 people were affected due to the collapse of the garbage dump with 60 houses completely damaged and 27 partially damaged.
