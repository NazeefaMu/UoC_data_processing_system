Akurana School lacks teachers

Educational activities at the Akurana Aswer National School in the Katugasthota educational zone have been obstructed due to shortage of teachers, members of the School Development Society said.
The school needs at least 28 teachers to streamline its tutorial activities and the Society has deployed a small batch of voluntary teachers to tide over the situation. They expect the attention of the relevant authorities to solve this issue.
