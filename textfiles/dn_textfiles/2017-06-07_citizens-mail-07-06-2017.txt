Terms that define social justice
Justice in terms of the distribution of wealth, opportunities, and privileges within a society is social justice.
Social justice is based on the concepts of human rights and equality and can be defined as the way in which human rights are manifested in everyday lives of people at every level of society.
Social justice is the fair and just relation between the individual and society.
Social justice is the fair and proper administration of laws conforming to the natural law that all persons irrespective of ethnic origin, gender, possessions, race, etc are to be treated equally without prejudice.
Social justice is the idea that all members of society deserve an equal footing in terms of opportunities, political rights, and distribution of wealth, privileges so that they can lead fulfilling lives and realize their potential in the community.
Social justice can also be defined as promoting a just society by challenging injustice and valuing diversity. It exists when all people share a common humanity and therefore have a right to equitable treatment, support for their human rights, and a fair allocation of resources.
We should have the courage to raise our voices against injustice. As Sri Lankans we must get up and see what are the injustices in our society. See the luxury lives of our leaders. See the standard of living of our poor people. Is there equal treatment? Compare the difference.
Are we treating all people equally? Are not there people enjoying unfair privileges?
Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.
Fight every injustice.
If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor.
Keep calm and fight injustice.
You have the power to fight injustice.
