Former Navy Spokesman Commodore D.K.P Dassanayake and five others who were held in remand custody on the charge of aiding and abetting the abduction and disappearance of 11 youths in 2008 and 2009 were ordered to be released under strict bail conditions by Colombo High Court, today.Each suspect was ordered to be released on a cash bail of Rs.100,000 with three sureties of one million rupees.
They were severely warned not to interfere with witnesses in case further ordered to appear before CID on every Saturday.The Colombo High Judge Manilal Waidyatilleke made this order after taking into consideration a revision application filed by suspects challenging Colombo Fort Magistrate's decision to reject bail on the suspects on several occasions.
