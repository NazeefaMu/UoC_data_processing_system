Escape into Albert Museum

The Victoria and Albert Museum popularly know as V & A and contain some of the richest and priceless artefacts and their kind along with paintings mainly by British painters but with originals of others. It was established in 1852 to make works of art available to all and inspire British designers and gained its current name in 1899 when Queen Victoria laid the foundation stone of a new wing and renamed the Museum in memory of her husband, Prince Albert.
Spanning over two thousand years of human creativity, the Museum's rich and diverse collections, virtually every medium and from many parts of the world are represented. These collections are often subject to renewal and restoration for better preservation while the Victorian interiors are both beautiful and stimulating. It is an artist's paradise.
The Galleries of art and design are arranged by place or date and explore the relationship between objects from similar periods, regions and placed in their historical context. V & A's collections of Medieval and Renaissance art are among the most important in the world.
Some of the most exciting elements of the V & A are on and off are programmed to coincide with exhibitions and galleries are transformed into catwalks to display them. Through the strength of its collection and exhibitions, the creativity of modern artists finds a unique with the past and their historical predecessors.
IRONWORK
The Hereford screen that spans one of the galleries was a gigantic art work undertaken by Sir George Gilbert Scott in 1862. It was painted, wrought and cast iron, brass and copper with mosaic and hardstones mixing accordingly. This was a screen that divided the nave from the chancel, the clergy from the congregation that was an essential element of every medieval church but after the Reformation, many screens were ripped off until the arrival of the Gothic Revival of the nineteenth century where some were reinstated. Although Sir George Gilbert was a passionate admirer of the Gothic style, he decided to use iron for his screen at V & A and not the usual wood or stone. The screen was exhibition before finding its permanent place in Hereford Cathedral. Critics praised it as grandest, most triumphant achievement of modern architecture. However, with changing time and onto the 1960s, the screen fell victim to anti-Victorian prejudice and among strong protests, it was dismantled and sold to the Herbert Museum in Coventry, which could not at that time house it. Eventually, in 1983 it was given to V & A and arrived in 14000 thousand, broken, rustling and flaking. The reconstruction work took over a year that turned out to be yet another triumph of modern conservation and bears testimony to Sir George Gilbert Scott's spectacular creativity.
ARCHITECTURE
No one going to Sydney will miss its Sydney Opera House not because it is the major landmark but for its heavenly interior that has become a class of its own, worldwide. How it came to be is itself a triumph for humanity and leading that dream was Jorn Utzon who won the Sydney Opera House competition in 1957 when no one knew how to build the roof structure he had designed. Utzon's concept showed huge billowing shells resting on narrow points but the engineer, Ove Arup had seen immediately that the shells would not sustain the forces they would generate. He found them irregular and could not be defined mathematically. Also, Prefabrication and calculation were both impossible.
Discouraged poor Utzon nearly cried and resigned to himself and said, 'We had precedent to go on. It was like climbing Mount Everest for the first time. Three years later, Utzon was in for a shock when the work on the site had already started. He found the solution - in an orange. By cutting ' spherical triangles' from the skin, he discovered a regular basis for the irregular forms he wished to create. To develop his idea further, he made a wooden model. (Three such wooden models are carried along with this article) Arup was able to design a structure in which a framework of pre - fabricated, tapering ribs of identical curvature could support a thin skin. The idea of frameless shells had been lost, but Utzon's vision was now realised.
THE ASIAN DREAM
Nothing much to crow about though V & A has an outstanding collection of Asian art displaying from East Asia while those from South and South East are at the opposite end of the main corridor near the Raphael Gallery. Art from East Asia and the Islamic world can also be seen in some of the material and techniques such as ceramic, glass and textiles. Yet the lack of African art never been comprehensively collected for display.
Where was Sri Lanka? My eyes scrutinised all on display in the Asian galleries and never found anything of India.
Maybe I missed some. Fairly disappointed, I made it to the exit when I saw in a corner, upon a pedestal stood the mighty Sri Lankan elephant in all his majesty, studded and decorated with precious Sri Lankan gems that revealed our culture and historical significance That completed my day at the V & A Museum.
