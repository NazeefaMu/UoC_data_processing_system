Residents in Mawenella seek water

Over 5,000 families in Mawanella, Aluthnuwara do not receive water from the National Water Supply and Drainage Board. They staged a protest on October 10 demanding water and the Water Board officials of Mawenella promised them on the day that they will be provided with water as soon as possible but the issue was not resolved to date.
The families say they have to abandon their houses since they do not have water. Residents in many areas including Aluthnuwara, Manikawatta, Gallalla, Buluwa, Wettawa, Welekade, Kakirigoda and Idampitiya undergo untold hardships without water.
They have been without water from the Board for over two years now. Members of the Mawenella Pradeshiya Sabha have submitted the issue to the Sabha on several occasions but the problem still remains.
They urge authorities to address the issue fast.
