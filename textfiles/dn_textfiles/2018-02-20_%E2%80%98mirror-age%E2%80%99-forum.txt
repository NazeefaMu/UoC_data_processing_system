East Germany is a theatre paradise. Sixty state subsidized theatres played for a potential 16 million spectators and the artists, with life contracts, enjoyed a social security that artists in other countries only dream of. Moreover, the prestigious theatrical tradition in the GDR, founded on Bertolt Brecht's political and aesthetic concept of a
"Theatre of the New Age", lent the productions their distinctive profile and mounded productions from the highest artistic level.
The socialist state be jeweled itself with its theatre culture but it also upheld the doctrine that art was not just a commodity but a human right.
Theatre makers in the GDR were determined to make the most of their allotted roles. But the more the state instigated gap between reality and the ideal widened, the more the theatre found itself caught in a conflict between fellow-travelling and opposition.
In recent years, the theatre in the GDR assumed the role of "the conscience of the nation", an unusual role which it took on with responsibility and played with strength. The theatre that Brecht had enjoyed "to change the world", now took his instruction at its word.
