The event is jointly organized by the Royal College Basketball Advisory and Management Committee and the Gateway College Basketball Committee.
This encounter will be a first of its kind where Sri Lanka's leading national school and one of the oldest in the country, and a premier international school and one of the youngest in the island will join hands to lay an excellent platform for students with diverse values, cultures and backgrounds to bond together in healthy rivalry and comradeship.
In order to take basketball to the next level in the country Royal College and Gateway College have joined hands to conduct an annual encounter which is a popular concept in Sri Lanka to make basketball a spectator sport.
The annual encounter will be played for the ‘Alles-Gunasekara’ Cup named after two key personalities connected to the two schools. Late R I T Alles, commenced his journey as a teacher of Royal College where he served for over 10 years. Alles did yeoman service to the country as the founder Principal of D S Senanayake College and later as the State Secretary of Education. Remembered by many as one of the finest educators, the country has produced, Alles is also the founder of Gateway College.
Late E Christie Gunasekara, a Royalist himself was a long standing vice principal of Royal College and former president of the Sri Lanka Schools Basketball Association who is respected for his unrelenting commitment to uplift discipline and standards of Royal College during his day
Both schools are keen to make this a unique encounter by introducing a new culture with rich traditions that would include activities for spectator engagement and a joint follow-up social welfare program. Due attention will be paid to upcoming talent by including an under 15 match before the main under 19 encounter.
The girls’ invitation under 19 game between Gateway College and Ladies College will add colour and diversity to the encounter.
The Royal team captained by Heshan Meethalawa has been playing together from their under 15 days. Several players in the team were in the under 20 National School winning team while some of the team members played for the under 18 National 3x3 Youth Basketball Team.
