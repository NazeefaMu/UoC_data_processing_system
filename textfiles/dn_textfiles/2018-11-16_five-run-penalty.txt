THAT FIVE-RUN PENALTY

At a time when Sri Lanka were struggling to gain a first innings lead they conceded five penalty runs to England which was added to their first innings total making it 290. The incident happened in the 85th over when Roshen Silva failed to ground his bat at the non-strikers’ end after hitting the ball to third man. Silva may have thought the ball had gone for four but it was fielded by Moeen Ali. The umpire Marais Erasmus of South Africa noticing that Silva had not grounded his bat running the first run and had turned back for the second immediately signalled one short to the scorers, but on second thought after consulting his colleague S Ravi of India he changed his mind and signalled dead ball and awarded England five penalty runs that was added to their first innings which was changed from 285 to 290.
The Law states: Five penalty points are awarded to the fielding side if the batting team: Attempts to steal a run or deliberately run short.

18.5.1 If either umpire considers that one or both batsmen deliberately ran short at that umpire's end, the umpire concerned shall, when the ball is dead, call and signal Short run and inform the other umpire of what has occurred and apply 18.5.2.
18.5.2 The bowler's end umpire shall - disallow all runs to the batting side - return any not out batsman to his/her original end - signal No ball or Wide to the scorers, if applicable - award 5 Penalty runs to the fielding side - inform the scorers as to the number of runs to be recorded - inform the captain of the fielding side and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of the reason for this action.
