For the sake of State

The state has a long history of involvement in the economy in Sri Lanka; state ownership of utilities dates back to the colonial era. Post independence experiments with socialism saw the expansion of the state into many new areas of business. Despite some reforms in the 1977-2005 era state enterprises still account for a significant share of the economy. The 2005-2015 period saw a halt to the privatisation process and a renewed wave of expansion in state businesses.
Between 2009 and 2015 the number of State Owned Enterprises (SOE)s grew from 107 to 245 while the number employed grew from 140,500 to a staggering 237,811.
State involvement in the economy seems to be taken for granted, but should it be so?
The Department of Public Enterprises is supposed to monitor governance in Public Enterprises (Commercial Corporations, Government Owned Companies and Statutory Boards), but by its own admission only 55 of SOE's come under its purview. The last available performance report (2015) indicates that the 55 SOE's considered strategically important obtained budgetary support of Rs.95bn with a further Rs.19bn being granted for restructuring, a vast sum but an improvement from the Rs126bn granted the year before.
Economic efficiency
Bank borrowings by these SOE's stood at Rs.658bn as at end 2015, up from Rs.471.2bn as at end 2014. The size of the SOE's and the breadth of their activity make it an important determinant of the overall productivity of the economy. Consequently, the governance of SOEs is critical to ensure their positive contribution to a country’s overall economic efficiency and competitiveness.
This extremely difficult due to certain inherent problems in the structure of ownership.
1) Governments are run by politicians, not businessmen. Politicians can only make political decisions, not economic ones and these decisions will tend to be focused on short term publicity and benefits, ignoring long term consequences. An example is the launch of a company called Polipto Lanka to convert rubber and polythene waste to diesel. It was launched in 2009 amidst much fanfare but despite regular grants from the treasury has yet to show any commercial results or even demonstrate that the process is economically feasible. Coincidentally, the launch took place a week before a general election. Polipto receives regular budget support from the Treasury, support for the last three years amounted to Rs.120m.
2) Governments use other people's money, businesses must risk their own money. If a business does not earn a profit, the owner will need to keep infusing funds and this provides a powerful incentive to improve efficiency. The general public, whose money is effectively at risk in a state venture do not have the wherewithal or knowledge to hold managers or politicians to account. Politicians would prefer to postpone hard decisions than risk personal unpopularity, which is why state enterprises can keep running losses year after year. The JEDB and SLSPC have not reported a profit in the last five years, Mihin Lanka never made a profit since its inception, yet they continue to operate, the losses being paid by taxpayers because politicians will not risk bad publicity that may follow any attempts to reform them.
The Director General of Public Enterprises admitted as much in his report of 2009:
“We have found some boards take affairs of the enterprise very lightly regardless of their strategic importance even in a situation where PE [Public Enterprise] faces very difficult time. Since there is no formal procedure to hold the chairman and the board of directors accountable, for their weak performance or unacceptable practices, some boards act with sheer indifference in discharging their responsibility.”
3) State enterprises tend to be monopolies or restrict competition from the private sector. A business that faces no competition will find it easier to report profits. Where state businesses face competition the Government may grant SOE's preferential tax or other benefits that hinder the ability of the private sector to compete, causing a deterioration in service or increasing costs to consumers. A few years ago VAT was imposed on large supermarkets but LakSathosa was exempted from this. The previously unprofitable LakSathosa started to make profits, while the efficient local supermarkets which were penalised.
SOE's which operate as monopolies may not deliver an adequate level of service or charge excessive prices, which may lower the productivity/efficiency of the wider economy. When telecoms were in state hands obtaining a telephone connection, essential for business, was a luxury that required a wait of several years. Thanks to liberalisation phone connections are available over the counter but businesses still struggle to obtain power connection and may have to invest in standby generators due to unreliability. Energy costs (fuel and electricity) do not reflect the decline in global oil prices partly due to inefficiencies within the CPC/CEB, impacting on the competitiveness of business.
Inefficiencies in the state managed port terminals are a drag on trade but fortunately throughput at the privately managed SAGT Queen Elizabeth Quay is far greater and a boon to business. The SAGT terminal has been ranked number one for terminal productivity in South Asia by the Journal of Commerce in the USA, and ranked it number 4 in the world. Because of the faster turnaround time the ships prefer to dock the Port the Queen Elisabeth Quay.
SOE's, especially those that lose money are partly funded by banks. When a large chunk of bank lending is directed towards SOE's, the private sector will find funds harder to obtain and the interest rates higher, a phenomenon referred to as “crowding out”.
4) Governments cannot boost overall employment by hiring workers for the state sector. Giving people state-sector jobs may appear to create employment but this causes a problem because each new position brings with it a tax obligation that imposes a burden on the private sector, where wealth is generated and taxes paid. Effectively, since the salary of a public-sector employee reduces the amount of funds available to private employers, a job created in the public sector causes an offsetting loss in the private sector.
5) State-owned enterprises may enjoy hidden subsidies in a variety of forms including preferential borrowing costs, lower rents or taxes. Thus the actual costs will be higher than reported in the accounts and very difficult to quantify without detailed analysis.
For example, imagine if ministries or SOE's had to pay market rents for the space in Government buildings that they utilise. Few would occupy the highly-valued areas they do now and would probably occupy less office space.
State-owned property
Indeed, there is a massive opportunity cost of state-owned property in that they do not generate a net tax income for the state. If these properties were utilised by the private sector they would generate taxes as well as rents. Second, government office buildings in city centres create additional congestion. Given the current state of information technology, most government offices could and should be moved far from city centres.
It is important to note that these are structural problems inherent to all SOE’s and are independent of the party in power. Losses in SOE’s are a problem but their inefficiencies can have an even more serious impact on the wider economy.
More worrying to the public is the fact that the full extent of the problem is unknown. The Treasury and other bodies supposed to monitor SOE’s do so only partially, and, by all accounts ineffectually. How much of public resources are being drained away in this financial black hole?
Tax payers and citizens surely deserve better?
