‘A TALL TALE’: Former BoI Chairman Upul Jayasuriya responds.....

The following is former Board of Investment Chairman Upul Jayasuriya's response to the Daily News article on July 11, 2017 about the agreement between the BOI and Al Aman World Capital Centre.
The Daily News is withholding comment because Mr. Jayasuriya has since resigned.
"Application was received by the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka (BOI).
The summary of the proposed project as stated in the Application is as follows:-
World Capital Centre will stand the tallest among other infrastructural marvels in Sri Lanka gracing a height of 625 meters and consisting of 117 floors as major mixed development project.
Proposed project will be located within the commercial capital of Sri Lanka.
The building will house a hotel, business center, luxury residential and service apartments, leisure and recreational areas.
Based on the Board paper submitted by the Executive Director (Investment Promotion) through the Director General of the BOI, the Board approved in principle, the investment proposal by the name "World Capital Centre" funded by the TU - E Capital Lanka (Pvt) Ltd., valued at US $ 2.4 Billion to be invested over a period of six years, which will in its entirety consist of Foreign Investment.
The Investor having deposited an initial sum of US $ 2 million in a State Bank designated for the proposed investment project, the BOI entered into a preliminary Agreement incorporating and imposing a number of conditions was executed with Al-Aman World Capital Centre Limited.
The said conditions included in the said agreement are as follows:
 
1. " Para 6; The agreement is subject to the condition inter alia that the Enterprise shall acquire good title to / good leasehold interest in the land / site and submit a copy of the title deed / instrument of lease as the case may be, to the Board within three (03) months from the date hereof.
2. .....The enterprise shall enter into a supplementary agreement having obtained the necessary approval and / clearances referred to in Clause (13) of this Agreement and until such time the Enterprise shall not be entitled to duty free imports referred to in sub clause (iv) of Clause (11) hereof, under this agreement.
 
3. .....Failure to comply with the above shall invalidate the Agreement and this agreement shall thereupon absolutely be determined and the Enterprise shall forfeit all amounts paid to the Board.
 
4. " para 7(11); ......... Presales advances collected from the buyers shall not be considered as a part of the investment in the determination of concessions granted by the Board.
 
5. ...... 7(111) in order to assure the commitment towards implementing the project, the enterprise shall require to remit United States Dollars Two Hundred Million (US$ 200 Million) to Sri Lanka on or before the 31st December 2017. However, in the event that such remittance is not made as stipulated herein, the project shall stand terminated ipso facto."
 
6. This project will not be entitled for any Tax concession as at date and the provisions of the Inland Revenue Law shall be applicable to the enterprise in respect of the profits and the income generated through the approved activities.
The investor in order to proceed with the proposed investment project is required to fulfill all of the above conditions.
Failure to comply with the said conditions will in effect render the said Agreement null and void.
There was no commitment on the part of the BOI in the procurement of the land.
The BOI is the principle agency mandated to promote and facilitate FDI as empowered under the BOI Act of 1978.
We as a country and the BOI have to be positive.
We are not a regulatory authority. It is the role of the BOI to attract and facilitate investments as empowered by the BOI Law.
There are however other regulatory bodies in the system of governance that have been established to play such a regulatory role. In an instance where the prospective investor expresses an interest to invest in Sri Lanka, it is the duty of the BOI to do its utmost to facilitate such an investment.
We cannot afford to take a negative attitude. Given the challenging global environment where we are place 110 out of 190 countries as per the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Index, it is a challenge to attract investment, particularly when no tax concessions are offered while all the countries competing for the FDI in this region continue to offer such incentives.
By the execution of this agreement, neither the BOI not the country has been disadvantaged by any means.The company is not placed in an advantageous position either.
However skepticism that has been created would not only jeopardise this investment, but also have a negative impact on other prospective investments."
