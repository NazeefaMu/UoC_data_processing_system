The walk to democracy

How do people counter anti democratic tendencies of a government is a problem faced even by the American people. Already many admit that there is a dangerously anti-democratic, even authoritarian impulse at the centre of the Trump administration. Of course this kind of attacks on democracy has happened before. In other times and other places, authoritarian leaders have come to power through the manipulation of democratic institutions, often by exploiting major divisions within the general electorate.
Nationality and communal divisions are always exploited by fascistic politicians even in modern societies. Even though they come to power in quasi-democratic manner, as both Mahinda and Trump already have done, such figures cleverly recognize that they will not be able to maintain the broad-based support needed to remain in power, or accomplish anything while there. As such they work to undermine the basic institutions of democracy, such as independent commissions, for the judiciary, the administration, police and other sections of state power. In addition they always make it a point to attack the free press.
Radical political groups
The breakdown of such societies has been the subject of study for social scientists in the recent past. They have concentrated on societies run by dictators and fascistic leaders. In Lanka mass mobilization which included trade unions, left parties and radical political groups, non government social organisations and radical Buddhist and Christian monks became the instrument of change.
Strong authoritarian regimes
There were strikes and demonstrations by workers but the political leadership came from the radical inelegancia. In that sense it was a middle class revolution. Some say different circumstances led to this variation in outcome when compared to Arab Spring. A variety of causal factors have been highlighted, most of which hinge on the relationship between the strength of the state and the strength of civil society. Countries with stronger civil society networks in various forms underwent more successful reforms during the Arab Spring; these findings are also consistent with more general social science theories introduced in the recent history.
Also crucial was the degree of state censorship over print, broadcast, and social media in different countries. Television coverage by channels like Al Jazeera and BBC News provided worldwide exposure and prevented mass violence by the Egyptian government in Tahrir Square, contributing to the change made by the Egyptian ‘Revolution’.
In other countries, such as Libya, Bahrain, and Syria, such international press coverage was not present to the same degree, and the governments of these countries were able to act more freely in suppressing the protests.
This restriction combined with mistakes of leaders of the revolt led to strong authoritarian regimes with high degrees of censorship. Thus their national broadcast media were able to block communication and prevent the domestic spread of information necessary for successful protests. Morocco is a case in point, as its broadcast media at the time of the revolts was owned and operated almost exclusively by political elites with ties to the monarchy.
State control over media
Countries with greater access to social media, such as Tunisia and Egypt, proved more effective in mobilizing large groups of people, and appear to have been more successful overall than those with greater state control over media. Even though a revolution did take place and the prior government has been replaced, Tunisia's change is not yet over. There are still many grievances taking place; even today. Lankan democratic uprising was very closely connected to oppositional media and free social media.
Even today media play a strong role to mobilize protest against corruption, political intimidation and injustice. The presence of a strong, educated middle class has been noted as a correlate to the success of the Arab Spring in different countries.
This shows the bourgeoisie nature of the uprising and in countries where workers movement is technically absent revolution stopped half way. Countries with strong welfare programmes and a weak middle class, such as Saudi Arabia and Jordan, as well as countries with great economic disparity and an impoverished working class—including Yemen, Libya, and Morocco—did not experience successful revolutions. Hence they say to begin a political revolution presence of an educated middle class with free media is almost vital.
The strength of the middle class is, in turn, directly connected to the existing political, economic, and educational institutions in a country. Hence it can be argued that the middle class itself may be considered an informal political institution.
The history of Lanka proved again that slide from democracy to authoritarianism is downhill, and it is easier to stop a slide than to reverse one. Whether anti-democratic tendencies become full-fledged authoritarianism depends in no small part on what the general population does, and when and how they do it.
The authority generally watches the active middle class. If militant petty bourgeoisie act quickly enough, affirming their willingness to stand up and resist, the downward slide can be halted. Authority will be reversed. Mass protests may break out throughout the country with workers joining the struggle of democracy. In Lanka workers joined the struggle for democracy; but they have yet to say the final word.
