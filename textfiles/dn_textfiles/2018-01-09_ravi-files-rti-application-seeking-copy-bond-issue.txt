Ravi files RTI application  seeking copy of Bond issue

Former Minister Ravi Karunanayake yesterday filed an RTI application at the Presidential Secretariat to get a copy of the report of Presidential Commission of Inquiry on the Bond issue.
The former minister, speaking to the media outside the Secretariat, insisted on fast-paced investigations on the MiG aircraft deal, hedging deal, Greek Bond issue and loss of SriLankan Airlines. He said some were trying to bring disrepute to him, the UNP, and the party leadership using the Bond issue.
“The UNP is targeted in an unfair manner during an election period. I have been engaged in politics for 25 years. We do politics with the people and our hands are clean. You may assassinate me, but please do not assassinate my character,” Karunanayake said refuting allegations made against him on the Bond issue and allegedly giving false evidence.
He also reiterated that the Central Bank and Commercial Banks were not under him at the time the Bond transaction happened.
“It is our Government that made the Right to Information Act a reality and introduced a new political culture. I have sought a copy of the report under the RTI Act as some elements and the media have leveled allegations against me quoting the Bond Commission report. I will aptly reply after reading the report,” Karunanayake added.
The Bond Commission report was handed over to the President on December 30.
