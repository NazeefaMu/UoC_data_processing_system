GOODNESS GRACIOUS SOPHIA LOREN!

Sophia Loren’s mother is Romilda Villani and her Father is Ricardo Scicolone. Her Grandma is Luisa. They were Italians and more conversant in the French Language, Sophia was brought up under Luisa than her own mother. She taught her how to move in society, etiquettes and all good manners. Mostly playing the piano.
Sophia was born on September 20, 1934.
When she was a teenager, MGM Studio was looking for an actress with the resemblance of the famous actress Greta Garbo, the famous movie star at that time. Sophia was given many tests and was selected to take part in minor roles. She was invited to go to America, to Holywood, but her mum did not allow her as they thought America is on the other part of the world. She was recognised in her teens at the Cinecitta studio in Rome.
Evasive father
During the courting period of Sophia’s mum and Ricardo, Sophia was conceived. When this was announced, Ricardo did not want to marry Romilda and he evaded her. But with Luisa’s interference, Sophia was given the surname Scicolone, which was agreed by Ricardo just unwillingly. After the birth of Sophia Ricardo stayed with the wife about a week, but as Ricardo’s mother refused to accept Romilda as their daughter-in-Law, Ricardo left. Then Romilda and Sophia were deserted and Lucia lovingly opened doors for the baby and the daughter. Then Romilda started earning by washing plates in houses and hotels and Lucia earned by piano lessons to keep their home fires burning. Lucia, when the penniless and husbandless mother and the infant entered the house, opened a bottle of brandy, poured into three fancy glasses and said cheers to the newborn.
After few weeks the Grandma felt that Romilda did not have enough milk to feed, called Zaranella (a famous milk producer) to provide milk to the infant on the promise that beef will not be sold by the family after killing the cows and the bulls. Then the infant was down with a heavy cough, and the doctor instructed that they must leave the busy city and live in the mountain area where the child gets fresh air. The moving did the child good and her growth developed.
Due to insufficient funds Romilda, went to meet her unwedded husband Riccardo who welcomed her and spent days enjoying outings. One fine day, Romilda complained to her mum that she was pregnant again by Riccardo. This time Riccardo refused to give his surname to the second child. She was born in 1938 and her name was Maria Villani. She refused to attend school due to the humiliation thrust upon her for having a blank in the section where the Father’s name should depict in the Birth Certificate.
Sophia being a child with no love properly from the mum, and no dad around, became backwards and shy in school. Due to the economic crisis at home, she was very thin and her nickname was Toothpick.
Dangerous ammunitions
Problems arose when the war broke in the city, Rome. The Germans invaded Rome and their houses and everything got destroyed by bombs. Earlier Sophia thought when a rain of explosives fell from the sky, it was a fire display during a church festival. Little did she realise after the bombs destroying their buildings, hospitals, churches and all that they are dangerous ammunitions.
The Government asked everybody to creep into nearby caves and tunnels when the siren rings. So it was a case of running to the tunnels about 10 – 15 times a day which was a frightful flee. In the nights they slept in the tunnels, there was disturbance with mice and cockroaches.
Also, each time when they hear a train, they had to run out from the tunnel. Many things took place inside the tunnel. Women gave birth to babies, ladies cooked rice in the darkness, men were gambling, quarrels and fights, robberies but all had to live inside the tunnel as there was no other remedy.
