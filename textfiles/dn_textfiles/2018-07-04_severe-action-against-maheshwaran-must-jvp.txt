Severe action against Maheshwaran, a must - JVP

JVP yesterday, urged Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and the Government to take action against State Minister Vijayakala Maheshwaran concerning her controversial speech made recently on the necessity of the LTTE’s return.
At a press brief held at the Parliament premises yesterday evening, the JVP urged Speaker Jayasuriya to call upon the Parliament Privileges Committee to investigate into the matter.
JVP MP Vijitha Herath said that his party vehemently denounces the statement made by Deputy Minister Maheshwaran. He also demanded Deputy Minister Maheshwaran to apologize to the nation for uttering such a statement.
“This situation cannot be gone unpunished. It would set a wrong example if it was not checked right now. As parliamentarians, we are bound by an oath never to support the separating of this country directly or indirectly. Maheswaran, with her statement, has violated that oath by calling the LTTE to return back. This is very disgusting and a violation of the Constitution as well. Therefore, we urge both the Speaker and the Government to take necessary action against her according to the Law,” MP Herath said.
“We have all suffered due to the LTTE and calling for the revival of a terrorist outfit was unconstitutional and against the oath she had taken as an MP. The Speaker should refer the matter to the Privileges Committee and hold an inquiry against the deputy minister. If she is found guilty, she should then be removed from the post of MP,” he further added.
MP Herath also demanded the government’s stand point over the matter as the statement was made in the presence of External Affairs Minister and the Internal Affairs Minister.
MP Herath said that there was an anarchy prevailing in the country owing to the increased underworld activities, drug cartel operations and killings. “That was the reason people are calling for a Hitler-type leaders and the LTTE. The government which did nothing while the country was sliding towards anarchy, should now take responsibility,” he said.
Herath also said that yesterday’s disruption of Parliament sittings could have been avoided lest the government took action against the Deputy Minister immediately.
JVP MPs Bimal Ratnayake and Sunil Hendunnetti were also present.
