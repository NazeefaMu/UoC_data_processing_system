Our aim is to prevent the Micro Finance Mafia - S.B.

Our aim is to relieve poor people from the Micro Finance Mafia by developing the "Samurdhi Banks System" which has been malfunctioning during the past 10 years. Minister of Social Empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan Heritage, S.B. Dissanayake said at the official meeting to award registered certificates to the Samurdhi divisional organizations on November 02 at Suhurupaya, Battaramulla.
He said the micro finance mafia has been devouring rural areas and poor people of this country for nearly a decade. "This is not just a mafia but a cancer which destroys the economic foundation and strength of the poor people in rural areas. The Samurdhi programme had not been developed to address such issues during the past few years. It is our duty to serve the majority poor people of this country via Samurdhi Banks," he said.
The minister further added that after 22 years of establishing the Samurdhi programme, we have now succeeded in registering divisional organizations giving them the authority to work freely within a legal background. "As the founding minister of Samurdhi, I’m very happy to notice that the Samurdhi programme has earned around Rs. 2,000 billion as its capital which is not the money from the government Treasury or foreign money, but the money collected from the poor people across the country. Since we have such a large reserve, we have the strength to serve people better, through the Samurdhi Bank network with proper planning. If the people need to buy a vehicle, they now don't need to go to leasing companies with hidden interests. If they need to get fast cash by pawning their gold, we can make arrangements by strengthening the facilities. If the people need to get a loan within a day, we should tailor the system according to the needs since we have enough money."
When there is a funeral, the normal procedure is to grant financial aid only after obtaining the death certificate.
But it must be changed, because the money should be provided at the time of need, he said, adding that if not it is of no use. "Even at confinement, money should be given to the mother when she is admitted to hospital or at least within five days after hospitalization.
This is not difficult. Only the system needs to be changed. We have already taken the necessary steps to strengthen the Samurdhi bank system. On November 15, we will award appointment letters to 1,904 Samurdhi Development Officers.
After the appointments, we will also give them a 'Leadership Training Programme’ in collaboration with the Army. It will help develop their physical, mental and social status," said Minister Dissanayake.
He said funds will be provided for poor people to build their homes by providing Rs. 200,000 every month. Further the Samurdhi housing fund has already funded many housing projects to assist the people to build houses.
Director General Samurdhi, Dr. Sunil Jayantha Nawarathne, Deputy Director P.R.D.H Anurawansa also participated.
