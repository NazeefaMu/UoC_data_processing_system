SLFP stands above all for party members: Ex-Mayor

The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) stands above all for the party members. Local Government level representatives would not allow to divide it, said former Kotte Mayor Janaka Ranawaka yesterday.
He made theses observations at a press conference organised by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Kotte Central Organisation in Rajagiriya yesterday. Ranawaka said more than 2,000 participants will go to Maligapitiya in Kurunegala on September 4 for the 65th anniversary of the party.
He said: “Although we have been instructed to bring two buses we would take at least 25 buses to the anniversary.”
He said there are 14 UPFA Local Government members in the Kotte Municipal Council and 11 of them stand with President Maithripala Sirisena.
“Some attempt to divide the SLFP although the election is to be held in 2021. The objective is to protect a family from being taken before the FCID,” Ranawaka said.
“During the previous regime we were not allowed to exhibit a poster of ours depicting projects implemented by us during the previous regime. Those posters were removed using the forces and Police,” he said.
He said there were leaders who attempted to get petty jobs done by War Heroes. He said previous rulers used the security forces to make Pradeep Ekneligoda and assault Upali Thennakoon disappear. He said the former President should not betray the SLFP to protect his brothers. SLFP former local government representative Rajika Kodithuwakku said that it is not the SLFPers who attempt to divide the SLFP.
