Health Ministry refuses to settle bill for special drugs of Parliament Medical Centre
The Health Ministry has refused to settle the outstanding bill for special pharmaceutical drugs issued by the Medical Centre of Parliament, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya informed Parliament yesterday.
UPFA MP Ranjith de Zoysa, bringing to the attention of the Speaker that the Medical Centre of Parliament has stopped issuing medicine, asked as to why Parliament does not settle the overdue amount of Rs. 45 million to the State Pharmaceutical Corporation (SPC).
“About 1,200 Parliamentary staff and public representatives can obtain medical treatment from the centre. When I went to the centre today, they refused to issue any medicine,” the MP said.
The Speaker said the bill of the Parliament Medical Centre is settled by the Health Ministry, adding that Parliament could not take responsibility for that.
“I spoke to Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senarathna over the matter. He cited an audit inquiry as the reason for not settling the bill. The Health Ministry has refused to pay for special medicinal drugs. You can obtain normal treatment, but the centre has suspended issuing special medicinal drugs,” he said.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said he would inquire about the matter from the Health Minister.
Meanwhile, Parliament had yesterday returned a stock of fruits as the stock was not up to the standards. Fruits such as bananas and pineapples are supplied to Parliament regularly.
