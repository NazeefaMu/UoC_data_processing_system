Lake House Aloka Pooja helped create Buddhist reawakening: Mihintale Rajamaha Viharadhipathi

The white washing of Anuradhapura Ruwanweli Chetiya and Maha Seya on the summit of historic Mihintale is in progress at present.
The expenditure of Rs. 7.5 million for white washing was borne by a philanthropist from Pelmadulla - W. Ariyadasa - according to Chief Incumbent Ven. Pallegama Hemarathana Nayaka Thera. The prelate said the annual white washing of Ruwanweli Chethiya for the next 10 years had been booked in advance by devotees.
Meanwhile, Lake House has also contributed for the white washing process of Mihintale Mahaseya, and other shrines and monuments within the Mihintale sacred city. The Air Force has volunteered man power for the white washing task.
Referring to the programme, Mihintale Raja Maha Vihara Chief Incumbent Ven. Walawahengunawewa Dhammarathana Nayaka Thera said Lake House has provided 1,000 litres of white paint for the programme.
“The Lake House contribution to the development of the Mihintale sacred city is exemplary. The cynosure has been the Lake House Mihintale Aloka Pooja continuing for the 55th time during the forthcoming Poson season. It is truly significant that the illumination programme commenced by late philanthropist and founder of Lake House D. R. Wijewardena amidst much hardship still survives. Even war and terrorism could not stop this deed which reawakens the spirituality of people,” the Nayaka Thera said.
The Thera added that the Mihintale Poson week-long pirith chanting will start on May 29 and by that time, the white washing and renovation of Mahaseya will be completed. The Thera said even during the drought, around 1 million devotees are expected in Mihintale for Poson.
