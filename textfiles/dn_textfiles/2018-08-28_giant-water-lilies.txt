Giant water lilies

In Tawain’s capital city Taipei, tourists and guests can head to the Shuangxi Park if they want an Insta-worthy pic of themselves floating on a giant water lily.
Taipei City’s Parks and Street Lights Office put on an annual event to promote this rare species and educate the public. Most impressive is the The Victoria Water Lily leaf which can take on a maximum of 65kg. Smaller adults and children can hop aboard and pose away.
To protect the plant surface from being damaged, visitors are required to sit on a plastic wrap and only have 60 seconds before they have to get off. Originally native to the tropical regions of South America, giant water lilies were introduced to Taiwan and are now cultivated in Tainan and Taoyuan.
Although they draw in crowds and are impressive to look at, they are difficult to grow. Pests and high temperatures make it hard to let them grow into full-sized plants.
Parks and City Lights Officer Lin Chao-Chin said, “Currently, the challenge in maintaining the giant Victoria water lilies here at Shuangxi Park is that there are many snails and that we have to fight off pests, for example cutworms. This means that cutworms and snails will eat the plants. If we don’t fight them, the leaves would be cut off while they are still small. There would be many tiny holes in the leaves, rendering them unable to grow.”
Visitors have described sitting on the huge leaves as the same as being on a boat that’s floating away. Now in its fourth year, the show is expected to become bigger and better.
