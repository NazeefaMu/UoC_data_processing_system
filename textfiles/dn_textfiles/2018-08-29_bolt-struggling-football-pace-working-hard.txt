Bolt struggling with football pace, but working hard

Gosford, Tuesday: Sprint superstar Usain Bolt admitted Tuesday he was struggling with the tempo of professional football but is working hard to raise his fitness levels ahead of his first trial match this week.
The eight-time Olympic champion has been given an opportunity by Australia's Central Coast Mariners to fulfil his dream of a soccer career and has stepped up his training regime since hooking up with the A-League club last week.
He was put through his paces with the rest of the squad at a more intensive session at the team's base in the town of Gosford, 75 kilometres (47 miles) north of Sydney, on Tuesday. After some warming up and a jog around the pitch, he took part in ball drills and while his passing was fine, he was slow to get the hang of the movement required.
The 32-year-old's lack of football fitness was also evident and he appeared to tire quickly, resting more than his teammates.
Bolt admitted to struggling with the constant stop-start of football, more used to a quick fire sprint on the athletics track before winding down. AFP
