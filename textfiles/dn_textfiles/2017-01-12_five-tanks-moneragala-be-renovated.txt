Five tanks in  Moneragala to be renovated

 Five water tanks in Madulla, Siyabalanduwa, Sewanagala and Thanamalwila Divisional Secretariat areas will be renovated under the World Food Programme.
According to Moneragala District Agrarian Service Commissioner P.A.Madushanka, during the rainy session, the water capacity of most tanks is low due to silting. Siyabalanduwa Therela tank, Madugama Tank, Sewanagala Monerathenna Tank, Thanamalwila Seenukkuwa Pilimahela tank and Kotagama Alawathtakumbura tank will be renovated under the project.
