PARIS ACCORD: FORGET TEMPERATURE,ADDRESS PRECIPITATION

What is climate change - the scientist’s view point
Climate change is explained by Prof. John Seinfeld of Caltech University as follows:
 
(1) Fossil fuel combustion yields CO2 increasing its concentration in the atmosphere and part of this is taken up by vegetation, soils and oceans.
(2) When CO2 concentration in atmosphere reaches 560ppm (i.e. increase of 280 ppm or twice what it was prior to the Industrial Revolution), the temperature increases by 1.20C due to this CO2 concentration.
(3) This1.20C temperature increase brings more water vapour into the atmosphere to maintain constant relative humidity and this water vapour increases temperature by another 1.60C, and the total temperature increase is 2.80C.
(4) Today the CO2 concentration in atmosphere is 407+ ppm.
This increase in atmospheric temperature leads to (i) inconveniences on land - reduced agricultural production, enhanced contagious diseases, etc (ii) destruction of oceanic resources - rare species of fish, corals, etc, and (iii) reduction of ice caps and subsequent upping of oceanic water levels. This would also lead to areas experiencing temperate climate conditions been forced to experience unbearable conditions.

How water influences climate change
Water vapour directly influences all three climate parameters - temperature, precipitation and wind. What disturbs our life mostly is precipitation. Both excessive precipitation as well as lack of it leads to human misery. Our ability to protect ourselves from a climate calamity is also the least in respect of water vapour. It disturbs our normal life whether it is up in the air or is coming down or is on the ground.
According to ‘Global Trends in Water Related Disasters – An Insight for Policy Makers’, a report published by Yoganath Adikari and Junichi Yoshitani, of the International Centre for Water Hazard and Risk Management (ICHARM), 71% of natural disaster fatalities between 1980 and 2006 had taken place in Asia of which more than 81% had been flood related. Does not this clearly indicate that for us in Asia, at least, water-related disasters need to be controlled before temperature related ones?
Water, in different forms, goes through the global water cycle and is supposed to be of constant quantity.There is no natural process wherein water is generated or broken down to oxygen and hydrogen on a scale comparable to that associated with CO2. So whenever water vapour is formed using oxygen in the atmosphere, that oxygen is not replaced. So we have come to four conclusions from these facts:
(i)Water is the compound which affects and participates in all three climate parameters, temperature, precipitation and wind.
(ii)Water affects us whether it is up in the air or coming down or on the ground.
(iii)Formation of water (this definitely happens when we burn gas or oil as mentioned in the next few sections) using fresh oxygen in the atmosphere is not reversible in the scale of even thousands of years.
(iv) While lifetime of CO 2 in the atmosphere is about a thousand years, that of Newly Formed Water ( NFW ) in the global system may be a million years.
Sustainable Energy by Prof. Jefferson Tester (of Cornell University) and five other professors/researchers at MIT has four bits of information about this climate problem and its resolution: (1) Plate No. 4 (after Page 162) shows that USA in 2007 used 23.63 QnBtus from natural gas and 39.81QnBtus from petroleum. (2) Plate No. 16 (after page 162) has the Integrated Global System Model version 2 (IGSM2) developed by MIT. (3) Table 8.1 says Natural Gas has 3.5 – 4.0 atoms of H2 and Gasolene has 2-2.2 atoms of H2 for every atom of carbon. (4) Figure 4.1 shows how energy systems consume human and natural resources and produce useful goods and services and interact with the environment.
Table 8.1 implies that when oil or gas is combusted, hydrogen in the fuel, with O2 in air give out Newly Formed Water (NFW) – that is water which was not in the global water cycle earlier.
This NFW vapour with characteristics given below is the most dangerous output of anthropogenic energy generation processes:
(1) It is far more dangerous a greenhouse gas than CO2 when in the atmosphere.
(2) It leads to cyclones, hurricanes etc. when coming down. It fulfills five of the six atmospheric conditions required for a cyclone. The other is a location specific requirement.
(3) When on the ground, it leads to floods, earth slips, landslides, etc.
(4) No wall could keep these disasters away.
(5) Although it is generated in a distributed fashion– timewise and area wise – it accumulates in the atmosphere - timewise and area wise - and comes down in a concentrated fashion.
(6) Even without this NFW vapour, water vapour from global water cycle alone could create water-related disasters and this NFW vapour aggravates these.
Positive feedback effect of water vapour
When climate scientists dismiss the greenhouse effect of NFW vapour, they make two assumptions: (i) water vapour that comes into the atmosphere from below is of two kinds: (a) water vapour that comes even during normal times - i.e. even if fossil fuels are not combusted - which spend 7-14 days in the atmosphere and (b) water vapour coming into the atmosphere, when a fossil fuel is combusted, to maintain constant relative humidity at the elevated temperature due to higher CO2 concentration in the atmosphere which is retained in the atmosphere till this extra CO2 is in the atmosphere.
IGSM2 captures these streams within the Coupled Ocean, Atmosphere and Land System. Solar or volcanic forcing initiates the first identified as (a) while gaseous flow (of CO2,CH4, etc.) from the human system to the earth system initiates the second identified as (b).
(ii) The second is that NFW vapour from combustion of gas and oil also spends only 7-14 days in the atmosphere like the other water vapour stream, identified as (a) above, due to solar and volcanic forcing. IGSM2 indicates clearly that they have disregarded NFW vapour from fossil fuel combustion.
NFW vapour differs from the other two in respect of the following characteristics:
(a) Both those streams were already in the form of water in the global water cycle. NFW is new water formed by the combination of H2 in the fuel and O2 in the atmosphere. Hence it should go into the MIT Model IGSM2 as a part of the stream from the human system to the earth system.
(b) This NFW enters the atmosphere along with CO2, from C in the fuel, and it will not precipitate unless the temperature comes down due to seasonal changes.
(c) As long as this new CO2 stays in the atmosphere this NFW will also remain with CO2. Due to the differences in diffusivity and density of H2O from those of CO2, this NFW will move up ahead of CO2 and bring about its effects as a greenhouse gas and will not come down soon.
(d) This NFW vapour will be at a higher temperature than water vapour coming up to cool the atmosphere or to retain constant relative humidity.
(e) Heat content brought into the atmosphere by NFW is much larger than that brought in by CO2.
(f) Even if it comes down, it could lead to all disasters associated with precipitation and wind.
International Energy Agency’s document 'Revisiting Energy - Climate Change Map' published in mid-2013 talks about predictions for temperature increases arising from 560ppm CO2 in the atmosphere being 3.60C instead of 2.80C suggested earlier. This extra 0.80 C temperature increase could be due to this water vapour.
Why water-related disasters in USA?
According to the Hadley Circulation model, air flows originating from about 00N would go up and towards 300N, carrying water vapour, etc., and drop the water vapour at around 300N and come down and back. 300N is around New Orleans, California, etc. So it is no wonder that during some months of the year the area gets hurricanes and excessive rains. This new water vapour creates the conditions ideal for hurricanes with water vapour having a viscosity about half of those of N2 and O2
Longitudinal air circulation as per the Walker Circulation shows air streams from way down as 1500W going up as high as 15km and towards 900W and coming down. It explains how all the NFW vapour thrown out by natural gas and oil burnt in USA ultimately comes down on USA itself. The 2.54 Gt of NFW from oil and gas combustion in 2007 would explain 65% of the increase in precipitation - 0.15 in per decade - reported in USEPA website in 2014. Both these assumes that 2.54 Gt would fall on the entire 9.5 million km2 area.
Paris Accord
It is not prudent to talk only about temperature increase and CO2 concentration, ignoring NFW vapour, precipitation and wind in addressing climate change resolution for mankind. The Paris Accord says that we should keep warming well below 20C which implies that we are looking at only the temperature and ignoring precipitation and wind.
Abovementioned facts show that combustion of oil and gas yields NFW which could yield (i) greenhouse gas effect leading to enhanced temperature, droughts when in the atmosphere (ii) increased cyclones, hurricanes etc. related to wind when coming down and (iii) increased precipitation, flooding leading to loss of human life and agricultural production when on the ground.
Any international consensus to relieve world population living at different latitudes and longitudes from the travails of climate change need to identify how these different communities are influenced by different products of anthropogenic activities including energy generation which leads to NFW, CO2, etc.
A Nobel Laureate in Physics has recently said that the current increase in atmospheric temperature may be due to deforestation and tarred roadways. Out of all manmade structures, the highway is probably the place where they would (1) have carried out a lot of deforestation - loss of (a) CO2 absorption (b) trans-evaporation (c) reflection of solar radiation, etc. (2) put up a black, asphaltic surface absorbing near 90% solar radiation which gets re-emitted leading to global warming and then (3) start running vehicles generating CO2 and NFW vapour.
We developed highway solarisation - dedicated infrastructure to generate electricity to power electric vehicles or grid using solar energy collected by PV solar panels installed along and above highways as a solution for climate change to address exactly this. It will negate the first two concerns partially, but significantly and third, if the electricity generated is used to power electric vehicles to a degree which will depend on the level of vehicle electrification.
For every 1kWhr of electricity it provides to the main grid, it will eliminate 1.4 kWhr of radiation leading to global warming and if this electricity is used for vehicle electrification it will further eliminate 1.3kg of CO2, 0.5kg of NFW vapour and 4kWhr of waste heat, leading to climate change.
Conclusion
While we thank President Donald Trump for making us relook the Paris Accord and Climate Change, we wish he would be bold enough to take corrective action to relieve the American citizenry from travails associated with anthropogenic energy generation as practised today.
We are impressed by his own decision to put up photovoltaic solar panels on the wall he is to build along the Mexican border. Obviously, he would not miss the tremendous potential of its extension to highway solarisation of the 48,000 mile-interstate highway which when realized will convert it from the 18% marks, D-grade (as assessed by American Society of Civil Engineers in 2013) road infrastructure to be the best, most productive and most protected (from sunlight, precipitation including snow and also from salt to remove the snow) highway in the world. This interstate highway could provide 225 GW of power or 225TWhrs of energy to power 100 million electric vehicles of medium size to be available on the highway itself.
