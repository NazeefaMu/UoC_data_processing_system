Inter-religious committee to ensure peace in Ampara

Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen welcomed the suggestion by Ven. Suhadhagama Seelarathana Nayaka Thera to immediately form an inter-religious peace committee (IRPC) in Ampara, which is fast returning to normal.
“The suggestion is a great step to unite the people of Ampara,” said the Minister, when he visited Ampara on February 28.
Minister Bathiudeen met with Ven. Seelarathana Nayaka Thera at Ampara Mandala Maha Viharaya Temple premises. He was joined at this meeting by Ampara District DIG Nuwan Wedasinghe, STF Ampara Zonal Chief Athula Ratnayake, and Ampara District Secretary Thusitha P. Wanigasinghe, among others.
Ven Seelarathana Nayaka Thera said, “Representatives from all religions in Ampara should be part of the IRPC, which will closely monitor peace and reconciliation. I believe the government and police officials with us at this meeting should be part of the IRPC.”
“People were not attacked, but their properties were destroyed along with a mosque,” the Minister said, referring to the unrest on February 27. “The result is that fear gripped the Muslim populace here. Therefore the IRPC is important, and it needs to be formulated immediately with your leadership. We shall extend our fullest cooperation,” Minister Bathiudeen said.
A mosque, a lodging place adjoining the mosque, several small shops close to the mosque, a street-side hotel, and several vehicles were set on fire by a group of men in the early hours of February 27, after an argument erupted between some men and the owner of a street-side hotel in Ampara town.
On February 27, the Minister severely condemned the attack that took place in Ampara town targeting a mosque and several businesses. During the Cabinet meeting on that day, he called on the government to take “immediate and strict action” against the wrongdoers, saying that the government should compensate people for the losses. During his visit to Ampara, Minister Bathiudeen also met affected people in the town and had discussions with them, assuring them that the new committee will come into effect soon to safeguard them.
