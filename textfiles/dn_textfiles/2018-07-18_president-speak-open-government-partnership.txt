Three-day tour of Georgia
President to speak on open government partnership

President Maithripala Sirisena, who completed a successful three-day official tour of Italy where he attended the 24th session of the Committee on Forestry, organised by the FAO and delivered the keynote speech, arrived at the Shota Rustaveli Tbilisi International Airport yesterday to begin a three-day official tour of Georgia.
On his arrival at the Tbilisi International Airport, President Sirisena was welcomed by Georgia’s Deputy Foreign Minister George Sharvashidze and his delegation.
During his stay in Georgia, President Sirisena will attend the Open Government Partnership Global Summit 2018.
He will deliver a speech highlighting the positive steps taken by Sri Lanka to achieve open government partnership goals, a press release by the President’s Media Unit said.
The Open Government Partnership was established at international level in 2011 and Sri Lanka joined it in 2015 on invitation in appreciation of the good governance programme by the government.
To date, 75 countries have obtained membership in the Open Government Partnership.
This year’s session, attended by state leaders of membership countries, would pay special attention on global efforts towards strengthening challenges faced in combating corruption, and strengthening civil opportunities and government service.
Other members of President Sirisena’s delegation include State Minister Lakshman Seneviratne and Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanne.
