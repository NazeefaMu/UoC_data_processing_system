Mahendran wants copy of warrant, summary of evidence

Former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran who is absconding though a warrant had been issued for his arrest over the Central Bank Bond issue has requested through Interpol for several documents including the copy of the warrant, the Attorney General’s Department informed court yesterday.
Senior Deputy Solicitor General Haripriya Jayasundara appearing for the prosecution made this revelation during the magisterial inquiry into the Central Bank Bond issue taken up for inquiry before Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne.
It has been revealed that Arjuna Mahendran had requested through Interpol in Singapore for copies of several documents including the copy of the warrant and summary of evidence against him.
Taking into consideration the facts, the Magistrate issued an order directing the prosecution that court be informed regarding the measures taken to implement the warrant against Arjuna Mahendran, the first suspect in the case.
The Colombo Fort Magistrate had issued a warrant written in English for the arrest of former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran, in connection with the controversial Central Bank Bond issue.
The court had issued the warrant against Arjuna Mahendran, since he failed to comply with the court orders.
On a previous occasion, the Attorney General’s Department had informed Court that the CID is in the process of initiating necessary legal action for the extradition of former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran.
Meanwhile, Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius and its Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena, arrested in connection with the controversial Central Bank Bond issue, were yesterday ordered to be further remanded till August 30 by the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court.
On February 16, Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne refused to release the two suspects on bail citing that reasons given by the defence were not sufficient enough to consider releasing the suspects on bail under exceptional circumstances.
The suspects have been charged under the Public Property Act, Penal Code, Registered Stocks and Securities Ordinance and Code of Conduct for Primary Dealers for illegal insider trading.
Filing a B report before the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court regarding the Central Bank Bond issuance on February 27, 2015, the CID had named former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran, Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius, its Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena and the PTL as suspects in the case.
The prosecution maintained that there had been a direct loss to the government following the issuance of bonds on February 27, 2015.
The prosecution said that Arjuna Mahendran can be charged with the criminal breach of trust, misappropriation of public funds and two others for aiding and abetting to commit this offence.
Senior Deputy Solicitor General Haripriya Jayasundara with Senior State Counsel Lakmini Girihagama appeared for the Attorney General. President’s Counsel Kalinga Indatissa with Defence Counsel Jeewantha Jayatilleke appeared for the suspects.
