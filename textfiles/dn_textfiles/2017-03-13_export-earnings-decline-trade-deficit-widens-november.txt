Export earnings decline, trade deficit widens in November

Sri Lanka’s external sector has recorded a modest performance in November 2016 with the trade deficit widening as a result of higher import expenditure amidst a decline in export earnings,the Central Bank said.
The significant increase in import expenditure in November 2016 was mainly due to the increase in expenditure on intermediate and investment goods. Earnings from tourism continued to record a healthy growth while workers’ remittances declined marginally during the month.
The government securities market witnessed a net outflow in the month of November, while net inflows to the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) and long term loan proceeds to the government supported the Balance of Payments (BOP) in November 2016.
Earnings from exports at US dollars 810 million in November 2016 declined by 3.4 per cent from US dollars 838 million in November 2015, reversing the year-on-year increasing trend observed during the past three months. Agricultural exports, led by minor agricultural products, spices and tea and industrial exports led by textiles and garments and gems, diamonds and jewellery, mainly contributed to this contraction.
Earnings from agricultural exports, which account for about 23 per cent of total exports, declined by 8.3 per cent, year-on-year, to US dollars 183 million in November 2016. Earnings from minor agricultural product exports declined substantially by 63.2 per cent, year-on-year, mainly due to the decline in edible nuts owing to lower seasonal supply while spices exports contracted by 25.4 per cent with significant decline in pepper and cinnamon exports.
Earnings from tea exports, declined by 6.6 per cent, year-on-year, to US dollars 101 million, reflecting lower export volume, despite the increase in average export prices by 20.4 per cent in November 2016, which has been increasing continuously since August 2016. However, total earnings from seafood exports increased by 18.2 per cent, year-on-year, in November 2016, continuing its impressive growth performance since the lifting of the ban on seafood exports from Sri Lanka to the European Union (EU).
Seafood exports to the EU market grew substantially by 171.2 per cent, year-on-year. Earnings from industrial exports, which account for about 77 per cent of total exports, declined by 2.0 per cent, year-on-year, to US dollars 624 million in November 2016. Export earnings from textile and garments, which account for around 47 per cent of total export earnings, declined by 6.6 per cent, year-on-year, to US dollars 383 million in November 2016, reflecting lower garment exports to both traditional and non-traditional markets.
