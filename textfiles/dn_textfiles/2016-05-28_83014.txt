Royal-St.Peter’s will be a close game

Royal College Colombo and St.Peters College Bambalapitiya will feature in their Singer Inter-school Division 1 League Rugby Tournament second round match for the B.C.Anghie trophy, at Royal Sports Complex in Reid Avenue today at 4.30 pm.
The Royalists have brought in former centre Lennox Calyaneratne to play in the pivotal position of fly half at the expense of this season’s vice captain Ashok Wijekumar who is shifted to play in his pet position as scrum half.
In the pack Royal skipper Nikila Gunadheera will play as number eight. Ayesh Maduranga and Mohamed Nabeel will bind in the front row with hooker Azmir Fajudeen.
The forte of both teams have been their power-packed forwards. The Royal ‘eight’ especially Ayesh Maduranga, Mohamed Nabeel, Azmir Fajudeen, Harith Lokugamage, Pasindu Amarasinghe, Ashen Fernando,Maleesha Madumewan and captain Gunadheera are expected to give a terrific display in the loose today and secure ‘good ball'.
If they deliver then the Royalists will have a good chance of pulling off this game.
However they face a huge challenge from the Peterite forwards spearheaded by burly Rahal Delpachithra who will be ably supported by Ravin Yapa, Shane Gurusinghe, Senura Premawardene, Harin Biyanwila, Narendra Perera , Anjelo Mendis and crack number eight Sajith Seram.
In the set scrums the experienced Peterite hooker Ravin Yapa should get the better of his vis-a-vis Fajudeen while the line outs should be shared between the Royal duo of Lokugamage and Madumewan and Peterites Delpachithra and Gurusinghe.
Royal’s new halves combination comprising Wijekumar and Calyaneratne have been playing together. All will depend on how they will click as a pair in this crucial match. Peterites will hope that their vice captain cum scrum half Avishka Heenpella will pair off well with his new fly half Steven Sivaraj.
In all probability, young Heenpella will set his speedy three quarters in motion at every given turn, as they have two hard running three quarters in Diyath Fernando and Ramesh Fernando. This is in addition to the experienced centre Theekshana Dasanayake who has stood out with his powerful runs down the flank as full back cum captain Sandesh Jayawickrama is there to join the line and form the overlap.
They will hope that their new halves combination of Heenpella and Sivaraj will hit it off today. The half combination of these two players will have to give a very good performance if the Peterites are to emerge victorious.
