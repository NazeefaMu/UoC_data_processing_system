Presidential election manifesto included benefits for migrant workers for the first time: Thalatha

President Maithripala Sirisena takes credit for including pledges and proposals for the benefit and welfare of Sri Lankan migrant workers in a Presidential election campaign manifesto for the first time in Sri Lanka. Two such pledges were already fulfilled by him after assuming office, and this is a happy augury for the migrant worker population in the country, Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Atukorale said.
She was addressing the "Shramika Surakuma' mobile service programme participants in the Thambalagamuwa Divisional Secretariat division on February 3.
Among the pledges were ensuring the security for migrant worker families, a pension scheme, and 2.5 percent interest for non-resident bank accounts, Minister Atukorale said .
She said the 'Shramika Surekuma' programme was launched on January 8, 2016 to mark the first anniversary of the President's assumption of office. Development officers assigned to Divisional Secretariat offices were entrusted with the security and welfare of migrant worker families. Arrangements were underway to introduce the pension scheme for migrant workers in this year. She said the good governance government had taken all measures necessary to cater for the welfare of migrant workers who remit the largest slice of foreign exchange to the country.
Trincomalee district parliamentarian Abdul Mohamed and Eastern Provincial Council member Aruna Sirisena participated.
