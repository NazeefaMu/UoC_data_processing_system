Changing heads not the solution - GL

Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Chairman Prof. G.L.Peiris yesterday said that changing heads was not the solution to the current political issue in the country.
He said that changing the Prime Minister or any other person for that matter will not solve the current issue.
He said the people had rejected the Government's policies at the last election and the rulers should respect the public’s wish and call for an immediate general election. Addressing Journalists in Colombo, Peiris said the SLPP had won a clear majority at the concluded Local Government election.
He further said in order to respect the people’s mandate, the Government should dissolve Parliament and call for a General election to allow the public to choose a new government.
