Hotels, eateries in Akkaraipattu under strict scrutiny

The Akkaraipattu Municipal Commissioner A. L. M. Azmi has informed that any hotel or eating house situated within the jurisdiction of the Municipal Council area found to be hazardous to sanitation and health, serious action will be taken against such hotels or eating houses.
The Municipal Commissioner further said that if hotels and eating houses are not hygienic, action will be taken to close down such hotels or eating houses. Some of the eating houses and tea boutiques within the Akkaraipattu Municipal area are unhygienic.
They let the used dirty water flow to the drain bordering the main road which gives a bad smell. The stagnated water in the drain can lead to the spread of dengue mosquitoes. The hotel owners have been repeatedly notified of the unhealthy condition of their eating houses and hotels in writing as well.
These hotel owners and eating houses have been warned by the Municipal Council with regards to sanitation and maintenance of hygienic condition in the hotels, said Municipal Commissioner Azmi.
He also said final notices will be served on defaulting hotel owners. Following this there will be a final inspection of hotels and eating houses and the assistance of police and court have been sought to implement this programme.
The defaulting hotel owners will be blacklisted and their hotels will be closed down permanantly.
