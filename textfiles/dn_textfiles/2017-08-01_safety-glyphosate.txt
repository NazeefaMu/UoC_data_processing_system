The safety of Glyphosate

I would like to reply to two articles from Amal Wimalasena and Prof. Nimal Gunatilleke in the Daily News. No agrochemical is totally safe. As a person who is cultivating rice in the Kegalle district I know the importance of weedicides in controlling weeds and its importance to obtain a good harvest. If we want to use totally safe agrochemicals the humans will starve to death. At the time of Independence our population was less than five million and we imported 60% of our rice. In 2015 we were able to produce sufficient rice to feed twenty million people and also have an excess. This is due to modern agriculture practices and the use of agrochemicals. We still import most of our food from countries that freely use Glyphosate. Therefore it is not practical to burden our farmers with a ban and still consume food produced in other countries using Glyphosate. It is important to evaluate scientifically what is Glyphosate.
Glyphosphate is a derivative of amino acid glycine. It is a broad spectrum systemic herbicide, that has been used since 1970s. Glyphosate is the most used herbicide in the world. In United States 180 million pounds are used annually for crop protection and another 5 to 8 million pounds for domestic purposes. Mode of action of glyphosphate is to inhibit the shikimate pathway used by plants and many bacteria to produce aromatic amino acids. The enzyme inhibited is 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3- phosphate synthase (EPSPS). Glyphosphate inhibits the enzyme by binding to the active site. As animals do not have the shikimate pathway, it has very low toxicity to animals.
Toxicology of Glyphosphate
All chemicals are toxic. So there is a range for toxicity and LD50 is used as the standard. LD50 means the quantity required to kill 50% of an experimental rat population. This is expressed as mg/Kg body weight. The toxicity range for LD50 is 1) very toxic - less than 25mg 2)Toxic – 25 to 200mg 3)harmful – 200 to2000mg. The LD50 of some common chemicals are sodium Chloride(Salt) 3000mg,Ethanol(alcohol) 7000mg, Glyphosate has a LD50 of 5000 mg.
A systemic review in 2013 by the German Institute of Risk Assessment examined epidemiological studies, animal studies, and in vitro studies and concluded no classification and labeling of carcinogenicity is warranted and did not recommend a carcinogenicity of either category 1A or 1B. International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified Glyphosate as probably carcinogenic in humans (category 2A). IARC does not conduct risk assessment and they classify carcinogenic potential. This means a few positive findings are sufficient to declare a hazard. Although negative studies are also present.
Glyphosate is used in 130 countries. In September 2013 El Salvador banned glyphosate use after 2015.In 2014 Netherlands banned the use of Glyphosate for domestic use. In 2015 in France it was advised to sell Glyphosphate from locked cabinets. Sri Lanka and Burmuda banned the use of Glyphosate in 2015. It is very obvious that developed countries do not consider that the commercial use of Glyphosate is harmful to humans.
Glyphosate as it has a charged phosphate group binds strongly to soil. Therefore water pollution is very low. Glyphosate is degraded to aminomethylprosphonic acid (AMPA) and carbon dioxide by soil microbes. Half life of Glyphosate varies from 2 to197 days. Glyphosate and its degraded product AMPA are considered to be much less toxic than herbicides that were used prior to Glyphosate.
Glyphosate and Genetically Modified Crops (GMP)
Some microorganisms have the enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate syntase, which is resistant to Glyphosphate inhibition. A enzyme that is resistant to glyphosate and that has sufficient activity to continue plant growth was discovered from Agrobacterium sp. The gene was cloned and transferred to soya bean in 1996. Glyphosate resistant soya bean has been commercialized and other genetically modified crops that are resistant to Glyphosate are maize (corn) and cotton. In 2010 in the United State 70% corn, 78% cotton and 95% soy bean planted are herbicide resistant GMP plants.
In Sri Lanka a major component of the cost of production of agriculture is weed control. It is vital in major crops like Tea, Paddy and Coconut. The price of production of a kilo of Tea has increased from Rs. 126 in 2000 to Rs 422 in 2013. Cost of production of rice in the Polonnaruwa district has increased from Rs.15 .70 per Kg in 2005 to Rs 32.49 in 2013. The production cost for 1000 coconuts in 2002 was Rs.4154.00 and in 2013 has increased to Rs 12684.00. The use of manual labour for weeding may lead to a possible collapse of the plantation industry. The use of alternate herbicides will not only be more expensive, it will also lead to more serious environmental damage.
Chronic kidney disease of uncertain etiology (CKDu)
Chronic kidney disease of uncertain etiology (CKDu) is prevalent in the North Central province. Studies by Jayathilaka and co-workers indicate that risk is higher in males above 39 years. The farmers engaged in chena cultivation were more susceptible than persons involved in paddy cultivation. They observed food items in the endemic areas contain Cadmium at a higher level than the reference level. They concluded cadmium exposure is a risk factor and genetic susceptibility observed indicate predisposing factors for the development CKDu .
Danubian endemic familial nephropathy (DEFN) was first identified in 1920s. DEFN was observed in small discrete communities along the Danub River. This is only observed in adults. The disease is observed in people who are resident in endemic areas for more than 15 years. Over the years more than 25000 cases have been reported. The first hypothesis was intoxication with heavy metals. The etiology of DEFN is still uncertain. However chronic exposure to dietary aristolochic acid has been identified as a major risk factor in 2011. Aristolochic acid is present in seeds of Aristolochia clematitis (European birthwort), an endemic plant in the effected region. The seeds are mixed with wheat used for producing bread. Aristolochic acid present in Chinese herbal medicine is associated with a related condition known as Chinese herbs nephropathy.
In hot low land Central America a mysteries kidney dieses (CKDu) has affected persons working in sugar cane plantations. It was first assumed to be caused by infectious diseases and heat stress. Later it was blamed on herbicide and insecticides. However it was discovered that in El Salvador CKDu does not affect people working in regions 500meters above sea level. Pesticide expose is the same in both populations. Therefore heat stress and chronic dehydration is assumed to play a major role in the development of CKDu.
The future
A solution for CKDu requires a join scientific study involving multidisciplinary research teams to determine factors leading to the development of this disease. Experience from other countries indicates that this may take a long time. It is sad to observe that political decisions are made regarding scientific matters without consulting intuitions that have been establish by acts of Parliament. Sri Lanka Association for the Advancement of Science or the Institute of Chemistry has not been consulted before making a decision, which requires scientific advice. We hope that the Glyphosate ban will be lifted and scientific discussions regarding the dangers will be held before making a decision. If we assume we are more advanced in the science of food toxicity and food quality regulations than the USA and Europe it demonstrates our ignorance to the world scientific community.
