Cellular tower levy would only decelerate  internet penetration growth in SL

The Budget proposals to implement a Cellular Tower Levy of Rs. 200,000 per month per tower, payable by the mobile operators would have a severe negative impact to the mobile telecommunication industry. The proposed levy will increase the monthly operational cost from Rs 115,000 to Rs 315,000. (increase of 174%)
For more than two decades Sri Lanka’s mobile industry had been a key contributor to the economy of Sri Lanka delivering 100% population penetration of mobile services at some of the lowest tariffs in the world. Over the past two decades the Telecom sector has been the major contributor in terms of ‘Realized Foreign Direct Investments’ to Sri Lanka.
In a joint press release they also point out that the implementation of the proposed levy on towers would result in great losses to 3 major international investors, resulting in their possible exit from the market. The operators note that three out of the five mobile operators are still loss making.
“This loss-making situation of smaller operators is further deepened by their attempt to extend mobile services to under populated rural areas.”
As stated by the Treasury, nearly 6,750 towers are used by the five mobile operators to support the needs of a population of 20 million. However, each tower can only support the equipment of 2 - 3 operators due to tower loading constraints.
All mobile operators already share towers before any approval is given for a new tower in a designated area. As such, very few new towers have been built over the last few years. It is also vital to note that each frequency per tower can only support a few thousand mobile subscribers’ usage. Therefore, simple mathematics determines how many towers will be required to support the entire population.
All operators already have a large number of loss making towers in the rural areas. These losses will be significantly augmented if the proposed levy were to be implemented, making them economically unviable to sustain. As a result, mobile operators will be compelled to decommission a large number of unprofitable towers and reluctantly deprive customers of service particularly in the rural underdeveloped areas.
“With regard to the environmental and health hazard concerns raised, the mobile industry complies with all local and international environmental and health standards such as World Health Organization (WHO),
 Central Environment Authority (CEA) and GSMA standards. In addition, telecom operators have installed advanced lightning protection systems in all their towers to protect expensive telecom equipment on site and the locality against lightening damage.”
“Internet penetration in Sri Lanka currently stands at only 38%. The fastest and most cost effective way to increase national internet penetration is wirelessly through mobile towers. The proposed Cellular Tower Levy would only decelerate the growth of internet penetration in Sri Lanka by curtailing further investment in 4G and future 5G technologies, thereby depriving a large number of the population’s access to internet services, which is an essential service,” the release further said.
