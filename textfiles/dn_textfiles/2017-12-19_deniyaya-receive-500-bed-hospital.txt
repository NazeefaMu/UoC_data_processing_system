Deniyaya to receive 500 bed hospital

Construction of a brand new 500 bed hospital in Deniyaya will begin next year, according to Law, Order and Southern Development Minister, Sagala Ratnayake.
The Minister last week, undertook an inspection tour of the proposed land for the building.
“The Deniyaya hospital is a very old one. Its capacity is not only low but the old buildings were crumbling and have been constructed on just one level. It is a very difficult task to take a patient from one ward to another. Especially in 2003, the hospital premises were subjected to landslides,” said the minister.
He explained that they had been on the lookout for a land to construct a new hospital for a long time. Eventually, they focused on three suitable areas.
"Now we have found the ideal location. Geological surveys and the NBRO Department have certified this land 100 percent for construction," he added.
The 2018 Budget too has included this hospital in their proposals.
“We will prepare the ground in early 2018. Thereafter construction will begin. As a result many people will receive benefits through this project. In the second phase, we will build a good training facility,” said Minister Ratnayake.
"Our Southern Development projects are taking effect now. Especially, the Hambantota Port project will now begin. At the same time we will start its industrial zone. The Weligama Charlie Mount Industrial complex too will commence and we are now in the process of acquiring land for that. These projects will create jobs and bring in foreign exchange into the country," explained the minister.
“We have also started many tourism related projects which will give us quick returns. The main aim of the ministry is to create jobs and through that bring about economic development,” he added.
