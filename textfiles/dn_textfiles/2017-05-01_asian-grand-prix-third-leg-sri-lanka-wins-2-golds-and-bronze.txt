Asian Grand Prix third leg: Sri Lanka wins 2  golds and a bronze

Sri Lankan athletes won two golds and a bronze medal in the Asian Grand Prix third and final leg concluded at the Chinese Taipei International Sports Complex yesterday.
All three medals came in the 800m event category as Indunil Herath (2:51.34 minutes( in the men’s and Gayanthika Abeyratne (2:03.87 minutes) in the women’s clinched the two golds while Nimali Liyanarachchi (2:06.30 minutes) took the bronze in the women’s race.
Overall in all three legs, Lankan athletes won three golds, two silvers and three bronze medals. Athletes Indunil Herath (two golds), Gayanthika Abeyratne (gold and a bronze), Himasha Eshan (two silvers) and Nimali Liyanarachchi (two bronze medals) are the Lankan medalists at the three-legged Asian Grand Prix 2017.
Lankan athlete Waruna Lakshan had to return home without participating in the javelin throw event of the final leg after the Chinese air line demanded Yuan 1300 (SLR 28,600) to board his Nemith javelin on the plane. While Lakshan was inquiring into the matter with the airport officials, why they requested for payment after allowing him to bring the javelin from Sri Lanka to China free, the flight took off, leaving him at the airport. As there was no other flight to Chinese Taipei, he had no option, but to fly to Chengdu, the nearest airport where he can get a flight to Sri Lanka.
Lakshan paid Yuan 1750 (SRL 38, 500) for the ticket from Hangzhou to Chengdu and an extra Yuan 1300 (SRL 28, 600) for the javelin. He also had to buy the air ticket to Sri Lanka at a cost of Rs. 55,000.
Sports Ministry consultant and an observing officer of the event, Sunil Jayaweera communicated with Athletic Association president Sugath Tillakartne and tried to solve the problem. He said that there is nothing wrong from the Sports Ministry’s side.
“The Sports Ministry has granted money for the tickets. It was Athletic Association who made arrangements with the air lines and they should have informed the air line and make prior clearance. Some are trying to blame it on the Sports Ministry which is wrong,” he explained.
The Sri Lankan contingent will return from Chinese Taipei tonight.
