Ceylon Chamber releases ‘Economic Review and Outlook 2017’

The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce launched its ‘Economic Review and Outlook 2017,’ a new report, which contains information on trends, risks and prospects of both Sri Lankan and the global economy. Titled, ‘Triumph Through Turbulence’.
The latest report provides a view on the key macroeconomic factors shaping the business environment in 2017, including GDP growth outlook, inflation, monetary and fiscal policy, external sector, FDI, tourism, remittances and sectoral insights.
Under the ‘Global Economy’ section, the report focuses on prospects and risks in advanced and emerging economies, particularly US and Europe, which are key export markets for Sri Lanka.
Commenting on the launch of the report, CCC’s Chief Economist Anushka Wijesinha said, “This report is a useful one-stop-shop of information on key economic issues. 2017 will be a challenging year, both domestically and externally, and being aware of key economic trends is imperative for any business”.
