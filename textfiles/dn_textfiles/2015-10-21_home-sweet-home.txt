Home sweet home

Talking to Murad Ismail makes one feel that a house is a living entity. Almost like an organism that one can love and have a connection with. Haunted houses have been the subject of many movies. However to visit a haunted house one will have to go to Hollywood and thankfully not Sri Lanka! At least we hope not! Arch World brings to you your constant companion - the house.
They say a house has to feel different in the morning, afternoon and evening. Like a human being with varying moods.
“This can be done by manipulating the use of natural light and ventilation within the land. As you move throughout the spaces, at varying times of the day, the movement of the sun and changing quality of light lends each space a different feel. The play of shadows also enhances and changes the mood of the space,” said Architect Murad Ismail.
What makes a house a home are the memories it carries. It is more than concrete. We understand the attachment that makes it a home. We feel about homes. Leaving your home to go and live somewhere else can be disconcerting. Because to us it was a living object and not something inanimate.
“The house has to communicate with you. It needs to have synergy, which we try and achieve with natural light and ventilation. As the levels of light change throughout the day, it creates different moods and ambiences in the house. Most importantly the house is designed as a home, a space you belong in, to fit your specific purpose, so you don't lack anything.”
Technology
We can only imagine what kind of houses our children or our descendants will live in. Technology is evolving at a rapid rate. Our ancestors never imagined the light bulb before Thomas Edison. They said only angels could fly before the Wright brothers. Who knows what is in store for us in the future?
“Technology has come a long way and there isn't much that can't be built. However grand your design, technology can help you achieve it. However, I believe the use of technology shouldn't be used for the sake of using it. Rather it should be used to enhance a design. The design should take precedence and not the other way. Design has evolved in two ways - 1. Using technology for the sake of it i.e. the design is done to enhance the technology used. 2. Using technology to enhance the design.”
Ecological Designs, are to ensure that our actions and decisions today do not inhibit the opportunities of future generations. Similarly that can be said of a house. “I think there is a misconception that if you use bio degradable materials then you have achieved an eco-friendly design. The materials typically used in these instances: sticks & stones, timber, thatched roofs - all have a natural lifespan. Eventually, they all need to be renewed and replenished. They cannot be sustained over a long period of time.
In my personal view, ecological design is one that uses a substance that uses X amount of energy which will provide you with the use of a material that will last a 100 years. These materials take minimum effort to be maintained and do not need to be regularly renewed and replenished. They are more sustainable. You need to also consider the energy consumption used to produce the materials. Natural light & ventilation is also important to maximize the natural resources.”
Heat waves
Sri Lanka is a tropical country with frequent heat waves. Fortunately it isn't as bad as other countries where heat waves can actually kill. Nevertheless a house can be designed in such a way where this problem can be solved.
“Traditionally we were taught to create an opening at one point of the room and another one directly across from it. But I don't believe this works, as it does not provide a way for hot air to escape. The way we try to do it is to have a separate access point and exit point. Then heat up one wall of the space. For example, the outer perimeter of the wall is exposed to sunlight. Because of the pressure, the hot air expands, rises up and exits. The vacuum created will bring in new air. The new air creates a draft which will cool the room.”
Ultimately we want to be at peace in our house after a hard day's work. We need to come home and just ‘chill’
Decoration
“Decoration too, shouldn't be done for the sake of it. It should be done to enhance a space, to provide the space with a sense of purpose. There should be a peaceful cohabitation between the design of the space and the décor. The best advice someone gave me is to start every project as if you have never designed before. My advice is the same and to be simple.”
The grand hotel Water's Edge is a favourite for a wedding or a graduation ceremony. It is a beautiful creation, spacious and expertly designed by Murad.
“I don't consider any project my “crowning glory.” All projects are equal to me. It was initially intended as a golf course but we could never finish it. This was originally an environmental project to retain water that overflowed from the Kelani River. The land was filled up with earth dug from Parliament Lake. We dredged 105 acres of water which was 2m below sea level, 48 acres were left below flood level as marsh, and 48 left above flood level to accommodate the golf course and housing.
We were given the opportunity to go back and complete some of it in 2013 for the CHOGM. Even at that point, it was still not a golf course. The intention for Water's Edge was to be a building to create an economic center in terms of hospitality and recreation. The use has completely changed now,” noted Murad finally.
