20th Amendment gazetted

The 20th Amendment to the Constitution handed over by the JVP to abolish the Executive Presidency was published in the Gazette on Monday as a Private Member’s Bill.
JVP MP Vijitha Herath, under whom the Bill was gazetted, said that he is ready to present the Bill for the first reading in Parliament next week. The Bill has been gazetted after the approval of the Attorney General.
Under the proposed 20th Amendment, the President will be appointed by Parliament, instead of being elected through a vote of the people. The President will continue to be the Head of State and the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, but he will no longer be the Head of Government and the Head of the Cabinet of Ministers. The proposed 20th Amendment will be implemented only after the current term of office of President Maithripala Sirisena.
As per the draft bill, the Head of Government and the Head of the Cabinet of Ministers will be the Prime Minister. The President’s powers are distributed among the Cabinet, Prime Minister, Constitutional Council and independent commissions.
However, the President will continue to have the powers of appointing the Governors of Provinces as provided under the 13th Amendment. The President’s power to appoint ambassadors and high commissioners and grant pardons will be subject to Cabinet approval as per the proposed amendment. It will also remove the President’s power to prorogue Parliament.
The 20th Amendment also requires the President to seek Cabinet approval when granting a Presidential pardon. The number of Presidential staff should also be approved by the Cabinet. The President, once elected by Parliament, cannot hold any position or membership of a political party during his or her tenure.
