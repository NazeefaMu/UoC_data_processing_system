Waters Edge Opens Doors to ‘Our Shop’

Waters Edge recently opened a welfare shop to benefit its staff. A part of an ongoing welfare program to uplift the lives of those that serve the hotel wholeheartedly, the welfare shop named “Our Shop” will provide daily essentials at concessionary rates to all employees.
The idea for the welfare shop first dawned on Susil Silva who is currently the President of the hotel’s Welfare Committee.
“Our Shop” stocks a wide variety of staple products needed for a household such as powdered milk, rice, sugar and children’s products besides fruits and vegetables.
All these are made available to employees of the hotel at discounted prices. Further benefitting them, the system in place deducts the entire month’s grocery bill from the respective employee’s monthly salary. This is designed in a way to also educate employees on smart money management.
Waters Edge has an extensive staff welfare programme that is headed by a skilled committee and they carry out many projects annually that benefit the employees.
Another project under this programme is opening of a staff gym for all staff commencing from this year.
