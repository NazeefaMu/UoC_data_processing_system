Why you  should  not apply  toothpaste  on your pimple

When it comes to fixing acne, one of the most-common beauty hacks all of us have heard of is applying toothpaste, which happens to work miraculously! The paste contains ingredients like baking soda, hydrogen peroxide, alcohol, etc which help in drying out the pimples. However, applying the toothpaste on acne is not a safe solution, here’s why.
Skin irritation
Applying the paste on acne is one of the most tried and tested home remedies. The ingredient triclosan kills the bacteria causing acne on the skin. This ingredient immediately acts on the pimple and gives you fast results and sounds very promising. But, this hack also comes with a lot of skin irritation. The paste is made for teeth, which means the concentration is higher and harsher, hence the itching and the burning sensation is caused.
Dryness
When it comes to those big hideous pimples, toothpaste can immediately decrease the size. You may banish the pimple size, but this will also make your skin extremely dry. If you have acne-prone skin, then you can even witness more zits with the skin irritation and dryness.
Scars
At worst situations, applying the paste on acne can also lead to scars. For those angry red zits, toothpaste will cause a lot of burning sensation, which will eventually dry out the pimple. But with such harsh reaction, sometimes you can also be left with an ugly acne scar.
Stay cautious
Using toothpaste for your acne should be your last resort always! However, if you still feel the need, pick a paste with no added colours or whiteners because these formulas can irritate your skin more and make the acne worse! TNN
