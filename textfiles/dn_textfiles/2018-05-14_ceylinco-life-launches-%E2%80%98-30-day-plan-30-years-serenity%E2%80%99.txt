Ceylinco Life launches ‘The 30 day plan for 30 years of serenity’

What if planning for 30 years of retirement can be done in just 30 days, Ceylinco Life ventures to answer this question with the launch of its latest retirement planning campaign themed ‘The 30 day plan for 30 years of serenity’ highlighting the possibility of planning for a fruitful retirement in just one month.
The campaign runs throughout May and will make everyone that purchases a retirement plan during this period eligible to enter a draw at which a Star Cruise package for one couple, a Singapore tour package for two couples, and local hotel stays for five couples can be won.
Commenting on the launch of this campaign, Ceylinco Life Managing Director/CEO R. Renganathan said: “Retirement can seem a long way away, resulting in many people putting off a decision on this phase of their lives. Our emphasis this year is that this can easily be done in 30 days, after which our customers can relax and enjoy life, secure in the knowledge that Ceylinco Life has their retirement covered.”
Some 4,000 members of the Ceylinco Life sales team will be deployed in door-to-door calling in cities and towns across Sri Lanka throughout Mayto take this message to the masses, Renganathan said.
Personalised advice to suit individual retirement aspirations will be offered to customers, alongside the convenience of initiating a plan immediately for their future years.
The promotion will be supported by communications campaigns in print, electronic and digital media, and a thoughtfully prepared brochure that demystifies retirement planning. A series of promotional activities in selected locations is also planned.
Ceylinco Life offers a range of Retirement Plans that offer a higher accumulation rate than the interest rates on most Fixed Deposit and savings accounts. Returns from retirement plans are exempt from tax.
Ceylinco Life Retirement Plans can even be purchased online by visiting the company’ website www.ceylincolife.com.The digital platform is designed to help interested parties to engage and learn more regarding the concept of retirement planning.
Sri Lanka’s life insurance market leader since 2004, Ceylinco life has close to a million lives covered by active policies. The company is acknowledged as the benchmark for innovation in the local insurance industry for its work in product research and development, customer service, professional development and corporate social responsibility.
