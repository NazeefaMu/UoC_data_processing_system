Kataragama wastewater management project
‘No facilities for implementation’

Not a single shop or business in the Kataragama town has been provided with facilities to discharge wastewater to the newly-constructed wastewater management project although contractors were ready to leave the country, the Kataragama Ekamuthu Traders’ Association said.
Kataragama Ekamuthu Traders’ Association President H.R.K. Sampath said that the project was completed at a cost of 11 million Euros (Rs.2.1 billion). The project had been completed after laying wastewater management pipes at all locations except Gotaimbara Mawatha, Abaya Mawatha, Saddathissa Mawatha and Kandula Mawatha.
The project, which was implemented under the Water Supply and Drainage Board, was provided with funds during the tenure of former Uva Province Chief Minister Shashindra Rajapaksa. The project was implemented during the past few years and completed recently.
Although the project was proposed to facilitate all hotels and houses of which 90 percent have separate rooms to lend for the pilgrims, it has not been accomplished.
The Kataragama Ekamuthu Traders’ Association President said there are around 280 hotels in the area, but only few have been facilitated. He added that those house owners earn their living by renting out rooms in their houses, and they still face of disposing the wastewater from their houses.
However, he added that the authorities had called for applications to provide facilities. The people applied after paying their dues, but the answer they received was ‘rejected’. They said that the answer was unfair as people had paid a large amount of money for it.
Queried by the media, the engineer in-charge of the project, Manjula Priyankara, said that he was transferred to Colombo following a promotion that he received. He added that another sum of Rs.20 million is needed to complete the project.
He also added that the money had to be taken by way of a Cabinet paper and that the project had to be completed.
