Sandaruwani - one of the best hockey players produced by Sangamitta BV

Sandaruwani Jayaratne, an 18 year old lass from Sangamitta Balika Vidyalaya, Matale is an enormously talented hockey player and one of the best to come out of the portals of that school.
A very persevering type and a good fighter against odds and does not accept defeat lying down. She fights all the way to come out victorious.
Just look at this. A little girl still in her teens was left out of the Central Province ladies hockey team for the National Sports Festival. She attended the trials and did well in the selection match playing a key role in the only goal scored by her team. But still could not gain the nod of the Central Province selectors. Others would have thrown in the towel but not her. She had confidence in herself and she can make it to the top and she did reach the top.
A month after her dropping from the Central Province team she gave her detractors a slap across their faces when she attended the Sri Lanka hockey selections trials and found a place in the national team at the 12th South Asian Games 2016 held in Guwahati, India. This was also the first time that a hockey championship for ladies was conducted in the history of South Asian Games.
The talent of this teenage girl has to be seen to be believed. A very aggressive centre forward who has been playing for her school's senior team from the age of 13. In addition to this she also played for the under 13, under 15 and under 17 teams simultaneously. Another record which is hard to equal or break in this hockey town which is oozing with talent.
Her friends call her affectionately 'chocolate' because of her fondness for chocolates which she always carries in her pocket. She has no hockey in the blood as her two sisters Sachintha and Achini never played the game. It was with courage and self-determination she took to this with curved stick.
She first played hockey at the age of 10 and she was so good at it she was blooded into the senior team. It was not only hockey she played for the school as she excelled at elle, athletics and a little cricket.
Having successfully played for her school in all age group levels she played for the Sri Lanka Schools in 2012 and won Sri Lanka School colours for hockey in 2012 and 2014. She also represented the Sri Lanka Schools at the Junior National sin 2011 and also for the Junior Asia Cup in 2012 and scored two goals in one of the matches which Sri Lanka won 3-0.
At the Central Province schools under 19 hockey championship in 2014 she was adjudged the Best Player of the tournament. She captained the Matale District schools in 2014 and 2015 and also represented the country at junior level on many tours.
In the year 2015 her School Sangamitta Balika Vidyalaya won the Nationals hockey championship for girls schools, almost in the first minute of play she was injured with a torn ligament and if it was anybody else would have limped off the field. But she played on and along with Nawanjana Ekanayake played a key role in her school winning the championship title. When 'No side' was blown she lay prostrate in the ground in pain. She had continued to play in pain and lifted the morale of the team to beat Visakha Vidyalaya 2-0.
She took treatment and the doctor's orders were that her legs should be in plaster for two weeks. When the school had the felicitation ceremony for the hockey players she had to be carried to this venue as she could not walk because of the injury. But she had played the final match in full but in pain.
That is Sandaruwani the dedicated and brilliant hockey player. Her parents could hardly afford the expenses incurred in playing hockey and they dig deep into their pockets so that the home town Matale produces another top hockey player.
