Strengthening diplomatic ties

India and Pakistan joined the Shanghai Cooperation Council (SCO) at its Summit held in Astana, capital of Kazakhstan on June 8 – 9. The Summit was attended by Heads of State or Heads of Government of the member countries which now total 8.
Formed in 1996 its founder members are China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. The SCO Charter includes the maintenance of mutual trust, friendship and cooperation and good neighbourliness as well as consolidation of multidisciplinary cooperation in the maintenance of peace, security and stability in the region as its objectives, among others. It is supposed to be a countervailing body to the NATO Alliance. It covers a geographical span of the Earth in which over 50 percent of the world’s people live. Now India, China and Russia – three powerful players in international politics are its members. Iran, a formidable power in West Asia has applied for its membership and it is most likely the application would be considered favourably at its next Summit.
Pakistan Prime Minister addressing the Summit said that the SCO is a “sheet anchor” for regional stability. It is also a link between the Asia-Pacific, East Asia, West Asia and the Atlantic, he said. According to commentators the admission of India and Pakistan has enhanced the political dimension of the SCO. However, it has also the possibility of Indo-Pakistan tensions paralyzing its smooth progress. It will need a huge diplomatic effort to maintain and develop the sound relations between its members. The possibility of mature Russian and Chinese diplomacy influencing a rapprochement between the two South Asian giants also cannot be ruled out in the long term.
On the sidelines of the Summit Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Chinese President Xi Jinping and Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
Among the documents approved at the Summit are a Convention on combatting Extremism and a Joint Statement on counter-measures against terrorism. Sri Lanka and Turkey are Dialogue Partners of the SCO, a position confirming the similarity of objectives of the former with that of the latter.
Indo-US relations get cozier
The visit of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the United States and his official talks with President Donald Trump has made Indo-US relations cozier. The visit, which was his fifth after assuming office ended on a high note. President Trump called his meeting with Modi a “tremendous” success. According to Premier Modi the visit has consolidated a “robust strategic partnership”. He claims that the United States is the primary partner for India’s transformation.
A discernible shift in the Indian position is the overt support it has expressed to the belligerent policy of President Trump towards North Korea. By endorsing economic sanctions against North Korea and having imposed sanctions herself India has become a strong ally of the United States on the Korean issue. No doubt it has in mind the sympathetic attitude of China towards North Korea. The reference to the need to respect the sovereignty of nations and international law contained in the Indo-US joint statement is obviously a remark against the One Belt One Road initiative and the China- Pakistan Economic Corridor which runs through Pakistan controlled Kashmir.
India is also pleased with the United States designating Hizbul Mujahideen leader Syed Salahuddin as a “Global Terrorist”. The Joint Statement also refers to the need to combat “cross-border” terrorism which refers to militant groups based in Pakistan.
The visit has also consolidated and strengthened Indo-US defense co-operation. While India has promised to buy US Defense products the United States has pledged to supply unmanned drones and Naval Aerial Defense systems to India. Joint Naval exercises comprising Indian, American and Japanese navies are expected to be held soon.
Pakistan has already criticized the outcome of Modi’s visit to the US as a security threat that it would even encourage India to engage in military adventures. It is also unhappy about reference to cross border terrorism and the supply of sophisticated military equipment to India by the United States.
While reliance on the United States would ensure a stable climate for its own economic development over-dependence on the US would have a negative effect on its ability to be a stabilizing power in the Asia-Pacific zone, particularly in East Asia.
