The Sri Lanka Army Signal Corps is in the process of developing a method of preventing cheating at examinations using mobile phones and other communication equipment,Army Commander Lt. Gen Mahesh Senanayake said.
He was speaking during a ceremony marking the 75th Anniversary of the Signal Corps.
“I have instructed the Signal Corps to come up with a strategy and they are working on it. The people have great expectations about the Army and it is our bound duty to provide them the best service. We have sought the expertise of other countries in developing out knowledge on cyber security and we export our knowledge too. We are not the same army that existed in the 1980’s we have to be prepared to face the future and take on new challenges,” he noted.
The Army Commander highlighted the important role played by the Signal Corps in the present day context, accounting information as the fifth dimension of the modern warfare.
