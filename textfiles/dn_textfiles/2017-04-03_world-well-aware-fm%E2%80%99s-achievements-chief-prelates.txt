World well aware of FM’s achievements: Chief Prelates

The economic development agenda of Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake is envied by certain factions of Sri Lanka but it has been recognised well at international level, the Chief Prelates of the Malwathu and the Asgiri Chapters said.
The two chief prelates said Minister Karunanayake is engaged in a specific mission in economic building in the country.
The two Mahanayaka Theras expressed these views when the Finance Minister paid courtesy calls on the Theras after paying homage to the Sacred Temple of the Tooth in Kandy on April 1.
The minister told the Chief Prelate of the Asgiri Chapter the Most Venerable Warakagoda Gnanarathana Thera that he visited the Thera last year to obtain counselling in preparing Budget 2017, and the advice provided by the Nayake Thera helped immensely to present a successful national budget. He said such counselling guided him to prepare a budget that strengthen the country’s economy. The Minister provided details on the proposed development projects for the Kandy city and explained in detail about the proposed underpass to minimise increasing traffic in the city and, the development project which is centred on the Bogambara Old Prison complex. He further said that the advice of the Mahanayaka Theras are always sought before commencing any development work and the blessings of the Mahanayaka Theras are of paramount importance in these massive development work.
Minister Karunanayake who presented “The Banker” award, which was conferred on him after being selected as the Best Finance Minister of Asia Pacific Region, to the Nayake Thera for admiration, said that it is more an award won by the country rather than his personal achievement.
Speaking to the delegation, the Malwathu Maha Viharaya Chief Prelate Thibbotuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Thera said although a certain faction of this country is not prepared to admit the value of the Finance Minister, the International community has recognised it. Clear evidence to this is the “The Banker” magazine’s selection of Minister Karunanayake as the best Finance Minister of the Asia Pacific, The Nayake Thera said. Export Promotions and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama, Central Provincial Governor Niluka Ekanayake, Finance Ministry Secretary Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunga and several others participated.
