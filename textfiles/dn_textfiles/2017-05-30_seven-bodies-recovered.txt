Seven bodies recovered

Bodies of seven people among those who went missing following the Kobowelawatta landslide in Bulathsinhala have been recovered so far. Among them were five members of the same family including mother, father, son and two daughters.
Their remains were kept in a relative’s house in Rohalewatta, Horana and the funeral was held at the Horana UC cemetery on May 27 afternoon amidst a large gathering of mourners.
The other three bodies are kept at the Horana hospital morgue for identification since no one had come forward to identify them so far.
Several politicians including Ministers Mano Ganeshan and Palani Digambaram and organizer Kithsiri Kahatapitiya who attended the funeral ceremony at the Horana UC grounds were booed by the restless crowd saying no single official had so far come forward to lend assistance to the affected people. They said bodies were found through their own effort.
Meanwhile, a two-year-old child and the child’s parents who were rescued by the people have been admitted to the Horana hospital for treatment.
A search is still continuing to look for the dead and any survivors.
