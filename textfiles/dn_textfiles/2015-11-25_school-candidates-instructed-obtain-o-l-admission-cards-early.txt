School candidates instructed to obtain O-L admission cards early

All school candidates sitting the GCE (O-L) Examination 2015, which will commence on December 8 should get their admission cards from their respective school principals early, Commissioner General of Examinations W. M. N. J. Pushpakumara said.
According to the Commissioner General school heads have been instructed specifically to issue the admission cards immediately to the candidates once the admission cards are received.
"If students have to face any obstacle due to the delay in issuing the admission cards by the respective principal, the blame and responsibility of the fault will fall on the principal and disciplinary action will be taken against him. By now, the Examinations Department has sent the admission cards to the school heads," he said.
The Examination will be held from December 8 to 17 at 4,670 centres. A total of 664,537 candidates - school and private - have qualified to sit for the examination this year.
About 41,000 school teachers and school principals and other educational officers would be deployed as examination personnel, Pushpakumara said.
