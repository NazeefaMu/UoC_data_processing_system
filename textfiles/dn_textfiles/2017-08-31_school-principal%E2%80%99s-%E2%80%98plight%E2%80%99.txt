A school principal’s ‘plight’

Yet another sprat has fallen into the bribery net and had been made to pay for the felony. A lady school principal of an educational institution in Colombo has been sentenced to 8 years rigorous imprisonment, after being found guilty for accepting Rs. 25,000 to admit a child to the school. In addition she has been ordered to pay Rs. 5,000, and in default, a further two years is to be added to her RI term.
Harsh, one might say. This is considering the astounding swindles that are taking place in every sector today, involving millions of rupees, with none the wiser, and of course in the political arena, as is now being unraveled in all its juicy details. One time Sports Minister in the Rajapaksa government C.B. Ratnayake billed the education sector as the most corrupt, followed by police and the Cricket Board. Needless to say, he did not last long in the post.
What is Rs. 25,000 compared to what goes on elsewhere involving politicians and those in the corridors of power, one would be inclined to ask. We say this because it is well known that massive bribes are often given to politicians as an inducement to change sides, usually by the party in power. These may be in the form of cash, ministerial office or in lieu of withdrawing court cases against them. There was the instance where 18 UNPers crossed over to the government in 2008 to align themselves with Mahinda Rajapaksa, who was hell bent on obtaining the two thirds majority to have the Presidency for keeps. Of course, all were made ministers, although the common refrain at the time was they did what they did to strengthen the hands of the President to win the war, dheth shakthimath karanda.
Similarly, one witnessed one big crossover drama when CBK tried to get her ‘Unit of Regions’ constitution passed in parliament, when MPs from both sides were making a bee line to the other side with monotonous regularity, the circus ending with a whole band of UNP MPs ending up in Singapore, in order to keep them out of temptations way, so it was said.
Nobody thought this episode important enough to warrant an investigation to ascertain who got what.
It is in this context that the lady principal’s “plight” has to be viewed - eight years RI for accepting Rs. 25,000. True, the court has to act based on the evidence placed before it, and, without doubt, the learned High Court Judge had ample evidence before him to declare the Principal guilty of the offence. It is also true, that this is only one instance of bribery in the schools sector, that, unfortunately spelt doom for the lady principal. But how many Heads, in the so called prestigious schools, are in the game, but have been careful enough to cover their tracks? How many school Principals were under probe in recent times for having suspected to have accepted bribes from parents for school admissions? What became of their cases? What was the action taken against the Principal of an elite school, who went to the extent of setting up an additional classroom to facilitate extra admissions, in violation of the laid down rules? True, he was transferred, but is that punishment enough? Why did the probe end there?
Not just during school admissions, there are other avenues of taking bribes. Parents, are, ad nausm, called upon to contribute to this fund or that fund of the school and invariably there are buildings coming up every year in the school for no apparent reason. Parents fork out fearing retaliation on their children. Recently, there was a public spat between two factions of an Old Boys’ Association of a leading school, one accusing the school Head of siphoning off millions from a school fund, and the other coming to his defence. No doubt, there is a web of intrigue involving school funds, both, in state and private schools, details of which come to the open only when the factions are unable to divide the spoils.
A concerted effort should be made by the authorities to clean up the Augean Stables in the schools system. The Ministry of Education should play a more active role in this regard, ensuring that school Heads conduct themselves in exemplary fashion and avoid scandals of the nature the public are now privy to.
It is hoped that the fate that has befallen the lady school principal will act as a deterrent to all school Heads to strive to be above reproach. They, after all, are entrusted with guiding the destinies of the future generations. A school principal getting involved bribery, let along being convicted for the offence, was a rarity in the past. But the transformation of society over the past few decades, undermining all values, ethics, moral principles and spawning greed, have compelled even school principals to sacrifice their better judgement on the altar of mammon.
