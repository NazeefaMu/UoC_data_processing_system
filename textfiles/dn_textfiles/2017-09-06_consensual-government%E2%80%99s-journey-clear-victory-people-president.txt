Consensual Government’s journey is clear victory for people: President

President Maithripala Sirisena says the journey of the consensual government during the past two and a half years is a clear victory for the people, whatever said to the contrary.
President was participating at the launch of the Vision 2025 ‘A Rich Country’ , the Economic Development Plan of the government, at the BMICH on Monday. The event was held under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The President said that forming a consensual government, a new political experience which has never seen before by anyone was given for the country, for the betterment of the country and its people.
"Even though whatever allegations were levelled against the consensual government, or how challenging that journey is, it is a must that we should fulfil for the benefit of the country and its people," he said.
"Although we cannot achieve 100 percent successful results from the consensual government in a short span of time, which was built uniting two main rival political parties over 60 years, all were able to fulfil that challenging responsibility while fulfilling their duties in a more disciplinary manner during the past two and half years," the President said.
The President said the responsibilities towards the country and the people would be fulfilled with commitment, while taking forward the concept of consensual politics with a comprehensive understanding.
