Air Force to be revamped - President

Necessary steps will be taken by the Government to revamp the Sri Lanka Air Force and strengthen it with the latest technology in line with other forces of the developed world. This will include the infusion of knowledge and technological skills. The necessary guidance and advise would be sought from developed countries for this purpose, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
The President was addressing the gathering at the President Colours Awards Ceremony held at the Diyatalawa Air Force Combat Training School last morning.
President Sirisena said he was pleased to attend the colour awards ceremony held at this school to honour and convey the nation’s gratitude to the Air Force combat school which had rendered a sterling service to the nation for a very long period.
The President said the Tri Forces of this country had performed a yeoman service to the Motherland during the past few decades. Foremost among them was the dedication made to defeat LTTE terrorism which had been a bane to the country for nearly 28 years.
“The Sri Lanka Air Force had performed its duty and responsibility in the protection of the country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and joined their counterpart Armed Forces to save the country during national disaster situations,” President Sirisena said.
Air Force Commander Air Marshal Kapila Jayampathy said the Presidential Colours Awards Ceremony marked an important cross road in the 67-year-old history of the Sri Lanka Air Force.
“President Sirisena’s decision to hold a Presidential Colours Awards Ceremony to convey the highest honour to the service rendered by the Air Force was most praiseworthy. The Sri Lanka Air Force had been a partner in the country’s development process too. Several welfare measures had already been initiated by the Air Force such as the donation of houses to War Heroes, scholarship awards to children of Air Force personnel and remedying of salary anomalies,” the Air Force Commander said.
Defence State Minister Ruwan Wijewardene, Chief of Defence Staff Admiral Ravindra Wijayagoonaratne, Army Commander Lt. Gen. Mahesh Senanayake, Navy Commander Vice Admiral Sirimewan Ranasinghe Commander, Diyatalawa, Air Force Combat Training school Air Commodore Peterson Fernando and Air Force Media Spokesman Gihan Seneviratne were also present on the occasion.
