Diverse issues of the development drive

It is an accepted fact that at independence Sri Lanka or Ceylon as it was called then had a stable economy, although there was much to be desired by way of structural reforms. Other countries looked forward to Sri Lanka as a model and aspired to reach its level of development. Today, seven decades later we see that halfway through they overtook us and we are aspiring to emulate them and reach their present level in the 2020s or by 2030.
Obviously, something had gone wrong somewhere. Nay, many things have gone wrong, apparently. This is an attempt to recollect some random thoughts concerning certain aspects of development that the writer had witnessed as a citizen during the last 60 or 70 years. Not being an economist or having any claims to the specialised knowledge they would be far more mundane observations.
What strikes at first is that we have failed to manage our economy –to benefit from its early advantages- abundant material and human resources and rectify its shortcomings such as monoculture and low technology. While political changes were made slowly and reluctantly at first - Ceylonization and institutionalization - more radical steps such as nationalization and diversification of external economic relations came later. On the economic front changes were slower or non-existent with the continuation of the colonial structure and form.
Scientific approach to development
The lack of a scientific approach to development as well as the absence of planning is two more fundamental weaknesses that still persist to date.
The jumbo-sized Cabinet of Ministers with portfolios being duplicated or triplicated on the flimsiest excuse to suit personalities or political parties is a fine example betraying the unscientific understanding of development concerns of the country. For example, there are regional development ministries in addition to one at the national level. Ministers are saddled with portfolios that are as different as cheese from chalk.
Development at best is considered in bits and pieces. For example, it has been the practice to flood isolated regions such as Polonnaruwa or Hambantota and develop them fast and in certain respects prematurely whereas more backward areas remain unassisted. White elephant structures to enhance the egos of politicians are also a case in point.
Priorities have never been focused on scientifically.
Recently there was a news item that said that 57,000 computers in Mahindodaya Laboratories provided to schools have broken down and are lying unrepaired. Obviously, there was no plan to provide maintenance facilities, which the poor schools cannot afford on their own. This is another aspect of isolated development activities. While the building and initial equipping of them was considered a high political priority the maintenance of the institutions was not even an interest of the school or education authorities. Pragmatic and cost-effective ways are still possible using the already existing human and material resources at the command of the education authorities if they so desire.
This brings us to the need for a holistic approach to development. The economy is a complex of relations extending to diverse fields which are related to one another. Hence to separate them is artificial. They have to be considered in unison. For example, transport and education are two fields that exert an influence on agriculture. Similarly, it is connected to communications. The high price of vegetables and rice, for example, is partly due to high transport costs which demand structural changes in the transport sector. Nor is it independent of the level of technological development and human resource development.
National needs and priorities
This underlines the need for national planning. The institutions of national planning have been abandoned and the market is considered in blind faith as the ultimate arbitrator of everything. However, nowhere do the latter totally control an economy without state regulation in some sphere or other according to national needs and priorities. To put it differently, faith in market fundamentalism, a moribund trend under present-day capitalism is still fancied by our local Thatcherites and Reaganites.
It must also be mentioned that there has been a tendency to follow the example of Singapore or some other country. The problem is Sri Lanka has a different socio-economic background, resources and potential which demand a unique approach of its own.
It has been our misfortune to be deceived by Western definitions of developmental criteria. It was long believed that the GDP is a reliable index of development. It is not, especially in view of the human aspect that is overlooked by it. Statistical averages do not reflect realities on the ground. A high GDP could co-exist with an equally high inequality in the distribution of national wealth or income. Moreover, it has been observed that increase of GDP is accompanied by a higher concentration of income at upper brackets. For example, in Sri Lanka, the upper 10 per cent of the households earn as much as the lower 50 per cent does.
No development that does not guarantee equity in resource distribution and income could be considered perfect. The human element in development has to be counted. Development that cannot guarantee a minimum standard of living for the poor, a development the benefits of which do not reach the masses is worth the name development.
Futuristic vision
In this situation, various solutions are proposed. One is an appeal to retreat into a past golden age, often under pre-capitalist relations of servitude. It is impossible to go back. Mankind is on a progressive path of development albeit with its temporary periods of regression. That is how he has advanced from the Stone Age to nuclear age. From the club and axe to Super Computers and digital technology. Development needs not looking back but a futuristic vision.
Another popular slogan is that development begins at home and should start at home. This amounts to the society and the economy into infinitesimals with each unit being independent and guided only by the welfare of its own members. But the society of varied comprising various individuals and groups with diverse and even contradictory aims, objectives and interests. The mere addition of these individual development efforts would not produce a desired social development. Nor could it replace the class divisions and class struggle. It would only be a naïve dream.
Only a vision that could ensure a minimum human living condition for the poor and marginalized sections of the population could be rationally termed development. This would require the development of altruistic principles of social co-operation and social goodness instead of self- interest and personal aggrandizement or the elimination of tanha, in Buddhist terminology.
With such an economic philosophy there will be no place for discrimination on grounds of race, religion, social status, gender etc. There will be peace on earth and goodwill among all men and women.
