Steps taken to register all motorcyles

The Department of Commissioner of Motor Traffic is taking steps to register all motorcycles plying on roads using forged number plates without proper registration.
The department and the police had found that a large number of motorcycles are on roads with forged number plates.
Assembling of motorcycle using illegally imported spare parts had been a cause for this activity.
According to the latest surveys, unregistered motorcycles with forged register plates causes a majority of road accidents in the country.
The department had submitted a memorandum seeking Cabinet approval to register all unregistered motorcycles without any legal action against the present owners.
Accordingly, all unregistered motorcycle owners would be given a grace period to get their vehicles registered in their names by paying a fee.
A scheme to mark driving licences of errant drivers involved in traffic offences is also in the offing.
