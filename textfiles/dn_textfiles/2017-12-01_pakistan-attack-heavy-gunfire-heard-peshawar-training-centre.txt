Pakistan attack: 'Heavy gunfire' heard at Peshawar training centre

 
Several people are reported to be injured after gunmen stormed a college in the Pakistani city of Peshawar.
At least two gunmen, reportedly disguised in burkas, arrived in a rickshaw and entered the Peshawar Agriculture Training Institute early on Friday morning.
There is a heavy police presence in the area and the incident is still ongoing, media reports say.
The Pakistani Taliban have claimed responsibility for the attack.
The university is thought to have been closed for Eid celebrations.
There were also reports of a blast heard from inside the campus.
Peshawar, close to the Afghan border, has seen some of the worst violence during the Taliban insurgency in recent years.
In 2014 Taliban militants attacked an army-run school in Peshawar, leaving 141 people dead in one of the worst assaults in the country's recent history.
