No room for nepotism and authoritarianism in country - President

One family with no political aim for the nation, vision for the future of the country, or policy is trying to establish a party and form a government once again, but the people will not let this happen this time around, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
The President was addressing an election meeting held at the Davindra Mendis Sports Stadium in Katunayake.
"On January 8 2015, the government at the time was rejected because of corruption, fraud, and nepotism, said the President adding that there was no room for nepotism and authoritarianism to be established once again in the country.
He recalled that whilst the government had a Cabinet, from late 2013 onwards, every Wednesday, the Rajapaksa family would come together to decide government policy, economy, management and appointments for senior government posts.
The President also stressed that he would ensure that no persons from this government or the previous would be allowed to escape the law when it came to illegal issuance of bonds which had been taking place since 2008.
The country he said has finally united against corruption, nepotism and authoritarianism.
