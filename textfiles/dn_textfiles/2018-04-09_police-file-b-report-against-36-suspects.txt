Maskeliya clash
Police file B report against 36 suspects

Police had reportedly filed a B report in courts against 36 suspects who were found to be involved in last week's clashes between the Ceylon Workers Congress and Jathika Kamkaru Sangamaya at Maskeliya, following a dispute about electing office bearers to the Maskeliya Pradeshiya Sabha.
Police said that the said 36 individuals had been identified through CCTV camera footage of the clashes.
They were to be issued with a notice to appear in court in the near future.
Police had to be summoned to restore order to the inaugural meeting of the Maskeliya Pradeshiya Sabha held at the Ambal Hall which escalated into a clash on March 28. Jathika Kamkaru Sangamaya members later held a protest outside the Ambal Hall, which too descended into chaos as supporters of the two parties began to throw brickbats at each other, injuring many and damaging public and private property in the process.
