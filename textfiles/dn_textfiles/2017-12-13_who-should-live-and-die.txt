Who should live and die?

Life is a gift we have received. We are thankful to our parents that we are given a chance to live this life. It is not what we chose, our parents considered every child as a wanted child. And now with the development of medical technology, we can detect Anomalies when the baby is in the mother’s womb.
As a result of it if there is a foetal impairment, so-called Incompatible with Life, one of the options is to kill the child while in the uterus also called termination of pregnancy.
The sad part is that rather than using medical technology to heal the disease we doctors are killing the child to be born due to the limitations of medical science. Rather than taking the challenge to help the child live a quality life.
The dangers of this trend coming to our country are going to be a danger to the children to be born in the future. As there is a high chance that they may not get a chance to be born
This is a serious decision the doctor puts on the parents where they will decide to kill their own child as the doctor can not cure the disease. This adds to the mental trauma where they suffer from the guilt of killing their own foetus. This painful silent suffering goes on until the end of the parents' lives.
But if we doctors respect human life from the moment of conception until natural death. We have done our best to preserve and respect life. Even if the child dies after birth.
The parents and the Doctor can sleep peacefully saying honestly to their conscience that I have done my best to preserve life.
And the other reality which we must understand humbly is the fact that man is born to make mistakes wrong judgments, diagnosis and prognostic outcomes. As some foetal impairments cannot be diagnosed with 100% accuracy while the baby is growing inside the mother.
Thus a child who will have a chance to live might also be killed by the doctor.
I would like to discuss some of the conditions justifying killing (Termination of pregnancy) that are recommended by the medical professionals as Osteo genesis imperfecta (Brittle bone disease). Where the baby is more prone to have many fractures and this disease has many types, and some types are compatible with life.
Douglas John Herland was a person born with osteogenesis imperfecta. He won the bronze medal at the 1984 summer Olympics. He also promoted adaptive rowing for the disabled. Luckily for him, his parents never thought of him as incompatible with life and a burden to society. Douglas lived for nearly 40 years.
Potters’ Syndrome is a condition where the foetus has no developed kidneys. And as a result, there is less amniotic fluid and the foetus gets compressed inside the uterus. Thus the air passage is not formed well. According to doctors 100% the child will die, so they advise to kill the child while the baby is growing inside the mother.
But this is what Jaime Herrera Beutler, a US Republican Congresswoman, and her husband did when she was told that her baby has potters’ disease. And the doctors advised killing the growing baby inside her; she refused and went to a different doctor at John Hopkins in Baltimore who was willing to try a treatment that could potentially save the foetus. The doctor injected multiple doses of normal saline into the congress woman’s abdomen (uterus) creating enough fluid for the baby lungs to develop. Abigail was born. According to Dr Steven Alexander a paediatric kidney specialist, she was on dialysis. And her father donated the kidney and Abigail is alive still. So who are doctor’s to decide who should die?
Osteochondrodysplasia is a general term for disorders of the development of bone and cartilage. Achondroplasia, commonly called Dwarfism, is also included in this which is not a disease incompatible with life.
Thus where the proper boundaries, the indications for killing the foetus is not clear-cut, these should be killed and these should be preserved. Authorities should be more responsible in these grave and serious matters. As innocent healthy babies will also get killed.
Another mistake the Law Commission of Sri Lanka has made on this serious issue is that post-mortem examination of the killed baby is not included to be sure that the diagnosis of the doctor was accurate. If he has made a mistake of killing a healthy child proper legal action should be taken against the doctor.
Rashmi Gunawardena was born with only one leg. She writes with her only foot. She was the only student to pass the grade 5 scholarship exam with 153 marks for the last 10 years from Deloluwa junior school. If this law was there, chances of Rashmi being born a life would be grim.
It is very unfortunate that doctor does not understand that going against the natural law and against nature will be the downfall of humanity.
Finally, I would like to remind the doctors of the Hippocratic oath which we stood by specifically spells out not to do an Abortion and to safeguard human life from the very moment of conception.
And the other fact the people of this country should be aware is that abortion harms the woman’s body in many ways. It is safe to continue the pregnancy to term and deliver, quote Jeffcoat gynaecology
Always remember Abortion is always safe for the doctor because it is not his body he is doing the procedure on. But it is the woman who has to live with the short and long-term consequences of an Abortion.
Killing the foetus is, of course, the easy way out. But preserving life is difficult. But what we have to do is the correct thing. Not what is convenient for us!
