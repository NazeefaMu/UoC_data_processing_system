Citizens' Mail

Culprits exposed
The recent bail granted to two convicts of the same crime within hardly three weeks of the sentence, became an hilarious joke in society with some quipping it to be the latest Guinness Book entry.
It is a common phenomenon with convicts very specially those with influence to apply for bail on medical grounds whatever the crime although they are found to be healthy at the time of the sentence and expecting during incarceration pre-conviction VIP medical treatment they were used to with specialists at their beck and call not forgetting overseas medical treatment and check-ups at state expense in the midst of the current day agony the genuine patients are undergoing. Once released we see these convicts and accused travelling around the country as well as internationally and addressing public meetings with vim, vigour and vitality and other social functions.
In the eyes of the general public once could see the bluff that is exposed by these characters.
A good idea would be for Court authorities to call for a 6 months’ medical report of the accused to be presented to Court when the case is initially called with follow-up instructions to the JMO till the conclusion of the case.
