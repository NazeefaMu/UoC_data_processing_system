Basil wants almanac case taken out from Judge Gihan Kulatunga

Former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa has sought an order staying any further proceedings into the controversial almanac case heard before Colombo High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga.
Filing a Transfer Application in the Court of Appeal, Rajapaksa has sought an order transferring the case from the High Court presided over by Judge Gihan Kulatunga, currently presiding over Court No.6 of the Colombo High Court to any other court of the High Court of Colombo.
Judge Kulatunga is the Colombo High Court Judge who delivered the judgment regarding the controversial Sil Redi (fabrics used by devotees to observe sil) distribution case. Former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunge and former Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) Director General Anusha Palpita were sentenced to a three-year-rigorous imprisonment by Colombo High Court for misappropriating Rs. 600 million belonging to the TRC.
In his petition, Basil Rajapaksa stated that High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga was a member of Presidential Commission (PRECIFAC) which initiated an inquiry against him. He further stated that one of the primary grounds on which the proceedings before PRECIFAC are sought to be challenged by him before the Court of Appeal complaining that he was denied a fair hearing at the purported inquiry by the PRECIFAC.
On June 15, the High Court case against two accused including former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa for allegedly misappropriating Rs.29.4 million belonging to the Divi Neguma Department was fixed for trial on November 13 by the Judge Gihan Kulatunga.
When the Transfer Application was taken up before Court of Appeal (President) Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya and Justice Shiran Gunaratne, the Attorney General was noticed to appear in Court on October 26. The Attorney General had filed indictments against former Minister and former Divi Neguma Department Director General, Kithsiri Ranawaka in the Colombo High Court for allegedly printing five million almanacs with the image of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, costing Rs.29.4 million, to be used as election propaganda material during January 2015 presidential election.
President’s Counsel Gamini Marapana with counsel Navin Marapana, Kaushalya Molligoda instructed by Sanath Wijewardena appeared for Basil Rajapaksa.
