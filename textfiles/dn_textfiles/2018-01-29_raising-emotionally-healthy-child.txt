Raising an emotionally healthy child

Continued from last week
Without treatment, many mental disorders can continue into adulthood and lead to problems in all areas of the person’s adult life. People with untreated mental disorders are at high risk for many problems, including alcohol or drug abuse, and (depending on the type of disorder) violent or self-destructive behavior, even suicide
Schoolsand teachers have an important role in the recognition of mental health problems and in promoting mental wellbeing for all children
Teachers and Mental Health
Teachers have a lot of responsibilities: helping students’ progress academically, taking on community leadership roles, and maintaining a safe classroom environment, just to name a few. Yet perhaps nothing is as important in a teacher’s work as promoting the mental health of students. Students who are mentally healthy are more motivated, self-aware, and able to participate in a classroom community. Moreover, students struggling with mental issues benefit from teachers who are supportive and aware of the issues they’re facing. Let’s learn about how you can promote your students’ mental well-being.
Ten simple strategies to promote positive behavior
1. Verbally acknowledge children’s efforts.
Tell your child/student(s) specifically what he/she did that you are proud of. For example, you can say “You were so focused on your math homework tonight! Keep up the good work,” “That was so nice the way you helped your brother with his maths homework.” When children get praised for doing the right thing, they want to do more of it. Virtually all children want to please adults (whether they show it or not) so for most children, praise makes a positive impact. Praise is also an easy way to give your child attention which many children so desperately crave.
2. Use positive body language to show approval for positive behavior.
Positive body language can include a smile, thumbs up, high-five, pat on the back, etc. Keep in mind that some children do not like to be touched and would respond better to something like a thumbs up than a pat on the back. Get to know your child/students to know what they like.
3. Use humor with your child/student(s).
Make jokes, listen to their jokes, smile often, say something silly, sing something you would normally say, or anything else that would make them smile/laugh (make sure it is age appropriate).
4. Show your child/student(s) that you are happy to see them.
Smile at them when they come into the room; for parents…put your arms out for a hug. Ask about their day, weekend, etc. and really listen when they talk.
5. Remind your child/student(s) that they should be proud of themselves
(e.g., “You worked so hard on that science project. You should be so proud of yourself!”). This helps build internal confidence in them, so they can learn to be proud of themselves for being persistent, working hard, being kind to others, etc. If they feel successful they will be successful.
6 Take an interest in your child’s/students’ interests.
Ask them what they enjoy, get excited about their creations or accomplishments, ask them what they want to learn about, ask them their opinion about things, etc. Teachers…try to incorporate students’ interests in the classroom. Parents…do activities with your children (academic or otherwise) that involve something they are interested in, even if it may not be your favorite activity. Let them choose topics of interest for certain activities.
7.Acknowledge your child/student(s) feelings with empathy.
Be understanding when they are nervous because they are trying something for the first time, frustrated because a writing assignment is difficult for them, disappointed because they didn’t get invited to a birthday party, or embarrassed because other students laughed at them. Avoid saying things like “Stop making a big deal about it,” “You’ll get over it,” or “Why are you having such a hard time with this; it’s easy.” Instead, make empathetic statements like, “I understand that this assignment is frustrating for you” or “I understand that you are nervous, that’s common when trying something new.” Also, let them know that you are there to help in any way you can.
8. Be open minded and don’t pass judgment on your children/student(s) if their thoughts, values, feelings, or ideas don’t match yours.
Of course it is okay to share your opinion (and unsafe or hurtful behavior is unacceptable), but in general, don’t make them wrong for their opinion. They need to feel like they can be open and be themselves around the adults in their lives. When children feel like they won’t be judged or made wrong, they are more likely to talk to us when there is a real problem.
9. Be a role model for good behavior.
If you want your child to treat others with respect, you do the same. If you want your child to be an honest person, set an example of honesty for them.
10. Follow through on your promises and rules (barring unforeseen consequences) and stay away from empty threats.
If you tell your child/student(s) that they can pick a favorite book to read after they finish their math assignment, make sure you stick to your end of the bargain. If you tell your child that he can go on the computer after his sister has a turn, make sure he gets a chance to do that.
Have consistent rules that teach your children that they need to stick to their end of the bargain as well. For example, if you have a rule such as “Homework first, then TV.” stick to that rule by making sure your child completes homework before watching TV.
Definition
According to ayurvedic texts, a person is said to have good health or swasthya (in Sanskrit) when they enjoy a balance of physical and psychological elements (samadosha), of energies produced in the body (samagnischa), and of tissues in the organs (samadhatu) combined with proper elimination of wastes (malakriya), a happy soul (prasannatma), a happy, functioning mind (prasanna-manaha) and proper functioning of the five senses (sama-indriya).
To put it simply, allopathy treats specific symptoms with quick results, while ayurveda works on the premise that all disorders (whether physical or mental) result from an imbalance of one of more of the factors mentioned above. Effective treatment, practitioners believe, lies only in the holistic approach. It is this approach that leads psychiatrists to believe that ayurveda may hold the possibilities of a complementary, if not alternative treatment, for mental health issues.
Ayurveda, ayu (age) + veda (science) is the science of life. A science that encompasses the mind, body and soul with health. This ancient medicine has become the go-to treatment in several parts of Asian countries, because the absence of side effects. But while it is common knowledge that ayurveda is used to treat physical ailments, it is also being used as an alternative and complementary therapy in the treatment of mental health issues.
Ayurveda and mental health
“Ayurveda produces significant results as a complementary treatment method to allopathy in disorders such as depression, anxiety and OCD. There have been studies conducted where the dependency on allopathic medicine was reduced with a simultaneous increase in the ayurvedic dosage,” said Dr.LeenaIlleperuma MD (Ay), a consultant ayurvedic physician. She adds that there have also been cases where dependency on allopathic medication has been completely eliminated.
Ayurvedic drugs provide for a holistic change in the patient while allopathy deals with specific symptoms of the disorder. Ayurveda recommends traditional dietary and lifestyle habits along with yogic exercises and herbal treatment. It has proved to be an alternative form of treatment, which not only includes treating the disorder – physical and psychological – but also bringing in a change in the lifestyle of the person to prevent future illnesses.
Ayurveda stands by its definition of health, in which a healthy mind plays an important role. Being a holistic science, ayurveda explores the symbiotic relationship among the mind, body, soul, the senses and their workings. It approaches mental health in the following way:
• The human being is a constitution of the mind, body, soul and senses, also called Manas, Sarira, Atma and Indriya respectively. This includes psychological senses (Gyanendriya) and physical organs (Karmendriya). The dynamics of these primary constituents govern the health of a person.
• Manas is a constitution of three operational qualities: Satva, Rajas and Tamas. Also called gunas, these define the character or tatva of a person. Satvaguna is an amalgamation of all things good – self-control, knowledge, power to determine right and wrong in life. The qualities of Rajas guna are to be in motion, violent, envious, authoritative, desirous and confused. The characteristics of Tamas are being dull, inactive, lazy, sleepy or drowsy. Of these gunas, Rajasand Tamas are referred as Manodoshas. The imbalance of Satva, Rajas and Tamas are responsible for mental illness, known as Manovikara.
On the other hand, the body, which is believed to be formed from nature is comprised of three psycho-biological elements: Vata (air element), Pitta (fire element) and Kapha (earth element). These elements are also known as the tridoshas.
Dr.LeenaIlleperumawho has been practicing ayurvedic medicine for more than a decade, states that the tridoshas are essentially negative in nature, (in Sanskrit, dosha means fault) but they are actually protecting the body. She adds that when the three doshas go awry, they attack the body and cause illness to either one part in the body or the whole. This also affects the mind, causing mental disturbances and even illness. Therefore, the treatment in ayurveda focuses on treating both the mental illness and physical because they are inter-related.
Studies being conducted by ayurvedic practitioners on the effects of the treatment or specific medicine on disorders such as depression, anxiety have shown visible results
Ayurveda management
Ayurveda recommends three types of chikitsa viz., daivavyapasrayachikitsa (divine or spiritiual/therapy), yuktivyapasrayachikitsa (logical therapy), and satwavajayachikitsa (psycho therapy), for treating mental illnesses as well. Let us examine them in brief.
1. Daivavyapasrayachikitsa:
This refers to measure like mantra, (incantation), Ausadhi (wearing scared herbs), mani (wearing precious gems), mangala (propitiatory rites), bali (oblations), homa(sacrifice), upahara (offerings), niyama (vows), prauascitta (ceremonial penitence), upavasa (fasts), swastyayana (prostrations), pranipata (surrender), gamana (pilgrimage), etc,. These measures are recommended in mental disorders caused by agantu(extraneous) factors and administered judiciously after considering the nature, faith, religiosity, culture and educational level, of the patient. (Ch. Shi. 9/93-4). These may be useful in all types of manasavikara, i.e. both psychosis and neurosis.
2. Yuktivyapasrayachikitsa:
This refers to the use of ahara (diet) and oushadha (drugs). Under ahara, it is interesting to note that different food articles like ksira (milk), ghrita (ghee), draksa (grapes), panasa (jack fruit), Brahmi (Centellaasiatica- plant), mahishamamsa (buffalo meat), kurmamamsa (tortoise meat), vastuka (goose foot), kakamaci (solanumnigirum), mahakusmanda( ash gourd) kapittha (wood apple) matulunga * and others are recommended as benificial in various mental disorders(38). *(Citrus medica)
Under drug therapy, it is said that, in all types of mental diseases where vata, pitta and kapha are deranged, doshashodhana or srotasuddhi (elimination of dosha or shodhana or srotasuddhi (elimination of dosha or cleansing, the cells) has to be done by adopting various sodhana (purificatory measures). When the cleaning is properly done, samanausadha (palliatives) and rasayana (tonics) are given in order to bring back the deranged manas to normalcy.
3. Satvavajayachikitsa:
The aim of this therapy is to restrain mind from desire for unwholesome objects. This permits considering, occupational, behavioral and like therapies as well, since the ultimate aim of them also would be to restrain mind from unwholesome objects.
