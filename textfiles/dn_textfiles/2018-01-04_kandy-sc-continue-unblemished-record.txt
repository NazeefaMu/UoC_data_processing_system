Kandy SC continue unblemished record

Kandy Sports Club maintained their unblemished record in the current league season, by winning all seven games in a row with bone-crunching tackles, super-human power and breathtaking guile and pace.
They are sure to be crowned champions once again the way are getting about their business of winning matches. This is a team which has a bit of an unknown quality they seem fit and strong and have a core of good players. Kandy is the only club which plays rugby out of Colombo.
Kandy has been the most successful Sri Lankan club winning the league for a record 18 years between 1994 to 2017 and has been runners-up four times. They have the most number of wins by any club since the expanded competition commenced in 1950.
In their last outing, which was the first second round game they beat the Policemen comprehensively at Nittawela by 61 points to 20.
The policemen made some real individual errors and this may be the worst defeat for them. This game was played under ideal conditions. In the first quarter the policemen defended well and played good rugby and their ball handling was good they were able to score one try but they were deprived of further success due to the superb defence of Kandy.
Kandy was majestic and utterly dominant in all phases of the game which completely rattled the policemen. The pack showed more snarl than it has in the first round matches. Kandy passed well, tackled well and played as a team. They launched a vigorous game, and had the opportunity to push the cops into their own area. The Police could not keep up the pressure and were more on the defensive.
Kandy started and finished strongly with nine tries. They were good they were sublime, crisp passing, clever lines of running and footwork skillful enough to confound better teams than Police. The losers began clumsily, with a host of attacking errors. The cops could not make much progress with their play, since Kandy's flankers were up in a flash virtually anticipating their moves.
However the Police forwards were quick to rally round at the breakdown point and set up second phase attacks, but failed to do the need full with the ball.
It was the Kandy forwards most notably their third row who dictated the pace and pattern of the game. The flankers were outstanding; the open side flanker played a largely defensive role effectively supported by the number eight. The rest of the pack rallied splendidly around this dashing trio. They enjoyed a greater share of possession and it was a power-packed display. Cops whose strength lies in their agile forwards failed to utilize their potential to maximum advantage. Their fly half chose to kick ahead with regular frequency though Kandy’s fullback did not wilt under pressure positioning himself well to the high ball giving him plenty of time to find the safety of the touchline with relative ease.
Kandy was good in the rucks and mauls that they had the upper hand, but on the few occasions the cops did activate their dormant three quarters they brought life into the game. It was in the first half that they were stirred into action, but failed to continue the good work.
On Saturday Kandy will play Air Force at Ratmalana.
