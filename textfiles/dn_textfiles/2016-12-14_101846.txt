RTC Christmas Races conclude on a high

 
The sleepy little town of Nuwara Eliya began their Christmas celebrations on December 11 with a gala party at the Race Course - the home of Royal Turf Club.
For the sports buff there were a total of seven races with the feature being the Christmas Gold Cup for horses in the highest class. The bonus was the chance to watch a talented young lady named Rupa who was flown in from India to ride against the boys. She’s a Chennai based professional jockey who has been doing remarkably well in a profession that is dominated by men. For children the interaction with Santa Claus dishing out presents must surely have been the highlight, while for those seeking high fashion, the Deepthika Jayakody selection quenched the fashion thirst with models sashaying down the ramp.
Flying into grace the occasion was the Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara who regale the appreciative audience with two superbly sung songs.
The Yuletide decor simply took your breath away as the Race Course wore a beautiful festive look. But the Christmas spirit at RTC was not just a cosmetic. It went much deeper, touching the very essence and the core of what this festival is all about. It’s about giving, and here leading owners Mr. And Mrs. Edwards committed to the cause by donating the entire prize money earned by them on the day to the Cancer Society. Their horses ran their hearts out for this generous and gracious cause and won three races for the red and green sash silks of the Edwards family. RTC joined in by hosting a Christmas meal for their entire staff and their families.
The racing through the day was dominated by Trainer S.P.A. Raju who saddled a lucrative quadruple. He started it off with Captain Haddock (Admiral Of The Fleet ex Beladee) who made every post a winning one under jockey Mahesh to win the German Embassy Advent Cup. Gazaki (Burden of Proof ex Acer) then waltzed away with the Sports Ministry Cup. He was ridden by the Indian pro Aneel who went on from there to reel off a superb hat-rick thus cornering the riding honours for the day.
The Christmas Gold Cup was won by the Deepthika Jayakody owned mare Alcazaba (Burden of Proof ex Alambrah) who improved gradually from the rear to take over the running at the top of the straight and then win in style.
Corrine Almeida kept the crowds on their feet with her superb vocals.
There was something there for everyone and even the Weather Gods blew the rain and clouds away and the Sun peeked out to provide the perfect setting.
