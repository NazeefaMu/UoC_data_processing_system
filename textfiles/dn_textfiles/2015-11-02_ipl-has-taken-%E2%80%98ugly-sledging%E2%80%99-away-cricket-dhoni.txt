IPL has taken ‘ugly sledging’ away from cricket: Dhoni

Mahendra Singh Dhoni, India's limited-overs skipper, said Indian Premier League (IPL) has helped players from across the globe connect with each other and has taken away the "ugly sledging" from cricket. Stressing on the importance to keep the spirit of the gentleman's game alive, the Jharkhand-born cricketer was of the opinion that IPL and similar T20 leagues of the world have led to a good on-field environment in international matches.
"We play a gentleman's game. We want to win, but have to do it in the right way. IPL has taken the ugly sledging away from cricket. Friendly banter is good and that's what these Twenty20 Leagues has done. (IPL) really helped the cricketers in streamlining what was known as sledging," said Dhoni, who shared the stage with West Indies batsman Chris Gayle, said at a promotional event in New Delhi.
"I don't even interact with Indian players in IPL fearing what their team's policy might be, so I take care of all these things. But my equation with many players has improved just because of IPL," he added.
Gayle, who shares a good rapport with Dhoni, agreed with the Indian wicket-keeper batsman on IPL easing tension between players while the West Indian also mimicked the India limited-overs skipper's 'helicopter shot' on stage.
"I agree with MS about IPL. IPL has done wonders for the entire cricket fraternity. Yes, there is friendly sledging, like I enjoy with (Kieron) Pollard - Mumbai Indians player - but otherwise it's cool," said the hard-hitting opening batsman.
