We showed the majority, says Ranil

UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe, convening a press conference along with party representatives minus JVP who voted in favour of the no confidence motion, stated that they will take steps to ensure that the Government in place before October 26 will continue. Wickremesinghe also stated that 122 MPs who voted in favour of the no confidence motion have signed and handed over a memo to the Speaker.
 He also informed that Government servants and police “cannot carry out illegal orders from the purported government that has failed to demonstrate the confidence of the House or the people”.
Wickremesinghe made these observations before media and the majority of the MPs who signed in favour of the no confidence motion. He was accompanied by R.Sampanthan, Patali Champika Ranawaka, Sajith Premadasa, Rajitha Senaratne, Mano Ganesan, P. Digambaram, Ravi Karunanayake, Rishad Bathiudeen and the recent crossovers Piyasena Gamage, Vadivel Suresh and Manusha Nanayakkara. Wickremesinghe observed that Parliament in a historic move voted against Mahinda Rajapaksa’s Government and proved that it does not have the confidence in the House. He also said that the historic decision taken by the Supreme Court also confirmed the superiority of the Constitution while Parliament has now shown that it has a majority.
Wickremesinghe while observing that 122 MPs have informed the Speaker in writing that they voted in favour of the no confidence motion, said that, “If anyone wants to challenge the voice vote, they can move a resolution challenging the Speaker’s decision and we can put it to vote and I can assure you it would be defeated. If necessary we can pass another resolution saying the Speaker’s ruling is correct,” he said.
“To report that no decision of the House was made today is a breach of Parliament powers and privileges. The political arm has acted and no one in the purported administration can show a majority. When Parliament has taken a decision it should be recorded. This is another victory for people. One by one we are confirming that the Constitution is main law of the land.The Constitution should be applied and now we have proven that there is a purported government that does not enjoy the support of Parliament and therefore is illegal,” he added.
Wickremesinghe also observed that some MPs including certain SLFP representatives, who do not belong to the main three parties but voted in favour of the no confidence motion, have voted as independent MPs.
Some of the people who took office have also returned, he added. When a reporter questioned if he is the Prime Minister now, Wickremesinghe held up a board with number one printed on it.
