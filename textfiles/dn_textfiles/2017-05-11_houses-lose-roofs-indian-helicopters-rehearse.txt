Houses lose roofs as Indian helicopters rehearse

several houses in the vicinity of the Dunbar Grounds in Hatton were flown away as Indian helicopters providing security to visiting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi carried out a rehearsal yesterday.
Six families in the Samanalagama village have complained to the police that their roofs were partly damaged when the helicopters were landing.
The Indian Prime Minister is scheduled to visit Hatton to open the Dikoya Base Hospital funded by the Indian government.
