Politics vs aesthetics

In 1995, when James Wood first arrived in Washington to take up as the post as the de facto lead book critic at the New Republic, American literary criticism was in a mess. Genteel, mandarin presences, whose names have disappeared along with the memory of their pieces, still presided over the major magazines and reviews.
Who now scours the archive to see what Robert Adams or Robert Towers – or, for that matter, John Updike – had to say about any novel of the period? Several of the original New York Intellectuals – Irving Howe, Alfred Kazin, Elizabeth Hardwick, Susan Sontag – were still in operation but they no longer touched much new fiction, and their vigilance of the social reality around them had precipitately diminished.
The most promising critics of the younger generation had moved away from the political preoccupations of their predecessors into almost exclusively moral terrain. What was an acceptable way to fictionalize the experience of the Holocaust? How would the internet ruin reading? What happened when you wrote an incest novel without irony?
Establishing identities
Wood immediately registered as a different quantity: a rigorous aesthetician, a disciplined swooner, he appealed not only to argument but tested the reading experience against the actual, lived experience of the world. Beyond simply fulfilling the basic duty of the reviewer, which Edmund Wilson once described as “establishing identities for books”, Wood came closer than anyone to fulfilling Henry James’s maxim that criticism should serve as “the beautiful gate to enjoyment”.
If this were a James Wood review, now would come the Hussar-dash of simile: James Wood was like an early-career Jesuit gunning for a Bishopric, dispatched to restore order to dissonant congregations, swinging his thurible with steady intensity, reintroducing pungencies we had all but forgotten back into our deprived nostrils. Unlike that of so many of the critics around him, Wood’s felt much closer to the writing of writers.
His “writer’s criticism”, as he called it, bustled with elaborate metaphors and brazen generalities. His summaries of novels often competed with the plots themselves. In Wood’s view, part of the underlying health of any novel was its ability to survive this exercise, which he called “passionate redescription”. By the late 1990s it was almost beside the point that he signed his name to his pieces: we knew him by the style alone.
Formal task
What distinguished Wood from most of his contemporaries and immediate predecessors was his focus on matters of aesthetic liberty over social justice, and the suggestion that there was a choice to be made between them. He once described the “formal task” of fiction as the establishment of “a licensed freedom”. By this he meant that the novel is an art form that, through its very method, can avoid the theological and ideological impulse by cleaving to uncertainty, multiplicity, doubt. The novel, he wrote, “moves in the shadow of doubt, knows itself to be a true lie”, and it is here, for Wood, that the form’s fealty to the real can be found –<U+200A>a fealty that he sees as fiercely secular.
The most alive characters in the modern novel, he suggested, were the result of their authors cultivating a kind of productive imprecision about their being, an indication of bottomlessness, in which the unknowable triumphed over the knowable, and unreliability over transparency. But the novel was also more than that for Wood: he showed how free indirect discourse, when managed nimbly enough, could become an enactment of freedom, yielding characters who seemed to exercise a sovereignty that they shared to some tantalizing degree with their creators.
One of the reasons Wood has taken such an interest in an imperviously religious novelist such as Marilynne Robinson is that Robinson tries to reclaim some of these secular virtues of the novel as mislabelled religious gifts (a kind of Protestant religious freedom).
The brisk, dictatorial narration of Muriel Spark’s fiction likewise earns Wood’s approval because her characters are equipped to outwit her own batterings. In these gaps of self-knowledge, which readers can fill in for themselves, Wood sees opportunity for the kind of improved, novelistic consciousness that can heighten readers’ sensitivities to the real world, granting them “an almost priestly advantage over people’s souls”.
Pseudo-religion
Since the beginning, Wood has sought to guard literature against claims of its being a kind of canonical religion, or pseudo-religion.
Like a zealous new district attorney – all right then, enough – he was, shortly after his arrival in DC, bringing charges against some of the most egregious smugglers of religiosity back into literary criticism – Harold Bloom and George Steiner – whose worship at the altar of “greatness” turned out to be little more, in Wood’s view, than the work of vague mystics intent on obscuring our sense of the intimate craft and minute choices behind fictional creations, of celebrants devoted to the polished product rather than the artifice of the form.
If Steiner, one of Wood’s predecessors at the New Yorker, was one of the young Wood’s targets in bravura reputation-crushing, Wood was equally merciless towards another New Yorker elder for close to the opposite reason.
He accused Updike of worshipping a “complacent God” and writing fiction that, in its promiscuous, sensory overflow that swallowed his characters, threatened to make all of its dramatizations of the agony of faith appear like one shiny, smooth surface.
(This dissent on Updike separated Wood from Updike admirers such as Martin Amis, Ian McEwan and Christopher Hitchens, and showed that he belonged to something more than the English cult of the mid-century American sentence.) More than anything else, for Wood, Updike failed in the novelistic duty of helping readers to appreciate the arc of their own lives and, just a little bit, their own deaths. - Times Literary Supplement
