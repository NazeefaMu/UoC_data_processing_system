'Race 4' IS ON CRADS

Upcoming multi-starrer film ‘Race 3’ has already created a buzz amongst the fans before its release. Directed by Remo D’souza, the film’s dialogue and songs have gone viral and getting positive feedback.
In an interview, the lead actor of the film Salman Khan revealed that they have plans of making another sequel to the Race franchise post ‘Race 3’.
He said, “A single person in the film cannot do anything. Salman Khan alone cannot do anything in the film until the director, writer, star cast don’t support. Every person who was part of the film was so interested and dedicated that we had the most beautiful experience in this film, so now we are thinking of making ‘Race 4’.” TNN
