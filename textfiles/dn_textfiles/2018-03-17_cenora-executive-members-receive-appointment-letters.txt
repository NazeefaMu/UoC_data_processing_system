CENORA executive members receive appointment letters

Centre of Ocean Resources Analysis Sri Lanka (CENORA-SL) executive members received their appointments from Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development State Minister Dilip Wedaarachchi on March 14. Accordingly, retired Commander Fazal Mohammad was appointed CENORA Director-Chairman, while Ayesh Ranawaka was appointed Executive Director.
The concept of Blue Economy reached its pinnacle point of recognition during the past few years, when it was named as the 14th Sustainable Development Goal of the United Nations Development Programme. As a result, it saw its inclusion in Sri Lanka’s 2017-2018 national budget, which was dubbed the Blue-Green Economy Plan for the fiscal year.
The concept of Blue Economy naturally encompasses its agenda in it. Since 2016, the Fisheries and Aquatic Research Development Ministry had spent an immense amount of resources, both internal and external, for the said programme, which is the brainchild of State Minister Dilip Wedaarachchi.
As a result, the decision to establish a Blue Economy-oriented think tank, was approved by Cabinet earlier this year and thus, CENROA was established. The center would bring together stakeholders from various avenues of life, thus giving it the opportunity of tackling various ocean-based opportunities such as extraction of non-living resources, harvesting of living resources, goods and passenger transport and maritime security and marine environment protection, with its primary goal of creating innovation through the creation of job opportunities in the local market.
