Sri Lankan Ambassador lauds students exchange programme between two countries

The Sri Lankan Ambassador in Germany hosted a luncheon at his residence for a group of students from Sri Lanka recently. He thanked the German school, Gymnasium Isernhagen, for the support they extended to conduct an exchange programme between Sri Lankan students and German students since year 2007.
Even though the first exchange programme took place in 2007, the relationship between Sri Lanka and Gymnasium Isernhagen runs back to Summer 1995, in which the first group of students from Gymnasium Isernhagen visited Sri Lanka with Manfred Möller, ( the teacher in charge and the chief organizer of the programme). From then on, every second year, a group of students from Germany have travelled to Sri Lanka.
Since 1997, German students who visited Sri Lanka has raised funds for charity projects to assist the needy people and the institutions in the country, including hospitals, schools and orphanages. One such project conducted by Gymnasium Isernhagen was rebuilding four destroyed houses after Tsunami in February and March 2005 (2 houses in Maggona and 2 houses in Payagala South) and building a home for Tsunami-affected children and other poor children in Weliweriya.
Gymnasium Isernhagen took the initiative in 2015 and 2016 in financing Reverse Osmosis plants, one plant was opened in 2015 at Kakuluwela Maha Vidyalaya, Dehiaththakandiya, Polonnaruwa and another one was opened in 2016 at Kebithigollawa Hospital.
The first exchange programme between Sri Lankan students from St. Thomas´ College (STC), Mount Lavinia and Gymnasium Isernhagen took place in 2007, for which Ladies´ College Colombo joined in 2009. Ever since, these two student exchanges have continued to take place every year.
There have been 20 exchanges between Gymnasium Isernhagen and the two Sri Lankan schools, St. Thomas´ College and Ladies´ College for which about 160 students from Sri Lanka have taken part since 2007. Around 260 students of Gymnasium Isernhagen have visited Sri Lanka between 1995 and 2017 under this exchange programme.
As a result of an initiative taken up by Manfred Möller, the three schools involved signed a partnership agreement in July 2016 during the visit of Mayor of Isernhagen Arpad Bogyar to Sri Lanka, who visited both schools for signing the documents.
