Adequate stocks of essential items for festive season

All measures are in place to ensure that there will be no shortage of essential food items in the market during the festive season," Lanka Sathosa Chairman Dr. T.M.K.B. Tennakoon said.
He said that all essential items will be sold at controlled prices at islandwide Lanka Sathosa outlets during the festive season in a bid to bring down the cost of living.
He further said that ample stocks of essential items have been stored in warehouses.
"This move will avert any essential item shortage during the festive season. Sufficient stocks of dhal, white sugar, canned fish, wheat flour,sprats and chilies are available to cater to the increasing demand during the festive season," he said.
Tennakoon said that eight rice varieties, sprats, big onions, local potatoes, canned fish, milk powder,sugar,dhal and wheat flour would be sold at reduced prices, while assuring that good quality stocks of these items would be available without any shortage in Lanka Sathosa outlets across the country.
He said that Lanka Sathosa with the support of several private companies is engaged in giving special discounts to over 500 grocery items such as soap, tea, powder, jam, soft drinks and many other essential items.
"We hope to reduce prices of more essential items before the Christmas festival. When we drop the prices we believe the other super market chains will also follow suit,” he said.
He said that the Consumer Affairs Authority will take stern action against errant traders found selling the controlled items above the stipulated prices, or by using inaccurate weighing scales and failing to put pink price tags on the items,” he added.
