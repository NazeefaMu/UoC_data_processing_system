Constitution should be protected - Minister

The document that is highly cherished by any nation or community is the Constitution of one’s land. We are honour-bound to protect this sacred document since it determines the destiny of any nation, United National Party Chairman and Highways, Road Development and Petroleum Resources Minister Kabir Hashim said.
The Minister was speaking at the Highways and Road Development Ministry in Maganaguma Mahamadura, Battaramulla, after he assumed duties.
“We are proud that we were able to overwhelm the evil forces that were keen to suppress and negate our sacred Constitution. The victory we have achieved will be hailed by all the right thinking masses of this noble land,” the Minister said.
The staff of the Ministry and the Road Development Authority and well wishers welcomed the newly appointed minister. Parliamentarians including Dr. Tusitha Wijemanne, Wijayapala Hettiarachchi, Nalin Bandara and the chairman and members of the Mawanella Pradeshiya Sabha were present.
The Minister said the people must walk forward for the development of the country. “We should forget what had happened and work together to achieve development goals. Rs. 2,500 billion had been allocated for rural road development work. The rural road network should be improved for the benefit of the children as well as the rural community, the Minister said.
Over Rs. 280 million has been lost due to wrong decisions and the people who took those wrong decisions were responsible for it, Minister Hashim said.
