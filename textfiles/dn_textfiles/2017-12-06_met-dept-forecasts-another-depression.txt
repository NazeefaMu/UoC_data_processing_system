Met. Dept. forecasts another depression

The Meteorology Department yesterday said that a low pressure area in the South-East of Bengal, which is located 950 km away from Sri Lanka, is likely to develop into a depression today.
Therefore, wind speed can be increased in Eastern and Northern provinces and in Northern and Eastern sea areas as well. Showers or thundershowers will occur at times in Northern, North-Central, Eastern and Uva provinces.
Fairly heavy showers (about 75 mm) can be expected in Eastern, Northern, North-central and Uva provinces. Fairly strong gusty winds (up to 50 kmph) can be expected in the Northern, Eastern, Uva, Sabaragamuwa and Western provinces and in Galle and Matara districts.
Due to adverse marine weather, fishermen were requested not to go out to sea, from December 5 to 8.
Showers or thundershowers will occur at times in the sea areas off the coast extending from Potuvil to Kankasanturai via Trincomalee.
Winds will be north-easterly to Northerly in direction in the sea area around the island and wind speed will be 30-40 kmph. The sea areas 200 km off the north-eastern, eastern and south-eastern coasts can be very rough as the wind speed will increase up to 90-100 kmph.
The shallow sea area off the coast extending from Potuvil to Kankasanturai via Trincomalee and Colombo to Matara via Galle can be temporary rough at times as the wind speed can increase up to 60-70 kmph. Temporarily strong gusty winds (up to 70-80 kmph) and very rough seas can be expected in the sea areas during thundershowers.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Disaster Management yesterday requested technical agencies to simplify the warning messages to layman language and ensure that the message reaches all people concerned ,with the support of Media, Police, Local Government Mechanisms, Telephone Service Providers, and Fisheries Ministries and through all means of communications.
