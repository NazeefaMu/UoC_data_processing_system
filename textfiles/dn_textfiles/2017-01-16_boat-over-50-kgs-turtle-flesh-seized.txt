Officers attached to the Coast Conservation Department's Chilaw Unit seized a boat loaded with more than 50 kgs of turtle flesh which beached at the Taldeka shore in Nainamadama in the wee hours of yesterday during a search operation in the area.
A suspect manning the boat and two others waiting on the coastline had fled the scene leaving the boat sensing the raid. A special investigation is on to apprehend the suspects.
