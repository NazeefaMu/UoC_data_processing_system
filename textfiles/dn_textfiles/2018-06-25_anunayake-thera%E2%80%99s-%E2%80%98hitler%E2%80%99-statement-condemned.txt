Anunayake Thera’s ‘Hitler’ statement condemned

“We wish to condemn with deep abhorrence as members of the Maha Sangha, the statement allegedly made by Ven. Wendaruwe Upali Anunayake Thera of the Asgiriya Chapter calling for a Hitler type administration,” Mahawatte Sri Vivekaramadhipati Ven. Kehelulle Sumedha Chief Sanghanayake Thera of Galle Four Gravets and Hinidum Pattuwa VenSumedha Nayaka Thera said.
“Although Ven. Upali Thera is alleged to have made the Statement at an anusasana held during a Sanghakika dana to mark the 69th birthday of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, it was not the manner a bhikkhu should deliver an anusasana,” the Thera said. The Thera said the statement made by the Anunuayake Thera was most unbecoming and never expected from even a novice samanera.
“Even samaneras were expected to make statements subject to their tutors without causing disrepute to the Sasana,” the Thera said.
“A majority of people would condemn the alleged statement made by a leading prelate such as Ven. Upali Thera,” Ven. Sumedha Nayaka Thera said.
“People were fully aware of cruelties and oppression inflicted by Hitler during his iron rule. Bhikkhus ought to deliver anusasanas to laymen in a more disciplined manner upholding religious and national values,” the Anunayake said.
