Await final decision from West Indies Cricket
Sri Lanka confident  Caribbean tour will go ahead

Sri Lanka Cricket was confident that the tour to the West Indies later this month will not be cancelled but will go ahead with a toned down itinerary.
In a rather sudden decision Cricket West Indies had informed SLC on Friday that they were going through financial difficulties hosting the three-Test series tour by Sri Lanka to the Caribbean that is due to commence next month.
However a final decision on the outcome of the tour was to be taken at a meeting of Cricket West Indies scheduled for Sunday.
“We will know the outcome of the meeting only today because of the time differences, but we are confident the tour will go ahead,” said Sri Lanka Cricket CEO Ashley de Silva.
“We could still go ahead with the three Tests or with a lesser number of games.
We are awaiting a response from Cricket West Indies,” he said.
De Silva said the 17-member team led by Dinesh Chandimal was due to leave for West Indies as scheduled on May 25 and there has been no alternate change of plans.
Sri Lanka are due to open the tour with a 3-day practice match at Trinidad starting on May 30 before moving into a three Test series at Port of Spain on June 6. The second Test is scheduled to commence on June 14 at St Lucia’s and the third and final Test which will be a day-night affair at Bridgetown starting on June 23.
Sri Lanka last toured the West Indies in 2008 where they drew the two-Test series 1-all and recorded their first-ever Test win in the Caribbean. Sri Lanka’s current schedule included a three-Test series in the Caribbean for the first time, but with the current change of events that may not take place. - ST
