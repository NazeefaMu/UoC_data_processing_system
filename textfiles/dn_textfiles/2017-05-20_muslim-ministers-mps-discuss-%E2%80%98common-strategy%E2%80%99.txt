Muslim Ministers, MPs discuss ‘common strategy’

Muslim Ministers and MPs who met yesterday morning to discuss a ‘common strategy’ to ‘approach the President and Prime Minister’ on the recent attacks faced by the Muslim community, warn that they would choose to sit independently in Parliament if the Leaders do not take action to rein in extremist groups in the country.
According to a post shared on Muslim Affairs and Postal
Services Minister Abdul Haleem’s Facebook profile, the Muslim legislators met at his ministry. Their focus has been the recent increase in activity by the Buddhist group; Bodu Bala Sena (BBS).
Over the last week, a series of incidents such as the attack on the Kohilawatte mosque in Sedawatte by an unidentified gang have led the MPs to believe that the BBS might be involved though the attackers are yet to be identified and apprehended. A source at the meeting speaking to the Daily News said that they have sent a letter requesting for a meeting with the President and they hoped that they would get an appointment with the President.
“We are not asking for anything special.
All we want is that law and order in this country should be respected that the culprits be apprehended. If not, we will have to take action and be independent,’the source said.
“The Muslim community which had voted against the previous regime for their apathy towards rising extremist sentiment towards the community finds that the present government too should act more on this matter,” the source continued. “The present government does not support extremism, but, it feels like they are not doing anything to stop it either,” the source said.
