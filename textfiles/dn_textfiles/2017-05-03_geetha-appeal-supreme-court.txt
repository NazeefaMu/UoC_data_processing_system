Geetha to appeal to Supreme Court

 
Galle district United People’s Freedom Alliance MP Geetha Kumarasinghe, who was ruled disqualified from her position by the Court of Appeal this morning, said she would appeal against the verdict at the Supreme Court.
Speaking to Daily News Online the former MP said the decision by the Appeals Court was unfair as she was elected to Parliament by public vote.
“This even challenged the positions of the rest of the Parliamentary body,” she said.
The Court of Appeal today ruled that Geetha Kumarasinghe was disqualified from her position as Member of Parliament, because she holds dual citizenship in Sri Lanka and Switzerland.
A writ petition was filed by five residents of Galle district challenging the constitutionality of Kumarasinghe appointment as a Member of Parliament.
As per Article 91(1)(d)(xiii) of Section 20 of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, no citizen of Sri Lanka who is also a citizen of any other country is qualified to be elected as a Member of Parliament or to sit and vote in Parliament.
