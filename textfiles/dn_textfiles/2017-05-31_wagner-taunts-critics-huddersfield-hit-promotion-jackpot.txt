Wagner taunts critics as Huddersfield hit promotion jackpot

London: David Wagner’s arrival at Huddersfield Town was greeted with scorn, but just 18 months later the German has silenced the critics by masterminding his club’s fairytale promotion to the Premier League.
When Wagner was plucked from his role as Borussia Dortmund’s reserve team coach by Huddersfield owner Dean Hoyle in November 2015, many pundits claimed his lack of experience in the cut-throat world of the second-tier Championship meant the appointment was doomed to failure.
Ian Holloway, then a television pundit and now Queens Park Rangers manager, labelled Huddersfield as candidates for relegation at the start of this season.
But Holloway and the rest of the doubters underestimated the urbane Wagner’s pioneer spirit, inspirational personality and tactical prowess.
Having revitalised his team with a host of youngsters signed on loan from the Premier League, Wagner rewarded Hoyle’s faith in spectacular fashion at Wembley on Monday as Huddersfield beat Reading 4-3 on penalties after a 0-0 draw to return to the top flight for the first time in 45 years.
Winning promotion, which is worth £170 million ($218 million, 195 million euros) to the Terriers, was a sweet moment for Wagner and, drenched in champagne from his players’ celebrations, he arrived at a post-match press conference keen to remind his critics how far he had come in such a short time.
“By the way Ian Holloway, all the best for next season,” Wagner said.
“I know a lot of the pundits wrote us off. I’m so happy to prove experience is not essential, especially here in England which is so traditional.
“I’ve been in confrontation with experience ever since I’ve been here. People said I’m not used to English football, I’m not used to not having a winter break, and I’d never been in the play-offs before.
“Well, experience is important, but if you have passion and ideas you can match it.”
Wagner’s triumph is even more impressive when you consider Huddersfield’s budget ranked among the lowest in the second tier. AFP
