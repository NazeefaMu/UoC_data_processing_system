Open warrants on two

Open warrants were issued on two persons in a case against three individuals who entered the sigiriya sanctuary and made a trap to kill animals, by Dambulla District Judge and Magistrate Bandara Kulathunga on Tuesday.
Only the first suspect appeared before the court, while the second and third suspects who were on bail, were absent.
