Wigneswaran files appeal against  CA interim order

Former Supreme Court Judge and Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran has filed an appeal in the Supreme Court challenging the Court of Appeal’s Interim Order preventing his decision to remove B. Denishwaran from functioning as the Fisheries and Transport Minister in the province.
When the appeal petition was taken up before the Supreme Court three-judge-bench headed by Buwaneka Aluvihare, the matter was fixed for support on September 5.
The Court of Appeal last Monday (23) further extended its Interim Order till August 9, halting the decision of Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran to expel B. Denishwaran from functioning as the Fisheries and Transport Minister in the province.
President’s Counsel K. Kanageswaran appeared for Chief Minister Wigneswaran. Counsel Suren Fernando appeared for the petitioner.
