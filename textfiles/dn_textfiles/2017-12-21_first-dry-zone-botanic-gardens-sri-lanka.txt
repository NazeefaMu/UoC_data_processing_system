First dry-zone botanic gardens in Sri Lanka

The first ever dry-zone botanic gardens in Sri Lanka at Mirijjawila in Hambantota have gained wide popularity among environmentalists, botanists, sightseers, school children, teachers, scholars, and tourists from various countries around the globe. The construction work of the dry-zone botanic garden commenced on 20th July 2006.
This was the first time a botanic garden was set up in Sri Lanka after 130 years, the former Director General of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Cyril Wijesundera, said. A sum of Rs. 500 million was allocated for the development of the gardens, which is in extent of 300 acres. The first stage of the construction work came to a climax on 14th November 2013 and was opened for visitors. About eighty percent of the construction work of the second stage has been completed and the construction work will come to a climax in 2020.
The flower cultivation has become a money-spinner for growers and members of the flower-growers association formed by the botanic gardens. The dry-zone botanic gardens consist of plants, trees and herbal plants that are grown in the dry zone, a butterfly garden, a plant nursery, a student park, a plant conservation unit, a flower garden, and ornamental bushes. Sumith Ekanayaka, the officer in charge of the dry-zone botanic gardens, said that the director general of the Peradeniya Botanic Gardens, K.N.Yapa, is managing the dry zone botanic gardens under the guidance of the Ministry of Sustainable Development and Wildlife.
Sumith Ekanayaka said that there are three botanic gardens in Sri Lanka that are the creations of Englishmen, and that the dry-zone botanic gardens at Hambantota are the only ones set up by locals using local technology and expertise. The construction work of these botanic gardens commenced under the guidance of former Director General Wijesundera, who retired from the post some time ago.
