Nishanka Nanayakkara appointed Litro Gas Chairman

 
The Public Enterprise Development Ministry has appointed Attorney-at-Law Nishanka Nanayakkara as Chairman of the Litro Gas Lanka Ltd.
The announcement comes in the wake of the removal of Shalila Moonasinghe as Chairman on Wednesday (11).
The Criminal Investigation Division (CID) of the Police arrested Moonasinghe on October 9 for involvement in the hacking of the Taiwan Far Eastern Bank.
The Taiwan Far Eastern International Bank was hacked into and USD 1.1 million was wired to Moonasinghe’s personal account.
A team of investigators from Taiwan is currently in the country to probe the heist that saw USD 60 billion wired to locations such as Sri Lanka, Cambodia and the United States of America.
