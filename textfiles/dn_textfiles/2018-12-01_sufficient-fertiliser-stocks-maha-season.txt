Sufficient fertiliser stocks for Maha season

Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera has instructed the relevant authorities to supply fertiliser stocks required for farmers during the Maha Season without any delay or shortage.
A meeting to discuss the measures that need to be taken to provide the fertiliser subsidy without any delay or shortage for the farmers for the 2018 Maha season was held recently under the patronage of Minister Amaraweera with the participation of Ministry Secretary K.D.S.Ruwanchandra and some other officials.
During the meeting, a National Fertiliser Secretariat official informed the Minister that sufficient stocks of fertiliser have already been stored at the stores of the Commercial Fertilizer Company and the Ceylon Fertilizer Company.
Minister Amaraweera said more than 800,000 hectares of paddy lands have already been cultivated in the Maha season this year and instructed officials to provide opportunities for the farmers to purchase fertiliser without any inconvenience.
National Fertiliser Secretariat sources said 37,500 MTs of Urea, 150,000 MTs of Triple Super Phosphate (TSP) and 46,000 MTs of Muriate of Potash (MOP) are required for this Maha season.
