Respondents ordered to file objections in Geetha Kumarasinghe case

The Court of Appeal yesterday ordered the respondents including Parliamentarian Geetha Sanammali Kumarasinghe to file objections regarding a writ petition filed by five residents of the Galle District challenging the constitutionality of electing the actress as a Member of Parliament since she holds duel citizenship.
When the petition came up before Justice Vijith Malalgoda, counsel who appeared on behalf of Parliamentarian Geetha Kumarasinghe requested more time to file objections.
Meanwhile, counsel Pulasthi Rupasinghe with Lanka Dharmasiri appearing for UPFA General Secretary Prof. Vishwa Warnapala informed Court that his client would abide by any order made by Court.
Meanwhile, Justice Malalgoda observed that the Court would comprehensively look into this petition since it is a matter of public representative.
The petitioners had sought an order of writ of Quo Warranto declaring that MP Geetha Kumarasinghe is disqualified to be a Member of Parliament and thus not entitled to hold office as a Member of Parliament.
The petitioners N.W.E. Buwaneka of Beddegama, J.K. Amarawardhana of Yatalamatta, A.C. Gunasekara of Unawatuna, J.K. Wijesinghe of Ambalangoda and H.L. Prasanna Deepthilal of Galle maintained that Mrs. Kumarasinghe is a holder of duel citizenship, namely of Sri Lanka and Switzerland, who had contested the 2015 Parliament Election and had not divulged her duel citizenship at the time of submission nominations.
The petitioners cited Geetha Sanammali Kumarasinghe, Controller General of Immigration and Emigration M.N. Ranasinghe, UPFA General Secretary Prof. Vishwa Warnapala and Secretary General of Parliament Dhammika Dasanayake as respondents.
They stated that by virtue of Constitution in particular Section 20 of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, Article 91(1)(d)(xiii) she is not qualified to be elected as a Member of Parliament. The relevant provision stated that a citizen of Sri Lanka who is also a citizen of any other country shall not be qualified to be elected as a Member of Parliament or to sit and vote in Parliament.
The petitioners stated that due to public interviews of the first respondent published in the media, they were of the reasonable apprehensive that she was a holder of a duel citizenship and that she was a citizen of Switzerland.
