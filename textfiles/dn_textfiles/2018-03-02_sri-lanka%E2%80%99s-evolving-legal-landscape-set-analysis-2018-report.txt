Sri Lanka’s evolving legal landscape set for analysis in 2018 report

Sri Lanka’s efforts to create a more consistent legal framework, as part of a broader bid to boost foreign direct investment, will be explored in a report due out in the coming months by the global research and consultancy firm Oxford Business Group (OBG).
The Report: Sri Lanka 2018 will shine a spotlight on the country’s latest legislative developments, which include the implementation of the Inland Revenue Act and the Foreign Exchange Act.
OBG’s publication will also consider other legal reforms that could be on the horizon, such as possible changes to the country’s immigration laws covering the requirements of foreign nationals wishing to work in Sri Lanka.
John Wilson Partners has signed a third memorandum of understanding (MoU) with OBG for its forthcoming publication. Under the MoU, the firm will assist in the research for the Law Chapter of The Report: Sri Lanka 2018.
John Wilson, managing partner at the law firm, said he welcomed the opportunity to work with OBG’s team once again and describe to OBG’s readership the positive changes and legal reforms taking place in the country.
“While there are still remains a lot to be done in terms of reforms to Sri Lanka’s legal framework, business leaders considering the country as a potential investment destination will undoubtedly have questions relating to the current reforms, new laws and their application,” he said. “I am pleased to have been able to analyse these developments for Oxford Business Group’s readers and provide key insights to navigate their way through this evolving legislative landscape.”
Welcoming John Wilson Partners on board, OBG’s editorial manager in Sri Lanka, Michael Todemann, added that although Sri Lanka offered plenty of openings across its economy, inconsistencies in its legal framework had, at times, deterred investors.
“While there is still more to be done, new laws and others in the pipeline are important signs of progress,” he said. “John Wilson Partners are known to be local experts in their field, with an in-depth knowledge of Sri Lanka’s legal environment. I’m delighted that by establishing a long-term relationship with its team, we will continue to benefit from their input in this important part of our research.”
The Report: Sri Lanka 2018 will be a vital guide to the many facets of the country, including its macroeconomics, infrastructure, banking and other sectoral developments. The publication will also contain contributions from leading representatives, including: President Maithripala Sirisena; Greg Hands, the UK Minister of state for International Trade; and Changyong Rhee, Director of Asia and Pacific department for the IMF. It will be available in print and online.
The Report: Sri Lanka 2018 will be produced with the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, the Board of Investment, PwC, and John Wilson and Partners.
