New USAID Sri Lanka, Maldives Mission Director here

Reed J. Aeschliman assumed his duties as the new Mission Director of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) for Sri Lanka and Maldives on March 5. Aeschliman's arrival corresponds with the start-up of several new initiatives and more than 4.5 billion Sri Lankan rupees in programmes that advance youth employability, rule of law, and reconciliation in Sri Lanka.
"We are fortunate to have Aeschliman join the U.S. Embassy team as we celebrate 70 years of partnership between the United States and Sri Lanka," said U.S. Ambassador Atul Keshap. "The people of Sri Lanka and Maldives will benefit from his strong experience in managing USAID development assistance.
He will also ensure that funds provided by the American taxpayers are spent wisely in support of our shared goals to see Sri Lanka become a reconciled, peaceful and prosperous democracy that contributes to regional security and upholds fundamental human rights and equality for all". In Maldives, USAID has supported a wide range of initiatives since 2001, including safe and clean water for island residents, management of coastal resources, and strengthening the capacity of government institutions.
