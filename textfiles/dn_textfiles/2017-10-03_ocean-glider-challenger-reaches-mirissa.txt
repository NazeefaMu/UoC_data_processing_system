Ocean Glider Challenger reaches Mirissa

The Ocean Glider Challenger, which set sail for Sri Lanka in November last year from Western Australia, reached Mirissa on September 29. It was the longest journey ever attempted by an autonomous underwater vehicle.
The Glider had covered 7570 km in over 330 days (nearly 11 months), making it the longest ever glider transactor in history.
Finance State Minister Eran Wickramaratne said the data collected using the Challenge Ocean Glider would also help Sri Lanka overcome issues pertaining to ocean climate change.
He said Sri Lanka was chosen to play a significant part as the mission concerned collecting data on the Indian Ocean.
Minister Wickramaratne speaking at a press conference held in the Hilton Colombo said each year has been warmer than the previous year in Sri Lanka and added that there was also an acceleration in the occurrence of natural disasters.
He said the country need affordable, reliable energy and solar power was not a choice anymore.
“Let us not politicise these issues that concern the well-being of the country. Some countries have targets to go for renewable energy, a ban on fossil fuels and use of renewable energy on plantation and manufacturers. We also need to conserve biodiversity through policy and legislation, much is to be done,” the State Minister said.
According to University of Western Australia Professor of Coastal Oceanography Charitha Pattiaratchi, the Challenger Glider Mission had captured and communicated unprecedented undersea data, he said.
“It will help determine how changes in currents, temperatures and salinity affect weather patterns and give scientists a deeper understanding into the issues that raise due to changing climate,” he said.
He said they collect data across the ocean basins and compare the previous measurements to identify how ocean has changed.
Prof. Pattiaratchi said that previously data about ocean were gathered with the help of ships and the ocean glider was a more cost effective and efficient technology.
The ocean glider is the Teledyne Webb Slocum electric glider: a 2.2 metre autonomous underwater vehicle, which collects data as it moves through the ocean in a saw-tooth shaped trajectory, achieving a forward speed of 25 to 35 km per day. It captures continuous ocean readings and transmit it to researchers in near real-time via satellite network when the glider surfaces.
The ocean glider is to circumnavigate the rim of the Indian Ocean, taking a further two years.The endeavour is part of a partnership between the UWA and the Rutgers University under the auspices of the Australian Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) and the US Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS).
