'Statistics don't do Brendon McCullum justice'

One of cricket's most beguiling and brash careers will end soon. Well, kinda.
Inspirational New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum, who has been the catalyst for the Kiwis' ascension into prominence, will retire from international cricket after the test series against Australia in February. He will not play in the upcoming T20 World Cup.
Of course, he will not be lost to cricket. McCullum will cash in on the lucrative T20 scene, joining the likes of Kevin Pietersen and Chris Gayle on cricket's cashed-up carnival.
It was a decision that caught many by surprise, considering McCullum is still a relatively tender 34 years old - certainly not a geriatric in cricket terms.
We've been so used to seeing players trudge on well into their 30s, and even post 40, that retiring at the relatively modest age of 34 seems a tad early. And perhaps it is. But, importantly, McCullum wants to finish on top.
Unlike other athletes, who become a depressing shadow by the end of their careers, McCullum won't finish on that ignominy.
When he finishes up against Australia, he would have played 101 tests - all consecutive since his debut, an incredible feat that may stand the test of time (pardon the pun).
McCullum said of his decision: "I would have preferred to wait until the ANZ International Series in Christchurch to make this news public."
But he needed to accelerate the decision because of the potentially destabilising impact it may have on the team, ahead of an arduous period for the Black Caps.
Aggresive Leadership
McCullum will forever endure because of his ability to propel New Zealand into a powerhouse side. Since 2013, they have remained unbeaten at home in test series, and also memorably reached the ODI World Cup final earlier this year for the first time. Statistics don't do McCullum justice.
He doesn't average more than 40 in any of the three formats. From 99 tests, he has scored a modest 11 centuries and averages 38 - a lowish figure considering the batting-dominated era he has been part of.
He once scored a triple hundred, demonstrating he could play the long haul, but it was not a characteristic he showed often enough.
But he's so much more than mere stats.
McCullum resonates because of his brutish batting and aggressive leadership, which transformed a previously plucky but limited New Zealand outfit.
His leadership has been dynamic, even though some - notably Ian Chappell during the recent test series in Australia - criticised him for being too audacious at times. McCullum's batting was always risky, but the sound of his bat hitting the leather ball was incredibly satisfying, and awe-inspiring seeing it smashed out of the ground.
Sublime
Small in height, but built like a boxer, the pocket-sized dynamo has been an attraction due to his performance and courage.
Being bold was something innate in McCullum. The smasher, dasher and chaser adopted a kind of madcap, reckless approach very much in the Gilchrist and Sehwag mode, although he was not as good as those modern master blasters.
