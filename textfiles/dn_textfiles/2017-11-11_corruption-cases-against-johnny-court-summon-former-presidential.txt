The defence had raised objections urging to release Fernando from the cases citing that the investigative officer who carried out investigations into the incident had failed to initiate a comprehensive investigation.
Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara maintained that the order regarding an objection raised by defence to be delivered after recording evidence from several witnesses including former Secretary to the President. The cases were fixed for January 11.
The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed charges against the former Minister in the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court under Section 9 of the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law No. 1 of 1975 for not declaring assets and liabilities at the Presidential Secretariat.
