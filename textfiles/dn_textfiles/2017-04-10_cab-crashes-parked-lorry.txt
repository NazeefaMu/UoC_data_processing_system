Cab crashes into parked lorry

A double cab plying along the Colombo-Puttalam road crashed into a lorry parked at Mudithagama, Nochchiyagama on April 7.
The impact had pushed the lorry to a distance of 20-metres and crashed against a high voltage electricity pylon breaking it into two. The accident resulted in interrupting the electricity supply in the area around 11.30 p.m.
The van driver, Gihan Weeratunge (36), a resident of the Anuradhapura Stage 2 area, sustained minor injuries and was admitted to the Nochchiyagama Hospital, Nochchiyagama police said.
The lorry transporting a refrigerator to Vavuniya had been parked by the wayside, while its driver had gone to a nearby hotel when the accident occurred.
Investigations are continuing.
