Govt should act to solve SAITM issue by Monday: GMOA

The Government should implement solutions in connection with the SAITM issue by next Monday to avoid a countrywide strike, Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) Media spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda said.
Addressingthe media at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the Health Minister should gazette the minimum standards of the medical education and legalise the technical report issued on SAITM by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC).
Dr. Ananda said the Higher Education Minister should inform the Judiciary that SAITM has not obtained the Compliance Certificate from the SLMC which is a must to become a degree awarding institution. Recruiting students to SAITM should be stopped, he said. Offering degrees by SAITM should be stopped.
A committee should be appointed to solve the SAITM issue by providing a solution accepted by the SLMC.
GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said no one is against solving the issue of the students of SAITM, but all are against the way of certain politicians who try to solve it.
