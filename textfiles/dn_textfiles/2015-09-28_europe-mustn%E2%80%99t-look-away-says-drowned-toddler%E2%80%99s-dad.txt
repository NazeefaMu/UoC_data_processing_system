Europe mustn’t look away, says drowned toddler’s dad

GERMANY: The father of drowned Syrian toddler Aylan Kurdi says it was appropriate for news organisations to run photos showing his son lying dead on a Turkish beach.
“People must not look away from the terrible things happening on the way to Europe just because we cannot get a visa,” Abdullah Kurdi told Germany's Bild newspaper on Saturday.
Aylan drowned in early September with his 5-year-old brother and their mother off Turkey as they were trying to make the sea crossing to Greece.
The pictures of Aylan appeared on newspaper front pages around the globe, highlighting the scale of the humanitarian crisis created by the Syrian civil war. The conflict has forced more than 4 million people to flee abroad.
Speaking from the northern Iraqi town of Erbil, Mr Kurdi said he can only look at the photos “very briefly” before he is overwhelmed with emotion.
Kurdi has previously said he wants the whole world to see what happened to his family after their small boat sunk in the Mediterranean.
“We want the world's attention on us, so they can prevent the same from happening to others. Let this be the last.” The Kurdi family are Syrian Kurds from Kobane, a city in northern Syria near the border with Turkey that was under siege by the Islamic State group last year, forcing thousands to flee.
The bodies of the three Kurdi family members who perished in the Mediterranean were buried in Kobane.
