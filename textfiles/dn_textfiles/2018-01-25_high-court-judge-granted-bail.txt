High Court judge granted bail

The case against a High Court judge who was arrested for allegedly killing a woman in a road accident was taken up at the Wariyapola Magistrate’s Court yesterday.
Wariyapola Acting Magistrate Srimathee Rajapaksa ordered that the suspect be released on personal bail worth Rs. 200,000 and to suspend his driving license for three months.
The car driven by the suspect hit Mahesha Sandamali, a 35-year-old woman who was riding a motorcycle with her 17-year-old daughter who sustained serious injuries and was admitted to the Kurunegala Teaching Hospital.
The suspect has volunteered to provide compensation for the death and to assist in the educational needs of the two children of the deceased. The case will be heard again on April 5, 2018.
