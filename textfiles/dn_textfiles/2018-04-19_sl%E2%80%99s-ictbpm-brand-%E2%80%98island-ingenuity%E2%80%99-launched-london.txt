Sri Lanka’s IT industry has emerged and become globally competitive due to the unique talents of the workforce, the focus on high quality and reliability, but above all - ingenuity and creativity.

Virtusa, the global IT services provider employs over 3,000 staff in Sri Lanka. Other examples of global organisations with their captive centers in Sri Lanka include HSBC, the London Stock Exchange Group and Pearson.
Increasingly, global companies are choosing to locate their R&D centres in Sri Lanka.

It now employs over 600 people. IFS, the Swedish enterprise software provider, employs over 1,000 staff in R&D, product engineering, business consulting and product support roles.
These companies experience a type of ingenuity and creativity which is unique to Sri Lanka, a location for innovative software product development and ideal for captive R&D centres that produce creative solutions that are world-class but cost-effective.
While Sri Lanka may be small in size, the industry has proven its ability to deliver high-value in each of these areas.
