New railway timetable from next month

A new railway timetable, updated after eleven years, will be available to the public for purchase from main railway stations from next month.
Sri Lanka Railways (SLR) has printed a new time table taking into account the increased number of train services, newly added railway stations and increased frequencies. Currently, 396 trains and 25 rail buses run daily on all railway routes. SLR General Manager B.A.P. Ariyarathne said seven trains operate daily between Badulla and Colombo Fort and the public has requested for additional trains. We are considering their requests at the moment,” he said.
The Railway Department has taken steps to distribute new railway timetables among train engineers, guards and other officials involved in train operations. The first copy of the new time table was handed over to the Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva by SLR General Manager B.A.P. Ariyarathne at the Ministry premises.
