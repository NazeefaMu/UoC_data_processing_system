Drops of Youth:  the  perfect go-to pollution solution

The Drops of Youth Liquid Peel and the Drops of Youth Fresh Emulsion are the newest additions to the extensive range at The Body Shop stores in Sri Lanka. These 100% vegan youth enhancing solutions are designed for skin that is regularly exposed to polluted environment, making them the perfect go-to pollution solution for city dwellers.
The first is the Drops of Youth Liquid Peel to tackle pollutants that penetrate the deeper layers of skin, causing the breakdown of collagen.
The transforming gel-to-peel technology and revolutionary texture of the product traps and gently lifts impurities, fine pollutants and dead skin cells to reveal fresher and more youthful looking skin.
88% of respondents conducting a self-assessment after using the product agreed that it peeled off impurities and left their skin feeling purified.
The Drops of Youth Fresh Emulsion with SPF 20 protection is an emulsion that can be used daily to help protect against pollution and enhance the skin’s youthful appearance.
By infusing thyme and buddleia extract and a broad spectrum of UVA and UVB filters, this powerful but ultra-light formula hydrates skin and can be used as or in addition to daily moisturizer.
This protection can be enhanced with the Skin Defence range’s Multi Protection Essence, which brings a more considerable SPF 50 protection to the table.
The products are available at The Body Shop flagship store on Bagatale Road and Odel on Alexandra Place.
