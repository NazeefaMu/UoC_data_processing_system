Teenager abused over 15 times

A 14-year-old girl who decamped from a children’s home in Galle and was working at a shoe factory in Colombo was arrested by the officers of the Child and Women’s Bureau of the Galle Police and produced before the Galle Additional Magistrate.
Considering the submissions by the police, the Additional Magistrate ordered the girl to be sent to another children’s home until the probation officers found an appropriate children’s detention home for her. Police told the court that the girl had been detained at the children’s home in Galle on court order as she was reported to have been sexually abused on 16 occasions earlier. The police further said that there were five pending cases at the Morawaka Magistrate’s Court and another five cases at the Matara Magistrate’s Court in respect of alleged cases of sexual abuse of the girl.
It was further submitted that at the time of the arrest of the girl for the second time, she was found to have been living together with a man who took her with him when she reached Colombo after fleeing from children’s home on February 28. However, a woman who volunteered to help her had found her employment at the shoe factory.
Affterwards, as the girl had informed her mother about her new location, her mother had brought her back home and notified the police. The police then took the girl into their custody and produced her before court.
Galle Division Child and Women’s Bureau OIC IP A. Algewatte and Galle Police Child and Women’s Bureau OIC SI Chaudri with Sgt. Samaranayake are conducting further investigations on the instructions of Galle HQI Ajith Kumara.
