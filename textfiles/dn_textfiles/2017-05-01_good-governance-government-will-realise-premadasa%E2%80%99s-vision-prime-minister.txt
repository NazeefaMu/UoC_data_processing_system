Good-governance government will realise Premadasa’s vision: Prime Minister

The good-governance government will be able to realize national reconciliation and Sri Lankan identity, which were the former President R. Premadasa’s hope for Sri Lanka, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today, at a ceremony to mark the 24th commemoration of former president, R. Premadasa.
At the ceremony held before the R. Premadasa statue in Hultsdorf, Colombo, the Prime Minister referred to a speech made by the former president Premadasa, in which he said “If I was able to become the President of Sri Lanka, anybody can.”
He pointed out that former President Premadasa meant no Sri Lankan should be discriminated due to their ethnicity or other differences.
“The former President Premadasa was born out of the people. He dedicated himself for the people and he demised among people. His death is marked by the May Day which represents people,” PM Wickremesinghe further said.
Premier Wickremesinghe also said the international community had Sri Lanka marginalized due to the spread of racism, religious conflicts and political hatred within the country, in the few years after the end of war. 
He pointed out the previous regime developed an antagonistic stance against the international arena instead of working with them. It was in a backdrop as such, the joint government headed by President Maithripala Sirisena came into being, the Premier pointed out. 
The international community has given Sri Lanka two years to deliver a national solution to the ethnic issue and boost national reconciliation process in the country, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
Premier Wickremesinghe said an interim report by the Constitutional Council is in the making regarding a national solution and that extensive discussions are being held regarding the matter with all religious leaders and the civil society.
The Primier also said rounds of discussions are being held regarding devolution of power while ensuring the integrity and the sovereignty of Sri Lanka. He also said human rights, election system and freedom of religious practices are topics that have been discussed in length as well.
