Sajith pledges to resolve construction sector’s issues

Housing Construction and Cultural Affairs Minister Sajith Premadasa said the government will resolve the issues of the construction sector.
The Minister was addressing the gathering at a ceremony held to present National Awards for Construction on Thursday at BMICH. The best performed local and foreign construction companies were selected for the awards.
The construction and industrial sectors have huge potential to be major income generation fields, he said.
Minister Premadasa said the proposed Construction Development Fund (CDF) will be set up promptly. The CDF will provide social security, status and acceptance for the sector, he said.
The Minister said the government has taken measures to increase the skilled work force for the construction sector.
“Under this move, 12,000 youths were trained for the construction sector. We do not need foreign labour now. It is our duty to produce nhuman resource for the sector,” he said.
With enough human capital, the construction and industrial sectors can be developed as key income generation sources. Producing human capital is rather important to achieve economic development, he said.
The Minister said the government will protect entrepreneurs and pledged that he will take every possible measure with the assistance of the government to strengthen the local construction sector.
“Strengthening and safeguarding the construction sector is a main duty of the government,” the Minister noted. “Fifty two per cent of the GDP is used by the 20 per cent of the richest persons of the country while the 20 per cent of the poorest persons use only 4 per cent.
The rulers must bridge the gap. They are responsible for the gap,” he added.
The country’s economy should enhance social justice, the Minister said.
