Dematagala tank slated for renovation

A programme for the renovating dilapidated tanks and canals will be undertaken by the Anuradhapura District Secretariat office with the support of the irrigation, forest conservation, wildlife and other departments.
Anuradhapura Government Agent R.M. Wanninayake told the Daily News that under these programmes special attention has been focused on the ancient Dematagala irrigational project located in the Palagala DS division. The programme will be implemented in two phases. Under the first phase, it is proposed to fully renovate the Dematagala tank which was constructed with a dam across Moragolla Oya. The water capacity of the Dematagala tank is 1000 a.f.
Wanninayake said that under the Dematagala tank, 32 smaller tanks could be provided with water. Under the second phase of the project, the ancient anicuit across the Hawan Ela is to be renovated and a feeder canal of nearly 5 km from this point up to the Dematagala tank is to be constructed.
Once the work is over, 1,380 acres of paddy could be cultivated in the Maha season, while during the Yala season, 500 acres could be cultivated with paddy and additional crops. Nearly 1,800 farmer families will benefit.
It will help to minimise the human - elephant conflict which has been developing in this zone. Rajangana irrigation engineer's office will coordinate the project and estimates for the construction work in relation to the project are being prepared. Anuradhapura Zonal Irrigation Director Prasanna Silva said that the wild elephant threat is to be addressed before start the project.
He said that one has to walk nearly 3 km through thick forest from Kahalla to the Dematagala tank area; as such the first step will be the construction of a suitable approach road from Kahalla junction to the Dematagalla tank site.
