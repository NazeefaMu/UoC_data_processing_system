Senanayake’s death marks the passing of an era

The death of veteran author and teledrama scriptwriter Somaweera Senanayake at the age of 74, on Saturday, marked the passing of an era in the genre of the local teledrama, for which the master scriptwriter was best known.
After the introduction of television in Sri Lanka in the late 1970s, Senanayake’s name was immortalised with such classics as Kandegedara, Doo Daruwo, Palingu Menike, Asal Wesiyo, and Yasho Raawaya. For the generations who were introduced to Sinhala television with these popular teledramas, his death marks the passing of an era.
Senanayake also wrote the scripts for classic films such as Mihidum Sihina and Ammawarune.
He was born in 1944 and had his primary education at a mixed junior school in Kudagama.
He received his secondary education at Seethawaka Central Colledge in Awissawella and Rajasinghe College in Ruwanwella.
Senanayake began contributing articles to newspapers and magazines while at secondary school.
He entered the Sri Jayewardenepura University, then called Vidyodaya University, in the beginning of the 1960s. After obtaining an Art’s degree, he joined the Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Limited (Lake House) as a journalist. His maiden novel Yasho Raawaya, later transformed into a popular teledrama, won the State Awards in 1978.
Senanayake died at a private hospital in Colombo, while being treated for a heart ailment.
