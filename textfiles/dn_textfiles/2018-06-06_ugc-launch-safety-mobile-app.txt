In keeping with the University Grants Commission’s (UGC) stand of zero tolerance of all forms of violence, the UGC, in collaboration with the ICTA, has developed a mobile application for university students and staff to be used in emergency situations of violence, including ragging and Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV).
This mechanism, as part of the Grievance Handling Mechanisms at the UGS, will be launched on June 6 from 9 am to 10.30 am at the UGC auditorium, under the patronage of Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapaksa as the chief guest and Higher Education and Cultural Affairs State Minister Mohan Lal Grero as the Guest of Honour.
It will be participated by Vice Chancellors, Deputy Vice-Chancellors, Registrars, Deans of all 15 universities, Rectors of three campuses and other university staff.
