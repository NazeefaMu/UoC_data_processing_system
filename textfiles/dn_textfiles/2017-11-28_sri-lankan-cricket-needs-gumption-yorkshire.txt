Sri Lankan cricket needs the gumption of Yorkshire

Fortunes fluctuated drastically for the Sri Lankan’s in the recent Test match against India which was played on the 15th of November 2017 in Calcutta. They saved the match by the skin of their teeth. True it was a gripping match till the weather gods intervened, but the truth of the matter was Virat Kohli and his band of marauders nearly decapitated our feeble batting line up.
I was an avid follower of not only Test cricket but county cricket as well throughout the seventies in England. Then Yorkshire the county situated in the north of England stood head and shoulders above the rest when it came to guts.
J.M. Kilburn’s book ‘Over throws’ gives a vivid description of this county’s gumption. He stated that Yorkshire cricket is accorded by the cricketing world in general a quality of its own. The reputation, being of practical benefit is welcomed by Yorkshiremen who have come to guard and emphasized it, even to an extent of accepting some of the less desirable by-products. Yorkshire cricket was supposed to be played the ‘hard way’, with competitive success a primary concern. It was seen as determined batting and painstaking bowling; as cricket of serious mien and an unsympathetic, not to say contemptuous, view of failure and misfortune. In short, the message is ‘They don’t play cricket for fun’ stated Kilburn. Yorkshiremen do not find their cricket fun in a purposeless past time, in idle occupation with hit or miss experiment in involving no consequence. They do find ‘fun’ in the struggles of cricket, the endeavour towards successful batting and bowling techniques, the outwitting of opponents, the satisfaction of ability displayed and potential realised. The worst failing a Yorkshire cricketer can, show to Yorkshiremen is the slap-happy, thoughtless attitude. The fun of the game comes from solving its problems, from treating it with respect as a worthwhile undertaking and of course from winning.
The Indian cricket set up should learn something from the following:
By repute Yorkshire cricket lays too much emphasis on winning. The Yorkshire retort would be ‘Are both sides not trying to win then? Was the contest arranged on an intention to determine who would win?’ There is right and wrong in both arguments. No team, no individual, can lay too much emphasis on winning as a desirable and fundamental objective, provided endeavour remains within the legal and moral framework of play. Teams and individuals would be uncomplimentary to opponents, to spectators and to self-responsibility were they compete without trying to win. The Olympics claim that it’s more important to take part than to win needs extension; the greater importance is to take part in an endeavour to win by acceptable means.
Virat Kohli and his coterie were jumping like jack rabbits after each and every ball not to get the Lankan batsmen by legal means but to prise out the umpires forefinger from the safety of his pocket, at times the demands were so great that the umpires finger came out of his pocket so fast that he could have beaten the fastest draw in Texas, all this drama was only to be nullified by the DSR much to the chagrin of the Indian players, some of them would have been better off with a couple of valiums to calm their nerves.
Kilburn also emphasised the fact that in Yorkshire philosophy of sport;
It is impossible to be too keen on winning a competitive engagement.
The desire to win is unalloyed.
Some practises arising from the virtue can tarnish it - cheating is an obvious example.
Manipulation of the rules and customs to an opponent’s disadvantage Instigation and cultivation of a disagreeable atmosphere (the Aussies are past masters, but the Indians are on their heels watch out!)
Most of us I suspect have stepped into the grey area at some time or other in our sporting behaviour; have sought an advantage by unwarrantable appeal, by wasting time (Mohamed Sami vs Niroshan Dickwella) this is a practice honed if not sharp. In the ultimate assessment Kilburn stated that all should seek mercy rather than justice.
The Yorkshire reputation for playing hard cricket was not acceptable to them as an accusation of approving the grey area. W.G. Grace was not a Yorkshireman, but he had his little ways, D.R. Jardine was not a Yorkshireman, nor was ‘bodyline’ bowling a Yorkshire conception.It was not a Yorkshire bowler who shouldered a running batsman to the ground in a Lord’s Test match. Yorkshire cricket has received public rebuke for misconduct on the field and in the dressing room, but Yorkshire cricket authority has invariably acknowledged error and sought correction recalled Kilburn.
During the recent 1st Test match played against India at Calcutta, the Lankans kept the Indians on the ropes for much of the time, and if it was a boxing match we would have won on points.
Although we were floored by that man Virat Kohli and then struggled against the ropes with the impacts of vicious left hooks and upper cuts delivered by Kumar and Sami our cricketers staggered into the dressing room with wounds and cuts and half swollen eyes, although the eyes were swollen they were not completely shut and that is why they could see through the gloom and save the match for Sri Lanka.
I felt that the atmosphere, the crowds and the antics of the Indian fielders, Kohli in particular, could have put both Sharuk and Salman Khan in the shade, with his antics.
Not to worry Virat there is another glittering career that awaits you once you leave the sacred turf and for the opposing bowlers’ sake, it should be sooner than later. What a glorious innings the only hitch so to say was, there was not enough icing put on the cake. Well done mate being an Asian, I am proud of you.
