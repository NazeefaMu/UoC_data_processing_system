Mystical Thanthirimale

Cut off for three decades by the countries civil war Thanthirimale has taken on an almost mystic persona over the centuries with its boulders hiding ancient carved Buddha’s and a golden bat necklace lost in the sands of time. Juliet Coombe went in search of this legendary spot and was deeply moved by this sacred haven.
The ancient site
Hewn out of solid rock
Thanthirimale 40 kms northeast of the city of Anuradhapura in the north central dry plains of Sri Lanka is a stunning sacred spot that still fascinates all that visit this sacred site. All who make this special pilgrimage comment on the scenic drive through rural countryside that takes you to the heart of Thanthirimale, an old village in the Anuradhapura District of Sri Lanka.
The name means place of the bat necklace. It is believed that a piece of jewellery of this description was hidden at a secret spot in the rock carved area about 2,300 years ago when the temple complex was built. Today local people still enjoy speculating on where it is, the size and the amount of gold used. The army who are based there have many an interesting story to tell about this legendary priceless piece.<U+2028>
Large granite boulders on a bend in the road create a natural entrance to this hidden gem of a village. It feels like you are travelling into another world, as it is so isolated and remote from the rest of the country. As you walk into the ancient site you are greeted by a grey granite moonscape littered with simple hand chiselled temple structures, lakes full of lotus, seated and reclining Buddha’s hewn by hand tools out of rock faces and intriguing Brahmin inscriptions etched on the walls of meditation caves, which can be reached by a short walk through the forest. Each one with an important message impart on all those pilgrims who decide to go there at least once in their lifetime.<U+2028>
Fascinating area
The walled Bodhi tree, a sapling of the 2,500-year-old tree at Anuradhapura, is planted at one of the highest points. Test out its magical properties by walking around it and you may be granted eight wishes from good fortune to special fertility rights. Just remember to use each one well. The ancient Buddhist temple situated in a nearby rocky covered area is considered by the local village people to be Sri Maha Bodhi, which was brought from India to Sri Lanka, one night along the way the pot containing the sapling was kept at Thantheremale as it was then called. It is believed that there was one branch separately grew from the pot, was planted at that village to remember the incident. Some believe that this may be the first Sri Maha Bhodi plant in Sri Lanka. Whether it is or not the place is truly spectacular with Buddha’s beautifully carved out of the giant boulders and pretty water spots make idyllic places to sit and contemplate the meaning of life, or if you are an artist a magical space to draw or do watercolours.
There is an archaeological museum at the site and some quirky little street sellers with all sorts of interesting local delicacies including squashed bat. This of course is a little joke and when you open up the green leaves there is all manner of delicious picnic style curries. As per the historical evidence being currently dug up this fascinating area is one of the oldest human settlements in Sri Lanka, which dates back according to archaeologists to pre 6th century BC, when Prince Vijaya and his men set foot on the island at a spot that came to be called Thambapanni, meaning bronze sand. A place full of mystics and magic, one can’t help but feel the Thanthirimale charm that fills the air and enjoy the delicious village food that you will be pleased to hear does not included golden fried bat.
Bring your gold detector, a sense of adventure and enjoy one of the Islands great rock wonders. As one of the most incredible Sacred Cities it’s sure to cast its spell on you and for those who want to get away from the usual cultural triangle sites, there is something very spiritual and geographically unusual about Thanthirimale and its religious rock complex of temples and buddha carvings that makes a truly unforgettable place.
