Authentically academic

Title: Academic Challenges and Reflections
Author: Dr Gemunu Siri Gamage
This book is a collection of articles and poems published by Dr Gemunu Siri Gamage in the daily and Sunday newspapers, for a number of years. It has thirty four articles and ten poems worth reading especially by the intelligentsia in the country.
The newspaper articles are generally considered non-academic. Therefore, they are not taken into account in promotions of the Universities and the Institutes. This is a worldwide phenomenon. However, the articles collected in this book are quite different from the articles generally published in the newspapers. The reason for this is that the articles in this book are scholarly, controversial and research related.
The articles of the book deal with a variety of subjects written on various fields of academic interest. Among them the noteworthy subject areas are history, grammar, Buddhist Studies, education, biographical sketches, aesthetics, Sinhala literature (ancient and modern), anthropology, sociology and linguistics. This showed the versatility of the author. These articles cannot be written by a person who is not well versed in various oriental and occidental languages. I personally know that Dr Gemunu Siri Gamage has a thorough knowledge of Pali and Sanskrit in addition to the Sinhala language and of English too. His ac academic qualifications stand testimony to this effect. My point here is that the articles collected in the book could not have been written by a pseudo-scholar, as many books written, especially in Sinhala language, in modern Sri Lanka. There are those who begin their career by publishing a book or two. Dr Gamage reminds us of them with the lesson that genuine knowledge of languages, Liberal Arts and an experience running through many decades are necessary to write a book of quality which would bring knowledge and authority in academic fields.
Most of the articles found in this book transcend the traditional ideas and concepts believed for centuries in Sri Lanka. Therefore, all articles written by Dr Gamage and collected in this book lead us to a world of new facts hitherto unknown even for the scholars. Articles 1, 3, 5, 6, 10, 11, 18 and 27 are specifically noteworthy in this regard. Dr Gamage unravels the hidden information, historical or otherwise, which would shake our knowledge. I give below some of the new concepts that Dr Gamage emphasizes in this book.
1. The name of Sri Lanka itself indicates our relationship to the clan of Yakkhas.
2. the authorship of the Paritta discourses cannot be attributed to the Buddha.
3. the colloquial Sinhalese can be evaluated as a source of Anthropology.
4. Prince Rahula belongs to the Raghuvamsa, a lineage of Kings well known in the Indian traditions.
5. The Jatakas as the ultimate example of the tradition of Buddhist Poetry can be well established.
6. The relationship between the early inhabitants of Sri Lanka and the Australian aborigines is a historical fact based on the linguistic evidence.
7. The correct meaning of the Pali term ‘Migava’ and its importance in relation to the story of King Devanampiyatissa is emphasized.
8. The Sinhalese term ‘gani’ derives not from the Sanskrit term but from the Greek term ‘gyne’.
Dr Gamage has paid attention to felicitate well-known figures who lived in the recent past of Sri Lanka. They are Sarathchandra, Manawasinghe and Ven Medauyangoda Wimalakirthi. The unknown information of these great individuals are beautifully presented by Dr Gamage in this book. His personal experiences too are presented in evaluating the greatness of these scholars. These biographical sketches seem to be a source of information which would enhance the inquisitive nature of any individual of present Sri Lanka. Dr Gamage’s thirst for knowledge at the early years of his career is well documented in these articles. In this regard, I would like to mention that the literature of Biographies occupies a major branch of information especially in the Western World. Dr Gamage’s small effort towards this expanding branch of literature should be appreciated. Writing of Biographies was not considered as an essential part of Literature in ancient Sri Lanka. Dr Gamage has gone against the traditional approach here, as he had done elsewhere too in this book.
This book becomes richer by the message of the Most Ven Ittapana Dhammalankara. In addition the short appreciation of Professor Saman Chandra Ranasinghe and the introduction given by Professor K N O Dharmadasa adorn the book. Their coming forward to evaluate this collection of articles itself indicates how much Dr Gamage has contributed to expand our knowledge.
Finally, I would like to state with firm conviction that the Academic Challenges and Reflections is a source of information and knowledge beneficial to the nation which does not know where it should go. All those who are sensitive to various historical, literary and linguistic aspects of modern Sri Lanka should read this book.
