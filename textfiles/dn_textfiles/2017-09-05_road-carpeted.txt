Road carpeted

A road in Puttalam Sirambiyadi Manaveri area which was in a poor condition for a long time has been reconstructed as a carpet road, under the fund allocation made by Irrigation and Water Management State Minister Palitha Range Bandara.
The State Minister officially inaugurated the road for public use on September 2. He not only helped reconstruct the road, but also launched a bus service on the same day. Puttalam Police station Anura Gunawardana and others participated.
