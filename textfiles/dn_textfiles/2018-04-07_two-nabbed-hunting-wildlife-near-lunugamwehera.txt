Two nabbed for hunting wildlife near Lunugamwehera

Two persons were taken into custody by Thanamalwila Kitulkote wildlife officials for hunting wildlife at Kirindioya, Galrena, close to the border of the Lunugamwehera reserve, on Thursday.
They were taken in with 30 kg of hunted flesh and two locally produced firearms.
The operation was carried out by wildlife officials on a tip-off about a wildlife hunting racket.
Three people had been loading the flesh of wildlife into a three-wheeler when the wildlife officials arrived. One person managed to flee while the other two were taken into custody.
Officials said investigations are underway to nab the third suspect.
