Palisena grilled on PTL CALL recording system

The Treasury Bond Commission yesterday directed a series of questions at Perpetual Treasuries Limited CEO Kasun Palisena on the call recording system installed at his company.
Earlier, Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunathillake pointed out to the Commission that three other entities had provided the Commission with proper recordings inclusive of information on dates, numbers and duration.
He questioned as to why Perpetual Treasuries could not do so. He said that the investigating officers were being overloaded with information by Perpetual Treasuries.
Chairman of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating into the Treasury bond issue, Supreme Court Judge K.T. Chitrasiri asked Palisena if it is possible for the PTL to provide telephone call recordings corresponding to specific transactions which are probe worthy.
PTL CEO Kasun Palisena informed the Chairman of the PCoI, he will have to speak with the PTL IT department. He also said it might be possible to do so but approximately one month time will be taken to go through all the recordings.
Palisena also said the call recording system does not identify incoming or outgoing calls separately or the caller numbers.
Justice Chitrasiri then asked Palisena if the telephone recording system provides a facility to filter specific transactions, to which Palisena said he will have to check it with his IT expert.
Justice Chitrasiri pointed out Palisena that he was given sufficient time to attend to the matter.
Counsel for PTL Nihal Fernando pointed out to the PCoI that “it will take so many months” to go through all the recordings and find specific conversations corresponding to specific transactions.
Chairman Chitrasiri told Fernando PC to “allow him (Palisena) to answer the questions. He is the CEO of the company.”
Palisena then explained how the telephone calls are recorded and saved in folders named accordingly to dates.
According to Palisena the telephone call recording system was installed in June 2015, under his supervision and the instruction of his IT team.
Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunatilake at several occasions has pointed out to the commissioners that voice recordings provided by the PTL only have dates but no other specific details. DSG Gunatilake has also pointed out to the PCoI that when bank of Ceylon and Pan Asia Banking Cooperation provided the PCoI with call recordings, no such difficulties occurred.
DSG Gunatilake has several times suggested that the PTL is trying to overload them with information which will not assist the PCoI when investigating.
Counsel to Palisena later on informed the PCoI that they will provide answers to the series of questions directed at his client through an affidavit.
