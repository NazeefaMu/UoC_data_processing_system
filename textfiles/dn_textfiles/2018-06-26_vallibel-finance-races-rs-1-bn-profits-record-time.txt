Vallibel Finance Races to Rs 1 bn in profits in record time

Vallibel Finance PLC raced to over Rs 1 billion in net profits and gross profit of Rs. 1.9 billion, probably one of the quickest to the milestone, in what has been 11 years of epoch-making highs in growth, stability, stature and accolades.
The company’s meteoric rise from small beginnings to joining Sri Lankan business heavy-weights vindicates business tycoon Dhammika Perera’s confidence in naming the company as the name-bearer of the Vallibel Group.
In yet another remarkable year for the high-riding pace-setter, Vallibel Finance completed a resoundingly successful rights issue of over Rs.1 Billion which established and strengthened the capital base. Vallibel Finance PLC announced its income statement for the financial year ended on 31 March, 2018, recording growth across key indicators including income and profitability.Gross income for the financial year grew 35% over the previous year to reach Rs.6.9 billion, a figure that spoke eloquently of the company’s continuing ascendency with the previous year’s income at Rs.5.1 billion. Net interest income accounted for a 38% increase over the previous year’s figure, reaching Rs.2.7 billion from Rs.1.9 billion.
Operating profits for the year under review grew exponentially by 43% to Rs.1.9 billion from the previous Rs.1.3 billion. Net profit amassed to Rs.1 billion, growing by 40.3% on the back of outstanding performance built on prudent financial stewardship. Net profits for the previous year stood at Rs.726 million thus leading the company pass the billion rupee milestone in profits.
Deposits grew by 24% to Rs. 22.2 billion over the previous year’s Rs.17.8 billion. The milestone assumes even more significance when considering the highly competitive nature of deposits mobilization. “we have been able to record impeccable performance, both qualitative and quantitative during a very challenging and daunting period of time”, Jayantha Rangamuwa, Managing Director of Vallibel Finance.
Meanwhile, assets climbed to Rs.38.4 billion from the previous Rs.30.6 billion, accounting to a growth of 25.2%. “Vallibel Finance far exceeded the lofty ideals we set when we chose it to carry the group’s name. Today, it’s not only the pace-setter in the finance industry but an extraordinary role-model in business stewardship, building brand equity, withering the forces and creating wealth for all stakeholders”, Dhammika Perera.
