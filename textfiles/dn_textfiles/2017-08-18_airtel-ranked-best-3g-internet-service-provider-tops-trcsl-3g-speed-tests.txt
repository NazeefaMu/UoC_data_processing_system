Airtel ranked best 3G internet service provider: Tops TRCSL 3G speed tests for 6 consecutive publications

The TRC conducts monthly tests on internet speed of internet service providers and based on the latest published results for 3G speeds (www.trc.gov.lk) Airtel is the fastest mobile internet service provider in the country recording a maximum data speed of 24.2 Mbps and an average speed of 12.4 Mbps.
Sri Lankan smart phone user on an average spends 3 hours a day using the internet. Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) monthly speed test has become the benchmark by which discerning customers make their choice for an internet service provider. The last round of speed tests commenced from November 2016 and has shown Bharti Airtel Lanka as the Sri Lanka’s fastest 3G internet service provider for the 6th consecutive publication, a feat not achieved by any network since the inception of the speed tests.
Commenting on the on the results, Jinesh Hegde CEO of Airtel Lanka said, “The use of mobile devices have shifted prominently from making calls to the use of data. We at Airtel having seen these signs a couple of years ago we continuously invested towards amazing customer online experience with the deployment of technologies resulting in a 40% increase in speeds. Our engineers work around the clock to ensure we keep to these standards and it is testament of their hard work. We will continue to improve our online customer experience in keeping with our organization’s mission of enriching lives of our community”
Airtel’s success story lies in its adaptation of advanced technological application to generate high speed data delivery. Airtel incorporates ‘Smart Cache Technology’ which regularly stores the frequently used content of a customer in local servers instead of off shore servers. This method not only enables Airtel to deliver content much faster to customers, as it eliminates external interruptions. In addition, Airtel uses ‘Dual Carrier Technology’ which uses 2 channels for data transfer, doubling the internet speeds to offer hassle-free user experience exclusively for the Airtel customers.
