Melbourne merriment

The 69th anniversary of Independence of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka was celebrated at the Box Hill Town Hall in Melbourne on February 4 under the auspices of the Consulate General of Sri Lanka in Victoria in collaboration with friends and well-wishers. It is delighting to note that these celebrations in Melbourne are known to be the largest, well organised and presented National Day event staged anywhere outside Sri Lanka.
Well over seven hundred guests, largely from expatriate Sri Lankan communities in Melbourne gathered in their numbers to celebrate the event, graced by the presence of members of the clergy, parliamentarians of the Victorian Government, local government representatives, members of consular corps and community leaders.
Proceedings commenced with the National Anthem of Sri Lanka, followed by observance of two minute silence in memory of those who sacrificed their lives for the Glory of our Nation, introductory welcomes and lighting of the traditional oil lamp accompanied by chanting of Jaya Mangala Gatha.
Elegantly dressed in Lama-Sari, young Siyoda Jayawardena walked in, smiled and took control of the lectern as the compere. Welcoming the guests, she recalled the evolution of our Independence from 1948 as a self-governing Dominion, to a fully independent sovereign Nation in 1972, with the passage of new constitution which created the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka with our own Head of State. This, she stressed, was the spirit of Independence in which we gathered that evening to join the National Day celebrations of our Mathru Bhumi - Janma Bhumi Lanka. A stunning history lesson! Guests were ecstatic!
Multi-faith blessings were led by Venerable Na-Otunne Vijitha Sangha Naayaka Thera-Paada by reciting Seth-Pirith. Rev. Premakantha Kurakkal administered Hindu blessings. Rev. Dr. Ruwan Palapathwala conducted Christian prayers and Mr. Omar Haniffa, Islamic prayers.
Now it was the time for Consul General WGS Prasanna to deliver his official welcome and to read the Message from the President of Sri Lanka His Excellency Maithripala Sirisena, in Sinhala. The Message in Tamil was read by Thayanandan Sujanthan, and in English, by Ryle Moldrich.
Then the speeches by Hon. Jude Perera MP representing the Premier of Victoria Hon. Daniel Anddrews MP and by Hon. Robert Clark MP representing the Leader of the Opposition Hon. Mathew Guy MP.
These formalities over, it was the time for the cultural presentation. A cavalcade of dance, music, song and pulsating drums, exploring the mystique and majesty of three Sri Lankan dance traditions: Kandyan, Ruhunu and Sabaragamuwa, blended with Bharatha Natyam, the South Indian classical dance repertoire in its pristine pure form with vigour, grace and rhythmic beauty. The cultural presentation was ushered in by Sri Lankan Cultural Ensemble of Australia and Janali Dance Academy through their presentation of ‘ Asaddrusha Vannama’, a dance routine drawn from the Kandyan tradition extolling the virtues of the Buddha. This was followed by’ Natarajah Anjali’, a cosmic dance in praise of Lord Shiva drawn from Bharatha Natyam repertoire, and presented by Nrithakshethra School of Classical Dance . ‘Dig Gei’ was presented by Rangana Udumbara Dance Troupe. Sabaragamuwa tradition. It was about young maidens invoking the blessings of God Saman, the guardian deity of the sacred precincts of Sri Pada.
’Sri Lanka – The Pearl of the Indian Ocean’ was from Ama Dance Academy. It was a graceful dance narrative in praise of Mother Lanka, a blend of Kandyan and Bharatha Natyam. Vishver Rangayathanaya presented ‘Naga Kanya’, an enchanting sinuous dance routine of Snake Maidens identified in Sri Lankan folk-lore as water-spirits, drawn from Ruhunu dance repertoire. Finally, it was the time for Abhina Dance Academy ‘ Gara Yakuma’ - a ritual dance derived from Ruhunu dance tradition dedicated to the notions of appeasement, atonement and divine blessings.
The Consular Award presentation for the students of expatriate Sri Lankan parents in recognition of their academic achievements at the Victorian Certificate of Education 2016 was organised and presented by Himalee and Vijaya Wickrama Kaunasena. Of the 23 high achievers, 12 were presented with celebratory mementoes and certificates of excellence and the rest with certificates of excellence.
On behalf of the Melbourne consulate, Consul Nilusha Dilmini was there to propose a formal vote of thanks.
Sirimavo Ediriweera, once again fulfilled a difficult and eminently commendable role in co-ordinating and presenting a yet another day of national celebrations, for the ninth time in succession, concluding to a military precision in two hours and five minutes, with a touch of class, allure and resounding patriotic fervour.
A ton of plaudits to twelve year aged young Siyoda for your splendid performance as a consummate presenter. You held a massive audience spellbound from beginning to end with your charm and exuberance. Super cute, you have the style and the divine gift of oratory Siyoda!
