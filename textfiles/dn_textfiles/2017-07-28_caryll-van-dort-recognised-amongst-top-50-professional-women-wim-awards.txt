Caryll Van Dort recognised amongst Top 50  professional Women at WIM awards

Caryll Van Dort, Group Director of MSL Group Sri Lanka was recently recognised for her contribution to the advertising industry at the Professional Career Women Awards organised by Women in Management.
Caryll received the Silver award in the Advertising category as an acknowledgement for her leadership in this field.
The Professional and Career Women Awards, launched in 2011, seeks to recognize and honour women who have contributed to economic growth in Sri Lanka and globally, by seizing opportunities and overcoming challenges.
This award places Caryll amongst a select group of women achievers in Sri Lanka who have broken through the glass ceilings imposed by cultural norms and social systems, to become inspirational role-models for the next generation of aspiring young women.
“I am immensely proud of Caryll and her success. This award recognizes the leadership she has demonstrated and the results she has achieved in leading MSL Group Sri Lanka to succeed in Sri Lanka within a brief period. It is hard earned and very well deserved.” said Ranil de Silva Managing Director, Leo Burnett Sri Lanka.
“In a career spanning almost two decades, Caryll has demonstrated her competency as a pioneering leader in the Public relations industry. The business result she has achieved, the work she has fulfilled and the accomplishments she has secured for her clients is what has brought her this success.”
“This Professional and Career Women Award is a true honour,” said Caryll Van Dort. “I am happy to receive this award, but am also humbled by this recognition, I would like to recognise the many different people - both men and women - who have invested in me, helped me to grow and challenged me every step of the way. To everyone one of them I'd like to say a heartfelt thank you.”
In 2016, Caryll was named as one of Campaign Asia's ‘Top 40 Women to Watch’, a list which celebrates women in the Asia-Pacific region who are disrupting the marketing communications industry and achieving success against all odds.
