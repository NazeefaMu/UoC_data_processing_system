Whopper fish tales of the ones that got away

Wherever anglers gather, we hear the stories all the time of the one that got away. And of how incredibly big the fish was. Do anglers lie? Most people seem to think so. Certainly, it is true that there are some fishermen and women who lie about the size of the fish that got away. But for the most part, anglers just exaggerate a little, or a lot, in the excitement of the moment.
I know this from my own experience. I do not profess to be in the same expert angling class as my cousins Arlen, Bambi or Vilma who are all reel aces and can tackle any denizen of the deep. They are all in the big game fishing league and are hailed as first-class anglers by any standards. To me, any kind of fishing is an exciting sport. When you become hooked on it, even a bad day of fishing is still better than a good day at the office! To many, fishing is not a sport - it’s a way of life.
But every so often, whenever a fish I had hooked breaks the surface of the water, I can swear blind that it’s the biggest fish I had ever seen. Then later, when I land it, I realize that it was nothing, but a feisty fighting little fingerling. Now imagine this! If that same fish had made a break for it I would be telling a real whopper about ‘the monster that high-tailed it, leaving me high and dry.’ That is because the fastest growing fish on earth is the one that got away. It is natural for your imagination to enhance what could have been and then it’s easy to pass that information on to others.
People are known to embellish the size or quantity of their catch when looking back. So don’t blame the anglers because they simply can’t help it. Actually, the size of the fish hardly matters once you hook it. Whether it is a monstrous barracuda or a fighting little Paraw on your line there will always be the guaranteed adrenaline rush. Your heart is still beating hard and the euphoria hits a frenzied high from hooking and retrieving the fish. In the excitement of the moment, some anglers’ eyes magnify the fish from 100 percent to 200 percent.
It simply happens sometimes and you don’t realize it. I was once being honest about the numbers and size of the catch telling my audience that the Kattawa shoal measured about 12 inches each. There was giggling all round when one of the women listening queried: “If they were 12 inches long why are your hands two feet apart?” So you see I don’t exaggerate...I just remember big!
A long time ago there was a raging debate at The Fishtails, which used to be my regular watering-hole. The Fishtails was actually a swimming club built on a natural rock foundation in a secluded cove beside the seaside. A good many of the former ‘Devils’ of Saint Bens used to patronize the breezy place.
It was a splendid, scenic venue for anyone wanting to relax and wet their whistle with a cheerful tipple. The debate was triggered by a former classmate Desi who was baiting another old batch-mate nicknamed ‘Jambu’. There had never been any love lost between Desi and Jambu since they had been in rompers in Baby Class together. The fact that Desi was a lousy fisherman and Jambu a keen and successful angler hardly helped bridge the rift.
Jambu had walked into the clubhouse with a string of fresh fish he had caught at the adjacent Fisheries Harbour. He handed them over to the clubhouse kitchen with instructions to batter-fry half the catch as a treat for the gang and keep the rest for themselves. Just as he retreated to the shower stalls to wash up Desi dashed into the club foyer and began scribbling on the white board with a black marker pen. He adeptly inscribed this legend on the board in enormous letters: ‘A fisherman is a jerk on one end of the line waiting for a jerk on the other end’.
Jambu glanced at the board, ignored the taunt and joined the gang.
As he ordered a round of drinks another old Ben, Boyd, playing ‘Devil’s Advocate’ informed him that the discussion underway centered around the reputation of fishermen as being notorious liars. Looking decidedly uncomfortable Jambu eased back in his chair and looked around for a sympathetic face among the baiting crew. There wasn’t a single one in sight. Boyd continued: “Desi here has posed the question of whether all fishermen are liars or do all liars fish?”
The biggest wag of them all Sir Chepps interjected: “It’s not that all fishermen are liars or that only liars fish. The problem lies with the uncanny ability of the fish to keep growing after it is caught!” But Desi seemed remorseless with his baiting of his poor angling contemporary: “No, I tell you, fishermen are actually incapable of telling the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help them cod. I repeat, so help them cod. It’s in their genes. And I don’t mean their fishy smelling denims either, although that could be the case as well in the present circumstances.” He then moved his chair away from Jambu and fired a below-the-belt shot: “Old Fisherman never die, they just smell that way!”
Desi waved to an acquaintance at the bar and yelled: “Tall fish tales, being told at Fishtails!” Just then the waiter arrived with sizzling hot platters of Jambu’s fried fish. Jambu seeming to have regained his composure shot back: “If wishes were fishes, we’d have fish fry.” Sir Chepps while spearing a fork into the tempting dish said: “Thank you Jambu…Good things come to those who bait!”
Jambu stood up and disappeared into the staff quarters of the club. He emerged soon enough holding two fishing rods, his own and Desi’s, and a two pound fish from his catch. He threw the slimy creature at Desi who tried to hold on to it as it fell into his lap. He shot back at Desi: “The only way you will ever catch a fish is if someone throws it at you. So there!”
He then flaunted his professional fiberglass rod publicly announcing it was his, and then placed Desi’s much shorter one alongside it.
Jambu then yelled for another round of drinks as he delivered his devastating coup de grace: “You can separate the men from the boys by comparing the size of their rods!”
