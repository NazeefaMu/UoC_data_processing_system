Roads in Batticaloa get facelift

Dilapidated roads under the Batticaloa Municipal Council are renovated now despite the political instability in the country.
The Batticaloa Mayor has accelerated many a road development work in the town and its suburbs at present and many of them will be complete before the year end.
The Periya Uranini 1st Lane is under renovation now. Batticaloa Mayor Thiagaraja, former MP Srination, and MC councilor Pupalraja inspected the renovation work recently.
