Glow in partnership with ‘Purple Fashionista’

Pioneering skin care nutrient brand Glow, recently joined hands with two Sri Lankan fashion icons, at the ‘Purple Fashionista’ in aid of a family who lost everything to the recent floods brought on by the SouthWest Monsoon.
“Being one of Sri Lanka’s skin care nutrient brand that has consistently championed the concept of ‘inner beauty’, Glow felt it is our responsibility to come forward at a time when flood-affectedfamilies remain helpless.
Glow is privileged to be part of ‘Purple Fashionista’ and hope initiatives like this will help bring out the inner beauty of all Sri Lankans,” said Country Manager for Mega Lifesciences Praveen Viswakumaran.
‘Purple Fashionista’ conceptualized by Miss Sri Lanka for Miss Universe 2005, Rozanne Diasz and her friends Rashmi Lankika and Sonali Bertinus was held in late October at the Kingsbury Hotel attracting a crowd of over 300, who enjoyed an eclectic fashion show with designer Michael Wijesuriya. Former Mrs. Sri Lanka Rosy Senanayake graced the occasion as chief guest.
All contributions will go towards building a home for Priyantha and his family residing in Unalla, Matara.
“Our ethos has been built around inner beauty and the wellness of our people before profit and that has enabled us connect with a wide cross section of people across Sri Lanka.
Glow has been in the forefront of many CSR initiatives and will continue to play an active role in promoting the concept of inner beauty across the island,”said Brand Manager for Glow, Shrmila.
