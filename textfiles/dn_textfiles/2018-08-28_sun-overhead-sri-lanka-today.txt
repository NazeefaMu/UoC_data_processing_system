Sun overhead Sri Lanka today

On the apparent southward relative motion of the sun, it is going to be directly over the latitudes of Sri Lanka today (28) and on September 7, the Meteorology Department said.
The sun will be overhead Kalapoomy, Kandavil and Navantkadu towns at about 12.11 pm today.
Meanwhile, the Meteorology Department also said showers or thundershowers will occur at several places in the Uva, Eastern, North Central and Northern Provinces, after 2 pm.
Light showers may occur at a few places in the Central, Sabaragamuwa and Western Provinces. Fairly strong gusty winds (up to 40-50 kmph) can be expected in the Hambantota District.
There may be temporary localised strong winds during thundershowers.
