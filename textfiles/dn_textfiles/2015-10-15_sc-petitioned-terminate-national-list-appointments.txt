SC petitioned to terminate National List appointments

A petition was filed today in the Supreme Court calling for the termination of appointments made through the National List of the United People's Freedom Alliance during the recent general election.
The petition which was filed by Attorney-at-Law Nagananda Koddithuwakku, pointed out that 14th Amendment to the Constitution had not been passed at a general election, hence was not valid.
Therefore he appealed to the Supreme Court to make the decision illegal which had appointed defeated candidates as MPs.
