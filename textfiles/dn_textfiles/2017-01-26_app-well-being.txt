App for well-being

AIA Vitality - a science-based wellness programme - was introduced to the AIA staff and agents to provide them with knowledge, tools and motivation to improve health.
The programme was launched in a fun-filled day of orientation and activity including an introduction to the AIA Vitality programme as well as a morning walk, an energetic Zumba session and a team race across an obstacle course, which had the employees build up quite a sweat!
The AIA Vitality app can be downloaded free from the Google play-store or the Apple app-store.
