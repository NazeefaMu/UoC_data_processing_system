No more power cuts, CEB promises

 
The disruption of power will halt tomorrow (28), CEB Spokesperson Sulakshana Jayawardena said.
He said that supply of power was disrupted intermittently islandwide to balance the national grid.
Jayawardena said the third unit of the Norochcholai Power Plant, which has a capacity of 300MW, is no longer functioning, which has contributed to the need for the disruption of the supply of power.
He also said that capacity of the Kelanitissa Power Plant had been reduced by 110 MW while the Pallekele and Galle hydro power plants did not have sufficient oil to run them.
