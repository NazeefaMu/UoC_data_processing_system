Hema Nalin built a niche identity in announcing: PM

The name, Hema Nalin, brings in to mind vivid memories of a pleasing smile, appealing speech and wonderful presentation. He was a veteran media personality who built a niche identity synonymous with him in the announcing art, opening a new path beyond the vocational field, stated Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in a condolence message issued on the death of media personality Hema Nalin Karunaratne.
The message said “Hema Nalin who learnt his letters from Royal College, Colombo, stepped into the media sector in 1983. Joining Rupavahini as an assistant programme producer, he worked with dedication to gain vocational experience and honed his skills by studying journalism in Malaysia, USA, England and Germany to build up his own identity.”
The Prime Minister said, “Hema Nalin, who worked up the ladder at Rupavahini to become a programme director, earned popularity as a veteran announcer. The programme ‘Namayayi Paha’ he presented through Rupavahini will never be erased from the memory of listeners.
“Hema Nalin who also worked at Swarnavahini for some time, later worked as an independent media personality and opened his own Heritage Media Academy to train television announcers of both sexes.
“Later, he started the Heritage Television channel to take Sri Lanka’s pride to the international world and was its Director until his demise.
“Hema Nalin who won awards for his programmes such as ‘Namayayi Paha’, ‘Ananda Rathriya’ and ‘Saki Sanda’ was fortunate enough to earn permanent honour and acclaim from his friends and clients,” the Premier stated.
Conveying his deepest sympathies to Hema Nalin Karunaratne’s bereaved family members, relatives and friends, the Prime Minister wished him the eternal bliss of Nibbana.
