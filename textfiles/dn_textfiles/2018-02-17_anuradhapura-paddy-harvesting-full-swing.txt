Anuradhapura paddy harvesting in full swing

The 2017/18 Maha season paddy harvesting is in progress in Anuradhapura, Vavuniya, Kilinochchi, Mullativu and Jaffna districts in the Anuradhapura district as private paddy traders are busily engaged in purchasing paddy since no Paddy Market Board purchasing centres are open.
Anuradhapura PMB District Manager Nimal Tennakoon said they were equipped with storing capacity for 68,000 mT paddy. Purchasing was at its lowest during the last three cultivation seasons.
"During the Maha seasonal harvesting period, we aim to buy around 15,000 mT paddy and we will discourage private sector dealers who attempt to buy paddy at a lower price than the guaranteed price Rs. 41.00 for Samba and Rs. 38.00 for Nadu varieties," he said.
Kilinochchi PMB District manager Shantha Kumara SAID Kilinochchi, Mullativu and Vavuniya farmers have commenced harvesting and majority of them are drying paddy stocks hoping to sell them to the PMB at the guaranteed price. Kilinochchi, Vavuniya, Mullathivu and Jaffna farmers have cultivate 75,000 hectares aiming at a yielding of 186,300 mT during the 2017/18 Maha season.
Anuradhapura Government Agent R.M. Wanninayake said that only 71,000 ha cultivated with paddy instead of 130,200 hectares as planned were receiving Monsoon rain during the 2017/2018 Maha cultivation.
According to the fertiliser secretariat information, 87,920 farmers were paid fertiliser subsidy amounted to Rs. 964.8 million on the basis of Rs. 25,000 per two hectares the maximum.
Wanninayake said that although the farmers who have faced three consecutive cultivation seasons have sown paddy taking a risk amidst the poor monsoon rainfall under minor and medium irrigation systems in 42,670 ha, there was a threat of crop damages if some rain have not received within the next few weeks.
According to the Government Agent, 60,993 farmers took to paddy cultivation in Anuradhapura and cultivated 50,666 ha in the 2016/2017 Maha season.
The fertilizer subsidy paid was Rs. 633.11 million. In 2017 Yala season, 35,344 farmers have cultivated 24,631 ha with paddy and the fertiliser subsidy paid was Rs. 312 million.
