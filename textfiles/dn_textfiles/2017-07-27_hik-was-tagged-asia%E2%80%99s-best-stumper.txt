H.I.K. was  tagged Asia’s Best Stumper

In my last two columns I covered with pleasure ‘SPORTS LEGENDS’, ‘BIG BEN’ NAVARATNE and MAHESH RODRIGO. Both wicket keepers were of international class and I also reproduced the compliments paid to them by the greatest batsman that the world had seen ,and will ever see, Australian Sir Donald Bradman and famous Australian cricketer and reputed cricket journalist Jack Fingleton.
And today we pay tribute to another great wicket keeper of the pre Test cricket era Herbert I.K.Fernando of St.Peter’s College, Bambalapitiya which has produced many outstanding cricketers. Besides HIK there was that shining star the let handed CLIVE INMAN who still holds the record of scoring a double hundred in the Peterite-Josephian ‘Big Match’.
FERNANDO was born in Jaffna as his father was a police officer attached to the Jaffna police. FERNANDO who shone in his studies also showed a keen interest and love as a budding cricketer. Surprisingly when FERNANDO came to Colombo his first school as a junior, believe it or not ,was to a girls school, Holy Family Convent, Bambalapitiya.
It was no surprise then that he joined the school at the opposite side St.Peter’s College, where his love for studies and cricket began to blossom and bloom. FERNANDO served notice of his natural talent as a wicket keeper/batsman at a very early age and had the fortune of coming under the expert coaching and guidance of Shelton Wirasinghe, Russel Heyn and the one and only Herbert Wittachchy
Right style of batting
Today coaches of this caliber are hard to find. They taught FERNANDO the right style of batting. Play straight and don’t indulge and play the cross bat shot unless the ball is pitched way outside the leg stump. Firstly get your eye in before launching. FERNANDO a stylish right hand batsman was blessed with an array of strokes and when he took on the bowlers however good they were, he would pierced the field and runs flowed freely. He was a treat to watch and many schoolboy bowlers feared him. Many were the big scores he made which are too numerous to mention.
In addition to his classic batting, it was his wicket keeping that shone like a beacon. Blessed with a good eye and quick reflexes he would stand up to the wicket be it to pacemen or spinners. His gloves seemed to have glue in them as he took incredible catches standing up or diving either side.
My first glimpse of him was as a 10 year old when I watched in amazement the big 100 he made against my old school St. Benedict’s College, Kotahena in if my memory serves me right in 1950 or 1951. Being a cricket fanatic that knock made me dream of being a batsman of his caliber. He captained the school by the canal with great success and distinction.
After a highly successful school career he joined the Nondescripts Cricket Club where his fame and fortune grew making big runs and keeping brilliantly. And it did not take the selectors of that era to plonk him in to the national team. Fernando won his national colours in 1953 when he gloved against Lindsay Hassett’s Australians at the Colombo Oval and enjoyed and still remembers his first victim when he stumped another of his kind the famous Don Tallon.
Vicious off spin by Abu Fuard
Fernando captained the Board President’s X1 against Joe
Lister’ X1 and restricted that strong batting line up to 164 thanks to some vicious off spinning by Abu Fuard who captured six wickets.
Fernando after captaining the NCC later joined medical college and passed out as a doctor. In 1961 he said adieu to the Maitland Place Club and threw in his lot with the Sri Lanka Army and continued his cricketing career with great success.
During his reign he earned kudos when he was tagged the best wicket keeper in Asia, beating some top keepers that India and Pakistan had which was a great honour to the country. After his retirement from the game he served as selector, coached his Alma Mater and was also a radio cricket commentator.
FERNANDO in 1963 was commissioned to the regular Army and held the rank of Brigadier in 1986 as Director of Welfare and Rehabilitation. He was instrumental in establishing the Ranaviru Sevana at Ragama. FERNANDO obtained his Diploma in Anesthetics of Royal College of Surgeons in England. He retired from the Army in 1995. He is one of the nicest guys you could meet.
FERNANO was a pride to Sri Lanka cricket
