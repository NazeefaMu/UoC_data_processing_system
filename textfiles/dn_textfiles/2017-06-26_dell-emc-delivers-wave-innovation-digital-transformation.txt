Dell EMC delivers wave of innovation for digital transformation

Dell EMC announced a wave of new innovations, serving a specific and meaningful role towards helping enterprises realise their goals for digital transformation.
The announcement was made at a press conference in Colombo where Chue Chee Wei, Vice President, Asia Emerging Markets Region, Dell EMC and Roshan Nugawela, Country Manager Sri Lanka and Maldives, Dell EMC, briefed media about Digital and IT transformation for local businesses.
While there is a clear imperative for companies to transform their legacy IT, digital transformation is becoming the driving force to making IT transformation a top priority.
The ESG 2017 IT Transformation Maturity Curve study commissioned by Dell EMC shows 95% of survey respondents indicate their organizations are at risk of falling behind a smaller group of industry peers that are transforming their IT infrastructures, processes and delivery methods to accelerate their goals of becoming digital businesses.
The same study also revealed that a majority of enterprises globally need to fully embrace the aspects of IT transformation to remain competitive in the increasingly digital world.
To satisfy these diverse demands Dell EMC provides a comprehensive, best-of-breed portfolio to meet the unique needs of enterprises in almost every industry. Among the major new products unveiled, Dell EMC announced a preview of the new 14th Generation Power Edge servers designed to usher new levels of performance and scalability for customers.
“We live in the world of globalization where information and technology are the base of growth and development. At Dell EMC, we believe in breaking the stereotypical barriers and providing convenience to our customers through continuous innovations. We are determined to provide products, services and solutions to help local businesses accelerate their IT and Digital Transformation journeys,” said Chue Chee Wei.
“As part of the world’s largest privately controlled technology company, Dell EMC is well positioned to serve our valued customers in Sri Lanka by effectively positioning our broad solutions portfolio to help customers be more competitive in their respective business segments. We look forward to our continued role as a trusted advisor to the country’s IT industry,” said Roshan Nugawela.
