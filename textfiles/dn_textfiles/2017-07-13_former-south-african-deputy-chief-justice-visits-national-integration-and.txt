Former South African Deputy Chief Justice visits National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry

Former South African Deputy Chief Justice Dikgang Moseneke, Commonwealth Secretariat Head of Human Rights Advocate Karen McKenzie and South African Political Counsellor Johannes Van Niekerk, visited the Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation recently.
According to Justice Dikgang Moseneke, “in our system, everybody has the right to be Buddhist, Muslim, Hindu, or even without religion.” The constitution specially protects these rights. Justice also emphasized on “unity in diversity, mutual respect and co-existence” as important element for reconciliation. Most of the violence in South Africa is due to poverty, exclusion and disintegration of families.
Justice Dikgang Moseneke also spoke about reaching the consensus on constitution on South African experiences. However, though there were challenges, common value of unity in diversity, reconciliation, democracy, fundamental rights and freedom helped to overcome the challenges. The Constitution of South Africa recognized rights not based on religion or ethnicity, but gave protection to minorities based on equity, dignity, without discrimination.
The Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa examined as to how people disappeared or were killed and how to address such pains. Reparation for victims is one of the pillars in transitional justice that helped victims to receive compensation.
The transitional justice is different from the normal justice and it was aimed at buying peace. Amnesty was given to ex-combatants and they were socially integrated. Women's participation in all areas of transitional justice and constitutional reforms was given importance. In South Africa, 35-40% of the women are in the Parliament, said Justice Dikgang Moseneke.
Non-recurrence and memorialization were also important in the reconciliation process. Local peace committees in South Africa helped to keep violence and tension down and solve burning issues.
The Justice further said that transforming the conflict into peaceful and sustainable outcome requires comprehensive understanding of the root causes of conflict. Conflict mediation and conflict resolution in hot spot districts are also important.
Healing and reparation are one of the most important element for reconciliation.
The Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation presented the Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) of the Ministry. The interventions and initiatives were commended by the Former Justice Dikgang Moseneke and Commonwealth Secretariat Head of Human Rights Advocate Karen McKenzie.
The meeting was attended by Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation Secretary V. Sivagnanasothy, State Secretary M.M. Zuhair, the Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation Additional Secretary, representatives from Ministry of National Co-Existence Dialogue and Official Languages and the Secretariat for Coordinating Reconciliation Mechanisms (SCRM).
