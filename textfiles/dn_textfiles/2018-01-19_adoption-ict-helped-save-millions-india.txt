Adoption of ICT helped to save millions in India

The annual Lakshman Kadirgamar Memorial Lecture was held at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute of International Relations and Strategic Studies (LKI), hosted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sri Lanka, on 15 January 2018. The lecture was delivered by Ravi Shankar Prasad, Minister for Law & Justice and Electronics & IT, India, on the theme ‘The Evolution of India’s Constitutional and Democratic Polity.’
In his remarks, Tilak Marapana Minister of Justice remembered the late Minister as “a true gentleman who enjoyed the respect and admiration of his counterparts and leaders of foreign countries, and all those who had the privilege of meeting him.”
Minister Shankar Prasad remarked that he was honoured to have been invited to deliver the prestigious Lakshman Kadirgamar Memorial Lecture which is held annually in memory of “one of the most outstanding intellectual, jurist and influential diplomats of his time.”
In his lecture, he noted that India’s Constitution is a great embodiment of the charter of democracy. In his lecture, Minister Prasad also praised the role of the Election Commission of India in the consolidation of Indian democracy by highlighting its work in preventing violence and electoral malpractices.
As the Minister for Electronics & IT, Minister Prasad also spoke of India’s emergence as a global IT powerhouse, stating, “We opened 300 million bank accounts for those who did not have bank accounts; linked it with Aadhaar, seeded them mobile phones and started delivering their welfare entitlements directly into the bank accounts. In the process we have saved around USD 9 billion.” He also cited the success of India’s digital literacy programs, the initiative of developing ITeS and BPO centres in smaller towns in India, and digital services like eHospital, eScholarship, digital market for farmers and the soil health card.
Mrs. Suganthie Kadirgamar, wife of the late Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar, also spoke.
The high-profile event drew a diverse group of attendees, including representatives from other missions, scholars from universities and think tanks, media, representatives from the private sector and civil society, and students.
