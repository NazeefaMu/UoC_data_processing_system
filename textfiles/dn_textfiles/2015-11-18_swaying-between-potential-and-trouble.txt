Swaying between potential and trouble

Former President J.R. Jayewardene’s Cabinet, in 1977, had three leadership aspirants.
They were Ranasinghe Premadasa, Lalith Athulathmudali and Gamini Dissanayake who held key ministerial portfolios in President Jayewardene’s Cabinet.
It was crystal clear from the very outset that the three ministers were vying for all-powerful Executive Presidency after Jayewardene’s second term. Jayewardene, an astute politician to the core, used this intra-party rivalry for the benefit of the government which introduced a string of drastic economic and political reforms within a period of 12 years.
Jayewardene placed vital projects of his government under Premadasa, Dissanayake and Athulathmudali, allowing the three ministers to project themselves as potential Heads of State, after his retirement.
Athulathmudali, a newcomer to the Parliament, was given a Cabinet Ministerial portfolio and his flagship project was the ‘Mahapola fund’ which strengthened the country’s higher education sector for more than three decades. Hundreds of thousands of university students from rural areas were greatly benefitted by the ‘Mahapola fund’ over the past 30 years as a result of Athulathmudali’s farsighted strategy.
He also held an important position under the Jayewardene Cabinet as the Minister of Defence. It was the initial stage of the Tamil militant movement and Athulathmudali was entrusted with the task of crushing it militarily. Although Athulathmudali’s efforts were hampered by a surfeit of ‘external issues’ beyond his control, he achieved remarkable success with the ‘Vadamarachchi operation’, in 1987, which confined the LTTE militants to a tiny strip of land. Although the operation had to be abandoned after India’s intervention, Minister Athulathmudali, alongside senior military officials like General Denzil Kobbekaduwa and Wijeya Wimalaratne, gained immense popularity as a ‘capable leader’ who could lead the country one day!

Jayewardene appointed Gamini Dissanayake, who secured his Nuwaraeliya seat comfortably at the General election in 1977, as the Minister of Mahaweli Development. the Mahaweli development project, a flagship project of the Jayewardena government, was placed under Dissanayake as he was a trusted lieutenant of the former President.
The Mahaweli development project, which was expected to take 30 years, was completed within six years as a result of Dissanayake’s hands-on leadership. The project, which covered a large area of land, focused on irrigation, hydropower generation, agriculture, town and country development while triggering a ‘quantum leap’ in terms of economic development.
In addition to his role at the Ministry of Mahaweli Development, he was also the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Cricket Board in the early 1980s and helped the country to gain the Test Status in cricket.
On the other hand, he played a pivotal role in signing the Indo-Lanka Peace Accord in 1987 under tumultuous circumstances and ensured the setting up of Provincial Councils as a solution to the North and East problem.
Ranasinghe Premadasa, after he was appointed as the Prime Minister of the J.R. Jayewardene administration, undertook the task of ‘sheltering the poor’. The programmes he initiated under the Jayewardene administration included Jana Saviya, the instrument he used to help the poor, a foster parents scheme, the Gam Udawa project with which he tried to stir up the stupor in the villages, the mobile secretariat whereby he took the central government bureaucracy to the peasants, the Tower Hall Foundation for drama and music, and the pension schemes he initiated for the elder artistes.
In the hindsight, many political analysts believe that the country- at large benefitted from the three Prime Ministerial aspirants in the Jayewardene Cabinet.
‘Leadership aspirants’ in present Cabinet
It is in the grapevine among political circles that there are three Prime Ministerial (and Presidential) aspirants in the present Cabinet too. According to rumours emanating from the corridors of power, they are Ministers Rajitha Senaratne, Patali Champika Ranawaka and Nimal Siripala de Silva. Both Senaratne and Ranawaka, although they contested the Parliamentary election on the UNP ticket, are considered close allies of President Sirisena. It is observed by many that the three politicians are positioning themselves as ‘future leaders’ of the country’s national politics. Since politics is a game revolving around power, no one can find fault with them for being Prime Ministerial or Presidential aspirants.
However, there is one striking difference between the Prime Ministerial aspirants of the Jayewardene Cabinet and those of the current government. Although Premadasa, Athulathmudali and Dissanayake projected themselves as ‘future leaders’ of the country by undertaking giant projects, the Prime Ministerial and Presidential aspirants of the present government are attempting to reach their personal goals by triggering ‘media shows’ and controversies. It also indicates that the ‘leadership aspirants’ of the present Cabinet are not hesitant to pursue their objectives at the expense of the image and the reputation of the entire government.
It is against this backdrop that one has to analyze their involvement in the controversy surrounding Avant Garde private security firm. Senaratne and Ranawaka pushed hard for the removal of Law and Order Minister Thilak Marapana and called for stern action against the company.
During the Cabinet meeting two weeks ago, Senaratne and Ranawaka said the government’s position on the security firm was not in line with the tenets of good governance. Responding to their remarks, Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said the government’s position on the matter was based on the Attorney General’s observations with regard to the security firm. He said there were no grounds to take legal action against the company over the floating armoury near the Galle harbour.
This resulted in a verbal battle between Senaratne and Rajapakshe who tried hard to defend their positions in the eyes of the media.
Rajapakshe openly challenged the media statement made by Senaratne on Thursday, after a meeting on the Avant Garde issue chaired by the President. While responding to Rajapakshe’s claims, Senaratne called the latter a “Goda Perakadoruwa” indicating the Justice Minister was not ‘fit enough’ to be a lawyer.
Senaratne’s remark provoked Rakitha Rajapakshe, Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe’s son, who went on to claim that Senaratne was a ‘third class’ media spokesman. Posting a statement on his Facebook profile, Rakitha said: “The third class media spokesman of the Governmnet of Sri Lanka has officially made a split of the Government. If he calls my father a goda perakodoruwa he is a bloody … (edited out)… who was sacked from the parliament for selling expired medicine to Sri Lanka Army. That was the first and only time an MP was sacked from Parliament by Courts of Sri Lanka.”
There was another dimension to the battle between Rajapakshe and Senaratne. In the case where Senaratne was unseated from Parliament for doing business with the State while being an MP in April, 1999, Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe appeared for the petitioner Dilan Perera, a Deputy Minister of the then People’s Alliance Government. Former Minister K.N. Choksy, a veteran lawyer, appeared on behalf of Senaratne who was then an MP of the UNP.
The feud between Senaratne and Rajapakshe was widely reported in media and some even dubbed it as an internal power struggle within the national unity government. The two ministers and their close associates were fueling the controversy on a daily basis with fiery remarks, attacking the positions of each other.
Wijeyadasa and Senaratne ordered to ‘keep quiet’
When there were strong indications that the matter was blowing out of proportion, both the President and the Prime Minister instructed Senaratne and Rajapakshe to refrain from attacking each other over the Avant Garde controversy. The Prime Minister advised his party member Rajapakshe to ‘keep quiet’ and the President decided to speak to Senaratne over the matter. The President and the Prime Minister told the two ministers that their verbal battle was not helping the government in finding a solution to the problem.
The other Prime Ministerial aspirant of the government Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva gave rise to another controversy last week by openly criticizing the government during a public meeting he held in Badulla. The minister said not even a trace of ‘yahapalanaya’ exists in the present government. According to certain media reports, the minister had said that the people, who were deceived by Facebook, made a mistake on January 08.
The outcome of the Presidential election on January was President Maithripala’s Sirisena’s ascension to power. President Sirisena is the present leader of the SLFP of which de Silva too holds a very senior position. Had President Sirisena lost the Presidential election on January 08, former President Rajapaksa would have continued in office for six years. The Minister’s statement indicated that he preferred former President Rajapaksa to be the leader of the country for the next six years. Interestingly, he has made this remark while serving as a senior Cabinet minister of President Sirisena’s government and functioning as a senior office-bearer of the SLFP.
It is clear that de Silva, through his statement, tries to cater to the sentiments of the grassroots level supporters of the SLFP. The grassroots level supporters of the party voted for Rajapaksa at the Presidential and Parliamentary elections this year, although the party ended up on the losing side. There is no justifiable reason to believe that the grassroots level members of the party are greatly supportive of the SLFP Central Committee’s decision to enter into a national unity government with the UNP.
As the Local Government election is just a few months away, the party now has to go to the doorsteps of its grassroots level supporters again. The party also has to defend its decision to form a national unity government with the UNP, against the will of the grassroots level members of the party.
It is against this backdrop that de Silva has resorted to attack the national unity government of which he too is a minister. Other SLFP ministers in the government too will resort to the same strategy in the near future. Some of them may even resign from their ministerial portfolios just to gain the sympathy of the village level SLFP supporters.
However, the core issue is the SLFP’s indecisiveness on their position at the Local Government election. Soon after the Parliamentary election in August, there were signs that the SLFP was trying to distance itself from the UPFA coalition.
At this point, it is evident that the party is striving to form an alliance of some sort before facing the Local Government election. When contacted by the Daily News, SLFP General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake said the party was still holding discussions with several other parties to form an alliance to contest the Local Government election. However, the Minister refused to divulge the names of the political parties presently in talks with the SLFP.
At the same time, some minor constituent parties of the UPFA, including the National Freedom Front, the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya and the National Freedom Front, are currently holding discussions to contest the elections separately under a pro-Rajapaksa alliance.
SLFP’s confusion
On the other hand, President Maithripala Sirisena has already stated that he will lead the SLFP’s campaign at the Local Government election. Even if the SLFP manages to form an alliance before the Local Government election early next year, the alliance will be led by President Sirisena.
Interestingly, minor constituents of the UPFA are not willing to enter into the electoral fray under the President’s leadership. They push for former President Rajapaksa’s active involvement in the election campaign. They assert that grassroots level voters of the party still not ready to accept President Sirisena’s leadership and as a result the party will suffer a landslide defeat at the Local Government election. Leader of the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya and UPFA Parliamentarian Udaya Gammanpila, addressing a press conference in Colombo, said explicitly that they would not contest the election under the President’s leadership.
UPFA Parliamentarian and SLFP Pathadumbara Organizer Lohan Ratwatte too expressed similar sentiments, while speaking at a pocket meeting in his electorate a few days ago. The Parliamentarian said the party would not be able to win the Local Government election if President Sirisena led its campaign.
“SLFP grassroots level members oppose the leadership of President Sirisena as they believe he is responsible for the SLFP’s debacle,” Ratwatte, a cousin of former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga said, while inviting SLFP Parliamentarians holding positions in the Yahapalana government to defect from the ruling camp and work for the victory of the SLFP.
Meanwhile, some seniors of the party have already aligned themselves with the minor constituent parties of the UPFA without any approval from the party’s Central Committee. For instance, party seniors such as Kumara Welgama and Dullas Alahapperuma play key roles in the so-called ‘united opposition’ and even chair its meetings, while keeping the party in the dark about their initiatives. They also hold positions in the SLFP and take part in meetings of the party’s decision-making bodies.
It is in this context that the SLFP decided to convene its Central Committee meeting on Tuesday evening. The Central Committee has to make a quick decision on the party’s position on the Local Government election because the government has already decided to hold the election without further postponement. If all goes well, the Local Government election is likely to take place in March, 2016.
While preparing for the Local Government election, the government has also decided to proceed with comprehensive constitutional reforms. As promised during its election campaign early this year, the government is now exploring the possibility of introducing a new constitution, with a total abolition of Executive Presidency. President Sirisena gave the first message in this regard, when he addressed the funeral of Ven Maduluwawe Sobhitha Thera last week.
Jayampathy heads ‘consultative committee’ on constitutional reforms
A committee, headed by Parliamentarian Dr. Jayampathy Wickramaratne, has already been appointed to take measures with regard to constitutional amendments. Among its members are senior lawyer Suren Fernando and Additional Secretary (Legal) to the Prime Minister Bimba Thilakaratne.
Prof. Suri Ratnapala, a veteran in the field of legal studies, is likely to be the government’s chief consultant when formulating the new constitution.
Prof. Ratnapala, who was in Sri Lanka for a brief visit last month, held several rounds of discussions with the top rung leadership of the government on the matter.
During the discussion, Professor Ratnapala, who is currently based in Australia, has agreed to take up the task.
Ratnapala is presently a Professor of Public Law and Director of the Centre for Public, International and Comparative Law in the School of Law at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia.
Ratnapala served as a Senior State Counsel, representing the Sri Lankan state in landmark constitutional cases before he migrated to Australia where he completed masters and doctoral degrees before accepting tenure at the University of Queensland. He was appointed to the Chair of Public Law in 2001, in Australia.
Prof. Ratnapala, in 2014, gave expert opinion to the Bar Association of Sri Lanka on the applicability of the 18th Amendment with regard to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa seeking a third term. Although he said the former President Rajapaksa was disqualified for a third term in office, the then government proceeded with their election plans, without taking the expert’s view into consideration.
When contacted by the Daily News on Monday, Dr. Wickremaratne said the committee, headed by him, would only act as a body of experts to advise the government on constitutional matters.
“All political decisions have to be taken by the Parliament. Even the nature of the constitutional amendments should be determined by Parliament. We only act as a body of experts to guide them in the correct direction. We have nothing to do with political decisions,” Wickramaratne explained.
Meanwhile, a spokesman of the government who wished to remain anonymous said the government had decided to totally abolish the Executive Presidency and it would come into effect after the first term of President Maithripala Sirisena.
“The President and the Prime Minister have already stated that a new constitution will be presented to Parliament in 2016. It will be passed before September, 2017, as a new constitution requires the support of a two third majority in Parliament. So, the current national unity government will be entrusted with the task of passing the new constitution,” he explained.
He also added that the government would go for a referendum on the new constitution if the need arises.
“Although the government promised introduced a new constitution in its election manifesto, there are differences of opinion over the nature of the new constitution. Therefore, it would be essential to hold a referendum after passing the new constitution in Parliament,” the spokesman said.
