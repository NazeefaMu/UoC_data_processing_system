Asian Business Angel Forum to give  SL’s startup eco-system new boost

Colombo is gearing up to host some of Asia’s most prominent angel investors and venture capitalists with the Asian Business Angel Forum (ABAF) 2017 being held in conjunction with Venture Engine, Sri Lanka’s most successful platform for accelerating and expanding the country’s most promising entrepreneurial concepts.
ABAF is Asia's only investor conference that brings together angel investors, HNIs, venture capitalists and other key stakeholders to one platform that focuses on global startup trends and best practices amongst a host of topics, attracting over 250 leading investors from across the Asian, Asia Pacific, Middle East and Australasian regions.
The result of a bold partnership between founders BOV Capital, the Indian angel network and the Lankan angel network, Venture Engine has led the way in developing the startup eco-system in the country.
“From the outset, our vision for Venture Engine was to serve not only as a place to bring together Sri Lanka’s most ambitious and talented entrepreneurs, but also as an incubator capable of nurturing skills and honing business models to the level that these businesses can then work to aggressively compete on the global stage,” said Prajeeth Balasubramaiam of BOV Capital. "Selection as the host country for the Asian Business Angel Forum 2017 is a testament of how far the start-up ecosystem in the country has progressed over the last few years. This is a truly unprecedented opportunity for our local entrepreneurs to go beyond their familiar boundaries and take their business to the next level. I strongly urge anyone who feels that they have a strong business plan along with a novel business model to step forward and take up the challenge,” Lankan Angel Network Chairman, Dumith Fernando said.
Submissions for Venture Engine 2017 will be open up to August 9, following which the best business ideas will be selected for a programme of rapid improvement over the course of five workshops with filtering and mentoring between sessions. The ABAF programme will commence on October 12 at Cinnamon Lakeside which will include an opportunity for the Venture Engine finalists to present their ideas to ABAF participants.
The opening of the conference will be followed by an exhibition held in parallel featuring ten stalls, including five stalls reserved for Sri Lankan startups with the balance featuring exciting new startups from across the Asian region. The exhibition will be open to all visitors, and will provide a platform for startups looking to scale upwards in the region to raise their next round of funding.
