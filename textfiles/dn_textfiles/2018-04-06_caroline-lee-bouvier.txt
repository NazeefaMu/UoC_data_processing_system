Caroline Lee Bouvier

Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis had a younger sister, born into the tony Southampton, New York, family as Caroline Lee Bouvier. She lived largely in Jackie's shadow, though some considered her the 'prettier' and more vivacious of the two.
The year before John F. Kennedy announced his run for the US presidency, Lee married for the second time, to Polish Prince Stanislaw Albrecht Radziwill, on March 19, 1959. It was his third marriage. The pair had two children, both of whom were teenagers when their parents divorced in 1974 after 15 years of marriage.
It was Lee who introduced Jackie to Aristotle Onassis, in 1963. Rumors have flown over the years on how Jackie's marriage to Ari after the assassination of Kennedy infuriated Lee, who married and divorced a third time after the prince. Lee, 85, has tried her hand at a variety of things: acting, interior design, public relations.
The socialite has enjoyed the company of celebrities, once hanging out with The Rolling Stones and Truman Capote. She divides her time between New York and Paris, having lived in London with her prince.
