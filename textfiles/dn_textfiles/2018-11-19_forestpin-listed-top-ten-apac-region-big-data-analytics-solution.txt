Forestpin listed top ten APAC Region  Big Data Analytics Solution Providers

Each year, the APAC CIO Outlook Magazine publishes a list of top Big Data Analytics companies originating from the Asia Pacific Region. The 2018 list published in November includes the following companies given in alphabetical order, CADS (Malaysia), DATAVLT (Singapore), Forestpin (Sri Lanka), GRIDSUM (China), HYPERS (China), OneAD (Taiwan), (China), Tech Valley (China), Vpon (Taiwan), WINNER Technology (China).
The APAC CIO Outlook is a magazine published from the technology hub of Silicon Valley, USA, with sales offices in Hong Kong and editorial presence in all major APAC countries. The APAC CIO Outlook Magazine aims to provide a platform for CIOs, CTOs, and other senior level IT buyers and decision makers, along with CXOs of solution providers, to share their experiences, wisdom and advice with the enterprise IT community of APAC countries. They also identify and profile emerging companies providing cutting edge solutions to enterprises in APAC.
“We are delighted to be recognised in this prestigious list of Big Data Analytics software, which include very large companies from the region. I believe it’s due to the uniqueness of the value proposition of our solution,” said Forestpin Co-Founder and Director, Dilanke Hettiaratchi.
“We need to thank all of the progressive companies in Sri Lanka that were early adopters of Forestpin Analytics and Risk Alerts, and who have supported us along the way. Some of these companies already had the best of breed analytic solutions, yet saw the potential of timely visibility of risk, which has helped them towards mitigation of financial loss,” said Forestpin Co-Founder and Managing Director, Ransith Fernando.
Forestpin is a Sri Lankan company that helps companies reduce operational risk in transactions, by giving analytics and alerts on suspicious transactions.
Forestpin’s Risk Engine works as a part of the enterprise system in the background, where data is extracted on a predefined basis, and a series of anomaly detection computations are run, resulting in a risk score on each and every transaction. The engine also computes a dynamic threshold based on the alerts sent in the last 30 days, and the number of alerts a user can consume per day on average, where the transactions above the threshold are alerted either in digest form or individual alerts. The engine’s dynamic workflow with authorisation levels permits users to comment or change statuses based on their roles.
The updated statuses are used by the learning mechanism to identify the risk factor to the business. If an alert is marked as not useful, then the Risk Engine will stop highlighting that type of risk over time. If an alert is marked as keep alerting, human error, process improvement, or found manipulation, then the learning mechanism increases priority for the type of alerts. Interaction on the alerts is also captured for our enterprise customers on Forestpin analytics to ensure businesses are attending and investigating their alerts.
