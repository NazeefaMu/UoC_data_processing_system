Fundamental  problem of money  and banking…

Continued from yesterday
Fourth, customers do not have the assurance of their transaction records in electronic books and accounts in the event of a disaster as they do not have physical records to claim their interests. The IT is not a god-given machine to do everything and the correct status of so-called cyber security risk management is known by only few IT staff. The regular senior management oversight is not feasible on IT risk management in contrast to conventional banking processes. The senior management has to rely on what few IT staff and random audit
The modern monetary policies also can cause some noises to banks by changing interest rates and liquidity conditions in the inter-bank market, mostly overnight,as they cannot do much in present private/bank money-dominant systems. Inter-bank liquidity is mostly connected with daily cash flow management issues and strategies of some banks which has nothing to do with the wider liquidity position in the economy. As the responsiveness of the monetary policies on credit and consumer price index-based inflation driven by various external shocks is negligible in modern economies with high intermediation of private money, the overall demand for bank money would stay in the trend of business and economic environment without a major response to small adjustments of the monetary policies generally phased out for several years in terms of theoretical views for the long-run which never ends
staff report which are of highly technical jargon. Fifth, risk of stealing or misusing customer funds internally by some bank staff can become routine as internal pass-word controls can be manipulated and compromised for friendships. It is usual that banks rush to any innovation competitively and invariably end up in disaster. The prime cause of the last global financial crisis was the innovative structured products marketing and the next crisis could well be connected to the unmanaged electronic money and banking.
Less Business HR and Marketing and more Internal Controls
Application of business HR and marketing focusing on competition, innovation and profit needs to be cautious. In other businesses, shareholders are prepared to take both risks and returns and close down businesses in the event of catastrophe. In banking, depositors, i.e., nearly 90% of funding base, are not prepared to accept risks where the monetary system is not prepared to write-off bank-created money. HR management and marketing which are centered around profit-based performance targets have caused immense banking vulnerabilities. If financial engineers manufacture banking products and receive sugar high remuneration based on the present value of model-based future cash flows on such products, what pays out today is the hard cash earned/realized from already risky lending business.
There are ample instances that bank financial statements are manipulated while mis-selling, cross-selling and market manipulations are carried out to show the achievement of performance targets. A recent revelation of a global bank that a segment of staff led by some senior managers opened about 3.5 million fake bank and credit card accounts and 528,000 potentially improper online bill-pay enrollments during 2011-2015 period in the mask of better services to customers in order to charge fees on such accounts to meet marketing/sales targets is unbelievable. Nearly 5,300 staff connected to the incidence were immediately fired. The bank’s new Chairman recently responded that the number of such improperly opened accounts was still unknown. Overall, this irregularity has caused immense risk to the stability of the bank.
Instances of the grant of large bank loans to connected parties as reported from time to time are also connected to dark corners prevailing in potential breach of bank internal controls and banking practices which will end up in financial crimes at a cost to retail deposit base as the wholesale depositors are at a bargaining position. The immediate response of banks to news of such instances of improper businesses has always been that nothing wrong has happened. Regulatory fines charged from global banks on such unethical practices and mis-representation of financial condition are reported to be huge around US$ 300 bn. in 2009-2015. The two latest instances reported in the US are a fine of US$ 2 bn. on alleged misrepresentation of its loan quality and a fine of US$ 4.9, the largest ever charged from a single institution, on alleged mis-selling of mortgaged backed securities from two high street banks.
Banking is a more internal controls-based discipline/profession by respecting the integrity to protection of customer and bank funds. Whenever these is any loss to customer funds or bank funds, either internal controls may have been breached by some employees or existing internal controls may not have been adequate. No ambitious performers and aggressive marketeers should be permitted to breach internal controls and limits because they invariably end up in scandals as the conventional integrity is compromised for their ambitions. All reported bank rouge trades are connected to breach of internal controls for profit. Nick Leeson, Jeromy Kerviel, Kweku Adoboli and London Whale are historic names in such scandals whereas a large number of such names go unpublic. In general, both impressive profits and losses are indications of overall mis-management of funds in high risks. Therefore, the fitness and propriety of all levels of bank staff in terms of conventional descriptions should be the foundation of the HR and marketing in banks. Accountability mapping linked to the fitness and propriety for senior management to be responsible for respective business lines and operations is a new area of bank integrity management.
Promote Customer Relationship
Tracing customer conflicts and resolving them without losing the customers need to be practiced as part of good banking and not as part of good banking law. From the beginning, bank staff try to win against the customers’ grievances in most instances. The origin of the conflict may be a lapse of the bank itself in identifying the customer at the time of selling a product not suitable to the customer or imposing new charges without the knowledge of the customer. Therefore, the KYC/due diligence which is now confined to detect customers’ links to unlawful businesses should be extended to focus on mapping and improving the customers’ transactions worthiness gradually and targeted to attract the customers’ next generation also to the bank.
Research and development in customer base including market surveys of customer-needs and service satisfaction will help customer promotion because banks have to create customers and help them to become wealthier through basic financial intermediation and payment services. Customer guide books/hand-books covering products, costs, benefits and terms and conditions in place of ad-hoc marketing leaflets (that are scattered around the counters as seen in many pharmacies) will educate both public and bank staff on banking and promote relationships because all come to know their roles in banking transactions. If depositors also come to know that they cannot have banking services without running the systemic risk and their deposits are not risk-free, they may minimize their herd behavior of running on banks on bad information.
Everybody knows that banking cannot be advertised similar to fast foods or branded products because there is ethics not to steal money from or by banks. The products-marketing is to sell products somehow whereas products-awareness is to help consumers to buy products suitable to them. The latter is what banks should follow in relationship banking. However, if all banks compete for same customer groups in respective locations, especially few business groups, corporates and wealthy individuals, not only banks get trapped in deadly concentration risks, the markets and the economy which are the foundation for banks also will not expand. This is where banks have to find active business models to target wider customer segments such as community banking within the intermediation. In any case, banks getting into groups and conglomerates to engage in diverse businesses for synergies and diversification will end up in catastrophe for both banks and economies as they bring unknown business risks to already risky banking. No bank board or senior management is aware of how those conglomerates operate as even managing a small bank is a big action-research project.
No Panic on Monetary Policy Noises
The modern monetary policies also can cause some noises to banks by changing interest rates and liquidity conditions in the inter-bank market, mostly overnight,as they cannot do much in present private/bank money-dominant systems. Inter-bank liquidity is mostly connected with daily cash flow management issues and strategies of some banks which has nothing to do with the wider liquidity position in the economy. As the responsiveness of the monetary policies on credit and consumer price index-based inflation driven by various external shocks is negligible in modern economies with high intermediation of private money, the overall demand for bank money would stay in the trend of business and economic environment without a major response to small adjustments of the monetary policies generally phased out for several years in terms of theoretical views for the long-run which never ends.
Modern inter-bank-liquidity-based-open-market-operations-driven monetary policies have created a wide global network of financial dealers in asset markets inclusive of foreign currencies to gamble on the monetary policies through the artificially created volatility in interest rates and currency prices and to make profit at a loss to some others through speculations and volatility created by languages of new forward guidance-based policy communications. The Turkish President in his national speech made on August 10, commenting on the currency turmoil erupted in the Turkey in early August labeled them as economic hitmen of interest rates and currency plots.
As long as banks stay out of speculative dealings, monetary policy noises cannot have a major impact on banking systems in modern economies because banking is the ground manger of the macro economy as compared to desk-top managed monetary policies. In market environment, banks tend to supply bank money to match its demand, and any excess supply of bank money cannot prevail long because it would be costly to banks. Therefore, banks do not need to worry too much on the monetary policies and should carry on orderly business of money creation to provide for the demand for the liquidity to the wider real economy.
If banks get panic on the current wave of global monetary policies of interest rates and currency wars by betting on the loud noise of the US monetary policy-tightening or normalization and global responses, possible wrong decisions taken by banks to early prepare for unknown uncertainties may cause numerous risks to banks’ fund management.
Arrange Industry Surveillance
Industry co-operation is vital for protecting the trust in the banking industry. In general, banks themselves cut facilities to other banks (natural system of banking) at the on-set of a panic which results in the closure of the inter-bank market and exacerbating the banking panic. Excessive competition on new products and exposures without any industry analysis and awareness calls for banking crises. No banking or regulatory experts thought that the fee-based warehouse credit lines offered to shadow banks and corporates would be one of the key drivers that brought the chronic liquidity crisis into the banking system at the on-set of the last global financial crisis.
In this regard, banking associations which normally operate to bargain with the regulators and the state on taxes and regulations at present need to get re-organized to play a lead-professional business role in discussing and focusing on the industry stability issues as they know the ground situation of risks to their businesses. In fact, Central Banks were evolved from healthy banks who became early-stage correspondent banks or bankers’ banks by providing clearing facilities to banks and emergency funds to temporarily illiquid banks that indirectly helped the system stability. In early banking communities, some banking businessmen got together and arranged emergency funds to illiquid banks in order to avoid the industry-wide contagion in some occasions.
The alignment of the long-developed banking eco-system covering regulation, accounting standards-setting and monitoring, credit information, payments clearing mechanism, deposit insurance, credit rating, ombudsman and bankers’ training to suit local banking sector stability needs is also required as an external safeguard to the monetary and banking system. The eco-system provides a pitch to take risks with some safeguards to the system. Therefore, safeguarding the eco-system without allowing any of it to get into the grip of private profit-frenzied business hands or friends in the mask of innovations and reforms is also an urgent need that requires an on-going surveillance of banking industry associations.
Various industry associations which now operate on stand-alone basis with different motives should start performing lively as expert groups on respective banking business lines within an industry umbrella body to protect industry’s stability interests. There are several other areas that require the attendance of industry expert groups. This initiative will help prevent stresses and risks of emergence of customer interest groups in the event of building up of an unhealthy perception on banks. As such, the banking industry itself is the best overseer and guardian of banks to prevent banking crises in future.
The banking crisis literature after establishing state-controlled monetary systems shows that regulators and governments will appear only after the crisis hit and the damage began to banks, economy and public. The state rescue operation is a painful political campaign that brings all sorts of discriminations to banks. It is a mystery why Lehman Brothers was let to fail causing the acceleration of the last global financial crisis in 2008 while all other unregulated big investment banks and AIG who were equally responsible for the causes of the crisis were rescued in the US. The notion of the too-big-to-fail while letting small players die in the so-called leveled-playing field that governs the state rescue operations is highly undemocratic because industry catastrophes are always created by the big ones. It is not the democracy if lifelines are given to the misbehaved rich while letting the majority poor who followed such rich to die during times of disasters created by the rich.
When there are small banks operating with difficulties even after few decades in business, the state granting new banking licenses due to whatever reasons should be a concern to the banking industry because each new bank will be a new risk to the system, despite whatever their business models and technical projections are. Further, the expectation of the state rescue may be bleak in future due to already excessive sovereign debt globally which may even cause public bankruptcies during crisis times as shown in some emerging and advanced market economies in the past. Such fundamental issues must be concerned by industry associations.
Concluding remarks
In reality, money and monetary systems are produced and governed by banks although they may not think so. However, their real economic contribution is not adequately recognized by the public due to the lack of knowledge on risk-taking by banks and resulting misperceptions. The history shows that money and banking crises occur from time to time due to lapses in bank business models with inappropriate risk-taking, given the monetary role of banks and fundamental problem. It is only little that the regulators and the states can do to prevent such crises, given the structural weaknesses involved in operations of public authorities and states in bank money-dominant monetary economies. Any state rescues in the event of crises will create immense complications and difficulties to banks through new rules and regulations and to the public through new taxes and debt. Therefore, it is the duty of the banks themselves to protect them if they are to be in good health in a sustainable manner for generations. The root for such protection is the conduct of business with a greater focus on the safeguard of the customer trust in place of the sugar high profit.
Above are only few thoughts that would help bankers to be mindful of facts surrounding their sustainability when they run their businesses if they are concerned about preventing money and banking crises in future in their own interest. However, a fundamental fix for the systemic risk problem of bank-money-dominant monetary economies with the present evolution of e-moneys, private crypto-currencies and private local currencies to avoid financial crises and recessions in future will take at least this century until a new monetary system is invented.
