President urged to retain CSD Director General

A group of Civil Security Department (CSD) personnel had appealed to President Maithripala Sirisena to refrain from transferring CSD Director General Chandraratna Pallegama until their probation period is complete and almost 39,000 CSD personnel receive their letters of permanency.
The letter signed by the heads of relevant districts said the President had kept his promise and fulfilled a pledge made to the CSD personnel to grant them permanency and avail the almost 39,000 personnel to receive a pension.
On the day that the President completed his 100 days in office on April 4, 2015, all arrangements were made to grant permanent employment status to the employees who were on a daily wage basis at the time.
Having rendered a great service to the country during the war as a support service to the forces, they were unable to obtain a loan or own a house as they were employed on a daily wage basis.
However, having being made permanent employees of the CSD, mainly through the efforts of the President and CSD Director General Chandraratne Pallegama, today, they are able to live comfortably with their families.
However, their probation period is scheduled to end on April 23 and their letters of permanency are to be handed over to them on that day.
Therefore, they urged the President to allow the current DG Pallegama to remain in his post at the CSD until the process of making these employees permanent is completed.
