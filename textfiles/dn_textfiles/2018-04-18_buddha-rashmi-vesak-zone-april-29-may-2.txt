Buddha Rashmi Vesak Zone from April 29 to May 2

The Buddha Rashmi Vesak Zone 2018 and the exposition of the Sacred Relics and the display of Buddhist creations organised by the Gangaramaya Temple together with the Prime Minister’s office will be held for the 12th consecutive year from April 29 to May 2 at the Gangarama Temple, Temple Trees, the Beira Lake roundabout and surrounding areas.
Addressing the media yesterday at the Seemamalakaya of Gangarama Temple, Ven Dr Kirinde Assaji Thera of the Gangaramaya Temple said the Buddha Rashmi Vesak Zone is the only Vesak Zone organized by both public and private sector institutions. Two pandals and 220 vesak lanterns will be displayed at the Vesak Zone.
He said the exposition of the Sacred Relics and items of religious significance, discovered during archaeological excavations will be held at Temple Trees.
The inauguration of the exposition of the Sacred Relics will be held at Temple Trees on April 29 at 7 pm, under the auspices of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The exposition will be held until May 2 and devotees will be able to witness the exposition from 9.30 am to 4.30 am.
The Ven. Thera explained the Sacred Relic of the Buddha brought from Saranath in India and Thakshila in Pakistan will be exhibited at the exposition.
The Sacred Relic of Buddha brought from Pakistan will be displayed at the Sedawatte Veheragoda Temple on May 3 and it will also be displayed at six temples in Galle, Matara, Kurunegala, Anuradhapura and Kandy from May 4 to 15.
The Chief Incumbent of the Gangarama Temple Ven. Galaboda Gnanissara Thera said the Buddha Rashmi was initiated 12 ago on a concept of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and this is the third Vesak zone hold under the present government.
“We have no competition with other Vesak zones in Colombo and have requested the Colombo Municipal Council to join all Vesak zones by decorating all the streets with Buddhist flags and lights,” the Thera said.
Ven. Gnanissara Thera invited Sri Lankans of all religions to join Vesak Celebrations by lighting at least an oil lamp at their homes in order to make Sri Lanka a country free from internal and external conflicts. He stressed on the importance of involving people living in the North and East in the Vesak celebrations to bestow blessings of the Buddha. Buddhists cannot forget the Northern part of the Island which is a spiritually significant location for Buddhists. Arhat Sangamitta landed in an ancient port in Jaffna, Dambakola Patuna with a Bo sapling.
Ven. Gnanissara Thera pledged his support to exhibit the Sacred Relics of Buddha in the North to confer the blessings to the people living those areas. Prime Minister’s Secretary Saman Ekanayake also spoke.
