“Survey of Financial System” authored by P Samarasiri, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, was presented the President, Prime Minister and Finance Minister last week at the Presidential Secretariat.
This is the fourth book authored by Samarasiri and published by the Central Bank in the national interest. Other three books also were presented to the President at the same time.
The book is targeted for students, teachers and policymakers who look for primary knowledge on financial transactions and operations of a financial system. The book presents the financial system based on five components covering money, central bank, financial institutions, financial markets and financial safety net mechanism with a special focus on Sri Lanka. The book is reader-friendly and provide a good guide to readers to study and understand how a financial system operates.
In the book, Samarasiri shares his practical experience on several areas of financial transactions. A person who reads this book can learn risks and returns of their financial transactions and behaves prudently to protect its money and financial wealth.
Samarasiri counts 35 years’ service in the Central Bank in various high ranking posts and claims wide knowledge and experience in economic and financial policies implemented by the Central Bank from time to time. Therefore, the knowledge he shares in these four books is of national service. Nobody in the Central Bank or any other state institution has authored such a number of books in the public interest.
All these books are available in the Central Bank’s Publications Sales Counters in Colombo, Rajagiriya and Regional Offices and Book Sales Counter of the Institute of Bankers of Sri Lanka, Borella.
