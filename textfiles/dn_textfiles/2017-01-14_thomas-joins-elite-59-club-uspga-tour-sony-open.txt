Thomas joins elite 59 club at USPGA Tour Sony Open

LOS ANGELES Jan 13: Justin Thomas eagled his final hole to card a rare 59 in the first round of the USPGA Tour Sony Open in Hawaii on Thursday.
Thomas, winner of the Tournament of Champions on Sunday at Kapalua, rolled in a 15-foot eagle putt at Waialae's Country Club's ninth hole to finish the first round on the par-70 layout at 11-under.
The 23-year-old American became the seventh player -- and the youngest -- to post a sub-60 round on the US tour.
“It was obviously a fun day,” said Thomas, whose spectacular effort gave him an early five-shot lead in the opening round of the US PGA Tour's first full-field event of 2017.
With afternoon starters still on the course, Americans Russell Henley, Gary Woodland and Tony Finau, Scotland's Russell Knox and Australian Cameron Smith had all made it into the clubhouse on 64.
“I just kind of had it rolling out there,” Thomas said. “All my birdies were easy -- it wasn't like I made any long putts or anything.” But Thomas wasn't blind to the significance of the number.
“We all know it's the magical number in golf,” he said.
Most recently, Jim Furyk carded a record 58 at the Travelers Championship in Connecticut in August.
Furyk also has a 59 on his tour resume, as does Al Geiberger, Chip Beck, David Duval, Paul Goydos and Australian Stuart Appleby.
Thomas had opened his round with an eagle at the 10th, where he hit his tee shot 315 yards and holed out from 34 yards out in the fairway for a two.
He had eight more birdies and a bogey on the day, and kept his sizzing form going with a nine-foot par-saving putt at the eighth.
“That save on eight was huge,” Thomas said. “It gave me a chance because I knew if I hit a good drive on nine I was going to have a seven- or eight-iron in.” But his drive at the par-five ninth found the bunker.
