Youth hospitalised following alleged police assault

A youth who had been allegedly assaulted by two officers attached to Hettipola Police, had been admitted to the Chilaw Hospital recently.
The victim had been identified as 19-year-old Kanishka Balasooriya, the son of a late army intelligence captain who was killed in an LTTE suicide bomb attack in 2000.
Balasooriya had been treated at the Kurunegala Hospital for three days, prior to being transferred to the Chilaw Hospital and later, the Colonbo National Hospital, on July 19.
The victim’s mother, Sudarma Balasooriya, said that they were running a filtered water business. She said her son had been recently abducted by two assailants in his own vehicle, adding that when the vehicle was intercepted by police near Anamaduwa, the suspects had fled the scene, and her son had been subsequently assaulted by the said two police officers. Pallama Police had recently apprehended two suspicious individuals wandering in the Madawakkulama.
However, when they had informed Hettipola Police regarding the arrest, they had dismissed the matter.
When queried, Hettipola Police said that they had no need for the suspects as the relevant police officer was absent at the station, adding that they would investigate it if only someone were to lodge a complaint.
