PUBLIC DEBT STOCK: A PUBLIC BURDEN OR A PUBLIC BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC FACTOR?

Public debt comes up for debate from time to time as part of a political subject although it has a wider coverage as an economic and social subject. In such debates, most analysts quote public debt level as a percentage of the country’s income, i.e., Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Some argue that the current level of debt around 78% of GDP (end of 2017) is too high. Some others argue that there are advanced countries with debt levels more than 100% and, therefore, Sri Lanka’s debt level is not alarming. Political analysts generally blame the previous government or the current government for raising the debt level. No one seems to question the Central Bank being the debt manager for the past 68 years whether the country’s debt is at a sustainable level.
Problem in Public Debt Numbers
The debt level is generally looked at as a comparative number, i.e., percentage of the country’s income, as the absolute debt number (Rs. 10.3 trillion as at end of 2017) is not generally meaningful to show its level. Although debt has been several times the government’s annual total income (561% as at end of 2017), it is generally compared with the country’s income. The current debt level of 78% of GDP may mean that the government can pay-off all debt in full if the public is prepared to live with 22% of income in the year and pay the balance as tax to repay debt. However, it is a meaningless statement since nearly 46% of the public debt was foreign debt which required foreign exchange of nearly US$ 31 bn as at end of 2017 to repay such debt and the country is not able to buy such a volume of foreign exchange as compared to its total foreign reserve of US$ 8-9 bn.
Debt numbers have a lot of dark corners. In some years, the debt level rose even above 100% of GDP and the country has survived. Between 1987 and 2005, the debt level rose above 90% of GDP in all years except for one. The debt numbers also can be creatively managed by getting certain state corporations to borrow direct on government guarantees to finance public projects based on creative business justifications so that the government debt book is not directly affected. Debt data base and valuation are also complex stuffs. All foreign debt has to be revalued at the current exchange rates to know the actual size of tax burden to the public. In the case of non-market debt issuances, there is no way to know the actual financial receipt and cost of debt issuances.
The compilation of GDP also unreasonably impacts on the debt ratio. When the GDP estimation system is periodically updated on new production data base (new base years), the debt ratio immediately declines. An analyst who does not know such technicalities would look at the debt ratio and give comments favourable to debt management. In the same count, the comparison of the debt ratio with advanced economies is highly misleading as advanced economies can sell debts easily at low interest rates as their debts have an attractive global market as their currencies are global reserve currencies. In the last decade, these countries expanded their fiscal spending through debt as a standard economic policy to recover from the last global financial crisis.
Further, the public is not aware of any internal or external audit or internal controls and reporting systems on debt management in normal financial governance. It was recently revealed that issuances of Treasury bonds and Treasury bills which constituted nearly 43% of the reported debt stock as at end of 2017 have not been audited in the recent past.
Debt has various facets of business and economics. Therefore, rather than blaming the government for debt purely based on these dark numbers, we need to look into businesses and economic cases whether public debt profile is justified. As the public does not have information, policy-making officials could do it and advise the government and pubic on facts appropriately.
Business case for debt in general
Debt is a business factor in modern monetary economies with markets. Debt allows mobilization of savings to create production, income and employment through utilization of such savings. Almost all businesses are highly debt-financed. Most savers cannot do own businesses on self-savings as they are not entrepreneurs and, therefore, savings are marketed in modern economies. In business, debt is compared with own capital/savings, known as the leverage ratio (assets/capital ratio). The sustainability of the leverage level depends on the health and scale of the business and its cash flows (exiting and projected). Unless they speak for repayment of debt without causing problems to the business, there is no business case for debt as such debt will end up in a bubble and a burst one day causing a catastrophe or bankruptcy irrespective of the profile of the debtor and debt manager. If a business is financed through the roll-over of debt or debt trap where debt is repaid by issuance of new debt, the catastrophe is a matter of time because the business could be largely a Ponzi scheme or financial fraud.
A business case for public debt
The government has to provide the public service that serves as the foundation for the businesses of the country. Whether the public service is education or health service or law and order or regulation or state enterprises or social security, all are expected to promote economic activities and living standards of the public. Whatever policies the government takes will have an impact on its future finance as well as the rest of the country. Therefore, debt is always about business management in the future. Both debtor and debt manager have to live in future minds.
If the current cash flow of the government is not adequate to continue public service, the government has to borrow. All kinds of public service involve in public funds or government finance that decides the scale and the quality of the fiscal policy or the financial side of the government. If the cost incurred in providing public service (government expenditure) is greater than the price charged (the government revenue), there is a deficit in public funds that has to be financed by debt. In recent five years, annual government revenue or tax rate was 12% to 14% of GDP. In contrast, the total cost of public service was 17% to 20% of GDP. Accordingly, annual debt raised to fund the fiscal/cash flow deficit has been 5% to 6% of GDP. This has gone up in a wide range of 8% to 19% of GDP in 20 years during the past four decades.
The accumulated financial outcome of the fiscal cash flow deficits on public service is the public debt stock, 78% of GDP as at end of 2017, that should be repaid by the public, present and future. Since 1950, a cash flow surplus was reported only for two years, 1954 and 1955. When the public service is much more weighted for social safety than improvements to economy’s production capacity, the outcome will be more debt. In this background, debt service is mostly done by issuance of new debt and, therefore, the government’s cash flow may not be a good business case to support the current debt level.
Looking for further business cases for public debt
Above cash flow numbers also are not realistic. Everybody knows that the government revenue is lower than the potential due to usual tax evasion while the cost is inflated than actual due to various dark corners of public service delivery system where state funds are leaked out to individuals without due utilization. Therefore, other business cases for debt must be explored.
First, physical infrastructures such as reservoirs, roads, ports and airports or state research and development or education and health for human resource development or state regulatory framework for healthy markets can be assessed against the debt and other funds utilized for those services. For this, we may prepare a list of such services along with cost, deliverables in form of certain output indicators and unit cost at least for high cost services. In the case of project-based debt, feasibility reports that lie in office stores can be assessed. In the case of international sovereign bonds, all bonds were issued to fund development projects and, therefore, listing of the development projects funded by sovereign bonds and their current business outcome would be useful. Almost all foreign debt has been approved by the Monetary Board independently from the debt manager duty of the Central Bank. This exercise will show whether the debt manager and the principal have performed for a business case.
Second, if the above business case is not strong, we can have a list of physical assets/properties of the government valued at current market prices and use it as the government’s capital to argue on the accounting solvency of the government/public. If the government has assets more than the debt stock, it is solvent.
Looking for the macroeconomic case for public debt
We may also look at macroeconomic perspectives of public debt. First, fiscal deficit financed by debt is a text-book macroeconomic policy to promote income and employment opportunities. The fiscal stimulus in the developed countries to recover from the last global financial crisis 2007/09 still prevails.
Second, the public debt market sets the ground for the monetary and financial system. Government securities issued to finance fiscal deficits through debt are considered as safer and liquid investments as compared to private debt and equity. Central banks buy government securities to print money and drive the monetary policy. Interest rates on public debt provide the basis for interest rates to be charged from private borrowers, i.e., government debt interest rate plus a premium to bear higher risks of private borrowers. Accordingly, the yield curve or the series of interest rates across all maturities of government securities drives the financial markets. Investors buy government debt as a part of their investment portfolio to reduce risk profile. For this purpose, an active public debt market with transparency is vital for financial markets and economic activities. Benefits of market development by way of liquidity and price discovery are amply recognized in current economics.
Third, opening of public debt to foreign investments can increase the tapping of foreign savings to develop the market and to support the balance of payment deficits and foreign reserves in the event the private sector is not strong. Meanwhile, this will open up the country’s economy to known risks of international capital flows unless systems are in place to manage the risks.
We may assess whether the public debt has served above macroeconomic role. First, the government has been raising debt under-cover at forcefully low interest rates from state funds and administratively negotiated rates from private investors in the closed doors, both government’s discipline in business debt and financial market development have been lost. Same time, when the dealers are funded by some other state funds, no market outreach, liquidity and price discovery can be expected. Therefore, there is no way for the government to know whether debt has been raised at possible lowest cost and risks although the debt manager may claim so. In the absence of audit and external scrutiny, dark corners of debt issuances and management can never be known easily.
Second, as debt is a business to a network of dealers and investors, market without transparency and standard infrastructure (trading platforms, securities depository, trade data and regulations) is an oasis for all sorts of insider dealings and market manipulations for their benefits. In this context, private debt and equity markets have not developed while the bank intermediation drives the financial system and real economy. Third, concentration in foreign debt and investments has exposed the economy to currency crises. For example, the current trend of capital flows has caused considerable risks to roll-over of existing foreign debt and foreign reserve of the country which can have contagion to other sectors of the economy. Therefore, the macroeconomic case for the public debt appears to be weak. However, the fiscal policy has a strong economic case until the private sector becomes strong to drive the economy through the market mechanism.
A reasonable alert to the way forward
Elected governments change from time to time due to wishes and beliefs of the majority public and, therefore, those who operate governments may not consistently follow up on debt numbers or any business and economic cases for debt outlined above. The fiscal catastrophes including debt defaults are reported from countries from time to time due to poor debt management not supported by strong business and economic cases. We must be mindful of post-mortems of those instances which are mostly similar as they will help us to improve the discipline in public service and debt management without waiting for disasters to happen and to blame other parts of the world.
For example, we now blame the US for the current currency depreciation problem. Relevant monetary policy authorities who had frequent missions to the US knew the planned and well-communicated policy of the US interest rate hikes from zero since 2015 towards normal interest rates (now projected to be around 3% to 3.25% in 2019/20) as part of normal monetary and business cycle. Still, the US policy interest rates have been raised only to 2%. As a result, foreign capital has begun to flow back to safer US investments with reasonably higher interest rates which has caused considerable depreciation of currencies of emerging market economies including Sri Lanka. This is to continue in next two years if the current US monetary policy and growth momentum prevail. International dealers and investors demand relatively higher interest rates from these economies if they are to retain capital. The public debt is the worst victim of this currency depreciation, given its high exposure to exchange rate and foreign investors and less preparedness.
Therefore, we need to stop blames and commence work now if we wish to prevent any burst of a possible debt bubble in future as Sri Lanka is not a country that can seek an international bailout on favourable terms, given its geo-political track record. In this regard, it is necessary to re-fix the public service delivery system, budget and debt management to create a strong business and economic case for debt to be fair by the country’s new generation who has to repay the existing debt stock.
