Dambulla MC members sworn in

New Dambulla Municipal Council (MC) members who had been elected during February's local government (LG) elections, were sworn in before former Lands and Land Development Minister and present Parliamentarian Janaka Bandara Tennakoon on Tuesday.
During the recent LG polls, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna had won majority at all wards in the area. Accordingly, 13 public representatives including two women, had been elected.
Former Dambulla Mayor Jaliya Opatha was sworn in as Mayor once again, while Sameera Jayasekara was sworn in as Deputy Mayor.
