GMOA to launch token strikes

The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) will launch their token strike series today. Five more districts will be affected by the strikes today, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press briefing held at the GMOA headquarters in Colombo on Tuesday, 12, he said that the five districts (and all State hospitals located within them) which will be affected by the token strike to be launched from 8.00 am today to 8.00 am tomorrow are Anuradhapura, Kurunegala, Kandy, Ratnapura and Galle districts.
According to Dr. Aluthge, the vehicle parade which commenced on September 12 will reach Colombo on September 15 and the entire Colombo city will be blocked. There will be a giant protest rally against SAITM on the same day. The GMOA warns the public not to travel to Colombo on 15 except for an essential requirement. The Government should take the responsibility for all the hardships to be faced by the public.
The GMOA will give a hard practical reply if the Government establishes an 'Accreditation Council' overpowering the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) which is an independent body established by Act number 40 of 1988 and the Ceylon Medical Council (CMC) which was established by the Medical Council ordinance number 24 of 1924, he said.
