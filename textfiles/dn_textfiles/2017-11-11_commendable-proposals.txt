Commendable proposals

The new method proposed in the budget to support the upcoming entrepreneurs is very valuable. They will get access to capital with easy collateral and without major conditions, Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, Colombo District Chairman Dr. Amila Kankanamge said.
"The proposals give importance to technology and human resource to improve the standards and quality of products," he said.
"The agriculture should be transformed from subsistence level to modern, implemented low cost methods and issued insurance for the farmers whenever natural disasters destroy their crops," he said.
"The encouragement given to all small-scale and upcoming entrepreneurs should also be commended. The proposals should be implemented as soon as possible," he said.
