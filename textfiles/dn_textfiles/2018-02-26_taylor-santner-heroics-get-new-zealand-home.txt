Taylor, Santner heroics get New Zealand home

Hamilton: A century by Ross Taylor and lusty late hitting by Mitch Santner delivered a last-over victory to New Zealand against England in their first one-day international in Hamilton on Sunday.
In a match filled with twists and turns, the outcome hung in the balance until Santer smacked a six in the final over to get New Zealand home with four balls to spare.
Rival captains Kane Williamson and Eoin Morgan both said the initiative “ebbed and flowed” throughout the match.
“There wasn’t much between the sides and I think that’s reflected in the result,” added England skipper Morgan. AFP
