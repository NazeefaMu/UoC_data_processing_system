No connection to Lalith, Anusha conviction

Welikada Prison hospital Medical Officer Dr.P.M.Senadheera said that there is no connection between the charges against the acting Chief Medical Officer of the Welikada Prison hospital Dr.N.Thenuwara and the imprisonment of the ex-Secretary to President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Lalith Weeratunge and former Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (TRC) Director General Anusha Palpita convicted in the Sil Redi case.
Addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, he said there have been a number of malpractices at the prison hospital over the past three years. But,Dr.N.Thenuwara tries to show that she was transferred because Palpita and Weerathunga were admitted to the prison hospital. However, this is untgrue and a distortion of the facts which is against medical ethics.
“No action was taken against malpractices that took place at the Prison hospital over the past three years eventhough we have made several requests to the Prisons Minister and the Health Minister.That is why we have again handed over a report with 26 charges to Minister Senaratne, which outlines the details of professional misconduct by the current Acting Chief Medical Officer.
The Health Minister has accepted our memorandum and handed it over to the CID for further investigation.
The Health Minister had instructed the Acting Director General of Health Services Dr.Jayasundara Bandara to transfer the Acting Chief Medical Officer of the Welikada Prison Hospital to the National Hospital following discussions with us. Dr.J.K.Malwatta will be appointed as the Acting Chief Medical Officer of the Welikada Prison Hospital until the vacancy of the Chief Medical Officer of the Welikada Prison Hospital is filled.
“Dr.N.Thenuwara was transferred to avoid any interference with the investigations.
This transfer to the National Hospital has been granted to her with affect from last January, but it was not implemented. Her appointment is also wrong because there had been two senior doctors who were more suitable for the post,”Dr.Senadheera said.
“There was an investigation to probe rampant malpractices at the Prison hospital earlier following our requests to the Health Minister.
Accordingly, several persons responsible for the charges were transferred on the recommendation of the investigation report and appointed Dr.N.Thenuwara as acting Chief Medical Officer of the Welikada Prison hospital. But, malpractices have not end enventhough this doctors was also appointed to the post,” he added.
