My five visits to the  country manifest the  openness and willingness  on the part of the  government to engage in constructive dialogue
Delivering on Transitional Justice

Sri Lanka is a different place than it was at the end of the conflict in 2009.
Roads connect the South to the North and East, free of rigorous military checkpoints. Foreign direct investment and tourism are up.
On the surface, it would appear that the process of transitional justice, or a society’s attempt to come to terms with a history of violence, is steadily underway.
But Dr. Pablo de Greiff, the top UN expert on the subject said in his official visit to Sri Lanka last week that the country continues to “deprive” itself of the benefits of transitional justice.
“The process is nowhere close to where it should have been more than two years later,” he said in remarks at the UN Compound in Colombo on October 23.
De Greiff said that political fighting was slowing down the country’s path towards transitional justice.
Once a central aspect of the 2015 elections, the term “transitional justice” has since become mired in partisan debate.
The hard-right Buddhist group Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) fuels this fire with their rhetoric of Sinhala nationalism, consistently opposing investigations and reform. Politicians in the joint opposition seem happy to toe the line.
Undelivered promises
Meanwhile, many in Tamil civil society point to areas where they believe promised transitional justice measures haven’t been delivered. Students at the University of Jaffna went on strike last week protesting the detention of prisoners held under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, a law which the government has promised to replace.
“The anti-transitional justice voices have become too strident,” said Mario Gomez, the Executive Director of the Colombo-based International Centre for Ethnic Studies. According to him, those elements are holding the government “captive”.
“The government needs to communicate that transitional justice is not just for the Tamils, Muslims, and families of the soldiers,” he said.“Sri Lankans will not reconcile unless they deal with the past, however hard that may be.”
Transitional justice benefiting all communities
In his multiple public remarks in Sri Lanka this month, including two lectures in Jaffna and Colombo, Dr. de Greiff also argued that transitional justice mechanisms could benefit all communities, both majority, and minority.
“Transitional justice processes are nothing like ‘witch hunts,’ they do not involve massive purges and do not trade on charges of collective responsibility or guilt by association,” he said.
Instead, he argued, a transitional justice agenda that delivers truth, justice, reparations, and guarantees of non-recurrence would build trust in the government and bridge communal divides.
“It is worth recalling that this is a country in which every community has victims,” he said. “So, in addition to the Tamil victims during and at the end of the conflict, a quick list of victims that are still awaiting redress include … many victims of terrorist attacks, the family members of the over 600 policemen gruesomely murdered in 1990, and the Muslim population forced out of Jaffna in 1990.”
No one is safe if violence is tolerated
He said the narrative that victims are from only one community, and are seeking retribution against a majority-controlled government, was a result of manipulation and “gross simplification.”
“The1971 (JVP) insurrection, and the 1987-89 violence, and LTTE violence against Tamils are examples of intra-communal violence, showing what we know to be the case,” he said. “Wherever violations are tolerated, no one is safe, and that the violations tend to recur.”
De Greiff is from Colombia, a country with a long history of civil wars, and is the first and only-serving UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, reparation, and guarantees of non-recurrence.
Drawing from his work around the world, “I am totally convinced about the potential of transitional justice measures to achieve significant transformation,” he said. While Sri Lanka has started a variety of transitional justice measures, like establishing an Office of Missing Persons and funding a housing project in the war-affected North and East, he said the country is missing a robust agenda touching on all four elements of transitional justice.
“They are not like items in a menu in which people can pick and choose,” he said.
But he said such thinking is common in post-conflict societies.
For example, while the government is attempting to shed truth on events that occurred during the war, like through the Office of Missing Persons, the truth must be accompanied by justice, he said. He argued that in effect, revealing that someone was killed extrajudicially, but prosecuting none of the executioners, amounts to a broken promise.
War crimes of both sides should be investigated
Yet instead of making moves toward robust investigations of alleged war crimes, both by the Sri Lankan military and members of the LTTE, the government has promised from the highest levels that war heroes will be “protected.”
“Prosecution of the last phase of the war is unlikely to happen in the near future,” concluded Gomez, the head of ICES.
But de Greiff argued that prosecutions could be conducted in a way that is fair to both the alleged victims and perpetrators.
“Sifting precisely between the legitimate and lawful use of force and the contrary, under conditions in which all relevant due process guarantees are meticulously adhered to, and in which not only the rights of victims but also the rights of suspects and the accused are protected, is one of the points of transitional justice accountability,” he said.
Kumaravadivel Guruparan, the head of the Department of Law at the University of Jaffna, agreed that due process in justice proceedings must be followed in order for the government to gain the trust of all its citizens.
That lack of trust is why students at the University of Jaffna are boycotting classes, he said. They believe the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which was enacted as a “temporary” measure in 1979 to make it easier to detain people suspected of terrorist associations, has been used to violate Tamils’ due process rights.
Guruparan said that de Greiff is aware of these ongoing tensions, and had a fine line to walk in his closing statement.
Government willing to engage with UN
On the one hand, there’s been no “significant structural change on any of these issues,” he said. But unlike the previous government, the Yahapalanaya government has shown that it’s willing to engage with the UN and the international community.
“My five visits to the country manifest the openness and willingness on the part of the government to engage in constructive dialogue,” de Greiff said at his end-of-mission press conference.
While speaking in Jaffna, at the Jaffna Public Library, de Greiff drew a metaphor from the history of the famous building.
The public library was one of the largest in Asia when it was burned in a riot in 1981. The library has since been restored and re-opened and remains one of the most beautiful buildings on the island.
“I think human beings do not only endure but prevail. And I think that is true of the library as well. It has not only endured but it has prevailed, and I think that transitional justice can make a modest contribution to human beings not only enduring but prevailed over very, very difficult pasts,” he said.
But at the end of his 14-day official visit, he delivered a warning to all Sri Lankans.
“The success and sustainability of transitional justice depend also on the conviction of people that defend it, that define it, decide it, and implement it,” he said.
