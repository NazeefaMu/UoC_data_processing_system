Delimitation work: Faiszer requests more time

 
Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha requested from the President and the Prime Minister to give him sufficient time to carry out the delimitation work in the correct manner.
He made this request addressing the 'All-Party Conference on Demarcation of Wards of Local Governments' at Grand Monarch Hotel in Thalawathugoda yesterday.
The minister said about 2,000 appeals have been received to the Appeal Committee on National Delimitation appointed by him on the instructions of the President and the Prime Minister.
He said going through all of them has become a strenuous task because of time restrains.
"If the delimitation was not done in the proper manner, fingers could be pointed at our officials and the government. The criticism leveled at the previous committee for delimitation was an example for that. I want to make sure that such criticism will not occur again," Musthapha said.
He also reiterated that the next Local Government elections should definitely be held under the new system.
"Some are still asking whether the next Local Government elections will be held under the old system or the new system. With the Amendments to the Act in 2012, the new system that elects 70 percent of the representatives from the wards system and the balance of 30 percent from the proportional representation system was established. Now we cannot revert to the old system," he said.
"During the previous elections we pledged to introduce a new electoral system sans of preferential voting system. We should hold the Local Government elections under the new system keeping with this promise. However, the delimitation issues must be solved before holding the elections. I request the support of all party representatives to carry out the delimitation in the correct manner. A summary of the content of all appeals received to the committee was presented to all party representatives.
Our aim is to resolve the issues pertaining the delimitation with the consensus of all of them," the minister said.
Musthapha presented the summary of appeals received to the Committee to President Maithripala Sirisena during the occasion.
The all-party conference was called following a request by Minister Kabir Hashim, who is also the Chairman of the Cabinet Subcommittee to inquire into the delimitation.
Representatives from all the registered political parties, officials of the Elections Commission, members of the Polls Observation Groups and district secretaries were invited for the conference.
Based on the agreements made at the all-party meeting and the inquiry report of the appeals, the delimitation is to be gazetted again by the subject minister.
Appeal Committee on National Delimitation Chairman Asoka Peiris said the report of the Committee is scheduled to be finalised by January 15, as Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya has requested a minimum of 56 days to make arrangements to hold the Local Government Elections.
However, he observed the task was complicated adding that there were about 500 appeals that they could not even open yet.
Peiris added there were some issues that exceed the mandate of the committee, but needed to be resolved before the elections.
