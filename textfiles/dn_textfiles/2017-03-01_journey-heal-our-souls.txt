Journey to heal our souls

In March our past and future will be debated at the Human Rights Council. The purpose of this piece is to argue we have sufficient knowledge and means to show acknowledgement of our past.
As a country as have many others internal strife has been part of our history. More recently two insurrections in the South and the other in the Northern and Eastern Sri Lanka. Each has left scores as victims and victimizers. Back In 1971, I woke up in London learning of an insurrection in Sri Lanka. After the JVP was proscribed in 1983 once more an underground movement became overtly violent by the late 1980s. The Youth Commission report thought it had shown us how to prevent future recurrences.
LLRC report
In the North and East several more Government Commissioned platforms heard victims and recommended action. Here are references in LLRC report commissioned by former President Rajapaksa relevant to this article about our last war -
1. Some specific instances of death or injury to civilians
4.286 - The Commission stresses that there is a duty on the part of the State to ascertain more fully, the circumstances under which such incidents could have occurred, and if such investigations disclose wrongful conduct, to prosecute and punish the wrong doers. Consideration should also be given to providing appropriate redress to the next of kin of those killed and those injured as a humanitarian gesture that would help the victims to come to terms with personal tragedy, both in relation to the incidents referred to above and any other incidents which further investigations may reveal.
2. Conclusions regarding the conduct of the Sri Lankan Security Forces during the movement of civilians and combatants into cleared areas
4.319 -The Commission must also stress in this regard that if a case is established of a disappearance after surrender to official custody, this would constitute an offence entailing penal consequences. Thus the launching of a full investigation into these incidents and where necessary instituting prosecutions is an imperative also to clear the good name of the Army who have by and large conducted themselves in an exemplary manner in the surrender process and when civilians were crossing over to cleared areas, which conduct should not be tarnished by the actions of a few.
3. Channel 4 video
4.377- The Commission therefore recommends that the Government of Sri Lanka institute an independent investigation into this issue with a view to establishing the truth or otherwise of these allegations and take action in accordance with the laws of the land. Equally, the Commission feels that arrangements should be made to ensure and facilitate the confidentiality and protection of information and informants.
5. Human rights
5. 6 -There is an urgent need to assist the victims and their families to overcome the trauma they suffered due to the conflict, and to bring the perpetrators of any human rights violations to justice. There is also the essential need to ensure that lessons from these past incidents be learnt in a manner that they will never be repeated again.
5. 37- Reconciliation is a process. Closure is the first difficult emotive step in that long and complex journey irrespective of whether they are victims of conflict or victims of LTTE terrorism. This will also enable them to seek appropriate legal remedies including compensation.
6. b Reconciliation
8. - The development of a vision of a shared future requires the involvement of the whole of society. Acknowledging the losses and suffering of the past and providing mechanisms for recompense, social justice and for restoration of normalcy and expressions of empathy and solidarity, are steps aimed at redress.
8.149 Since reconciliation is a process and not a onetime event, the efforts towards that objective should be continuous and broad based whilst being fully supported by the elected Government.
Healing of personal and communal memories
In the words of Fr. Michael Lapsley “the first step is for all of us to admit that we are a damaged people. I believe that we need a new national conversation to speak about our pain. We need a new language in which we can begin to speak about what we are still carrying deep within us that is still infecting us. We need to learn to listen to one another.
Whilst we speak about our pain we also need to build a moral society. However it does not help if we push an idea of family which excludes the reality of millions of our fellow citizens. We need to accept that many people live in patchwork families where there are single parents, as well as those where children have two fathers or two mothers. The question is how can our patchwork families with all their variety be supported to be places of care, love and nurture where our children can flourish and be secure.”
He continues by asking, “is it well with your soul? Is it well with the soul of this nation? Have our deepest wounds healed? What about each of us here today, not to mention our fellow citizens? Are we at peace with everything that has happened to us in our lives? How much have our lives been shaped and misshaped by not only what happened to us but also to our parents and grandparents and great grandparents and our wider families?”
I argue we know enough to acknowledge our victims and acts of victimisers. A sample of a massive body of literature available is quoted here. We must invest on our people ourselves.
The moral injury to lives and the spiritual injury due horrendous brutal acts have to be acknowledged by wider society and not only by a section if we are to truly reconcile and prevent future relapses.
