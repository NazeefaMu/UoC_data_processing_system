The highest award at Trinity College the Ryde Gold medal was presented to the best all-round student of the school to the cricket captain E.M. Hasitha R.B. Boyagoda who was also named as the best sportsman of the year at the schools prize giving held on Friday under the distinguished patronage of president Maithripala Sirisena, who was the chief guest.

The Ryde Gold Medal is awarded annually to the best all-round student in the school and it can’t be won more than once. It is awarded on the result of a secret ballot conducted among the senior boys and the staff whose votes, together with that of the principal, each count as one. While this system makes deadlock possible there have been only three occasions in all its history that the medal has not been awarded as a result of the three votes going to three different people. Boyagoda made the highest score in Under 19 ODIs batting in the match against Kenya in the Under 19 World Cup in New Zealand. Last year when he was the vice-captain of the school team he won the coveted “Lion” and that season he scored 1,000 runs. He was Trinity College’s best Advanced Level student in Commerce stream in 2017.
Trinity-Thomian Canon de Saram Shield rugby
There are some exciting rugby fixtures on the cards for today chiefly among them Trinity College hosting S. Thomas’ College Mount Lavinia. Both sides probably lost more games than they would have liked last term and will be keen to post a win. This will be the 41st encounter for the trophy, they first played in 1955, and trophy first came to be awarded in 1978, in memory of Canon R.S. de Saram. Last year S. Thomas’ were hosts but Trinity won 29-14 and regained the Canon R.S. de Saram trophy. Diluksha Dange of Trinity College was awarded the Player of the Match.

St. Anthony’s-Kingswood at Nittawela
A rousing game of rugby is on the cards when the two home teams in the inter-school division I tournament, Kingswood College and St. Anthony’s College clash at Nittawela. Kingswood who beat Trinity College in their last outing, are capable of upsetting the Antonians, who are smarting after they were beaten by Josephians. In this game a fully fit Kigswoodians are expected to make a world of difference from the earlier three games. They are backed by a set of gallant fighters. Antonian trump card is their penetrative back line, who are level headed players, who can be good fighters if they play hard. So, in today’s game, it all points to a battle of wits between Kingswood forwards and Antonian power play. A Jamaldeen will handle the whistle.

Muslim brother schools Big Match out again
Madina Central College Madawala and Azhar College Akurana have a rich cricket history which shouldn’t be buried with the sands of time. For the last four years the big match has not been played due to some problem. Madina Central College is a school that is from Madawala and Al Azhar College in Akurana. They have some good cricketers, and the encounter is named the “Battle of the Double Maroons”. This is the only big match in the country between two Muslim schools which commenced in 2008.

Great efforts made to revive netball
Efforts are being made to review netball in Kandy. Whatever the limited facilities, Kandy has continuously produced some of the top netballers. Netball has a long history over here.
The Kandy Netball Association should get together and organise a tournament among schools and clubs in the region. Kandy schools have a rich history in the sport of netball, having played the game much earlier than others. Kandy Girls High School became the first to play netball in Kandy in 1920.
Hillwood College in 1921 were the second school to play the sport. Later, Mahamaya Girls College which was started in the 1930’s took up the game in a big way. Good Shepherd Convent, St. Anthony’s Convent, Pushpadana Girls’ College and in recent times Seethadevi, Swarnamali, Hemamali, have taken up the game and produced good teams. There are many international schools too, playing the game especially Gateway who are doing well.
New Mayor Kessara to boost sports?
The newly elected Mayor of Kandy Kessara Senanayake, should give a helping hand for sports.
At one time KMC gave a big hand for sports through the Playgrounds and community centres but today it is not up to the mark, with most of the community centres being closed and play grounds in a bad state. Every citizen of Kandy is expecting a lot from the new Mayor to give a helping hand for sports.
