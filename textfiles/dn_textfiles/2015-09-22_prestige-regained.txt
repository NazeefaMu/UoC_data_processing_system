Sri Lanka back on world stage
Prestige regained

Sri Lanka is a land of much natural beauty and after 2009, the state had an unprecedented opportunity to build on the skills of her people to build a internationally respected and prosperous nation. The state had the opportunity to ensure law and order, good governance, and durable peace and stability. Instead, under the former regime, religious violence, militarization, discrimination, media oppression, and hate speech continued. Sufficient justice and restitution was not afforded for victims of violence and violations; peace of mind was not afforded for the families of the disappeared.
When the Sri Lankan state could have accelerated reconciliation efforts and built on the goodwill of the international community, evident after the defeat of the LTTE, to foster better relations with the world and harvest all the upshots of such relations - she did not. Instead countries like the US, the UK, Canada, Germany and India, once our close allies in the fight against terrorism, became more distant and sometimes antagonistic in their relations with the Rajapaksa government. Under the directions of the former leadership, Sri Lanka entered into a historically anomalous period of international isolationism.
Suffering in Sri Lanka continued, as violations remained unchecked, and the heavy hand of oppression and authoritarianism tightened its hold. When Sri Lanka's own citizens could tolerate no more, they took large risks to vote, in conditions of great uncertainty, for a change in regime on January 8th. All communities in Sri Lanka, including a large percentage of the Sinhalese population, voted for a change in regime, despite the perceived respite afforded them due to the end of the civil war. This desire for change was expressed once more on August 17th.
Many of the former regime claim that there is a deep-seeded antagonism between the international community and Sri Lankans - and with a long history of colonization, this may be partially true. However, others have noticed that exaggerating the unpleasant aspects of Sri Lanka's relationship with the world has been politically expedient to select individuals. There will always be those who fear the scrutiny of the world, fair trials and independent investigations (whether domestic or international) - these are not the true nationalists or patriots, but those who want to remain above Sri Lanka's own laws.
Boost country's post-war image
Unity in diversity
Hiding behind the idea of 'sovereignty' and the perception that the world was 'against' Sri Lanka, was common even in response to the Darusman report. However the leaders at that time, must have been deeply aware of the contradictions: For example, Sri Lanka has trade relations with, and welcomed tourists, investments and aid from many of the countries who it had identified as conspiring against the state. Some of these countries even took the lead to proscribe the LTTE abroad and provide intelligence that was critical to the eventual defeat of that ruthless organization.
Sometimes the underlying contradictions are so blatantly obvious they are simply ridiculous: one report pointed out that the previous Sri Lankan administration paid a British PR firm about three million Sterling Pounds (Rs. 545,880,000) a year to try to boost the country's post-war image - yet Ministers of the previous administration considered the UK a leading conspirator against Sri Lanka.
The saying that 'only the guilty fear the law' is important at this juncture in Sri Lanka's history. As is identifying the individuals that are now actively bargaining, pulling strings/making deals, and even attempting to influence public opinion, in order to ensure that themselves or their friends and family are not investigated or brought before a court. What are they afraid of?
In that context Udaya Gammanpilla's introduction of an indemnity bill for soldiers, can be seen as insulting to these same soldiers, since it assumes that the soldiers are guilty of war crimes - and need special protection. Why shouldn't our honest soldiers be given a chance to clear their names? Why should we assume that they are guilty? If there are some miscreants within any community of our society - those responsible for killing women and children in cold blood - then, if proven guilty, why shouldn't they face the consequences? To allow them to continue to soil the name of all our soldiers would be dishonest by the victims, but also by the honest and hardworking soldiers, who fought to defeat the LTTE. These soldiers may have ambitions to use their skills and expertise, that they have won at great risk to themselves, to contribute to world peace - why should undue ill-repute prevent them from this honour?
Government commitments to accountability are nothing new, and the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime even expressed them publicly. For example, a joint statement between the Government and the UN in May 2009 stressed the need for addressing the grievances and aspirations of all communities, the need to find a lasting political solution, and the importance of accountability. The May 2009 UNHRC Resolution (S-11/1), proposed by Sri Lanka herself, endorsed this Joint Statement and also emphasized the need for continuing commitment to upholding human rights obligations and norms of human rights law.
LLRC recommendations
In 2010, the Commission on Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation was appointed by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to look back at the conflict and plan ahead for an era of healing and peace building. It advocated non-recurrence, recommending that allegations should be investigated and wrongdoers prosecuted and punished irrespective of their political links, that the issue of missing persons should be addressed, and that devolution, land release and resettlement should also be pursued. The UNHRC resolution (19/2) of March 2012 acknowledged the LLRC recommendations as constructive, calling on the Sri Lankan Government to fulfil the relevant legal obligations and commitments made willingly by the Sri Lankan state.
In fact, acknowledgement of the climate of conflict in Sri Lanka and the articulation of a commitment to address the underlying causes of conflict has been a consistent feature of successive post-war administrations. The international criticism heaped on Sri Lanka, was a result of the failure of previous administrations to live up to their commitments in multi-lateral and bilateral fora. Instead of fulfilling her commitments in previous years, Sri Lanka's cycles of violence continued over the last decade.
Failure to ensure justice for crimes in Sri Lanka, gave some the impression that they were above and beyond the law - contributing to today's culture of impunity. This culture of impunity is indiscriminate, accentuated by politicized and failing judicial and law enforcement systems, and it affects all communities in Sri Lanka. Ensuring that those who commit crimes are held accountable is crucial to deter crimes in the future, to prevent impunity and to stand by Sri Lanka's own post-war commitments to the world.
Systematic and structural reform has been a large aspect of how Sri Lanka has dealt with past incidents of violence; the JVP insurrections in the 70's inspired a comprehensive package of state led reforms that radically restructured economic relations. Land reforms, ceilings on income and house ownership, education reforms and poverty alleviation schemes were all part of the drive to prevent recurrence of class-based violence. Introducing structural changes to Sri Lanka that fill the lacunas in our much deteriorated judicial and law enforcement systems and prevent ethnic violence from reoccurring would therefore be in line with our own domestic best practices.
Now Sri Lanka has the opportunity to make a change - to try suspects in a court of law not because of their ethnicity, gender, religion, caste or creed, but because there is evidence that they may have illegally harmed another individual in this country. Sri Lanka has included prosecution as an inherent dimension of justice since the pre-colonial era, and its current legal system unambiguously contemplates the punishment of offenders. It has in the past rejected the idea of impunity for violence by prosecuting offences committed by persons holding public office, including politicians, public servants and members of the armed forces. In that context, previous government narratives of tolerance, kindness and forgiveness, of restorative justice to the exclusion of accountability before the law - are simply inconsistent with past practice in Sri Lanka, and a façade that would ultimately enable impunity. Sri Lankans must ask if they want to live in a society where some are above the law?
Sri Lankan identity
To continue to afford victims and suspects a fair trial, would only be consistent with the law of the country - where acts such as rape, torture, enforced disappearances, child conscription, and wrongful killings of individuals who surrender are recognized as crimes in our domestic law. Having a 'Sri Lankan identity' is largely about sharing the same experiences, walking freely on same land and being bound by the same laws.
The OISL report based on the OHCHR investigation in Sri Lanka suggests that there are serious errors in our protection mechanisms - due in part to acts such as the impeachment of the Chief Justice in 2013. The very fact that an international investigation was necessary to produce a credible account of what occurred in Sri Lanka is worrying - a testament to the failures of previous regimes to live up to its promises to conduct domestic investigations. It justifiably gives all Sri Lankans a reason to worry - how can we live and feel safe in a country where crimes such as torture are common?
During the war such crimes may have been frequent in the North and East, but in the last decade every Sri Lankan has been a victim of increased crime and corruption. Trying suspects against whom there is reasonable evidence, is consistent with the spirit of our domestic law - where the law applies equally to all Sri Lankans, and all individuals are equal under that law, despite their political or social status. This is a fundamental of belonging to the same country, and while fulfilling expectations for legal continuity among Sri Lankan citizens, it would also promote a shared identity among all Sri Lankans.
