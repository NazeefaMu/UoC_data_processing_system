Colombo Mayoress to probe  construction of new CMC building

Colombo Mayoress Rosy Senanayake, said yesterday, that she would probe whether corruption had occurred in the construction of a new building at the CMC premises. The report in this connection would be provided to all members in the near future.
Addressing the monthly General Meeting held at Town Hall yesterday, she said that the CMC presently has a meeting hall for a capacity of only 55 members, but that number had risen to 119, together with the overhang sets, following the recent Local Government polls.
Since the new building at the CMC premises is being constructed currently, it is necessary for moving to a new location immediately, due to lack of seating for all members at the existing premises.
Meanwhile JVP member Hemantha Weerakoon had alleged that there was no 25 percent woman representation in the CMC. Mayor Senanayake responding to the allegation, said she would look into the matter and discuss with the Election Commissioner if it was necessary.
Meanwhile, members of the Opposition alleged that Rs.5.7 million had been allocated for the construction of toilets at the Mayor’s official residence and it was necessary to allocate enough funds to construct and renovate public toilets across the Colombo city.
The Mayor said that sufficient allocations have already been approved to develop the public toilets system in Colombo.
