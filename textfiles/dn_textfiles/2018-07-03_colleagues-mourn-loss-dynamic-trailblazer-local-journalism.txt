Colleagues mourn loss of a dynamic trailblazer in local journalism

The death of Chamara Lakshan Kumara, Editor-in- Chief of the Silumina and Resa, has come as a devastating shock for his colleagues and friends in both these newspapers and the wider media world.
Expressing their condolences, Resa and Silumina staffers said that his death has left a void that can never be filled. Following are some of their views:

Janaka Liyanarachchi - Chief Sub Editor, Silumina
“I have known Chamara for the past 10 years. I first met him when he was working for Rivira. He was always a good and inspiring friend to me. He was the kind of person who questioned the existing system and principles and most importantly, he had broad ideas and views on every issue. Chamara had very deep thoughts and they were more than what we could ever imagine.
He was one of the finest editors with academic qualifications. He had the talent to cater to both younger and older generations. There was a drastic increase in the circulation of Silumina after he joined and we all rejoiced.
Chamara was given an official vehicle for his use, but he never used that.
He preferred taking the public transport and enjoyed mingling with people. As far as I know, he never misused his contacts or the positions he held.

Jayasiri Jayasekara - Chief Sub-Editor, Resa
I did not know Chamara personally before I joined Resa. He contacted me through one of my friends and asked whether I would like to join him to start a new paper. At that time, I had lost all interest in making a change through the media because in my experience the content of a paper depends on who runs it. But when I told Chamara about my perception towards the media, he immediately shook hands with me and said he felt the same.
It was Chamara and his determination to make a change that inspired me to get into the field again. After we started working together, I actually understood his potential. He was the strength of the paper. He always wanted to do something different and not what everyone else does.
Chamara had a vision to change the perception of people about religious and ethnic differences. Even though the paper is in Sinhala, he wanted to address all people irrespective of their religious and ethnic differences. He ensured that we published balanced articles. He asked us to work independently and give our best to the paper.
Especially, the Resa covered the Digana issue in a balanced manner and the Muslim Media Forum officially informed us that they wish to present an award to Resa for engaging in just and fair reporting. He is not alive to hear the news or receive the award.
I liked his approach and supported him in every way. He would have made a real change if he was alive for some more decades. I do not think anyone can fill the void left by him.

Thimbiriyagama Bandara - Features Editor, Resa
I have been in the media field for the past 30 years. I did know Chamara before by name, but only met him personally at the Silumina in 2015. Since then, he was a good colleague and friend to me.
He often would tell me that people could get more work from me and he never failed to use me to the fullest.
He was a rare kind of journalist who was vocal about his personal opinions and views. I did not refuse when he requested me to join the Resa.
Chamara’s idea was to bring give a new perspective to the paper. Not all editors are good managers, but Chamara was a good manager and a great editor. I am very sorry to have lost him. Today the accountability of media is being questioned from all sides, but Chamara always tried to balance it and give the readers a new angle to see everything.

Ranjith Kumara Samarakoon - Deputy Editor, Resa
I worked with him only for one year, but we had a close relationship. A lot of characters come into our lives, not many people become close to our hearts though.
Chamara was one of them, he is one person I never want to forget in my life. Among many media personalities, Chamara was a true journalist.
He made a huge change in the Silumina and wanted bring a huge change among the community through Resa. I would say that Resa was synonymous with Chamara.
His dream was to bring the Silumina and Resa to a good position and win the trust of the people. I think he was the youngest editor ever at Silumina. It was his sacrifice and toil which gave Resa a unique identity. Chamara’s life journey was quick and fast, but it was a remarkable one. He did everything possible in a very short period of time. He was a person who was dreaming of a long journey in the field of journalism.

Shivanthi Fernando - News Editor, Resa
I met Chamara Aiya when I joined Resa. Even though I did not know him personally before, I started reading his articles when I was at school. I have worked with many editors, but he was a very unique person. There was so much to learn from him.
When our news editor left recently, Chamara Aiya called me and asked whether I would also leave Resa. I assured him that I will not do that. But it was so unfortunate, he left everything and went before all of us.
I was shocked when I heard that he passed away. He had so many plans to improve the paper and bring it to a good position. Chamara Aiya started Resa in his own style, and it was totally new to us and eventually we adapted to it. He never forgot to encourage the upcoming journalists and lift them up.

M. Seneviratne - Head of Layout, Resa
Chamara approached me to talk about a new paper. I liked his idea and expressed my willingness to join. He is a very flexible person and he gave me opportunities to voice my opinions as well. He was a friend more than an editor to all. He was a good manager too.
