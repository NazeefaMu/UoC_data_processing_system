International consequences of Brexit

“Often the crowd betrays the people”- Victor Hugo
As Britain sets its course towards exiting the European Union (EU) this year, the EU, plagued with economic uncertainty and issues of immigration and security, has found itself questioning its very form and identity. President of the Constitutional Council of France and former French Premier, Laurent Fabius however was of the opinion that Brexit was an opportunity for Europe to restructure the Union towards a more strong alliance in future.
Delivering a lecture on “Europe and the International Order, Post-Brexit” at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute of International Relations and Strategic Studies on Tuesday, he spoke of an unpredictable future for Europe, as the extreme political right and populist ideas take hold of the political sphere of the continent.
“Though Europe is mostly moderate and strong supporters of democratic values, the extreme right is taking the lead in many polls. In Columbia at the same time, a long awaited agreement which puts an end to a 50 year civil war- an agreement awarded the Nobel Peace Prize is turned down by a referendum.
In many places, autocrats and populist ideas are taking the lead. Last June, in the UK, Brexit won in spite of the opposition stance exhibited by most rational elites. It would not be wise for me or you to take for granted the international consequences of Brexit,” said Fabius.
Europe after Brexit?
However as the European Union celebrates 60 years this year, Fabius observed that the European community was no longer that of its founding fathers.
“The European community we know today came into being in 1992. In 1973 the UK had joined the Union amidst protests from General De Gaulle and in 2004, we had the arrival of 10 member states from Central and Eastern Europe. Today we have 28 members; 27 when UK withdraws,” he explained.
“With a 510 million community our motto is ‘unity in diversity’, but today many people feel that diversity is stronger than unity,” he added.
The main reason for such scepticism according to Fabius was, “Not the rejection of the EU but mistrust of the Union’s capacity for concrete action.”
Does the Union work?
Over half a century since the establishment of the Union, member states who came together to look for joint economic prosperity have both achieved as much successes as failures. As the EU became a leading economy in the world, economic and social disparities within member states as well as between has also grown. Fabius also explained that with the rise of other economic power houses, coupled with average growth in the EU over the last few decades, the feeling of Euro scepticism has spread further.
In the advent of Brexit, perception has been ripe that the European economy would suffer further and Sri Lankan Foreign Minister, Mangala Samaraweera questioned the future of trade between the EU and Sri Lanka after Brexit, but Fabius assured that Europe would continue to be an economic power, irrespective of the impact of Brexit,
“One third of exports from Sri Lanka go to the EU and the EU is a major financier of infrastructure projects in the country. With the lifting of the fishing embargo last year and this year’s elimination of the GSP plus ban, the EU will consolidate itself as a major trading partner in the years to come,” he said.
He reiterated that perception that the EU was not doing much for the economies of its members and the world was mainly because most governments failed to communicate European achievements but were quick to blame the EU for decisions and situations they themselves were responsible for.
“The same is probably true for here. How many are aware that EU has dispensed mostly in grants, nearly 800 million euros over the past decade for a wide variety of development projects and has allocated 250 million euros on development projects by 2020? France alone gave 160 million euros for bridge reconstruction and for water projects in hospitals as part of the reconstruction after the Tsunami,” said Fabius.
Another reason for Euro scepticism was the institutional scheme of the Union which has made Europeans feel that they have less and less power over decisions that concern them, “The institutional scheme contributes to lack of vision and creates distance between Europe and the general public,” he said.
Finally a major reason for lack of faith in the Union was the issue of borders, security and immigration.
“The number of member states and its geographical expansion has been worrying. Many questions are raised over the Balkans and Turkey. There is new doubt over the European identity, questions concerning its own borders, migration and security and this played a role in Brexit and it persists in other EU countries,” said Fabius.
Despite all these concerns however, the former French Premier insisted that in the last three years alone, the Union had made ‘admirable progress’, “The EU economic policy has shifted considerably; until recently it was only concerned with Budget reconsolidation, but now the issue of growth and investment has become top priority. Interventions of the EU central bank have been positive and 350 billion euro in investment projects are planned and we have achieved a banking union for better regulation of finance.”
“Europe has also been taking action in countering terrorism, the massive inflow of immigrants and Greek Financial crisis- they may not be perfect but action was taken,” he said.
“Britain obtained significant economic concessions from the EU but the people were not convinced. It is not an easy task for a government to win a referendum and most British governments have been criticising the EU for decades so it was not easy to ask voters to remain. An important lesson in this is that very sensitive issues such as immigration which took centre stage and that led to an unfortunate result. Brexit leaves several victims in its wake- Great Britain, its member states and the EU itself,” said Fabius.
All lose?
The EU which has been annoyed to say the least with Brexit, has also started to worry that this may leave room for others to follow.
“Brexit will open a breach in the EU construction. We have made constant progress up to now and Brexit was a step back, it may open the path to other forms of divisions,” said Fabius who also worried that it would also spell a period of economic uncertainty for all.
Economic uncertainty
“To formally withdraw from the Union, the UK has to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty which provides voluntary withdrawal for member states. UK is to put it into effect by the end of March and according to the Supreme Court decision, the House of Common gave its vote and the final vote by the House of Lords is to be expected by March. And then the new terms of cooperation between the UK and the EU would be long drawn out- for two or more years,” said Fabius.
British Prime Minister Theresa May has announced that the UK will leave the single market but, as Fabius pointed out, there is no mention of what the precise rules maybe, particularly with regard to custom policies, border control, residency rights and EU migrant worker rights.
“The economic sector wants predictability and legal support,” he said.
Brexit, he predicted could also jeopardize the unity within the Union as Scotland and Northern Ireland have been opposed to it and have voiced their support for the EU.
With such difficulties created by Brexit, Fabius made it clear that the EU would ensure that the UK pays for Brexit.
International balance
“We will have to expect many changes. We do not know if the UK will continue to participate in EU field operations, such as the fight against terrorism in the Sahel or migrant smuggling in the Mediterranean Sea,” said Fabius.
The UK may verify certain positions, not so much in NATO but to the UN Security Council where it is a permanent member. He also predicted that it would probably strengthen its ties with the US- as the recent state visit of US President Trump to the UK suggested.
As for historical partners within the commonwealth, contradictory arguments were made. “Brexiters say stronger links with the commonwealth would happen but others say that a weaker UK would be less attractive and if it was opposed to EU immigration, it will be even more opposed to all immigration,” he said. Fabius also noted that EU’s weight in major conferences such as the G8 would be weakened with the UK leaving its fold.
In the end however, the precise conditions of the exit would determine international relations- whether it is a soft Brexit or hard.
In the event of a soft Brexit, the UK would leave the single EU market but would not completely cut off ties and they could renegotiate negotiateed specific customs agreements with member states and the applicable laws would be similar to that of today. Switzerland already has such an agreement with the EU.
“But many EU leaders are calling for a firm hand in negotiations, insisting that Brexit means Brexit. In other words, the UK cannot have one foot in and another out, benefitting from certain privileges while imposing restraints on mechanisms of solidarity,” said Fabius.
If pushed for a hard Brexit, a position the British PM has advocated for, there would be complete breakoff from the Union. “The vacuum will have to be encountered with new national legislation in many sectors and trade and investment by major international groups would slow down. The financial passport which allowed banks and financial institutions which established in the UK to work freely throughout EU would disappear. The British Chancellor of the Exchequer has said that if differences with the EU were wider than expected, the UK then might implement aggressive competitive tax strategy targeting its neighbours and in which event the EU would probably react and we will have a situation which is negative for everybody,” said Fabius.
Reforming the Union
The consequences of Brexit thus has made many question the future of the Union and Fabius said that this was a good opportunity to “force the EU to clarify its own strategies and operations. This is an opportunity to define the face of Europe of the future,” he said.
Prior to such a move, they would have to deal with the challenge of building a more coherent union with just 27 members, build a stronger political union to face powers such as US, China and India and to build a union with greater solidarity to foster social progress, culture, research, economic progress, innovation and sustainable development.
In addition, the biggest challenge to Europe has been changing and shifting notions of what Europe is. Migration as well as shifting borders has led to many Europeans preferring to close their doors to cooperation with others. But Fabius believed that if they could change the structure of the Union by having a ‘three circled’ Europe- they could engage differently with ‘member states’ through a concept of a differentiated Europe- making tensions between the so called ‘other’ less apparent.
“The stretch of Europe must be specified as the question of immigration, security and borders have grown urgent. Lack of clarity in these areas explains the dissolution felt by Europeans,” he said as he explained what the three circled European structure would look like.
“Europe could agree on some shared principles for say 2030 and bring together partners who are willing to move forward together- where most willing states can advance at the same pace, away from those who are not ready at that moment or who are not ready for greater integration,” he said. The concept was being discussed more as General elections in several major countries this year particularly France and Germany stressed the need for it,” he said.
The first circle which would include countries like France and Germany, would, “Move quickly to deepen their economic and social integration. These countries should determine to manage economies together and plan legal, situational and economic means to do so and cooperate on diplomatic, military, scientific and research areas. It would be open to all member states who are ready in this shared sovereignty and joint efforts this change requires,” he added.
The second circle would include all 27 member states and some of these countries over time may integrate with the first circle. “It would be wrong to force them to do so now and it will hold back the first circle from action,” said Fabius.
The third circle would then allow countries geographically close to Europe but not given membership in the foreseeable future to work with the EU.
“The Union cannot expand infinitely but this will be handy for countries like Turkey which has been involved in the process for membership for the last 50 years. Certain privileges of the EU without full membership,” said Fabius.
He advocated that this would also help the Europeans as well as non-Europeans understand the “architecture of Europe and where their own country fits in the project. This will be useful if one is to implement genuine security policy within and outside of Europe,” he said.
“For example, we can only control immigration if we are certain of the Union’s borders and the obligation of each state. If you want to build European defence policy which in no way contradicts NATO policy, we need a position on where it stands,” added Fabius.
Another possible scheme after Brexit- would be where different groups of countries could be built according to different competencies- called ‘enforced cooperation’.
“For example frontiers won’t be the same for energy, monetary or defence policy. Chancellor Merkel has said she was thinking of a possible scheme for a differentiated Europe for energy,” he explained.
No matter what shape Europe takes in future however, Fabius was insistent that there was now “Room and necessity for shift in the EU construction, and Brexit made it not only possible but necessary,” making it even more needed that countries such as Sri Lanka renegotiate its relationship with Europe as well as the United Kingdom.
