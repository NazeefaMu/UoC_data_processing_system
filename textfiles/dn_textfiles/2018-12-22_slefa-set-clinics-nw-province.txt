SLEFA to set up clinics in NW Province

The Sri Lanka European Friendship Association (SLEFA) will set up clinics in less privileged areas in the North Western Province. An Italian philanthropist and Sri Lankans in Italy fund the project. The programme commences under the guidance of SLEFA President Sylvester Jayakodi by laying the foundation stone for a clinic in Gokarella. The association will set up a children home in Dodangaslanda as well.
