Sri Lanka's growth likely to be  weak in 2018  - HSBC Global Research

SRI LANKA
A juggling act
Sri Lanka is walking on a tight rope, trying to balance the twin targets of invigorating growth in the economy while maintaining macro-economic stability.
On the one hand, the economy has been weakened by floods and droughts for the past two years. This has resulted in a complete disruption of agriculture, which has been contracting for six consecutive quarters now.
And on the other hand, vulnerabilities around macro-economic fundamentals in the form of high debt to GDP ratio, the twin deficit problem (current and fiscal deficit), a weak currency and insufficient forex reserves have kept Sri Lanka on its toes.
To fix the latter, Sri Lanka entered into the IMF reform program in 2016. Much has been done and achieved since then. Dedicated efforts have been made towards revenue mobilisation via VAT hikes and passing of the Inland Revenue Act in the Parliament, reducing fiscal deficit and embarking a more realistic consolidation path, building-up of foreign reserves and showcasing a greater commitment towards exchange rate flexibility.
While the government remains committed to the IMF’s recommended structural reforms, growth is likely to be weak in 2018 due to a fragile agriculture recovery, lower household spending and moderating credit growth especially in the services sector. The reinstatement of the EU’s Generalised System of Preferences (GSP+) in May 2017 is likely to revive exports. In fact, high frequency data so far have been promising, with export growth outpacing import growth, but it’s too early to be confident about the recovery.
The 2018 budget also tries to stimulate growth, that too on a sustainable basis. It aims at rekindling entrepreneurial spirit by improving access to credit for small- and medium-sized enterprises, enhancing trade competitiveness by the removal of tariffs, promoting tourism and attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) by doing away with land ownership restrictions and by exploring opportunities around public private partnership.
Undoubtedly, the country has come a long way trying to achieve both the objectives of growth and macro-economic stability, but things can get tricky going forward as close to LKR 7,000 bn will be due for repayment in the next couple of years. Such a huge gross financing need may require further revenue consolidation, which may be detrimental for an already slowing economy.
Sri Lanka needs to attract non-debt creating inflow and FDI is one such option. However, it has always lagged in attracting FDI compared to its neighbours. With targeted FDI inflows not being realised, it has relied on commercial borrowing to fund its deficits (balance of payments and budget deficit) to drive growth. This has not been sustainable and has led to steep adjustments in the currency and the interest rate in the last seven years or so.
Policy issues
Since 2016, the central bank has raised policy rates by 125bp with an aim of reducing excess liquidity, controlling credit expansion and to contain the build-up of adverse inflation expectations. While concerns around Sri Lanka’s credit euphoria have been mitigated by a tighter monetary policy, inflation has continued to edge higher, much outside the central bank’s target of mid-single digit.
It’s the supply side disruptions due to unfavourable weather conditions that have driven food prices higher, and thereby inflation. We believe that, as food prices stabilise in the months to come, inflation will start moderating and is likely to ease to the desired levels by 2018.
Sri Lanka’s rate hike cycle is close to peaking and the central bank is likely to keep the policy rates unchanged in the foreseeable future till the dust around supply side disruptions due to adverse weather conditions settle. A stable rate environment will also support the weak economic recovery.
Risks
Rising crude and commodity prices, along with a depreciating currency, may worsen current deficit levels, and the government may find it difficult to continue with energy price reforms per the scheduled timeline.
Also, a weaker than expected recovery in growth as a consequence of adverse weather conditions and a loose fiscal policy as the country moves closer to elections could further slowdown the pace of fiscal consolidation and raise concerns around macro-economic stability. 
INDIA
Between two worlds
India’s growth story has a two-part narrative. The first is a slowdown and gradual recovery in the short run, likely over FY18 and FY19, as key sectors revive from disruptions related to the implementation of the goods and services tax (GST). The subsequent narrative is of brighter growth prospects in the medium term (FY20 and beyond), when growth is expected to reap the benefits of recently undertaken structural reforms.
The coming into force of the GST in July 2017 slowed manufacturing activity sharply. Growth was at its slowest pace in five years in Q1 FY18 due to a massive inventory drawdown, only to pick up to a healthy 7% in Q2. However, although the sector’s Q2 growth print was satisfactory, this was not true for underlying momentum and scope. High frequency indicators such as industrial production reveal that around 40% of manufacturing sectors are still contracting while the remaining 60% are growing at a much slower pace than before. The recently announced USD32bn banks
recapitalisation scheme and amendments in the bankruptcy code should help bad-loans-ridden public-sector banks and support a revival of investment by improving credit flow in the economy.
However, the revival may be only gradual at first, as the other side of India’s twin balance sheet problem – the overleveraged corporates – is expected to linger for longer. However, reforms alone are not to blame. The rapid fall in oil prices, which supported net exports and domestic manufacturing, has reversed. With oil prices no longer falling, an important growth driver is lost, and nothing appears to be taking its place. Export growth has also slowed substantially, dragged down by domestic bottlenecks, stronger rupee and GST-disruptions.
Brighter growth prospects appear on a three-year-plus horizon (FY20 and beyond). In the medium term, GST alone may add 40bp to GDP growth through productivity gains. Then, India can be more integrated with the rest of the world by virtue of its evolving IT software exports, impressive consumption trends, vibrant start-up ecosystem, and strong demand for global capital and capital goods as the domestic investment cycle turns.
This is subject to caveats, the most important being that India must address the issue of insufficient social capital constraints; accordingly, we forecast growth at 6.5%, 7.0% and 7.6% over FY18, FY19, and FY20, respectively.
Policy issues
The inflation outlook in India has been muddied by many transient and structural factors. While it’s hard to disentangle the impact of each of these in the recent trend, we now see upside risks to inflation again. While core inflation has already climbed back above 4% and remains sticky, increasing fuel prices pose a greater risk. If food prices also begin to settle higher, possibly on the back of higher prices of perishable items such as vegetables, we could easily see 4%-plus inflation prints, due partly to unfavourable base effects.
However, we believe that, once the impact of transient factors wanes, inflation will settle in the proximity of the RBI’s 4% target, thanks largely to the virtuous fall in inflation expectations in recent years. We expect inflation to average 3.4% over FY18 (ending the year in March at 4.3%).
Accordingly, we forecast that the RBI will keep the repo rate on hold, as the rate-cutting cycle of the central bank looks set to have ended, with most inflation risks tilted to the upside.
Hikes may also be unwarranted at the moment because we have yet to see whether the current pace of economic growth is sustainable or it turns out to be as rapid as the central bank forecasts.
India’s current account deficit (CAD) is set to widen to 1.7% in FY18 and to 1.9% in FY19, and then reach 2.1% in FY20.
This would be led largely by rising imports of oil and items such as electronic goods and smartphones, reflecting changing consumer preferences domestically. Yet, riding on optimism from recent reforms and Moody’s sovereign rating upgrade, we expect financial flows into the economy to stay strong, at least roughly sufficient to finance the CAD.
On the fiscal front, there are upside risks to the central government’s 3.2% deficit target emanating from lower-than-budgeted nominal GDP growth, a lower-than-budgeted RBI dividend, and a higher seventh pay commission bill. On the other hand, increased momentum in government-led disinvestment and GST revenue may result in higher revenues, but it’s too early to be sure.
State government deficits are already high and could worsen on the back of farm loan waivers.
Risks
If the other side of India’s twin balance sheet problem – overleveraged companies– lingers for longer, the pace of the investment revival and GDP recovery could suffer.
Also, inflation may begin to rise as growing consumer demand hits the wall of supply-side constraints.
CHINA
A positive outlook for 2018
The Chinese economy staged a robust growth recovery in 2017, with real GDP growing 6.9% in the first three quarters of the year and nominal growth averaging 11.4% y-o-y. Underpinning this rebound are a private-sector-led manufacturing recovery, an export recovery, and strong public-sector infrastructure spending. We expect the manufacturing recovery to strengthen in 2018.
This additional pillar of growth, alongside stable growth in the domestic services sector, should help to offset the impact of policy tightening and SOE de-leveraging. We see real GDP growth at 6.7% in 2018. After a five-year-long downturn, manufacturing investment growth rebounded in mid-2016 and grew 4% in the first 10 months of 2017.
The modest rebound in headline growth masks a sharper divergence between the SOE-dominated ‘old sectors’, such as steel, metals, chemical and plastic, and the private sector-led ‘new sectors’, including machinery, electronics and Information
Communication Technology (ICT) related equipment.
The ‘old sectors’ have been slowing since 2011 and contracted by 0.4% in the first ten months of the year. The ‘new sectors’ have also slowed over the past few years (although they still grew at a faster pace than the old sectors) but rebounded in mid-2016, and grew 8.4% in the first ten months of 2017.
A similar divergence can be observed in industrial production as well as export data, suggesting that ‘upgrading’ is now a bigger driver of China’s manufacturing growth. We expect the recovery in this part of the economy to strengthen in 2018, helped by domestic ‘upgrading’ and also stable external demand.
Meanwhile, after a strong performance in 2017, we expect the housing market to slow in 2018. Housing sales have started to slow in a more broad-based manner, while housing starts growth has also eased. Both point to a moderate slowdown in housing investment in 2018. Moreover, sustained reflation will give policy makers more space to adjust policy. We expect the current policy stance, which is neutral, but with a tightening bias in the interbank and regulatory space, to largely continue in 2018. De-leveraging of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) will also gain pace. On the fiscal side, tighter regulations for Public Private Partnership projects may have some near-term impact on infrastructure investment.
But, for full year 2018, the expansionary fiscal policy stance should largely continue. We also expect more to be done to lower corporates’ tax burden and incentivise innovation and green investment through tax rebate or subsidies.
Policy issues
The PBoC’s monetary policy stance in 2017 is officially ‘neutral’. In practice, this has often come with a tightening bias in the interbank and regulatory space. Our HSBC China Monetary Conditions Indicator, for example, shows continuous tightening over the year. Given the robust reflationary backdrop, the impact on the real economy was largely manageable. We expect this policy stance to largely continue in 2018. The risk is for a more hawkish tone at the upcoming National People’s Congress (NPC) session in March 2018. The fiscal book has turned around quite meaningfully in 2017 and should continue to grow in 2018 given the positive growth trajectory. The Ministry of Finance has tightened regulations around Public Private Partnership projects recently, which may have some negative near-term impact on infrastructure investment in early 2018 but marginal in the context of full year spending.
We expect the expansionary fiscal policy stance to continue. We also expect more to be done to lessen the tax burden on the corporate sector and incentivise R&D spending.
Risks
With simultaneous tightening of financial and environmental regulations, there is a risk that policy goes into overdrive, derailing the growth recovery. If the upcoming NPC session sends a more hawkish policy signal, investors’ worries could deepen. This would create some downside risks, particularly in 1H 2018.
The ongoing recovery in the global capex cycle has been positive for China. It may receive a further boost if China also moves to lower corporate taxes in a more meaningful way. A further acceleration in the global capex cycle is another upside risk for China.
