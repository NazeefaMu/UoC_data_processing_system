Lawyer asks Bribery Commission to pursue former minister

A Colombo-based attorney-at-law, writing to the Daily News, has called for an appeal on the decision of the Colombo Magistrate in August 2017 against a former minister on two counts of failure to declare assets per Section 2(1) of the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Act 1975.
The Magistrate had imposed a fine of Rs 2,000, the maximum punishment according to the Act, the lawyer says.
The attorney-at-law, in the interests of the public, requests the Bribery Commission to pursue the case with an appeal to the High Court to seek conviction of the former minister, who he says 'should not go scot free'.
