V.O.I.C.E  National Youth Fest returns

The V.O.I.C.E National Youth Fest 2017 returns for the third consecutive year. It is organized by Forerunner AG National Youth Ministries along with other denomination churches with the purpose of uniting Christian youth spread across the nation, the trilingual Leadership Conference will be held on August 25 and 26 at People’s Church Narahenpita.
This year more than 1,250 youth leaders from all denominations will come together as the “Sound of Heaven” on earth in an effort to empower the future of our nation to bring positive change. The two-day conference will feature sessions conducted by the Nations Institute & Youth for the Nations, Director Christ, Chris Estrada from Dallas, Texas, Youth Alive Australia, Director, Cameron Bennett, the Youth Alive band from Australia and prominent youth leaders from Sri Lanka. Taking the youth conference to a global scale, this year teams from North India, Bangladesh and other Southern Asian nations will also attend. Sessions during the day will focus on educating youth on their role in influencing society in the forms of plenary sessions and group discussions which will also feature stories of people who have transformed society through sport, entertainment and philanthropy.
Each evening, the Youth Alive band together with local church bands will perform at a night rally open to the public. In previous years, the night rallies drew more than 4,000 youth and young adults together with their families each night. This year the organizers expect that number to increase as well.
In a generation driven by violence, oppression, injustice, and crime, the younger generation is called to raise a voice of hope to the nation. The conference and workshops create the first platform to thus empower the youth.
