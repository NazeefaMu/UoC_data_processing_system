Romance in a new guise

M Safeer is back with a new production titled ‘Swings of Love’. The drama features Italian artiste Julia Filippo. She will be carrying all the action on her shoulders since she is the only character who will be on stage to relate all the incidents centering on the drama. However a production which is based on one character along is not new to Julia. She has acted in another solo ‘Knots Rules to be Happily Unhappy’
“There are no other physical characters on stage. There are only swings which symbolizing the presence of other beings. It runs for around one hour. When you are alone on stage you feel the weight of the whole performance on your shoulders. It is a huge responsibility. However you also have the possibility to relate whatever you want to say and the time to establish a contact to take this message across,” Julia explained on her role in ‘Swings of Love’.
“This is my second visit to Sri Lanka. I was here two years ago for the Colombo International Theatre Festival. I presented the production ‘Knots Rules to be Happily Unhappy’ there. It is about a woman on the streets. She fell in love with a man, got pregnant and was thrown out of the house by her family. It is about the life of a homeless person. It is a little bit more social than ‘Swings of Love’,” she said.
Born in Rimini, Italy in 1984, Julia studied physical theater in France.; She graduated from the school Arsenale of Milan - Lecoq method (2005). She is an actress in many projects such as: ‘Un bar sotto il mare’ Novelli Theater (2003), ‘La Cantatrice Calva’ Arsenale Theater (2005), ‘Sabbia – Nessuno ci guarda’ Franco Parenti Theater (2008), ‘Dio Mercato Chorus’ Ringhiera Theater (2008), ‘Imraa, Jin, Xaniman, Women’ Hidden Theater (2009) with the direction of Annet Henneman.
In 2008 Julia directed the opera ‘La Bohème’ in Teatro dei Vigilanti. She joined the company Living Theater of New York in 2009 in the tour of Israel and Palestine and in 2010 in the tour in Belgium with many performances. From 2010 she collaborated with Teatro Era of Pontedera with the performances ‘Abito’, ‘Iter’ and ‘Lisboa’ that toured Japan, Brazil, Italy, Portugal and Denmark. She took part in the show ‘The Clinic of Blinded’ of the director Pierangelo Pompa with the company Laboratorio di Altamira in 2013.
‘Swings of Love’ recreates the sensations born in a woman on natural wonders of love, coition and violence. Julia is training for one month with the team before heading back home. Speaking about the experience of acting in a Sinhala production Julia say, “’Swings of Love’ is scripted in a poetical manner. It is about the last woman on earth. It is like an ode to love, life and women in general. Taking part in this production is a different experience for me for two reasons. Firstly I have a playwright who is very much present with us. The script is our base and we follow that. The language is also different for me. It has a beautiful rhythm.”
She stresses that collaborations are very important in artistic work.
“I believe that our attempts to mix two cultures are brave. This is forming a communication between two diverse worlds. What we bring out is something short of a miracle,” she noted with a smile adding that she has collaborated with Colombia, Denmark and France for productions.
“Those countries are more near to my own. They are all related to Italy. Sri Lanka is an Asian country. It was truly beautiful to see how many differences we have in our daily life,” Julia said adding that the language barrier was the main hurdle that the team had to overcome.
“I had to translate Italian into English while the others had to translate Sinhala into English. English is not the mother tongue of any member in the team but the language that we use to form our connection,” she said.
The premiere show of ‘Swings of Love’ is planned to be held at the Pune IAPR international theatre festival in November. It will also be staged for three special public viewings at the Korean International Dio<U+200B> Performing Arts Festival in Seoul, followed by some invitation shows around the world. The script of ‘Swings of Love’ is written by Manjula Wediwardena. It is translated into English by Dilini Eriyawala
