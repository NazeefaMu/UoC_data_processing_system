Navy helps repatriate 80 Indian fishermen

The Navy facilitated the repatriation of 80 Indian fishermen. Seventy-six of them had been taken into custody for trespassing into the Sri Lankan territorial waters and engaging in illegal fishing activities. The other four were rescued by the Navy, while drowning in northern seas on August 31.
The 76 Indian fishermen were apprehended on separate occasions by the Navy and Coast Guard for engaging in the illegal fishing method of bottom trawling in the Sri Lankan territorial waters. Bottom trawling is considered as a destructive fishing practice that causes severe damage to the fish stocks and other maritime resources. The Navy’s Landing Craft L 820 and Coast Guard’s Fast Attack Craft CG 41 were deployed for the repatriation mission.
The repatriated Indian fishermen were handed over to the Indian Coast Guard Ship ‘Sarang’ at the International Maritime Boundary Line north of Kankesanthurai on Monday evening.
