Panadura UC holds inaugural meeting

The inaugural meeting of the Panadura Urban Council (UC), was held on April 5 at the UC Auditorium. Addressing the gathering, newly-elected UC Chairman Nandana Gunathilake said, “As councillors, we all are servants of the public and therefore, we should strive to provide our services sans corruption.”
“I have prepared a project to clear all public drains in Panadura, to curb the spread of dengue. The D. W. Wijesooriya Mawatha connecting the Panadura Railway Station and Galle Road, would also be developed under this project,” he added.
Unauthorised pavement hawkers would be removed and a new public market would be erected. The government had allocated Rs. 5 million to the urban council, to initiate the building’s construction work, Gunathilake said.
He added that all dilapidated roads would be resurfaced and that committees would be appointed to collect more information regarding unauthorised constructions within Panadura.
Vice Chairman P. D. Wilman and other councillors also addressed the event. Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) and United National Party (UNP) councillors assured Chairman Gunathilake their support for the aforementioned projects. All 18 councillors that were recently elected, were present at the meeting.
