Thailand rout Sri Lanka 7/0

Sri Lanka women’s hockey team suffered yet another crushing defeat this time at the hands of Thailand losing 0-7 in their first round match of the World League Women’s Hockey Championship match played at Sengaphang, Singapore. At half time the Thais led 3-0.
This huge defeat reflects some kind of short coming in the Sri Lanka ladies team as they beat Thailand 2-1 in the league match of Asian Hockey Cup Championship last year. In the finals of the same championship they lost to Thailand 2-1 after a hard fought battle to clinch the second spot.
The Sri Lankans were represented by almost the same players last year except for a few changes which were considered necessary. Does this mean that the Sri Lankans lasses could not perform well or that the Thailand ladies have shown remarkable improvement since last year. Or motivation play an untegral role. This is something that the hockey authorities should look into when the team returns to Sri Lanka this week.
But how can they remedy this when tour itself was in balance till three days before the girls took the flight over an internal issue. This is something for the Ministry of Sports to look into and take remedial action as they, should ensure that the girls are psychologically in good shape before they are embarking on an international tour.
In the same tournament in another match played against Singapore the Sri Lankan women lost 0-6 after trailing behind 0-3 at lemons. This is a match the Sri Lankan girls won in the Asian Challengers Trophy Hockey Championship 2015.
Did the Singaporeans turn around to inflict this humiliating defeat is another matter should look into or that our women were unable to deliver the goods where they delivered last year.
With this defeat the Sri Lankan girls are out of championship honours and will end up as also rans.
