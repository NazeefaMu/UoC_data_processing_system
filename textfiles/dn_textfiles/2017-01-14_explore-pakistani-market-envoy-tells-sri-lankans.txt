Explore Pakistani market, envoy tells Sri Lankans

Sri Lankan businessmen should explore the vast Pakistani market, Pakistan High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Syed Shakeel said.
He was addressing the Pakistan Trade Fair which opened at the BMICH yesterday. The Pakistan exhibition will continue until tomorrow under the theme 'Sharing the Legacy'. It is organised by the Trade Development Authority of Pakistan.
Addressing the gathering, Shakeel said Pakistan through the embassy in Sri Lanka has taken steps to provide all facilities to Sri Lankan businessmen to strengthen links with Pakistan.
“Sri Lankan businessmen can explore the Pakistan market for their products. I can assure you that the Pakistan High Commission will provide its fullest support to those who are interested in exploring the Pakistan market,” he said.
Pakistan businessmen also concentrate on the Sri Lankan market by identifying it as a growing market, Shakeel said. He said Sri Lanka and Pakistan has had cordial ties for centuries.
Apart from relationship in other sectors, the two countries maintain a better relationship in the field of trade, Shakeel said.
"There is a long standing friendship between the two countries” he said.
Neither Pakistan nor Sri Lankan markets are new to both countries, as both countries have been engaging in trade for centuries, the High Commissioner said.
