CH has the edge over CR today

A superb game of rugby is on the cards when CR and FC play CH and FC in their Dialog ‘A’ Division inter-club knock-out quarter final rugby encounter at Race Course grounds in Reid Avenue, Colombo today, kick off will be at 4.15pm.
CR and FC in their last game lost to formidable CH and FC who came from behind 14-17 down at half time to beat them by 25 points to 24 at Longden Place in their final league game last week.
These two experienced rugby clubs in the past have produced unrelenting brand of running rugby whenever they met, same is expected today. It will be interesting to see how both sides play in today’s game. Both teams are famous for playing good quality rugby and should give the large crowd something to cheer about. Red shirts will hope to play their best available side as they are hampered and will play without some of the key players who were side lined due to injuries and thus far not recovered, hence will not play in today’s match.
This season CR’s plus point is their mobile pack, which is about the best equipped with some top class players of the calibre of Omalka Gunaratne, Supun Warnakulasooriya, Udara Gayan, Hafiz Adahan, Shemal Weerasekara, Charana Chamikara and Kokila Hiran, should deliver the goods together with the rest to grab ball position in the set pieces.
In today's game CH and FC will rely more on their speedy three quarters. Their new halves combination of young Avishka Lee and Samuel Maduwantha, who paired off well in the entire second round league games, should give their best.
Maduwantha is an intelligent player, and has class written in his play, as he often draws the opposition defense and finds the gaps with his clever foot movements for the fast moving three quarter line to do the scoring.
Mean while the CH outfit who shocked CR last week in their own den will be fielding the same victorious team which did duty for them and will be at full strength. One can easily expect a thrilling game from their playing fifteen.
CH and FC Western Samoan head coach, Tavita Thulagaese “Laga” a former Sri Lanka national coach who is a master tactician will be out to guide his side to another win in this match. Laga is confident that his team is determined to deliver the goods today.
But, one should keep in mind the CR side who has a superb three quarter line as well and if they play to their usual brand of rugby they can pierce any team defences as their ball handling is the best seen in some of the games which they won this season against top opponents especially against Navy SC in the first round game.
