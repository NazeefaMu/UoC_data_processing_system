Motion against Wayamba Governor withdrawn at 11th hour

An urgent proposal similar to a no-confidence motion on the Wayamba Governor Amara Piyaseeli Ratnayake billed to be moved in the Wayamba Provincial Council at its meeting yesterday (March 7) was withdrawn at the last minute by Wayamba Chief Minister Dharmasiri Dassanayake, saying that it would be moved on a later date.
Giving reasons for the last minute withdrawal of the proposal before the council, the Chief Minister said he was acting on the orders of President Maithripala Sirisena who spoke to him over the phone from Indonesia in the morning and directed him to withdraw the proposal.
The Chief Minister told the Council Chairman that he would take steps to place the President’s request before the governing UPFA group.
The Wayamba Provincial Council met at the Council hall yesterday morning presided by chairman Tikiri Adhikari.
From the inception of the meeting, there were whispers among the governing UPFA group about debating the proposal.
After the message was received from the President, there was suspicion among the group about the withdrawal of the proposal from the day’s agenda. After the 11 am tea break following the adjournment of the meeting, the governing UPFA group met and deliberated for nearly one and a half hours about the withdrawal of the proposal.
The Chief Minister informed the Council that the Proposal was not intended to remove the governor from her position or through an enmity towards her but solely to discuss the actions taken by the Governor which undermined the confidence of the council.
After the council meeting, opposition leader of the Council Shamal Senarath speaking to the media said this amounted to a defeat of the governing UPFA group. He said the Governing UPFA group has forwarded this proposal with the sole intention of inconveniencing the Chief Minister and putting him in trouble.
