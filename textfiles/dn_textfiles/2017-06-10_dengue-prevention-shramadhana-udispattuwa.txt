Dengue-prevention shramadhana at Udispattuwa

Students of Teldeniya-Udispathuwa Primary School conducted a shramadhana campaign to prevent Dengue at Udispattuwa junction. This programme was held parallel to the all-island Dengue wipe out one week programme, under a concept of President Maithripala Srisena.
Central Province Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake, on his way back to the office from Rangala, attended the programme and said, he would give every support for these types of works although the area is free from Dengue. He paid his gratitude to the teachers, parents and students for organizing this type of programme.
