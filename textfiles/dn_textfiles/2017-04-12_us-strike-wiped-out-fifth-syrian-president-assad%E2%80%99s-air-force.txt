US strike wiped out fifth of Syrian President Assad’s air force

SYRIA: The US strike on a Syrian air base destroyed a fifth of the Damascus regime’s remaining warplanes, Pentagon chief Jim Mattis said yesterday as Washington fired a fresh salvo of warnings at President Bashar al-Assad.
The public assessment of Friday’s missile strike and the forceful rhetoric came as G7 ministers met in Italy to send a “clear and coordinated” message to Russia over its support for Damascus.
The United States on Friday blasted 59 Tomahawk missiles at the Shayrat air base near Homs, which the Pentagon said Assad’s jets had used to launch a deadly chemical attack on rebel-held Idlib province.
“The United States will not passively stand by while Assad murders innocent people with chemical weapons, which are prohibited by international law and which were declared destroyed,” Mattis said in a statement, noting that 20 per cent of Assad’s “operational” aircraft were destroyed.
“The Syrian government would be ill-advised ever again to use chemical weapons,” he added.
Mattis’s warning came as White House spokesman Sean Spicer appeared to lower the threshold for new US action against Assad to include barrel bombs, a crude yet hugely destructive weapon of choice for the Syrian leader.
“If you gas a baby or drop a barrel bomb onto innocent people, you will see a response from” President Donald Trump, Spicer said.
But US officials later walked back Spicer’s remarks.
“Nothing has changed in our posture,” a senior administration official said.
“As the president has repeatedly made clear, he will not be telegraphing his military responses,” the official said.
Trump discussed Syria during separate telephone calls yesterday with British Prime Minister Theresa May and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
May and Merkel “expressed support for the action of the United States and agreed with President Trump on the importance of holding Syrian President Bashar al-Assad accountable,” the White House said in a statement.
Downing Street said Trump and May had “agreed that a window of opportunity now exists in which to persuade Russia that its alliance with Assad is no longer in its strategic interest.”
The two leaders were looking to US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s trip to Moscow this week as an opportunity to lay the groundwork for a “lasting political settlement,” May’s office said.
Iran and North Korea have slammed Washington’s retaliation and put it on a direct diplomatic collision course with Moscow, where Tillerson heads today for talks with Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov.
Johnson on yesterday called on Moscow to do “everything possible to bring about a political settlement in Syria and work with the rest of the international community to ensure that the shocking events of the last week are never repeated.”
French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said the pressing task for the G7 was to “find a political solution, a political transition” in Syria, particularly if the West wanted to triumph over the Islamic State group.
Italy arranged a last-minute meeting for today between the G7 ministers and their counterparts from Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates.
Italian media said the aim was “to avert a dangerous military escalation.”
Japan’s Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida said he told Tillerson that Tokyo supports the US in its push to “deter the spread and use of chemical weapons,” and discussed the pressing North Korean nuclear threat. - AFP
