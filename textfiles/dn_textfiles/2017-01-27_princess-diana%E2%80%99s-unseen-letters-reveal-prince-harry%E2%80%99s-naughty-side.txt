Princess Diana’s unseen letters reveal Prince Harry’s naughty side

Prince Harry was known for getting into trouble during his teenage years, but it turns out the royal has always had a rebellious streak.
Personal letters written by Princess Diana reveal Harry was “constantly in trouble” at boarding school, the BBC reports.
The handwritten notes, which were sent to former Buckingham Palace steward Cyril Dickman, also describe how the close bond between Harry and his older brother William developed when they were young.
“William adores his little brother and spends the entire time swamping Harry with an endless supply of hugs and kisses, hardly letting the parents near!” Diana wrote in one letter dated March 2, 1985, when Harry was just a few months old.
“The reaction to one tiny person’s birth has totally overwhelmed us and I can hardly breathe for the mass of flowers that are arriving here!”
In a later correspondence from July 1993, Diana updated Dickman on how Harry, then aged 8, was getting on at school. “The boys are well and enjoying boarding school a lot, although Harry is constantly in trouble!” she wrote.
The touching letters will be sold by Cambridgeshire auction house Cheffins on 5 January. Items from the collection of royal memorabilia, which also include Christmas cards signed by the Queen and Prince Philip, are expected to reach between £80 and £900 ($99 and $1,108).
