England beat New Zealand to reach Champions Trophy semi-finals

CARDIFF June6, 2017: England booked their place in the semi-finals of the Champions Trophy with an 87-run win over New Zealand in Cardiff on Tuesday.
Victory meant England had won both their opening Group A games following their eight-wicket defeat of Bangladesh at the Oval last week.
New Zealand, set 311 for victory, were bowled out for 223 with 39 balls left in their innings.
Fast bowler Mark Wood took the key wicket of Blackcaps skipper Kane Williamson to dismiss the star batsman for 87.
Earlier Joe Root’s 64 and Jos Buttler’s quickfire 61 not out were the cornerstones of England’s 310 all out after they lost the toss, with New Zealand pacemen Corey Anderson and Adam Milne taking three wickets apiece. Victory meant England were through to the last four of a tournament featuring the world’s top eight one-day international teams regardless of the outcome of their last group match against arch-rivals Australia at Edgbaston on Saturday.
Jos Buttler’s quickfire unbeaten 61 helped take England to a total of 310 all out in their Champions Trophy match against New Zealand in Cardiff on Tuesday. England, sent in to bat in overcast conditions by New Zealand captain Kane Williamson, were in danger of failing to get to 300, despite fifties from Joe Root (64) and Alex Hales (56).
New Zealand, who saw pacemen Corey Anderson (three for 55) and Adam Milne (three for 79) share six wickets, fought back well with the ball.
