Deliberate disrupting of Constitutional Reform procedures:Hakeem

City Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauff Hakeem said the Joint Opposition’s (JO) decision to resign from the Constitutional Reforms Steering Committee(CRSC), had clearly emphasized that JO was deliberately engaged in disrupting the Constitutional Reforms procedure.
Hakeem also said that United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) MP Dinesh Gunawardena’s statement of disregarding JO’s views and opinions in the Constitutional Reforms procedure was no more than a falsification.
He was speaking at the launching ceremony of the book in relation to the Kandy and Suburban water supply project to be implemented with financial aid from Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) at Tourmaline Hotel in Kandy yesterday. Minister Hakeem said that decisions on the contents of the Constitution had not been finalised yet, while several parliamentarians had been allowed to present their suggestions to the Constitutional reforms Sub-committees to the steering committee are being dissolved already, he added.
Hakeem further said that amendments of Local Government elections would result in an increase of councillors by three fold from the present number and attention should be given in relation to whether the Treasury could bear the increase in councillors.
Minister Hakeem also said that there were over 50 amendments to the Local Government elections and that there were significant errors in the Delimitation Committee report. It would also be inequitable for small political parties under the amended Local Government electoral system, he added.
He said that amended Local Government electoral system is a combination of proportional electoral system and first past the post electoral system. Though it was said that there is capability to conduct this hybrid electoral system by 30% , the actual chance would be 23%, he added.
