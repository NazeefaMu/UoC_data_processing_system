Act now on climate change

Several districts in Sri Lanka have experienced a severe drought for the past several months. A few areas such as Anuradhapura witnessed rains last week, but the other areas are yet to receive rain. Residents have to trek miles to get drinking water or wait till a water bowser turns up. Agriculture and livestock have been severely affected, adding more woes to an already battered economy in these regions.
This is just one of the signs that climate change is real and happening in our region too. Rainfall patterns have changed drastically over the last few decades and droughts have become common. And when rain finally comes, devastating floods occur. This applies to the whole of South Asia, not just to Sri Lanka.
This is why we need a collective South Asian response to the problem of climate change. Fortunately, all eight SAARC countries are signatories to the Paris Climate Accords and it should be possible to take action right now to turn the tide. This is essential, because extreme temperatures in South Asia could reach dangerous thresholds by the end of the century if greenhouse gas emissions are not curbed, according to an alarming new study published in the Science Advances journal.
A two degree rise by 2100 has already been predicted for the world as a whole, but South Asia’s fate could be worse. Millions of people in one of the most populous regions could face serious heat danger if the planet reaches high-end warming levels projected for 2100. Researchers say the disastrous scenario could be avoided if countries meet their commitments to keep temperatures from rising more than 2°C by 2100.
Human beings, like any other animal, have their physical limits. Above certain temperature and humidity thresholds the body can no longer function properly and will eventually die. South Asia has already experienced what it would be like - a heat wave in India and Pakistan in 2015 killed roughly 3,500 people.
Here is the biggest paradox – South Asians are the least responsible for climate change, but seem to be the most vulnerable. These are people who did not contribute to the root cause of the [climate] problem, notes Elfaith Eltahir, a hydrology and climate expert at MIT and one of the study’s authors. The accumulated emissions have been contributed primarily by the rich fraction of the world’s population, he adds. This research shows the kind of outcomes that could happen if we keep going in this trajectory of no action related to climate change or minimal action.
Eltahir’s modelling uses wet bulb temperature, a scientific measurement that combines temperature, humidity, wind speed, sun angle and cloud cover to measure heat stress in direct sunlight. This has been chosen because temperature is not the only element of weather that affects the human body. Generally, a wet bulb temperature of 35 degrees Celsius, or 95 degrees Fahrenheit — approximately the temperature of the outside of the human skin, which tends to be a few degrees cooler than the body’s core temperature — is likely to be lethal after just a few hours.
Lethal wet bulb temperature refers to a condition that almost universally leads to death within about six hours unless people are able to get away from the heat, such as by going indoors into an air-conditioned space. This presents another problem – not many households or even companies in South Asia can afford air-conditioning. Any mortality at a time when air conditioning technology is broadly available will be clearly unacceptable. The effects of unchecked temperature rise would extend beyond the health concerns associated with being outside in high temperatures. With workers unable to stay outdoors for extended periods of time, the region’s economy and agricultural output would also decline.
There will probably be more intense typhoons and cyclones as global temperatures go up. As mentioned previously, the rains could be far more devastating. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has forecast fewer rainy days, but more intense rainfall. This means more flooding, and less rainwater getting the chance to percolate underground to recharge aquifers. An increase in temperatures will also result in a global sea level rise. Nineteen of the 25 cities most exposed to a one-metre sea-level rise are in Asia. Islands such as the Maldives face the biggest risk, because they could literally disappear.
Recent surveys show that the South Asian public is very much aware of the negative effects of climate change. A recent Pew research survey completed in India found that 47 percent of the participants saw climate change as a major risk. Sri Lankans are also now aware of the negative effects of climate change after repeated exposure to drought and floods. However, the local media should launch more awareness and educational programmes on climate change in all three languages. Climate change must be incorporated to the science curricula in schools so that children will gain an understanding of how they could reduce their Carbon footprint. Indeed, all South Asians must do their bit from now on to save their region from becoming a parched land.
