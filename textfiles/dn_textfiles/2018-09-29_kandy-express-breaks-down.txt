Kandy express breaks down

Trains along the main line were disrupted last evening due to the breakdown of an express train on the upward line at Keenawala.
The Kandy-bound evening intercity express train from Colombo Fort broke down at Keenawala in Veyangoda and a tense situation among the passengers was reported due to this.
A spokesman from the Railway Department said that angry passengers on the train had blocked the other line too disrupting all train services.
However, both lines were cleared for trains after about two hours from the incident.
