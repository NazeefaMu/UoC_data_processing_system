Strange pet laws!

- In the city of Turin, Italy, you are required to walk your dog at least three times a day or risk a hefty fine.
- In Saudi Arabia, walking a dog in public is illegal. Dogsare almost completely banned, with the exception of working dogs.
- China enforces a one-dog policy, in which every family is restricted to one dog, should they choose to have one. Additionally, all dogs must be under 4 inches in height.
- Small dogs are becoming increasingly popular due to a loophole in German tax laws, which allow any dog under 10 pounds to be taxed at the same rate as a rodent - one third the rate.
- In Switzerland, you must pass a test and take a practical training class in order to have a dog. If you are a first-time dog owner, you have to take a theoretical class apart from a practical training class.
- In Little Rock, Arkansas, US, your dog cannot bark after 6 pm. It’s the law!
- Anyone caught making “ugly faces” at a dog in Oklahoma, US, is subject to fines or even jail time. The dogs surely appreciate it, but enforcing this rule can’t be easy. Can someone define “ugly faces”?
