Litro expects negative results for 2017

Although Litro Gas had a good financial year in 2016, this feat would not be able to be repeated in 2017, said Chairman SLI, Hemaka Amarasuriya. He said that the global gas prices have risen and to match it no price revision has been allowed by the authorities. “This will have a major negative impact for our gas business and the negative result would be shown next year.”
