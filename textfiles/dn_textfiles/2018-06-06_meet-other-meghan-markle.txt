Meet the other Meghan  Markle

Oh, look, it’s Danielle Harris, a 33-year-old from the U.S.
Or is it Meghan Markle, former actor and the new Duchess of Sussex?
It’s easy to get the two confused, apparently, as Danielle claims she gets mistaken for Meghan Markle at least four times a week.
Just to add to the mass confusion, Danielle also got married (back in January 2017) and wore a white wedding dress.
So that’s two women who are mixed race, have freckles and dark hair, and were once a bride. How on earth are people supposed to tell these two apart?
Danielle’s wedding was a little different to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s, mind you, costing $50,000 – just 0.001% of the price of the royal wedding.
While Meghan wore Givenchy, Danielle wore a simple white gown that cost $1,800 (£1,348). While Meghan got married in St George’s Chapel, Danielle tied the knot in Clayton on the Park in Scottsdale, Arizona, USA.
Meghan had 600 guests, Danielle had 115. Meghan’s wedding was pretty fancy considering it was a royal affair, Danielle’s was a giant party with guests dancing to a local DJ.
So, yeah, a few key differences there.
But no, that doesn’t stop the Meghan comparisons, says Danielle.
‘My husband and I were in the Gucci store in Dallas and they were taking so long to wrap up my things I couldn’t understand it,’ says Danielle.
‘Until all the sales associates came out of the back to meet me. It was so funny. ‘On Friday I was standing in the grocery store line and this old lady in front of me had a magazine with Meghan on it.
‘She started doing a double take and said “Has anyone ever told you..” but I just finished her sentence for her.
‘Everyone always tells me “Danielle, you need to get a job as her double”. My husband even jokes that he’d be my manager.
‘It was four years ago when a mutual friend first said to me that I look just like Rachel Zane, Meghan’s character in Suits.
‘I didn’t watch the show then, but I couldn’t see the similarities when she showed me the picture.
‘I didn’t think much of it until the past year or so when Meghan and Harry’s relationship became public.
‘If I had five dollars for everyone who has said I look like her over the last 12 months I would be so rich.’
Thankfully Danielle isn’t bothered by the comparisons.
‘We’re both mixed race and I also have freckles like Meghan,’ she says.
‘She’s so beautiful I think it’s a huge compliment when people tell me we look alike. It makes me laugh.’
