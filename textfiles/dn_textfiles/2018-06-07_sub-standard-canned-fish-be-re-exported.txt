Sub-standard canned fish to be re-exported

All consignments of canned fish which does not meet the standard will be re-exported back to the country of origin and all authorized officers at border control, and at Divisional, District and Provincial level remain alert that the food imported to Sri Lanka meets the food safety regulations, Health Services Director General Dr. Anil Jasinghe said.
Issuing a special statement yesterday, he said there had been 184 batches in 60 consignments (175 containers) of canned fish imported since April 11 and tested at the Food Laboratory. Out of this number, 149 batches were identified as not meeting the required standard.
According to Dr. Jasinghe, the Food Advisory Committee (FAC) in May directed that all consignments not meeting the required standard be re-exported to the country of origin. The FAC also requested that authorized officers at divisional level be informed of batches failing to meet the standard, to ensure increased vigilance.
