CDM students receive recognition at SLIM

The Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM), a renowned National Marketing body for Marketing with nearly 50 years of experience is setting the precedent for Marketing education in the country.
SLIM recognizes the necessity for future Digital Marketers to hone their skills and take on the future with confidence and as a result introduced an innovative programme to their extensive educational portfolio this year, known as the Certificate in Digital Marketing (CDM).
The first intake of the inaugural CDM Batch completed the programme and was recognised for their efforts at the SLIM Certification Ceremony held recently.
Digital Marketing is also known as the marketing of products or services using digital media and technologies, mainly on the Internet, but also including mobile phones, display advertising, and any other digital medium.
This branch of Marketing, which promotes products or brands via digital media, differs from traditional Marketing as it involves the use of channels and methods which enable an organization to analyse Marketing campaigns and understand what works and what doesn’t for each particular promotion. Digital Marketing facilitates customer relationships across all channels both digital and traditional, and is thus an integrated approach towards Marketing.
The Certificate in Digital Marketing (CDM) is a preliminary course designed by SLIM to help students understand the fundamentals and various aspects of Digital Marketing and the online communication ecosystem.
Students gain essential skills in planning, organizing, leading, controlling and decision-making within the innovative, three month-long programme which consists of five Modules. While 50% of the content emphasize on theoretical concepts, the remainder concentrate on professional practices with project-based learning opportunities.
The Certificate in Digital Marketing is delivered with a blended focus on academic and professional orientation.
Speaking at the ceremony, Pradeep Edward, Vice President of Education at SLIM said, “We at SLIM introduced the Certificate in Digital Marketing programme after well-conducted market research, being aware of the massive demand in Digital Marketing at present,” he stated. “Students can be assured of guidance by well-qualified resource persons, including visiting lecturers who are practicing Digital Marketers, holding senior positions in top corporate industries who will provide insights on ‘the big picture’ by using examples from the local and international arena.”
Also commenting on the programme , Sanath Senanayake, SLIM CEO and Executive Director noted, “I am positive that candidates even with preliminary Marketing know-how would be keen to gain Digital Marketing knowledge by following the CDM course. The Certificate in Digital Marketing by SLIM is going to be one of the most sought-after programmes in the island as time goes on. Our syllabus, textbooks and course content are prepared to suit current industry requirements,” he concluded.
