Wants FM to summon Myanmar Ambassador, hold debate

Muslim Congress raises concern for Rohingya people:
The Muslim Congress of Sri Lanka (SLMC) yesterday called on Foreign Affairs Minister Tilak Marapana to summon the Myanmar Ambassador in Colombo to share their concerns with the Government of Myanmar, urging an immediate end to violence against the Rohingya people, in the interest of peace and stability in the region.
SLMC leader in a letter to Foreign Affairs Minister requested for a debate or session in Parliament, suo moto, to explain the position of Sri Lanka.
The full letter:
Not a single day passes without the international media as well as the human rights community reporting on the crimes being committed against the people of the Rakhine Province of Myanmar.
The unfortunate plight of the Rohingya people has been staring squarely in the face of humanity for a few years now, with his intensity at unprecedented levels in the last few weeks.
When crimes against humanity are perpetrated against a people on the grounds of race, religion, language, or ethnicity, or on any other grounds, which appear repugnant to human conscience, it is our collective duty to do all that within our power to help bring an immediate end to it, ensure amelioration of eh conditions of persecuted people, and to work with partners in the region and the world to facilitate their peaceful living including return and resettlement in safety and dignity, with guarantees of protection and non recurrence in the future. It is our strong belief that Sri Lanka, under the National Unity Government, is in a position to demonstrate initiative and or leadership in ensuring such a positive outcome through peaceful means.
We would like to propose in this context that the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs:
Summon the Ambassador of Myanmar based in Colombo to share our concerns with the Government of Myanmar, urging an immediate end to violence against the Rohingya people, in the interest of peace and stability in the region.
Offer relief and rehabilitation assistance to the affected people through international agencies;
Issue a public statement demonstrating its clear interest in addressing the situation faced by the Rohingya people and ensuring the situation faced by the Rohingya people and ensuring peace and stability in the region;
Call a debate or session in Parliament, suo moto, to explain the position of the Government of Sri Lanka urging for non-violence and peace building in the Rakhine Province of Myanmar.
In our well considered view, the Government of Sri Lanka is well-placed to undertake all of the above measures as a country progressing on the path of reconciliation, non-recurrence and peace building, an committed to the pursuit of peace and stability in the region which remains critical to the realization of is vision of a harmonious, inclusive, sustainable Indian Ocean, as part of its Vision 2025.
We would encourage the Government of Sri Lanka, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to initiate the above measures and demonstrate commitment and leadership at the earliest.
