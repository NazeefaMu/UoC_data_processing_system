Making the elderly computer literate

“Sri Lanka is facing a huge challenge to make its older generation computer literate,” Minister of Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Harin Fernando said recently. Provisional statistics available at the Registrar General’s Department show that 43.476 percent of Sri Lanka’s present population of 21.444 million people are over the age of 35 years, while statistics released by the Department of Census and Statistics show that only 15.45 percent (1.440 million) of them are computer literate.
“Even the figures I have received from the ICT division of Parliament indicate that more than 80 percent of the MP’s do not use laptop computers or ICT facilities available in Parliament. It is difficult to influence the older generation to adapt to new technology and that is why we launched the ‘Tablet Project’ for schoolchildren, because we want to start young,” the minister said.
With the increasing use of smart phones and launch of the ‘Tablet Project’ for students, over ten thousand free Wi-Fi zones would be established and internet accessibility would be available island wide. As a result the Computer Literacy Rate (CLR) is expected to reach over 60 percent by 2020.
Children below 9 are more computer literate than adults over 50.
The data available shows that CLR is at its highest among youth in the 15 to 19 age group and lowest among elders in the 60 to 69 age group. It is a fact that there are more children in the 5 to 9 year age group who are more computer literate than elders above 50 years!
The graphs below tabulated with statistics released by the Department of Census and Statistics presents the percentage breakdown of the CLR with respect to different age groups.

Figures released by the Department of Census and Statistics for the first half of 2017 confirm that the CLR in the island is rising as it has surpassed that of 2016. The figures released give the CLR in 2016 as 27.6 percent and the CLR in the first half of 2017 as 28.3 percent.
Definitions of Computer Literate Person (CLP) and Computer Literacy Rate (CLR)
As defined by the Department of Census and Statistics, a Computer Literate Person is‘a person aged between 5 and 69 years is considered as a computer literate person if he/she could use a computer on his/her own’. (As an example if a five year old child can play a computer game on his/her own, then he/she is considered computer literate). The Computer Literacy Rate (CLR) is‘the computer literate population (aged between 5 and 69) as a percentage within the respective domain’.
The Computer Literacy Rate in Sri Lanka has improved through the years (from 2004 to the first half of 2017)

Minister Harin Fernando also said that only people in the urban areas had access to computers initially, but after the last government introduced the ‘Nenasala’ programme, people in the rural areas were able to make use of a computer. More people will have access to a computer and internet once the ‘Tablet Project’ is launched. Under this project more than 200,000 A/L students will be provided with a tablet and internet connectivity next year (2018).
Under the same scheme, tablets will be provided to students from grade five to eleven with every three or four students having to share a tablet. In addition, under the Lanka Government Network (LGN) project 7,000 of the 14,000 Grama Sevaka Niladharis who were selected on a lottery basis will be provided with tablets within the coming weeks. “These projects would have got off the ground earlier if those who were not selected through the lottery hadn’t filed objections in court,” the minister added
According to Minister Fernando, the people were not able to make the best use of the facilities available at the Nenasalas because they were not conveniently located and also, being a community based program, those who were tasked to maintain them had lost interest.
He also said that the government had established 60 percent of the free Wi-Fi zones promised but under the ‘Tablet Project’ another 8,500 Wi-Fi zones will be set up in schools. Of the approximately 10,000 schools in Sri Lanka, 2,851 schools that have Advanced Level classes are to be provided with internet connectivity and three Wi-Fi zones each by April 2018. Each Wi-Fi zone would be covering a radius of over 300 meters.

People are using more smartphones and tablets than desktop computers
“People are using more smartphones and tablets to access the internet rather than desk top computers,” reiterated the Minister of Telecommunication and Digital Technology. The statement is affirmed by figures released by the Department of Census and Statistics showing that more and more people accessed the internet using mobile devices such as laptops, smartphones, tablets and mobiles rather than using the conventional desktop computer.
 Figures clearly show that although the urban population relied more on desktops and laptops to connect to the internet, the estate sector relied more on their smartphones and mobiles.
