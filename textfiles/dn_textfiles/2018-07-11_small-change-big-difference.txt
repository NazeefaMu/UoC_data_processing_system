Small change, big difference

Head Prefect of Stafford Anudi Bandara never gives up. And she does this not only for herself but for others as well. Her courage is not only for herself but for others as well. Perfect Prefects features Bandara who has begun her flight to success.
“Both my parents are in the field of Aviation, so it is something I am very passionate about and very interested in. In the future, I hope to pursue Aerospace engineering at the University. I think it is a very fascinating field. When we look at an aircraft we don’t see the processes behind it. There is so much beyond than what you actually see. I would love to learn about the mechanics. Being born into the field I have always had this passion and interest in it. Growing up, I knew that this is what I have always wanted to do. I have learnt as much as I can through the internet and documentaries but I want to pursue this to the point of getting a degree. I admire Amelia Earhart. She was the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean. There is a lot of gender discrimination in the aviation field and I don’t think that is fair at all. Certain women have been told that they are not suitable for this field and I do not think that is true. A woman or girl can do whatever she wants to do whether it is in aviation or another field because they have the capability to do it,” said Bandara.
Essential management
Time management, getting prepared, planning things ahead and having a backup plan together with her ‘Never Give Up’ attitude has allowed her to successfully perform the role of Head Prefect.
“There is a lot you need to balance as the Head Prefect. You need to balance your studies, your extra-curricular activities and your family life. You need to learn how to balance those very well. One thing I would like to tell everyone who is trying to succeed is to never give up.
There will always be difficulties that you have to face. You need to face them with courage. I believe anyone can accomplish anything that they set their mind to. There is no limitation or restriction to what you can do. It is my parents who taught me at a very young age, that you must continue to do what you want to do and never give up. So they have always guided me throughout my life and throughout my school career, to follow my dreams and never give up when I face a difficulty,” pointed out Bandara.
The Stafford motto is ‘Strive towards the light’ and her education at Stafford has instilled in her core values in addition to knowledge.
Conducive environment
“I have been at Stafford for 13 years and I am just about to graduate, so I can confidently say that Stafford is a very nice and conducive environment for a young person to grow up in. I remember that the Principal, teachers and sectional heads have been very supportive and have always catered to our needs. They have always listened to us and found a solution if something was amiss and have always nurtured us. Without a doubt they are very supportive, going out of their way to help us whenever they could. Our Principal is very kind and caring and always inquires about our wellbeing and she always tries to make this place a home away from home,” said Bandara.
The community is something she is concerned about and she quotes Mother Teresa - ‘We cannot all do great things but we can do small things with great love’.
“I would like to be a person that contributes to society and a good citizen of the country. I am very passionate about community service and volunteerism. It is something I participate in family and school. Recently I went on a trip to Bopagoda, where we donated items to a Pirivena that had been affected by the floods. Participating in those experiences gives you a lot of perspectives and it is something you do not see in everyday life. Helping people gives you a lot of happiness and you come to realize a lot of things through the act of giving,” explains Bandara.
Making a difference in the world can start by doing the right thing. Anyone of us can do this. Our actions can have an impact on society. We can make that difference. Your decisions can affect others in a positive or negative way.
Unfair discrimination
“There is a lot of discrimination in society these days. Every person born into this world is an equal, regardless of colour, ethnicity and nationality. We are all human beings. So discrimination is really unfair. So I would like to see all of that stop and to see everyone treated as an equal. You should care about your family, friends and people around you, and even if it is someone you do not know, you should care about the person and treat others the way you would like to be treated. Even a small change can make a big difference. If you can help a starving dog or beggar that will make a difference to that living being. When you look at the world and see people in poverty or people being bullied and beat up, it is not fair or right. They don’t deserve that. People need to stop hurting others and treat everyone nicely and fairly,” stated Bandara.
Parental love and care are so important for any child in this world. Our parents are the two most powerful people in our lives.
“A child needs the care of his/her parents. It is really unfair for any child to be separated from his/her own parents. They look to their parents for help and support and guidance. It is said that the way a child thinks, is influenced by what they see and what they hear. If they are separated from their parents, their guiding light, the consequences could be devastating. A child should have the opportunity to be raised by his/her parents and loved by his/her parents. If a child is separated, it is difficult to watch it happen. I value my family greatly because they have always been my support. My parents and grandparents have raised me so well, giving me all the guidance I needed,” explained Bandara.
