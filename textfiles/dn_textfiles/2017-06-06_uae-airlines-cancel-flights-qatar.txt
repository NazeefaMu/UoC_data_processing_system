UAE airlines cancel flights to Qatar

Emirates Airlines cancelled flights to Doha from today following similar announcements from flydubai, Etihad Airways, Air Arabia and Saudia Arabian Airlines.
In a shock move, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain turned against Qatar, saying it supports terrorism. It comes after three attackers killed seven people and injured 49 in a horrendous van-and-knife raid.
This follows an announcement from flydubai this morning as the airlines wrote on its Facebook page: “From Tuesday June 6, 2017 all flydubai flights between Dubai and Doha will be suspended”. The Maldives and Libya’s eastern-based government are also reportedly cutting ties to Qatar.
But Qatar say that the claims of helping terrorists are not true at all. Airlines have not said how long the flight ban go on for. www.dailystar.co.uk
