Chosen Comedy

You have seen it all right, already. That poster with a peculiar Sinhala wording, Balloth Ekka Be (which could be loosely translated into English as ‘It’s Impossible with the Dogs’), has been a familiar sight in Colombo streets with its cast staring right on to you. That peculiarity of the title has earned much wrath in the traditional Sri Lankan theatre.
Despite wrath and brickbats, the play will be heading to its 800th show on January 7 at the Lionel Wendt. Its director, Ravindra Ariyaratne, does not mind a touch of criticism. Survival is impossible, he notes, without criticism. However, there is a ‘but’ for him too.
“But the thing is criticism does not come from the audience. Our audience consists of intellectuals and scholars such as doctors and engineers. Some of them have watched the play quite a number of times,” Ariyaratne justifies his position.
The irony is yet to come: the criticism comes from those who have not seen the play.

“The reason is simple. Some of our fellow dramatists take pleasure in criticising plays of this nature. Let whatever come from whoever, but one thing is certain. We cannot take the audience for a ride. If the audience was unhappy, then we could not have come this far. Strange enough, we get to watch adaptations of Ray Cooney and Dario Fo. They are hailed as great plays. But when someone comes up with an original comedy, almost everyone in the field tends to look down at it. The adapted plays are recognised even at the state award ceremonies.”
As Ravindra Ariyaratne emphasises, Ballot Ekka Be is a comedy, but not the third-class category. You would not get to see silly jokes. The humour springs from two planes: characters hiding and overlooking the trivia. The situations are twisted to create humour.

At times Ariyaratne opts to go beyond the usual theatrics to create humour out of politics and the current political crisis. Ballot Ekka Be is also a comedy production with a commercial purpose. If the traditional rules cannot be violated, there is no use of art. From time to time, Ariyaratne’s team introduce fresh changes to the play. This comedy, which could also be called a political farce, has timely as well as universal themes. Ariyaratne identifies it as an example of free theatre, deeply rooted in folklore and its creative influence.
All that happens one day when a particular country holds an election to choose their next government. The politician, the main protagonist starred by Dayadewa Edirisinghe (earlier Vijaya Nandasiri), throws a grand party at his residence on the election night. But then, quite the unexpected comes to pass as the politician was losing the election big time. That makes him vulnerable to his opponents too. He decides to flee with his secretary.

But escape is not possible due to curfew declared. Walking on the road, they see a couple of statues. Left with no other option, they get into the statutes. And that’s where Ariyaratne’s comedy of errors takes off. While the politician and his secretary struggling silently inside the statues, a host of other characters come to the fore. A prostitute comes looking for her prey. A make-up artiste happens to stop over. A home-bound election duty officer walks into a tavern to sip a glass full of ambrosia before the day is over. And so on… for two hours.
“Any product and service should have a price. Theatre is no exception. Even in theatre, comedies earn more than serious plays because of the public attraction. However, in Sri Lanka theatre does not enjoy a fully privileged market as yet,” Ariyaratne observes.
Ariyaratne’s next attempt is Charita Horu Aran (Character Stolen), another peculiar title. He calls it a comedy of darkness based on surrealist themes. The lead character, a mayor, wakes up to forget who he is. Having forgotten everything, he walks by dreamily.

One thing the Colombans may never forget is the familiar face on the Ballot Ekka Be posters: Vijaya Nandasiri. He had been the lead actor of the play since its inception in 2009.
“We really miss Vijaya Nandasiri. He was the best actor we had for comedy. It is really difficult to find someone equipped with such a skill in dialogue delivery. It is such an amazing skill. He breathes a unique meaning to the dialogue. He takes his own time to deliver the lines. That time management is bravo! But even Maname had to continue without him. So we have to continue without him, sadly. His replacement, Dayadewa Edirisinghe, is a seasoned actor with years of experience on the stage,” Ariyaratne notes.
The playwright also observes that the audience behaviour matters very much in the theatre.

“Sadly, the schoolchildren do not know how to enjoy a drama. It is not their fault. They have not been taught that. During our school days, we did not have a separate subject for the theatre. But we were alert when a drama group was in town. We would go to the theatre well before they start their job. Even when the drama is over, we used to go offstage and ask them various questions. But now the schoolchildren have a hectic schedule with a syllabus burdened on them to pass the exams.”
Even the third ring of the bell would not stop the schoolchildren’s noise in the audience. In such situations, Ariyaratne takes a few minutes to teach the audience how to enjoy theatre in silence. Following that lecture, of course, the audience is silent.
Ballot Ekka Be and Charitha Horu Aran will be staged at the Lionel Wendt Theatre on January 7 and January 8 at 7 pm.
