Sampath Bank included to the MSCI Frontier Market 100 index

Sampath Bank has been included to the MSCI Frontier Market 100 index from May 2018. Sampath Bank (MSCI Code 1631601) is the only Sri Lankan company in the index with a weightage of 0.36%.
The MSCI Frontier Markets 100 Index is a representative and more easily alternative to its broader parent index, the MSCI Frontier Markets IMI. The MSCI Frontier Markets 100 Index includes approximately 100 of the largest and most liquid constituents of the parent index. To enhance tradability, the index methodology applies security filters to exclude securities with either low free float-adjusted market capitalization, a 12-month Annual Traded Value Ratio (ATVR) under 10% or low foreign room.
The index is reviewed semiannually in May and November with the objectives of reflecting changes in the underlying equity markets in a timely manner, while limiting undue index turnover. During index reviews, the number of constituents in the index is allowed to fluctuate between 85 and 115.
