Xianliang also predicted that Sri Lanka one day will become the merging shipping and trading centre in the region which is the Sri Lankan Government's blueprinted in the economic policy statement.
He made these remarks at the Sujata Jayawardena Memorial Oration, organised by the Alumni Association of the Colombo University. The Memorial Oration was conducted under the theme “One Belt One Road” Initiative and China -Sri Lanka Relation under the Initiative of “OBOR”.

Ambassador Yi Xianliang said up to now China has provided more than RMB 10 billion (over Rs. 200 billion) donations to Sri Lanka and granted nearly 12,000 trainee ships and scholarships to Sri Lankan youth.
“During the past 12 months of last year, we provided over 1000 scholarships and training opportunities to your youth for academic studies, language trainings and for professional training,”
Talking on the basic concept and thoughts in terms of “OBOR” initiative, he said the “Marine Time Silk Road” will one day make Sri Lanka an important hub between Dubai and Singapore.
The concept of “Maritime Silk Road” is in line with the development strategy of Sri Lanka, proposed by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
“Even during my visit to Indonesia in October 2013, our President Xi Jinping called for joint development of a “Maritime Silk Road of the 21st Century,”.
The “Maritime Silk Road” is part of the “OBOR” initiative and a major framework that China has made to deepen reform and opening-up and advance its neighbourhood diplomacy.
Nearly 2,000 years ago, people of Asia began to travel to Europe, Africa, the Middle East and coastal Asian countries through the sea lanes in the west Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean. “It gradually developed into a maritime trade route connecting countries across Asia, Europe and Africa,”.
He said the Maritime Silk Road has now become the symbol of peace, cooperation, mutual learning and resilience.“As you know the Maritime Silk Road of the 21st century has been anchored on economic cooperation and build on cultural and people-to-people exchanges,”.
The “Maritime Silk Road” initiative, by linking South Asia, Southeast Asia and West Asia will contribute to help the establishment and improvement of Asia's supply chain, industrial chain and value chain.
He said the “Maritime Silk Road” initiative features “five links” and all are aimed at bringing tangible benefits to the people in the region.“They are the 'Policy’ that countries can discuss strategies and policies on economic development, 'Road construction’, 'Trade Development’ between countries and the most important 'Currency'.
He said over 1600 years ago, a Chinese Buddist monk, Faxian came to Sri Lanka by land and went back to China on “Maritime Silk Road” and during the past 1000 years, people and goods exchanges between the two countries along the ancient “Maritime Silk Road”.
“More ships also stopped in Sri Lanka and went further to their east and west destinations,”.
He recalled even in the past the two countries’ worked together and constructed a lot of mega projects which benefited Sri Lankan development and created about 100,000 job opportunities for local people.
Talking about tourism, Yi Xianliang said more Chinese prefer Sri Lanka as their travel destination and Sri Lanka has become China's second largest tour destination.
He said China would like to push forward bilateral cooperation with Sri Lanka under the framework of “OBOR”, give consideration to each other's own national development strategy, while strengthening support for each other.At present, bilateral relations are on the track and we are willing to work together with Sri Lanka in the years to come.
