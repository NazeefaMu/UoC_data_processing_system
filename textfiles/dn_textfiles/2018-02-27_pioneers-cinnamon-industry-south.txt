PIONEERS OF CINNAMON INDUSTRY IN THE SOUTH

The owner of Dasanayaka Walawwa Plantations at Kosgoda and the late accountant under the British Colonial Administration, A. D. Sarojith and K. de Zoysa respectively were two of the pioneers of the cinnamon industry in Sri Lanka.
Those who were trained under the estate management of late Sarojith K. de Zoysa were also among those who took great pains to uplift cinnamon industry later on.
A. D. Vijith K. de Zoysa who carries the legacy of his ancestor is a fourth generation owner of Dasanayaka Walawwa Plantation and he dedicated his life to improve the quality of cinnamon products by introducing numerous innovations in every aspect of cinnamon growing, preparing cinnamon nurseries, planting and hygienic methods of preparing cinnamon products.
He hails from Kosgoda and has 37 years of experience compiled in a book which highlights every stage of the cinnamon industry.
In the past, traditional practice was peeling cinnamon bark on a gunny and this system is still in practice in certain rural areas of the country. But the system at present has been modernised and now at every stage of cinnamon production including peeling, is done on especially made tables in order to maintain the hygienic quality of the products.
In Sri Lanka, traditionally cinnamon has been identified to belong to five varieties such as ‘Pani Miris Kurundu’, ‘Panirasa Kurundu’, ‘Sewala Kurundu’, ‘Kahata Kurundu’ and ‘Thitta Kurundu’.
The credit of transforming and introducing this novel method goes to Vijith De Zoysa who had undertaken many years of painstaking research to get to this stage.
Compared to tea, coconut and rubber cultivators, cinnamon cultivators he said have not their work certified.
In 2005, the Dasanayaka Walawwa Cinnamon processing factory obtained GMP International Certificate for standardization in 2006 HACCP, an ISO standard in 2011 and FSSC 22000 in 2014.
He further said maintaining a cinnamon factory of similar nature as Dasanayaka Walawwa was very expensive but at the moment there were nearly 10 - 12 certified factories of International standard in the Southern province. Another issue was that the prices for cinnamon produced to international standard and the price of cinnamon products made on traditional gunny bag were the same.
Further, some workers employed in cinnamon factories, he said were reluctant to work in certified factories because the wages paid were also the same. Some of the factory owners due to these reasons have found it difficult to maintain their factories. So far the relevant authorities such as the Export Development Board have not taken effective measures to improve this condition.
The major cinnamon growing districts in the country are in Galle, Matara and Kalatura. In addition, Ambangoda, Karandeniya, Uragaha, Batapola, and Meetiyagoda in the Galle district are known to produce the best quality cinnamon.
According to the latest statistics, there are 10,644 hectares in the Galle district, 7,926 hectares in the Matara district, 2,313 hectares in the Hambantota district, and 2,633 hectares in Kalutara district which are under cinnamon cultivation.
Cinnamon in the past was always considered a cottage industry and less attention was paid to the improvement in quality and uniformity by those who are engaged in the cinnamon industry.
But now they want it to be finally recognised as a legitimate industry which needs the support of the government to continue to produce the world’s best cinnamon.
