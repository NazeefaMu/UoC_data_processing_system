Sri Lanka, India to set up solar unit soon

Sri Lanka will soon kick-start the setting up of a solar power plant in Trincomalee after discussions with India.
“The next step would be to undertake a feasibility study and do the groundwork,” spokesman for the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry Sulakshana Jayawardena told The Hindu on Wednesday. In April this year, the Sri Lankan and Indian Governments signed a Memorandum of Understanding, for cooperation in a host of development projects, including the setting up of a Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) plant in suburban Colombo and a solar power plant in Sampur, Trincomalee.
“We have a land to set up the 50 MW solar plant envisaged in the MoU.
We have to work out executing of the project, in consultation with India,” Jayawardena said.
Sri Lanka had initially planned to set up a coal power plant in Sampur, through an international joint venture with India’s National Thermal Power Corporation.
In September 2016, the Power Ministry scrapped the project citing environmental concerns.
A month later, Prime Minister Narendra Modi met President Maithripala Sirisena in Goa, on the side-lines of the BRICS summit, where he flagged the possibility of New Delhi partnering Colombo in LNG and green energy projects.
