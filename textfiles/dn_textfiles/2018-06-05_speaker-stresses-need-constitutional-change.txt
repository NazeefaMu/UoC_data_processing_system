Speaker stresses on the need for Constitutional change

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday stressed on the need to move ahead with changes to the constitution in order to ensure a sustainable peace and prevent armed conflict in future.
Addressing the International Steering Committee of the Global Partnership for the Prevention of Armed Conflict held at the Ramada, Colombo, on the ‘Importance of Prevention rather than Countering Armed Conflicts’, the Speaker asked for a “consultative ‘bottom-up’ process which would also involve changes to the constitution; establishment of permanent peace, empowered independent institutions; law reform; adopting good governance practices; and the nurturing of a society that respects individual rights, and acknowledges and appreciates the importance of resolving problems through means other than conflict – that is, through consensual approaches and democratic means, in a spirit; of tolerance, accommodation and compromise – are essential to ensure prevention and non-recurrence of conflict”.
He further explained that the National Unity Government after 2015, had taken a “victim-centric, consultative and ‘bottom-up’ approach to reconciliation and healing, with the clear objective of ensuring non-recurrence of conflict”, but the challenges along the way were many.
The current constitutional reform process, the Speaker said was a ‘bottom-up’ and all-inclusive process aspiring to address problems of the minorities, ensure the equitable and just sharing of power and resources among all people of Sri Lanka, and address discriminatory provisions in the existing constitution.
“It is hoped that a new constitution will address social inequalities and deliver on a promise of social justice. The Tamil National Alliance, the main Opposition Party in Parliament is an active participant in these processes. We have thus come a long way since the end of the conflict, and representatives of all communities are active stakeholders in shaping Sri Lanka’s future”.
The key however, he noted, was to have all take ‘individual ownership’ in preventing conflict,
“Parents, teachers, the media, religious leaders, business leaders, trade unionists, community leaders, politicians, and each and every individual human being have a role to play in ensuring the prevention of conflict at a micro and macro level. It is not something a Government alone can do at national level, through ‘top-down’ approaches, regulations, orders, strictures and censorship”.
To seek ways to ensure that each human being is driven by his or her conscience to care for others, to be concerned about others, to respect others and treat each and every one with dignity, and share a vision of a better class room, a better school, a better community, a better work place, a nation, and a better world where every human being is considered equal; and his or her individual rights are respected, valued and upheld; where development is sustainable and inclusive; and the rule of law is impartial, he said.
“We in Sri Lanka are still looking for answers observed the Speaker as he spoke of the importance of international organisations and other stakeholders look for ideas, and methods and tools that schools, communities, States, media organisations, as well as individual citizens can use to identify and respond to warning signs as a way to pre-empt the eruption of violence. “Learning from each other, and sharing best practices can be important in this regard”.
Ending on a positive note in Sri Lanka’s journey towards preventing conflict he highlighted the example of the JVP, a political party which was the protagonist in the 1971 and 1987 uprisings was now acting as “custodians of democratic values and institutions and watchdogs against corruption”.
“I believe the JVP stands as resounding proof of the transformative power of individuals and organisations when an opportunity is granted for this kind of change and reform”, the Speaker said.
