Horizon gets LLB Registered Center status from UOL in two years

Renowned for excellence in legal education, the University of London (UOL) as one of the largest and most respected institutions in the world, has had a long and distinguished history of working with top educational institutions around the world, who are selected through a stringent process, to deliver their LLB program.
UOL has in this manner, helped and guided many students towards quality institutions to attain a law degree of repute and global acceptance.
For the selection process of institutes they work with, UOL has introduced a framework through which it recognizes institutions that meet a set of specifications and benchmarks that emulate the high quality standards and criteria it expects. Depending on which set of criteria are met, an institution is then awarded either affiliate center or registered-center status through the framework known as the Institutions Policy Framework.
In order to be recognized as a registered center, an institutions standards in respect of teaching, support and administration has to be at a level acceptable to UOL, which normally takes an institute several years to attain before being eligible to apply for recognition.
It is against this background, that Horizon Campus became the only Government-approved non-state higher education institution in the country to gain the recognition of being awarded the status of Registered Center for the University of London LLB program in a short span of just two years
Outlining the aspects that led to Horizon Campus being awarded the Registered Center Status, Acting Vice Chancellor and Dean for International Programs at Horizon Campus Dr. Ruwan Perera said, "In order to be selected as a registered center of UOL, Horizon had to submit a self-evaluation document (SED), after which a review panel from UOL visited the campus to meet with staff and students and inspected the campus’s facilities."
"Horizon then undertook a range of quality assurance procedures, including annual monitoring and periodic review exercises in order to be awarded the registered center status."
By being a registered center, Horizon campus receives the highest level of support from UOL in a variety of areas that will in turn benefit students. These include access to a full range of up-to-date study material, appropriate on line and virtual-learning and marketing support.
