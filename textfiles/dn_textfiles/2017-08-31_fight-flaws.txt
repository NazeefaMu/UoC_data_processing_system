Fight the flaws

Breakouts are a nuisance to say the least, and discovering the best means of dealing with them is no easy feat. Spots, zits, pimples, whiteheads, blackheads, cysts, pustules, papules – call them what you like – are unsightly, irritating, painful and disruptive to self confidence. From putting toothpaste on our faces, to scraping and picking away at our skin many of us have tried some relatively unadvisable things in a bid to decrease the number of spots dotting our faces. Zero in on the zits with some acne-fighting tricks.
Best way to treat acne
Treatment for mild acne (whiteheads, blackheads, or pimples) may include gentle cleansing with warm water and a mild soap. Washing once or twice a day with a mild cleansing bar or liquid will keep the skin clean and minimize sensitivity and irritation.
Use exfoliating cleansers and masks. A variety of mild scrubs, exfoliants, and masks can be used. These products may contain salicylic acid in a concentration that makes it a very mild peeling agent. These products remove the outer layer of the skin and thus open pores.
A dermatologist can prescribe stronger medications or other therapies. Acne medications work by reducing oil production, speeding up skin cell turnover, fighting bacterial infection or reducing inflammation which helps prevent scarring.
The drug your doctor recommends depends on the type and severity of your acne. It might be something you apply to your skin (topical medication) or take by mouth (oral medication). Often, drugs are used in combination.

Applying acne cream
Acne cream should be distributed to the acne prone sites such as the forehead the nose the cheeks and the chin and should be applied evenly all over the face. Leaving too much in one area can cause to over dry the skin.
Prevent further acne breakouts
Keep your face clean - It’s important to wash your face twice daily to remove impurities, dead skin cells, and extra oil from your skin’s surface. Use warm, not hot, water and a mild facial cleanser. Using a harsh soap (like deodorant body soap) can hurt the already inflamed skin and cause more irritation.
Avoid harsh scrubbing - Wash your skin gently with a very soft cloth or your hands. Always rinse well, and then dry your face with a clean towel.
Moisturize - Many acne products contain ingredients that dry the skin, so always use a moisturizer that minimizes dryness and skin peeling. Look for “noncomedogenic” on the label, which means it should not cause acne. There are moisturizers made for oily, dry, or combination skin.
Try an over-the-counter acne product - These acne products don’t need a prescription. Most of them have ingredients such as benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, glycolic acid, or lactic acid, which curb bacteria and dry your skin. They may cause drying or peeling so start with a small amount at first. Then you can adjust how much you use and how often.
Use makeup sparingly - During a breakout, avoid wearing foundation, powder, or blush. If you do wear makeup, wash it off at the end of the day. If possible, choose oil-free cosmetics without added dyes and chemicals. Choose makeup that is labeled as “noncomedogenic”.
Watch what you put on your hair - Avoid using fragrances, oils, pomades, or gels on your hair. If they get on your face, they can block your skin’s pores and irritate your skin. Use a gentle shampoo and conditioner. Oily hair can add to the oil on your face, so wash your hair often, especially if you’re breaking out.
Keep your hands off your face - Avoid touching your face or propping your cheek or chin on your hands. Not only can you spread bacteria, you can also irritate the already inflamed facial skin. Never pick or pop pimples with your fingers, as it can lead to infection and scarring.
Stay out of the sun - The sun’s ultraviolet rays can increase inflammation and redness, and can cause post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (dark discoloration). Some acne medications may make your skin more sensitive to sunlight. Limit your time in the sun.
Feed your skin - Avoid greasy food and junk food and add more fresh fruits and vegetables and whole grains to your diet. Avoid dairy products and foods high in processed sugar which may trigger acne.
Exercise daily - Regular exercise is good for your whole body, including your skin. Avoid wearing clothing or using exercise equipment that rubs your skin and may cause irritation. Shower or bathe right after exercise.
Reduced stress - Stress can be linked with the severity of pimples or acne. It has been noted that there is an acne flare up when stress in on the rise.

Next wipe away the excess oil gently with the cloth, without rubbing and after 1-2 minutes, wash off your face with normal water.
l Use Vitamin E on Acne Scars. You could use vitamin E oil or Vitamin E capsules. First add steam to your face so that the pores open up and then take few drops of vitamin E oil. If you have bought vitamin E capsule, puncture it and extract the oil out of it and apply this oil to your skin having acne scars. Now massage the area with this oil in gentle circular strokes for about 10 minutes or till the oil is absorbed into the skin. Leave for about 15 to 20 minutes and wash it off.
