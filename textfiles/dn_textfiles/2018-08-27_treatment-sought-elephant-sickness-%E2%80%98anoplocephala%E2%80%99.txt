Treatment sought for elephant sickness ‘Anoplocephala’

A sickness identified as ‘Anoplocephala’ originating from a flea found in grasslands is spreading among tamed elephants in the country while no proper treatment has been found for it so far, Prof. Asoka Dangolla of the Peradeniya University’s Veterinary Faculty said.
The illness had spread among three elephants who participated in the Kandy Esala Pageant recently according to a research done by them. Medicine required to treat this disease is now being imported from India through the intervention of the Diyawadana Nilame Pradeep Nilanga Dela.
