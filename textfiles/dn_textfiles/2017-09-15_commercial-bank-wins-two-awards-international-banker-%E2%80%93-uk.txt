Commercial Bank wins two awards from International Banker – UK

The Commercial Bank of Ceylon won the awards for the ‘Best Commercial Bank of the Year’ and ‘Best Innovation in Retail Banking’ presented by the prestigious UK based quarterly publication ‘International Banker.’
This is the first time the Bank won two awards from ‘International Banker’ in the same year. Notably, the Bank won the ‘Best Commercial Bank of the Year’ in 2015, and was also awarded ‘The Best Private Bank of the Year’ in 2016 by the publication.
The International Banker award for the Best Commercial Bank of the Year recognises the strength of Commercial Bank as reflected in the Bank’s stellar financial performance, its contribution to the country’s Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) sector, the Bank’s contribution to the economy of Sri Lanka and how it has overcome the challenges in the market place.
The ‘Best Innovation in Retail Banking’ award was presented to the Bank in recognition of its innovative and technologically advanced features that enhance anytime-anywhere accessibility and convenience for customers as well as the innovative retail banking products launched by the Bank for different customer segments and sectors.
“These awards are a testament to our continuous commitment to excelling in all spheres of banking, and constantly challenging ourselves to look for better and more innovative ways to serve our customers each year,” said Jegan Durairatnam, Managing Director/CEO of Commercial Bank. “We value these awards because their emphasis is not size, but who does what best.”
The International Banker Banking Awards were established to recognise top-ranking individuals and organisations setting new benchmarks for performance and pushing the boundaries within the financial industry in terms of corporate governance, technological development and customer service that help to drive economic growth in the countries in which they operate.
The Awards were open to all banking institutions regardless of size, market capitalisation or number of employees. The sole concern of the awards is to highlight the best banks globally.
