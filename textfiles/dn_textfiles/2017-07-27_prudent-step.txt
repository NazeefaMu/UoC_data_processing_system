A prudent step

The Government has taken the prudent step in declaring Petroleum distribution an Essential Service from Midnight yesterday, in the face of the crippling strike launched by disruptive elements working to a political agenda. With the gazetting of the Essential Services order the security forces were deployed to facilitate the transport and distribution of fuel from Kolonnawa and Muthurajawela refineries to the dealers throughout the country.
As a responsible government the regime could not sit by and watch when normal life is torn asunder and the public are put into great hardship and peril. The wrath of the people naturally are directed at the government at such times, never mind the pros and cons of the issues involved and the first task of the government is to alleviate the suffering of the public and restore normalcy in civilian life.
It is patently clear that the strikers are being backed to the hilt by political elements seeking a shortcut to power they lost at the ballot by provoking the anger of the public against the government. In this bid they do not care a whit for the hardship and ordeals endured by the public. It is also obvious that the Petroleum strike, as well as the frequent GMOA work stoppages, are sustained with massive financial backing off the ill gotten earnings of the former VVIPs and with the government’s delay to seek out and trace the accumulated loot these strikes are bound to escalate and heap more hardships on the public. Hence the need for a concerted effort by the government to pursue in earnest the corruption investigations that are now stalled or are in abeyance so that the current malaise could be traced to their source.
Now that it has shown it means business, the government should not hesitate to similarly deal firmly with other work stoppages and disruptions caused to public life and demonstrate to the public that there is governance in the country.
The reality for the JO
Transport Minister and SLFP stalwart Nimal Siripala De Silva could not have put it better when he remarked that attempts (by the JO) to topple the government was only a pipe dream, going on to quote chapter and verse from the relevant section from the 19th amendment to the constitution in this regard, as reported in our front page on Tuesday. According to the Minister, the JO will have to wait for another full three years to entertain any hopes of effecting a regime change. One option was to hope that the President would, indeed, have a change of heart and decides to accommodate the JO in forming a SLFP led government.
Assuming that this is so, it will be a long wait, in fact a full two and a half years, by virtue of the restriction imposed by the 19th amendment on the President to dissolve parliament until after four and half years into its term. On the other hand the Joint Opposition will need to muster a two thirds majority in the present parliament in order to circumvent this requirement and topple the government on its own. Presently, it has just 51 members in parliament in the 225 member legislature and will need another 100 MPs to reach the coveted figure, which, to quote the Minister, is a pipe dream. Even if the claim that 18 members from the mainstream SLFP are to break ranks and join their lot it will be a Hymalian task, to put it mildly, for the JO to reach the target.
With the Provincial Council elections now being put off and no national level election in the horizon it is difficult to imagine any member of the government(from the SLFP) throwing in their lot with the JO or sitting as Independents in parliament. Perhaps, the rumour of a possible crossover was being floated by members of the JO to coincide with the impending PC elections with the hope that this would attract the so called disgruntled elements within the SLFP. In any event, should there be crossovers at this juncture the prospects would indeed be bleak for those joining the other side. For one thing, they would be compelled to vegetate for two and half years sans all perks and privileges. For another, they would not be forgiven by the SLFP voters for sitting with the ‘enemy’ in parliament, thus killing their chances of re-election from whichever party the JO decides to contest. There is also the very real possibility, that, in the event they decide to sit as Independents in parliament, of disciplinary action being taken against them by the SLFP, leading to their ouster from parliament.
Another two and half years down the road is a long time in politics and it is difficult to contemplate what configurations the present political scenario would take at the end of this period. It is also possible that the stature of Mahinda Rajapaksa would be largely diminished given that investigations into mega corruption of the Rajapaksas could begin any time soon in dead earnest.
