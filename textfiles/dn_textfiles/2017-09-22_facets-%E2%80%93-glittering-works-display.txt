FACETS – glittering works on display

The 27th edition of the FACETS International Gem and Jewellery Exhibition was held at the Sirimavo Bandaranaike Memorial Exhibition Centre recently.
President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe and international delegates from all over the world visited the exhibition.
The Premier Jewellery Pavilion and the Gem and Jewelry Mart returned once again to much acclaim from the show’s visitors. Stunning sapphires, dazzling diamonds, exquisite emeralds and radiant rubies were but a few of the types of gems among the glittering assemble, ranging from precious to semi-precious, garnets, aquamarines, spinels, amethysts, jade, amber, jasper and lapis lazuli were also some of the stones that made up the lists of features. Some of the jewellery on display was composed of metals such as gold, silver and platinum whilst others were made of coral, wood and glass. This year’s exhibition also featured a number of stalls showcasing laboratory equipment, artists’ tools and machines used in the manufacturing of jewellery and the mining of gems. Throughout the past 27 years FACETS has slowly but surely grown in size and popularity. What was once a simple jewellery show is now one of the most well known exhibitions in the global Gem and Jewellery community.
