Lady lawyer awarded nearly Rs 1 mn in landmark labour case

A.S.Damayanthi, Attorney-at-Law and ex-legal officer of one of the leading listed companies based in Nawinna, filed an action in the Labour Tribunal, Pannipitiya, against her former company in a labour law suit.
Attorney-at-Law A.S.Damayanthi filed an action against the respondent company for wrongful termination of employment and obtained an order from the tribunal which determined that her termination has been wrongful and was awarded sum of Rs 900,000 after having worked at the said comapny for four-and-a-half years.
It was revealed in the judgment that the question that had to be determined by the tribunal was whether the applicant was wrongfully terminated due to attending some notarial work outside the scope of her employment.
Ian Fernando, Senior Counsel with Sumudu Rathnayake appeared for the applicant, A.S. Damayanthi. The company was represented by Indra Laduhetti, Senior Counsel. The Learned Labour Tribunal President, in his 33-page judgment, set out as follows: He quoted the judgment that was set out in the case of Adams vs. Derby City Council (1986)1 ILR at page 63 which said 'If the employer can’t prove any reason for the dismissal, the dismissal is automatically unfair'.
In the said case, the applicant, attorney-at law A.S.Damayanthi had been charge-sheeted at the domestic inquiry wherein she was held guilty of not attending a Board meeting and for having executed certain notarial documents not belonging to the respondent company.
It was stated in the applicant’s letter of appointment that no other legal work can be undertaken which directly or indirectly will affect the respondent company during her contract of employment.
Although she was found guilty at the domestic inquiry, Learned President of the Labour Tribunal having given his mind to the domestic inquiry order and held that the applicant A.S Damayanthi had been wrongful terminated.
The termination was admitted by the respondent company and therefore the said company including the chief legal officer Jayalatha Sriweera with five other witnesses gave evidence in favour of the company stating that the termination of the applicant was justifiable.
lan Fernando, counsel for the applicant, vociferously cross-examined the chief legal officer who was questioned whether certain other lawyers in the said organization had done notarial work during their tenure of office and documents such as deeds and land registry extracts were obtained to show same. These lawyers had done notarial work outside the scope of employment which did not hinder the progress of the respondent company.
The Learned President of the Labour Tribunal observed that the contract of employment signed by the applicant and the respondent company has been termed as an unilateral agreement in favour of the respondent company. He said the said agreement was one-sided.
It was also observed that certain restraining clauses of employment can be put on a letter of appointment solely when the commercial objective of the respondent company and its trade secrets are at stake.
However if the applicant employee had during his spare time indulged in work which does not hamper seriously or damage primarily the employers' business, it will not be termed that the employee is guilty of breaking the conditions set out in employment stated in her letter of employment.
It was also observed by the tribunal's president that Samanthika Gallage, attorney-at-law who worked for the respondent company also had done notarial practice during her employment.
Therefore in consequence of Article 14 (01) G (read with Article 12), every person needs to be treated equally as set out in the Constitution in Sri Lanka Articles 4(d), 17, 126 and 3rd chapter Articles from 10 to 17 show administrative actions if violated, the Supreme Court has a right to entertain such application and take into account the decision by the learned president of labour tribunal who has observed that the applicant has the right to do her notarial practice which would not hamper the company directly or indirectly.
Therefore the application made by the lawyer in the labour tribunal for wrongful dismissal from employment was substantiated and she succeeded in her application that the termination was wrongful.
