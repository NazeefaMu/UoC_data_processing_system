War inscription exhibition

The thirty year Civil War in Sri Lanka claimed the lives of almost 24,000 military personnel. However though these lives have been lost, the literature they leave behind give us an insight as to how they spent their last days and their thoughts.
Their ghostly inscriptions and poems have been engraved on their helmets, trees, bunkers, and in destroyed buildings. Just before they died, these were the thoughts that entered their minds – about their wives, parents, friends who died and their children.
“These writings can be termed as War Literature and is common in regions throughout the world that are in a state of military conflict or where the conflict has ended. Such inscriptions were seen in the Vietnam War and World War II. These are very emotional and thought provoking,” said Veteran Journalist, Director of Documentaries, Charith Kiriella.
An exhibition will be held on June 30 at Malay Street Defense Services College at 9.30am exhibiting these inscriptions collected from earlier war torn areas. It will be opened by Commander of the Army, Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake.
A Press Conference was held at Rock House Army Camp Modera auditorium last Wednesday to reaveal this event. Brand Ambassador for ARYA Foundation, Roshan Mahanama and Former Army Commander Shantha Kottegoda attended the event.
This exhibition will be held to enlighten the public about these war heroes who have served our country sacrificing their lives which is the ultimate sacrifice. However as Kiriella pointed out, even though so many soldiers have lost their lives in the Sri Lankan Civil War, there is very little literature about them and very little movies.
“We have visited these regions and documented these inscriptions. We have collected them in Mullaitivu, Kilinochchi, Vavuniya and Jaffna over time. So we are planning to have an exhibition where these inscriptions can be viewed by the public. This exhibition is called ‘Bunker Kurutu Gee Exhibition” held for the first time in Sri Lanka,” said Kiriella.
“I wrote a book called 90 Kokavil. It is going around the world. Now it is being launched in Melbourne on May 10. My book documents how Sri Lankan Troops defended the Kokavil Rupavahini Communication tower. They came under a severe LTTE attack. But courageous Captain Aladeniya and his troops did not give in, stayed back offering resistance and finally laid down their lives,” Kiriella added.
