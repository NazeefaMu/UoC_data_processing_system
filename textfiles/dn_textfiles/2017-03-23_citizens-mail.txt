Citizens' Mail

 No regulatory bodies for Ayurvedic doctors and other healers?
The GMOA, student movements, politicians, trade unions, interested individuals and groups are currently hitting the headlines with their hysterics and the mass media are also obsessed with reporting SAITM’s inability to meet the requirements (still not gazetted) of the regulatory body for Allopathic medicine sector, namely Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC). Their demonstrations on the public roads have created mayhem paralysing the country’s economic activity and demoralizing the poor, helpless patients. Their actions have wasted large amounts of valuable foreign-exchange spent on tear-gas cans, water cannons and the precious time of the police and the public.
The public are well aware that the quality of the service rendered by the healing sector (or the industry!) which looks after the lives and well being of the people cannot be compromised. The moot question is, where are the regulatory bodies for healing sectors such as Ayurveda, Homeopathy, Acupuncture and the plethora of quacks comprising ‘Gamey Wedahs’, Kattadiyas, miracle healers- religious and otherwise, who even advertise their healing powers using the mass media? What action have these egoistic groups taken to safeguard the lives of the public from the aforesaid healers?
In this context, it is evident that the SAITM issue has been blown out of proportion by the aforesaid groups to achieve their ulterior motives.
Any sane person should understand that this whole issue involves a Sri Lankan investor and a group of local, enterprising young students who have braved several obstacles to serve the nation by succeeding in medical profession. Therefore, they should be encouraged to sort out the drawbacks or shortcomings rather than engaging in disruptive, militant activities to prevent a feasible solution benefitting the country and its people.
