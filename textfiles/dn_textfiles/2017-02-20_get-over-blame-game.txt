Get over the blame game

The current text must be scrutinized, analyzed, understood and realized in the context of the initial understanding components of the Part One, published in Daily News on February 15, 2017. Not doing so may lead to misunderstanding and misinterpreting the contents, even to the extent of falling in to the extreme of branding the present writer, an anti-Buddhist. This will be even more so, with the proponents of the vested interest of extremism and religious fundamentalism, since, the actual and ultimate objective of the current analysis is the intelligent and fruitful guarding of the Sinhala Buddhist and the Buddhism as well. That is what the extremists do not want.
Besides, what is suggested is to intelligently protect the Sinhala Buddhist and the Doctrine of the Buddha, in the spirit peace and friendship, without blaming and attacking the Muslims. Hence, any attack on or negative and shallow branding of the current writer, shall be tantamount to, advocating the promotion of extremism and fundamentalism in this beautiful country. Read further and know the truth.
Peace-loving and friendly Muslims
Muslims are a friendly community. Their religion Islam promotes peace. Their community friendship and religious peace are inseverably linked. It, in fact, is the personal experience of the current writer, from the times of his university education abroad, since, the Faculty of International Law he studied, along with other community-graduates, was a pool of Islamic Muslims, stemmed virtually from almost all Middle-East countries. They, not only were pious, but also had the wish and potential to be open, transparent and flexible.
This is not to say that every day is springtime with Muslims. There are crises. The crises are exploding, not from the peace-loving and friendship-rooted Muslim majority, but from a handful, due to ignorance or not knowing, engaged in the extremism of non-original Islamic fundamentalism. Non-original, since, Islam is a peace and friendship fostering religion.
The psychology of extremism does not allow the peace-loving Muslims to live in friendship with other communities. In their extremism, they use the artificially created, Islamic fundamentalism and abuse the freedom of the majority Muslim community, to bend their minds to create a fundamentalist Islamic caliphate in this beautiful country. Herein, they also exploit the device of the fear of God, the reward of God to those, who obey them and the curse of God to those, who disobey them.
The majority peace-admiring Muslims have been rendered choiceless, in defending themselves, against this so-called religious quagmire. On the top of all the above mechanism, what is further nourished with by extremism is, the concepts of betrayer and betrayal. This is why, the Muslim majority is silent. Their opposition to extremism is not discernibly vocal. Now, the BBS has a duty.
Community duty
Hence, it is the responsibility of the peace-loving Sinhala-Buddhist community to save their Muslim brothers and sisters, their beautiful children, from the extremism of fundamentalism. Yet, the lamentational blamology is not the right path. And, this is what the Bodu Bala Sena must comprehend. It seems that the BBS agenda demands couple of crucial measures, for it to be self-revolutionized. The BBS action plan must not be strangled in to stagnation. It has to contain a sweet fragrance, in order to maintain its magnetism, to retain its freshness and it should evolve like life itself.
It is indisputable that the extremism of religious fundamentalism should be fought with. Nevertheless, in this battle, the majority Muslim participation is a sine qua non. With their empirical and voluntary involvement, the war against extremism will be not only easy, but also result-oriented. Result-oriented, not only internally, but also internationally. Besides, the global circumstances have become favourable to battle against fundamentalism. Particularly, the governance of US, with its new and courageous leadership, with Donald Trump at its head, has absorbed an orientation, heard never before.
The majority of powerful countries with Arabic origin have come to the forefront, taking the lead to oppose the extremism. These historico-developmental phases, matured unto their qualitative peaks are not to be belittled or under-estimated, yet, to be intelligently assimilated and applied in the resolution of crises Sri Lanka is conflicting with, be they communal, religious or otherwise. Dear Dilanthe, the BBS agenda has to change, transform and transcend.
Blame classification
The present writer intends to indicate only central blame categories, though the blame type numbers continue to increase day by day. Among them are: (1) Demographic blames, (2) Religious blames, (3) Terrorism blame (4) The blame of brutal religious laws, (5) The blame of dress-code, (6) The Sinhala Buddhist identity distortion blame, (7) Archeological remains destruction blame and many more. Nevertheless, herein, the emphasis to be focused upon has been decided to be the demographic blame.
There are some Sinhala Buddhists, who clamour that Muslims increase their population and try to capture the land that originally belonged to Hela Diva.
It is true that there was a time, there were no Muslims in Sri Lanka. Then, at a certain point of time, along with their intermittent migration, Muslims began to immigrate in to this country. First they visited as tourists. Then they came as traders. At that time our kings and Buddhist monks not only had no objection, they welcomed those Muslims, gifting their Sinhala Buddhist women to marry and produce children. Muslims not only produced children, but also converted the Sinhala Buddhist women in to Islam. Thus, this is not a new thing and Sinhala Buddhists themselves are responsible for this. It is true that the number of Muslim heads have increased unto such proportions that a Muslim could become the Chairman of the Colombo Municipal Council and simultaneously, they have also become a powerful political factor with the potential to change governing regimes. Here blaming Muslims is useless. They are right in what they do, as far as, their power, welfare and prosperity are concerned. Muslim woman
Just look at the wonderful Muslim women. They are perfect in the right understanding of their social duty. When a Muslim woman walks along the road, what can be noticed are as follows: 1. Well-dressed, covering their feminine body and concealing the attraction-curves of contours, 2. Three or four children accompany them, 3. She does not look at others and head is bent downwards, 4. Her arms hold one child, 5. Her womb contains another child. What a wondrous and powerful scene to be seen!
Sinhala woman
Now, let’s glance at the Sinhala-Buddhist woman. The total opposite: 1. Scantily attired, exhibiting certain body parts in half or in full 2. Physical contours are well pressed and manifest, 3. The head is not bent downwards, 4. For the most part no children or maximum two children 5. The womb is flat.
Right here, the Bodu Bala Sena has a tremendous duty. That is, to advise and admonish those, who blame Muslims, for their population-increase-efficiency and to explain the futility of such efforts. The blame and blaming would not stop the Muslim population increase. The other way round, it will engender a Sinhala Buddhist Phobia and the concentration would be on the maximum growth of the Muslim population.
BBS duty
Hence, the BBS has a gigantic duty. That is to take all steps to power the minds of Sinhala Buddhist men and women, with a psychological propensity to increase the production of children, who are the real foundation of power and prosperity of any nation. In the execution of this colossal task, at first, the BBs has to analyze and apprehend the impediments and barriers, which impedes its way. Fundamentally, the obstacles are two types: (1) Social (2) Religious.
Social barrier-NGOs
The social barriers comprise the non-governmental organisations(NGOs), funded by foreign agencies of vested interest, propagating and promoting the ideology of family planning, branding the planned family of childlessness, as a so-called “Golden Family” and as the basis of economic prosperity.
The hired employees of such NGOs, go from house to house, meet the community family members and explain the value of planning the child births and if conceived, the need of aborting or in truth, killing the conceived children, yet, innocent and unborn and living in the wombs of Sinhala Buddhist and Tamil mothers. They not only coax them in to this totally anti-Buddhist brutality, but also grant them monetary gifts and various financial supports, to win their hearts in to the heinous crime. Yet, their so-called “Golden Family”, having been successfully operative for more than four decades, has utterly failed to produce any economic prosperity whatsoever, except for raw slaughtering of our Sinhala-Buddhist and Tamil innocent children.
Here, the Muslim women are not and cannot be trapped in, since, they are courageous enough, not to be befooled in to the sin of destroying their real community power, the children. Therefore, the BBS can structure an empirically operative schedule, to get rid of such child chopping NGOs from this majestic land of the Buddha, whose first precept along the path of purification is “Thou Shall not Kill”.
Religious barrier-meditation on repulsion
The religious impediments that contradict the Sinhala-Buddhist population growth vary and consist of different aspects of Buddhist Teaching. Among them, the Doctrine of Nirvana, Impermanence, Suffering, Non-self, Renunciation, Celibacy and many others. Yet, the present writer’s intension is to limit himself unto the meditation on the repulsion of the body or ”Pilikul Bhavana” alone. The Body Repulsion Meditation is not only an excellent, but also an indisputable teaching of absolute truth. Yet, it is applicable only in relation to those, gone from home to homelessness. The lay man cannot dwell in it. Why? It elucidates: (1) The body is a bundle of flesh, (2) It is indisposed, gets soiled and reaches the decrepitude, ending in death, (3) When it dies, it becomes blue, gets swollen and will be full of stinking blood and yellow pus, (4) The worms would form and roll round in it, being disgusting to look at.
Now, if and when, young men and women are indoctrinated in to this ideology, what will happen? In the beautiful physical body of any girl of youthfulness, a young boy, with oozing out energies would visualize a bundle of stinking flesh, contaminated with oozing out pus and blemished with rolling round abhorrent worms. Who will produce children? Who can produce children? With no children, can there be Buddhists? Without Buddhists can the Buddhism last?
Hence, the first and the foremost duty of BBS is to comprehend the gravity of this burning issue and do all the needful to remove the barriers, which intervene, obstruct and prevent the growth of Sinhala Buddhist population, along with establishing a fund to financially assist the poor families, which produce more than two children.
Though there are many other aspects to be looked into, that, the increase of the number of the heads of Sinhala Buddhists is the most reliable path to castrate the tentacles of extremism and religious fundamentalism. Is it not much profit-generating than attacking Muslims?
