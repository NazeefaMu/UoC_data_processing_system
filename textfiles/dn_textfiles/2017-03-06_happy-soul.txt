Happy soul

She is the kind of girl you will feel comfortable enough to walk up to in a room full of strangers and chat. She has that ‘nice girl’ vibe about her and this is reflected in the characters she portrays as well.
Though she comes from a family which is very much rooted in the acting scene, Thisuri Yuwanika took time coming into the limelight. However once fame and fortune claimed her, they had a hard time letting her go.
“Though I am very dedicated to whatever project I take up, I look forward to taking a break once shooting concludes. I am not someone who likes to work night and day nonstop, pursuing project after project. I value a stress-free lifestyle. Though I do not take up so many projects or make frequent appearances on screen, I believe that this did not have much of an impact on my fame,” Thisuri opined.
She is awaiting the release of her movie ‘Darma Yuddaya’. She had concluded shooting for Suneth Malinga Lokuhewa’s ‘Nidahase Piya,’ a movie based in D S Senanayake’s life. A few of her teledramas are also slotted to begin telecasting soon.
Q: Since you come from a family which is into acting was it predestined that you will become an actress?
A: I was not that keen on acting during my childhood. However since my mother, Susantha Chandramali, is a well known actress, acting was not an alien subject for me.
I remember that my mother was not at home most of the time. She had to go to the locations to take part in shooting. I did not like that much. However I got the opportunity to act because of her. I did a few children’s roles in her projects but studies were my priority. Therefore I managed to do well in both my G C E O/Ls and G C E A/Ls. I won a Presidential Award of Merit for the role I played in ‘Udugam Yamaya’ when I was studying in grade five. All this and the feedback I got from the fans boosted my interest towards the field. The path has already been prepared for me. I just need to try my luck at it.
Q: Do you have any limitations when you take on roles?
A: Yes and no. (Laughs) An actress needs to take on any kind of role that is handed over to her... BUT I do have some limitations that I have imposed on myself. I am careful about the clothes I wear because we live in a culture conscious society. I need to act in a manner so that I would be able to go out in public with my parents without any embarrassment.
I need to consider the steps I take now because I should be able to face my children without shame in the future. Though I have imposed such rules on myself I believe that such things did not have any effect on my career. I still get plenty of offers in quality productions.
Q: What was the most difficult scene you had to portray?
A: No scene was too difficult so far, but I was a bit hesitant to play romantic scenes at the beginning of my career. (Laughs) I guess that was because romance was something quite new to me. That was quite embarrassing to engage in those scenes in front of the crew. However once I got the hang of it after acting in several productions, I got over my difficulties and loosened up.
I think the role I had to work really hard was for Rukmal Nirosh’s ‘Sulanga Mata Mohothak’.
I portrayed two different roles: a 21 year old campus student as well as mother of a six year old in it. Since there was a huge time gap between the transitions of the role I wondered whether I would be able to carry it off with ease… (Flashing a huge smile) I did it! I managed to do justice to Charulatha’s role. That was quite memorable simply because it was such a challenging role for me.
Q: What is your greatest strength and what is your greatest weakness?
A: My parents are my greatest strength. Without their support and advice I could not have conquered such heights.
They are also my greatest weakness because I cannot do anything without them.
Q: What is your first childhood memory?
A: Believe it or not I have quite a lot of clear memories from my childhood. I was a very naught child especially because my mother never punished me. One day I had gone to play with my friend next door without informing my mother. When my mother was frantically searching for me she had seen me climbing their roof by clinging onto the roof tiles. That had frightened her a lot. That was one of the few times I took a beating. (Giggles)
Q: What makes you super happy?
A: Anything and everything! (Laughs) I am a happy soul. I love to make the best of the moment. I do not fret over facts like I do not have this or that. I am happy with what I have achieved.
Q: If you could star in a biopic, whose role would you like to play?
A: I do not have anyone particular in mind. I would take on any character in a project if I feel that I can do justice to the role.
Q: What was the worst rumour you have heard about yourself?
A: (Laughs) Thankfully there have not been bad rumours about me in any of the papers, TV or websites so far…. (Pauses and then goes on in a more serious tone) There was a selfie we took during a scene in the sets of ‘Diyaniyo.’ Someone has posted it on the web stating that it was taken at the funeral of one of our colleagues who passed away after an accident. The person who had posted it had reproached up saying that artistes are heartless and uploaded that picture as an example. Later some others have clarified that statement claiming that the picture was taken on the sets of ‘Diyaniyo’ but the incident left a bad taste in everyone’s mouth. I felt very angry as well as disgusted that such foolish people exist and they stoop to such a low level to make such attacks on us.
Q: If you could change one thing about yourself what would you like to change?
A: I get angry a bit too easily for even minor matters. I would like to control my temper.
Q: What is the best acting advice you have gotten and who gave it?
A: Every word of wisdom I have gotten is from my parents. They have been the guiding light of my future. If someone tells me something gently and lovingly I listen to them. It does not matter to me if they are a veteran in the field or new to the scene.
Q: If you could have anything in the world as a snack right now, what would you choose to have?
A: (Laughs) Goodness… I eat everything. I do not stop to think whether I would develop pimples or put on a few kilos. So bring anything you please and I will devour it… (More laughter)
Q: If you could not become an actress, what would you have been?
A: I have not really thought about doing a career. Maybe I would have simply stayed at home. I do not like to trouble myself too much with work. I work with dedication whenever I take on a project but I have never been a workaholic. I value my free time.
Q: Isn’t it about time you tied the knot?
A: (Shyly) I do have someone in my life now. However we do not have plans to tie the knot anytime soon.
Q: Would you ever take part in a celebrity reality competition or beauty pageant?
A: No. Those things are not for me. My field is acting. However I do admire my fellow artistes who do well at such competitions. They inspire me but I do not aspire to take part in such projects. Taking part in beauty competitions has never appealed to me. They use a lot of chemicals on your hair when they style it and I am scared that something will happen to my tresses. It has always been my wish to dress as a bride for the first time for my wedding.
Q: 10 years from now how do you see yourself?
A: I see a lot of changes in my life then. I would be married and with children. However one thing is for sure.
I would have ventured forward as an actress.
