Appeal for financial assistance

G. Rohana Seneviratne (41), a resident of Kumbukewa, Kekirawa, who is now bedridden after a spinal cord injury, has appealed for public assistance to help maintain his family.
He injured his spine when he fell off a highrise building while working as a labourer at a construction site, a year ago.
He says his family manages to live with the assistance rendered by people in the neighbourhood. He has two school-going children aged 16 and 13. He also finds it difficult to travel from Kekirawa to Matale for medical treatment.
His wife has to attend to his daily needs, like washing and feeding, in addition to her household chores. Their house is only half finished, with two tiny rooms built with the help of neighbours. They would be grateful for any public assistance extended to assist them to make a living and complete their house. Financial contributions should be remitted to account number 042-200157507596 at the People’s Bank, Kekirawa branch. Rohana could be contacted on 0766 422792.
