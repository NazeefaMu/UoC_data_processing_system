SAITM students being used by trade unionists, parents allege

SAITM students are being used by a health sector trade unionist connected to NGOs for his personal gain, SAITM Medical Students' Parents' Association Chairman Gemunu Wijeratne said.
“We will reveal his identity soon,” Wijeratne said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA headquarters in Colombo yesterday evening, he said that this person took the pants off the government during the recent LG polls and SAITM parents will remove his pants soon.
SAITM is a BOI project and the government cannot take it over. Dr. Neville Fernando is the only owner of SAITM.
The people of Sri Lanka have clearly told the government that private medical education cannot exist in Sri Lanka. They did it by defeating the government during the recent LG polls, he said
The Secretary of the Parents’ Union of State Medical Students, Gamini Ekanayake said that all court cases existing against state medical students should be withdrawn by the government immediately because the students struggled for the country and to protect free medical education and not for themselves. They did not rob the Central Bank to be jailed.
