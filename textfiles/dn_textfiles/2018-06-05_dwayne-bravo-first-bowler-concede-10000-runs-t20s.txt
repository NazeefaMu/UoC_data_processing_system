Dwayne Bravo first bowler to concede 10,000+ runs in T20s

Dwayne Bravo has been one of the most sought-after players in the T20 format. The Trinidadian has plied his trade for various franchises in tournaments around the world. He has played for as many as 19 teams in his illustrious career. The 34-year old has quite a few records under his belt. Bravo is second on the list of most matches played by a cricketer (391) in the shortest version.
However, with 427 wickets under his belt, the Windies all-rounder is the leading wicket-taker in T20s. Subsequently, he has turned out to be a standout performer for whichever team he went on to represent. His T20 career started way back in 2006 and is still going great guns. Bravo recently completed his stint for the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in the prestigious Indian Premier League (IPL).
CSK released him prior to the auction of this season’s event but brought him back using the Right to Match (RTM) card. Albeit Bravo picked up 14 wickets in 16 matches, he had his difficult times in the league. His slower deliveries became too predictable and consequently, he leaked quite a bit of runs.
He was once taken apart by Andre Russell and Harshal Patel which landed his team in dire straits.
He is among CSK’s most expensive bowlers with an economy of 9.96. In the event, he conceded 533 runs and became the first ever bowler to conceded 10,000 runs in T20s.
Bravo is currently standing at 10,287 runs in 1254.2 overs at an economy of 8.20. The all-rounder hasn’t played for his national team since the Windies’ T20I series versus Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) back in September 2016.
Bravo is not getting any younger and with the emergence of youngsters, he has to refurbish his skills in order to prolong his career.
His next assignment is expected to be in August when he will take the field for the Trinbago Knight Riders (TKR) in the Caribbean Premier League (CPL). - crictracker
