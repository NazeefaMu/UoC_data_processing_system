‘We reached historic milestones’

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe sending a congratulatory message to the President of the People's Republic of China Xi Jinping on his re-election for a second term as the General-Secretary of the Communist Party of China and Chairman of the Military Commission at the recently held 19th National Congress, reiterated the strengthening of bonds between the two countries.
The Premier stated: "The longstanding friendship between Sri Lanka and China built upon mutual respect, solidarity, trust and understanding has led, over the decades, to both countries reaching new and historic milestones in our time-tested bilateral partnership. It is my fervent belief that the close affinity and collaboration will continue to further flourish and expand for the benefit of the peoples of our two countries during your second term of office.
"Please accept, Excellency, my best wishes for your health, happiness and personal well-being and for the continued progress and prosperity of the friendly people of the People's Republic of China."
