Five of the best Test matches ever played

It is said that the Test cricket is the most difficult form of cricket. A victory in Test cricket victory is savored much more than any victory in limited overs cricket. For any cricket, the longest format of the game is held in the highest esteem as that is the format in which one's technique, grit, and composure are tested. Wearing the whites of one's country remains the ultimate dream for any cricketer.
Here, we discuss some of the greatest test matches ever played across the world. While there have been plenty of incredible test matches over the years but great care was taken to list five best matches which took in some thrilling performances and nail-biting finishes. The five games which made this list are as follows:
1. INDIA BEAT AUSTRALIA BY 171 RUNS – KOLKATA, 2001
Score- Australia- 445 & 212; India -171 & 657/7
The second test in Kolkata of Australia’s series against India in 2001 was Test cricket at its best and one of the greatest test matches of all time. It is ranked higher due to its surprising result at the end. In Kolkata, the contest was between two good teams. It was the third case in Test match history that the side following on had won.
Australia batted first and hit 445 with a brilliant 110 by Steve Waugh which lifted Australia from 256 for 8 to 445. For India, it was Harbhajan who took 7 for 123 in 37.5 overs and became the first bowler in the 69 years of Indian Test cricket to achieve a hat-trick. Australia looked well set for their 17th consecutive test win when they dismissed India for a relatively low total of 171 in the first innings.
In the follow-on, India replied 115 for 3 before VVS Laxman came to bat. He scored one of the greatest knocks of all time with a brilliant 281 run and shared a superb stand of 376 with Rahul Dravid. India declared the innings at 657 for 7. Chasing the target of 384, Australia were dismissed for 212 with off-spinner Harbhajan Singh taking six for 73.

2. ENGLAND BEAT AUSTRALIA BY 18 RUNS – HEADINGLY, 1981
Score- Australia 401 & 111; England 174 & 356
As per many cricket experts, this is the greatest test match of all time. The series is simply dubbed as ‘Ian Botham’s Ashes’. This was just the second time in Test match history that the side following on had won. At the point when Ian Botham landed to bat in England’s second innings, they were five wickets down and still 122 runs behind.
England lost their next two wickets in quick successions and it looked all over for them. Only then came an awesome inning from Ian Botham (149 not out from 148 balls with 27 fours and a six), aided by a fine fifty from Graham Dilley. The pair put a rapid 117 run partnership for the 8th wicket. Chasing the target of 130, Australia was cruising at 56 for one. Then an astonishing spell of 8-43 by Bob Willis shattered the Australian innings for 111.

3. SOUTH AFRICA LOST TO ENGLAND ON THE VERY LAST BALL OF THE MATCH – DURBAN, 1948
Score- South Africa 161 & 219; England 253 & 128
Chasing a target of 128 from 28 overs, England was 126 for 8 at the end of 27.5 overs. With three balls left any one of four results remained possible. Alec Bedser was on strike with Cliff Gladwin at the non-striker's end. Bedser leveled the score with a single and changed the end. Gladwin missed the second ball.
Afterward, in a deep conversation, he and Bedser decided to race in any outcome except the wicket being hit. As the bowler commenced his run-up, all the South African fielders ran towards the wicket to prevent the single which would win the match. Gladwin swung his bat, but again missed his stroke and the ball struck his thigh and bounced a yard or two in front of him. Before the fielder from the short leg picked the ball, both the batsmen changed their end. A drama came to an end.

4. WEST INDIES BEAT AUSTRALIA BY ONE WICKET, BARBADOS, 1998-99
Score- Australia 490 & 146; West Indies 329 & 311
Brian Lara’s unbeaten 153 against Australia in Bridgetown is generally and legitimately viewed as the best innings in a run chase of Test cricket. Australia scored 490 in the first innings with the assistance of a splendid 199 innings by Steve Waugh. Chasing the target West Indies were 98 for 6 before a 7th wicket partnership of 153 between Sherwin Campbell and Ridley Jacobs took West Indies into a formidable position.
The next day, West Indies continued their dominance by bowling the Australians out for 146, leaving a target of 308 for victory. When three wickets lost, it appeared the cause was lost for the West Indians. West Indies’ position kept on deteriorating on Day Five till they were 105 for 5. Now Lara made his move, he produced one of the greatest knocks to overcome the mighty Australians. Finally, West Indies Won by 1 wicket as Wisden put it, “he had guided his team to victory as though leading the infirm through a maze”. It was only the fourth time West Indies had scored more than 300 to win a Test match. Steve Waugh himself described it as one of the Greatest Test Matches he had ever played in.

5. SRI LANKA BEAT ENGLAND ON THE SECOND LAST BALL OF THE MATCH – LEEDS, 2014
Score- Sri Lanka 257 & 457; England 365 & 249
After facing 122 deliveries for the 10th wicket, it was the second last ball from Eranga which prevailed over all the efforts that both Ali and Anderson brought out to save the match and gave Sri Lanka a memorable Test series victory. Anderson faced 55 balls over 81 minutes without scoring a single run and tried his best to save the match.
Moeen Ali scored a century in the second innings and got full backing from other English batsmen. At the point when the ninth wicket was down, it simply seemed like a formality for Anderson and Ali to play as many balls as they could. The match ended with a high profile drama and at last Sri Lanka won the match with just one ball left. – sportsk
