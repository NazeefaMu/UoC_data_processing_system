JKH records Rs 2.91 bn PBT in 1Q

John Keells Holdings PLC Group revenue was at Rs.30.16 billion for the first quarter of 2018 which saw an increase of 12 per cent over the Rs.26.82 billion recorded in the previous financial year.
The Group profit before tax (PBT) at Rs.2.91 billion in the first quarter of the financial year 2018/19 is a decrease of 29 per cent over the Rs.4.09 billion recorded in the previous financial year said Chairman, Susantha Ratnayake.
The transportation industry group PBT of Rs.842 million in the first quarter of 2018/19 is an increase of 4 per cent over the first quarter of the previous financial year.
The increase in profitability is mainly attributable to the performance of the Group’s Bunkering, and Ports and Shipping businesses.
The Leisure industry group PBT at negative Rs.278 million in the first quarter of 2018/19 is a decrease over the first quarter of the previous financial year. Whilst the City Hotels sector recorded an improvement in average room rates, profitability was impacted by a decline in occupancies, primarily as a result of the increase in room inventory within Colombo in the calendar year 2017.
The Property industry group PBT of Rs.9 million in the first quarter of 2018/19 is a decrease over the first quarter of the previous financial year. The decrease in profitability is mainly attributable to Rajawella Holdings Limited, which is currently undergoing a relaying of the fairways.
The construction of Cinnamon Life is progressing with encouraging momentum, with approximately 62 per cent of the floor area sold in the two residential towers. Tender submissions for the Tri-Zen residential development project are expected to be received in the ensuing quarter, whilst presales continue to be encouraging. In addition, the master planning of an 18-acre suburban site North of Colombo is also currently underway.
The Consumer Foods industry group PBT of Rs.339 million in the first quarter of 2018/19 is a decrease of 46 per cent over the first quarter of the previous financial year. The decline in profitability is on account of the Beverages business which recorded a volume decline of 37 per cent. This is due to the implementation of a sugar tax from November 2017.
The retail industry group PBT of Rs.235 million in the first quarter of 2018/19 is a decrease of 51 per cent over the first quarter of the previous financial year.
The Financial Services industry group PBT of Rs.550 million in the first quarter of 2018/19 is an increase of 131 per cent over the first quarter of the previous financial year. The increase in profitability was primarily due to Union Assurance PLC, driven by a growth of 13 per cent in gross written premiums. Other, including the Information Technology and Plantation Services sectors recorded a PBT of Rs.1.21 billion in the first quarter of 2018/19 which is a decrease of 28 per cent over the first quarter of the previous financial year.
