The case for books

Several small studies suggest that reading on paper instead of an electronic screen is better for memory retention and focus. The Guardian reported on an experiment from Norway where people were given a short story to read either on a Kindle or in a paperback book; when they were quizzed later, those who read the paperback were more likely to remember plot points in the right order.
“When you read on paper you can sense with your fingers a pile of pages on the left growing, and shrinking on the right,” the lead researcher, Anne Mangen, of Norway’s Stavanger University, told the Guardian. “You have the tactile sense of progress ... Perhaps this somehow aids the reader, providing more fixity and solidity to the reader’s sense of unfolding and progress of the text, and hence the story.”
Paper suits readers with sleep problems and eye strain High levels of screen luminance from an electronic device can contribute to visual fatigue, a condition marked by tired, itching, burning eyes.
There are also potential considerations for those reading e-books on light-emitting e-readers at night (although a number of e-readers do not use light-emitting screens), says Dr. Margaret K. Merga, a reading and education expert. “Artificial light exposure from light-emitting e-readers may interfere with users ability to sleep, ultimately leading to adverse impacts on health.”
A 2014 study published in the journal PNAS found that reading an e-book before bedtime decreased the production of melatonin, a hormone that preps the body for sleep. E-books also impaired alertness the following day.
The human touch
Many book-lovers still prefer the traditional option and value the tactile sensation of a bound paper book. “Paper books are, as a rule, very well designed, they look and smell good, and they carry with them a more human touch.” say the experts.
