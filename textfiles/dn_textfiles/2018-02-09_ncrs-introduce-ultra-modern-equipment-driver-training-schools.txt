NCRS to introduce ultra modern equipment for Driver Training Schools

The National Council for Road Safety (NCRS), has made arrangements to introduce ultra-modern equipment and training tools to the Drivers’ Training Schools countrywide within this year. Accordingly, owners of registered Drivers’ Training Schools would be provided with easy loan facilities to purchase the necessary driver training instruments for their training schools to create efficient and quality drivers in the future within Sri Lanka and globally. Recently, a discussion with a team of experts from Japan was held to look for ways and means of implementing such a programme to generate quality Sri Lankan drivers who would assist in reducing the alarming rate of road accidents in Sri Lanka.
According to latest records, the Council had found that about 08 persons die daily in Sri Lanka due to road accidents on and about 20 persons being disabled due to road accidents daily. From January 1, to December, 31, 2017, about 2,910 fatal road accidents have taken place in Sri Lanka and from these accidents, about 3,078 persons had died on roads. Among them, there were 935 pedestrians, 998 motor cyclists, 239 drivers, 423 passengers and 289 push bicycle riders.
To educate school children, about 2,350 demonstrations had been shown on how accidents could be prevented and further demonstrations would be held at school level during the next six months countrywide with the help of the Traffic Polic, said W.M. Balasooriya, Kurunegala District senior Director of Education, speaking at a meeting of school heads of the Kurunegala District held on Wednesday (7) at the Wariyapola Teachers’ Resources Centre.
