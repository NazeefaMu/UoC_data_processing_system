CEB launches islandwide strike

 
Ceylone Electricity Board (CEB) workers launched an islandwide strike today in protest of some workers being assaulted during the strike yesterday.
The protest launched by clerical and allied services staff at CEB headquarters had turned violent when the CEB Chairman was held hostage by the protesters following a tense situation.
The Special Task Force was thus deployed to rescue the Chairman, leading to clashes between the two groups.
