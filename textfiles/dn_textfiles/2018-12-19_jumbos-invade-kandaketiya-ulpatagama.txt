Jumbos invade Kandaketiya, Ulpatagama

A herd of wild elephants had destroyed crops of the villagers in Kandaketiya, Ulpatagama and suburbs yesterday morning.
The herd has invaded villages from the Randenigala reserve forest through Uma Oya of Wasanagama. The jumbos had destroyed cultivations of plantains and maize.
The wild elephants invade the villages through Uma Oya in the night and stay in the reserve. They storm the villagers at dawn, villagers say.
They say their children cannot attend schools and they cannot walk outside in the night because of the wild elephants.
