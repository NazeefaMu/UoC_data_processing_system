Breaking into India’s fortress - Mission Impossible?

India is one of two countries that Sri Lanka has yet to win a Test match (the other is Australia), and the task of them performing it this month seems like “mission impossible” considering the strengths and weaknesses of the two sides.
India are currently on a role beating all and sundry being ranked number one in Tests and two in ODIs. They have not been beaten in a Test series at home since 2012 and the chances of Sri Lanka even pulling of a victory in the three Tests seems a far-fetched task at this stage.
It was only as far back as August that India came to Sri Lanka and whitewashed us 3-0 in our own conditions and pitches. Since then Sri Lanka has gained some of their composure by beating Pakistan 2-0 in the UAE, inflicting on the hosts their first-ever series defeat at that venue since 2010.
What Sri Lanka will carry to India is the confidence gained from that victory which should give them a morale boost ahead of the Test series and at least wipe out some of the scars of their 3-0 whitewash at home.
Surely Sri Lanka must have learnt their lessons from their three Test losses where they erred and what needs to be done to rectify their mistakes so that they can look India in the eye and meet fire with fire when the new series starts at Kolkata on November 16.
Alastair Cook’s England is the last team to beat India in a Test series in India in 2012 when they won the four-match series 2-1 (1 drawn). Since then India have been unbeatable at home winning series against Australia (2), West Indies, South Africa, New Zealand and England.
Two areas that stood out in England’s victory was their fielding which was miles ahead of India and the batting of their captain Alastair Cook who showed his team mates that run-scoring was possible in India with some hard graft.
Although Nick Compton’s first tour was not prolific, he and Cook ensured the middle order was not regularly exposed early. England accepted that a run-rate of three-an-over would often be the summit of their ambitions, but knew the value of keeping India in the field for hours on end. If Dimuth Karunaratne – the leading run getter for Sri Lanka against Pakistan can play the role like Cook, Sri Lanka can be halfway towards achieving that elusive Test win.
Coaches often talk about the fielders taking a wicket and in this area England were excellent. It was reward for the hours of training done between Tests and before play as they affected three crucial run outs during the series that of Virender Sehwag, Cheteshwar Pujara and MS Dhoni that proved to be game changers.
Sri Lanka’s fielding which was dreadful at one time has shown a remarkable improvement under coach Nic Pothas and the rest of the support staff. What the fielders still lack is the ability to make direct hits a habit. If that can be done Sri Lanka can take a heavy load off the shoulders of their champion bowler Rangana Herath who is approaching the sunset years of his career and who recently admitted that it would one of his dreams to win a Test match in India.
But unlike against Pakistan where Herath holds a stranglehold on their batsmen with 106 wickets (avg. 28.07) from 21 Tests and a strike rate of 62.1 balls per wicket, he has not found similar success against Indian batsmen who have been able to productively tackle his left-arm spin. Herath’s strike rate against India is 82.8 balls per wicket. He has 32 wickets from 9 Tests at 45.96 which is the most expensive against any country that he has played.
How hard Sri Lanka’s task will be is that since that 2012 home series defeat to England, India has lost only one Test match at home in 22 matches winning 19 and drawing 2.
That rare defeat came as recently as February this year when Steve Smith’s Australians pulled off a surprise win by 333 runs in the first Test of a four-match series at Pune, but suffered the full wrath of the hosts in the remaining three Tests to lose the series 2-1.
Few gave England hope after defeat in the first Test of that series in Ahmedabad, but a few weeks later they left the shores of India with a famous series victory. Nothing is impossible in this game of uncertainties.
