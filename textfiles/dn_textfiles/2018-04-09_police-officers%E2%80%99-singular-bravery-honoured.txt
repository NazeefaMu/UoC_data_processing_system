Police officers’ singular bravery honoured

A special ceremony to honour acts of valour of police officers was held on Saturday with the participation of IGP Pujith Jayasundara.
Police officers who risked their lives to net drug lord Makandure Madush's drug ring on May 9, 2017, were awarded prizes.
The police had conducted this raid after the Narcotics Bureau filed a secret report in the Maligakanda court and the raid was conducted with the help of Sinnaiah Suresh. Police Constable Abeywickrama (49446) died during the raid and Constable Constable Kumara (67055) succumbed to his injuries sustained in a shootout, following a betrayal by the main informant to the police. The IGP presented Rs 1.2 million to Abeywickrama’s wife and Rs. one million to the kin of Constable Kumara.
The actions of the Sergeant Jayawardene (1176), who prevented entry to the LTTE vehicle from which a bomb was detonated at the main gate of the Temple of the Tooth in Kandy, was commended by the IGP. The officer who was body-checking the women entering the premises at the time, had identified the LTTE gunmen running directly towards the temple and had locked the main entrance gate preventing the gunmen from entering the premises.
The bomb was detonated at the main gate and thus destruction to the sacred Tooth Relic was averted. IGP Jayasundara commended this act of bravery which happened 20 years ago with a cash prize of Rs. 500,000, a special prize and a salary increment.
