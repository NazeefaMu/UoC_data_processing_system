Esmeralda is a fictional character in Victor Hugo's much acclaimed novel 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' (or Notre Dame de Paris) which was translated into several other languages across the Europe. Esmeralda was a young gipsy girl who possessed a seductive beauty with a kind and a generous heart.
She is the centre of the attention within the story. Her creator Victor Hugo was revered as a towering figure in literature and was a statesman who shaped the democracy in France. Hugo's advocacy to abolish the death penalty was renowned internationally. This story of the battle of a hunchback is based on the time 500 years ago in Paris well before the French revolution, although the specific period is not all that relevant.
The story depicts the life and experiences of this poor dancing girl, a gipsy, as was known to the society, in a period where the human values were vague, and determined at the whims and fancies of the royalty, rich elite and the powerful clergy. The destiny of the powerless and the poor were at the mercy of a ruling class with unbridled power. Esmerelda constantly attracted men with her seductive dances. She captured heart of many men. However she was unaware of the thoughts of the influential and powerful people who were desperate to possess her. Among those were the high priests of the Notre-Dame Cathedral and
his adopted son Quasimodo, a hunchback by birth and the bell ringer of the same church. The high priest Claude Frollo ordered Quasimodo to kidnap her. But Esmeralda was rescued by Captain Phoebus with whom she instantly fell in love to the point of obsession.
Later she found that Captain Phoebus had no plans to take her hand in marriage as she hoped, but to use her for his own pleasure. Esmerelda's whole life from the beginning to the end was full of tragedies that befell on her mainly due to her beauty and the innocence and the deep rooted injustice prevailing in the society towards the powerless. This great classic by Victor Hugo was adapted into Sinhala as 'Kudaage Sangraamaya' by the prominent writer late H P Siriwardhane around 65 years ago. It was republished as 'Notradamaya' in 1972 by Lake House Investment Ltd. H P Siriwardhane was no stranger to the then literary circles. His short story collection 'Maaraya Andhuda' published around 70s became an instant bestseller.
H P Siriwardhane passed away in 2008 at the age of 92 in Melbourne, Australia. Keeping with the promise made to Siriwardhane, the writer Nihal Sarathchandra Akmeemana has brought an edited version of 'Kudaage Sangraamaya' with a new title 'Aadara Esmeralda' into the literary world for the benefit of Sinhala readers. In his preface to this new edition, Nihal points out the significance of the role played by the Gipsy girl Esmeralda from the outset to the end of the narrative, though the hunchback Quasimodo was considered as the main protagonist in the original book.
The new edition is adorned by a preface titled 'A Man Apart' by Dr. Edwin Ariyadasa and cover page pictorials by Dhammika de Silva. It was published with the courtesy of Niroshana Jayasundera of Stamford Lake (pvt) Ltd.
Nihal Sarathchandra Akmeemana is an old boy of Issipathana and Ananda Colleges. He lives away from our motherland in New Zealand for over two decades. His first literary work was written during his childhood, a novel 'Mara Paashaya'( Death trap) which was published years later in 1972 by Rathnakara Publishers.
After several years of silence, he published a collection of short stories 'Ekthara Katu Satahanak' (Just a Sketch) in 2004. We shall truly admire his efforts for publishing this revised version of the adaptation of this great story for the benefit of Sinhala literary enthusiasts in this isle.
