Bitter but better!

Bitter Gourd also known as 'Karawila' (Momordica charantia) belonging to the Cucurbitaceae family, is a popular vegetable in Sri Lanka especially because of its medicinal value. It is good for those who have diabetes. It is also good for your overall health. Garden Talk features Development officer, Provincial Deputy Director's office of Agriculture Ratmalana P.A.G.C. Siriwardhana who spoke about this nutritious vegetable.
"It is a little bitter when consuming, but the bitterness can be reduced, by the way it is cooked. In that sense it can be a tasty meal. It can be grown in regions up to 1200m above sea level. The soil must be rich in organic manure with a good drainage system. PH of the soil must be 5.5 - 7.5," said Siriwardhana.
There are varieties of Bitter Gourd -
* MC 43
* Thinnaveli White
"Karawila is a vine. After around three weeks the vine needs to be trained. For this a 2m Mesh is used. The Karawila vine is attached to this mesh. So it grows vertically along the Mesh. After that, the vine spreads over the roof of the mesh horizontally, after reaching a height of 2m. Of course the secondary branches must be removed (they are unproductive). Since the vine needs to be maintained at a certain height the mesh is 2m. (The Mesh acts as a support to the Vine)
When growing in a home garden we use a 2m branch to support the vine. The vine is attached to the branch. And it grows along the branch vertically. However even in a home garden a mesh can be used. After reaching a height of 2m, the vine hangs down, without further support," stated Siriwardhana
There has to be a good drainage system and it has to be irrigated according to soil moisture content. If there is too much heat or too much rainfall, when growing commercially, then it is best to opt for the nursery before planting in the field (direct seedlings). Because of too much heat or rainfall the seedlings get damaged.
Protection
"Also the plant has to be protected against insect attacks. The melon fly (Bactrocera cucurbitae)
The pod must be covered by a polythene wrapping. The fly, at the larvae stage is in the soil. Then when it becomes an adult it lays eggs in the pod. The larvae in the pod starts to eat from within. Then the pod falls to the ground/ to the soil. Then the life cycle begins again. So when the pod is covered, the fly cannot lay its eggs. However when covering with a polythene the polythene needs to be opened from below - So the air can come in. So the polythene wrapping must be longer than the pod. The covering must be applied at the early stage of the pod.
If there are pods that have fallen to the ground, they need to be removed immediately and destroyed. This is because the larvae in those pods can cause problems. The life cycle needs to be broken.
There are more methods that can be used to fight the fly. We can use a protein bait. The scent draws the fly to its destruction. The bait has a poison and it is sprayed to the leaves. There is yet another way and that is the hormone trap," explained Siriwardhana.
Then there is the fungi and virus threat. When it comes to fungus problems the leaves become diseased and should be removed and burnt. There is the mosaic virus - the plant weakens and yellow patches emerge and growth is retarded. Then automatically there is a low yield. Then the plant must be uprooted and destroyed. On a commercial basis we need to apply chemicals.
Reaping the harvest
"We must also identify when to reap the harvest. There are ridges in the pod and we can be sure the time is right when the ridges expand in size. When the pod matures you can reap the harvest. We know the pod has matured when the ridges widen and thicken. Through experience it can be determined. The color also may change. Size could get elongated," pointed out Siriwardhana
When growing Bitter Gourd in your home garden, you have two alternatives.
"You can directly plant in in the garden (direct seedling) or you can plant it in a polythene bag (the bag must contain organic manure and top soil). When you plant the seeds in the polythene bag and when the seedling emerges, you can strip off the polythene and place the soil mound containing the seedlings in the hole in the garden. Before transplanting the soil mound, the hole in your garden should contain organic manure and top soil. The height and width of the hole should be 1ft. When planting the seeds in the Polythene bag it takes one week to two weeks for the seedling to appear.
We can also use direct seedlings. (When you plant the seeds straight away in the hole). What is done there is the hole is prepared and three seeds are planted. When the seedlings emerge we keep two seedlings and remove one. We keep the two best seedlings and remove the other one. Because the hole is not sufficient for three seedlings," added Siriwardhana
Even commercially like in Home Gardens direct seedlings are used - that is planting them directly in the fields.
"But when conditions are not favorable the seedlings are prepared in the nursery. However when conditions are favorable people go for direct seedlings- planting them directly in the field. In the field, the hole should contain organic manure and top soil. Commercially the spacing should be 1.5m x 1m. (This is not necessary when growing in home gardens). Again three seeds are planted, the best two seedlings are kept and the other one is removed.
In around 60 - 75 days the pods appear," pointed out Siriwardhana.
These Karawila plants can be grown in Dry Zone and Wet Zone. However in the Dry Zone it is grown according to the seasons - Maha and Yala. During Maha season - it is grown during October and November and in the Yala season - April and May.
