English media revel in World Cup success

LONDON Saturday: English media heaped praise on Gareth Southgate’s team for reaching the World Cup semi-finals and told the country to cancel plans for Wednesday evening when they face Croatia seeking a place in the final.
“Wednesday’s cancelled! Fans go wild as Three Lions reach first World Cup semi-final for 28 years,” said the Sun on Sunday after England beat Sweden 2-0 in the Russian city of Samara. The Mail On Sunday online edition said: “The Dream Goes On! England in ecstasy.”
It praised the emerging star of the England team, goalkeeper Jordan Pickford, for more “heroic saves”, and said 32 million people had watched on TV.
