Creative possibilities of prosthetics

As the founder of The Alternative Limb Project, designer Sophie de Oliveira Barata uses her special effects expertise to create state-of-the-art prosthetics. Blending form with function and blurring the line between art and technology, this ambitious endeavour aims to creatively improve the lives of those in need of limb replacement.
To create these alternative limbs, de Oliveira Barata works closely with each client in order to get a sense of his or her style. Once she has an aesthetic in mind, she begins designing the limb, employing the help of 3D modeling specialists, electronics experts, and, sometimes, the client's prosthetist. The result? “Imaginative limb covers that delight the eye, empower the wearer, and inspire a positive dialogue about the human body and difference.”
In addition to these highly stylized and avant-garde artificial limbs, de Oliveira Barata also designs and creates realistic prosthetics. Unlike the alternative pieces, these hand-sculpted models are intended to meticulously match the wearer's other body parts. In either case, though, de Oliveira Barata views each artificial limb as a means of self-expression and, ultimately, as a physical “extension of the wearer’s personality.”
