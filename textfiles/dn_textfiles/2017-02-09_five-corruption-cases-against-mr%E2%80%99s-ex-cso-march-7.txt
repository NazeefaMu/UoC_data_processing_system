Five corruption cases against MR’s Ex-CSO on March 7

Five corruption cases filed against Major Nevil Wanniarachchi, the ex-Chief Security Officer (CSO) of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa were yesterday fixed for counter objections by Colombo Additional Magistrate Aruni Artigala.
The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed five corruption cases in the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court against Major Nevil Wanniarachchi over non-declaration of assets and liabilities.
The Bribery Commission alleged that Major Wanniarachchi had failed to declare his assets and liabilities for a period of five years since 2010 to 2014 while serving as an Army Major.
The accused had filed objections against the charge sheets and the prosecution was directed to file counter objections before March 7.
The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed charges against the former Minister in the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court under Section 9 of the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law No.1 of 1975.
