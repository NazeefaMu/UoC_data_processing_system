Lake House, YMBA join hands to host Vesak Festival

Several programmes are to be arranged by Lakehouse in collaboration with the Colombo Young Men's Buddhist Association on behalf of the National Vesak Festival.
An essay competition will be focused as the main activity, as organizers have opened up for all students from schools as well as “Damma schools.’’
The age categories are divided into three and they are from Grade 4-6, Grade 7-9 and Grade 10-13 and the winners will be rewarded with cash prices.
