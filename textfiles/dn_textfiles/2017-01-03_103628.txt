Developemnt Should Take Priority Political Struggles: President

President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday requested that political power struggles be set aside to work together to develop the nation. He said this as he launched his vision for the Sustainable Era initiative for Sri Lanka 2030 at the Presidential Secretariat.
“The country does not need those who were ousted from power to stage comebacks or for others to retain their political power. What we need is for all to come together to work  towards developing the country,” the President said. He stressed that the immediate priorities in addition to economic and social development was reconciliation.
“It is easier to build a country when people trust each other,” he said. The President called for commitment from all parties and stakeholders to abide by their duty and work to develop the nation.
The vision for the Sustainable Era initiative aims at building Sri Lanka’s own Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in line with the UN SDGs, Sri Lanka signed up for in September 2015.
