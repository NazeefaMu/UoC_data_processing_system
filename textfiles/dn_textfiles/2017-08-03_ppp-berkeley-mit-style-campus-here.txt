PPP for Berkeley, MIT style campus here

The setting up of a university of international standards in Sri Lanka with the assistance of the private sector and reputed universities such as Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and University of Berkeley, California, received cabinet approval yesterday.
The University is to focus on engineering and business to build a workforce suited to the competitive global economy, the cabinet proposal made by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe stated.
 The University would be set up through under a public-private partnership through a not for profit limited company.This company will implement the necessary procedures required for it and build partnerships with the foreign universities for its programmes.
