Katchatheevu retrieval is of no use: Pon Radhakrishnan

Lashing out at the political parties demanding the retrieval of Katchatheevu from Sri Lanka, Union Minister of State for road transport, highways and shipping, Pon Radhakrishnan, asserted that retrieving the islet will not solve the Indian fishermen issue. Those parties that put forth such a demand were only imagining things and showed that they lacked understanding on the subject, he charged.
“There are several issues revolving around Katchatheevu, ceded to Lanka in 1974 by India, The BJP government was never involved in it. In fact, the Jan Sangh had then opposed ceding of India's territory to Lanka,” Mr Radhakrishnan said. Speaking to reporters he said on Thursday, “It is sheer imagination of certain political parties that retrieving Katchatheevu will resolve the fishermen's problems. They lack knowledge on the subject.”
The issue, he argued, was not confined to the islet alone. One has to look beyond for a meaningful solution to the frequent killing of the Indian fishermen. “If you think the retrieval will solve the problem.
Then you are wrong,” he said and added this particular issue could be discussed when the need and such a situation arose. Recalling External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj's role in ensuring negotiations between Indian and Sri Lankan fishermen and the representatives of Sri Lankan government and Tamil Nadu, Mr. Radhakrishnan said despite her health condition, Ms Sushma undertook the visit to Colombo in good faith of resolving the crisis. She had to undergo kidney transplant later on. Nowhere will you find such a minister who is dedicated to the people's cause,” he added.
Union Minister of State for road transport, highways and shipping, Pon Radhakrishnan has claimed that extremist elements have infiltrated into the fishermen agitation in Rameswaram and contended that their increasing presence in the state will not augur well for the future of Tamil Nadu.
"I had warned of their infiltration during the jallikattu protest (on the sands of Marina in Chennai). Once again they have infiltrated donning a different avatar. If all the political parties understand the threat, those parties and democracy will stand to gain or else this will lead to regret later," he warned on Thursday. The infiltration of the extremist elements under various occasions, the Minister told reporters in Madurai airport, will not augur well for the entire state.
On January 25, Mr. Radhakrishnan, while alleging that "extremist forces" had infiltrated the pro-jallikattu protests and that they had "used" the youngsters, sought to know how police could allow unwanted elements to sneak in amid the students. "Why did you allow a python or cobra to sneak into a students' protest?" Mr. Radhakrishnan had asked then.
Asked about the opposition to the hydrocarbon project, the Minister said certain parties were opposing the project in Neduvasal with the attitude, "Even if I lose one eye, it doesn't matter; my enemy should lose both the eyes". "But, on the other hand, we are thinking of everyone's welfare. Those political parties are playing nasty politics.
They themselves will create a situation of facing the worst consequences wherein it will be difficult for politicians to step out," Mr. Radhakrishnan said and added their opposition to the project is against democracy and the well-being of Tamil Nadu .- DECCAN CHRONICLE
