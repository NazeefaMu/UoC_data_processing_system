Fresh indictment on Aluthgamage

A fresh indictment was yesterday served on former Sports Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage.
This is for allegedly purchasing a house worth Rs.27 million at Kynsey Road, Colombo 7 following a complaint that he had allegedly purchased properties through illegally acquired money.
When MP Aluthgamage appeared before Colombo High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga, he was ordered to be released on a cash bail of Rs.200,000 with two sureties of Rs.500,000 each.
The High Court Judge further issued an order directing the police post to obtain the fingerprint marks of Aluthgamage in order to ascertain any previous criminal records.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against Mahindananda Aluthgamage alleging that Aluthgamage had purchased a house at Kynsey Road, Colombo 7 from an individual named Christopher Roshan for Rs.27 million.
The Attorney General alleged that the accused has failed to disclose how he was able to raise the money for the purchase of the house and further alleged that he had committed an offence that comes under section 3 and 4 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.
The former Minister stands accused of financial irregularities in a complaint lodged against him by the convener of the Voice Against Corruption Wasantha Samarasinghe. This case is to be taken up again on July 10.
