Open Day and Home Economics Workshop

The Open Day of the Colombo Academy of Hospitality Management (CAHM @ SLIIT) was held on last week where the students and lecturers of the Academy geared up to show the public the facilities at CAHM and the benefits of joining the world of hospitality.

This day was filled with demonstrations and stations from napkin folding to wine tasting and the general public who attended the event had a taste of the food and drinks the students made; they were escorted around the campus and was educated with the courses that are available here at CAHM. There were past students who attended the event and they spoke to people who had queries and simply wanted to know about student life at CAHM.

There was quite a turn out as the main attraction for the day was the Culinary Arts Competition, organized by the CAHM kitchen. The objective of hosting such an event was in order to send one out of twelve students who participated to Kolkata, India to take part in the "Young Chef Olympiad Competition 2016" to represent the country. We at CAHM are proud to be the only hospitality institute that will take part in this well celebrated competition.
The esteemed judging panel comprised of Gourmet Circle Editor Narmada Muller, DIF Chairman and Managing Director Danu Innasithamby, CAHM CEO Steven Bradie-Miles and CAHM Past student Harsha Alahakoon who represented Sri Lanka at the "Young Chef Olympiad Competition" in 2015.

The students are introduced to the Culinary Arts aspect of the curriculum in the Certificate IV stage. Twelve students from Certificate IV, Diploma and Advanced Diploma took part in the Culinary Arts Competition where Weenu Winfried Braun from Certificate IV won first place and the opportunity of representing Sri Lanka and CAHM in Kolkata, India. In second place Geema Wijeyasiri from the Diploma batch received an award and in third place from the Advanced Diploma batch Johanne Rodrigo won an award.
The students who took part in this competition are completely new to the art of cooking but they have been guided by Chef Kapila Jayanetti and Surene, both lecturers at CAHM. A Culinary Arts Competition will mould a student in growing up to be professionals for themselves, as a team and also to the industry as a whole. Taking part in competitions such as "Young Chef Olympiad" is an experience of its own to aspiring chefs of the future as it increases creativity and brings opportunities to experiment with new ideas and products whilst sharing and gathering concepts.

The 10th Home Economics workshop was held at the Colombo Academy of Hospitality Management (CAHM) where the Academy invited the following schools - St. Anne's Wattala, Bandarawatta Mahavidyalaya Gampaha, Sri Seevali Mahavidyalaya Gampaha, Sri Rathnapala Mahavidyala Wattala, Karunaratne Buddhist College, Chandrajyoti Mahavidyalaya, Anura Mahavidyalaya Yakkala, Good Shepherd Balika Mahavidyala, Heenkenda Mahavidyalaya Ragama, Bandarawatta Parakrama Mahavidyalaya, Embaraluwa Mihindu Mahavidyalaya, Yashodara Devi Balika Vidyalaya Gampaha and Keerthipola Mahavidyalaya Minuwangoda as a CSR initiative to educate them on Hospitality and the Tourism industry.
