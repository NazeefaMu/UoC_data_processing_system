Japanese support for free Indo-Pacific Ocean

Foreign Affairs State Minister of Japan Kazuyuki Nakane said Japan has been supporting the maritime safety of Sri Lanka to realize a free, open, stable and prosperous Indo-Pacific Ocean.
The State Minister visited Sri Lanka on August 28 and stayed here till August 30.
He participated in the Commissioning Ceremony of patrol vessels and held meetings with Sri Lankan government leaders to promote bilateral relationships between the two countries.
The Commissioning Ceremony of the two patrol vessels provided by grant aid from the Government of Japan, valued at 1.8 billion yen (2.3 billion LKR), was held on August 29 at the Colombo Port.
Japan hopes that these vessels will improve the capacity of maritime law enforcement by the Sri Lankan Coast Guard Agency. These patrol vessels were named SLCGS Samudra Raksha and SLCGS Samaraksha by the Coast Guard.
State Minister Nakane called on Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and had meetings with Ministers Lakshman Kiriella, Navin Dissanayake, Secretary to the President Udaya Seneviratne.
The State Minister exchanged views and ways to further consolidate the “Japan-Sri Lanka Comprehensive Partnership” in maritime security and development cooperation, including through a new G7 Women, Peace and Security (WPS) Partnerships Initiative.
The G7 Initiative, which aims at accelerating positive change on gender equality, the empowerment of women and girls and respect for their human rights to achieving and sustaining peace through the WPS, was agreed at the recent G7 Foreign Ministers’ Meeting in April, 2018
State Minister Nakane appreciated the acceptance by the Government of Sri Lanka to partner with Japan to advance the WPS agenda and expressed Japan’s intention to support its efforts in cooperation with other G7 members.
