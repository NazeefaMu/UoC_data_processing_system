Attn: Pancake-People

I type on my laptop's screen, "Is the Internet making us stupid?". Press enter. In 0.39 seconds I receive 16,000,000 results. I feel frustrated – the fact that I have to Google to check my own stupidity is surely an indication of my increasing idiocy.
And, the scariest part is, I can feel it. I can feel my mind is changing. I feel it the most when I am reading. There used to be a time when I could completely immerse myself in a book for hours and hours. My mind would get so caught up in the narrative I find myself blissfully submerged in long stretches of prose. But sadly not anymore. Now my concentration often starts to drift after two or three pages. I get fidgety, I lose track, without giving it a seconds thought, I stop reading and search for something else to do. I feel as if I have to force my brain to stop wondering – often to my Facebook, WhatsApp or email accounts. The deep reading that used to come naturally has become a struggle.
A recent study (if you are into technology in a big way, as most of us are these days, you would probably have forgotten it by now) suggests 90 per cent of us are suffering from digital amnesia. More than 70 per cent of people don't know their sibling's phone numbers by heart, and 49 per cent have not memorized their partner's number. While those of us who grew up in a landline-only world may also remember friends' home numbers from that era, we are unlikely to know their current mobiles, as our phones do the job. The study conducted by the Kaspersky Lab concludes we don't commit data to memory because of the "Google Effect" – we're safe in the knowledge that answers are just a click away, and are happy to treat the web like an extension to our own memory.
Dr Maria Wimber, lecturer at the University of Birmingham's School of Psychology, endorses this fact, saying, the Internet simply changes the way we handle and store information, so the Google Effect "makes us good at remembering where to find a given bit of information, but not necessarily what the information was. It is likely to be true that we don't attempt to store information in our own memory to the same degree that we used to, because we know that the Internet knows everything."
These findings echo Columbia University Professor Betsy Sparrow's research on the Google Effect on memory, which concluded, "Our brains rely on the Internet for memory in much the same way they rely on the memory of a friend, family member or co-worker. We remember less through knowing information itself than by knowing where the information can be found."
This even extends to photographs. A Fairfield University study in 2003 found that taking photos reduces our memories. Participants were asked to look around a museum, and those who took photos of each object remembered fewer objects and details about them than those who simply observed. Dr Wimber says: "One could speculate that this extends to personal memories, as constantly looking at the world through the lens of our smartphone camera may result in us trusting our smartphones to store our memories for us. This way, we pay less attention to life itself and become worse at remembering events from our own lives."
Phone cameras apart, frequent users of smartphones quickly get used to the “auto-complete” function of their devices—the way they need only type a few letters and the phone fills in the rest. Maybe too used to it, in fact. According to research published in the journal Bioelectromagnetics this handy function seems to make adolescent users faster, but less accurate, when responding to a battery of cognitive tests.
Meanwhile, astudy led by researchers at the University of Coventry in Britain surveyed a group of eight- to twelve-year-olds about their texting habits, then asked them to write a sample text in the lab. The scientists found that kids who sent three or more text messages a day had significantly lower scores on literacy tests than children who sent none.
It appears even something as seemingly harmless as an email could be harmful to our brains. Trying to answer messages while also completing other work makes us measurably less intelligent. Glenn Wilson, psychiatrist at King’s College London University, monitored employees over the course of a workday and found that those who divided their attention between email and other tasks experienced a 10-point decline in IQ. Their decrease in intellectual ability was as great as if they had missed a whole night’s sleep, and twice as great as if they are addicted to drugs.
So, how do we get out of this mess? Anthropologist Dr Genevieve Bell, thinks it's easy. She says technology "helps us live smarter" as we are able to access answers. "Being able to create a well-formed question is an act of intelligence, as you quickly work out what information you want to extract and identify the app to help achieve this. To me, this suggests a level of engagement with the world that's not about dumbness." She gives the example of a new mother trying to work out whether her baby staying awake most of the night is bad – and when to start worrying. "These are all questions that technology may be able to address quicker than calling your own parents," she says. "This isn't making consumers more dumb, instead it's helping them to think smarter."
In contrast, Nicholas Carr, author of 'The Shallows: How the Internet is Changing the Way We Think, Read and Remember' believes we should be alarmed. "We're missing the real danger, that human memory is not the same as the memory in a computer: it's through remembering that we make connections with what we know, what we feel, and this gives rise to personal knowledge. If we're not forming rich connections in our own minds, we're not creating knowledge. Science tells us memory consolidation involves attentiveness: it's in this process that you form these connections."
Carr believes our brains are not like hard drives, or refrigerators that can get overstuffed so there's no more room. In contrast, he says they expand: "It's not as if remembering and thinking are separate processes. The more things you remember, the more material you have to work on, the more interesting your thoughts are likely to be," he says. In an essay written sometime ago, the playwright Richard Foreman eloquently described what’s at stake: “I come from a tradition of Western culture, in which the ideal (my ideal) was the complex, dense and “cathedral-like” structure of the highly educated and articulate personality—a man or woman who carried inside themselves a personally constructed and unique version of the entire an entire heritage. [But now] I see within us all (myself included) the replacement of complex inner density with a new kind of self—evolving under the pressure of information overload and the technology of the “instantly available.”
As we are drained of our “inner repertory of dense cultural inheritance,” Foreman concluded, we risk turning into “‘pancake people’—spread wide and thin as we connect with that vast network of information accessed by the mere touch of a button.”
Pancake People! Urgggh! Off I go; to switch off my laptop and smartphone; to pick up 'The Brother's Karamazov', shake off the dust and start reading. If you want to contact me, send a smoke signal.

Why technology makes you stupider
1. Tech makes it impossible to sleep.
Studies have shown that blue-enriched light, which is emitted by gadgets like smartphones, tablets and laptops makes it impossible to make you stick to a proper sleep schedule.
2. You are easily distracted.
3. You can’t remember much...
Technology’s tendency to butt into whatever else you are doing makes it more difficult to form new memories.
4. So you are relying on the Internet to remember things for you.
5. You are much more forgetful than you used to be.
6. You can’t find your way around without GPS.
