Unfortunately it went and struck the main electrical wires and it started burning right round the school premises. Then our peon Kamel caught me and took me to the Principal Srinath Kalinga Gunawardene. He immediately summoned the Electrical Department and they came and put off the fire. Then the Principal gave me four cuts and asked me to kneel down in front of his office until the school was over and to come with my parents the following day. I came with my mother and my mother said I was innocent. Then the Principal gave me a pair of boxing gloves and asked me to get hold of my friends and start boxing.
