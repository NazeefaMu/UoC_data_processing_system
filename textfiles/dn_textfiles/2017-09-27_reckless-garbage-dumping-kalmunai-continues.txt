Reckless garbage dumping in Kalmunai continues

Reckless garbage dumping at public places in the Kalmunai area has caused great inconvenience to the people. Residents in the area said they faced severe health hazard as a result.
The surrounding of Km/Km/Mahmood Ladies College, Kalmunai is increasingly polluted with garbage dumps. Over 3,000 students attend the school and they face danger of getting infected with diseases since the area is highly congested with mosquitoes, rats and other insects that thrive in garbage dumps.
More often, flies, rats and mosquitoes can be seen in classrooms and schoolchildren and teachers cannot concentrate on their subjects as a result.
Before long, another dengue outbreak will hit the region if the authorities do not take steps to clear the garbage dumps, residents said.
Many stray dogs are also seen in the area searching foods in the garbage dumps, they said.
