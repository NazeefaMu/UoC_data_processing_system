The recent award ceremony also recognized Airtel’s performance and service excellence under two important categories: Best HR Strategy and Best HR Strategy in Line with the Business.
People are the asset that drives the business forward therefore Airtel’s HR strategy is a part of the overall business strategy.
Numerous awards and accolades topped with a continuous winning streak, stand testament to Airtel’s bottom up approach in developing strategy, transparency and good governance.
Unlike the traditional top-down strategy, Airtel takes pride in its highly innovative strategy which takes all stakeholders into account towards making a positive change.
The company takes measures to review and revise strategies annually and customize them in line with the internal and external stakeholders and market conditions. Moreover, the company’s CEO has taken upon himself the responsibility of cascading the strategy to all employees.
Bharti Airtel Lanka CEO Jinesh Hegde said, “People are the core of our business; the Airtel family believes in working together as a team towards a common goal."
