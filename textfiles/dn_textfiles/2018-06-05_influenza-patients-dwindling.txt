Influenza patients dwindling

The number of influenza patients reported in hospitals such as Kamburupitiya, Matara and Karapitiya had significantly reduced. Not a single patient had been admitted to these hospitals as of June 1, Health Services Director General Dr. Anil Jasinghe said.
Addressing a press conference held at his office in Colombo yesterday, he said all required medical equipment, drugs, and especially children's ICU beds have been provided to the required hospitals to treat influenza patients.
Rs. 30 million was allocated to the Southern Province Health Services Director to buy the required equipment and drugs.
“The only way of preventing the influenza virus infection is by keeping a good personal hygiene. This is the preventive method in the world. No country completely relies on flu prevention vaccines. Therefore, people should follow the advice of doctors and health authorities to protect themselves from the virus, he said.
Consultant Epidemiologist Dr. Samitha Ginige said there is no vaccine or drug to prevent virus infections and the only way to prevent is by keeping a good personal hygiene. Wearing masks, washing hands, avoiding crowded places etc. can help prevent infections. The droplets that spread the infections can travel for about one metre. Keeping sick children at home without sending them to school, tuition, and daycare will help prevent complications, he said.
People in high risk categories such as older people (above 65years) or very young children (below 2 years), pregnant women, lactating mothers, people with suppressed immunity and those with chronic diabetes, chronic obstructive airways disease, heart, liver, kidney and metabolic diseases, persons who had undergone major surgeries recently, etc. should seek medical treatment for influenza from a qualified doctor, he said.
Consultant Virologist attached to the Medical Research Institute (MRI) Dr. Chrishan Jude Jayamaha said Influenza A virus was found in most samples tested since May 1 and a total of 159 samples (swabs) were received from the Karapitiya hospital while most of them were of children. This condition is a common phenomenon during this season (May, June, July) every year. Adino virus and RSV are also found. The Adino virus can exist in children's phlegm even for a few months, he said.
