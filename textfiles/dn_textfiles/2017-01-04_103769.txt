He was addressing a party suppoters’ meeting at Angunakolapelessa.
He said he met as the UPFA General Secretary the Election Commisioner and told him to expedite holding local government elections. He said the Commissioner said the elections will be held in the first quarter of this year. The minister further said the UPFA will support the Development Special Act if it is presented with adjustments conducive to the people and the country.
Amaraweera said a false rumour that the land in Hambantota will be sold to the Chinese is spread by a defeated politicians to gain political advantage.
