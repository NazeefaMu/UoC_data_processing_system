Konta downs Venus to reach Miami final

MIAMI AFP March31, 2017 : Britain's Johanna Konta beat Venus Williams 6-4, 7-5 in a grueling battle Thursday to reach the WTA Miami Open final, where she will face Caroline Wozniacki of Denmark.
The Australian-born 25-year-old broke Williams in the first game and played aggressively throughout the opening set. Williams fought back strongly in the second set, breaking to go up 3-1. But Konta broke back immediately and again for a 5-4 lead that allowed her to serve for the match. The American took advantage of some nervy play from the 10th-seed to break back, but Williams was unable to hold serve and that gave Konta a second chance to wrap up the contest, which she did after more than two hours.
Konta said she expects a big challenge ahead in order to capture her second title of the year after a Sydney crown. “I am going to have a tough battle on my hands,” Konta said. “Caroline makes you work.” Wozniacki booked her place in the final after rallying to defeat Czech second seed Karolina Pliskova 5-7, 6-1, 6-1.
