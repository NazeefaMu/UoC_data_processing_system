Trade Unions in danger  under new Act: GMOA

All trade unions could be labeled as ‘ Terrorists’ Organizations’ under the new Terrorism Prevention Act, the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
The GMOA requests the President to find out whether the Health Minister had undertaken a local or foreign contract to destroy the entire free health service and medical education in Sri Lanka. The GMOA will take islandwide trade union action without further notice if the issues was not solved within one week, he added.
