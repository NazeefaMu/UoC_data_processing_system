Colombo City Centre mixed development project gets going

 
Colombo City Centre, a revolutionary mixed development project by the Abans Group in partnership with Silver Needle Hospitality that aims to redefine the true meaning of urban luxury living at the heart of Colombo.
Being an impressive feat of innovative architecture and engineering, the Colombo City Centre, offers potential investors the opportunity to access everything under one roof, truly making it a place like no other.
Located along Sir James Peiris Mawatha, Colombo-02, this ultra-modern mixed use 47-storey lifestyle centre will feature a contemporary lifestyle retail shopping mall; an upscale hotel operated by Next Hotels – the flagship brand of Silver Needle Hospitality; and opulent apartment residences that will provide a radical take on luxury real estate in Sri Lanka.
Offering awe-inspiring views of the Beira Lake, Indian Ocean, and, at night, the luminous city skyline that inspire both calmness and tranquility, the Colombo City Centre Residences are uniquely designed to accommodate Sri Lankan high-end lifestyles as well as meet the diverse needs conveyed by affluent homeowners today.
Extending over five floors, this mall has been designed to provide an enjoyable, one-of-a-kind retail and entertainment experience for brand-conscious, affluent consumers and their families.
The Colombo City Centre has been strategically positioned in a fast developing, upmarket location. Apartment values have also appreciated about 40% since the previous year, due to the Colombo City Centre’s mixed development nature. This makes the Colombo City Centre perfect for affluent homeowners and investors who seek good capital appreciation and rental return as well as high ROI on their investments.
Due to these factors, Sri Lanka, and Colombo possess the potential of becoming an active luxury real estate hub in Asia, which will result in stronger dividends for investors who decide to invest in our region via the Colombo City Centre.
