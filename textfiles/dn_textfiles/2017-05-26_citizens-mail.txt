Why the Buddha is no Lord
At the outset let me thank you for the courage in publishing Upali S. Jayaskera’s above captioned letter where he rejects the title LORD referring to Buddha and has correctly explained the historical blunder in identifying the word ‘BUDDHA’ where he says ‘Buddha is not a proper noun as such. It is a generic noun to refer to one who has obtained Supreme Enlightenment’.
Then who is a Lord? Lord is an application for a person or deity who has authority, control or power over others; acting like a master, a chief or a ruler. The appellation can also denote certain persons who hold a title of the peerage in the United Kingdom or are entitled to courtesy titles.
In supporting Upali S Jayasekera, let me explain the meaning of the word ‘Buddha’. Buddha is derived from the Sanskrit word ‘Buddhi’ which means wisdom and enlightenment.
It is a title or qualification as much as a doctorate obtained at a university. Then the question arises as to why we Buddhists offer flowers at a statue in temples. Is it to the icon of WISDOM (BUDDHI) or to the person who attained that stage – Prince Siddhartha Gauthama? If it is the latter, then the use of the word Buddhism is ambiguous or a misnomer. If that argument or reasoning is accepted, then Buddhism should be identified with Prince Siddhartha Gauthama and termed ‘GAUTHAMISM’ as much as Christianity, the founder Jesus Christ and Mohammedism with Prophet Mohammed. It would be interesting to have responses to this view.
