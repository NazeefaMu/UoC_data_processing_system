First Capital signs third MoU with Oxford Business Group

Investment Bank, First Capital Holdings PLC has signed a third memorandum of understanding (MoU) with OBG for its forthcoming publication. Under the MoU, the firm will once again share its experience of the local capital market to produce the Capital Markets Chapter of The Report: Sri Lanka 2018, contributing in-depth analysis of both the Equity and Government Securities markets.
Dilshan Wirasekara, Director and CEO of First Capital, said he looked forward to working with OBG’s team once again and documenting the latest developments in the investment landscape against Sri Lanka’s rapidly evolving economy.
“Forecasts point to a revival in private sector credit growth in the second part of 2018, which is expected to boost the performance of Sri Lanka’s banks, enabling them to benefit from robust levels of capitalisation and, in turn, better returns on equity,” he said.
“With the country’s major infrastructure drive and other construction projects already helping to stimulate economic activity and attract greater inflows, the outlook for capital market expansion looks bright.”
“The teams at First Capital are known to be experts in their field, with an in-depth knowledge of the local and regional markets. I’m delighted that our readers will once again benefit from their analysis of market activity and potential opportunities at the CSE,” Michael Todemann, OBG’s editorial manager in Sri Lanka said.
Oxford Business Group is a global research and consultancy company with a presence in over 30 countries, from Asia, Africa and the Middle East to the Americas. A distinctive and respected provider of on-the-ground intelligence on many of the world’s fastest growing markets, OBG has offices in London, Berlin, Dubai and Istanbul, and a network of local bureaus across the countries in which we operate.
