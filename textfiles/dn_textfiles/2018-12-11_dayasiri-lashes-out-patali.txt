Attempt to intimidate Ministry Secretaries
Dayasiri lashes out at Patali

Parliamentarian Dayasiri Jayasekera yesterday blamed UNF Parliamentarian Patali Champaka Ranawaka for attempting to cripple public service by intimidating Ministry Secretaries.
Jayasekera added Ranawaka said that several Ministry Secretaries would be summoned before Parliamentary Committees for questioning on the basis of recent decisions taken by them.
He asked Ranawaka as to how these officials can be summoned before Parliamentary Committees, when Parliament has not appointed these Committees yet.
“Parliament has not appointed a Committee on Public Accounts, Committee on Public Enterprise of Priviledge Committee. How can Ranawaka summon them before these committees under this situation,” he queried.
Addressing a press conference at the SLFP headquarters yesterday, Jayasekera requested all Ministry Secretaries not to show hesitation in discharging their service to the public.
He said that the public service should function efficiently as the Prime Minister and the Cabinet of Ministers have been temporarily prevented from discharging their duties.
“Public servants should take the country forward at this point of time. Nobody can think where this country would be, if the public servants were not in a position to discharge their duties,” Jayasekera said
He said that they are ready to stand up for the public servants.
“We will extend our fullest cooperation to all public servants in the country,” he said.
He commended the Government officials for discharging their duties despite the political instability in the country. “The public service continues unabated because of public servants,” he said.
Jayasekera added that President Maithripala Sirisena has become the most powerful leader in the country since 1802 with the temporary Court of Appeal order preventing the Cabinet of Ministers holding office.
“A king is now ruling country and his order has come into force in every nook and corner of the country,” he said.
Jayasekera added that the previous government harassed public servants who worked tirelessly for the well-being of the public by establishing the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID).
Public officials showed hesitation in discharging their service to the public during the previous regime. Honest government servants were afraid of discharging their duties because of these type of institutions established by the previous government.
