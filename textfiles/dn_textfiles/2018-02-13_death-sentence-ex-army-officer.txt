Wellawa triple murder case
Death sentence for ex-Army officer

The accused in the Wellawa triple murder case was sentenced to death by Kurunegala High Court Judge Menaka Wijesundara yesterday.
The accused, former Army Officer R.M. Rathnayake, was indicted by the Attorney General with committing the murder of R.M. Dharmasena, R.M. Abeyrathna and Chandana Kumara Jayarathna on March 29, 2004, at the Wellawa Police Station.
The accused had shot them.
The prosecution with assistance from State Counsel Tharaka Dharmasiri had proved the charge against the accused beyond reasonable doubt. The High Court Judge asked the accused whether he had anything to say before the sentence was passed. He told court that he was innocent of the crimes and the prosecution witnesses had given false evidence against him.
State Counsel Tharaka Dharmasiri prosecuted, while attorney Lakmal Rathnayake appeared for the accused.
