These routine transactions include transfer funds to any account (own accounts, third party BOC accounts or other bank accounts), account inquiries, instant, scheduled and recurring utility bill payments.
Managing and monitoring your assets and liabilities are also made easy with the mobile screen friendly interface. Customers can set up standing orders, check book requests and statement downloads without having to visit the branch.
In case of an emergency customers themselves can issue “Stop payment” to cheques issued on current accounts immediately. Since “B-App” has a secured one-time password and self-unlock user ID that allows the user to “self-unlock”, to save time and enhance productivity.

So anyone with minimal knowledge of operating a smartphone can manage to get the maximum use from it,” said Deputy General Manager Product and Banking Development, M.J.P. Salgado.
