Fourth ODI between New Zealand - Sri Lanka washed out

The fourth One-Day International (ODI) between New Zealand and Sri Lanka has been washed out, as only nine overs could be played at Saxton Oval Ground, in Nelson and Sri Lanka will remain 1-2 behind, which ends their chances of winning series.
 
The rain did not let the match start on time and did not let it start for three hours. The match was reduced to 24 overs after that and Sri Lankan captain Angelo Matthews chose to field first after winning the toss.
 
New Zealand got off to a flying start as they scored 37 in first three overs. Martin Guptill scored 27 off 14 balls as he hit 3 sixes. But then Sri Lanka got few wickets and New Zealand were 53/3 after losing their captain Kane Williamson and both openers.
 
The hosts were 75/3 in 9 overs when rain came again and this time match officials announced that the match has ended without any result. The fifth and last ODI will be played in Mount Maunganui and Sri Lanka will have to win that to level the series. (cricketnewsworld)
