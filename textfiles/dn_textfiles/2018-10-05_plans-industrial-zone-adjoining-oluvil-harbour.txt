Plans for industrial zone adjoining Oluvil Harbour

Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe who visited Oluvil Harbour on Wednesday said that the adjoining areas of Oluvil would be converted into an Industrial Zone providing a regular income to the harbour, paving the way for villagers to attain a sound economic position.
Minister Samarasinghe accompanied by City Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauff Hakeem held top-level discussions with the officials, Deputy Ministers and MPs of the area and the villagers of Oluvil.
He also noted that construction of the harbour was carried out at a cost of US$ 50 million and the loans taken for this purpose are being repaid now. So this project will not be abandoned and would be continued. Moreover, it was the late Minister M.H.M. Ashraff’s dream and he planned it for the economic welfare of the people of the area.
All measures would be taken to solve the problems caused to fishermen by sand dunes. A committee consisting of relevant officials along with Coast Conservation Department would look into the problems and take all remedial measures, the Minister said.
Minister Samarasinghe said speedy action would be taken to pay compensation to those who lost their lands to the Port project.
Deputy Minitser H.M.M. Harees, MPs A.L.M. Naseer, M.I.M. Mansoor, Dr. S.M.M. Ismail and officials from the Ports Authority also participated in the discussion.
