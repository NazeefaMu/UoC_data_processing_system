‘Even the largest airplanes can now safely land at BIA’

Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva said that the landing of the Emirates Airbus A380 aircraft at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) signified the fact that even the largest airplanes in the world can now safely land at the newly reconstructed runaway of BIA without any problem.
He made these remarks participating in a welcoming ceremony for one of the world’s largest aircrafts, Emirates Airbus A380, with a seat capacity of 550 held at the BIA recently.
The aircraft, flown by Sri Lankan Pilot Udaya Tilakaratna, arrived at the airport with 524 passengers on board.
He said that many people, including certain politicians predicted that the A380 aircrafts cannot land at BIA even after the resurfacing of the runway at a cost of Rs. 7.2 billion after 30 years. They said that the money spent for this project had gone down the drain.
Several media reports had also claimed that this project was not up to international standards; that the largest of aircrafts would be unable to access this newly modernized runway. However, all these predictions had now been proven false after the landing of the Emirates A380 aircraft.
“Pessimists will say various things about our service, but we not be shaken,” he added.
Plans are afoot to launch massive development activities to upgrade the facilities of the BIA. Tenders have already been called for the construction of a second international terminal as well.
The management of Emirates had agreed to fly once a month between Dubai and Sri Lanka and it will pave the way to attract more tourists to the island.
He further added that the Government is keen to popularize Mattala airport among the international passengers by upgrading its facilities. “We also had discussions with Indian investors to attract more airlines from all over the world to Mattala,” he said.
