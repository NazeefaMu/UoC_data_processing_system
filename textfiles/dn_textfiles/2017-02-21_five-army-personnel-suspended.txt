Five Army personnel suspended

The five Army personnel arrested and remanded over the 2008 abduction, assault and false imprisonment of senior journalist Keith Noyahr have been suspended from duties, the Military Spokesman said. Noyahr had been abducted on May 11, 2008 by unknown persons. Releasing a statement following the incident, the publishing company where Noyahr worked claimed the abduction followed a series of threats against Noyahr. He was known for his critical analyses of Sri Lanka’s security situation during the war in his column which he wrote under a pseudonym.
