INCREASING CABINET MINISTERS ABOVE 30 :
SUPREME COURT OPINION TO BE SOUGHT

The government through the President would seek the opinion of the Supreme Court to determine the exact number of Cabinet Portfolios that it could hold, Environment Deputy Minister Ajith Mannapperuma told the Daily News.
He said according to the country’s Constitution, the number of Cabinet portfolios that a single party government can hold is 30. But, the government would seek the opinion of the Supreme Court as to whether it can increase this number up to 32 as both the President and the Prime Minister are also holding portfolios.
Seeking the opinion of the SC before doing such a change would be better than having different explanations by various parties as the 19th Amendment to the constitution is also in force, the Deputy Minister added.
When asked whether the new government led by the United National Party would run in the nature of a unity government, he said they would consider in this regard as the United National Front has the support of many political parties. The Sri Lanka Muslim Congress and the SLFP MPs are supporting the government at present, he pointed out.
The Deputy Minister also spoke about the Opposition Leadership of the House. He said selecting the Opposition Leader is not a duty of the government. The MP who represents the majority of the Opposition and has no connection to the government party should be Opposition Leader, the Deputy Minister said.
However, Mannapperuma emphasized that there is no influence from their government in selecting the Opposition Leader of the House.
