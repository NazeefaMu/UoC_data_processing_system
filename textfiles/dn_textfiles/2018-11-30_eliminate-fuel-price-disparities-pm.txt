Eliminate fuel price disparities - PM

Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa has instructed the subject minister to discuss with relevant officials to take action to eliminate fuel price disparities between the LIOC and CPC.
PM Rajapaksa instructed Minister Gamini Lokuge to take action to eliminate these disparities, the Prime Minister’s office said.
The Premier gave these instructions at a meeting with fuel delivery agents of the Lanka Indian Oil Company (LIOC) held at the Prime Minister’s Office yesterday.
The agents had requested the Prime Minister to take action to bring fuel selling prices of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) and LIOC to a same level.They had pointed out that the CPC fuel prices are lower than the LIOC prices and it caused losses for the LIOC agents, which had higher prices.
