Election dates decided by EC, President or minister: Deshapriya

 
No one can fix a date for elections except the Elections Commission, President or the subject minister, Election Commission, Elections Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya said.
Deshapriya addressing the media yesterday said that in accordance with election laws, media, politicians, or astrologers cannot talk about an election date. He added that the Election Commission has no powers to punish anyone or file cases against anyone.
"Those should be done in collaboration with the other institutions and people who have powers." The chairman said the Local Government elections can be held after the verdict is delivered in case with regard to the Local Government elections or after receiving the report of the evaluation committee, established to look into holding the Local Government polls. Accordingly, the election date can be announced based on either the committee report or the verdict of the case, Deshapriya added. "However, we know through experience that social media talk much on elections when an election is at hand. It can be observed these days that social media is talking a lot on the Local Government polls," he said. Deshapriya said amendments bearing number 22 of 2012 of the Local Government Elections Act were being implemented.
He added that the terms of most Local Government bodies expired by May 2015.
Deshapriya said the Election Commission will work towards giving voting rights for all.
