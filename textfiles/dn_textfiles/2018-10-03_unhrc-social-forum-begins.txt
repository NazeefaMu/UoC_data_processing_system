UNHRC Social Forum begins

This year’s United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) Social Forum began on Monday in Geneva, with Sri Lanka’s Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador A.L.A. Azeez as the Chairperson-Rapporteur, alongside Human Rights High Commissioner Michelle Bachelet and Council President Vogislav Suc. This three-day Forum will address the possibilities of promoting human rights as well as the strengthening of universal respect.
Ambassador Azeez said, “This Forum has served as an inclusive platform for multi-stakeholders and has enabled deep reflection, among participants, on important themes that could promote diverse aspects of intersectionality between human rights and society.”
He said that at a time when every norm and value on which the UN, international order, and multilateralism stood was being put to the test in today’s globalised yet volatile world, the Social Forum enabled the exchange of diverse perspectives aimed to strengthen and elaborate such norms and values.
High Commissioner Bachelet highlighted the importance of sports as a tool for social empowerment.
Ambassador Suc also addressed the opening session.
This year’s Social Forum consists of nine sessions followed by dialogues covering wider range of themes such as Sports, Human Solidarity and Universal Values for All Humanity; Sports and the “Equal Rights of Men and Women”; Inclusivity, Equality and Non-Discrimination in Sport; Sports, Sustainable Cities and the Right to an Adequate Standard of Living; Sports for Sustainable Development and Sustained Peace; and Youth, Children and Future Generations.
A documentary created by the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation on how sports and sports-persons impact society in our journey to peace and reconciliation was screened.
The Forum will end with a musical presentation by the UN Music Team titled a World Premiere ‘Racing for Peace’, which symbolises Sri Lankans’ desire and commitment for lasting peace and advancement of human rights.
