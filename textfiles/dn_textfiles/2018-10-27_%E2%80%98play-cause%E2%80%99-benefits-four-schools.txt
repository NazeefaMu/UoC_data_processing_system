139th Battle of the Blues:
‘Play for a Cause’ benefits four schools

The 139th ‘Battle of the Blues’ annual cricket encounter between Royal College, Colombo, and S. Thomas’ College, Mt. Lavinia, this year saw four schools benefit from ‘Play for a Cause’, the annual sustainability project of this traditional encounter.
H/Theraputta National School, Ambalantota, Kirindiwela MMV, Kirindiwela, Victoria College, Chulipuram and Pothuwila MMV, Pothuwila were selected as the worthy beneficiaries by Royal College, Colombo and S. Thomas’ College, Mt. Lavinia. In 2015, at the 136th edition of the Royal-Thomian, Sri Lanka’s premier connectivity provider, Dialog Axiata PLC rekindled a long and successful partnership with Sri Lanka’s Blue Ribbon Big Match, the Battle of the Blues and made a pledge to contribute 1,000 rupees for every run scored and 10,000 rupees for every wicket that fell.
This year’s exciting encounter contributed 1,018,000 rupees to the ‘Play for a Cause’ pledge.
Since the inception of the ‘Play for a Cause’ pledge, inclusive of the 139th Battle of the Blues, 3,977,000 rupees worth of cricket gear was donated to fourteen deserving schools.
