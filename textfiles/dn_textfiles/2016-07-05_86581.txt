As Ushan Perera took over after the first pit stop he was able to extend the lead to overs 2 laps for the team, who were second after the first stint. He showed tremendous pace and was able to display some splendid over taking moves to increase that lead as he handed over to Kevin Perera. As he took over, he was able to hold his position, driving a great battle with Jason Caron of Thunderbolt racing as both of them displayed aggressive yet respectful driving and exchanged positions multiple times but Kevin Perera was eventually able to retain his position.
