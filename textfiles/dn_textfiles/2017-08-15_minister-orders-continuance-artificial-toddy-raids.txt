Minister orders continuance of artificial toddy raids

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne had informed the Police and Excise Department to continue to raid all artificial toddy transported to the Kalutara district from the North Western (Wayamba) Province, Health Ministry Spokesman said.
According to the Spokesman, Minister Senaratne had ordered a report on raids. The Minister also revealed that several complaints had been received on the increasing sale of `Kerala Ganja' in Darga Town, Aluthgama. Some persons who sell the illegal drugs had bribed certain MPs and police, he said.
Further, the minister had ordered to carry out a survey on houses without electricity in the Beruwala electorate in order to provide electricity to them, he said.
Minister Senaratne instructed health officials to allocate a part of a ward in each state hospital for Buddhist Bhikkus in order to make it easy for doctors to treat them, he added.
