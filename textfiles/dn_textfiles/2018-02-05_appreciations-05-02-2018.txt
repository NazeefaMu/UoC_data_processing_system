[APPRECIATIONS - (05-02-2018)]

Rev. Bro. Stephen Modestus
An indelible influence
It is with sorrow that I write this appreciation of Rev. Bro. Modestus FSC, who passed away peacefully on February 7, 2003. Bro. Modestus was the first old boy Director of St. Sebastian's College, Moratuwa, and in addition, he later became Director of St. Benedict's College, Kotahena, as well. Bro. Modestus hailed from Katukurunda in Moratuwa and was the son of Joseph Peiris and Inez Bastiana Fernando. He was the second Moratuwite to join the La Sallian Institute—the first being Rev. Bro. Cassim Charles. He joined the juniorate in September, 1930, and after a brief period, went to the novitiate in Penang.
In August, 1932, Bro. Stephen entered the scholasticate at Mutwal and took his vows as a Christian Brother. In January, 1934, he joined De Mazenod College, Kandana, as a teacher and at the end of that year, joined St. Mary's School, Pettah. ln 1939, he was transferred to the De La Salle College, to be in charge of the kindergarten department. He was also involved in various activities relating to the primary school.
He took over the St. Benedict's College branch at Veyangoda as principal and was also in charge of its boarding house. ln 1945, he was re-transferred St. Benedict's College, Kotahena, as the prefect of boarders and the junior classes. From 1947 to 1954, he served as the principal of the primary school, prefect of boarders and prefect of games at De Mazenod College. Subsequently, he was appointed as the principal of St. Andrew’s College, Puttalam.
In 1956, he came back to St. Sebastian's College as the principal of the primary department and sub-director of the College. In 1959, he became the director and thereby, created history as the first past pupil to become the director of the school. Due to his efforts, the number of students enrolling rose to 1,500, with 99 percent of them being Catholics. It was also he who formed the scout troop, which brought many a glory to the school.
During this period, Bro. Modestus’ winning ways earned himself the invaluable assistance of the then Moratuwa parish priest Rt. Rev. Dr. Edmund Fernando—the Bishop of Badulla. He found many ways to raise funds for the college. In 1964, he returned to St. Benedict's College as head of the primary department and prefect of boarders and ultimately became the acting director. In 1977, he went into retirement, yet in 1978, returned to St. Sebastian's College. The government recognized his services in the sphere of education and appointed him an All-Island Justice of Peace.
May his soul rest in peace.

Dr A. J. M. J. B. Walalawela
charismatic man
Nirvana is not the blowing out of the candle. It is the extinguishing of the flame because the day is come.- Rabindranath Tagore.
Walale, as he was known to his friends, was a charismatic, soft-spoken, young medical student when we first met him at the Medicine, Dentistry and Veterinary Sciences Faculty of the Peradeniya University on January 18, 1972—the date he referred to as the jour de gloire in his editorial for the souvenir published at the reunion in October, 2016.
On being awarded his medical degree, the young Dr. Walawela was posted to the Badulla General Hospital, where he undertook his early training, followed by a tenure as a medical officer at Minipe and then at Deltota in the Central Province. Towards the end of 1983, he travelled to Oman for a brief spell as a general practitioner, and on returning to Sri Lanka, he was betrothed to Nilani Ratnayake, a school teacher whom he later married on September 19, 1985. Attracted to the specialty of medical administration, he took up the position of deputy director at the Peradeniya University Hospital, serving the people of Kandy his place of birth.
He took special responsibilities for the education of professions allied to medicine, especially the area of nursing. He was then promoted as the medical services regional director for the Monaragela district, ensuring the smooth functioning of government institutions. He was skillful and fair, but a firm administrator with an affable personality whose admirable qualities held him in good stead to uphold the ethos contained within the national policy of providing a free medical service to the people of Sri Lanka.
He was subsequently appointed by the Health Ministry as the National Quarantine Services director, taking charge of preventive health with the main focus on the ports of entry, playing a vital role at the peak of the avian AHIN1 flu epidemic. He represented Sri Lanka at the ASEAN Conference held in Manilla, Philippines, in 2009; chairing some of the plenaries addressing the challenges posed by the avian flu epidemic in the South East Asian region. He was also called in to manage the crisis that followed the scandal in connection with the importation of digestive biscuits from India, around the same time.Walale retired from the national health service in 2010, at the compulsory retirement age of 60. Being a workaholic, he was unable to decline an offer as the company medical director for a private sector establishment, the Ihala Kothmale plant based in Talawakalle, where he spent the next two years, by which time he had spent most of his working life serving the nation away from Kandy—away from his family. His failing health at that stage meant that he was unable to continue his job. He returned to Kandy to spend his remaining days at Katugastota, in his family home, with his wife and children.
Jayananda Bandara Walalawela was born on November 9, 1950. He was one of six children. His father was a direct descendant of Dingirirala, who while dwelling in the village of Walalawela in the Hangurangetha district, rebelled alongside Puran Appu and Gongale Goda banda, against the British in the mid-18th century.
He received his primary education in Kandy at Vidyartha College, moving on to St. Sylvester’s. With academic achievements at both schools, Walale entered the Ceylon University, as it was then called, in 1972, opting to read medicine at the historic and scenic Paradeniya campus.
A modest man of ethical principles focused on simple living, he defied many of his contemporaries during the 1983 civil unrest and the ensuing turmoil often referred to as
Black July, treating the victims of violence with compassion, no matter which ethnic background they belonged to—something his son Niluksha recalls with pride.
An avid reader, a linguist with an aptitude for Sinhala, English, and French, Walale was a great admirer and follower of the late Prof. Ediriweera Sarathchandra, the renowned playwright and dramatist. Gifted with a liberal mind and incisive analytical skill, he was a caring father and a loving husband, never prescriptive towards his children. His daughter, Chamalka, reminisces how Walale discouraged them from sitting their year five scholarship exams, for he believed that children should learn, but not be compelled to compete at this young age; a view that is shared by many contemporary western educationalists promoting equality.
Walale was a grateful servant of his alma mater, actively contributing to the OBA functions. He had an interest in tennis, rugby, and cricket, volunteering as a sports medical officer to various organisations. He accompanied the SAARC team to India in the early 90's as its medical officer. He wrote to newspapers in his spare time and also organised several blood donation camps.
Although a quite and an unassuming introvert, he was a raconteur of class, fondly remembered by his batch mates as the great networker who brought them together to Kandy in October, 2016, to celebrate a reunion 40 years since graduation—a remarkable feat, given that this batch is now scattered all around the globe. Many of his friends will recall the trouble he took to attend the event with Nilani despite his poor health, for he wanted to be among us, celebrating the big day. Little did we realise that it was going to be our last meeting with him in person!
A nominal Buddhist with an altruistic attitude towards humanity, Dr. Walalawela’s legacy could be described in the words of Martin Luther King Jr., who once said, “The quality, not the longevity, of one’s life, is what is important.”
May his soul rest in peace.
Dr. Jayananda Bandara Walalawela was called to rest on the Dec 25, 2017, and is survived by his son, Niluksha; daughter, Chamalka; and wife, Nilani. Dr. Chandra Abrew, Dr. Gamini Jayasekera, Dr. Nanda Wahalawatte, and Dr. Sathi Ariyanayagam
Gamini Iryagolla
Honest patriot
Gamini Iryagolla was the son of late veteran politician I. M. R. A. Iriyagolla. He was educated at Royal College, Colombo 7.
He was a constitutional lawyer, writer, political critic and civil servant, and was also a patriot who took an honest effort to eradicate the country's ethnic conflict.
Dear Gamini, you always strove to create a rapport among the various nationalities in or country. As a Buddhist, you always followed the ways of the Buddha.
May you attain he Supreme Bliss of Nibbana.

M. J. Tissainayagam
Man of integrity
I consider it a great honour and privilege to have been given the opportunity of paying a tribute to my one-time colleague and friend late M. J. Tissainayagam and to commemorate his exemplary life and illustrious career.
Tissainayagam lived a healthy, fruitful and blissful life of nearly 97 years, which in itself is ample testimony to the sober, principled and disciplined life he led. The secret of his longevity lies in the fact that he did not over-indulge in the temptations of life. He did not over-eat, over-dress or overspend. He shunned ostentatious living. The net result was that he was not afflicted by debilitating diseases.
He was born on July 12, 1920, into an aristocratic Tamil family from Jaffna. His father was the late G. S. Tissainayagam, who was one of the earliest Ceylonese to hold the post of district engineer in the Public Works Department (the forerunner to the Highways Department). Thanks to the spread of missionary education under the British rule, Tissainayagam was able to obtain a wholesome and liberal education from three of the best known educational institutions; namely Trinity College, Kandy, St. John's College, Jaffna, and St. Thomas’ College, Mount Lavinia. His educational pursuits earned him two degrees from the London University; namely BA in Arts and BSc. in Economics, which at that time, was a rare feat.
After graduation, he chose a journalistic career and served with distinction as a columnist and sub-editor at the Times of Ceylon in the late 1940's. His writing caught the eye of the Times Editor Frank Moraes, who sent him to England for further training in 1947. He worked for the Manchester Guardian, among other newspapers in England. He returned to Ceylon in 1950 and entered what was his most productive period as a journalist. He wrote the column Not that it Matters for the Times of Ceylon. He then moved from the Times Group to its rival, Lake House, as leader-writer, columnist and a sub-editor for the Observer and Daily News. There, he wrote a column known as Men and Matters under the pen name Thissayan.
In October, 1953, Tissainayagam entered the Government Civil Service by joining the Government Information Department as an assistant director. He was promoted to deputy director in 1968 and reached the top as the Government Information Department (D.G.I as its known today) director in 1977. He retired in 1978 after serving in the Department for 25 years. He also functioned as the Government Film Unit (GFU) director between 1972 and 1974.
I first met Tiss (as he was fondly called) 55 years ago in 1962, when the Information and Broadcasting departments were amalgamated and brought under one roof under one Director General. At that time, radio broadcasting was a state monopoly and I held the post of Broadcasting and National Service director and Tiss was the Government Information Department assistant director. During his tenure of office in the Government Information Department, he was called upon to function as the chief co-ordinator and press liaison officer during Queen Elizabeth II's visit to Ceylon in 1954, The Asian Prime Ministers’ Conference in 1955, and the Non-Aligned Heads of State Summit in 1976. Whilst holding the post of Government Information Department assistant/deputy director, Tissainayagam was also appointed as the competent authority on press censorship at various times of national crisis—prominent among them being the assassination of former Prime Minister S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike in 1959, the aftermath of the failed military coup d'etat of 1962, and the first JVP insurrection in 1971.
He also headed the first Ceylon Government Press Delegation to China in 1958. During his tenure in the department, he was the Ceylon Today editor—the monthly journal of the Government Information Department from 1954 to 1972, in addition to being the editor of numerous other publications as well.
Even though Tissainayagam retired from government service in 1978, he was too good a public treasure to be allowed to wither away into oblivion. Thus in 1979, Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa called him back into the administrative service by offering him the post of assistant secretary in the Prime Minister's Office, which he accepted. For Tiss, this marked the beginning of another long innings of 15 years. Once again, I had the privilege of working with him when I assumed duties as the Prime Minister's secretary in 1983.
For four decades, from 1953 to 1994, Tissainayagam was impeccable in communicating information in readable, lucid prose. He was never found wanting in his job, for he was intelligent and far-sighted. His non-abrasive, kind and genial personality enabled him to win friends and influence people. Above all, his honesty and integrity were beyond reproach.
His allegiance and service to the government were good as those to God. He always acted as the guardian deity of his family; especially his wife, Ratnaleela and children Jeyaprakash and Romesh, who treasured him and now, sadly miss him.
May his soul rest in peace!

Albert Fernando
Courteous individual
It has been 21 years since Albert Clarence Fernando entered eternal glory to be with his maker. February 11, 2018 will be his 21st death anniversary. He was the clerical staff chief of St. Sebastian's College, Moratuwa, which was also my alma mater.
He was a loyal old boy of the college, an active member of its OBA, as well as a live-wire of the college teachers’ guild for many years. During his period of tenure, he served the college administration without any fear.
Albert was the college OBA treasurer for over 15 years continuously, and also its vice president, the teachers’ guild president and treasurer, a welfare society member, and also served in almost all committees in various capacities. In all projects organized by the OBA to raise funds for the college, he was the person who was entrusted with the responsibility of handling large sums of monies collected from the public.
I remember well that at several carnivals organized to raise funds, he was there at the office until late hours. In whatever capacity he worked, he gave his best while performing his duties.
Albert, who was always smartly dressed in immaculate white, was one of the earliest to arrive and commence work, patiently and silently. Likewise, he was the last to return home after work, often after 5 p.m. His integrity and dedication to the work entrusted to him was unique. He never looked for positions or perks, but performed his duties, leaving no loopholes.
He gave his wholehearted co-operation to all the Rev. directors under whom he worked. Albert Fernando was one who always stood by the La Sallian Brothers. My association with him began from my school days and I can proudly say that he never uttered a word to hurt the feelings of others and was courteous and kind to all those who came seeking his assistance.
May his soul rest in peace in the presence of his maker.

Tribute
Emmanuel Cecil Sandrasegara
Charming centenary
I am delighted to send my greetings and congratulations to dearest Emmanuel Cecil Sandrasegara of Mathagal, Jaffna, born on January 24, 1918, who celebrated his 100th birthday this year. All his beloved children, grandchildren, great grandchildren, relatives, and friends, both here and abroad, celebrated the God-gifted precious day at the Mount Lavinia Hotel.
Emmanuel's parents, late Muthiah Sandrasegara and late Victoria Chellammah Sandrasegara, both orthodox Catholic parents, were blessed with four sons and two daughters. Emmanuel, as the third son in the family, received the love and affection of all and was everyone's pet.
After completing his secondary education at St. Henry’s College in Illavalai, Emmanuel joined the Bank of Ceylon very early in life and served with exemplary records, retiring in September, 1976, after serving his full term. His honesty, punctuality, and hard work were appreciated by his superiors, who presented him with promotions. He earned the highest respect of his colleagues and juniors. Mathagal is a village in the Jaffna diocese where St. Joseph Vaz preached the word of God and converted many to Christianity. The Catholic inhabitants of the area built a church in honour of St. Anthony there. Emmanuel, having inherited his faith in God from his parents, became deeply religious.
Emmanuel married Mangairkarasy, and they were blessed with a daughter, Ratneswary and two sons; Raveendran and Pullendran. Being a devoted husband and affectionate father, he educated his children and brought them up in the fear of God and instilled in them noble qualities to blossom in their lives. A man of sound character with virtuous qualities, ever cheerful with a pleasant and charming disposition and greeting every one with his radiant smile, he is always there to serve others voluntarily in their needs and never spoke ill of others. He is also talented in entertaining his friends with witty jokes.
His priority in life is to attend all weddings and funerals of friends, relatives, and every known person in the village. His life was not all rosy; he lost his beloved wife, Mangai and his daughter Ratnes, but his faith in God and St. Anthony sustained him through all his trials and tribulations.
Late Augustine Sandrasegara, elder brother of Emmanuel, who was working as government officer in Kayts, often visited our home in Karampon to renew family relationships with my mother, Thangarasam Soosaipillai. In fact, his mother, late Chellammah Sandrasegera, called akka by my mother, brought the marriage proposal for my sister Clinett to Dr. Joe Peter from Green Shade, Mathagal.
As an Extraordinary Eucharistic Minister of Holy Communion from St. Lawrence’s Parish, I was privileged to visit Emmanuel in the Elders' Home in Wellawatte and offer him holy communion on first Fridays.
May the Lord Almighty shower his blessings on Emmanuel and grace him good health and long life!
