Interest free loans for 4,000 students

Tertiary education in non-state degree awarding institutions:
Interest free loans will be granted to 4,000 students who wish to pursue tertiary education in non-state degree awarding institutions.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has instructed the authorities to select candidates for the loan programme from the 2014 and 2015 A/L results.
The proposal initially put forward in the Budget 2017, was approved by the Cabinet this week. The Budget 2017, proposed to initiate an interest free loan facility up to a maximum limit of Rs. 800,000 per student for those who are unable to enter the state universities due to their Z scores.
The loans will be granted by a financial institution. Students are required to repay the loan in instalments after obtaining the degree.
Six degree awarding institutions have come forward with the given criteria to offer degrees. The loan will be available for the subject areas of: Business Management (HRM), Logistic Management, Project Management, Industrial Management, Business Communication, Accounting and Finance, Management Information System, Multimedia, Banking and Finance, Insurance and Risk Management, Regional Science and Planning, Software Engineering, Logistic and Transportation, Art (English), Business Management ,Marketing, Education, Information Technology, IT in Network and Mobile Computing, Medical Science, Medical Science in Acupuncture, Biomedical Science, Psychology, Accounting and Multimedia.
Of the opportunities available, a majority of the places, i.e. 2,600 has been offered by the National School of Business Management (NSBM).
The Government has also chosen the Bank of Ceylon (BOC) as the financial organisation to grant the loan as it was considered to be the least cost option for the government in terms of the interest cost for the scheme.
According to the proposal submitted by the BOC, the loan facility has a four year grace period and eight year repayment period. If the degree programme is limited to three years, the loan amount is Rs. 600,000, the monthly loan instalment to be paid by the student will be Rs. 8,333. After obtaining the degree, the students should repay the loan within eight years. During the 12 year period, the government will pay the interest to the bank.
