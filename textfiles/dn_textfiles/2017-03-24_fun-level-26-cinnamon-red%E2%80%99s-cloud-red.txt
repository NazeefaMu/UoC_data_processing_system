Fun at Level 26 at Cinnamon Red’s Cloud Red

Cinnamon Red’s Level 26 bar and lounge Cloud Red is an ideal spot for a fun night out with friends, colleagues and loved ones. Sprawled across a beautifully decorated terrace with low lighting, plush and comfy sofas and chairs, this bar offers great food – tapas style – and a range of creative concoctions.
With an outstanding view of the bustling city below, this is where fun begins every evening at 5 p.m to the dot, with over 100 diverse flavours.
If it's juices that you crave for, that too is available here. One can pair preferred beverage choice with tapas in the selection.
From prawn wrapped in bacon to salt and pepper calamari, seafood wontons, lamb kofta balls, crab lollipops, cheese toast and to the Red’s special sweet potato fries – the options are delicious and endless.
