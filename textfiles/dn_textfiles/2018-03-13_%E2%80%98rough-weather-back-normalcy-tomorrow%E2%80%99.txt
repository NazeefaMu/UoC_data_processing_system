‘Rough weather back to normalcy tomorrow’

The existing inclement weather in seas and around the country would come back to normal tomorrow, Disaster Management Ministry Secretary Dr. S Amalanathan yesterday said.
He said the low pressure area located to the South of the country is likely to develop further and move towards the Arabian sea and this process would bring the weather to normalcy.
He made these observation at a press conference held at the Ministry Auditorium.
He added that showers or thunder showers with cloudy conditions are expected to continue over most parts of the island and surrounding sea areas.
Meteorological Department Acting Director General Athula Karunanayake said that fairly strong gusty winds up to 45-50 kmph can be expected, particularly over North Centeal Province and in the Galle and Matara districts. He added that the fairly heavy rainfalls of 75-100 mm can be expected in the Southern, Uva and Eastern Provinces and in the Matale and Polonnaruwa districts. He added that there may be temporary localised strong winds during thunder showers.
"The general public is requested to take adequate precautions to minimise damages caused by lightning activity," Karunanayake said.
Fisheries Ministry Additional Director Padmapriya Thisera said that sudden wind up to 70 to 80 kmph and sudden roughness in the sea areas off the coast extending from Mannar to Pottuvil via Colombo and Galle will be high.
He added showers will occur at times in the sea areas around the island. "Fishermen are advised not to venture into these seas during next 36 hours," he said. "Naval communities are requested to be vigilant," he said.
Disaster Management Centre Media Spokesman Pradeep Kodippili also spoke.
