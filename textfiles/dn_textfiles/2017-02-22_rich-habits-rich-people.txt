Rich habits of rich people

Rich people are different. How are they different, though? We’ll talk about the rich habits that will put you on the path to wealth.
Dave Ramsey published a list of twenty things the rich do every day. Actually, this list is twenty-one items long but because of the crap formatting, the second item is mixed in with the first. It’s also worded strangely, and some of the items are repetitive.
Junk Food
“70% of wealthy eat less than 300 junk food calories per day. 97% of poor people eat more than 300 junk food calories per day.”
If you don’t feed yourself well, you don’t feel well, and you can’t think well. And that makes it hard to have the energy and focus to pursue your goals. Eating well can mean lots of different things, Paleo, vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian. Eating poorly is easier to define, and we all know it when we see it. No one thinks cake is healthier than a carrot.
You can drill down into all sorts of minutia when it comes to healthy eating, but the basics are pretty, well, basic! Eat a lot of vegetables, eat a little fruit. Eat plenty of protein and healthy fats. Eliminate refined carbs and keep the slow burning carbs to a minimum if you’re trying to lose weight. It’s really no more complicated than that.
Gambling
“23% of wealthy gamble. 52% of poor people gamble.”
People making less than $13,000 a year spend 9% of their income on lottery tickets. There is a reason the lottery is called the Fool’s Tax. There is nothing wrong with buying the occasional lottery ticket for fun or setting aside a certain amount of money you can afford to lose on a trip to Vegas, but if you’re spending 9% of your income on gambling, you will never be rich.
Singular Goals
“80% of wealthy are focused on accomplishing some single goal. Only 12% of the poor do this.”
Wealthy people have a goal. And not just a vague goal but a clearly defined goal and a plan to achieve it. It’s great that you want to quit your job and start your own business, but if you have no plan of action to make that happen, it’s not really a goal. It’s just a day dream.
For any goal you have, getting out of debt, saving 50% of your income, losing 50 pounds, there is a world of information out there that will show you the steps you need to take to achieve it.
Exercise
“76% of wealthy exercise aerobically four days a week. 23% of poor do this.”
Exercising goes hand in hand with eating well. Regular exercise helps to boost mood and energy. It helps control weight, makes you sleep better, and makes sex better. Exercise is especially important for those of us who have sedentary jobs. Sitting all day is terrible for you, and while exercise doesn’t offset it entirely, it would be worse if you were doing no exercise.
Exercise is like diet; there is no one size fits all. The best exercise is the one you will do so find something you enjoy. Walking is very underated as a form of exercise. Almost anyone can do it, and you don’t need special equipment or a gym membership.
Audio Books
“63% of wealthy listen to audio books during commute to work vs. 5% of poor people.”
Okay, this one is sort of weird, so we’ll put our own spin on it. Listening to something like an audio book or a podcast on your way to work is more benefical than listening to the wacky antics of the 99.5 Morning Zoo.
Listen to something educational (Listen Money Matters) or something inspirational. The point is to use that time to listen to something that will feed your brain rather than listening to morning DJ’s make prank phone calls.
To Do List
“81% of wealthy maintain a to-do list vs. 19% of poor.”
Always make a to-do list before you go to bed at night. It helps keep intrusive thoughts out of your head. “I need to remember to cancel my dentist appointment. I need to call the bank about that odd charge on my credit card.” You don’t want to lay in bed thinking about stuff like that. Writing it down gets it out of your mind.
Here is a neat trick that works for me. If I know the following day is going to be a rough one, I write down even tiny things on my list like, “eat breakfast, drop that letter in the post box.” That way, I get to cross them off my list, and it gives me a little boost of feeling accomplished. Sounds silly but try it.
Non-Fiction
“63% of wealthy parents make their children read two or more non-fiction books a month vs. 3% of poor.”
I think this goes back to using free time to educate yourself. I prefer non-fiction and always have, but I think there is something to be learned from nearly anything you read, even if it’s just learning a new word. The trick to enjoying non-fiction is to find a subject that you’re really interested in and dive in. Reading non-fiction often becomes a rabbit hole because one book tends to lead to the next. As long as you’re reading something, I’m happy.
Volunteer
“70% of wealthy parents make their children volunteer 10 hours or more a month vs. 3% of poor.”
Ramsey doesn’t elaborate on these, so I had to interpret this one too. Volunteering is proven to increase happiness. And it’s happiness that didn’t cost anything. That’s a valuable lesson, that you don’t have to spend money to be happy.
Volunteering is also a good way to make connections that might help you in the future. It can help teach social skills and gives you a sense of purpose. It can also give you perspective. No matter how sad you are, you aren’t as sad as a puppy in a shelter waiting for a forever home. No matter how big your problems are, they will pale in comparison to a little kid in the hospital waiting for a kidney transplant. But you helped the puppy and you helped the little kid by giving your time and that’s something to feel good about.
Happy Birthday!
80% of wealthy make Happy Birthday calls vs. 11% of poor.
This one probably has to do with having close social relationships. People who have connections to other people are happier, and when you’re happy, you’re more successful. Remembering birthdays of those close to you is an important way to foster relationships. We’ve all had a friend or loved one forget our birthday, and it hurts.
Write Down Goals
“67% of wealthy write down their goals vs. 17% of poor.”
It’s proven that if you write down your goals, you are more likely to achieve them. The act of writing things down helps to keep them in the forefront of our minds. Take it a step further and break down your goals into things you can do today, this week, this month, and this year to reach them. How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time. Writing down each bite makes things more manageable.
If your goal is to save $500 in a month, today you can make coffee at home rather than buying it on the way to the office. For the week, you can bring your lunch to work. For the month, you can become a cord cutter and get rid of cable, research a cheaper phone plan, and sell three items just sitting around your house on eBay. Write down the goals and the steps to get there.
Read
“88% of wealthy read 30 minutes or more each day for education or career reasons vs. 2% of poor.”
The reading thing is getting a little repetitive but the point stands, reading is important. If you want the most bang for your buck, read a book that will teach you something. Maybe you want to learn to be rich or how to Master Mint.
Bite Your Tongue
“6% of wealthy say what’s on their mind vs. 69% of poor.”
Sometimes it pays to bite your tongue. Boss being a dick? Don’t call your boss a dick. Customer making unreasonable demands? Don’t tell the customer to get bent. It’s important to pick your battles. Sometimes you just have to eat shit. Have you ever had a friend with a temper who was always getting fired? This is likely the reason. They called the boss a dick and told the customer to get bent.
