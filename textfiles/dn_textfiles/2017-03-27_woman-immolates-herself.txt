Woman immolates herself

 A 71-year-old woman had committed suicide by setting fire herself outside a kitchen of a Home for Elders at Uuraniya, Mahiyanganaya.
The woman had died in the Mahiyanganaya Base Hospital on March 20 while undergoing treatment. She was found burning outside the kitchen of Sri Sambodhi Home for Elders by neighbours and rushed to the Uuraniya divisional hospital and later she was transferred to the Mahiyanganaya Base Hospital.
The warden of the elders’ home said the woman was in her usual happy mood that morning and even engaged in religious activities with a fellow inmate.
