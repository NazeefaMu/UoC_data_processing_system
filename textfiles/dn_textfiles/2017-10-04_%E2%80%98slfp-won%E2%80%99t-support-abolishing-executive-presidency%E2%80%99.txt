‘SLFP won’t support abolishing Executive Presidency’

Ishara Mudugamuwa
Science Technology and Research State Minister Lakshman Seneviratne yesterday said the SLFP would not support the abolition of the Executive Presidency.
The State Minister made this observation at a media conference held at the Industrial Technology Institute.
Explaining his party’s stand on the much-debated Executive Presidency, the State Minister said the SLFP would not support the abolition of the Executive Presidency.
“The Central Committee of the SLFP has unanimously taken a decision not to support any move to abolish the Executive Presidency. So no member of the SLFP can go beyond the decision of the party’s Central Committee,” he said.
Although President Maithripala Sirisena promised to abolish the Executive Presidency during his election campaign, the abolition of the Executive Presidency will affect the unity of the country, State Minister Seneviratne stressed.
He added that the public should not panic over the place given to Buddhism by the Constitution and under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena, the foremost place given to Buddhism will not change.
