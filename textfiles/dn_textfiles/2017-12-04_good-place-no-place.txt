Good place is no place

What place does utopia have in 2017? It is now half a millennium since the word was invented by Thomas More as the name of his imaginary island, located in the New World and visited by the Portuguese sailor Raphael Hythloday, who describes it, in conversation with a fictitious Thomas More, as an exemplary society. Utopia, as More coined it, means “no-place”, the prefix ou in ancient Greek connoting negation, and also “good place”, eu suggesting “well” or “good”. Utopia is nowhere, and if utopian societies can be said to have any defining characteristics, then a lack of existence in the real world is probably one of them.
If utopia is conventionally nowhere, however, then in 2016 it seemed to be everywhere, as Utopia’s quincentenary was celebrated with an array of publications, exhibitions and events. These included numerous academic conferences and books, a year-long festival at Somerset House called UTOPIA 2016: A year of imagination and possibility, and Utopia500, an international project which celebrated utopian thinking as a driver of social change and promoted commemorative events throughout the year. This was a good time for writing and thinking about utopia: a utopian moment for utopian studies.
Acrimonious referendum
Yet dystopia (the Greek prefix dus meaning bad or unfavourable) was also ubiquitous in 2016, when the politics of division triumphed: the American election of a climate change-denier as President; Britain’s acrimonious referendum; and the strengthening of nationalist political parties across Europe. These victories seemed to remake the political landscape and made imaginable the possibility of dystopia in our own time. With the immediate future in mind, “dystopias are certainly easier” to imagine, as Ursula Le Guin writes in an essay on utopian fiction, published last year in a new edition of More’s Utopia, introduced by China Miéville and produced in conjunction with the Somerset House festival.
This has not always been the case. Utopian literature proliferated in the late seventeenth century, for example, in the wake of the Civil War. Writers such as Samuel Hartlib, John Dury and the rest of the Hartlib Circle devoted themselves to imagining idealized institutions such as schools, universities and libraries, which would give wider access to knowledge and improve humanity’s capacity to understand the world in which it lived.
There is a direct line between their utopian imaginings – and those of their predecessor Francis Bacon, whose New Atlantis of 1626 projected a utopian scientific institution, Salomon’s House – and the development of real institutions such as the Royal Society, founded in 1660.
Seventeenth-century utopian writers often rejected the imaginative trappings of utopian fiction, such as the mythical island and the difficult journey, precisely because they wanted to emphasize the practicality of the ideas they portrayed. They also wanted to be taken seriously; and “utopian” was already a dirty word by that time, used to describe ideas and places that were too good to be true.
Common consent
In literature, as in politics, utopia and dystopia are of course inextricably linked, two sides of the same coin. It was John Stuart Mill who seems to have used the d-word first, during a debate on Irish land tithes in the House of Commons in 1868: Mill suggested that the Conservative government should be called “dystopians, or cacotopians” as “what they appear to favour is too bad to be practicable”.
In Mill’s conception, dystopias and utopias both fail on the grounds of practicality, the one seeming too bad, and the other too good, to be put into action. The word “dystopia” was not widely used until the twentieth century; it seems to have become characteristic of the early twenty-first. By common consent, we live in a dystopian age, and “dystopia”, as Gregory Claeys observes in Dystopia: A natural history, “increasingly defines the spirit of our times”.
Dystopian literature may seem a natural place to turn in the face of international political upheaval: in the first weeks of the Trump administration, as the New York Times reported in January, Nineteen Eighty-four leapt to the top of the Amazon bestseller list, as readers faced with “alternative facts” sought out fictional parallels. There has always been a protectionist element to fictional utopian societies – an interest in building walls and isolating themselves from the wider world – starting with Thomas More’s island of Utopia itself.
There the entrance to the harbour by which the island is accessed is narrow, and protected by invisible rocks, lying beneath the water and making navigation perilous to foreigners.
Significant differences
Utopian societies in literature are often difficult to access, and harder still to join and to participate in as a citizen. Yet there are also significant differences between, say, Trump’s America and More’s Utopia, perhaps the most obvious being that More’s Utopians disdain capitalism and those who covet gold. The Utopians, who use gold to make chamber-pots and slaves’ chains, and mock visitors wearing expensive jewellery, would have no room for Trump Tower.More may have given us the word “utopia”, but he – and his book – are curiously distant from much of the writing on utopia that 2016 produced. The trouble with reading More’s Utopia in search of ideas that might be useful today is that More’s book is so multilayered, jokey and ironic that it is impossible to take it seriously. Miéville’s introduction to the Verso edition insists that the original Utopia is vitally important to modern society: “We can’t do without this book”, he writes, “It gave us a formulation, a concept, we needed”.
“Without utopia”, agrees Rutger Bregman in Utopia for Realists, “we are lost.” But More and Utopia are rather absent in both books, as if their contribution stopped at the production of the concept. The translation reproduced by Verso is the 1901 Cassell’s National Library version, more recently edited by David Price (the translator of the text is not named here).
