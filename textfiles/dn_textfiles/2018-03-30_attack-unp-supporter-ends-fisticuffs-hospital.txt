Attack on UNP supporter ends with fisticuffs at hospital

A tense situation erupted between a group of outsiders and the Dambulla hospital staff over the attack of a UNP supporter in the Dambulla town.
The two parties came to fisticuffs as an argument erupted over the admission of the victim who had been attacked with a Kris knife.
The UNP supporter had been decorating the Dambulla town on Wednesday night (28) to celebrate the swearing in of UNP members to the Dambulla Municipal Council held yesterday (29). It was then that he had been attacked by an SLPP supporter. The man who had suffered serious injuries had been transferred to the Kandy General Hospital for further treatment from Dambulla.
The victim has been identified as Rohana Abeysinghe, the husband of Sumudu Serin Abeysinghe, who was elected as a member of the Dambulla Municipal Council from the UNP. She was to take oaths yesterday.The attack had taken place at around 10 pm on Wednesday night and the victim, his son and a few others had been rushed to the hospital.Staff at the hospital speaking to the Daily News said two persons had beaten two minor staffers before a doctor.
They had beaten the staff alleging that they had not registered the patient’s name when he was admitted to the hospital. The two minor staffers were admitted to the Dambulla hospital for treatment.The staff explained that when a patient is in a serious condition, they usually take him straight to the doctor and ward without registering them first and it was during this time that the victim’s friends had attacked them.
The fight resulted in other minor staff engaging in a strike yesterday morning and they stated that they would continue with the strike until the two persons who attacked the minor staff are arrested.
Patients who came to the hospital for treatment started to shout at the strikers and asked that they sort out matters among themselves without inconveniencing the patients. They also asked that the minor staff find fault at their own security department instead of launching strikes.
Dambulla Police, Police Inspector Sampath Wickramaratne who arrived at the scene informed the staff that they had already arrested the son of the victim and another person over the alleged attack, in addition to the person who attacked the victim with the Kris knife, along with the weapon.
The minor staff, however, asked the police to bring the arrested persons before them and produce them before the Judicial Medical Officer. However, the Inspector assured them that he would act in accordance with the law and that he had no right to present arrested persons before other people.
Eyewitnesses to the attack on the Abeysinghe informed the Daily News that they saw the victim and five others hanging flags at the Dambulla Economic Centre when the brother of an SLPP candidate who won the election came up to him. They had both had a friendly conversation and when Abeysinghe turned around to cross the road, the attacker had followed him and struck him with his knife from the back. Sumudu Abeysinghe said the attack had occurred when her husband and friends had gone to decorate the city in preparation for her swearing in the next day.Sources within the Dambulla Police stated that the attack had occurred as a result of an argument that ensued between Abeysinghe and the incumbent SLPP member of the Dambulla Municipal Council, Priyantha Kumara. The Police have arrested Kumara’s brother as the main suspect in this case.The hospital staff recounting the incident.
