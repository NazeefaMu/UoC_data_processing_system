Five hundred dialysis units in service before year-end

Dialysis units will be increased up to 500 by year end. A methodical treatment system commenced for kidney patients after the Government came into power in 2015, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
He was addressing the gathering after ceremonially launching the construction work of the China-Sri Lanka Friendship Kidney Hospital in Polonnaruwa recently.
The Minister said that this would be the largest kidney hospital in South Asia. The treatment at the hospital will commence in 2020. Rs. 12,000 million will be spent on the project.
Minister Senaratne said the hospital will have 200 beds, 100 dialysis machines and modern high tech medical equipment. Discussions were held with an Indian company to install another 900 dialysis machines.
Minister Senaratne said that mobile dialysis clinics will be conducted in affected areas. He thanked the Chinese Government for assisting kidney patients in the North central Province of Sri Lanka.
