Latest addition Donald confident of Lanka’s chances

Former South African fast bowler Allan Donald, the latest recruitment to the ever increasing support staff that Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) is feeding the national team is of the opinion that the Lankan bowling attack has in them what it takes to win the ICC Champions Trophy in England in June.
“This Champions Trophy tournament is brutal because if you make a mistake you could be out in the next. I believe this Sri Lankan attack has got what it takes to win this tournament - a lot of skills a lot of leadership with the ball and a lot of leadership within the team, so what is there to scared of?” asked Donald at his initial media conference held at SLC headquarters yesterday.
SLC has tapped Donald for the tournament to work with the national team for two months to make use of his vast experience of English conditions.
Donald toured England on several occasions in his 12-year career and had a stint with English county Warwickshire as player and coach and was also one time England bowling coach.
“Playing in England is a different challenge especially in June where the 2014 experience for me it was very cold. Win the toss and bowl first. The best condition to bat is to bat second,” said Donald. “But it doesn’t really matter to me. The big thing that matters is the attitude towards what you do. You can go to any country in the world and I’ve played in the subcontinent a lot. It is how you embrace the conditions you play in, it doesn’t matter how you can bowl at 128ks or 150ks the attitude still stays the same.
“Adapting to conditions in June using those two white balls properly is going to be absolutely crucial. The lengths has got to be a lot more fuller as the wickets tend to be a touch on the slow side during that time of the year. Playing at the Oval where there is a little bit more bounce and a little bit more carry is going to be good for all the sides. How we hammer those lengths and handle the power play is going to be very crucial. You have to be very patient bowling Test match lengths, a touch fuller and getting people playing,” he said.
Working with youngsters
Donald stated that it was not working with the national team but also with those below them that attracted him towards accepting the offer made to him by SLC.
“One of my first projects tomorrow is working with emerging young fast bowlers 10-11 of them from 2-4 pm. I will also work with the other fast bowling coaches. It’s the grass roots level where we can make a difference,” said Donald. “For me it’s an opportunity to work with the international team. It gets the best out of me as coach and also what I can throw on the table with my experience. That’s what attracted me to accept this offer.”
Donald stated that it’s not for him to come to Sri Lanka and take over the Lankan bowling coaching, but more of an inspirational role.
“We got bowling coaches in charge and I am looking forward to working with him and Fordie (head coach Graham Ford) and to make sure we do the right things,” said Donald.
“For me the next couple of weeks are to get to know the squad better, the personalities form, what they need in terms of fast bowling and what their goals are. I’ve worked four years with a quality bowling attack in South Africa and still I didn’t know where my place was.
“For me to understand the individuals and understand very quickly from a personal point of view, tactical point of view and health is what they need. I see my role as an inspirational one,” he said.
Fantastic opportunity to coach
Donald said that he was very privileged to be in Sri Lanka and from a coaching capacity “a fantastic opportunity to work with a very talented group of players and a coaching group that is going to the UK.
“I have been privileged enough to play under Fordie who was national coach for South Africa. I understand how he works and also his patience and his calm way of doing things on and off the field. I am looking forward to this challenge of working with him,” said Donald.
Paying a tribute to a former pupil Ford said, “It’s wonderful to have somebody of Allan’s caliber involved. The bowlers are very fortunate to have some very good bowling coaches in the system already. They have done a lot of good work and you’ve seen the progress that the young fast bowling brigade has made. Now for Allan to add his expertise, he’s coached a number of international teams, he’s coached in the IPL and he’s played cricket at the highest level, to have him pass on his knowledge is a huge advantage for our young bowling group and even for the older bowlers.
“For me it’s comforting to know that he is back. I like to see the old young Allan Donald running in and bowling. I am confident that he is going to make a big difference to the group.”
SLC president Thilanga Sumathipala said that Donald was brought in to strengthen the resources of the national team towards winning the Champions trophy.
“We had lengthy discussions with head coach Graham Ford and head of international cricket Jayantha Dharmadasa and the cricket committee and we were of the view we needed to strengthen every possible angle to secure our national team’s performances,” said Sumathipala. “We are constructively planning to lay our hands on the Champions Trophy, and areas of concern have to be addressed that’s why we got someone of Donald’s caliber.”
Donald will be the third South African in the nine-man resources team announced by SLC yesterday. Ford and Nic Pothas the fielding coach (although he is of Greek origin) are the others.
The Resource team comprises: Asanka Gurusinha – Team Manager, Ranjith Fernando – Tour Manager, Graham Ford – Head Coach, Allan Donald – Consultant Fast Bowling Coach, Nic Pothas – Fielding Coach, Nick Lee – Trainer, Ajantha Wattegama – Physiotherapist, Sriram Somayajula – Analyst, Rohan Priyadharshana – Masseur.
