Mentally unstable intruder at Court complex

An intruder dressed in a black sarong alleged to be mentally unstable, broke into the Panadura High Court Complex on August 23.
Security had not been provided by Panadura Police to the back gate of the Court complex. A Police Sub Inspector attached to the Panadura High Court Security had seen the person come rushing in and had chased him out of the premises.
The litigants at the Court premises had been shocked to see the intruder. Panadura Provincial High Court Judge Padmini Ranawaka Gunatileke had directed Panadura Police to provide enough security to the Court premises since early this year, it was reported.
