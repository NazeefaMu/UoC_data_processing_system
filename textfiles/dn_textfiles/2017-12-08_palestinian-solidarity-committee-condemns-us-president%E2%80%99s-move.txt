Palestinian Solidarity Committee condemns US President’s move

The Sri Lanka Committee for Solidarity with Palestinian People has condemned the decision by US President Donald Trump to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of the state of Israel.
The US President has also expressed his decision to relocate the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Sri Lanka Committee for Solidarity with Palestinian People co-chairman Imtiaz Bakeer Markar said that “by this announcement, the US President has killed the peace process. Besides, the U.S. now lacks moral standing to play the role of an honest broker in the Middle East peace initiative.”
“We strongly believe that a two-state solution is possible only within the framework of justice, with East Jerusalem as the “eternal capital” of Palestine,” Markar said in a statement.
The committee has called on the US President to to withdraw his announcement and redouble efforts to bring freedom, justice and peace to the holy land so that the Palestinians, both the Muslims and Christians, and the Israelis could live in peace and harmony.
