Dambulla Hospital ETU lacks staff

A high number of patients come to the Dambulla Weera Densil Kobbekaduwa Hospital daily seeking treatment but the Emergency Treatment Unit (ETU) at the hospital provides its service only for six hours per day.
Therefore many patients who visit the hospital undergo severe difficulties since they have to return many a time to consult doctors. The unit was opened 15 years ago and in its initial stage, it was open for 12 hours. However, the duration was cut short since the unit lacks enough staff, hospital sources said.
Hospital welfare society sources said that if the unit works systematically, the number of patients admitted to the hospital can be reduced. The hospital management said the shortage of doctors and nurses results in reducing the number of hours that the unit opens.
The Welfare Association sources said relevant authorities must take steps to extend the number of hours that the unit opens per day as soon as possible since the issue causes severe difficulties to the public.
