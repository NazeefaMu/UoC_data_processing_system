Warnapura dislocates shoulder - out of match: Aussies in driving seat after impressive second day

 
The touring Australian side had every reason to be happy with their performance on the second day of their 3-day practice match against a Sri Lanka Board President’s XI when they batted themselves into a strong position from which they can push for victory on the final day at the P Sara Oval.

Resuming at their overnight score of 127 for one wicket Australia ended the day on 431-9 to lead the home side by 202 runs. The Board team made 229 in their first innings and face an uphill task of saving the match having to probably bat out the entire third day.
Their chances of doing that have already been handicapped by the injury to opening bat Madawa Warnapura who has been ruled out of the match with a dislocated left shoulder.
Warnapura dived at short mid wicket to try and stop a shot from Australian captain Steve Smith and in that attempt dislocated his shoulder which was later relocated.
However the local team’s manager cum coach Piyal Wijetunge said that Warnapura would be out for at least three weeks and would take no further part in the match.
In Warnapura’s absence, Wijetunge said that either wicket-keeper batsman Manoj Sarathchandra or Shehan Jayasuriya would open the batting with Oshada Fernando in the second innings.
“We’ll have to see whether Manoj is fit enough to open after having kept wickets for 122 overs, otherwise our second option is to open with Shehan,” said Wijetunge.
Sri Lanka cap Jayasuriya distinguished himself yesterday as a useful off-spinner picking up five Australian wickets for 109 off 29 overs. He was the pick of the home team bowlers even though there some impressive spells from quicks like Vimukthi Perera, Tharaka Gamage and Dasun Shanaka.
If at all the Aussies were unhappy about was that none of their batters went onto make a big score. Top scorer for them was opener Joe Burns with 72 while Steve Smith (57), Adam Voges (43) and later in the day Steve O’Keefe (62 n.o.) and Mitchell Starc (45) helped themselves to some useful runs to boost the total beyond the 400-run mark.
“The one disappointment to come out of the day was all our batters spent some time at the crease but no one went on to get a big score,” said Burns at the end of the day.
‘We talked about as a batting group that we try and be patient for long periods on the subcontinent. If they bowl good areas it’s just tough work, tough to score and slow going and you have to be committed to bat all day.
“I thought the opposition bowlers bowled quite well especially because it was a long day and some hot periods. As a batting group we are prepared to bat long hours in the middle. Hopefully we can bat for extended periods during the Test series,” he said.
Burns who scored 72 off 131 balls said that he ready for the Test series. “I felt really good the last few weeks went to Chennai before the tour had plenty of batting under my belt and I am ready to go for the Test series. It’s always nice to get some match experience, transfer what you are doing in the nets to a competitive environment in a first-class game and get as much confidence as possible for the three test matches.”
Burns was confident that Australia can push for a win today especially with the bowling line-up they have.
“Obviously we want to come out tomorrow and try and get a win. The skills our bowlers have - quick and spin bowlers can pose a threat,” said Burns.
“We have a bowling attack that can pose a threat in these conditions with reverse swing or spin. That’s a chance for our group to keep posing to the opposition batters.”
