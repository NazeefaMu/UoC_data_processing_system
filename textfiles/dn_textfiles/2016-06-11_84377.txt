‘No one can split SLFP’

No one or no group will be allowed to split the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and no such action will be tolerated, Petroleum industries Minister Chandima Weerakkody and Higher Education State Minister Mohan Lal Grero said.
They added that the SLFP was a shattered party until 1994 and therefore the party suffered a lot. In accordance with the lessons learnt from the past, no one is allowed to destroy the SLFP.
The ministers were addressing the media yesterday in Colombo.
Minister Weerakkodi said the persons, who crossed over to the SLFP from the UNP are in the front line of the joint opposition.
“If one thinks that a SLFP government can be formed by dividing the party, I dare say that such a person is badly mistaken.If one induces others to split the SLFP, he or she is carrying out a contract of the United National Party (UNP),” he noted.
However, the SLFP will work to form a SLFP government at the next general election, the Minister said. He added that the government is working on creating a people-friendly constitution that is most suitable to the country. Besides, the government is working on strengthening the country’s economy. These are the prime concerns of the government. As pledged by this government, everyone is experiencing freedom and other democratic rights now.
State Minister Grero said the members of the ruling party of the last government were aware that the country was heading towards a severe economic crisis.
“I suppose, that was the very reason for the previous government to go for an early election”
Minister Grero added that the SLFP and UNP members should work cordially with good understanding to take the country forward.
People of the joint opposition should understand that protecting the government is none other than protecting the SLFP.
He added that economic sanctions would have been imposed on the country if the good governance government did not come to power.
“The formation of the Good Governance government is not an attempt by the UNP or the SLFP to prop up or subjugate each other but to work for the common good of the nation and its people,” Western Province Chief Minister Isura Dewapriya said.
“However, there should be a proper mechanism to create a SLFP led government by 2020 by winning the next General Election,” the Chief Minister said.
