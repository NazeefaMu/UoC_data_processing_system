SL’s women representation lowest in Asian region: Dr. Saravanamuttu

Sri Lanka has one of the lowest of figures in the Asian region and world when it comes to women representation in politics and decision making in public affairs. The backbone of our economy is women who work in tea estates, in the garment sector and Middle East, Executive Director of the Centre for Policy Alternative (CPA) Dr. Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu said.Addressing a press conference at the BMICH in Colombo yesterday, Dr. Saravanamuttu said that Rwanda is one country with the highest women's representation in politics at national level in Parliament. Rwanda faced a civil war and it was the women who played a key role in bringing the country together. Therefore, it is very important that women representation in National politics and decision making level be increased, he said.
“We have to increase women representation in politics at Local Government level and later at Provincial Council level and in Parliament. But bringing in more women into politics would not change politics overnight. Both men and women come from one society”, he said.
The Local Governance Unit of the Centre for Policy Alternatives (CPA) has conducted 39 District discussions / dialogues in 13 districts covering the Southern, Uva, Eastern and Northern Provinces with considerable support from District Secretariats and Women Development Officers (WDOs) attached to the Women and Child Affairs Ministry in each of the respective districts. More than 2,000 participants attended these discussions/dialogues, he added. A Senior Researcher attached to the CPA Shriyani Wijesundara said that it was expected to appoint 2,206 women into Local Government bodies through upcoming elections.
