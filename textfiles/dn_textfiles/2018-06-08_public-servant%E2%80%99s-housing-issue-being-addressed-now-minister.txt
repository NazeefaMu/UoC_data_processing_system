Public servant’s housing issue being addressed now - Minister

Public servants are no different to politicians when they are being criticised by the people, Public Administration and Management Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara said yesterday.
He said that the people tend to criticize politicians at the slightest mistake vehemently despite services rendered to the country by them.
“Likewise public servants too are criticised vehemently,” Minister Ranjith Bandara said.
The Minister said these observations during a discussion on the progress of the “Nila Piyasa Housing Scheme” for public servants. He said public servants too are facing a housing issue. He added that after the late Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike attempted to address this issue by way of Summit Flats, no other government had focused attention to the issue thereafter. He said the government was addressing the issue with the Nila Piyasa Housing Scheme.
The first phase of this scheme was initiated in Moneragala and Kelaniya.The next phase will begin on June 12 at Colombo 7.
“This government has done many changes including increasing the salary of public servants, reducing the price of commodities, establishing independent commissions, establishing media freedom and bringing corruption to an end,” Bandara said. “But people criticize the government even for a small mistake. In the same manner public servants are criticized badly.”
He also said but there should be a way to appreciate the public servants too. “This is such a means that the government attempt to encourage the public servants,” Minister Bandara said.
