HEC spreads to previously unaffected regions
Special Unit to tackle issue soon

Highlighting the increase in cases related to the human-elephant conflict (HEC), Anuradhapura Government Agent R.M. Wanninayake told the Daily News that wild elephants had begun to invade areas that were previously unaffected by the HEC. He said the Wildlife Conservation Department had been informed of the situation.
Elephants had also been breaking electric fences and invading regions where the human-elephant conflict was previously prevented, Wanninayake said, and added that several Wildlife officials and farmer organisation representatives involved in agricultural and agrarian development projects had told the District Agriculture Committee that electric fences were restricting the natural habitat of elephants. They had said that the fences were only aggravating the elephants.
Wanninayake said that he had instructed Wildlife officials to remove any unauthorised constructions that would worsen the issue, as well as to prevent illicit activities in forest reserves.
He said that he had requested the Assistant District Wildlife Conservation Director to form a special unit comprised of Wildlife and Civil Security officials in order to combat the human-elephant conflict.
Dr. Pruthiviraj Fernando, Chairman of the Conservation Research Centre; a non-governmental organisation focusing on issues related to the HEC; said that the efforts of Wildlife officials had been futile for the past 75 years.
He said that elephant cows and calves were easier to drive away than the males and added that according to the research conducted at the centre, around 70 percent of wild elephants were living outside of forest reservations.
Driving away elephants with firearms and crackers was not an efficient long-term strategy, Fernando said.
