Moving towards a cashless economy

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently urged for a movement to turn his country into a cashless society. Its main advantage, he said, is that a record of all economic transactions through electronic means makes it almost impossible to sustain black market or underground economy.
He asked young people to become the “soldiers of change” in turning India into a cashless economy.
But India is not the only country in the world, and certainly not the first, to make the big move to becoming cashless. This is a global trend, countries both in the developed and developing economies, are making great strides in eliminating or minimising the use of paper money. These countries are not cashless, in the true sense of the word – some cash still does the rounds. So, as some economists believe, less-cash countries may be the more accurate description.
Why are the Governments of many countries moving in favour of moving to cashless systems? The reasons are the same everywhere – cash trails are hard to trace, leaving doors open for frauds, corruption and burglary. As cash permits anonymity in transactions, it leaves a vacuum open for tax evasion and even funding low-cost terrorism.
Sri Lankan stand
What is the official stand of Sri Lanka on digitalisation of the economy? Few months ago, Telecommunications and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando said on the side-lines at #2030NOW, that Sri Lanka is on the process of digitisation, where innovative technologies are transforming national infrastructure to kick start the economy. He also revealed that by early 2017, the Household Transfer Management (HTM) card system will be launched which will digitise the whole platform from financial transaction to all data.
However, in Sri Lanka, technology wise, things move at a slower pace. It is said that the lack of enterprise and archaic regulations are hindering the growth of the digital economy.
What exactly is a cashless economy? In simple terms, it means most of the transaction will be done by digital means like e banking, debit and credit cards, PoS (point of sales) machines, digital wallets etc.
Theoretically, no liquid money or paper currency will be used by the people in a given country. In reality, it never happens. Take the top seven cashless countries in the world: Singapore (61%) -Netherlands – (60%) France- (59%) – Sweden - (59%) Canada (57%) - Belgium (56%) -United Kingdom (52%). Within brackets, you find the percentage of cashless transactions.
In a cashless economy, a third party will be in possession of your money. That party can be the Government or a public or private sector bank who will allow you to transact that money whenever it is needed.
There are a number of other advantages of cashless society to the country and citizens both.
Convenience: The ease of conducting financial transactions is probably the biggest motivator to go digital. You will no longer need to carry wads of cash, plastic cards, or even queue up for ATM withdrawals. It’s also a safer and easier spending option when you are travelling.
Financial inclusion: Digital economy will help to enhance the country’s current banking system. There will be increased access to credit for people who did not fall in any banking network. Financial inclusion will help reduce poverty.
Boost in consumption: There would be no incentive for people keeping extra money in the bank. Therefore, most of them would invest on short and medium term portfolios. It will help to boost economy creating jobs and increasing the income level of people.
Security and convenience: Another benefit is security and convenience. You don’t have to carry a wallet with money in it. You just use your mobile phone or credit/debit card for transaction. It is very hassle free and already going on in urban areas of the country.
But there are drawbacks also.
Higher risk of identity theft: The biggest fear is the risk of identity theft. Since we are culturally not attuned to digital transactions, even well-educated people run the risk of falling into phishing traps. With the rising incidence of online fraud, the risk of hacking will only grow as more people hop on to the digital platform.
Difficult for not-so-tech-savvy: The practical difficulty of going digital, a bigger block is the psychological shift. You are suddenly jumping three generations to the digital medium. It’s a problem for the older people, and people from remote areas who are not at all savvy in technology. They may suddenly find themselves locked. As time goes on, they will pick up the strands.
Our internet penetration is well above South Asian standards with over six million internet users. Our financial inclusion record also surpasses the South Asian standards. According to the Global Financial Inclusion Indicators (Global Findex) 80 % of households in our country have access to financial institutions, at least for loans and savings. However, there is still more work to be done to expand financial inclusion among women and the poorest households.
Even with all such plus points, it will not be easy for our economic sector to become cashless, and particularly the informal sector is likely to be affected the most because of its general preference for cash transactions. Small-time merchants prefer not to keep records for their own reasons and buyers who patronise them find cash payments more convenient.
However, during the past decade, the digital transactions became widespread in Sri Lanka and the banking sector had been rolling-out more and more digitalised services. As a result, cashless transactions have gone up in recent times. For instance, mobile wallets have seen notable attraction, and it is possible that a large number of Sri Lankans have moved straight from cash to mobile wallets.
A material transition to a cashless economy will depend on a number of factors. First, the availability and quality of telecom network will play an important role. Second, banks and related service providers will have to constantly invest in technology in order to improve security and ease of transaction.
People will only shift when it’s easier, certain and safe to make cashless transactions. Third, the government will also need to play its part. It will have to find ways to incentivize cashless transactions and discourage cash payments.
Another important factor is the perception of consumers. This perception needs to be changed by educating extensively about the security and convenience of digital transactions.
Government’s role
What can be done by the Government to discourage the extensive use of cash by people?
(1) Promote mobile wallets which allows users to instantly send money, pay bills, recharge mobiles, book movie tickets, send physical and e-gifts both online and offline, (2) Promote e-commerce by liberalizing the norms for this sector, (3) Withdraw or liberalise surcharge, service charge on cards and digital payments, (4) Encourage and incentivise opening of Bank accounts and ensure they are operationalized, (5) Abolish government fees on credit card transactions; reduction of interchange fee on card transactions; increase in taxes on ATM withdrawals, (6) Tax rebates for consumers and for merchants who adopt electronic payments, (7) Make Electronic payment infrastructure completely safe and secure so that incidents of Cybercrimes could be minimized and people develop faith in electronic payment system, (8) Create a culture of saving and faith in financial system among the rural poor.
The regulators also need to keep a sharp eye on any potential restrictive practices that banks may indulge in to maintain their current dominance over the lucrative payments business.
Future
Let us have a 5-7 year plan to reach 50 per cent of our total citizen transactions cashless or digital. Starting from urban areas, different trajectories need to be planned for migration to cashless for those having bank account and for those not having. Rushing the economy into a cashless state without proper planning and infrastructure will be disastrous and its consequences will last for a long period.
The world has become borderless. As a result, societies are becoming paperless. As money as a means of payment has evolved along history, and in the past decades it has become less physical and more digital, it seems then “money´s final destiny is to become digital”.
