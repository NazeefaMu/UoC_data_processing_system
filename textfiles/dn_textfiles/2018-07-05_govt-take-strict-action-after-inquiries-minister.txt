State Minister Vijayakala Maheswaran’s statements:
Govt to take strict action after inquiries: Minister

The government will take strict action against State Minister Vijayakala Maheswaran once inquiries have been concluded, said Co-Cabinet spokesperson Minister Rajitha Senaratne, yesterday.
Addressing the weekly Cabinet media briefing at the Parliament Complex, the minister stressed that both the Prime Minister and President would ensure that action is taken.
“No matter the issues, she cannot be excused for making such a statement. If there are problems in her electorate, she can discuss them at the Parliamentary group meetings and not make such statements promoting terrorism,” he said.
It is true that there were fewer crimes committed by the ordinary people during the time of the LTTE, but that was because the LTTE made for it by committing horrendous crimes and the people were too afraid to do anything, added the minister.
Minister Senaratne stressed that both statements of asking for a ‘Hitler styled regime’ as well as asking to ‘bring back the LTTE’ were equally bad.
The Attorney General is to advise the government on possible legal action which could be taken against the State Minister, said Minister Senaratne.
Co-Cabinet Minister Gayantha Karunathilake, meanwhile said all MPs when entering Parliament have to take an oath to not promote terrorism and in that context, the State Minister had committed a serious crime. He also pointed out that it was the government MP, S.M. Marikar who had brought it up in Parliament and not the opposition. Minister Karunathilake pointed out that the party had distanced itself from the State Minister’s comments and did not approve her actions.
