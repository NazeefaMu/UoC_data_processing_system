Jesus’ teachings enlighten our lives - Amaratunge

We celebrate the dawn of Christmas, which fills hearts of Christians with peace and happiness, said Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Minister John Amaratunge in a Christmas message.
The message added: "The intention of the true Christian is to celebrate Christmas by highlighting the great humanity with the love and kindness of Jesus. Christmas encourages us to nurture our lives as a loving citizen, achieving the true spirit of Christianity by dispelling vicious thoughts.
"Jesus is the teacher who was born in a Manger. He was committed to helping the poor people with kind words, love and compassion. Moreover, following the way of Jesus’ lifestyle will enlighten the life of a Christian.
"The aim of our government is to provide the joys of Christmas to all citizens alike. It is clear that the meaning of national development and true reconciliation highlighted by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is similar to that. Hence, as Christians, we should commit ourselves to performing our social responsibilities as citizens to all humanity with the love under the affection of Jesus.
Wish you all strength and courage to celebrate Christmas as citizens that spreads and shares peace in the family and spreads love to your neighbours.
Wish you all a merry Christmas!
