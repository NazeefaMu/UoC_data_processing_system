League concludes at intense pace

I am very impressed with the quality on display and the levels the players have achieved this season...as it takes a huge effort with player impact injuries and local recovery. Nutrition, weight manage and rehabilitation time to deliver a season.
The driving facts - all players need to recover, improve and beef up for the next knockout rugby…island style!
Progression is all about getting your plan delivered on the day ...in the middle
Senior players can make the fundamental difference to everything you do as a squad. Surviving the season inside the dressing room - another skill that demands consistency.
Kandy’s remarkable victory ...taking the league by storm and guarding that unbeaten title ... played 14… Won 14...
Unique and worthy of much praise. 545 points for and 145 against ...chairman Lasantha Wijeysuriya, manager Kapila ...
coach Sean Wijeysinghe, asst coach Nalaka Weerakody ...ground chief Arafat ...making up the team behind their top success. The celebrations planned for April with a glitzy banquet in Kandy. ....sponsors Cargill’s, Singer and Etisalat underwriting the talent pool, also a critical factor in a system that runs itself.
The Win: Win mentality is growing and thriving ...and long may its platform steady its progress.
The club is well set and should now scale comfortably to the next level. The ideal investment installing floodlights and creating the upgrade to a fully functional rugby stadium… what pride for Kandy and the Nittawela folk....there will be much to crow about the numbers and the boom in local economics ...10,000 people per Saturday creates its own tunnel city...makes it the SCG of the hill Capitol.
There is such an opportunity to create two amazing stadium communities around the Havelocks and Nittawela rugby gladiator arenas. Town planners could recreate the entire façade ... the racecourse a perfect clinical working example.
The rugby radar lines up mentions for the full team at thepapare.com ...growing the need to share sport on the digital platform ...Ganeesha David, Saabir Cader, Hiran Weerakody and team.
The multitasking team at Sports Today with their hardworking Pradeep Ranchagoda at the helm is fast achieving sports hub status, on social media, plus a colourful glossy magazine take home that gives depth to players and sport island wide.
Anusha Bandara has added a telling dimension to rugby reminders and pictures on Facebook...especially for rugby hearts like herself ...well done and much success to your passion for the game.
The schools season looms and much praise for the vision that still ensures Singer’s magnanimous partnership...that is the SLSRFA lifeline and its future across the island. The 7s gave S. Thomas’ a great morale boosting win over the mighty Isipatana, a final which could have swung either way till the last 3 mins ... the win gave STC rugby a fair step for the league season just around the corner. Coach Lagga will have to instill more work rate, and some hard graft, in the Thora forwards to last the season and challenge the bastions, at Royal, St Peter’s, Trinity, Isipatana,..etc. Singer’s schools division 1 is a massive crowd puller and lessons for all sport and sporting institutions Sri Lanka wide ...let’s hope the committee are able to grow the format and create more interest in the north, the east and southern provinces this season.
The knockouts loom in 2 weeks ...the players rest ... recover ..injury manage, rehab, and recharge the mind ....a vital factor in the quest for renewed high performance and work rate, in the next round for clubs. All told the gladiators run out again, and the hunger, separating the warrior from the soldier.
The reality of survival for clubs is not a theory ...its stark and needs careful scrutiny beyond convention. My old club CH & FC - home to many household names who boldly stood up across playing arenas, locally and internationally....Saman Jayasinghe, Baratha Hegoda, Apisai Nagata, Ravi Wijeynathan, Rohan Abeykoon, Nazeem Mohamed, Hisham Abdeen, Jude Pillai, Bimal Perera, and Graham Raux…make up a small but impressive bunch of pure rugby warriors…the kind that gave dimension to the game, and played for pride with skills that defied description. The list at CR, Havies, Kandy, Police, Army, Navy and Air Force ...equally impressive and definitely deserves their place in club and Sri Lanka’s rugby history.
I anticipate a masked ball, much glamour and the who’s who of SRi rugby to grace the annual occasion. The union as host would be quite splendid.
Rugby is a true hard gladiator sport in all its disciplines ...and I salute those who stand for its values and principles …its intense and all or nothing for that time in the middle ...we give it our max…we defy science ...we scale past our deepest fears and rely on our inherent strength and courage to survive.
Words are hardly the code ...but the rules matter … respect is the universal language.
Bula bula the union code ...long may it prosper for generations to enjoy.
