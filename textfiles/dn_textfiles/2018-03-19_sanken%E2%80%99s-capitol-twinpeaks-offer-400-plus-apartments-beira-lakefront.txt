Sanken’s Capitol TwinPeaks to offer 400 plus  apartments in Beira Lakefront

Colombo is experiencing a rapid development of skyscrapers, poised to alter the city’s skyline for posterity. In the city’s future, two towers will exemplify the concept of luxury city living through their design, construction, aesthetics, quality and experience, namely, Capitol TwinPeaks.
With Sanken construction progressing ahead of schedule, Capitol TwinPeaks is expected to be ready for occupation by end-2020 in its trendy waterfront location of the Beira Lake in Colombo 2.

The Beira Lake Intervention Area Development Plan which was launched in November 2017, aims to “restore the Beira Lake and turn it into the most scenic asset of Colombo” according to the Ministry of Megapolis and the UDA. The area is transforming into a lifestyle neighborhood replete with dining, recreation, shopping and curated public spaces to make it a sought after and picturesque locality. The Light Rail is also due to make a stop on Navam Mawatha, allowing improved public access. Standing shoulder to shoulder with high profile properties such as Altair, Colombo City Center and the proposed Shangri La, Capitol TwinPeaks will enjoy its true real estate value potential in the years to come.
The twin towers will feature 400 plus apartments consisting of 2, 3, 4 and 5 bedrooms in customizable configurations with unique duplex and penthouse units. Offering an atmosphere of neutral elegance, residents can luxuriate in exclusive amenities such as wining and dining on the 50th level Sky lounge offering spectacular views of the Ocean, Lake, Harbor, Lotus Tower and Port City. A star-lit infinity pool, fully equipped gym with steam and sauna, BBQ areas, Kids Playroom and a Business Centre will be a few features of the Podium on Level 8. The Ground Floor will have 24hr Security with Concierge, Mini-Mart with Pharmacy, Spa & Salon and a cozy Peaks Café. Zen Gardens and green spaces will also adorn the Towers in places to create harmony with nature.
