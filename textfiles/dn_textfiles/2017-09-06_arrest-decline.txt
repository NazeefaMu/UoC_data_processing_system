Arrest this decline

Crisis hit Sri Lanka cricket took another nosedive on Sunday when the national team suffered its first ever ‘whitewash’ on home soil, in a one day series, at the hands of India, to the dismay and consternation of the local cricket fans and all Sri Lankans in general. Sunday's debacle followed the 3-0 ‘whitewash’ in the test series that preceded the one dayers. Much the same fate is expected at today's sole 20-20 fixture, following the serial losses, with India set to sign off on a winning note.
The writing was on the wall when we lost to Bangladesh in a test for the first time and also handed a One Day series defeated by Zimbabwe in the run up to the current Indian series. In another country, the entire cricket management would have handed in their resignations following a debacle of such proportions, but here in Sri Lanka, as is the case with all politicians, the Cricket Board too, which is governed by politicians, will not resign.
True, the knee jerk reaction will be to sack the Board, as once happened in Pakistan, when the entire Cricket administration was asked to step down following a similar crisis. However, sacking the Board is not going to solve the problem, which, experts see as a deep seated malaise encompassing the players, the Board and politics. The players themselves are partly to blame. Playing for the country does not have the same allure and feeling as before. Attracted by filthy lucre, our players give the country second preference to playing in lucrative tournaments abroad. If not how can one explain a player like Lasith Malinga hanging up his test boots at such an early stage in his career to reserve his energies for the Indian Premier League.
The high paying contracts offered to players by the Cricket Board has made many of our cricketers complacent. They care little or nothing for failure, knowing their cup will be full even if one scores a hundred or get out for a duck. Commitment is lacking in players due to the knowledge that they could reap their bounty, come what may. The Board should therefore consider performance based payment to players to force them to display more commitment, instead of long term contracts. This way, we can get the best out of our cricketers. After all, most of our cricketers are backed by sponsors and receive handsome payments for endorsements and guest appearances.
True, one could argue that cricketers have a short shelf life, where the game is concerned, and deserve all the rewards showered on them (most feel that our boys are pampered too much). Also the game has become more demanding in the present day, requiring much sacrifice viz. physical fitness and strenuous regimens to keep oneself in good shape. All this, no doubt, takes a heavy toll on the player, justifying the immense earnings
But one should also see things from the perspective of the fans and the spectators who feel cheated when they are forced to put up with poor performances of the type currently being witnessed. The ugly scenes at Pallekele are but a release of these pent up feelings of the fans. Cricket is today a religion in this country and is followed and adored with religious fervour. The followers want the gods (read players) to deliver as they do gods, at their requests or pleas.
Be that as it may, a master plan should be evolved to raise cricket from the depths it had fallen to at present. The blame games must cease, to begin with. Finger pointing and washing dirty linen in public can only further exacerbate matters. Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera, has, apparently, in a desperate bid called for assistance of past cricketers, coaches, officials etc. to pool in their knowledge to resurrect the game from its current status. These gentlemen, played the game purely for its pleasure, expecting no rewards and are bound to look at things from a different perspective and have ideas on how to lift the game from the present depths. Their inputs should be accepted and acted upon by the authorities.
Schools have been the cradle of national sides in the past and this system should be promoted and nurtured if we are to harvest the cream of the cricketing talent. Whatever happened to our scouting system in the past where past cricketer of repute scoured the outstations to spot talent? In Pakistan, most of the outstanding players and household names today, were picked from the streets by talent spotters and moulded into greatness. Now that the war is a thing of the past, the North and East too should be drawn into the mainstream of national cricket. There certainly will be a countless number of youth, with the necessary physique and other attributes for a cricketer, in the Wanni, who may fit the bill. There may be a Sanath Jayasuriya, Aravinda de Silva and Lasith Malinga in the once war ravaged North, waiting to be picked, and answer the national call.
