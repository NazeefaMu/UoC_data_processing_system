“"I had just come back from the launch of my last novel in Paris, and was feeling quite homesick for French food. So Chef Michel Roth's delicious cooking at Delifrance just hit the spot! Of course there were no snails or frogs' legs, but that's OK. Because I have quite a big garden." said Ashok Ferrey, author of The Ceaseless Chatter of Demons, while Mayor Rosy Senanayake said “as the Mayor of Colombo, I am delighted that Softlogic has taken the initiative to bring down Chef Roth to Sri Lanka. With Sri Lanka positioning itself as a much sought after tourist destination as well as an investment hub, activities such as today’s exemplary culinary demonstration, especially with the presence of a 2 Starred Michelin Chef adds lustre to Colombo’s calendar of events and Social activities”.
