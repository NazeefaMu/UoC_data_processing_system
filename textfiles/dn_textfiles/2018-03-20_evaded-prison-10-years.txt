Evaded prison for 10 years

Ingiriya Police arrested the convict in a robbery case who was evading prison after he was sentenced to a 14-year imprisonment with a fine of Rs. 165,000.
He was found guilty of two indictments of robbery of cash and jewellery valued at Rs. 95,000 from a woman in Ingiriya, after threatening her with a live hand grenade, on October 15, 2004.
The case had been heard 10 years ago in absentia of the accused, Gamage Upul Chandana of Ingiriya, at the Panadura Provincial High Court.
The court could not effect the imprisonment because the accused has been evading arrest for the last 10 years.
However, the Ingiriya Police arrested the accused and produced him before court with a report yesterday.
Panadura High Court Judge Damith Thotawatte March effected the judgement of Case No. 2560/2009 and ordered the Prison officials to hand over the accused to Welikada Prison.
Sgt. Kalubowila of Ingiriya Police produced the accused before court through the Prison officials yesterday.
