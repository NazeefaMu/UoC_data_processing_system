Police defend Ryan Jayalath attempted arrest: Inquiry into conduct of CCD

 
Medical Faculty Students' Action Committee Convener Ryan Jayalath is wanted by the Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) of the Police for forcibly entering the Health Ministry premises and damaging its property, Police Media Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said.
Stating that the CCD would arrest him shortly, Gunasekara however said a separate investigation would be held on the conduct of CCD officials during the attempted arrest of Ryan Jayalath on Thursday at the OPA premises.
A tense situation arose yesterday when the CCD attempted to arrest Ryan Jayalath following an anti-SAITM discussion at the GMOA office located at the OPA building.
It was reported that some of the Police officers were in civvies.
As the crowd gathered at the OPA premises protested, the Police had left without taking Jayalath into custody.
Asked about this incident, Gunasekara said there is an arrest warrant against Jayalath, also stating that the Police could arrest him even without a warrant for the offence of storming into the Health Ministry building.
“However, the conduct of the CCD officers during the incident has also been questionable. Therefore the Police will conduct a separate investigation into it,” he said.
