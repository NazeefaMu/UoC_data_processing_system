MR showed his double standards by meeting Indian Premier

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s double standard is clearly visible by his meeting with the Indian Prime Minister at the Indian House in Colombo Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) National Organiser and Western Provincial Councillor Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said.
He said the former President, who made Wimal Weerawansa to urge the people in the May Day Rally at Galle Face to hoist black flags on the arrival of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, went to meet him with former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
