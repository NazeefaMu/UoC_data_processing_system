Eshan Pieris secures 3rd place in X30 Challenge Cup, Japan

In another exciting performance, young Eshan Peiris was placed 3rd at the X30 Challenge Japan Cup, last Sunday (06) at Mizunami in Japan.
Once again Eshan’s extraordinary performances in Japan did Sri Lanka and his home track, the Sri Lanka Karting Circuit (SLKC) Bandaragama proud as he marked another red-letter-day in Sri Lanka’s motor sports history just a mere three months since he won the Round 3 of the Rotax Max Asian Championship in Malaysia. Making him the first Sri Lankan to win a race in the most competitive Asian go karting championship and firmly placing Sri Lanka on the international karting map.
On Sunday morning, Eshan was off to a great start for his finals at the X30 Challenge having secured fourth position in the pre-finals. During the X30 Challenge Japan Cup finals, Eshan did one better and finished 3rd after snatching the lead midway through what was a very close race. And for good measure, Eshan also set the fastest lap time. y to celebrate on his first foray into racing in Japan.
It is certainly a great boost for local motor-sports and Sri Lanka to see a Sri Lankan go kart driver competing successfully in Japan and have our national flag up on the podium.
This win is even more commendable as Eshan only started racing at the late age of 14 or so. Most go kart champions, who then go on to F1 careers, start at around the age of 8. His success was clearly the result of very hard work, focus, passion and dedication, especially as he is juggling a full racing calendar while pursuing his education at Monash University in Malaysia.
