Railway unions postpone strike

The Railway trade unions have indefinitely postponed their scheduled strike which was to be launched from midnight yesterday to win a number of demands including a salary hike.
A spokesman from the Railway Technicians Trade Union said the decision to temporarily suspend the seven-day strike was made following the written assurance given by Transportand Civil Aviation Ministry SecretaryG. S. Withanage, yesterday.
He said an indefinite strike will be launched if the trade unions do not receive any guarantees from authorities for their three demands including a 12.1 percent salary increment, service allowances and 40-hour service week.
