Starburst candy wrapper gown

A Pennsylvania woman has made a dress from more than 10,000 Starburst candy wrappers given to her by her high school sweetheart-turned-husband.
Emily Seilhamer is an artist and upcycler - meaning she recycles items by creating new things out of them.
The Mount Joy Township woman posted a picture of her dress last week on her Facebook page, Artistry and Upcycling by Emily Seilhamer.
Seilhamer met her husband, Malachi, when he offered her a pack of Starburst, his favourite candy. He kept giving her the candies and once she told him she wanted to make a dress, he started bringing her wrappers, which she divided by their bright colours. Seilhamer tells WPMT-TV that “anyone’s an artist if they’re willing to try.”
No cavities resulted from the making of this dress. The Star
