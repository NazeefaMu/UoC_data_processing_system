Women in Management, IFC launch seventh Professional Career Awards 2017

Women in Management (WIM) and IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, are inviting nominations for the 'Top 50' Professional and Career Women Awards 2017.
Now in its seventh edition, these awards recognize women who inspire others with their successes in career, business, and everyday life.
IFC and WIM work together in Sri Lanka to provide skill-building and training opportunities for women who lead, or work in, micro and small businesses.
This is the third consecutive year that IFC will partner with WIM to host the Professional and Career Women Awards.
Sulochana Segera, Founder/Chairperson of Women in Management, said, "It is fitting that the theme for 2017 is Beyond Parity-Developing Tomorrow's Women Leaders. Sri Lanka is at cross-roads, with many local companies on the verge of evolving their leadership for a new age of equal opportunity. Now in its seventh edition, we want to continue to shine a light on the achievements of Sri Lanka's most remarkable women, which will also help inspire the next generation of women leaders."
Nominations for these awards are open from February 25 to May 30, 2017.
Zahiya Zareer, Head of Mission, Maldivian High Commission in Colombo, Sri Lanka, Sulochana Segera, Founder/Chairperson of Women in Management, Henriette Kolb, Head of the Gender Secretariat at IFC, Dr. Rohantha Athukorala, Chairman of Lanka Sathosa /2017 Panel Judge at the event. 
The awards ceremony will be held on July 14, at the Cinnamon Grand hotel in Colombo. Nominations can be made by visiting www.womeninmanagementawards.org.
Dr. Rohantha Athukorala, Chairman of Lanka Sathosa and a 2017 Panel Judge said, "The WIM top 50 career awards has become one the most respected events in Sri Lanka, attracting the highest number of entries and high-powered professionals as judges."
This year's judges include Amena Arif from IFC, Kumar Samarasinghe from Singer Sri Lanka, Lilamani Benson of Lowe LDB, Nadija Thambiah from John Keells Holdings, Tania Polonnowita Wettimuny from Hellmann Worldwide Logistics, and Farzana Jameel of the President's Counsel.
Women's employment is vital to driving economic growth and development. However, the chances for women to participate in the labor market worldwide remain almost 27 percentage points lower than those for men.
"No country can afford to lose half its talent pool. When female employees are unable to realize their full economic potential, businesses, communities, and economies are affected," said Henriette Kolb, Head of the Gender Secretariat at IFC. "We are proud to continue supporting the work done by WIM through these awards and other training programs to help create new opportunities for women across Sri Lanka."
