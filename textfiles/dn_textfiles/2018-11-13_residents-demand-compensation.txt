Construction of overpass at Thalamporuwa
Residents demand compensation

Residents of Thalamporuwa staged a protest yesterday demanding compensation for the damage caused by the construction work on an overpass in the village.
They said that it had been planned to set up an overpass on the Weeraketiya – Angunakolapelessa road connected to the Matara – Mattala Southern Expressway.
Protesters took to the Weeraketiya – Angunakolapelessa road yesterday, creating a traffic congestion for over an hour before the Hungama Police and Road Development Authority officials arrived at the scene to discuss the matter.
