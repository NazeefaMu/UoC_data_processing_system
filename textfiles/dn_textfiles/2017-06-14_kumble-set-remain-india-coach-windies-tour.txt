Kumble set to remain India coach for Windies tour

New Delhi: Anil Kumble’s term as India coach looks set to be extended until the end of the West Indies tour next month, a top official said Monday.
The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) advertised for a head coach in May with Kumble’s one-year deal due to expire at the end of the Champions Trophy in England this week. -AFP
