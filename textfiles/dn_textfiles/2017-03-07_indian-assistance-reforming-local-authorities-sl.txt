Indian assistance in reforming Local Authorities in SL

Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha was on an official visit to India recently, to study and discuss the performance of Local Authorities in India. The official visit was on the request of the Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Nara Chandrababu Naidu who visited Sri Lanka several months ago.
Musthapha attended events organised by the Chief Minister’s office in Andhra Pradesh and held several discussions with state officers about the Local Governance in the area.
Addressing media Minister Musthapha said, “I got the chance to study the structure of Local Governance in Andhra Pradesh which can be followed in order to overcome the issues pertaining in the Local Governance in Sri Lanka. It includes the manner in which powers should be implemented in a certain Local Authority and how the officers should work accordingly. Though we have long term issues in the Local Governance system in Sri Lanka, none of the officers try to overcome them.”
“The performance of the Indian officers is really appreciable and we Sri Lankans have lot to gain from them. They have their own procedure of delivering a regular service through their institutes. The officers are dedicated and the quality of services rendered by them are high. They pay special attention towards the welfare of the general public including matters regarding public health and controlling the stray dog population,” he said.
During the discussions, the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh promised to offer special training programmes to Sri Lankan state officers in the Local Governance and offer required resource persons to hold these training programmes in Sri Lanka.
The Minister of Human Resource Development Siriniwas Rao, Minister of Municipal Administration & Urban Development, Urban Water Supply and Urban Planning, P. Narayana and several politicians attended the discussion.
The two parties discussed updated issues related to the waste management, public health, introducing smart city, controlling stray dog population and controlling fraud and corruption in Local Government Institutions. It is important to maintain a quality service in Local Authorities, as it is the closest Government Institute to the general public.
