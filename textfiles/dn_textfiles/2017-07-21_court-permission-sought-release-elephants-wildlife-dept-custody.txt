Court permission sought to release elephants in Wildlife Dept custody for processions

Elephant owners whose elephants were taken into the Wildlife Department custody filed a motion in the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court seeking an order to release 21 elephants for them to use the elephants in the upcoming peraheras (processions) yesterday.
The elephants were taken into the custody by the Wildlife Department from the owners claiming that they were possessing them without valid licences.
When the matter came up before Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara, the CID was notified to appear in Courts on July 25 to inquire into the matter. Senior Counsel Ajith Pathirana appearing for several owners of the elephants made the request through a motion.
It is to be considered on next hearing date. Prosecutors had informed Court that 38 illegally caught wild elephant have been taken into Wildlife Department custody following the CID investigation into a massive racket where illegally caught wild elephant calves being sold to third parties.
The prosecutors alleged that the suspect Samarappulige Niraj Roshan alias Ali Roshan was the mastermind behind the racket and that the investigations revealed that suspect was directly involved in selling 39 wild elephants and the captured elephants calves being sold for 15 years.
