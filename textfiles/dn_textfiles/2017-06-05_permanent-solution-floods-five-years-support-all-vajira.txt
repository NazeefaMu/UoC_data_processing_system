Permanent solution for floods in five years with support of all: Vajira

A permanent solution to major floods in the country could be provided within five years if the public and political parties extend their fullest support to the Government during its implementation, Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena said.
The Minister addressing a press conference at Sirikotha yesterday said major floods that occurred in Galle, Matara, Kalutara and Hambantota could be prevented by properly managing the Gin, Nilwala and Kalu Rivers.
He said the construction of six main dams is required for this purpose. These include Maguru, Kukule, Ratnapura, Jasmine, Binghamara and Hulandwa Dams.
Minister Abeywardena said the original plans in this regard were proposed in the 1960s, but nothing has materialised even after the lapse of 60 years. The minister was referring to a report of a feasibility study jointly carried out by an engineering firm in the USA and the then Agriculture, Irrigation, Lands and Power Ministry in Sri Lanka.
“ECI Engineering Ltd., in Colorado was involved in this feasibility study and its report was submitted in 1968. I read this report very carefully and found out that it had rightly predicted the severity of floods and landslides the country recently experienced. It recommended the construction of six dams to avoid this catastrophe which we had failed to do,” Minister Abeywardena said.
He pointed out the proposed dams would also be helpful to provide water for cultivation and several mini hydro power plants.
The Minister said the foundation stone for the Dam in Galle would be laid before April next year, adding that about 400-500 families would have to be evicted for the purpose. “This is to avoid a serious catastrophe in the future. This is the only longstanding solution. I urge the public and political parties not to come up with popular slogans and hamper the implementation of these plans,” he noted.
The minister, observing that the preliminary calculations of economic loss from the recent disaster runs into billions of Rupees, said a survey on its impact on people’s livelihoods has commenced.
