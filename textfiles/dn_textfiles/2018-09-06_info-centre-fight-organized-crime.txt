Info centre to fight organized crime

It has been proposed to set up a South Asian Intellectual Information exchange and coordination centre in Sri Lanka.
The project will be implemented by the South Asian Regional office of the United Nations Office on Drug and Crime. This is set up in an effort to crackdown on organised crimes and enable an exchange of information.
According to the cabinet paper submitted by Public Administration, Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara, an MoU is to be entered into with India, Nepal, Maldives, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Sri Lanka.
