Rs. 600 million to enhance rural economy

Rs. 600 mn has been allocated for Rural Economy Promotion Programme to enhance the rural economy. This programme is implemented in Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Batticaloa, Galle, Mullaitivu, Puttalam, Moneragala, Ratnapura, Kalutara and Matale districts.
The expectation of the Rural Economy Ministry is to minimize poverty through the development of rural infrastructure facilities and livelihood of the rural community. In order to achieve this, attention is drawn to necessary development activities such as construction of rural small bridges and roads, donating drinking water facilities, construction of agricultural wells and construction of public facility centres.
Assistance is given to areas such as providing dairy cattle, poultry generating equipment for various industries, creating self-employments, providing mobile stalls under the Livelihood Development Programme.
Assistance is also given by donating aid for those who are engaged in self-employment in order to provide courage to the entrepreneurs and businessmen who are interested in starting new industries under the Rural Economy Promotion Programme.
The Ministry expects to complete this programme by end of November.
