Southern Railway Contractor helps Kotapola flood affected

China Machinery Import and Export Corporation, the Southern Railway Extension Project main contractor, donated gas cookers, cylinders and regulators to over 200 residents of Kotapola who lost their kitchen equipment to the recent floods.
Kotapola was the worst affected area where over 15 people died and many still remain unaccounted for. Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Rathnayake accepted the equipment from CMC’s Project Manager Wu Fan Yu, Project General Manager Tang Ming and Safety Manager Gu Feng and coordinated the distribution.
