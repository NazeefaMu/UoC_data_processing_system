‘New Constitution, key to lasting  political solution’

A new Constitution was a key requirement for the country to find a lasting political solution to the national question, Tamil National Alliance (TNA) and Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan said yesterday.
Speaking at the TNA May Day rally in Akkaraipattu in Ampara, Sampanthan said a lasting solution to the national question was imperative for the country’s future socio-economic growth.
He noted that the opportunity arisen through the decision made by the two main parties in the country to form a unity government should not be missed to find a lasting solution to the national issue.
The Opposition Leader added that this opportunity should not be missed to propagate peace and reconciliation among all people and uplift the marginalized and the downtrodden in society.
Addressing a large gathering, Samapanthan said the Tamil people should unite if they want to find permanent solutions to the issues they face.
He added that until the Tamil people remain divided, they will face difficulties in finding viable solutions to their problems.
Speaking about development in the North and East, Sampanthan said politicians in the two provinces should work together when taking crucial decisions.
He also called on foreign countries to help develop the North and East economically and create jobs for youths in the two provinces, and uplift the living standards.
TNA parliamentarians, party members and a large crowd were present.
