Gota contravened UGC to allow KDU to start own medical faculty, alleges SB

Former Higher Education Minister S.B.Dissanayake revealed yesterday that former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa had allegedly contravened the University Grants Commission (UGC) to allow the Kotalawala Defence University (KDU) to start its own medical faculty.
“I am personally against the methods that were used to get it approved,”added the minister. Addressing the weekly Cabinet briefing at the Parliamentary Complex,
he said that at the start, the UGC opposed the KDU accepting students to study medicine as the university was not under its direct supervision, “We objected to it.
The UGC made it clear that the KDU had to comply with their regulations before it could approve students to its medical program.
But, Gota had llegedly brought in an Act of Parliament to register it separately.
“It was then contrary to the Sri Lanka Medical Council Act so he went and amended that,” Minister Dissanayake said.
“The SLMC Registrar opposed it at first.The GMOA also remained quiet at that time- did not oppose at all. It all went through smoothly”, explained the minister.
