New Zealand IT qualification - Part study in Sri Lanka

The Computer Power Plus (CPP) a long standing registered New Zealand training institute that is part of a group owned by Whitireia New Zealand & Wellington Institute of Technology (Weltec) has teamed with the New Zealand Academic Centre (NZAC), a company based in Sri Lanka working in collaboration with Pro X New Zealand Ltd and ESSL NZ to provide Sri Lankan students an innovative Information Technology study pathway that allows students to study 6 months in Colombo and then continue in New Zealand with Computer Power Plus making substantial savings.
The programme facilitates students to follow the work study pathway, receive internships, a one year post study-work visa and based on the immigration laws prevalent at that time apply for Permanent Residency(PR) upon finding suitable employment.
Internships are provided by Techcafe, in New Zealand based companies, after the initial 6 months of study in New Zealand, thereby connecting the students to the industry to gain the critical New Zealand work experience. (T & C apply) Students completing the two year diploma will become eligible to apply for a one year post study (open) work visa as published in the INZ website and other publications. Students who secure jobs that meet the qualifying criteria will have the opportunity to apply for further long terms visas in New Zealand including residency.
