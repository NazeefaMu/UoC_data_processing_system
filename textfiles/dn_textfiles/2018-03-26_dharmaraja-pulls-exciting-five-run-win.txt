A fine performance in the last few overs enabled Dharmaraja College to register a close five-run win over traditional rivals Kingswood College in the annual limited overs game played for the Winston Hoole trophy at the Pallekelle Stadium yesterday.
Kingswood buckled under pressure after being in a position to win when they required just five runs to win with 11 balls remaining to be dismissed for 209 chasing 215 for victory.
Rajans won the toss and electing to bat first ran up a score of 214-7 in 50 overs. Openers Sachinhta Senanayake and Kasun Gunawardene gave them a good start with an opening stand of 41 after which one down batsman Dulaj Bandara contributed a valuable 67 with seven fours. Opening bowler Uthpala Jayalath bowled a good line and length to take three wickets.
Kingwood in their turn started slowly and were well in control of the chase until the final overs when they lost their way.
