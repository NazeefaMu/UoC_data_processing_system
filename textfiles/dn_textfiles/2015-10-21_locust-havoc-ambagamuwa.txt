Locust havoc in Ambagamuwa

A fast spreading spotted locust species causing destruction to the leaves of coconut, arecanut, havaringu and plantain trees is causing great problems and inconvenience to farmers and other cultivators in the Ambagamuwa Divisional Secretariat Division in the Nuwara Eliya district.
Nearly 25 acres in the Hagaratenna and Jambugastenna areas have been affected by the locust menace, said Vidulupra agricultural instructor N.P.B. Herath.
This menace was experienced in the area several years ago. Herath said since the locust feasts on the leaves of the trees at higher elevation, the crops drop in quality and quantity. He said cultivators should contact the Central Province Agriculture Department for assistance and action if they are faced with this problem.
