Blockage on Whatsapp to be removed by midnight today

 
Restrictions placed on the social media platform, Whatsapp would be removed by midnight today, said Secretary to the President, Austin Fernando.
The Whatsapp messaging service was partially restricted with the sharing of multimedia, videos and calls being banned on the platform since March 7.
This is the second social media platform to have the ban revoked with Tuesday night having the ban on Viber repealed.
Social media sites like Facebook and Instagram however continue to have the ban imposed.
