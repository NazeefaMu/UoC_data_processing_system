Stray cattle  disrupt traffic

Stray cattle had disrupted traffic in the Tissamaharama area, recently. Cattle had been invading the Debarawewa town and weekly polas in the area in search of food.
Residents said that authorities had been silent regarding the matter, even though several complaints had been made in the past. The pradeshiya sabhas in the area should capture such stray cattle and bring their owners to book, they added.
