Future Automobiles launches Ford Quick-Lane Service

Ford Motor Company, represented in Sri Lanka by Future Automobiles (Pvt) Limited, a subsidiary of Softlogic Holdings PLC, has introduced the Ford Quick-Lane Service to speed up vehicle servicing at the Ford Centre in Battaramulla.
The Ford Quick-Lane Service allows Ford customers with prior appointments to drop off their vehicles and get it serviced in a maximum time period of 45 minutes. It consists of two additional service bays that focuses strictly on providing a highly-efficient vehicle service to Ford customers thereby minimising the time they have to spend away from their busy schedules when getting their vehicles serviced. The main Ford workshop which is at the same location will continue to operate at full capacity with a renewed emphasis on general repairs. Elaborating on the Quick-Lane Service, Chamath Tennekoon - CEO of Future Automobiles stated, “With Ford's footprint in the Sri Lankan market rapidly increasing, there is naturally an increase in the number of vehicles that come in for regular service. Therefore, we felt that in order to provide the best service delivery standards to our valued customers, we need to ensure that those who come for regular services get a super-efficient service resulting in quick turnaround.
With the newly-launched Ford Quick-Lane Service, this has become a reality and feedback from our customers have been excellent.”
Ford's heritage in Sri Lanka is almost as rich as the local automotive industry itself. With Ford entering the market in 2010, Sri Lankan customers have been quick to notice that Ford cars have set the standards in terms of safety, fuel efficiency, built quality and innovation. The Ford showroom in Sri Lanka currently includes the nameplates Fiesta(Sedan Car),the Kuga(SUV),EcoSport (SUV) and Everest (7-Seat SUV) as well as the Ranger Double Cab.
