Impact of the Buddha’s words

About 2380 year back a valiant king of our beloved Motherland was on a happy hunting spree close to the summit of Mihintale rock. “Tissa Tissa,” said a voice. King Devanampiya Tissa was puzzled. Maybe he was angry at being called by his given name.
Those hallowed words were to be the auspicious spring of a new era, which would engulf Lanka with the Teachings of one of the noblest and Enlightened who walked this earth.
A gracious and repentant king abandons his deer killing pastime, throws his bow and arrow and becomes the first Lankan to embrace the teachings of Gautama Buddha, made known to him by Mahinda, the son of one of the noblest kings who had ruled on this earth. King Asoka was an invincible monarch and conqueror, who practically took over most parts of Bharath and Mongolia. This was about 200 years after the Buddha attained Nirvana.
After the famous battle of Kalinga, King Asoka upon seeing the massacred human beings threw his weapons of death down and sought the words of the Enlightened one. H. G. Wells, in his epic ‘Outlines of world history’ calls him the greatest monarch of the world who walked this earth preaching and living through example the Teachings of his Master. He led others into the beautiful path of tolerance. His immortal edicts have been enshrined in the Ashok Chakra in the hallowed Indian National flag. It was this sagacious King who sent his beloved son Mahinda on that memorable Poson Full Moon day to our land. History was made that day. This everlasting happening took place 236 years after the passing away of the Buddha and about 300 years before another revered Teacher preached his words on Love, forgiveness, humility and the wages of greed and peace. He was Jesus Christ.
May I as a follower of Jesus Christ, in a little gem of an island where more than 70% are Buddhists, share my thoughts as a Christian, on this lovely day on the impact the words of Gautama Buddha have had in our country.
The Buddha walked on this earth for eighty years and preached for about forty years. He visited our blessed land three times. He left his footprint on the summit of a mountain. Thousands of simple devout followers of Gautama Buddha visit this hallowed shrine between the full moon Poyas of Duruthu and Vesak. I was privileged to trek up to the summit, pay my respects to the Holy Footprint, ring the bell once and see the awe-inspiring ‘ira sevaya’ or sunrise. There were six happy Catholics in the ‘naday’. All of us simulated the walk of our Jesus Christ up to the summit of Mount Calvary.
When we reached the summit we felt that both our celestial Teachers were there to welcome us.
The Buddha spoke on the five noble precepts that are for all time. He said that man was his own decider of his destiny. He has to paddle his own canoe to the final destination, which could be determined only by his actions. Yes! He said, “Do not do to others what you do not wish to be done to yourself”. Years later, Jesus said “He that is without sin let him cast the first stone” when a woman in sin was brought before Him by the hypocritical Jewish elite.
The Buddha said “Thanahathi Jayathi Shoka” - sorrow is always behind greed. How true. This beautiful saying has also been mentioned by Jesus Christ when he said: “It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of Heaven”. We have seen how prophetic and through provoking words these sayings are when we go down memory lane.
I believe in the existence God. He gave us a conscience, a free will to know right and wrong. He gave us Celestial Teachers to guide us towards Nirvana. Once, a very high ranking church dignitary said. (quote) “You know son, it is the fragrance of the Buddha’s teachings that has made this country to be resplendent as a tolerant, compassionate Nation with smiling citizens.”
We have been exposed to the sublime teachings of the Buddha that have made this land a veritable Garden of Eden.
