Research Scholars call for hi-tech rapid composting solution for waste management

Research Scholars of the Kelaniya University, Kothalawala Defence University,Sabaragamuwa University and Cordinating Secretariat for Science, Technology and Innovation (COSTI) are of the view that Sri Lanka needs a hi-tech rapid composting solution along with proper integrated mechanism to manage issues arising from Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) collection process and to achieve sustainable development goals.
“Following a request made by the Central Environment Authority (CEA) Chairman, a research was conducted to identify the best waste management system suitable for Sri Lanka and it was identified that the High-Tech Japanese Solution (ESR) as the best solution for the country’s waste management issue. The report was submitted to the CEA before a year go,but measures have yet been taken for its implementation,” said the Director and the Coordinator of the Research Centre for Social Sciences of the University of Kelaniya Social Sciences Faculty Prof. M.G.Kularatne.
He was addressing the media at the Government Information Department yesterday.
Prof. Kularatne said the government has not yet been identified the most efficient and effective waste management system suitable for the country.
“The University and the CEA has no authority to implement this system and the relevant government authorities should take measures to implement this. This could be implemented as public private partnership project,” he said.
Prof. Kularatne said that it was essential to have an integrated waste management system supported by modern technological innovation to address the issue. The proposed ESR is based on a patented microbial and mechanical process in a controlled and closed environment. This technology has also been in successfully operating since 1994 in many countries such as India, Japan, China, Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam and Indonesia.
ESR converts waste in to compost in 24 hours while other composting technologies need a minimum 6-10 weeks. Space utilisation for the large-scale machinery is just four perches, no effluents, no smell with no bearing on the public.The ESR system can operate anywhere in Sri Lanka. It can be used for solid, liquid any other waste dis[osal.ESR solutions are scalable and available in many capacities from 1 MT to 100 MT per day.
