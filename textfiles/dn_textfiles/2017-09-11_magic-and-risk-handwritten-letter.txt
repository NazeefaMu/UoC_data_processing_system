Magic and risk of a handwritten letter

‘Guten Tag,’ I say to Herr Schroeder when I meet him. ‘Tag,’ he nods his head and smiles vaguely. Herr Schroeder is our postman. Although I don’t often speak to him, he is the only person I see every day.
Herr Schroeder collects stamps. ‘Keep me any interesting ones, especially those new, Croatian, ones,’ he says. ‘Just leave them for me on top of your postbox.’
And I do, almost lovingly.

It is perhaps the obvious thing, to point to the materiality of the letter: how it’s written on paper, maybe folded and slid into a stamped envelope and sent par avion. But that materiality, in an era of email and text messages, has become the essential quality of the medium.
In “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,” Walter Benjamin considers how the modern capacity for reproduction affected original artworks, or rather, our (mediated) perception of those originals: “Even in the most perfect reproduction, one thing is lacking: the here and now of the work of art—its unique existence in a particular place. It is this unique existence—and nothing else—that bears the mark of the history to which the work has been subject.” It is hard to say what constitutes the “original” in email correspondence, which exists in multiple forms: in drafts, inboxes, and sent folders, cc’d and bcc’d, so on and so forth. But the handwritten letter does have all the ingredients that make an original: a singular “here and now,” a “unique existence in a particular place.”
Letters on paper bear the mark of history. They show the trace of touch in fingerprints and coffee stains. And countless readings render scars in brittle paper, unfolded and folded up again.
Diminutive dimensions
I have a letter like that, from my 7th grade boyfriend. He wrote it out on a piece of lined and 3-hole punched notebook paper and folded it into a tiny square no larger than a quarter, so small that another fold would not have been possible. But despite these diminutive dimensions and the decades that divide the moment he wrote this epistle from our present, I still have this letter. I’ve moved often in the years since receipt—from Los Angeles to New York to Prague to Ann Arbor to Berlin to Austin and back to New York—and that little letter is not lost. Its folded corners are now nothing at all, just holes where the corners used to be. A few summers ago, newly thirty and moving again, I came across the letter and for the first time wondered about a white-out mark on the outside surface, hiding something from that younger me.
In that moment of consuming curiosity, I took a kitchen knife and scraped at that blotch of white-out, until I could make out what was written underneath: “I [heart] U.” At 30, I had the same reaction I imagine I would have had in the 7th grade were I so forensically inclined then. Really?! I think. He loves me?! Well, loved me. And maybe not really loved me. After all, he has drawn the symbol in lieu of the word, the (pre-Emoji era) universal middle school jargon for going steady, nothing more, nothing less. But still . . . it is somehow a flattering discovery. A moment of blushing transpires. I wonder whatever happened to Jesse Taylor. Rereading his letter, I am reminded that he was kind and funny, and the first in a string of boyfriends who could not spell to save his life. I patch together a few blurry memories of this person with whom I shared a brief past; I am lost in a cloud of nostalgia in my kitchen, knife in one hand, letter in the other.
