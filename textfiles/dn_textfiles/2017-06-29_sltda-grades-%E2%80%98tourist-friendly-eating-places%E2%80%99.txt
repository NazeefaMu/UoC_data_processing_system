SLTDA grades ‘Tourist Friendly Eating Places’

Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLDA), in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and Colombo Municipal Council launched a project to encourage the upgrading of food safety, hygiene and service of eating places supplying food for foreign and local tourists.
The project is named “Certification Scheme for Tourist Friendly Eating Places”. SLTDA is planning to expand this project, initially launched within the Colombo Municipality limits but aims to cover suburbs of Colombo soon. Under the second phase of the project, eating places in Kandy and Galle will be certified.
The SLTDA began inspection visits May 2017, to eating places in Colombo. Based upon the inspection scores, 25 eating places in Colombo Municipal Council area were selected for the certification. The two types of certification are granted in these places with ‘A’ and ‘B’ grades.The Certification awarding ceremony was held on June 27th , at Monara Restaurant, Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management under the patronage of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Minister John A.E. Amaratunga.
“If we are to sustain the growth of our tourism industry, it is extremely important that we offer quality food and beverage services for tourists. SLTDA’s currently ongoing project of certifying Tourist Friendly Eating Places is a step in the right direction in this regard. While some Sri Lankan restaurants are among the best in the world having won international recognition, there is the other end of the spectrum which is not up to the mark. We have to raise the standards of these places,” said Minister Amaratunga highlighting the need for certification and standardization of tourism related services.
“Sri Lanka Tourism industry has progressed dramatically over five decades to receive an all-time high hit of 2 million annual tourist arrivals at the end of 2016, said Paddy Withana, Chairman of Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority.
