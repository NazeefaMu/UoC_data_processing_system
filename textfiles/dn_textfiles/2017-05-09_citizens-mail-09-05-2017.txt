UNCALLED FOR WASTE OF NATURE'S RESOURCES
Recently I got a gift of a slab of chocolate from Greece, which had travelled through the Mideast and yet had not melted one bit when opened here, though it was wrapped ONLY in the well sealed outer covering, bearing the name, logo and other details of the chocolate, in multi colour. There was no inner wrap of gold or silver paper. How sensible!
We too could follow this in all our locally manufactured chocolates, thus eliminating unnecessary waste of forex, saving trees and also reducing our garbage disposal woes. Actually the government should make it mandatory, that there be no useless extra coverings for products. All culprits should be severely punished.
There are some powdered milk packets and biscuit packets which have no cardboard (paper) boxes as outer coverings. These packets are nitrogen - flushed and very well sealed to ensure quality, and safety from contamination from insects and other vermin. The cardboard box and also the outer wrap of chocolates are promptly thrown away as they are opened! Paper is made from trees. Therefore hundreds of trees can be saved if the government makes it mandatory that such unconscionable waste of precious resources of Nature, are stopped immediately by business institutions. Even the dyes etc which are used to print the “blurbs” on the outer coverings are imported, and therefore a total waste of foreign exchange. The Meethotamulla disaster should make the government think “laterally” also, so that unnecessary waste of Mother Nature's resources are eliminated by puny, and stupid, and greedy mankind, before she wakes up and very rightly punishes us without mercy.
