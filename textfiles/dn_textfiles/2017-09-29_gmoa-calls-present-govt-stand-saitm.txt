GMOA calls to present govt stand on SAITM

The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) has sent a letter to the President requesting him to order the Attorney General to present the Government stance on SAITM to the Supreme Court as agreed, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said although it was agreed to present the Government stand on SAITM (declared on April 7) to the Supreme Court, the official lawyer from the Attorney General's Department did not do it yesterday and did the opposite.
This lawyer believes that the facts that are relevant and important for the people's rights do not include in the Supreme Court case and whatever state decisions do not matter or relevant for the Supreme Court case, Dr. Aluthge said.
This lawyer should present April 7 Government's declaration (stand on SAITM) to the Supreme Court immediately and the GMOA asked the President to intervene and get it done through the Attorney General's Department, Dr. Aluthge added.
