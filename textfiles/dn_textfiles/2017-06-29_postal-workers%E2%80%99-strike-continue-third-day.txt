Postal workers’ strike to continue for the third day

The strike launched by postal workers will continue for the third consecutive day today, the Joint Postal Trade Unions Front said.
According to Union Co-Convenor Chinthaka Bandara, the decision to continue with the strike was made following failed discussions between union representatives and Posts and Postal Services Minister Abdul Haleem yesterday. “The minister didn't provide an acceptable solution during the discussion," Bandara said adding that a committee chaired by Secretary to the Prime Minister, Saman Ekanayake has been appointed to look into the matter.
According to Bandara, the employees will continue the strike until a favourable response is received by the committee. The strike action by the Joint Postal Trade Unions Front with the support of 24 other postal trade unions is based on three main demands.
Workers are demanding to halt the redevelopment plan to convert the Nuwara-Eeliya, Kandy and Galle Fort Post Offices to profit making ventures while seeking for the reopening of the former General Post Office building in Colombo on Janadhipathi Mawatha. They also seek solutions to administrative issues faced by the staff due to a circular issued in 2006.
Meanwhile, Posts and Postal Services Minister Abdul Haleem has promised to ensure the functioning of the department as usual within two days. The ministry will resolve the issues soon,” the minister said.
