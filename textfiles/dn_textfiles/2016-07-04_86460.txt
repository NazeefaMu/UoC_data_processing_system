Royal stuns Thomians to earn final spot

Invincible Royal College Colombo dished out a superb brand of rugby to shock everyone who were present at the Royal Sports Complex, Reid Avenue where they came from behind 0-7 down to beat the Singer inter-school league rugby runners up S. Thomas’ College Mount Lavinia by 24 points (3 tries, 3 conversions, 1 penalty) to 15 (2 tries, 1 conversion, 1 penalty) in their Milo inter-school ‘A’ Division President trophy knock out rugby semi-final played yesterday. The scores were deadlocked 10-all at half time.
This victory by Royal was one of the best executions by an underdog team which is a tribute to their master tactician head coach Sanath Martis and his assistant Dushanth Lewke for laying out a superb plan which in the end, saw them outwit the far more superior Thomians.
The match got off to a fabulous start where S. Thomas’ drew first blood in the fifth minute when off a three quarter move their second row forward Wayne Mack forming the overlap crashed through for a try near the left corner flag. Centre Ashwantha Herath made a difficult touchline conversion for S Thomas’ to go into a 7- nil lead.
Within a couple of minutes Royal fly half Ovin Askey opened scoring through a 30-meter penalty to cut down the lead to 7-3.
In the 26th minute off a rolling maul Royal vice-captain and scrum half Ashoke Wijeykumar broke from the base of the scrum and dummied his way through several Thomian defenders to touch down for a brilliant try mid right. Askey made the conversion and Royal went into a 10-7 lead.
Afterwards S. Thomas’ centre Herath slotted a 30-meter penalty in the 34th minute of play to equal the scores 10-all at lemons.
Soon after resumption in the 50th minute Royal went into the lead again when off a rolling maul their try scoring architect hooker Azmir Fajudeen scored far left. Askey made the simple conversion and the score read 17-10 in favour of Royal. In the 57th minute Royal scored once more, when captain cum prop forward Nikhila Gunadeera picked up the ball from the back of the ruck and crashed through mid left for a magnificent try.
Askey slotted the conversion to record a 100% kicking accuracy in this match and Royal further extended their lead to 24-10.
After several minutes the Thomians cut down the lead through a try scored by full back Mayon Jayawardena off a three quarter move. Herath fluffed the conversion and the score read 24-15 in Royal’s favour.
There were no further scoring done by both the teams in the final few minutes and hence Royal ran out winners to book a berth in Saturday’s final (July 9) against this year’s inter-schools unbeaten league rugby champions Isipathana College.
