Depletion of ozone layer
Sri Lanka to ratify Kigali Amendment

The Sri Lankan government is to ratify the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol this week at the United Nations General Assembly in New York. President Maithripala Sirisena, who will be declaring the official consent, left for USA to participate in the UN General Assembly last Saturday.
The Kigali Amendment was brought into effect in 2016 to substantially reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases or hydro-fluorocarbons (HFCs) by 2030. The Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol is legally binding and will come into force from January 1, 2019. Around 200 countries have expressed their consent to Kigali Amendments at present.
The Montreal Protocol, which aims to reduce the production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances in order to protect the earth’s threatened ozone layer, came into effect in 1989.
Speaking on the topic, Deputy Environment Minister Ajith Mannapperuma said that the international community has expressed admiration for the Sri Lankan government for being foremost in successfully implementing global environmental policies.
“This government is focused on proper management of limited environmental resources, without which we cannot attain sustainable development.
The conference ‘Sri Lanka Next: A Blue Green Era’ will be held on October 19 and 20 for the third time, under the patronage of President Sirisena, organised by of Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry in line with the world’s interest in controlling climate change,” Deputy Minister Mannapperuma said.
He was speaking at the Ozone Day Celebrations held at the BMICH recently, under the patronage of President Sirisena.
