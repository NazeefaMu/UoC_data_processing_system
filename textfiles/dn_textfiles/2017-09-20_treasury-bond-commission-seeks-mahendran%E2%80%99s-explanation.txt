Treasury Bond Commission seeks Mahendran’s explanation

The Treasury Bond Commission yesterday issued an order on Arjun Mahendran’s two mobile phones which were handed over to the CID for investigations.
According to the order, the examination of two mobile phones provided by Arjun Mahendran suggests that data covering a significant period of time during commission’s mandate cannot be located.
Before proceeding to further investigations, the Commission wished to receive Mahendran’s explanation as to what could have happened.
The Commission made the order after Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda informed the tribunal that certain data are not available in Mahendran’s mobile phones.
