President's US visit will stand in goodstead

President Maithripala Sirisena's visit to New York can make a change in the UN report expected to be released on September 30, Rural Economic Affairs Minister S. B. Dissanayake said
Addressing the Media yesterday at the SLFP headquarters, Minister Dissanayake said a satisfactory decision will be taken with regard to the report on the Investigations on Sri Lanka and matters relating to the domestic inquiry mechanism the government hoping to adopt.
"The UNHRC report is one-sided. The former regime did not leave room for the UN to conduct their investigation in the country. The evidence to the crime report has been given by LTTE supporters. The UN has proposed for a hybrid court and they raised doubts about the functioning of courts in Sri Lanka," he added.
"We believe that President Maithripala Sirisena's visit and the prevailing situation in the country will convince the UN officials to implement a domestic inquiry mechanism," he said.
Dissanayake said that it is the responsibility of the government to protect the rights of the War Heroes who liberated the country and ensure the country's unitary status and sovereignty and at the same time all those who made commitments to save the country should be protected.
The perspective of the international community has been changed after President Maithripala Sirisena took office. The international community including India, UK and USA have shown a positive stance over Sri Lanka. It was a good move to postpone the release of the report to September. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa ended the war but the relationship that prevailed with the neighbouring countries faded. Several countries expressed their objections but the country maintained its independence. Release of UNHRC report was also a reason for Former President Rajapaksa's decision to go for an immediate election, Minister Dissanayake said.
International interference is unwarranted but we expect to work together amending few resolutions that has been proposed, Highways State Minister and SLFP Media Spokesman Dilan Perera said.
Many evidence mentioned in the report are obtained from foreign countries, they are mere facts. It was stated that an Act of Indemnity will be passed in the parliament to protect the soldiers, it is wise to expose to the world that there were no war crimes took place in Sri Lanka. A domestic inquiry will pave the way to solve the problems, he said.
Perera further said that people voted to form a national government, no main party was given an opportunity to form a majority government. Though there were many allegations against the formation of a national government, President Maithripala Sirisena formed the government with a social motive. The country witnessed the value of a national government after the UN report was released. Today the country is ready to face the international community as one nation. TNA leader R. Sampanthan's appointment as the Opposition Leader also in a way has changed the perspective towards our country.
The decision of the international community depends on the stance the powerful countries have on Sri Lanka. The report that was released recently is not the final one, he said. Perera noted that there were allegations that SLFPers were opposing the countries like UK and USA while UNP would go with the pro-American countries. But President Matiripala Sirisena took the leadership in collaboration with both the parties therefore today Sri Lanka has the support of almost all the countries.
