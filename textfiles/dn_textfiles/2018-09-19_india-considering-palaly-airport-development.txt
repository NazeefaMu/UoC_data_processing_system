India considering Palaly airport  development

The state-run airports of India (AAI) had entered into an agreement with the Indian External Affairs Ministry to develop Sri Lanka’s Palaly airport, Indian press reported.
“AAI has signed an agreement with the (Indian) External Affairs Ministry for the preparation of a detailed project report for the development of Palaly airport. Considering AAI’s expertise and capabilities in airport development and operation management, the authority wants to go global,” an AAI source told the Indian publication.
The agreement for Palaly was recently signed by AAI’s Executive Director (Land Management and Business Development) Anil Gupta and Indian External Ministry’s Joint Secretary Sanjay Panda.
