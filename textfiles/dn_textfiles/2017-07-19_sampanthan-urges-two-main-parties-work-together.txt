Sampanthan urges two main parties to work together

For just political solution to national question:
Opposition Leader R.Sampanthan yesterday called for the two main parties to set aside their differences and come together to work out a just political solution for the national question.
Addressing the media after a closed door meeting with the Singaporean Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dr.Vivian Balakrishnan at the Office of the Opposition Leader, Sampanthan stressed, “A just political solution must come, and it is only through that there will be real change in the lives of the people and trust will be rebuilt to live in this country”.
“As long as they fight with each other, this problem will not be solved,”said Sampanthan who discussed the current political climate with the Foreign Minister and asked that the international community support them in this process.
The Opposition Leader had also taken the opportunity to discuss issues related to land, political prisoners, missing persons, livelihoods and employment issues in the North.
“Bring about some development in our region and we will work with you. Our youth especially need to be trained for employment and if you can think of any programme, you can provide them with the acquisition of skills, it would be most useful,”said Sampanthan to Dr. Balakrishnan as the latter presented him with a book titled ‘An Encyclopaedia of the Sri Lankan Diaspora”.
