Sinclair Lewis, American Prophet

It Can’t Happen Here, a 1935 novel about the rise of a fascist government in America has been garnering plenty of attention post-election, but even as it muscles its way onto bestseller lists and inspires think pieces in publications like the New York Times, the man behind the tale remains in the shadows. Sinclair Lewis was one of the most prolific and prominent American authors of the 1920s and 30s. He was the first American to win a Nobel Prize for Literature and turned down a Pulitzer in a fit of pique. It Can’t Happen Here might be the novel in the limelight, but his one-two-three gut punch of Main Street, Babbitt and Elmer Gantry, all written between 1920 and 1927, are more relevant today than they’ve ever been. The man himself deserves to have his reputation as one of America’s finest homegrown satirists restored.
Commercial success
Sinclair Lewis, born in Sauk Centre, MN in 1885, used to be somebody. In addition to the Nobel Prize for Literature and the Pulitzer he rejected in response to being denied it for an earlier work, he was a major commercial success during his lifetime. He sold the first magazine serial rights to his novel Arrowsmith (1925) for $50,000—what his publisher deemed to be the highest price paid for such rights at the time.
Weaker novels
The initial print run of Elmer Gantry (1927) was 140,000 copies. It was the largest first printing of any book at the time. He earned half a million dollars in royalties, serialization fees and movie rights for Cass Timberlane (1945), one of his later and weaker novels. In 1939, Colophon magazine asked readers to name the living American authors they thought people would consider “classics” in the year 2000. Sinclair Lewis topped the list.
This prediction did not come to pass.
Lewis himself wasn’t even dead a decade when Lewis biographer Mark Schorer declared him one of the worst writers in American literature. By 1987, Harold Bloom wrote, “Lewis is of very nearly no interest whatsoever to American literary critics of my own generation and younger, so that it seems likely his decline in renown will continue,” while noting that Lewis had already been surpassed in reputation and acclaim by William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Willa Cather, and Theodore Dreiser. Even Lewis’s own hometown, the aforementioned Sauk Centre, MN, has abandoned him. This past fall, the Sinclair Lewis Interpretative Center, devoted to showcasing the life of the town’s most prominent native son, shut its doors for good. The land is being sold to a developer and is destined to become the site of a new chain store. “You talk to kids in school now, and they either don’t know or don’t care who he is. And it’s not just the kids. I tried to read Main Street. I start it every winter. I still can’t get through that book,” Sarah Morton, Sauk Centre’s city planner told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune.
At first glance, the most common critiques leveled at Lewis’s work are not without merit. His books are dense and sprawling. They’re filled with clever but protracted monologues in the vernacular of the day. If you like Whit Stillman period-piece films built around pithy conversations meant to illuminate social classes or subcultures, you’ll love Sinclair Lewis’s novels.
Most of them lack a coherent, forward-moving plot. Instead, there are loose vignettes or day-in-the-life recountings.
You could easily summarize Babbitt (1922) as “insecure businessman feels as if there is something missing in his life, undertakes several minor intellectual and social rebellions to feel more alive, but is ultimately lead back to conformity by his lack of courage and fear of social and professional ostracism.”
Morally bankrupt
Main Street (1920) would be “ambitious young woman marries, moves to the Midwest, attempts to affect social change through sheer force of will, but ultimately learns to accept the strictures of geography and gender by which she’s bound.” Elmer Gantry is “morally bankrupt sociopath uses religion to manipulate those around him and society at large for his own gain and glorification.” - Lit Hub
