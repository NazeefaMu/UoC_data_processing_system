Army adopts Capstone Doctrine

The Sri Lanka Army added another milestone by releasing its Capstone Doctrine, during a brief ceremony at the Colombo Army Hospital auditorium on Tuesday, presided by Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake.
The ‘Capstone Doctrine’ encompasses theory, history, experimentation and practice and lays down guidelines with which the organisation is expected to function in keeping with ground realities and regional and global developments of the times. It also provides the military with an authoritative body of statements on how military forces conduct operations and provides a common terminology for use by military planners and leaders.
The doctrine, produced by the Army think-tank, Army Training Command (ARTRAC) at Diyatalawa, was initiated by the Army Commander in close collaboration with Senior Officers at the ARTRAC, commanded by Major General Aruna Wanniarachchi.
A comprehensive presentation on the newly-authored ‘Capstone Doctrine’ and how it has been put into words was presented to the audience by ARTRAC Brigadier Strategy and Doctrine Brigadier Nanda Hathurusinghe, who has been one of the heavyweights behind the realisation of the project.
“Today, the Sri Lanka Army reached a new milestone with the Army doctrine compiled with principles and examples from experience and operations. Doctrine is not just what is thought or what is published or what is believed. It is an approved set of principles and methods intended to provide large military organisations with a common outlook and uniform basis for action,” the Army Commander said.
“In the past 30 years, the Army was trained and organised to fight as a professional Army to defeat what we call the most ruthless terrorist organisation in the world. Our practices have become our principles. Our military practices and operations were not based on principles or doctrine. But it was purely on standing order procedures or SOPs. How military activities and operations are directed, mounted, commanded, executed sustained and recovered are covered in the Doctrine,” the Army Commander said.
Chief of Staff Major General Dampath Fernando, Deputy Chief of Staff Major General Ajith Kariyakarawana, and Army Health Services Director General Major General (Dr) Sanjeewa Munasinghe, and senior officers were also present at the event.
