India beat Pakistan in field hockey

LONDON, Sunday: India may well have suffered a 180-rout at the hands of Pakistan in the Champions Trophy cricket final but they came out on tops on the other side of London -- in field hockey.
India ran out 7-1 winners over their old rivals in a World Hockey League fixture at Lee Valley in east London just as Virat Kohli's cricketers were enduring defeat at the Oval in the south of the city, 10 miles (15.7km) away.
Harmanpreet Singh fired home the first goal for India with a double from Talwinder Singh taking the score to 3-0 at half time.
Harmanpreet made it 4-0 early in the third quarter before Akashdeep Singh and Pardeep Mor chipped in.
Shortly after Pakistan’s Muhammad Umar Bhutta netted a consolation goal, India completed the scoring through Akashdeep Singh, who claimed his second of the match.
“I thought Pakistan were the better team in the first quarter and they created more opportunities but after we scored the first goal we started to play according to our plan,” said India coach Roelant Oltmans.
“We scored some great goals and when we score the type of goals that we did today, that is what makes a coach happy.
