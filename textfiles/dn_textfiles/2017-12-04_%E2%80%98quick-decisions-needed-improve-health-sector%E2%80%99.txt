‘Quick decisions needed to improve health sector’

“I did not interfere or politically influence the appointment of the new Health Services Director General, Dr. Anil Jasinghe,” Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, he had no issues during the time of former Health Services Director General Dr. J. M. W. Jayasundara Bandara. After his retirement, Dr. Bandara was appointed as one of the Project Directors of the World Bank.
Minister Senaratne was addressing a gathering after handing over the appointment letter to Dr. Jasinghe.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that decisions should be made quickly in the health sector in order to provide a prompt and smooth service.
“I am working according to a five-year plan. The new Director General and his team should work hard to achieve the planned goals,” he added.
Dr. Anil Jasinghe said that the Sri Lankan health service is a glorious one, and the glory depends on further strengthening and empowering the service. The direction of the State health sector is indicated by providing free heart stents, eye lenses, slashing prices of 48 drugs etc. The advancement of the health sector would be done under the vision and mission of the President and the Health Minister.
Dr. Jasinghe is an old boy of Ananda Collage, Colombo, and a prominent medical administrator. Former Lady Ridgeway Hospital Director Dr. W. K. Wickramasinghe has been appointed as the Acting Director of the National Hospital of Sri Lanka (NHSL).
