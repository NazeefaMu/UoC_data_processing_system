A full-scale squashy war against the mossie posse

Readers have come to know me, I hope, as a kind, live-and-let-live sort who wouldn’t hurt a soul. I know for sure that they don’t view me as a pathological killer. But that’s a false presumption. I now confess to my homicidal ways – the slapping and gassing – and the evil sneer on my face as I smash my enemy into oblivion.
Readers know my enemy. It’s that blasted, bloodsucking creature we call the mosquito. Most you imagine that the pestiferous mosquitoes are fly-by-night creatures which emerge from their hell-hoes when the sun goes down. But there are exceptions such as the Aedes Aegypti which is a day biting mosquito. That means that the varmints are most active during daylight, for approximately two hours after sunrise and several hours before sunset. These parasitic ‘pesquitos’ spread the deadly Dengue fever, Chikungunya, Yellow fever West Nile Virus and Eastern Equine Encephalitis - not to forget the illness and death of past plagues such as Malaria.
Yet both night and day-biters have just two things on their tiny minds - food and sex. Mosquitos can impress potential mates by harmonizing the high-pitched whine of their tiny wings. Now, scientists have discovered how this musical matchmaking helps the insects to pick their perfect partner.
Unfortunately the preferred meal of the female mosquito is blood, and that's where the problems between us and these blasted bugs begin. Yes, I did read somewhere that those infernal mosquitoes have killed more humans on earth than wars. They are the worst creatures on earth, beside humans. If you think you're too small to make a difference, you haven't spent a night with a mosquito. I know one thing for sure and that is that their life sucks. I don’t mind that so much as long as they don’t suck my life blood. My obese friend Sal keeps asking me why they can’t suck fat instead of blood.
Okay, fine, so entomologists tell us that mosquito larvae provide nourishment for fish. Then I say we should dry the pesky little buggers into flaked fish food. Every last one of them, stuffed in cardboard shakers. That would work for me. Nope, I don’t buy any justification for the most annoying creature in the universe. They may be small but are deadly especially if a disease spreader gets under your skin. Did you know there are thousands of species of mosquitoes all over the world? The Antarctica is the only continent on the globe that doesn’t have a mosquito problem. And, worldwide, we have only been able to control them partially. But the problem is that we can’t completely eradicate them.
If they were bigger or I was smaller I’d wring their wiry little necks like a chicken’s if I could. I've also resorted to using a big, industrial fan at the back door, mosquito foggers and those candles in buckets that guarantee to suffocate any mosquito that dares to approach. Maybe all this works. I couldn’t say because I did find some dead mosquitoes in the dog’s water bowl. But the robust ones were holding a prayer meeting around the rim of the candle bucket. I guess they must have liked the ambience.
Actually, it’s the female mosquito that does the damage. According to research on average, a female will live 2-3 weeks, but the male’s lifespan is shorter. Within their lifetime both adult male and female will feed on nectar and plant fluids, but it is only the female that will seek a blood meal. Upon locating a suitable host, the female probes the skin for a blood capillary and then injects a small amount of saliva containing chemicals, which prevent the host’s blood from clotting.
After engorging on the host’s blood, the female will find a resting place to digest her meal and develop eggs before flying off to deposit them in a suitable aquatic habitat. The darn hussy! And sure enough their religion is blood. If they could talk these ‘mossies’ will call you an atheist if you say Dracula doesn’t exist. But I for one won’t stand for some female blood sucker drawing my blood and trying to make her getaway with buzzing lyrics that go: “Yummy, yummy, yummy, I've got blood in my tummy.” I spend an hour chasing the damn thing around my room and return only when I have blood on my hands.
And talk about their promiscuous sex techniques. Turns out, at least for these darned ‘skeeters’, as the Yanks call them, sex is an acrobatic, mid-air event – the flaming aerial exhibitionists! Surely, they can display a shameless flaunting of the dalliance that would have given the expert ‘Kama Sutra’ exponents an inferiority complex with their high-flying jiggery-pokery. I agree with writer Alexis Arguello who said, “When you see a mosquito and you’re able to hit it, you’re able to hit it with a couple of short, sharp shots it’s a beautiful thing.” Actually for the majority of us it’s a great feeling being slap-happy around them and reducing them to bloody pulp, either by chance or sheer skill.
And naturally there’s no better feeling of double joy than swatting them when they are engaged in the process of procreation. It certainly is therapeutic when you start slapping and slashing at the fused couple and liquidate them both with a single thunderous handclap.
And could any theologian explain why the heck old Noah didn’t kill his only pair of ‘mossies’? I’ll bet it was because they kept breeding faster than any other genus in the great deluge and came back to bite every living species on the Ark. The male is not totally innocent though. He has romanced the female, which sends her buzzing off on her ‘Dracularian’ search. So, hey, if you happen to hear a mosquito buzzing around your ear at night don’t buzz back. Just do what I do. Kill ‘em dead!
But the pestilential ‘mossie’ does come in handy when it comes to dealing with certain unbearable humans and can be a pretty good scapegoat to boot when you want to slap someone. All you have to do is slap him hard on the cheek. Then before he could protest yell: “Mosquito!”
