Island of brilliance

Juliet Coombe talks to artist Robert Sedgley whose collection of paintings produced over two decades will be on exhibition at the Lionel Wendt, Colombo from February 19 to 21.
Artist Sedgley’s works of architectural brilliance inspires engagement at every level. He has a hugely diverse range of styles and skills and has thus produced many varied paintings on all kinds of subjects that capture the islands historic treasure.
‘’Architecture has been described as ‘frozen music’ and that is another of its attractions for me. So I conceive my paintings as musical analogies. The whole takes on a symphonic appearance and Sri Lanka is the ultimate score.”
Sedgley who loves to sit for days painting a special spot like the Kandy Lake or Galle Fort ramparts attended Junior Art School in Birmingham from the age of twelve to fifteen; and it was his time there, with its intense ethos of creativity and its sense of the camaraderie and the feeling of being part of a ‘brotherhood’, that he himself first realised that there was nothing else that he could do but be an artist. Amongst the subjects he studied there was lettering, and it is from this intense study of the forms, proportions and spacing of Roman letters that, he asserts, he derives his sense of design and space in his paintings and sculpture. On leaving school he trained as a silkscreen printer, and later worked as a poster writer, meanwhile attending evening classes in life drawing, portraiture and sculpture.
Then, after some six years working at these trades, on the advice of a friend, he decided to retrain as a teacher. Following a degree level course at Birmingham and Exeter colleges of art, and a postgraduate study at Leicester Polytechnic, he worked in and headed up the Art Departments of several Hertfordshire schools.
A permanent move to a small village in Spain led to a lightening of his pallet and more colour in his landscape work and on discovering Sri Lanka recognised it had the same wonderful features. He and Jean first came to Sri Lanka in 1996. From there they made visits to Galle, Nuwara Eliya, Sigiriya, Dambulla cave temples and the ancient city of Polonnaruwa; making his first studies of this exotic country, charmed by the temples and the astonishing green hillsides of the highland tea estates. On a two day trip to Colombo a chance meeting with the artist S. H. Sarath led to his first exhibition, two years later, in the Artist’s Studio. A small exhibition of around twenty studies of buildings and temples, which was well reviewed in the papers, and opened by the then British High Commissioner, Linda Duffield, culminated in an interview on a television chat show.
This was followed by an exhibition, From Holy Sites to Humble Dwellings, at the Sri Lankan Institute of Architects in 2001; where he showed a range of pictures, contrasting building styles in Spain, France, Italy, Uganda and Sri Lanka. Inspired by another journey, this time by a train ride from Kandy to the high, mountain town of Haputale, and utilising methods of mark making first developed in his Road and Bridge watercolours, this series of abstracted landscapes extend the techniques of brush and layered colour.
In the next two years he displayed at the renowned Barefoot Gallery in Bambalapitiya, Street level and Trading Places, which was incredibly popular both with the owners and the audience.
It was a conversation with Barbara’s son, the photographer Dominic Sansoni, that led to the idea of producing a book, which would be designed as a visual record of a journey around the island, with pencil notes of the artist’s impressions and experiences, and backed up with a scholarly text on the history and short articles on the most important buildings and sites. The work of many subsequent visits, Travels with a Paint box, took life. In a book which is not only a personal reminiscence of his travels but also a useful travel guide, the artist presents around two hundred new drawings and paintings, with the text by Dr. K. P. Paranavitana, and a foreword by the late Professor Ashley Halpé.
Inspired by his interest in Eastern religions, he is currently engaged on a large complex and detailed painting with a modern take, entitled The Age of Kali, a destructive goddess, who carries the seeds of ultimate regeneration, which will usher in a new Golden Age.

ROBERT SEDGLEY
Robert Sedgley is a British artist living in Spain. He paints in oils and water colour and makes ceramic sculpture. He makes regular visits to Sri Lanka, where he is well known for his paintings of buildings and historic sites. He has had seven exhibitions in Sri Lanka.
“I have been visiting Sri Lanka since 1998. It is a beautiful country with many temples and varieties of buildings from its colonial past. I am also, in the spirit of portraying the romanic ruin, perhaps, drawn to the many neglected colonial style buildings, defaced by shop signs and air conditioning units, with grass sprouting from the eves which are also part of the townscape, together with rows of ugly newer buildings. In painting these I hope to rescue them from the banal, and the tendency to regard them with horror at the ravages with which time and the unsympathetic accretions of commerce and plumbing have defaced the facades,” Sedgley says.
