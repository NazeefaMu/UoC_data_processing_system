A Glitzy Children's Day

Glitz once again organized a magical day for the children of the Cancer Hospital to celebrate the World Children's Day. The event consisted of a magic show, balloon modeling, entertainers dressed as cartoon characters and distribution of gifts. During this jamboree organized by Glitz, the afflicted children were able to forget their condition and run around, play and enjoy like normal children.
Glitz plans to make this project a highlight of its portfolio of Corporate Social Responsibility activities. The company has already contributed towards a permanent stage at the Cancer Hospital in partnership with the Rotaract club of Panadura to be used for theatrical performances and to showcase the talents of kids.
