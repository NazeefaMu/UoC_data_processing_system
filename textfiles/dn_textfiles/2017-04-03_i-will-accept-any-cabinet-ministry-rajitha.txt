I will accept any Cabinet ministry: Rajitha

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said he would accept any Cabinet ministry no matter what it is because he had experiences of working in several ministries in the past such as construction, engineering, fisheries and health.
Minister was addressing the gathering after opening the new blood transfusion centre at the Vavuniya General Hospital constructed at a cost of Rs. 80 million.
He said he had discussed the referendum with President Maithripala Sirisena before going abroad and a few important decisions had been made. “A solution that can be accepted by all will be given soon,” he said.
The Minister said South Korean President was taken into custody, but she did not commence a hunger strike like some Sri Lankan politicians. “All should obey the country’s law,” he said.
“We should not look at the issue on the Wilpattu National Park from a racist view point. The Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims lived there chased away by the LTTE within 24 hours during the war. They should be allowed to go back and settle down their original homes,” he said.
