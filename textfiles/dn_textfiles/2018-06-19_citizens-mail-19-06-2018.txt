Withholding Tax on Treasury Bills and Repos
This is with reference to a letter from H. B. Ranasinghe which appeared on Daily News of June 6. The correct position for the benefit of the readers is furnished below.
a) Balance Interest Income on Deposits of Senior Citizens (above the exemption limit of Rs. 1.5 million) is taxable at 5% once and for all, at source. It is not added to other Income. In the case of non Senior Citizens, entire interest is taxable at 5% once and for all, at source.
b) With effect from 01.04.2018 Treasury Bills and Repos are not subject to notional tax credit and the entire interest is taxable in the hands of recipients.
National Savings Bank offers the following rates of interest.
Senior Citizens up to the Deposit of 1,500,000 15%, Senior Citizens up to the Deposit of 20,000,000 11.25%, Senior Citizens after the Deposit of 20,000,000 10.50%, Non Senior Citizens on the Deposit of any amount 10.50%
Therefore unless Treasury Bill and Repos interest is above 9-975 (10.50% less 5% tax), no individual will patronize Treasury Bills and Repos in future. At present Treasury Bills and Repos play a major role in Government borrowings. This market will be affected shortly. Hope the Central bank will rectify this situation early.
c) Personal Income tax for 2018/2019 is payable on quarterly basis within 45 days after end of every quarter I.e. 15.08.2018, 15.11.2018, 15.02.2019 and 15.05.2019.
Treasury Bills and Repos are offered for 3 months, 6 months and 1 year. Further Treasury Bill Income is taxable on cash basis. Therefore, the balance outstanding of treasury Bills at the commencement of a quarter could help to compute the interest receivable for the next 3 months. This information could be checked with actual cash received. Double checking is possible.
Any change in Treasury Bill operation (buy or sell) will affect the balance as at quarter end and the Income for next quarter could be computed accurately.
It is true that new tax law is a little complicated, but could be understood. It is suggested that adequate seminars be organised by Chambers and Department of Inland Revenue to educate the public.
