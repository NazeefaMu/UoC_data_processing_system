Liquor seized at BIA

Around 250 bottles of foreign liquor worth more than Rs. 2 million, had been seized by the Excise Department Anti-narcotics Bureau at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake on Sunday (1).
The liquor was allegedly found in the quarters of the Immigration and Emigration Department.
Officials made the detections upon discovering a cleaning supervisor of a private company attempting to sell a liquor bottle.
Speaking to the Daily News, an Anti-narcotics Bureau official said the suspects had collected liquor that had been sold duty-free at the BIA and followed to sell it at a rate of Rs. 3,500 per bottle, while their actual market value was about Rs. 7,000.
The said cleaning supervisor, a security guard and an employee had been arrested.
The Bureau is currently conducting further investigations to assess the involvement of Immigration and Emigration Department officials. The raid was lead by the Officer-in-Charge K. P. S Pathirana.
