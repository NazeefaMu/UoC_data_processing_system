Judge’s wife seeks HRC relief for schoolless child

The Moneragala District Judge’s wife lodged a complaint with the Human Rights Commission on Monday about the failure of the education authorities to provide a suitable school for her child, due to her husband’s transfer.
Speaking to the Daily News Dinithi Kariyawasam said her husband, the Monaragala District Judge, had been transferred from Moneragala to Balapitiya from January 1, 2018. However, despite having applied for admission to Dharmashoka College, she had still not received a response with regard to the admission of her child.
“Its been a month since schools have commenced for the year and my child is still at home without a school. Judges are also transferred periodically, but there is no proper mechanism to ensure proper schooling for our children. My Husband was transferred to the Balapitiya Magistrate’s Court from January 1. We appealed to the Education Director, and applied for the school in November, but still to receive even an acknowledgement to my appeal,” she said.
She lodged a complaint with the Human Rights Commission on Monday and said further measures are being taken regarding her child’s predicament.
