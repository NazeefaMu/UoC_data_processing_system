New Labour Act formulated

The government received Cabinet approval this week to introduce a new Labour Act which would integrate all current labour laws into one.
The Labour Department has thus far implemented 61 Acts in relation to the labour force in the country but only 27 are being practically enforced.
Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister Ravindra Samaraweera submitting a Cabinet paper on the above subject noted that many of these laws had certain discrepancies in them and that the Department faced issues when enforcing them.
Thus a new law has been proposed with all safeguards towards current employee rights ensured.
The new Act would combine the Shop and Office Employees Act, the Wages Board Ordinance, Women, Young Persons and Child Employment Act and the Maternity Benefits Ordinance into one.
The bill on the above proposal was submitted to Parliament and was taken up for debate yesterday.
