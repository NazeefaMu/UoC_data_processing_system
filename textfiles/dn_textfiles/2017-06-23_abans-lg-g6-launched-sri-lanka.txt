Abans LG G6 launched in Sri Lanka

Abans recently launched LG’s latest flagship smartphone, the LG G6, for the first time in Sri Lanka, being the country’s sole authorised distributor for LG electronics.
Hosting exceptional features, this all new range is a stunning upgrade on the conventional smartphone experience that offers a progressive solution to current user needs. Keeping in mind the active lifestyles of consumers today, the LG G6 possesses an ultra slim design that is both elegant and durable at the same time. This smartphone showcases a refined curved back with a full glass, nearly-all screen front that gets rid of those fiddly home screen buttons for added sophistication and convenience.
With two sleek colour options, namely Astro Black and Ice Platinum, the LG G6 perfectly suits the aesthetic preferences of any consumer ranging from business professionals to college students. Plus, the incredible IP68 water-resistance capability function makes the phone not only attractive, but highly durable by allowing the LG G6 to withstand being submerged in 1.5m of water for up to 30 minutes. The LG G6 is also highly resistant against dust and dirt, which steadily assures you that this smartphone will produce an impressive performance over an extended period of time.
The LG G6 demonstrates the latest cutting-edge innovations in smartphone technology specially developed by LG.
Moreover, the LG G6 offers a powerful performance that provides users a totally immersive experience with the all new Snapdragon 821 processor. The LG G6 smartphone range is available for purchase at all Abans and Abans Elite Showrooms island wide.
