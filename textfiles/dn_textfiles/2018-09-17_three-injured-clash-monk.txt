They had clashed over a garbage issue.
Sigiriya police said the constable had visited the temple and alleged that the temple cleaners were dumping garbage to his garden over the fence.
The argument between the two parties ensued a clash and the bhikku has allegedly stabbed the constable, his wife and the brother who came to his aid on hearing the clash.
