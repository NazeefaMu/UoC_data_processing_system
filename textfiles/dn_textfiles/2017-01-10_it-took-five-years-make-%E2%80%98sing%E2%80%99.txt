It took five years to make ‘Sing’

Director Garth Jennings already has a very energetic personality, but having spent five years developing and making the animated movie ‘Sing,’ he admits he’s now just a big ball of nerves leading up to its December 21 release.
“It’s been very emotional, actually, and I don’t use that word lightly,” Jennings recently told Business Insider about showing the movie to preview audiences for the last month.
Known for his music video work in the 1990s, he took on directing the adaptation of a book regarded in the industry as an unmakeable movie, “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy” in 2005, which ended up being a critical dud (though it earned over $100 million at the global box office). Jennings rebounded with the inventive indie “Son of Rambow” in 2007, about two boys obsessed with the first Rambo movie. Since then, he’s been trying to develop an animated movie.
But having never made an animated movie, Jennings was a little naive on how it’s done.
So five years ago Jennings had a meeting with producer Chris Meledandri, the man behind the “Despicable Me” movies and this year’s animated hit ‘The Secret Life of Pets,’ and by the time it ended Jennings agreed to make Meledandri’s next movie.
“Chris just started talking about his thoughts and they just smashed together with my sensibility and my hopes and dreams for making an animated film,” Jennings said.
The idea Meledandri had was for a movie about a shifty theater owner whose only way to save his business is to put on a singing competition to give notice to an unknown talent. And seeing as this was an animated kids’ movie, it would be filled with pop songs and all the characters would be animals. Business Insider
