TPA expert panel to forward suggestions to CC

The Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA) has appointed an expert panel to forward suggestions to the Constitutional Council, Hill Country New Villages Infrastructure and Community Development Minister P. Thigambaram said.
He said the 15 member panel consisting of Tamil intellectuals representing Indian origin Hill-Country Tamils will be chaired by P. Muthulingam.
The panel is supported by several civil society organisations and three political parties. The National Worker's Front, Democratic People's Front and the Kandurata People's Front are the three political parties supporting the panel, Thigambaram said.
The minister addressing the media on Tuesday, said the panel was appointed to forward suggestions to the Constitution Council after considering the needs and requirements of Hill Country Tamils, especially estate employees.
Muthulingam said the panel will forward suggestions to the Constitutional Council within one month for consideration when a new constitution is formed.
"We have decided to highlight our origin as 'Indian Origin Malayaka (Hill country) Tamils' when forwarding suggestions to the Constitutional Council. The panel will forward suggestions based on that identity. We stand for the identity of Indian originality," he said.
Questioned about other areas to be discussed at the panel, Muthulingam said the panel will discuss the power sharing mechanism.
