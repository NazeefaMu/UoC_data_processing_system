Islanders rugby flagship knock-off round

The warm earthy colours of March add much to our island existence and herald the end of our club season and the start of a brand new school competition that promises to redefine the game as we know it.
Rugby in Sri is second to none...it shines bright all year round ...with age group formats that colour players from U10 up...and the apex u20 Singer schools rugby that is our beacon for fans from all corners of this incredible island.
The force is within ...as our Royal v Kingswood opener clearly defined by a full house and max inspiration for the young warriors in the middle....
The defending champions clearly better prepared and match ready...much different to a rusty Kingswood squad...short of finish and a long arduous lung buster season unfolding as we speak.
Each stable has left no stone unturned ....investing heavily on every front ....and pressure on the whole school family to deliver ...its beyond logic and way beyond convention that makes the history, more than fascinating.
Much will be writ about the planning ...or then again it’s simply a matter of unadulterated pride for each stable to muscle up and step right.
Royal and Trinity the hallowed sanctum of elaborate strategy and international budgets to match ......not surprisingly the oldest schools rugby fixture in the world in very good hands and supported all the way by our global multinational Singer plc.
The Bradby Shield is the epitome of all fixtures and fittingly a world feature of our island heritage...its beyond the greatest of examples and is hailed by all ...young and old, Sri islanders, the world over as the most historic annual confrontation to be found on this partially green planet.
The game is certainly flourishing and needs little introduction...if anything, with a global streaming audience of around 3million Sri islanders from home.....The two legs of the shield ...our version of fiesta ...rugby fiesta Sri style island magic.
International 7s opens our warriors up on the Asian stage ...then men looking to win silver ware and the women defending the cup title from 2017...such is our fiery assignment in Borneo...next week.
The men are wild carded for the World Series Hong Kong 7s later this busy March...an unforgiving journey across the China Sea!
Bigger still the Commonwealth Games in sunny Australia, where the Gold Coast host the best and brightest in glorious competition.
Our islanders meet the epitome of 7s and defending Olympic champion...Fiji in the opening match...a baptism of pure fire and less brimstone...hopefully?
What a tantalising opportunity and experience for our lads and a chance to match up.....run against the skill our island brothers carry and stand up to their pressure in the middle.
My memories stark and too intimidating too mention in passing.....always a massive mind shift to play them in any corner of our rugby planet.
Expectations are rife and much anticipation about the quality of our islanders team for the battle listing from March to October.....let's wish the likes of Danushka Ranjan, Ratwatte, Jason and Ritchie fast recovery for the months ahead.
Likely that Muthu will skipper the side and good Auckland 7s experience to carry across Malaysia to Borneo.
Naturally our threat for domination....from Japan, Hong Kong Korea and China ....realities that Sri rugby would like to alter this 2018 season.
Preparation is everything and supreme reliability on fitness and maximum skills ...The only way to progress in Asia for starters!
As rugby fans we are certainly hopeful that this is the year for change ...so let's wish chief Asanga Seneviratne, CEO Priyantha Ekanayake and managing team at Sri HQ...the absolute best for all Asia rugby. Ahead ...it’s a grand task to push up both rankings ...Asian and World....and aim for our best effort this year.
It is imperative we make a mark and earn new respect in the region. Blessings to all who will be guiding and shaping our future ...it’s the challenge that counts and us islanders to the front.
Bula Bula the game and may we stride from strength to skill and pure pace beyond our wildest imagination.
The dream is reality when we score under the posts and defy all odds and form .....USA just did exactly that in Vegas last Sunday to beat Argentina in the World Series final...What a fantastic result and magical opportunities for our future in 7s.
Cheers indeed!
