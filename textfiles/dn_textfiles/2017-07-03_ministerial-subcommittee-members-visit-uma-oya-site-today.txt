Ministerial subcommittee members to visit Uma Oya site today

The ministerial subcommittee appointed by the Cabinet to review the Uma Oya multi-purpose project plan will conduct inspections at the project site as well as hold discussions with the people affected by the project, starting today, Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, a member of the committee said. He further said the subcommittee is to submit a report based on its findings to President Maithripala Sirisena shortly.
In addition to Amaraweera, the subcommittee includes Ministers Patali Champika Ranawaka and Vijith Vijayamuni Zoysa.
“The committee will inspect the project site in the morning. Then we shall have a round of discussions with the people affected by it. If a possibility arises to give solutions to some of the issues faced b the people, we shall do so immediately.” Minister Amaraweera said.
Minister Amaraweera further said responsible officers of the relevant government bodies will also join the inspection.
Meanwhile, Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka speaking at a ceremony held to hand over a Public Entertainment Center constructed by the Urban Development Authority in Kubichchikulam said, it is President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who have to bare the burden of ex-President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s narrow-minded decision making.
“It is but natural to face such environmental hazards when large scale development projects are implemented. When the Bowathenna Tunnel was built and the Kotmale and Samanala Wewa projects initiated, it was the same case scenario. But, the Uma Oya project is a result of imprudent decision making.” Minister Ranawaka said.
“The water from the Uma Oya flowed into Mahaweli River which distributes it to the Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa areas. Rajapaksa wanted to divert this water to Medamulana and Hambantota,” Minister Ranawaka said.
“He did not take any warning into consideration. He gave the project to Iran, four times larger than the project is actually worth. The technology used for the project is unsuitable,”the Minister alleged Minister Ranawaka also said, around eight thousand families in Bandarawela were put at grave risk by the Uma Oya project.
He also said the demonstrations against the present government holding it responsible for the Uma Oya project is completely politically motivated.
