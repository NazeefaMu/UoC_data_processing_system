Cabinet nod for National Audit Bill

 
 The Cabinet of Ministers on Tuesday approved the National Audit Bill. It will be presented to Parliament soon, Public Enterprise Development Deputy Minister Eran Wickramaratne said yesterday.
The deputy minister who addressed the weekly cabinet briefing said this was part of the measures taken by the government to restructure the economy.
“We promised that we would bring an Audit Bill during the elections last year. We have done it," Wickramaratne said.
The National Audit Bill was first presented to the Cabinet in May 2015. It sought to empower the Audit Commission established under the 19th Amendment.
