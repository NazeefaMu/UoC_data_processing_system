SLIBC hosts Central Bank Governor

Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy was the guest speaker at a Breakfast Meeting organized by the Sri Lanka – Italy Business Council (SLIBC) of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, recently.
The Breakfast Meeting was well attended by high ranking officials from the Sri Lankan business community.
The Breakfast Meeting which was held under the topic 'International Monetary Fund (IMF) Monetary Policies on Sri Lanka', commenced with the welcome address by Sri Lanka – Italy Business Council President D. R. P. Abeyasinghe.
President Abeyasinghe mentioned that it is the mandate of the Council to host meetings with eminent speakers on matters relating to trade, economy, infrastructure and policy. Dr. Coomaraswamy who has 30 years of experience in policymaking and providing economic advisory services at national and intergovernmental levels, made the audience aware of the IMF's policies.
He explained in detail, how loans are granted and the monitoring process.
The IMF is funded by taxpayers of the member countries and as they do not require collateral, they have strict procedures to check on the receiving countries on their policies of repayment of the loans.
Dr. Coomaraswamy’s address was followed by an interactive Question and Answer session.
The Breakfast Meeting came to a close with the vote of thanks made by Sri Lanka – Italy Business Council Vice President Anushka Polonowita.
