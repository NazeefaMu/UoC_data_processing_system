This enticing and strikingly modern 24 floor property which officially opened its door on the 16th of this week, will see Swiss Management firm Movenpick Hotels & Resorts introduce a unique hospitality concept that promises boost the morale of the capital.
Set to be a spectacle of wonder, this sophisticated property is characterized by its modern architecture. The epitome of style, the diamond shaped exterior blends well with the organic hanging gardens, boasting some 14, 310 plants.
All 219 rooms and suites feature floor to ceiling windows and the rooftop bar boasts the best city and ocean views in town. The rooms divided into Junior Suites, Executive Suites and a presidential suite are all luxuriously furnished and offering access to the rooftop infinity pool and Jacuzzi.
“Movenpick Hotel Colombo is an inspirational modern landmark that introduces exciting new hospitality concepts to the city and this signifies a new era of prosperity for an island nation reenergized and undergoing rapid development,” said Chief Operating Officer Movenpick Hotels and Resorts, Middle East and South Asia, Andreas Mattmuller.
The property offers the largest executive lounge, dedicated business traveler reception, including five meeting rooms and a boardroom.
The hotel offers an astronomical gastronomic experience! With seven creative bar and restaurant concepts from which to choose.

All day dining venue AYU, Vistas Rooftop Bar & Lounge, the exclusive Mansion bar and night lounge, the chic Lobby Lounge and the Pool Bar where drinks and light meals can be enjoyed.
Guests can also enjoy a workout with a view at the fully equipped gym located 100 meters high or relax at the Spa Ceylon where signature treatments use natural oils and herbs.
“We set out to build this hotel to appeal to market segments such as business minds, leisure travelers those coming in and out of Colombo on holiday, with the need to stay near the airport and also gambling enthusiasts from India and the Middle East. We want to be the lifeblood of the hotel experience delivery for business leisure travelers and local patrons. Our strategy was to find a hotel operator with an international reach and we found the ideal partner in Movenpick,” said Softlogic CEO/Director Dr. Stephan L. Anthonisz

It shows attentiveness with charm. All of the aforesaid align perfectly with soft-logic credo of best in the business.
“This signifies a new era in Colombo’s long history. It is a statement of positive optimism, post- civil war, with a contrast of modern architecture and natural hanging gardens. It also represents a vertical experience providing a touch of altitude and attitude to Colombo’s traditional hotel market. The project architect was our very own Murad Ismail. The guest rooms have the feeling of space with floor to ceiling glass, where one can view the culturally rich and colorful Colombo scape. The interiors are modern, cool, chic and sophisticated,” pointed out Anthonisz.
The Hotel provides a whole new level in design, vistas, comfort, service and technology delivered by Movenpick, Swiss fashion with a Sri Lankan soul. The project is the result of tireless effort of Prof. Chitra Weddikara and many others.

Also a special thank you to the many regulatory bodies that assisted us with negotiating the bureaucracy. We believe that the Movenpick hotel Colombo brand promise of natural enjoyment will be delivered in a way that is compelling and competitive,” added Anthonisz.
