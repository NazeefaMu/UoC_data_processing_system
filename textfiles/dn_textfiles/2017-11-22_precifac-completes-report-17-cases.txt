PRECIFAC COMPLETES REPORT ON 17 CASES

The Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC) has completed investigations into 17 cases.
PRECIFAC Chairman, High Court Judge Preethi Padman Surasena has requested the President for a date to submit the completed reports.
The commission’s term will expire on December 3 and thus they need to submit the report to the President prior to that.
The reports contain recommendations made by the Commission and the final overall report of the commission, PRECIFAC Secretary, M.W. Gunadasa told the Daily News.
At the time of handing over, it is expected that Commission Chairman and members High Court Judge Vikum Kaluarachchi, High Court Judge Gihan Kulathunga and retired Auditor General, P. A. Premathilake would be present on the occasion.
The commission has already submitted prior reports with recommendations to the President and he in turn has directed them to the Attorney General’s Office and the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) for further legal action to be taken.
