New hues on the ‘Block’

Bright eyes, bright lips and bright cheeks — That’s colour blocking for you! Slash out the most important ‘rule’ of make-up and just dive in to one of the biggest trends of the season!
Colour blocking is an understated trend. The most recent celebrity to sport it was Aishwarya Rai Bachchan at the Cannes Film Festival. Amping things up with her blue eyes and tangerine lips! The look made headlines, and set tongues wagging — despite how a volley of people loved and loathed it, the look didn’t go unnoticed. And, irrefutably, the look has caught every beauty enthusiast’s fancy. The reasons to try out colour blocking are aplenty: It accentuates every feature of your face. If you like standing out in a crowd, colour blocking your makeup is the way to go and it lets you experiment with a riot of bright colours!
While the look isn’t easy to sport, it’s well-worth a try. But, you ought to follow a few guidelines in order to not make a beauty blunder. It is important to adhere to a list of contrasts, as per your skin tone:
Fair skin tone: People with fairer to wheatish skin tone can always do a match of bright eyes (red, yellow, electric blue) and deep/dark lips (maroon, brown, purple). Bright eyes and bright lips might look great, but could get a tad bit loud!
Dusky skin tone: Wheatish complexion can carry off any match! But the sexiest would be a match of deep/dark eyes (maroon, bottle green, dark blue) and deep lips or bright lips (red, pink, purple)
Dark skin tone: With colour blocking, the darker the skin tone the more fun it becomes! Dark skin tone, anything goes! Bright eyes with bright lips, dark eyes with dark lips or a mix and match of both!
Remember the skin tone is hardly the thing to worry about when it comes to make-up, especially colour blocking. Keep in mind other things which can help you slay your look! For example, your eye colour, sharpness of your eyebrows and thickness of your lipstick.
