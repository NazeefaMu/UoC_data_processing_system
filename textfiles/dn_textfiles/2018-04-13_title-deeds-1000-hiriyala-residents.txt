Title deeds  for 1,000  Hiriyala residents

A programme had been implemented to offer about 1,000 residents of the Hiriyala electorate in the Kurunegala district, with title deeds for lands.
The programme is being carried out by Hiriyala United National Party Chief Organiser Jagath Manjula Yapa, in order to aid low-income families of the electorate.
Chief Government Whip Gayantha Karunathilake and Lands Reform Commission officials, recently visited the Hiriyala electorate and made arrangements for the cause. The title deeds would be awarded to relevant land owners at the end of this month, Yapa told the Daily News.
