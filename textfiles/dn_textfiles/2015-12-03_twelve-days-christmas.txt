Twelve Days to Christmas

The joy and cheer of Christmas comes early to Mount Lavinia Hotel with Twelve Days to Christmas: a Christmas Party for Kids on December 13 from 3pm to 6pm.
An array of exciting activities is in store to keep little one busy throughout the evening. The customary party attractions in the form of Bouncy Castles, Face Painting, Magic Balloons, Games accompanied by Party Music are in place. The special attraction this year would be the Magic Show by MLH's own secret magician who will keep the kids enthralled with his amazing and funny illusions. In addition, the 'Little Patisserie' will allow them to create some of their own Christmas goodies, and decorate the Gingerbread House with the help of our friendly Pastry Chefs.
The little tummies will be taken care of with an 'all-you-can-eat' buffet inclusive of favourite kiddies' snacks like Mini Santa Burgers, Fish Fingers, Sausages on Sticks, Mini Pizza Wheels and Mac & Cheese. For the sweet-toothed, Chocolate Crackles, White Chocolate Florentine Slices, Mini Cup Cakes, Snow Eggs, Santa's Cookies, Gingerbread Men and a delicious Chocolate Fountain with Yummy Goodies and an amazing Ice Cream Bar to choose from.
The highlight of the evening would certainly be a 'Moment with Santa', who will have a special gift for every child. Santa will also sit for photographs, sing and dance till the end of the party.
Parents are welcome to accompany the kids and be part of the fun and frolic this Christmas at Mount Lavinia Hotel.
