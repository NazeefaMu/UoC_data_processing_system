Arjun Aloysius arrives at PCoI

 
Former Perpetual Treasuries (PTL) Director Arjun Aloysius arrived at the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) into Treasury Bond issue for the sixth time, a short while ago.
The PCoI issued summons on Monday to record a statement on the recovered call recordings which were presented before the PCoI.
The recovered call recordings revealed Arjun Aloysius passing sensitive inside information on the February 27, 2015 Treasury bond auction to PTL CEO Kasun Palisena.
