Police can shoot if Penal Code is violated – Spokesman

Police personnel have been issued orders to shoot in instances where Clause 93 and 96 of the Penal Code is violated, Police Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said.
He said this does not suggest that Police can simply shoot a person. “But what it means is that Police can use force required even upto the point of killing a person in such instances. Shooting a person is also included in this clause. In one sentence it says during incidents of looting or such violations of the Penal Code,” the Police Spokesman said.
SP Gunasekara was speaking at a media briefing at the Police Headquarters yesterday.
Gunasekara noted that there are also instructions included in the Police orders which outline the instances where Police could open fire. These laws are also formulated based on Clauses 93 and 96 of the Penal Code under the conditions specified.
He further added that two armed Police personnel will be deployed per polling station for security during the upcoming Local Government elections, in addition to the mobile patrols. The Police Headquarters has issued a booklet to all Police stations bearing instructions and guidelines in terms of all Police duties. The booklet which will be distributed within the next few days is printed in all three languages and it provides all the regulations and advice required to be followed by Police personnel with regard to the upcoming elections.
