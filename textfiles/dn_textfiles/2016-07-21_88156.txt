D. V. Upul says: I will continue to function as minister

The top preferential vote taker of Hambantota district in the Southern Province, D. V. Upul yesterday said contrary to a constitutionally permissible four-member board of ministers, the Southern Provincial Council now has a five-member board of ministers with the appointment of H. W. Gunasena as Southern Provincial Minister of Fisheries, Livestock, Environment, Electricity and Rural Industries.
Asked who the fifth is, Upul said Gunasena is the 5th minister. President Maithripala Sirisena appointed H. W. Gunasena as Southern Provincial Minister of Fisheries, Livestock, Environment, Electricity and Rural Industries yesterday, which is the portfolio held by D. V. Upul.
Upul said, “I continue to function as a minister. The media had it all wrong when they said I have been removed.”
He said he went to the Council yesterday and carried out his functions and even took part in the Provincial Cabinet. “I have not even received a letter to the effect that I have been removed from office,” he said. Asked if he liked the idea of another minister being appointed to the post held by him, Upul said,” if that is what the President wanted, Gunasena is the last person I can think of as being the candidate for that portfolio under the principles of Yahaplanaya”
“I really think our UPFA Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera did promote his brother-in-law Gunasena because of a social issue,” he said. Speaking from a democratic perspective if I was to be be removed, they could have considered other UPFA members who secured much higher votes than Gunasena in the last Southern Provincial Council Election.
Gunasena came fifth whereas I topped the list with preferential votes.
Next to me in the list of vote takers were M. K. Kasun, Ajith Rajapaksa, and Kapila Dissanayaka. H. W. Gunasena ranked lower than these candidates at the Southern Provincial poll,” he pointed out.
