Dinesh, Ananda stamp their class at Mahagastota

Dinesh Jayawardena and Ananda Sampath Weerasinghe stamped their class at the 83rd Mahagastota Festival of Speed by becoming the fastest driver and rider respectively.
One of the oldest and most prestigious events in the Sri Lankan motor racing calendar, the Mahagastota festival of Speed was conducted by the Ceylon Motor Sports Club at the Pedro Estate, where some of Sri Lanka’s best drivers and riders engaged in a race against the clock.
Jayawardena, competing in the SL-GT cars upto 3500cc event, finished the uphill drive in just 33.657 seconds.

Darin Weerasinghe took 34.236 seconds to reach the finish line and that earned him the second place in the SL-GT category. Shafraz Junaid was the third fastest, clocking 38.570 seconds. Darin was unfortunate to have crashed out in his first attempt.
Returning to action after a lapse of two years, Dilan Seneviratne topped the time sheets in both events he took part. Seneviratne clocked fastest times in the Formula Ford 1600cc and Formula Modified up to 1665cc categories.
