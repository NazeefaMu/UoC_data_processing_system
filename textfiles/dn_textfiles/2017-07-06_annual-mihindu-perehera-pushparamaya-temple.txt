The annual Mihindu perehera of Pushparamaya Temple in Kirulapone was held recently for the 26th consecutive year. It is one of the oldest and grandest Buddhist festivals organised by the temple, featuring dancers, jugglers, musicians, fire-breathers and lavishly decorated elephants.
The ritual was performed by carrying the sacred relics through the streets of Kirulapone by the Nadungamuwe Tusker of Sri Dalada Maligawa. Nalin Nugawela was the Banayake Nilame.
The perehera came to a successful completion under the guidance of Chief Incumbent of the temple ven. Vishwakeerthi Dharamavisharada Panditha Elkaduwe Nagitha Thera and Ven. Divithure Samantha Thera. the organising committee too shouldered a huge responsibility by organising this pageant.
