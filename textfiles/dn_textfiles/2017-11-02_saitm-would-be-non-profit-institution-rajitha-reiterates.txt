SAITM would be a non-profit institution, Rajitha reiterates

Co-Cabinet Spokesman Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne yesterday said the SAITM would not be abolished or nationalized. However, it will function as a non-profit institution approved by the Higher Education Ministry.
He made this observation at the weekly Cabinet media briefing held yesterday at the Government Information Department.
Minister Senaratne said the SAITM will function as a non-profit institution which means that the surplus revenues of this institution will be used only for the improvement of the institution without distributing it to the organization's shareholders.
Responding to a journalist who inquired about Dr. Neville Fernando’s response to the government’s decision, the Minister said Dr. Neville Fernando has already agreed to this decision.
When a journalist asked whether any decision has been taken to transfer the SAITM to the SLIIT, Minister Senaratne said not only the SLIIT, but also some other educational institutions have shown willingness to take the SAITM under them.
Responding to a query by a journalist who claimed that the Government Medical Officers’ Association does not agree to the government’s decision on the SAITM completely, the Minister said if the GMOA does not agree with the government’s decision, they should suggest their own solution for the SAITM issue.
