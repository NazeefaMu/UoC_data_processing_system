Crucial Super Four match today to decide finalist :
Bangladesh to exploit on Pakistan’s low confidence factor

DUBAI, Tuesday: Bangladesh will try to exploit the low confidence the Pakistan team are currently going when they meet their Asian rivals in what could be termed a semi-final clash of the Asia Cup Super Four at Abu Dhabi tomorrow (Wednesday).
With India already having booked their berth for Friday’s final, the other finalist will be decided on the winners of the Bangladesh-Pakistan match.
Bangladesh’s new head coach Steve Rhodes of England was optimistic about his team’s chances against Pakistan.
“I think we have got a great chance. We respect Pakistan as a team and they played really well to win the Champions Trophy not too long ago. Their tournament has been interesting. They're possibly playing with lack of little bit of confidence and not quite the same confidence as they were in the Champions Trophy but they are still a very dangerous team and on their day they can really put things together and play some good cricket,” said Rhodes.
“We are respectful to them as a team but we are also looking forward to the challenge. It'll be a great contest. We wanted to be in this position when we set off from Bangladesh; try and beat Pakistan and get through to a wonderful final against India.”
Rhodes was confident that his batsmen will be able to take on the Pakistan fast bowling attack which is their main strength.
“Yes, they come with some challenges. They have a little more pace but the wicket at Abu Dhabi has tended to be on the slower side so it hasn't necessarily been in favour of fast bowlers. That can be a good thing the ball can come on to the bat well,” said Rhodes. “Sometimes when the wicket is slow, facing medium-pacers might become a little more difficult. So because of the slowness of the wicket the ball will come nicely onto the bat with their pace. That is what I’m hoping for,” he said.
Rhodes said that Bangladesh’s last ball three-run win over Afghanistan two days ago was a morale booster for the team. “We lost the T20 against them (in June in India) and we lost the next game (in league stage) against them, so it was a boost. We are in good shape. Pakistan is the favourite for this game but that puts us in a nice position because they know we are a dangerous side. To go into that game as an underdog might work in our favour because we can really make that work.”
Pakistan’s leading run-scorer in the current Asia Cup and their most experienced cricketer Shoaib Malik said the two losses to India was the best thing to happen and that they can work out on their weaknesses.
“The best thing is to sit down and talk about it and come out with different plan. If the plans are not working then we must sit down and devise some other plan. We have lost to India in two games, there are areas where we have to improve,” said Malik.
“We have discussed them, communicated and you will see improvement. We are going through some tough times. This is not the end of the world. There will be changes, not team wise, but in terms of changing plans for individuals.” Malik was of the view the Pakistan side lacked experience and that the experienced players were missing out on scoring the runs.
“Our batting line up needs stability, these are not pitches where you look for 300-350. If you stay at the pitch, don't lose wickets then later in the innings you get a chance to score runs. We must play according to the situation,” said Malik.
“There is a lack of experience. The experienced players assess the conditions. That thing is missing but the players are talented they have given performances so I am sure they will come back,” he said hopefully.
