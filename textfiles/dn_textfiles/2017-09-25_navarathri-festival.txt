Navarathri Festival

The word 'Navarathri' means nine auspicious nights for religious celebration of Durga Lakshmi and Saraswathi. On these nine days, devotees celebrate this festival in their homes, schools, workplaces and temples.
This festival occurs during end of September and beginning of October according to Hindu calendars. During these nine days, nine varieties of cereals are planted in earthen pots and most of the devotees observe fasting by breaking rest at night.
