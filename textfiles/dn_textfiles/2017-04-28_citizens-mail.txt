MAY DAY IS FOR WORKERS AND NOT FOR POLITICIANS
Arrangements are being made to celebrate MAY DAY on a very grand scale. These celebrations comprise festivities, colourful pageants and processions. Unfortunately, we have forgotten the true meaning of International Labour Day or the May Day. May Day is connected to the interests of workers. This we have forgotten.
The first May Day demonstration was in Chicago in 1886. 80, 000 workers went on strike. Police tried to disperse the participants of the rally. Violence erupted when a bomb was thrown by someone. Violence erupted. Eight workers were killed.
Demonstrations began all around the world to mark the Chicago incident. May first was accepted for an annual demonstration worldwide.
In Sri Lanka May Day has become politicized. It has become a political event. Politicians are using the MAY DAY to show their power and strength. The MAY DAY RALLY having the largest crowd is assumed to be the most popular political party.
May Day celebrations in Sri Lanka is not directly connected to the interests of the working class. May Day rallies are organised by political parties. These rallies are attended by party followers. Very few actual workers attend these rallies.
The workers in Sri Lanka do not know the meaning of MAY DAY celebrations. We have to think about the following when talking about MAY DAY:
May Day rallies should be arranged by workers and trade unions.
Doctors and nurses have trade unions. They also can arrange MAY DAY rallies.
Politicians are not workers. It is a joke for the politicians to organise MAY DAY rallies.
Alcohol is served in MAY DAY rallies to attract people.
Participants of MAY DAY rallies are given food and money by politicians.
Politicians are hiring buses to bring people to the rallies from out stations.
Mainly politicians are making speeches at MAY DAY rallies. Only very few workers are allowed to speak at MAY DAY rallies. Red is the accepted color for flags and decorations related to MAY DAY celebrations. But in Sri Lanka MAY DAY celebration colours are green, blue, etc.
Very little is done by media to educate the workers on the true meaning of MAY DAY.
When we read the MAY DAY messages of our leaders, they have very little things related to rights of workers. MAY DAY messages is full of national and political issues.
In Sri Lanka the salaries of workers are very low. They are provided very few benefits compared to executives. This has to be corrected. In many government offices, only the low grade officers have to sign the attendance register. This has to be corrected. Only the high grade officers are provided training in many places. This has to be corrected.
MEDICAL SCHEMES AND INSURANCE POLICIES are provided only in very few places.
Government can start a PENSION SCHEME covering all private sector employees. Labour Department should look into this.
POLITICIANS are paid a very high pension after five years of service. Some privileged employees are paid EPF, ETF and a very good pension. Some privileged employees and politicians are given tax free vehicle permits. Sometimes this is worth several millions of rupees. Public bus service is very poor. Workers pay for a seat and go as standing passengers. Government should look into this.
Some Senior Managers in Sri Lanka treat the workers like their domestic employees. They are very rude. They shout at employees in the presence of other employees. They insult the junior employees.
There is corruption among very senior executives. Workers suffer due to this.
In many private sector organisations, the owners do not allow workers to form trade unions. Workers’ rights are not given. Labour Department is well aware of this situation. They do not do anything to correct this situation.
If a worker tries to form a trade union, he is immediately sacked. There are firms of lawyers helping companies to prevent workers forming trade unions. This is not a secret. In private sector organisations, the inquiry and investigation procedure is one sided. Inquiries are done in a very unfair manner. Innocent workers are sacked very often. Labour Department should look into this.
Go to some of the factories and see. Workers are working under very unhygienic conditions. Safety equipment are not provided.
Rest rooms and proper toilet facilities are not provided. No wash rooms.
There are no welfare facilities. Some factories and working places are very dirty.
There are no rest rooms. There are no proper cupboards for workers to keep their clothes and valuables.
Some employers do not allow workers to use mobile phones. They are unable to contact their parents and husbands. Uniforms are not provided. There are no proper canteens.
Company owners are making millions and millions of profits. They go all over the world for vacations. But the workers are very poorly paid.
Salaries of workers are not paid in time. Salary details are not provided.
Many workers are not provided EPF, ETF and Gratuity. LABOR DEPARTMENT does not check.
There are so many unfair things happening related to rights of workers. We have mentioned here a few of them. Politicians should look into these problems of workers. Just organizing POLITICAL RALLIES on the MAY DAY is of no use.
