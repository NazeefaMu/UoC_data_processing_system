Bowlers who sledge are cowards: Andy Roberts

 
As the elevator of a five-star hotel rushed from zero to the 23rd floor, it was sort of ironical to hear the hotel's guests talking about the speed of the lift, without realizing they had Sir Andy Roberts for company.
The legendary West Indian fast bowler too enjoyed the moment away from public attention that he has been used to getting since 41 years of him as a cricketer.
Roberts, 64, was in Pune to visit cricket museum Blades of Glory, and the former right-arm pacer, who was part of the famous West Indian quartet along with Michael Holding, Joel Garner and Colin Croft, spoke to TOI about contemporary cricket.
Like his bowling, his replies to all the questions were as sharp as they could.
Excerpts:
Q: You were part of world cricket's most feared bowling attack. Have you seen a pace attack like that in any of the present teams?
AR: No I haven't seen it and I am not going to see it. I am not saying it won't happen, but I don't think I will live to see it because that 'quartet' was different. Today you can't put four different bowlers like that together. We were all different in everything you could think of. We were different in height, we were different in mannerism, we were different in temperament and we were different in skills. I think that's what made the combination so good.
Q: You must be good friends off the field to share a bond like that while playing?
AR: Not all four were good friends. I am still friends with Michael (Holding), but with the others (Garner and Croft) I never socialised while we were playing. We were friends, but to say we were close won't be right. But on the field everyone was for everyone. We had a common thing: we all hated losing.
Q: A lot of aggression was expressed through the eyes of the bowlers in your era. How do you see young fast bowlers indulging in sledging to heat the contest up?
AR: Sledging has always been there. I don't think they sledge half of as much now as they did in the past. One more thing about sledging is that the bowlers who sledge are cowards. Why do you have to get in someone's face? You have the ball in hand, let the ball do the talking.
Q: When West Indies, England and Australia boasted of fast bowlers, India had their quartet of spinners. Down the line, do you think India has the same level of quality spinners?
AR: No. I don't think India has stuck to their strength that was spin bowling. Now they are dependent more on doctored pitches to suit the spinners. So the Indian spinners don't get much juice outside India because they don't get the assistance as they get at home.
Q: Are you referring it to the Nagpur Test?
AR: It isn't about just Nagpur Test, it is about all the Tests. Home advantage should be avoided.
Q: How do you see India's progress as a Test team?
AR: I see India have decided to play a couple of fast bowlers and that makes the difference in Test cricket. I think they need to develop a programme where they have bowlers who can consistently bowl at 90-95mph. Until they do that, they will not be able to compete outside India. And if you want to be world champions, you need to do well outside your territory.
Q: So what should they do to bowl consistently?
AR: Indian bowlers need to bowl as much as they can because people say they shouldn't over bowl in practice. But it is difficult for me to play a Test match after bowling four overs in the practice and then expect me to bowl 20 overs in a day. That is why I believe so many injuries occur, because bowlers get tired in the match.
Q: West Indies cricket is nowhere close to where you had left.
AR: There is so much wrong with West Indies cricket that it will take me two days to complete the answer, so I don't even want to start. Priorities are changing and most of it started right here in India. West Indies are the only team that suffered because the players are not prepared to go back for international commitments. I don't agree with their thinking. Some of them may tell you that they don't owe anything to West Indies cricket, but they some gratitude towards the West Indies cricket board and public, because they didn't come up by themselves. They came up through a system provided by their territories and the cricket board. If I had anything to do with the board, none of them would be playing it (for the clubs) because I wouldn't be signing any NOCs. You have to commit yourself to represent your territory if required. If your best players consistently take part in domestic cricket, your team cannot come up.
Q: You had openly expressed your displeasure about a LBW decision that went against you while bowling to England's Peter Willey. In today's context, do you think the review system is a good technology?
AR: There are so many things that are flawed. But if there is some technology that assists the umpires, why not use it. My only problem with the technology is the ball tracking system. According to the technology, everything goes above the stumps. Even though you hit the ball below the knee, it goes over the stumps and that is my biggest problem (with DRS). The cameras I believe are up high and you are trying to judge the height of the ball from up high. When you see it with the naked eyes, you know it is not going high. But having said that, I believe DRS should be continued. It takes a lot of pressure off the umpires, because even today the umpires make a signal, they don't have guts to say whether you are out or not out. - TNN
