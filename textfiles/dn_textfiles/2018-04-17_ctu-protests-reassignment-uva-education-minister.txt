CTU protests reassignment of  Uva Education Minister

The Ceylon Teachers’ Union (CTU) yesterday protested against the reappointment of Uva Province Chief Minister Chamara Sampath Dassanayake as the Province’s Education Minister.
Dassanayake was asked to step down from his post as the province’s Education Minister after having humiliated and threatened Badulla Tamil Girls’ School Principal R. Bawani on January 3. Following protests against his actions, President Maithripala Sirisena had removed him from his position until investigations were to be concluded.
The Chief Minister, according to the Union, was reinstated last week, prior to former Uva Province Governor M. P. Jayasinghe being transferred to the North Central Province.
“We see that this has been a drama; an election trick. The Magistrate’s case against him has not concluded and the Human Rights Commission is still conducting investigations, but he has been reinstated,” CTU General Secretary Joseph Stalin said.
He added that the Union, together with other organisations, would take action against the reinstatement after schools reopen. They have already sent a letter to the President, protesting Dassanayake’s reappointment.
