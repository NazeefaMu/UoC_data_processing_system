Wild elephants terrorising villages in Ambanpola

Invading wild elephants have been terrorising residents in several villages in the Ambanpola DS division in recent times. Among the threatened villages are Waragammana, Kaluperumawa, Kasicote, Amunugama and Udagama.
A herd of wild elephants which invaded Waragammana a few days ago have uprooted and damaged a large number of Banana, Coconut and Cadju trees. A herd which rampaged Amunugama village had damaged the walls of a house and feasted on a bag of rice found inside the house.
Residents said that even though the wild life department had erected an electrified fence around Ambanpola division to ward off elephants, the fence had been broken at several points. Residents said they protected their meager food and other assets with great trouble during the prolonged drought. When the wilted banana and coconut trees got re-energised with the onset of rains, it was catastrophic to see them devastated by rampaging elephants. They said the dearth of Hakka Patas and other explosives also was a factor which stifled their efforts to drive away marauding elephants.
