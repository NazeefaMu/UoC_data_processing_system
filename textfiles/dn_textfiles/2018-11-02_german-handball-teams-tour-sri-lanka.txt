German handball teams to tour Sri Lanka

More than 10 handball teams from Germany will tour Sri Lanka early next year on the invitation of the Asian German Sports Exchange Programme.
The tours have been arranged with the intention of promoting handball in Sri Lanka on a request by Sri Lanka National Handball coach Superintendent of Prisons D. Senaratne.
Handball is an immensely popular sport in Germany and by playing against German teams the Lankan handball teams will gain the much needed exposure against foreign teams.
The Sri Lanka Handball Federation was established in 2008 and the game is gradually gaining popularity in the country with the three forces Army, Navy and Air Force taking part regularly in handball matches.
The Asian German Sports Exchange Programme was set up in 1989 to promote sports tours between the two countries and to mark its 30th anniversary these tours have been arranged for early 2019.
Two handball players from Germany Elina Gansweith and Kevin Cordshagen are the co-cordinators of the tours by German handball teams to Sri Lanka and are taking great pains to make the tours a success.
