'Addicts begin smoking even before 19 years'

Almost 90 percent of those in the tobacco smoking habit today have got used to smoking during their teens even before 19 years, said Dr. G. Ganeshan said.
He made these comments at a press conference at the Government Information Department on Wednesday.
The press conference was held to launch the results of a survey done based on 18 Tamil films screened recently. The Liquor and Drugs Information Centre had conducted the survey on the manner in which liquor, cigarettes and drug use had been promoted in Indian Tamil films screened from June to September this year.
Dr. Ganeshan said the survey revealed that 17 films subjected to this survey had devoted two hours and 20 minutes to promote the use of liquor and drugs.
This amounts to a total duration of a single film. This could be considered as similar to viewing an entire film promoting smoking and liqour, he said.
Dr. Ganeshan said the film Marie devoted 22 minutes for smoking promotion while the film Vasuvumasarawanaum used 25 minutes for the same.
"These films were very popular among the youth and they are likely to be included to imitate the scenes portrayed in them," he said.
