Two-year-old girl dies falling from moving car

A two-year-old girl died after falling out of a moving car in the Wattegama area yesterday.
The child in the rear seat had been thrown out onto the road when the backdoor had suddenly sprung open. The child’s parents had been inside the vehicle at the time of the accident.
The Police believe the door may have opened due to a technical fault. The driver was arrested.
Investigations are continuing.
