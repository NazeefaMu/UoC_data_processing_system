Sergeant's nose slashed by pillion rider

A pillion rider of a motorcycle had slashed the nose of a police sergeant who was on duty at Yakkaduwa Junction in Elpitiya yesterday morning.
Police sources said the sergeant who was severely injured was admitted to the Elpitiya Base Hospital. He was later transferred to the Karapitiya Hospital.
The pillion rider had slashed the sergeant's nose with a sharp sword when the police signaled the motorcyclists to stop, sources said. The police have been on alert following a tip off that some chain snatchers were moving about in the area and had tried to stop the motorcycle since it looked suspicious.
