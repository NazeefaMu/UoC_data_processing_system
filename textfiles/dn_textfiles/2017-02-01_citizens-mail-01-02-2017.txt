Fearful behaviours of elephants
In my letter to your columns on July 27, 2016, I emphasized the dangerous behaviours of the elephants, especially when they are engaged in processions, very particularly in ‘peraheras’, the need of carrying tranquilizers as precautionary steps in case those massive animals run amok.
But it seems nobody to have bothered about it. Even the police had not advised those who are engaged in using elephants for events.
The Daily News recently carried a news item in which it states that an elephant participating in a ‘Perahera’ at Gandara had run amok causing extensive damages for private and public properties, damaging three-wheelers, electrical post, etc. However it had been brought under control by the Wild Life Department authorities after five hours. What would have been the situation if it had attacked the spectators that include small children during the whole of five hours? Who will take the responsibility if some casualties have occurred?
I have often come across opinions and suggestions of the public published in newspapers. They seemed to give some food for thoughts for those both in the parliament and Cabinet as well. But those politicians do not wish to hearken or acknowledge such opinions and suggestions and thus involve in their proposed activities which are often detrimental to the people or the country.
My question is, are the relevant authorities waiting till human lives are trampled to death?
