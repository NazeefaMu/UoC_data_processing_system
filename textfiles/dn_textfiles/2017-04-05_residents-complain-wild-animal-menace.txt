Wild animal threats is also reported from Alayadivembu and Pottuvil DS divisions.
With the end of the torrential rains which lasted during the past two months, wild elephants have started invading nearby villages in the Thirukkovil DS division in search of food, while damaging paddy lands in the Ampara district.
The menace of marauding elephants in the village of Thangavelayutha puram re-settlement village in the Thirukkovil Divisional Secretariat Division has instilled fear among villagers.
