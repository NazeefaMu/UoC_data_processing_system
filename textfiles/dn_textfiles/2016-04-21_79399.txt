Mahinda will not attend May Day rally: Amaraweera

 
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was asked for an appointment to invite him to the UPFA May Day rally scheduled to be held at the Samanala Grounds, Galle, UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera said.
He was addressing the SLFP weekly media briefing at the SLFP Headquarters yesterday.
The General Secretary added that they are waiting for the appointment from the Rajapkasa's, at which point the invitation for the May Day rally will be handed over.
Amaraweera said that he still thinks that Parliamentarian Mahinda Rajapaksa will not participate in the May Day rally organised by the Joint Opposition. When asked whether any tough action will be taken against SLFP party members who will participate in the Joint Opposition rally rather than boycott it, he said such a decision would be taken by the party.
