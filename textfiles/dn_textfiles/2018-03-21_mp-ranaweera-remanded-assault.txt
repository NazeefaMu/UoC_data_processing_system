MP Ranaweera remanded for assault

Gampaha district UPFA MP of the Joint Opposition Prasanna Ranaweera was ordered to be remanded until March 22 by the Mahara Magistrate yesterday.
He was produced in the Mahara Magistrate’s Court yesterday in connection with an assault incident.
Charges were filed against Ranaweera for having assaulted a UNP candidate who contested for the Kelaniya Pradeshiya Sabha at the recent LG elections.
Although police had gone to Ranaweera’s house on several occasions to arrest him over this incident, he had evaded arrest.
The incident is said to have taken place on February 28 during a birthday party held at a house in Kiribathgoda, near the Vihara Maha Devi Balika Vidyalaya, where Prasanna Ranaweera and another person had assaulted Jagath Prasanna Gamage.
Police had notified Court that the person who sustained injuries in the assault is currently receiving treatment at the Kiribathgoda hospital.
