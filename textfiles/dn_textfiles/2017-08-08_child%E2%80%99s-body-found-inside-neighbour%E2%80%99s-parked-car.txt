Child’s body found inside neighbour’s parked car

A five-year-old child who was found unconscious inside a car parked close to his home in Akkaraipattu had been pronounced dead after been admitted to the hospital yesterday.
A search for the boy had been launched the previous evening after parents complained that the boy had not returned home after going to a nearby shop.
The car the boy was found belongs to a neighbour, the Police said. He had found the boy inside the car when he opened its doors the next morning.
The Police suspect the boy may have got into the car out of curiosity and locked himself in accidentally and had died due to breathing difficulties.
The post-mortem examination was to be held later in the day.
