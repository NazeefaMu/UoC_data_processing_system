CCTV to become mandatory in all slaughterhouses in England

 
The UK government will make CCTV mandatory in all slaughterhouses in England under new plans announced today.
The proposals, contained in the Conservative manifesto, will require cameras to in all areas where live animals are present. They will provide vets with unrestricted access to footage.
“We have some of the highest animal welfare standards in the world and the actions I am setting out today will reinforce our status as a global leader,” said Environment Secretary Michael Gove as he announced the measure.
“As we prepare to leave the EU, these measures provide a further demonstration to consumers around the world that our food is produced to the very highest standards,” he added.
The government’s CCTV announcement was welcomed by animal health and food quality groups who said it would help with welfare and safety.
Emma Slawinski Compassion in World Farming’s Director of Campaigns said: “We are absolutely thrilled that the government has recognised the need for CCTV within slaughterhouses.
“Millions of animals each year are at risk of suffering behind the closed doors of slaughterhouses. Mandatory CCTV in slaughterhouses will provide the crucial transparency to ensure that legal protections are not being flouted,” she added.
Dr Marc Cooper, of the RSPCA, said he was “pleased” by the move which would lead to a “reduction in malpractice and an improvement in animal welfare”.
 British Veterinary Association president Gudrun Ravetz said: “It will provide an essential tool in fostering a culture of compassion that could help safeguard animal welfare and we are particularly pleased to see a commitment to Official Veterinarians having unrestricted access to footage,” said “Vets’ independence and unique qualifications help ensure that the UK will continue to have the highest standards of animal health, welfare and food safety,” she added.
Under the new plans for CCTV, footage would be accessible to the Food Standards Agency’s Official Veterinarians (OVs), who monitor and enforce animal welfare standards in the slaughterhouse.
Heather Hancock, Chairman of the Food Standards Agency, said she “warmly welcomed” the CCTV announcement.
“We see CCTV as an invaluable management tool for business owners to help with compliance with official controls and to improve animal welfare standards across the industry,” she said.
CCTV cameras are not mandatory in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland and there are no plans to introduce them there at the moment.
