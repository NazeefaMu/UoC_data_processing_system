Vasudeva strikes different chord

Parliamentarian Vasudeva Nanayakkara striking a different chord said he does not agree to fielding a brother of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa at the forthcoming Presidential poll.
However, he said he has no objection if a qualified candidate becomes the Presidential candidate.
“It does not matter even that person is a Rajapaksa sibling,”he said. Speaking to media regarding Rajapaksa’s statement in India that he could have an opportunity to get his brother for presidential candidacy at the forthcoming presidential election, Nanayakkara further said the statement made by Rajapaksa in India has no problem. “We can take a final decision after discussions with everyone,” he said.
