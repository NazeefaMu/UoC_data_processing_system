NCM will be a flop - Rajitha

The No-Confidence Motion (NCM) tabled against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will be a flop since it can be easily defeated in Parliament, Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
He was speaking to the media after participating in the World Tuberculosis Day walk which began from Independence Square to the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute premises on March 24.
Dr. Senaratne said they would join hands with all forces to defeat the No-Confidence Motion.
This government would continue till 2020. As the day coincided with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe’s birthday, he wished to greet the Prime Minister and wish him long life and ability to serve the people as the Prime Minister for a long time.
Dr. Senaratne said world attention had now been drawn towards eradicating Tuberculosis. The WHO had launched several programmes to achieve this objective as over 10 million Tuberculosis patients have been reported world wide.
The Health Ministry too had launched several programmes to educate the people towards eradicating this disease. Health Ministry Secretary Janaka Sugathadasa and other official participated.
