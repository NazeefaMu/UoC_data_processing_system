Rogaining, a sport tailor made for Sri Lanka

Rogaining is a lesser known sport in Sri Lanka, but will soon be popularized due to the island's very appropriate landscape for the sport.
Rogaining is the sport of long distance cross-country navigation. The championship rogaine is of 24 hours duration but there are several shorter versions of 3, 6, 8, 12, and 15 hours. There have also been longer events (dubbed 'Endurogaines') lasting 48 and 50 hours. In their native Australia, Rogaines are usually held every month during weekends near full moons, with annual state championships and an annual national championship. They require dozens of volunteers to run, including course setters and caterers and are often attended by hundreds of participants. A competitive 24-hour rogaine requires a map area of around 250 km 2 (~ 100 mi 2 ), for relatively flat terrain; terrain with significant climbs may require far less or far more area, depending on the placement of checkpoints. Teamwork, endurance, competition and an appreciation of the natural environment are features of the sport.
Rogaining involves both route planning and navigation between checkpoints using a variety of map types.
Rogaines are generally day and night events in which teams of two to five members travel entirely on foot, navigating by map and compass. Teams select their own order of visiting checkpoints in terrain that varies from open countryside to hilly forest.Teams travel at their own pace and anyone from children to grandparents can experience the personal satisfaction that comes from cross-country navigation at their own level of competition and comfort.
A central base camp known as a 'hash house' provides hot meals and teams may return at any time to eat, rest, sleep or enjoy the fellowship. Teams travel at their own pace, and anyone from children to grandparents can experience the personal satisfaction that comes from cross-country navigation at individual levels of competition and comfort.
Rogaining can trace its roots back to 1947 when the first of many events with some of the features of rogaines was organized by the Melbourne University Mountaineering Club. The events from the 1940s eventually led to the birth of the sport of rogaining in April, 1976, in Melbourne, Australia. The sport was named, rules were adopted and the world’s first rogaining association was formed (the Victorian Rogaining Association). Growth of the association and the sport occurred rapidly over the next decade.
Teams of two to five members visit as many checkpoints as possible in the time allowed. Shorter duration rogaines often allow solo competitors. Checkpoints are scored differently depending on level of difficulty in reaching them; therefore teams choose a strategy (for example, to visit many low score checkpoints). Teams travel entirely on foot, navigating by map and compass between checkpoints in terrain that varies from open farmland to hilly forest.
