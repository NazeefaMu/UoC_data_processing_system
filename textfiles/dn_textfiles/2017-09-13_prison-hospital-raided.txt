Prison hospital raided

In a surprise move, the Prison Intelligence Unit raided the prison hospital yesterday.
Prison Intelligence officers conducted the raid under a directive by Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Minister D.M. Swaminathan.
The raid lasted about an hour. The prison intelligence officers seized two mobile phones and two SIM cards in the hospital. Minister Swaminathan said he ordered a raid on the prison hospital after considering complaints on the hospital’s irregularities.
“The roundup was helpful for us to get an idea about the situation in the hospital,” the minister said.
He said the owners of the phones and SIM cards will be found out soon.
“We will take action against them and the officers who supported them to smuggle them into the prison hospital,” he said.
