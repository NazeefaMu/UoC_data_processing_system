Every month ‘Art in The Village’ will be screening a unique collection of art produced by local artistes from all corners of the nation.
The very first ‘Art in The Village’ will begin this June featuring ‘Kolamba Talkies’ screening ‘How to become a filmmaker with 10 dollars’, a film by first time filmmakers Dennis Perera and Chandana Prasanna and the film was nominated in the Best Director category at Barcelona Planet Film Festival 2016.
Kolamba Talkies (KT) came to light in 2014 as a concept that brings Sri Lankan Indie filmmakers together through a chain of screenings. Given that it’s common to have the works of many new generation filmmakers go unnoticed on the web without making it to a screen or without any constructive dialogue being formed around it mainly because the only spaces that accommodate such works are a limited number of film festivals and competitions held annually and the amount of productions that come about on a daily basis are far too many in number to be accommodated at such events. KT tries to fill this void with a monthly casual gathering that provides a space to all those who want to share their work and thoughts on productions and even to seek assistance for their ongoing work. KT is committed to keep away from formal structures of the industry and holds its screenings at homes, garages, open spaces or similar informal gathering spaces where there are no bureaucratic or thematic limitations welcoming all film and art enthusiasts!
First time filmmakers Dennis Perera and Chandana Prasanna presents How to become a filmmaker with 10 dollars, a film recognized internationally at the Euro-Fest - European International Film Festival 2016, Barcelona Planet Film Festival, and the Los Angeles CineFest where the film was selected as a Semi-Finalist. A story about two friends, with just 10 Dollars in their hand, set to interview famous local filmmakers in a bid to find a way to realize their filmmaking dream. With a handy-cam borrowed from a colleague and a guerilla-style shooting setup, they try to talk with as many filmmakers as possible, in the hope of cracking the ‘secret’ of becoming a filmmaker. Featuring award-winning filmmakers Vimukthi Jayasundara, Sanjeewa Pushpakumara, Prasanna Vithanage, this documentary follows an unconventional and heady journey, which reveals interesting aspects of Sri Lanka’s dying film industry and the story of few people who are still not ready to leave the sinking ship.
Dennis Perera who has studied the arts of theater, film direction, television programming and acting both formally and informally in and out of institutions, is the director of ‘Thathagatha’ (2007) and ‘Gotaimbara Kolama’ play performed in 2016 among a few other short dramas. He is the writer and director of ‘Three wheel diaries’ a film which is to be screened in the future among other short films directed by him. ‘How to become a filmmaker with $10’ is his first collaborated documentary film with his friend Chandana.
