Prophet Mohamed led path of peace: Palestine Ambassador

Prophet Mohamed practised a religious path of peace and encouraged his adherents to do the same, Sri Lankan Ambassador to Palestine M. Fawzan Anwer states in a message to mark the birthday of Prophet Mohamed.
“Prophet Mohamed epitomised unity and brotherhood in his life, and he taught the importance of compassion, tolerance and equality. The Holy Prophet throughout his life practised what he preached and he espoused an ordinary and simple life. In his teachings, he never failed to emphasise the values of truth and justice in a society and the importance of building a disciplined community of people. Prophet Mohamed’s profound teachings are vital in building and fostering reconciliation and unity among different communities,” the statement says.
“A Muslim respects and accepts the opinions of different juristic schools. He should never fight or quarrel with anyone, even those who are different from him in stances and conduct. He lives in peace, leaves others to enjoy peace, and trains himself to be peaceful and forgiving,” the Ambassador in his statement says.
“The celebration of the Holy Prophet’s birthday is therefore an occasion to recall the spirit of peace and harmony that the Prophet preached for 23 years. Today, it inspires Muslims and others towards living the kind of lives that honour Islam’s principles of communion and love towards fellow mankind. Let me take this occasion to wish all Muslims a peace filled Milad-un-Nabi,” he states.
