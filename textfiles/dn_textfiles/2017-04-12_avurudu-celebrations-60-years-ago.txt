Avurudu celebrations 60 years ago

When the sun moves from the Meena Rashiya (House of Pisces) to the Mesha Rashiya (House of Aries) in the celestial sphere, the Aluth Avurudda dawns for both, Sinhala and Tamils in Sri Lanka. It is a time for rejoicing, family reunions and engaging in traditions and rituals carried out through generations.
The Aluth Avurudda demonstrates our national ethos with its characteristic emphasis of the renewal and reaffirmation of goodwill within families and among all other citizens of the country.
In the good old days, no one went to a supermarket to buy Asmi, kevum, kokis, and other sweets specially made for the season. Then, Avurudu was essentially a family affair. Everyone in the family, young and old alike, gave a helping hand for the Avurudu celebrations.
Have things changed now? Avurudu sweets are readily available in supermarkets, and some take the easy way out without dirtying their hands with oil and flour. Practicing the traditional rituals too, has taken a beating over the years.
We desperately need to preserve our Avurudu traditions as these are based on the principles of the value of family, harmonious co-existence, tolerance, and peace.
With these articles and pictures published in the ‘Daily News’ in the 1950’s, we go back down the memory lane to look at how Avurudu was celebrated in the good old days.
