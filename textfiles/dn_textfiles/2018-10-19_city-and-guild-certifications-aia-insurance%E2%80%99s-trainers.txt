City and Guild certifications  for AIA Insurance’s trainers

AIA Insurance awarded certificates to its trainers who completed the ‘Train the Trainer’ program, which leads to City & Guilds (UK), Diploma and Advanced Diploma levels on international delivery standards. City & Guilds is the global leader in skill development and the oldest vocational qualification provider across the globe.
The program was facilitated by DAASH Global – DAASH Consultancy & Training (Pvt) Ltd. This program, which was conducted for five months, was led by Harshana Dassanayake who has over two decades of local and international training experience.
The focus was on empowering AIA’s trainers to deliver knowledge in an effective manner while ensuring a positive and lasting impact on the people they train. This will inevitably lead to a higher calibre of employees and agency force at AIA, in turn enabling more efficiency and effectiveness within the organization.
As a leading global insurer, AIA is committed to investing in human resources and setting high standards to deliver the best to their customers.
