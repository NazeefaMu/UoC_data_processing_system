Wigneswaran calls for the resignation of two Provincial Ministers

 
Northern Provincial Council (NPC) Chief Minister C V Wigneswaran called for the resignation of two Provincial Ministers at the Council meeting over corruption and fraud allegations today.
He asked NPC Education Minister T Kurukularaja and Agriculture Minister P Ingaranesan to hand over resignation letters by noon tomorrow.
The Chief Minister made this request when the NPC took up a debate on the report submitted by three-member committee, which investigated corruption allegations made against NPC ministers.
The Committee appointed by the Chief Minister last year comprised of two retired judges and one retired GA. Its report submitted last week has found evidence on the charges made against the above-mentioned two Provincial Ministers.  
The Chief Minister also requested Provincial Health Minister Dr. P Sathyalingm and Civil Transport and Fisheries Minister B Denishwaran to go on leave until the corruption and fraud charges against them are properly investigated.  
NPC Ministers Kurukularaja and Ingaranesan pleaded not guilty when they were given time to show cause with regard to the allegations. The Opposition Members of the Council staged a walk out at the NPC meeting stating they were not given opportunity to express their views on the report. Some members of the ruling party too walked out in protest of taking up a debate on the report.
The NPC is to meet again on June 22 to decide on the future steps.
