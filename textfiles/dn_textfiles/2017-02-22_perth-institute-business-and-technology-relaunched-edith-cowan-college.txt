Perth Institute of Business and Technology  relaunched as Edith Cowan College

Heralding the next phase of providing university pathway programmes to Sri Lankan students, a new joint venture between Navitas and Edith Cowan University paved the way to the relaunch of the Perth Institute of Business and Technology (PIBT) as Edith Cowan College (ECC).
Accordingly, ECC will continue to deliver all of its existing programmes in Business, IT, Engineering, Communications and Creative Industries, Health Studies as well as and Hotel Management with the potential for expansion of programmes in future years.
Professor Steve Chapman, Vice-Chancellor, Edith Cowan University said, “The Sri Lankan market is optimistic and it is growing very fast. Sri Lanka is very important to us and the relationship with Sri Lanka is getting stronger day by day. The launch of ECC will re-establish ECU's international growth strategy, ensure an excellent student experience for students joining the university from around the world, and set in place a modern, internationally competitive business model for pathway programme delivery.
ECC provides English language, pre-university, international study tours and university pathway programmes to international and domestic students on the Joondalup and Mount Lawley Campuses at Edith Cowan University Australia.
Boasting of a substantive research culture and innovative academic prowess, Edith Cowan University (ECU) provides academic opportunities in a variety of disciplines.
Over 27,000 undergraduate and postgraduate students pursue their higher education at ECU with an annual intake of over 4000 international students.
Established in 1991, ECU provides a distinctive and inspiring campus environment where students have the opportunity of obtaining guidance from a teaching staff with extensive academic and industry experience and networks in their respective disciplines.
Since the first intake in 1995, more than 8,000 students have graduated from PIBT (now ECC) and transferred to the degree programme at ECU.
“This joint venture signals the next exciting chapter in the 22-year relationship we have built with Edith Cowan University, our very first university partner,” Rod Jones, Navitas Group CEO said.
Navitas is a leader in developing and providing educational services and learning solutions to a student base of over 80,000 around the globe. Navitas specializes in University pathway programmes.
Armed with key insight into opportunities in the global higher education arena and a visionary approach to leveraging these, ECC is set to lead students on a journey of academic and career success.
