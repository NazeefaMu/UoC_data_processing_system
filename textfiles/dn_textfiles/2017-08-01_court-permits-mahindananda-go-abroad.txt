Court permits Mahindananda to go abroad

The Colombo High Court yesterday ordered to temporarily release former Sports Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage’s passport to enable him to obtain the United States’ visa.
MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage sought Court’s permission to travel to the United States between August 8 and 23.
High Court Judge Sampath Wijeratne made this order following a request by defence counsel.
On a previous occasion, the Colombo High Court had served indictments on former Sports Minister and Kandy District MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage in connection with an indictment filed against him by the Attorney General for alleged criminal breach of trust of Rs.3.9 million belonging to a trade union, the Sri Lanka Nidahas Kamkaru Congress.
The Attorney General alleged that former Minister Aluthgamage had committed a criminal breach of trust with regard to Rs.1,000,000, misappropriated Rs.1,900,000 and misappropriated another Rs.1,000,000 belonging to the Sri Lanka Nidahas Kamkaru Congress from October, 2012 to April 2013.
The Attorney General charged that the accused had committed punishable offences under section 388 and 389 of the Penal Code.
The Attorney General has listed 13 persons as the witnesses and named eight documents as production items of the case.
