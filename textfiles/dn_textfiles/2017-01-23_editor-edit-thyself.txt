Editor, edit thyself

As an editor-in-chief at two American publishing houses, Simon and Schus­ter and Alfred A. Knopf, from the mid-1960s through the late 80s, and as the Editor of the New Yorker from 1982–97, Robert Gottlieb has coddled and hectored more important American writers (and some British) than anyone since Maxwell Perkins dealt with the distinctions and deficiencies in the prose and egos of F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, James Jones, Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings and Thomas Wolfe. A partial list of Gottlieb’s writers would include Sybille Bedford, Anthony Burgess, John Cheever, Michael Crichton, Don DeLillo, Margaret Drabble, Joseph Heller, John le Carré, Doris Lessing, Toni Morrison, V. S. Naipaul, Edna O’Brien and Salman Rushdie. His non-fiction author list is equally impressive. He has worked with Bob Dylan, John Lennon and Paul Simon. Under his care, writers have won the Man Booker, National Book Awards, Pulitzer and Nobel Prizes. Now eighty-five and back at Knopf, Gottlieb is still going strong.
Given his involvement with so much talent, it is not surprising that Gottlieb was regularly encouraged by his friends to write about his professional life. He resisted. Why? In a Paris Review interview (1994), he explained: “I dislike writing: it’s very, very hard. I’m a talking animal, not a typing one”. Eventually, he caved in, but he could not entirely overcome his aversion, and his memoir carries the hallmarks of hasty composition or cursory editing, or both. As Le Carré put it, “Bob is voluble, speaks wonderfully and writes boringly . . . . He is all creative impulse and no creativity”. Avid Reader: A life is full of stale phrases, sketchy anecdotes and perfunctory accolades for all the wonderful guys and gals he’s worked with over the years. Many paragraphs begin with “And then came . . .” or other lazy transitions. For long stretches, his memoir is a dog-trot along the road of lit biz: blurbs, reviews, sales figures (Calories Don’t Count sold two million copies), jacket designs, print runs, and display ads (“our ads, everyone acknowledged, were the best in the business”). As I read, I kept muttering, “Editor, edit thyself!”
In compensation, Avid Reader is studded with accounts of how he solved stylistic and personal problems with his horde of idiosyncratic scribblers. Gottlieb was open to every solution, and had a different one for every writer. Some authors moved in with him and his wife, the actress Maria Tucci (Burgess for one). With others, he ate tuna fish sandwiches while sitting on the floor of his office (Le Carré tired of these meals and had a clause added to his contract calling for Gottlieb to take him to a fancy restaurant). Unlike most editors, he reads first drafts in days, sometimes overnight, a habit that has endeared him to his writers, most of whom waited “in a state of suspended emotional and psychic animation” for his response – a quick, honest estimate, and later, if necessary, a line-edit of the manuscript. “I have fixed more bad sentences”, he says, “than most people have read in their lives.” His mantra is “Do it now. Get it done. Check, check, and check again”. Widely read in virtually every prose genre, Gottlieb has an eye for structure. He agreed to take on Chaim Potok’s novel The Chosen (1967) only if the author went along with his judgement that the novel reached its natural end halfway through the manuscript. Potok acquiesced and also accepted the title, which had been suggested to Gottlieb by a friend he bumped into going to the men’s room. The Chosen was both a critical success and a number one bestseller.
Not all editorial fixes were this easy. Lauren Bacall had “an enviable fluency as a writer” but was insecure about her abilities as an actor, and had no idea what kind of routine was needed to write a full-length memoir. Gottlieb arranged for her to have an office at Knopf, and she came in daily, “working in longhand on long yellow legal pads, wandering around the office in her stockinged feet, getting coffee for herself, and chatting with the gang”. Each evening, the office staff would type up the day’s output for Gottlieb to read the next day. The only disagreement came when Bacall saw that while the front cover of By Myself was to carry two striking photos of Bacall, the back would feature her and her first husband, Humphrey Bogart.
Absolutely not, she exploded; this was her book, not his. That really pushed my buttons. “Listen, Bacall,” I said, “people want to know about you and him, and you’ve written hundreds of pages about him. It’s my job to sell your book, he’s the major selling point, and he’s going on the back cover.” “Fine,” she said. Like most actors, she responded positively to a strong directorial hand.
One of Gottlieb’s happiest collaborations has been with Toni Morrison, whom he convinced to quit her day job as a Random House editor, and devote herself to writing full time. After Knopf published Morrison’s second novel, Sula (1973), which Gottlieb likens to a sonnet – “it’s contained, it’s precise, it’s utterly controlled” – he told her she should open up and attempt something more ambitious. She then wrote Song of Solomon (1977), which was cited in her 1993 Nobel speech. Morrison is almost exactly Gottlieb’s age, and like him possesses a deep knowledge of the novelistic tradition. More important, he says, “we read the same way, so that when I make a suggestion, she instantly knows why, whether it’s about a sentence or involves a major structural issue”. When he suggested that the final third of one of her novels needed to be bulked up, “she saw why and solved the problem swiftly, perfectly, and untemperamentally”.
