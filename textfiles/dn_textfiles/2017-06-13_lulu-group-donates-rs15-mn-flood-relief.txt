Lulu Group donates  Rs.15 mn for flood relief

UAE-based retail giant Lulu Group has donated an amount of US$ 100,000 (Rs. 15 million) to the National Floods and Landslide Victims Operation in Sri Lanka.
S.J. Mohideen, Ambassador of Sri Lanka to the UAE, received the cheque from Yusuff Ali MA, Chairman of Lulu in Abu Dhabi, in the presence of senior officials of Lulu Group and the Sri Lankan Embassy, at a function held at its head office in Abu Dhabi.
According to Yusuf Ali MA, “UAE has always been and is at the forefront in helping needy people worldwide and we have always supported the game changing philanthropy initiatives launched by the visionary rulers of this great coutry. We are currently witnessing the ‘Year of Giving 2017’ initiative declared by Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the UAE, which further instills the value of giving and the importance of lending a helping hand to the disadvantaged people across the world.”
Lulu Group has recently opened its mega food processing and export unit, YAS Lanka Pvt. Ltd. in Katanayake and is also planning to enter Sri Lanka’s retail market in a big way.
