Sri Lanka Cricket salutes Sangakkara

Sri Lanka Cricket takes pleasure in saluting one of its greatest stars of recent times Kumar Sangakkara on the latest honour bestowed upon him by the county of Surrey by offering him an honorary life time membership in the club.
This follows Sangakkara's three year stint of playing for the county for the County Championship following the ex Sri Lankan cricketer's retirement from playing in the national team.
This act of appreciation follows Sangakkara's honorary membership at MCC a couple of years ago. “This is a great tribute to Sangakkara and to cricket in Sri Lanka,” said Sumathipala, president of SLC. “We at SLC are proud of him and value the prestige bestowed on him and thank him for the great ambassador he has become to the game of cricket in general and Sri Lanka in particular.
“Sri Lanka Cricket is lucky that we have such a wealth of talent and experience around it and considering the respect many of these cricketers enjoy, we hope that the likes of Sangakkara will give back to the national game their valued expertise and knowledge. We are truly proud of him.”
