Cleanliness is important
The most important reason for hair fall is dandruff and itchy scalp. Therefore, maintain good cleanliness for beautiful and healthy hair.
Avoid hot water
Skip hot water showers, because hot water will make your hair dry and brittle as it strips protective oils from your hair - says Dr. Suttar. Thus, prefer a temperature which is just a bit warmer than your body temperature.
For that shiny soft hair
Prepare a mixture of 1 cup of your daily conditioner and 2-3 tablespoons of honey. Apply this mixture evenly on your wet hair. Leave it for 30 minutes and wash it off thoroughly. This mixture will close down your hair's cuticle and give your hair that amazing shine.
 
Baking soda therapy
One of the beauty tips for hair is Baking soda therapy. Make a mixture of 3 tbsp. of baking soda and some water.
Rinse your hair with this solution after shampooing. Let it set in for at least 5 minutes before the final rinse. This therapy will help to remove the excess shampoo and styling product from your hair.
Don't wash your hair frequently
Wash your hair every 2-3 days, for proper regulation of natural hair oils. Washing your hair less often will also help regain your hair's naturalbody and luster.
Make your conditioner
For a protein packed conditioner, mix eggs and yogurt and rub it into your scalp. Leave on for five or 10 minutes, and then wash it off completely.
For strong hair
Use almond oil to treat dry and damaged hair.
It is a very simple procedure, pour some almond oil in a bowl and heat it for 40 seconds. Then evenly distribute on your hair. Leave it for 30 minutes and then rinse normally with shampoo and conditioner using cold water.
