Businessmen protest Galle traffic plan

A group of businessmen in Galle town staged a demonstration in protest against the new traffic plan introduced and implemented by Galle Municipal Council last week.
The protestors who started their protest walk from Aicemola Junction to Minuwangoda Junction on the Galle - Wackwella Road, demanded the abolition the new traffic plan as it hampers their businesses. They also claimed that the same plan was implemented on an earlier occasion and had to be withdrawn owing to the objection of the business community.
However, when contacted, Galle Mayor Priyantha Sahabandu said that the new traffic plan was an essential and long-awaited traffic operation strategy to reduce congestion on the Galle - Wackwella highway and the new plan was prepared and unanimously endorsed by the Galle Municipal Traffic Committee.
Subsequently the move on the new traffic plan was unanimously adopted at the General Assembly of Galle Municipal Council. The public commended the new traffic plan of the council. Only a very few traders on Galle - Wackwella Road are against the new traffic design. For the advantage of a few, we are not prepared to pull out from a scheme which is immensely beneficial for the majority of the general public, the Galle Mayor said.
Under the newly implemented traffic plan, on the Galle - Wackwella Road from Minuwangoda Junction, only one-way traffic from Wackwella towards the Galle Central Bus Stand would be allowed. Similarly, from Galle Central Bus Stand up to Muniwangoda Junction along Prof. Bandusena Ginasekara Mawatha (Havelock Place) only one-way traffic would be allowed.
At present, the traffic plan is implemented as a pilot project which will be duly legalized by a gazette notification very soon.
