Nobody can reverse country’s development programme: PM

 The United National Party would not allow anybody to reverse the development that has commenced under the good governance government for the people, UNP Leader and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister was speaking at the UNP May Day rally at Campbell Park, Borella yesterday.
The PM also said that the Rajapaksas of the previous government who are very well aware of their losses at future elections because of the government’s development projects, are attempting to disrupt the these programmes.
Premier Wickremesinghe further said that the UNP is becoming more popular and is confident of winning future elections.
“We accept that the UNP has not been able to solve the issues of the party supporters who were subjected to political vengeance,” Premier Wickremesinghe said.
“But, we request you to support development programmes initiated by the government.The previous Rajapaksa regime handed over us a bankrupt economy with a heavy burden of foreign loans. We had to make the economy stable and then initiate the development projects,”the Prime Minister said.

The Premier further said that the Rajapaksa regime put the country in a labyrinth of debt and burdened with loans to the tune of Rs.960 billion.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe added that by 2020, the country is bound to settle USD 15,000 million in loans.
“The previous government had no plans to settle the loans. They had lost the GSP Plus facility that the UNP government had obtained to export goods to Europe,” Premier Wickremesinghe said.
“As we promised during the election campaign, we obtained the GSP Plus facility again two weeks ago..
The Premier added that when exports are increased with the support of the GSP Plus facility, the country’s economy would be strengthened and problems of all would be solved. “Within this short period of time, we have been able to commence the development programme with work on the Volkswagen factory at Panala, Kalutara Tyre Factory,the Koggala garment factory and the construction of a number of tourist hotels,” the Premier said. “This year Japan has agreed to help develop Colombo, the Colombo Port, to construct another port north of the Colombo Port, development projects in Kandy,the agriculture and economic sectors etc.
The Premier also said that Japan has also promised to grant equipment for the Trincomalee Port, to develop the same port, Digitalise the Rupavahini and set up an LMP plant in Kerawalapitiya. He added that even the Indian government has promised to develop another LMG plant in Kerawalapitiya, develop the Trincomalee oil tanks in a joint venture. With this move the CPC also get an opportunity to access the Indian market. He also added that investors from India, Japan, Korea, China and many other countries are coming to Sri Lanka. “When the economy is developped, we would settle the loans with the profits,” Premier Wickremesinghe said. “The Rajapaksas though that we would not be able to develop the economy. Now they are afraid as they know they would not be able to win an election. Their dreams of two Poyas to set up a government. But, “I assure them that they would not be able to set up a government even after poyas of two centuries,”the PM said.
The Prime Minister also said that the previous regime that shot Roshen Chanaka dead and people at Weliweriya has no moral right to talk of workers’ rights and people’s rights. The Premier also said that those of the previous regime attempt to disrupt the government’s development programmes and we assure that this government would not allow them to do so in anyway. The Premier added that the UNP would continue its struggle until 2020 and take the country foward.
