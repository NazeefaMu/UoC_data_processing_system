Combat training in SL for Malaysian security personnel

Malaysian Security and Enforcement personnel will undergo sea combat training in Sri Lanka to strengthen and upgrade their skills in maritime security control.
Eastern Sabah Security Command (Esscom) Commander Datuk Hazani Ghazali said the training would be conducted next year with Sri Lanka’s security forces.
Dubbed Sea Combat Course, the training is aimed at equipping the Esscom team with added skills.
“The expertise of the Sri Lankans in safeguarding their waters are recognised worldwide,” he told reporters at the Esscom monthly gathering at the Police marine base. Hazani said about 20 personnel from three agencies, the Police, Armed Forces, and the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency, would participate in the intensive training. Source: New Straits Times
