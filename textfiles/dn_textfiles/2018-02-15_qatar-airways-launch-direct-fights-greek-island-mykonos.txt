Qatar Airways to launch direct fights to Greek Island of Mykonos

Qatar Airways is pleased to announce that it will launch direct flights to Mykonos, Greece from May 2018. The beautiful island of Mykonos will be the third Greek destination in the award-winning airline’s rapidly expanding global network, following the launch of direct service to Thessaloniki in March 2018 
Mykonos, one of the Cyclades islands in the Aegean Sea, is famous for its white buildings set against stunning turquoise waters. With its cosmopolitan and vibrant atmosphere, Mykonos is also an ideal starting point from which to begin an island-hopping Greek summer holiday.
Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive, Akbar Al Baker, said: “Mykonos has long been one of our most sought-after European destinations, and we are very proud to be the first Gulf carrier to serve Mykonos directly. The island’s central location among the Cyclades makes it an extremely attractive holiday destination. We look forward to offering holidaymakers the convenience of direct service to this enchanting island this summer.”
Four weekly seasonal flights to Mykonos Island National Airport will be operated by an Airbus A320, featuring 12 seats in Business Class and 132 seats in Economy Class.
The award-winning airline also recently announced that it will launch non-stop flights to Thessaloniki, its second destination in Greece, from March 2018. The four-times weekly new service between Doha and Thessaloniki will also be operated by an Airbus A320 aircraft, featuring 12 seats in Business Class and 132 seats in Economy Class. Qatar Airways also offers three daily flights to Athens.
Passengers travelling to Greece will enjoy Qatar Airways unrivalled five-star service, both on the ground and on-board. As well as enjoying the award-winning in-flight service on board the Skytrax Airline of the Year 2017, passengers will also have access to Oryx One, Qatar Airways’ in-flight entertainment system offering the latest blockbuster movies, TV box sets, music, games and much more.
Qatar Airways currently holds the title of ‘Airline of The Year’ as awarded by the prestigious 2017 Skytrax World Airline Awards. In addition to being voted Best Airline by travellers from around the world, Qatar’s national carrier also won a raft of other major awards at the ceremony, including ‘Best Airline in the Middle East,’ ‘World’s Best Business Class’ and ‘World’s Best First Class Airline Lounge.’
