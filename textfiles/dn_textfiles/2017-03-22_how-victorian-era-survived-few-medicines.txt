How Victorian era survived with a few medicines

In 1837 as industrial cities cropped up in Britain the people started to move from country to town side for jobs. That caused health hazards during the early Victorian era. Houses were built very close depriving light or ventilation. Rubbish was thrown into streets and rivers. Drinking water collected from streams and rivers into which sewers drained.
For the first time, Cholera came up in the town Clerkenwell, London. Cholera spread fast due to unhealthy condition in mid 18th Century, toilets were not flushed off and maintained. Cesspits were emptied near houses to dung heaps. Also the illnesses such as typhus, tuberculosis, measles and whooping cough arose.
Even the doctors never knew about germs. They attended to surgery without sterilizing their instruments.
The drug called opium made from poppies was often used to stop pain. Dr Simpson (1847) discovered chloroform for anesthesia. In this era a mask like one soaked in chloroform was put over the patient’s face. The patient breathed in the chloroform and went to sleep. Queen Victoria used chloroform to kill the pain of childbirth when her son was born in 1853, When her ninth baby was due in 1857, she had said “we are having this baby and we are having chloroform.” After that, the use of anesthetics was widely accepted. Even with new inventions, people died of germs. Two out of every five, patients died of infections after operations.
In 1864 a French Chemist called Louis Pasteur proved that infections were caused by germs. A surgeon in Glasgow called Joseph Lister in end of the 18th century used this to invent a spray. This killed germs during operations performed. Also Lister soaked his hands and instruments in carbolic acid before operations In 1880s it was believed that an operation is successful if the germs have been killed.
In 19th century tuberculosis was a common disease that killed people Aspirator (new invention) was used to drain off the liquid from lungs. By 1900 laws were passed to keep towns cleaner and healthier and by 1900 Cholera no longer existed in Britain.
In 1858 a law was passed that only qualified people can work as Doctors. Training of nurses commenced. A writer called Edward Harrison found that in three small towns in Britain sixty nine persons had practiced as doctors for money without proper education. A law called the Medical Act was passed in 1858.
Florence Nightingale (1820 – 1910) from a rick family entered into the nursing stream in Germany. She with the support of 38 nurses assisted the soldiers in their wounds and sicknesses. She kept the hospitals clean. She started training schools for nurses. They were taught even languages to read the medicines written in different languages. By 1890 nursing was seen as a suitable job for women.
The first successful removal of an appendix was done in 1880 with the assistance of new inventions. Aspirin was fist sold in shops in 1899.
Many hospitals were built in England. During the later stages of Victorian times, the ophthalmoscope was invented. The respirator too was invented to inhale oxygen for breathing difficulties.
This was assisted to four patients to use at once. During this time all patients of all sources of illnesses in all ages were treated in one ward. But, in 1852, Dr West opened the London Hospital for sick children separately in Great Ormond Street, thereafter this was followed up by other countries. In 1838 ENT Hospital was opened in London and in 1837 Skin Hospital was opened.
This helped doctors to follow one route of illness. In 1900 paid hospitals were introduced for the rich. Asylums and Dentist hospitals were put up. In 1895 a German Scientist called Wilhelm Rontgen found X-rays. In 1898 radium was discovered by Marie Curie who died of radium burns.
