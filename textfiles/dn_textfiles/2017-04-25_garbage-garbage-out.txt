Garbage in, garbage out

The natural stink bomb exploded at Meethotamulla and its tragedy seems to have propelled a valuable point for a serious discussion not only among the intelligentsia but also among every Jack and Jill, Tom, Dick and Harry at the tea kiosks. Pardon me if I have happened to hurt the sentiments of any one by any name in my list. All the names are from the English nomenclature and my mind goes back to the English rule in Sri Lanka.
Now I am compelled by the circumstances to contemplate why the British rulers had not given us freedom for such a long time. Cleanliness of the English gentlemen is unquestionable. Our half-naked fakir from India got the point right in hand and he launched his non-violence movement exploiting this specific disposition of the English gentleman. Whole India was spread with human excreta and made the country very stinky. The man made stink bomb India drove them away to their stench free land of their own. In giving freedom to Sri Lanka, they might have thought that ours was a nation that we couldn’t manage our things properly. It seems the ground reality behind the Meethotamulla tragedy.
Meethotamulla tragedy
The reaction of the members of the legislature and the general public drives home the idea that both parties are not matured enough to take quick actions for an issue of this nature. The resilience of the people of America proved the world their integrity and the national mind set beyond doubt when they were bombed. Sri Lanka is a country lagging behind most of the other countries in many an instance. Our country is poignantly lacking the knowledge and experience to draft even an application for Grade One school admissions. Every year, so many amendments are made to the annual budget. Whole administration seems to be in an inescapable labyrinth. Almost all the governments have been entangled in this perennial tragedy.
The latest tragedy which has raised its ugly head seems to me not anything of that sort, but the grave crisis democracy is facing in Sri Lanka. Meethotamulla tragedy could have been really averted if the relevant authorities had taken the necessary actions in the nick of time. That is history. The die is cast.
The most chaotic situation is that, the very same rulers, not the public, should take the responsibly for dragging the people into an undemocratic path. At the drop of a hat, people acquire the public highway without an iota of obedience to the law of the country. Public are inconvenienced almost all the days of the month.
During the last few years, what we noticed was that the oratory skills of some self-appointed patriots and unpractical legal eagles, not to mention some literary fossils and a dozen of pseudo intellectuals were dragging the country into an abysmal depth of political ruin. In this light, the writer thinks it is high time to open a discussion on the democratic ideals that we have to uphold as a nation.
It is undeniable that oratory is only the beginning of free speech. It could be employed as a medium to reach an end. That end tool is stupidly used by our politically immature leaders like the same way how proverbially a monkey would use the razor. Examination of opinions is adroitly done by the national press today. For that, our encomiums should go to the learned editors of the national newspapers whose papers play the vital role of the watch dog, veritably.
Examination of opinions is a fundamental necessity of man and its immediate functioning has become a vital issue in the present context because some sections of the society have recently started to abuse it in the worst manner even by repeatedly saying that they would topple the democratically elected government by muscle power. They are really talking to the gallery, yet its threat to the sentiments of the right thinking rational minded citizens is immense.
Power hungry politicians
Most of the members of the legislature and their cohorts have come down to ZIMRI level. Freedom of expression has to be guarded as the country is passing through a turbulent time. Management of the government at turbulent times needs constant vigilance and rational thinking. Freedom of the ass shouldn’t be the maxim. That is the example our ancestors have put into good use.
The law-abiding far sighted senior citizens ought to save a peaceful country for the posterity. Expression of opinions should essentially bear the seal of correction, not creating chaos in the country at a time, the concerned parties are making a discernible attempt to take the country out of a treacherous bog. The emerging international scenario of the unprecedented international cooperation should be harnessed to the fullest. Liberal democracy should be taken in its true spirit.
Socrates once said, ‘The unexamined life is unfit to be lived by man’. These great philosophical saying are grossly unheeded by power hungry politicians and their goons. Liberty is sanctified by these concepts. If the present hooligans pay an iota of attention to the current state of the country they have to tolerate the errors to serve democracy in the long run.
It is high time to inculcate the democratic values in the mind of the people and the misled politicians because the benefits of free expressions are many. If the opposing parties could be taken to a common forum and their opinions are made to listen and discussed deeply they could be ceased to become children before the intelligentsia. It is the need of the hour. It is mandatory in the present context. Unheeded, our men seem to becoming savages and uncivilized men in the near future at this rate. The real value of democracy may become vibrant if the examination of opinions becomes a constant exercise. Vituperative politics should come to a virtual end. Preservation of democracy of a county depends on understanding the principles of democracy by the people. It is regrettable that even the legislators seem to have forgotten its cardinal principles and the Salient features. MARK TWAIN in his well-acclaimed novel ‘THE PRINCE AND THE PAUPER’ says that people change in every ten years. Our leaders who have mastered law and philosophies engage in foul verbal fights and openings of toilets and other negligible undertakings without maintaining their intellectual decorum. It is very calamitous to a country in the long run. Opposition is indispensable. It is a vital necessity in the smooth functioning of a democracy. Moreover, it is constitutional. Yet the abuse of being opposed is proved very catastrophic, because the views expressed by the opponents seem to be rubbish.
Democracy is poignantly turned upside down by the demi-gods of democracy in Sri Lanka. It is the conundrum. Our wounds are getting cured from gross autocracy very slowly after one and a half decades. The country is in the right direction and democracy is playing its role vibrantly. Agitations at every junction, demonstrations, strikes.
Work to rules, sick notes, sabotage, going to GENEVA and getting lost there, mud throwing, hooting to the respected parliamentarians, law suits and many other democratic functions are in array, unprecedentedly. Democracy seems to be repleting. Yet, some dark clouds seem to be looming over us. The frightening murderous drums are heard at the distance. I pray God for the safety of my sons and daughters.
As the writer has repeatedly mentioned in this article, an effective opposition is the need of the hour, yet it must follow the basic principles of democracy. I have sometimes observed the opposition behaving like unruly mobs. A democratically elected government should be made to govern by consent. It is the cornerstone of democracy. Getting governed by coercion is unacceptable and should be vehemently crushed for the welfare of the majority. In this aspect, the party in power should have the majority.
The president and the immediate confidantes leave no stone unturned to meet that demand. Yet, it doesn’t seem fruitful. The country is at stake. Democracy is sitting on a volcano, literally. Under these circumstances, the party in power should not hurt the sentiments of the opposition for silly matters. Some uncontrolled culvert mouths do this perennial crime almost as a habit. Sometimes, it runs in the family. It is ruinous. Listening to the minority in democracy is a noble aspect. Their constructive criticism is vital for the smooth functioning of democracy.
There seems a ray of hope in the eastern sky. So, let’s be optimistic till democracy takes its noble image in the promised land. It is very difficult to teach old dogs new tricks. Yet we must give democracy a try.
‘Old order changeth, yielding place to new.’
