Good taboo in fiction

It’s easy to sneer at the Literary Review’s Bad Sex in Fiction Award – sneering at the sneerers, as it were – but it’s no lie that writing well about sex is difficult, and perhaps more difficult in prose than in poetry. I think there are three main reasons for this. Firstly, the vocabulary: the words for human genitalia, when they aren’t puerile or bluntly medical, are semantically loaded with enough sexual-political freight to capsize any sentence. Secondly, the activity itself: however pleasant it may feel to those involved, most variations of the sexual act are pretty obviously open to ridicule. The third reason relates to those feelings. The brain may be “the largest sexual organ”, but orgasm switches important parts of it off. We barely know ourselves when having sex; how should we be expected to write it?
Nevertheless, good sex writing does exist – and here, sticking to the parameters of the award, I essentially mean the sex scene in the literary novel or short story, ignoring outright pornography or its kissing cousin, erotica. Which is not to say the scene should not be arousing, but its primary object should be to serve the story. The writing should teach us about the characters. Ideally, it should teach us about sex, too.
Physical descriptions
One recent novel that would surely be nominated for a Good Sex in Fiction Award, if such a thing existed, is Eimear McBride’s The Lesser Bohemians (2016). McBride’s book, about an Irish drama student who has a relationship with an older British actor, refuses to recognize a barrier between what might be termed “sex acts” and any other part of the characters’ interaction – and further buries the physical descriptions in McBride’s distinctive prose style:
Bit harder? he wonders. I. I. But the mouth on my breasts then – tickle and strange delight of being seen – surprises me, if not to everything, to something. Like first foot inveigle toward what this could be. With the look in his eye. With his body in me. Going and going and harder until Oh fuck, he says Hold still, I’m way too close, any chance you are?
This reminds me of, firstly, Niall Griffiths’s intense novel about a sado-masochistic relationship, Kelly + Victor (2002) and, further back, James Salter’s A Sport and a Pastime (1967). Salter’s novel of a young expat American’s affair with a French shopgirl in provincial Autun is a frequent reference point for good sex writing. Much of its lyricism comes from the fact that the details of the affair are imagined by the narrator, who seems as much in love with the relentlessly debonair Philip as he is with Anne-Marie. Here they are, in a typical bedroom scene:
With a touch like flowers, she is gently tracing the base of his cock, driven by now all the way into her, touching his balls, and beginning to writhe slowly beneath him in a sort of obedient rebellion while in his own dream he rises a little and defines the moist rim of her cunt with his fingers, and as he does, he comes like a bull.
“Like a bull” is a false step, to be sure, but this contrast between unabashed, precise physical description and more unexpected, imaginative leaps is characteristic of Salter’s approach to the subject. The image of the bull pales next to another animal simile in Salter’s last novel, All That Is (2013). In it he describes a man as coming “like a drinking horse”, so falling foul of Gibbs’s Law of Reversible Similes: if you can describe something as being like something else, then that comparison should work equally well in reverse. I am yet to see a horse drink “like a man coming”, and hope I never will.
Self-deprecation
You can see a lot of Salter in the sexual adventures of Geoff Dyer’s novelistic heroes, who for all their frustrations and self-deprecation have immensely enviable sex lives. In Jeff in Venice, Death in Varanasi (2009), the titular freelance journalist and the woman of his dreams have barely met at the Venice Biennale before they are having sex.
He licked down her stomach and then moved lower so that he could smell and see her. She reached down to hold her underwear aside.
He stayed there motionless, inhaling deeply through his nose, exhaling through his open mouth. Only his breath touched her. Neither of them moved.
He tilted his head and she moved from the edge of the desk, bending her legs slightly until she was almost touching his tongue and then was.
She kissed his face with her cunt, moving over his mouth, moving in synch with him.
