Baker Tilly Int’l unveils visual identity, brand positioning

Baker Tilly International, a leading international audit firm, which has its presence in Sri Lanka, will today unveil a new logo, visual identity and a new purpose – ‘Now for Tomorrow’ - as part of the ongoing evolution of the Baker Tilly brand.
Baker Tilly is affiliated and represented in Sri Lanka by Baker Tilly Edirisinghe and Company, which is a separate legal entity.
Speaking on the new identity, Ted Verkade, CEO of the network, said, “Beyond our expertise and proven capability to serve global clients, we want the Baker Tilly brand to be synonymous with our commitment to building great relationships and having great conversations to ensure great futures. This is what sets us apart. We make decisions now, to shape a successful tomorrow for our clients, our people, our profession and our communities.”
“Growth is at the heart of our business. Our new symbol is inspired by organic growth patterns found in nature. It signifies our capacity to be agile and adaptable to the unique needs of our clients. The wordmark is in all lowercase letters to represent our personal and approachable nature. The removal of the space between Baker and Tilly signifies our cohesive network.”
The emphasis on a new brand identity reflects Baker Tilly International’s desire for a more unified representation across its global network. “Our decision to make this change now is because over the last two decades the Baker Tilly network has continued to grow and evolve and this needs to be reflected in our branding. A consistent brand position makes it easier for people to appreciate who we are, what we do, and how we operate across markets,” said Ben Lloyd, Baker Tilly International’s Chief Operating Officer.
The new visual identity goes ‘live’ on December 7, with more than 120 firms unveiling the new identity in their marketplace.
