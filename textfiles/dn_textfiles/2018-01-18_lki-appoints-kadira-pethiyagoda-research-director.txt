LKI appoints Kadira Pethiyagoda as Research Director

The Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute of International Relations and Strategic Studies (LKI), Sri Lanka’s leading foreign policy think tank, has appointed Dr. Kadira Pethiyagoda as its first
Research Director of LKI’s Global Governance Programme.
In addition to his role at LKI, Dr. Pethiyagoda is a Nonresident Fellow at the Brookings Doha Center. His research at Brookings has focused on Asia's relations with the Middle East, drawing on his experience in both policymaking and academia.
Dr. Pethiyagoda obtained his Ph.D. in international relations from the University of Melbourne, where his doctoral research resulted in a thesis on the influence of dominant cultural values on India’s foreign policy.
In 2012-2013, he was a visiting scholar at St. Antony’s College at Oxford University, and in 2013, a research associate at Oxford’s Institute for Ethics, Law and Armed Conflict. He is currently writing two books: one on Indian foreign policy; and another on Indian culture for a mainstream audience, for which he won manuscript sponsorship.
Previously, Dr. Pethiyagoda worked as an advisor to an Australian Shadow Foreign Minister and advised other parliamentarians on foreign policy matters, and also worked as a senior country advisor at Australia’s Refugee Tribunal. He has also served as a diplomat and foreign service officer, covering bilateral relations with countries in Asia and Europe, and undertaking trade analysis and public diplomacy.
LKI's Global Governance programme analyses issues relating to Sri Lanka’s international relations, international law, and security. These involve maritime issues, international dispute resolutions transitional justice, international human rights norms, sustainable development, and Sri Lanka’s role in the United Nations, as well as Sri Lanka’s cultural relations in sports, religion, and the arts.
LKI is a think tank that analyses Sri Lanka’s international relations and strategic interests, to provide insights and recommendations that advance justice, peace, prosperity, and sustainability. The Institute reflects the vision of the late Lakshman Kadirgamar by promoting the country’s intellectual profile in foreign policy research and engagement.
