UNDP, Biodiversity Sri Lanka enter into collaborative partnership

The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Sri Lanka and the Biodiversity Sri Lanka entered into a collaborative partnership with the UNDP as its first associate member. It is to enable the UNDP Sri Lanka and the Biodiversity Sri Lanka to build a long lasting relationship to enhance biodiversity conservation performance by the country's corporate sector.
The Biodiversity Sri Lanka (BSL), an entirely private sector owned and driven platform, with 63 corporate entities, was established to promote strong engagement of the corporate sector in biodiversity and environmental conservation issues in Sri Lanka. Leveraging on the competitive advantages of the BSL and the UNDP, this partnership will now enable both entities to contribute substantively to influence the policy arena, both public and corporate, in using best practices in conservation standards and sustainable development.
UNDP Sri Lanka Country Director Jorn Sorensen said: "The partnership is a promising and innovative collaboration that has enormous potential to energise efforts towards biodiversity conservation for sustainable human development”.
Both organisations had identified potential areas of engagement and a set of joint activities on policy innovation, social innovation initiatives, SME engagement, environment sustainability and disaster resilience, tourism and bio diversity.
Biodiversity Sri Lanka Director Board Chairman Dilhan C. Fernando said: “The Biodiversity Sri Lanka looks forward to forging a successful working partnership with the UNDP to actively involve the private sector in taking forth the national biodiversity conservation agenda”.
The UNDP Sri Lanka and the Biodiversity Sri Lanka will develop this new and exciting partnership as a best practice for other organisations to follow and join hands for similar causes.
