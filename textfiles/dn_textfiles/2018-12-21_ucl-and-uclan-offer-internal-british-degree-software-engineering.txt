UCL and UCLan offer Internal British Degree in Software Engineering

UCL (Universal College Lanka) has partnered with the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan), UK to offer an Internal British Degree in Software Engineering to students to graduate from a reputed UK university while residing in Sri Lanka.
The prestigious University of Central Lancashire, which celebrated its 190th Anniversary this year, is the earliest established British University to offer degree programmes in Sri Lanka. Currently ranked 67th(Guardian University Guide 2018), UCLan is regarded as one of the Top UK Universities for Entrepreneurs. It is also the first UK modern Higher Education institution to appear in the QS World University Rankings and is currently ranked in the Top 3.7% of all universities worldwide.
The UCL Software Engineering Team has sharedkey insights into why the UCLan degree programme is the best choice for aspiring students in Sri Lanka. Students so far in the programme have done exceedingly well, with 100% pass rates and high average marks across all modules taught.
Students could enter the degree programme after A-Levels or after O-Levels by completing a Foundation Programme, or also upon completion of Pearson BTEC qualification such as Higher National Certificate/Diploma.
Dean of Academic Affairs, Dr. Dhananjay Kulkarni, (PhD - University of California, USA), said, “Lecturers at UCL are hired after a rigorous interview process and hence, from day 1 all students receive the best possible support and guidance inside the classroom. We also ensure that students who need additional guidance are supported through additional classes or tutorials to improve their basic knowledge, if necessary.”
