Public officials bound to execute Govt. decisions - MP

Ratnapura District parliamentarian W.D.J. Seneviratne yesterday, said public officials are bound to execute decisions taken by the government of PM Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Seneviratne urged government servants not to be misled by media campaigns launched by UNP MP Akila Viraj Kariyawasam who said that public officials are bound to implement their decisions.
Addressing a press conference held at the Prime Minister’s office, Seneviratne said the government will bring in a Vote on Account to cover government expenses.
He said that funds have been allocated for government expenses through the Budget till January and the Finance Minister can allocate funds for Ministries through the Consolidated Fund.
“The President appointed former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister under powers vested with him by the Constitution.
This appointment was made in compliance with the Constitution,” he added.
Seneviratne said that President Maithripala Sirisena appointed the former President as Prime Minister after taking the people’s opinion into account.
“The economy had collapsed.
The country’s assets were being sold for a song and the country was facing serious danger in terms of security.
This situation needed to be arrested,” the MP said.
He said that the UNP did not seek court orders against the appointment of the former President as Prime Minister and the Speaker also recognized Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister.
The Speaker had also provided facilities needed for the new Prime Minister in Parliament.

The Speaker had also provided facilities needed for the new Prime Minister in Parliament.
“In the meantime, Parliament was dissolved and the UNP filed petitions seeking a Supreme Court order annulling the Gazzette notification through which parliament was dissolved.
He said that the Speaker changed his stance after the Supreme Court issued an interim order suspending the Gazzette Notification until the final determination on the petition is delivered by the court on December 7.
“The Speaker earned the respect of all parties in the House and we had trust in him and we thought that he would discharge his duties impartially and independently. His conduct in the Chamber on November 14 cannot be accepted,” Seneviratne added.
He said that Speaker could have discharged his duties with responsibility . His conduct in the chamber led to the disputes and clashes among the parliamentarians.
“We stressed the importance of respecting Standing Orders. How does he remove a Prime Minister of the country by taking a voice vote ? he queried.
He expressed concern and questioned the ingenuity and proficiency of Speaker Karu Jayasuriya for taking a motion of no confidence against a Prime Minister of an incumbent government in post- haste.
Seneviratne said no one can predict the Court’s final determination on the Gazzette notification issued by the President dissolving parliament.
“The UNP has no option other than sit in the Opposition, if court upholds that the dissolution is legal and constitutional,”he said.
“The UNP wants to drive the country towards anarchy but their dreams will never come true”, he said.
