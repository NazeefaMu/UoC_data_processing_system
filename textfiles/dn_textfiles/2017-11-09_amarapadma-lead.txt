Amarapadma into lead

Following up on a creditable 69 in Round 1, seasoned campaigner and past Sri Lanka Open Champion, M. Amaradapma improved with a 3 under 68 to nose ahead at the halfway mark. Another seasoned campaigner N. Ranga had the best score of 4 under par 67 to grab the 2nd spot and push first round leader Chalitha Pushpika, who came back with an even par 71, into 3rd place.
Lurking in the rest of the pack is Number 1 Ranker and Asia Pacific Qualifier B.A. Sanjeewa who improved by 5 strokes with a 3 under 68 to move up 5 places from 10 th to 5 th position and is now tied with first round leader Sisira Kumara who seemed to have slipped in better weather and shot a disappointing 2 over par going into the cut, which only 15 players got through.
