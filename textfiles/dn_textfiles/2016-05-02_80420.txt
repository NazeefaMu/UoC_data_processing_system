Proposed Rs 10,000 basic salary hike for govt.servants complete by 2020: Minister Maddumabandara

 
 The proposed Rs 10,000 hike to the basic salary of government servants would be complete by 2020, Public Administration and Management Minister Ranjith Maddumabandara said.
The minister was addressing over 100,000 UNP supporters at the UNP May Day rally in Colombo yesterday.
“This year, Rs 2,500 will be added to your basic salary,” he said while adding that the government would soon introduce legislation to make Rs 10,000 as the minimum wage for all.
He further said that all workers would be allowed to work until 60 years of age with no conditions attached.
“Yesterday, we introduced a circular allowing retired government servants to be eligible for the Agrahara Insurance Scheme. We will also increase the amount given though Agrahara.” Maddumabandara said. Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake admitted that they have been slow in prosecuting the criminals of the Rajapaksa regime,
“People ask us where the benefits are after one and a half years in government Why have we not caught any of the criminals” he said, but added, “By the next May Day rally, we will have caught all the criminals and they will kneel before you”.
He further said,“Mahinda Rajapaksa goes to Thailand and meets Udayanga Weeratunga who is wanted by our Police. We ask him, why are you mixing with criminals
"Weeratunga gives Rajapaksa a brief case of money and Basil Rajapaksa is now handing out that money from village to village. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa has now gone to America but he refuses to come to the FCID. We ask the police, why are these people still out”, Minister Karunanayake said.
Karunanayake however assured that they had struck no deal with the Rajapaksas.
The UNP which also chose to make racial harmony and unity as a key factor in their rally, had SLMC leader Rauff Hakeem calling all to support a new Constitution which would be acceptable to all,
“On 5th May, Parliament will once again sit as a Constitutional Council to discuss a new Constitution.
"But, certain factions are trying to ruin this valuable opportunity by targeting minority leaders. As a minority leader I also say that we must not use any fiery speeches to simply rouse the sentiments of the masses and act carefully”, said Hakeem. Recently appointed Chairman of the Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam however insisted that they would not let their hard won victory go to waste but push forward to govern the country for the next 10-15 years.
“Mahinda Rajapaksa has gone to Kirulapone to simply get back into power, so that he can continue with his corrupt ways. We will not let that happen,”he said.
He added that the UNP government would ensure that every worker gets a fair wage for decent work.
Telecommunications and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando said it was only 5 months since the budget had been passed and asked the people not to think about short term benefits but a long term future.
Health Minister Dr.Rajitha Senaratne who also joined the UNP rally asked that the people support the Ranil-Maithri duo at the next Presidential election in 2020 too while targeting a UNP general election,
“Neither Mahinda Rajapaksa nor another Prabhakaran will be able to rule this country ever again,” said Senaratne.
