Material to be supplied directly to children

School uniform material will be supplied directly to children from next year instead of the earlier system of providing a stamp for them to purchase it from textile dealers.
The Education and Higher Education Ministry is making arrangements to supply the material before the end of February next year as directed by the Minister, a Ministry statement said.
The Ministry has decided to change over to the system of distributing uniform material directly to children in keeping with a policy decision approved by the Cabinet on November 22, the statement said.
This decision was taken to overcome many discrepancies which occurred during the programme of distributing stamps which was introduced from 2016. Among them was that the Ministry had to spend an additional Rs. 550 million in 2018.
Although material was purchased from local producers though open tenders earlier, the system of stamps involved the drain of over Rs. 1 billion to foreign countries for purchase of material. Since material had not been purchased from local producers for the last three years, local industries faced imminent closure causing loss of employment to a large number of workers. Printing of stamps also involved an additional expenditure of Rs. 10 million.
Previously, high-quality uniform material was distributed after subjecting stocks to quality tests, but most of the material supplied to students by businessmen under the stamp system was of low quality.
Furthermore, parents had to waste time and bear additional costs to purchase material under the stamp system.
