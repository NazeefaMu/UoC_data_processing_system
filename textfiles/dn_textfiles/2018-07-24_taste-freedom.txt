Taste of freedom

Despite coming under constant criticism of the politicians in the North, the Sri Lanka Army continues to render their contribution towards the reconciliation process and wellbeing of the people in Jaffna. They are engaged in providing assistance to the people of the North rebuild their lives, improve their livelihood and even in the education of the younger generation.
With the aim of promoting religious harmony, the army assisted in organising a multi-religious conference with the participation of the religious leaders of all faiths. Further discussions were also initiated with the senior citizens of the North, the Chamber of Commerce (Jaffna) and also the business community on the issues facing the Northern region, with the hope of assisting in addressing these issues.
For the first time in history, a dialog with the Maha Nayaka Thera of the Asgiri Chapter and multi-religious leaders in Jaffna was organised with the mediation of the Jaffna Security Force Headquarters in August last year, in order to discuss their difficulties.
Further, under their community responsibility initiative and with the aim of promoting religious harmony, the Jaffna Security Force Headquarters also initiated a project to renovate 100 Hindu Kovils in the North. This project commenced in 2018 under the guidance of the Jaffna Security Force Commander Maj. Gen. Darshana Hettiarachchi on the instructions of Army Commander Lt. Gen. Mahesh Senanayake.
The Army had organised the Unduwap Perahera of the Sri Naga Viharaya in December 2017, exhibiting many cultural aspects of Buddhism and Hinduism, which attracted a large crowd. This event included not just the Buddhist cultural troops but a large number of Hindu cultural items were also part of this perahera.
Vesak celebrations
Meanwhile, the Vesak celebration which was organised by the Jaffna Security Force Headquarters though not viewed by some Tamil leaders very favourably has gained popularity among the public of the North. Judging from the crowd turnout, it is no doubt a novel source of entertainment for the Jaffna people. The Vesask Dansela this year, catered to over 15,000 people on each of the days it was held. The Vesak pandols on display also attracted large crowds. According to one of the visitors to the Vesak zone, both the young and old come for the Vesak celebrations as they enjoy seeing the lanterns and pandols and it also gives them an understanding of the Buddhist culture.
“Previously, if a person from Jaffna needed to witness the Vesak celebrations, they would have to travel either to Anuradhapura or Colombo, but now with the Vesak celebrations being held in the North, the Northern people too could enjoy this festival,” said one of the residents. Sinhalese and Tamils alike joined in the celebrations and enjoyed the entertainment and meals, clearly indicating that the ordinary people, be it Sinhala or Tamil, have no grudges and they want to live in harmony and peace.
Further, a food festival was also organised in Jaffna under the Army’s reconciliation promotion drive, including various dishes from every region of the country. This gave the Jaffna residents a chance to taste food from every other region in the country.
In addition, Christmas was also celebrated in grand style in the North under the organising efforts of the Jaffna Security Force Headquarters. The Jaffna Bishop and several other dignitaries participated in the Christmas celebrations.
Upgrading the social status of the people of the North and providing housing for the displaced, the Sri Lanka Army has constructed 133 houses for the internally displaced persons (IDPs) at Keerimalai which was handed over to the recipients on October 31, 2016.
Financial assistance was provided by an army officer, as a goodwill gesture to construct a house for a deserving family in Periyavilan, Jaffna which was completed and handed over to that family on September 26, 2017.
The Army also constructed another 25 houses for the internally displaced persons at Keerimalai and handed them over to the recipients on March 30, 2018.
The Army also provided assistance to construct another 30 houses to resettle the internally displaced persons at the Thelippalai area and these houses were also handed over to the recipients on April 5, 2018.
Further another six houses are currently under construction in the Karainagar area being built by the Army. A house is also being built for a university student, Suriya Kumar and his family by the army.
Housing project
The foundation stone was laid by the Jaffna Commander on May 11, 2018 to initiate a housing project of 30 houses for deserving families in Kytes. These houses are being constructed with the assistance of the ‘Daham Pahana’ foundation by its founder Brother Charles Thomas.
Assisting the Northern people in their farming activities, the army took the initiative to provide tractors and military personnel to families that needed assistance to plough their lands for agricultural purposes on November 01, 2017.
Assisting the disabled civilians in the North they also initiated several programmes to provide artificial limbs to those who were disabled. The army donated limbs for the disabled at Aiyakachchi on October 17, 2017, and also donated artificial limbs to the disabled persons at a ceremony in Aiyakachchi in collaboration with the Centre for Handicapped – Kundasale on June 6, 2018.
In June 2018, four artificial limbs were donated to disabled persons through the assistance of the Daham Pahana founder Brother Charles Thomas.
Not just limiting their assistance in the day-to-day activities, the army has also initiated programmes to help the environment in the North. With this aim, the army initiated a special project on October 21, 2017, to protect the coastal belt in collaboration with the Coast Conservation Department.
Initiating a coconut plantation project in 2017, the army provided each family five coconut seedlings to be planted on their private lands. In an initiative to plant 100,000 coconut plants in the North, the army planted 10,000 coconut seedlings so far this year in the lands occupied by the army in collaboration with the Coconut Development Board. Their target is to complete the planting of the 100,000 coconut plants by the end of this year.
Further, a Palmyra planting project was also initiated in 2017 and so far 15,000 Palmyra seeds have been planted in the North with the collaboration of the Palmyra Development Board.
A reforestation project was initiated in 2017 in collaboration with the Forest Department and so far 7,000 plants have been planted by the army during last year.
The ex-combatants are a group of people in the North who were most affected both during and after the war. Having put their lives on the line during the war, after the war ended, most of them found that they were not welcome in their own villages and most did not want to employ them.
However, having undergone the rehabilitation programme organised by the government, most of these combatants who knew only the art of combat, learnt other employment skills. Hence, under the livelihood assistance to these ex-combatants, the army had donated 15 sewing machines to female ex-combatants to assist them in self-employment opportunities on March 28, 2018.
In addition, 7,500 coconut seedlings were also donated to low income families by the DahamPahana foundation, where each family was provided with five coconut seedlings each.
The Daham Pahana foundation also donated sewing materials to 20 low income families to the value of Rs. 20,000 each for every family to assist them in improving their earning capacity.
Speaking to the Daily News, the Security Force Headquarters Jaffna Commander Maj. Gen. Darshana Hettiarachchi said his aim was to promote the educational standards of the children of the North so that they would not resort to violent activities in future. “These people have undergone tremendous hardships during the 30 years of war. Most of these children know nothing but violence and bloodshed. This must stop and the only way to stop this culture of violence and hatred is to educate the younger generation so that they would be more knowledgeable and no one will be able to brainwash them. In the past Jaffna was considered an educated and knowledgeable society. They were hardworking and excelled in their studies. My aim is to once again, promote these youngsters to focus on their education and be part of building a strong and educated Sri Lanka.”
Focus on education
With this intention, an appreciation ceremony was organised on December 7, 2017 to felicitate the students who excelled at the Year 5 Scholarship Examination and obtained the all island 1st and 2nd places in the Tamil medium. An appreciation of 204 students who had obtained 9 ‘A’ passes at the GCE O/L examination in 2016 was also held. They were presented with books, stationary school bags and branded wrist watches at a ceremony held on July 29, 2017 in order to encourage them to pursue higher educational goals.
Scholarships were also awarded to three students from Jaffna on March 2, 2018 who achieved island wide ranks at the GCE A/L examination in 2017. They were awarded a scholarship of Rs 5,000 monthly and a laptop computer to assist them further in their studies.
In addition, in their drive to improve the facilities of the schools in the region, the Ottapulam RCTM School which was within the army controlled area was released on November 30, 2017. Further, a children’s park was constructed at the Kopay Maha Vidyalaya which was handed over to the school early last year.
A drinking water project was also initiated at the Nawatkuli Vidyalaya in July last year.

The Daham Pahana foundation has facilitated many projects to donate school items and bicycles in collaboration with the Jaffna Security Force Headquarters. Under this initiative, 300 scholarships were awarded to deserving students on May 10, 2018, and again in June this year, another 100 bicycles was donated.
Further, the ‘Palmyra Ingenuity – 2017’ innovative exhibition was organised by the Jaffna Security Force Headquarters in collaboration with the Ministry of Technology and Research in May last year.
