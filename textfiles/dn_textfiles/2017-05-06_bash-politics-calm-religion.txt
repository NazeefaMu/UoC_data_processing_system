Bash of politics to the calm of religion

The size of the May Day rallies of the main political parties remains the stuff of political discussion. The Joint Opposition (JO) certainly makes the claim of having the largest crowd, and meeting its own challenge to have a really big show at Galle Face Green. But, the comparison of crowds at May Day rallies, or at other political rallies, is certainly not the best assessment of political success. We are not too far from the time when Mahinda Rajapaksa and the UPFA led by him had truly big political rallies at the Presidential Election campaign in December 2014 to January 2015. Yet, the result was the defeat of the Rajapaksa Presidency. The history of SLFP politics is also shows that huge rallies have paved the way to defeat, rather than the much promised victory.
What stands out in the huge crowd at Galle Face Green and the park-filling crowd at the SLFP’s official rally at Getambe, Kandy, is the clear division of the SLFP, which raises many questions as to how this May Day crowd performance should be properly assessed. The size of the crowd at Galle Face has already made the formal leader of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Prof. G. L. Peiris, to state that JO members will not seek SLFP nominations for elections again, but would contest from the SLPP. What does this mean for SLFP unity, which remains a strong underlying demand among the divided leadership of the SLFP?
Getambe rally
The Galle Face rally and its impact on SLFP politics in the coming weeks and months will certainly have considerable influence on the question of discipline within the SLFP. There are reports the party will take disciplinary action against the members who ignored the invitation to attend the Getambe rally, which was the official SLFP event, and preferred to be present at Galle Face. How deep can these promised disciplinary actions go? What could be done beyond the replacement of party organisers from various electorates? What disciplinary action can or would be taken against the MPs of the SLFP in the JO, who decided to ignore the invitation to Getambe, and thought it better to show up at Galle Face Green? The major question is what disciplinary action is contemplated, or is possible, against the Mahinda Rajapaksa, who gave the leadership to the Galle Face event, and sees it as one more event that paves the way for his promise to defeat the Government very soon – or at least within the next two Vesak Full Moons?
President Maithripala Sirisena has cause for satisfaction about May Day, with his success in having the second successful May Day rally of the SLFP in a provincial city – in Kandy this year, after Galle last year. The crowd at Getambe, under rainy conditions too, was certainly good, and showed that the section of the SLFP that accepts his leadership has a good following, in many parts of the country, both urban and rural. The crowd there was a clear demonstration that Mahinda Rajapaksa does not remain the unquestioned leader of the SLFP, or UPFA anymore, whatever his talk of coming government changes. Yet, there is no question that the success of the rallies at Getambe and Galle Face shows a disturbing division of major proportions within the SLFP, and calls for early political action to restore unity within the party, if it to make progress in developments of the coming months, as a major political party in the country. The big issue ahead is the Local Government elections, which the Government has said will take place this year. The JO is already making loud statements that the Galle Face show is the way to its success in these polls. What is now considered the Maithripala Sirisena or MS wing of the SLFP will certainly have to take action, whether disciplinary or otherwise, to restore proper unity within the party and be capable of facing the voters with strength in the promised LG polls.
The Campbell Park message
The UNP’s May Day rally at Campbell Park in Colombo effectively showed the party’s strength, without the divisions that were shown the rival events at Getambe and Galle Face. The greens brought their people in large numbers to make a good show in a city that also had the JO’s Galle Face rally and the JVPs rally at the BRC, as well as several other small May Day events. As May Day is now a political event, and not anymore a day of the working people in this country, the Campbell Park rally certainly gave an important political message – that of the success of unity in politics.
Although cartoons and some political commentators see the JO’s Galle Face crowd as a failure or defeat of Ranil Wickremesinghe, in giving the Galle Face Green to the JO, with the challenge to possibly fill the Green. The reality is certainly not that simple. What the UNP showed at Campbell Park is a crowd that was overflowing the venue, without any political division. It was a major contrast to the SLFP-UPFA events at Getambe and Galle Face Green. The unity seen at Campbell Park, where the UNP did present some of its own policies on economics and development to the public was a clear show of strength as a single undivided party in politics today. It showed the essential weakness of large, but divided crowds, in the context of electoral politics, and certainly gave the impression that it must make a stronger call for the Local Government polls to be held soon.
The unity of the UNP as shown at Campbell Park gives a push for the efforts by President Sirisena to reduce the divisions that exist within the government of “National Unity”, with several SLFP members, particularly ministers, being critical of the UNP, and even calling for a breakaway from the party that was most supportive of the Common Candidate – Maithripala Sirisena - in the January 08 Presidential Election; certainly much more than most SLFP members who hold Cabinet rank today. The talks to iron out the differences that exist between the SLFP and UNP are expected to start soon, with President Sirisena showing the necessity for continued unity, especially in the context of the JO’s moves to break whatever unity that exists within the UNP-SLFP coalition that forms then Government of “National Unity”.
The calm of religion
After the joys of the National New Year shattered by the Meethotamulla disaster, and the displays of political rivalries on May Day, the country moves on to a period of religious calm, with the forthcoming Vesak Full Moon celebrations., which will be the first time that the United Nations Vesak Day will be celebrated in Sri Lanka.
The celebrations will see leaders from countries around the world with strong associations with Buddhism. The prominent among them will be Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Nepali President Bidya Devi Bandan, the countries that saw the birth of the Prince Siddhartha Gautama, the Buddha, and the initial spread of his teachings of Buddhism; and remain closely associated with Sri Lanka on aspects of its modern development of Buddhism.
Sri Lankans will be able to send a good message to the world on the presence and importance of Buddhism in the culture and lives of the people here, through the Vesak celebrations, which have always been marked for the demonstrations of the values of sharing and charity, as well as the celebration of the Light of the Dhamma or Buddhist teaching, as seen in the Vesak decorations from the simple to the large pandals and other decorations.
There were signs of attempts to raise some political storms during the Vesak season with the presence of a large number of foreign dignitaries in the country. Not surprisingly Wimal Weerawansa did call for the flying of black flags to protest at the presence of the Indian Prime Minister Modi in the country. His call has not any public response, and has even been rejected by many of his own political associates.
President Sirisena has made it very clear that the UN Vesak celebrations will be confined to religion and culture of the county, with no agreements to be signed with any country, and will be a period of necessary calm amidst the joy at celebrating the Birth, Enlightenment and Passing Away of the Buddha, as has been the strong tradition in Sri Lanka.
This is certainly a calm that is very much needed in the country, and there will be expectation that such calm, may help in the government and the country face up to many problems that are lined up ahead, which includes the major issue of corruption, and the advancing situation of trade union action that has a very strong political association, built up on considerable areas of weakness of the government- especially the cost of living and other hardships faced by the people.
