Democracy deficit stands exposed

Machinery wears out with time and over-use losing their value and utility. Besides, advance of technology makes them redundant even before they wear out necessitating their replacement with advanced machinery. A similar thing happens in the realm of conceptions too. For example, truth is also replaced by better truth, after or even before it wears out. Thus Newtonian truth was replaced by Einstein’s truth, flat earth by spherical Earth etc. This confirms the philosopher’s view that truth is always relative with each relative truth containing a germ of absolute truth.
We were pushed into this philosophical introspection on hearing the repeated pronouncement of yahapalana politicians and their sycophants that democracy was consummated on January 8, 2015. No doubt, it was a historic victory and a forward step of great significance for it marked a transition from despotic family rule to a civilized government. Yet democracy cannot be stagnant and it has to march forward incessantly.
History testifies to the fact that democracy has developed in width and depth since the time of ancient Greek civilization. It nevertheless does not minimize the significance of ancient Greek democracy. Hence pronouncements that there is already too much democracy in the country are false. They are also dangerous for if there is too much it has to be curtailed.
Counter Terrorism Bill
We would like to look at certain developments that point to a democracy deficit under the yahapalanaya. Take for example the proposed Counter Terrorism Bill. It retains some obnoxious clauses that were in the Prevention of Terrorism Act such as the admissibility of confessions before a police officer as evidence. The major defect is that such legislation is not made available for public consultation before being adopted by Parliament. The same is true of many other bills which show certain contempt for or mistrust of public opinion. This smacks of bureaucratic insolence, to say the least.
It has been the practice of governments to appoint Commissions of Inquiry whenever an issue springs up as a means of dowsing public agitation. The recommendations of such commissions are rarely implemented. The fate of the LLRC and Paranagama Commissions despite pre-election pledges is an example. Some are not even made public.
Even some minor steps that could have been taken to bestow transitional justice to the victims of the fratricidal war that ravaged in the country for 30 years have not been taken. For example, not even a list of the disappeared has been made public despite agitation by concerned family members of the disappeared. The tragedy is many of the disappeared were children handed over to the security forces after the conclusion of the war.
Two and half years after the January 8th victory, many promises such as the appointment of a Truth Commission and the opening of an Office of Missing persons remain on paper.
In bringing legislation the Government has failed to consult relevant trade unions and other stakeholders, as for example in the case of the proposed Inland Revenue Bill. Definitely this is a democracy deficit that has the potential of leading to industrial action by the working people with serious consequences.
Civil society organisations
Much worse is the rejection of public demands without any justifiable grounds to suit vested interests. The attitude of the government, especially of the Minister in charge, with regard to the 65,000 housing unit project in the North is a case in point. The people request brick and mortar houses but the Minister insists on building pre-fabricated houses. The project is to be given to Arcelor Mittal of India. The District Coordinating Committees of Jaffna and Kilinochchi, elected MPs of the area and civil society organisations have unanimously rejected the Mittal project. Residents allege that it is not suitable on environmental grounds and its cost is twice as high as building brick and mortar houses. For example, a similar housing unit built by the National Housing Development Authority costs Rs. 800,000 while that of a pre-fabricated unit built by Mittal would cost RS. 1.8 million. Also, such brick and mortar houses could be built using local labor. Besides a Cabinet sub-committee has called for fresh tenders for the project. Even that advice has been not heeded. Why such obstinacy is a moot point.
Attempts to incite the public against trade unions and other sections of the population in defense of their rights and demands also poses a question mark over the direction the Government is heading for – whether it is an unfriendly direction. Excessive use of the so-called “minimum force” by law enforcement authorities against demonstrators is also becoming more regular.
People’s mandate
Most local government bodies stand dissolved for over two years. Government has shown no urgency in completing necessary legislative and administrative measures necessary to have elections to these bodies expeditiously. This gives rise to a suspicion whether the government is willfully delaying elections in order to gain time to put their own house in order.
In today’s world democracy has progressed far. It is much more than just representative democracy. It has been our practice elected representatives no longer can be trusted to faithfully carry out the people’s mandate. Once elected, they become masters instead of servants of the public.
People should have a greater say in public affairs. Ways and means of achieving their participation Constitution Assembly should undertake with popular consultation. An extension of the hard-won democracy on January 8th could be achieved only in advancing towards a form of participatory democracy.
Corruption, fraud etc. are not compatible with genuine democracy. The failure of the Government in fighting these vices is also a democracy deficit with wide repercussions. The principal cause for this deficit is the inter-party and intra-party differences in the Government and the actions of the Joint Opposition. The inter-play of all these factions and groups caused by power politics is a principal reason also for the failures of the Government, including the abandonment of the 100-day programme.
