CALiper app to strengthen online bond trading

Sri Lanka’s first online trading app, CALliper, launched by Capital Alliance Ltd (CAL) will take government securities trading to the future and make it more accessible.
It was revealed that the CALiper digital app could facilitate online bond trading with just the click of a button.
According to CAL, the app offers an easy streamlined trading process which enables investors to manage their own portfolios.
At the launch ceremony, CAL Managing Director Gihan Hemachandra said that the app’s dash in, dash board and dash out propositions make it a hassle-free and convenient wealth enhancement tool to revolutionize the bond trading arena and empowers investors to trade and grow their wealth on their own terms.
He said CALiper will help anybody to see not only prices but also to enable trading online like buying shares on the computer.
Hemachandra further said the objective of launching CALiper is to make the Sri Lankan bond market more transparent where everyone will have access to information.
“Anybody could expect many benefits from CALiper as it trades Sri Lankan government bonds from any place in the world with a device such as Microsoft, IOS or Android which has access to the internet.
“We also create a retail client base where Sri Lankan government bond market can be reached out to every day investors.”
He said CALiper enables faster response times and up-to-date access to a personal portfolio and provides all the tools needed to measure, trade, monitor and observe government securities.
According to CAL, CALiper was developed by Finnovation and the app also won a bronze award in the Financial Industry Application category at the prestigious National Best Quality Awards.
Speaking further, Hemachandra said there is an immense need for transparency in the bond market and CALiper will help to deliver that along with greater accessibility to investors.
He said unlike the stock market, the bond market is structured as a wholesale market.
Finnovation Head of Software Uthpala Dissanayaka said CALiper has been developed to offer traders and investors of all experience levels the opportunity to make money on their own terms.
She said CALiper is available through website www.caliper.lk and thereafter it will be rolled out across other devices.
CAL Group CEO Ajith Fernando said last year CAL also launched several other digital tools and applications including Sri Lanka’s first-ever digital account registration at the Colombo Stock Exchange, the CAL Connect and the CAL Oracle Sales Cloud.
