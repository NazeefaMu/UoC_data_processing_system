Premnath Moraes
Versatile man, gentle dad
Film, music, journalistic and sports personality Premnath Moraes would have celebrated his 95th birth anniversary on January 31. We reproduce an article from the 150th year commemorative publication of St. Benedict College.
Singer, songwriter, lyricist.
Actor, film director, scriptwriter, producer.
Weightlifter, wrestler, footballer, cricketer, athlete, gymnast
journalist, sports editor, creative head and copywriter.
Commentator and silver-tongued orator,
Believe me, the list goes on.
Renaissance man? Bohemian artist? Yes to both, but to me, most importantly, the gentlest human being one could hope to meet, and the most loving father my sister Rehani or I could ever have hoped to have. Premnath Joseph Moraes – born Joseph Peter Moraes Fernando on January 31, 1923, was of solid middle class stock, who carried his simple and devout Catholic faith right through life.
In many ways he epitomized the essence of the very best of the Benedictine trademark, with traits and talents that wove a rich tapestry of arts, sports, humanity, simplicity and a Christianity that was lived rather than preached. Joining the Police force soon after school, he was seconded to the CID and later advised to leave by a senior Police Officer after having spoken openly at the funeral of a colleague who had been gunned down when leading an unarmed raid on a den of vice.
Thereafter he secured a position as a reporter with the Times of Ceylon after an interview with its Editor, Frank Moraes (father of the poet Dom), who reminded him that “the coincidence of our surnames will remain just that!”
Leaving the Times of Ceylon building, Premnath was almost knocked down by a vehicle driven by his friend Sangare Sellamuttu (later Mayor of Colombo) with whom he then got chatting and informed him of the job he had just landed. “What nonsense,” said Sellamuttu. “With your looks you should be in films. Let me introduce you to Sir Chittampalam Gardiner.”Sir Chittampalam (also an old Ben) was too busy to see my father that day and instead told him “meet me in Madras on Monday morning” (this was Friday) leaving the young applicant to fend for his fare – perhaps a test of mettle.
Young Premnath (a name he then assumed) was signed on as an actor and thus started a romance with the film industry which lasted over 50 years (from 1947 to 1998, from starring in “Kadawanu Poronduwa” (also known as 'Broken Promise') the second Sinhala film to be produced, to 'Demodara Palama', circa 1997. 'Warada Kageda' and 'Kapati Arakshakaya' in the late '40s were followed by several others. This was followed by a stint at Shanthiniketan, the centre of arts north of Calcutta. On his return to Ceylon, Premnath took up singing, was contracted to the HMV label (His Masters Voice), recorded solo as well as with Latha (Walpola) and Chitra (Somapala). Of the many recordings, perhaps the most famed are 'Sri Lanka Rani Meniye' (the de facto Catholic anthem of Sri Lanka) and 'Lak Deepe'.
On to 1953. Production Assistant (titles were not grandiose in those days) and second unit director for 'Elephant Walk', directed by William De Telle, son-in-law of the legendary Cecil B. De Mille.
Two short stints as second unit director for United Artists' 'Captain’s Table' and 'Purple Plains' which starred Gregory Peck, on to India where he was Production Manager at Gemini Studios in Madras, where most of the Sinhala Films at the time were edited, dubbed and produced.
Wide, varied and versatile though was my father’s exposure to the celluloid world, in my opinion his single-most significant contribution to the Sinhala cinema was his unremitting efforts to get Gamini Fonseka into it, culminating in a successful introduction to Lester James Peiris, who brought Gamini into 'Rekawa' in a non-starring role. The rest – to use a cliché – is history!
Now onto that integral part of Premnath’s being that merited his inclusion in this journal, Premnath Moraes the Benedictine. He was very active in both sports and the arts, representing St. Benedict’s at cricket, soccer and athletics. Involved in film and music and living in Kotahena, there came to be formed at my father’s home, a sports club, circa 1948 – euphemistically referred to as the MCC. This humble grouping of kindred and sporting spirits at the ‘MCC’ was the beginnings and foundation of the Old Bens Sports Club which was formally inaugurated in 1958.
My Father was the first Gen. Secretary of the Old Bens Sports. Premnath worked tirelessly to support and build the fledgling club and is credited with the initiation of the still vibrant Quadrangular Cricket Tournament. History has been kind to him in that his love for the school and his commitment and contribution towards it are still remembered. Journalism next and the ‘nom de plume’ SEAROM (MORAES in reverse), is still remembered. His turn of phrase was fluent, lyrical and polished, and the rapier wit and thrust invariably found its mark in his - relished by many, dreaded by some column - Petals and Pellets.
What about Premnath the man? Impish in humour, gullible, ever willing to help, and never holding a grudge or remembering an injustice. I am a rare animal – a fourth generation Benedictine, yet in College and all College-related for a, I have no individual identity, I am still simply referred to as ‘Premnath’s son’ and for that I am ever so proud!
