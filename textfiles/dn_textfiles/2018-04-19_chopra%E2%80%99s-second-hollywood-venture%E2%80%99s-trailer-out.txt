Chopra’s second Hollywood venture’s trailer is out

Priyanka Chopra’s second Hollywood outing ‘A Kid Like Jake’ has been grabbing headlines since its inception. From earning recognition in international film festivals to the moving plotline, ‘A Kid Like Jake’ seems to be on everyone’s watch list this year. After a prolonged wait, the movie’s trailer is finally out and it will get you all choked up.
The beautiful trailer narrates the story of parents who are trying to get their kid Jake admitted into a kindergarten. But their little boy is somehow interested in fairy tales and princesses than trucks and ninja turtles. This obviously confuses his parents and they aren’t sure how to deal with Jake’s preferences. In order to devoid Jake of any sort of an embarrassment at his school, they are thinking of other options to make his life better. While Priyanka has a blink-and-miss appearance in the trailer, we do see her getting introduced as one of the significant characters which puts her under the limelight.
