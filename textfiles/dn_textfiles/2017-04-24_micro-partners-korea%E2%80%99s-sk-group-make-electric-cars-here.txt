Micro partners Korea’s SK Group to make electric cars here

Micro Car Holdings has tied up with South Korea’s top three largest diversified conglomerates, SK Group to make Sri Lanka’s first electric car.
SK Group, a Fortune 500 company will invest US$ 30 million this year and a further US$ 20 million in the next two years with Micro to manufacture this car in Sri Lanka.
SK Group Senior Vice President C.H. Lee said this is the first time that they are investing in the South Asian region. “We have seen the rapid technological progress of Micro Cars in Sri Lanka and decided to invest with them.”

Micro ventured into the overseas market by exporting vehicles into Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal in 2011. In 2012 Micro opened Sri Lanka’s largest After Sales Centre to cater the demand of the ever expanding market share. “We will also export this car from mid 2018.”
He said Micro’s future expansions will receive significant financing from SK and they will increase their production facility.
