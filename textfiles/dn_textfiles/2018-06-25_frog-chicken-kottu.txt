Frog in Chicken Kottu

A family in Ambalantota was in for a rude shock when they found out that the ‘Chicken Kottu’ they bought for dinner had a large frog instead of chicken.
The woman who bought the Kottu’had immediately gone to the Public Health Inspector’s office in the area with the food she bought and had lodged a complaint.
The PHI Malaka Silva yesterday confirmed that the Kottu he had taken from the woman had parts of a frog.
Silva said he had visited the food outlet and had recorded a statement from its owner. The eatery owner is to be produced before the Hambantota Magistrate’s courts.
