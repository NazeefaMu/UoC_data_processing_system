Unilever and Sathosa launch Season 2 of Idam Nidanaya mega land giveaway

Unilever Sri Lanka together with the nation’s largest state-owned retail network, Lanka Sathosa, unveiled the second phase of the ‘Idam Nidanaya’ mega land giveaway promotion at Water’s Edge, Battaramulla, recently.
Dr. T.M.K.B. Tennakoon, Chairman, Lanka Sathosa, Aruna Mawilmada, Customer Development Director, Unilever Sri Lanka and over 450 invitees including several senior managers and all outlets managers from Lanka Sathosa and senior executives from Unilever Sri Lanka were present at this event.
The ‘Idam Nidanaya’ promo was introduced in 2016 as part of a joint effort by Sathosa and Unilever to thank consumers for shopping at the retail chain and reward them for their loyalty.
This year, they will be giving away three prime plots of land and other prizes worth Rs.1 million to shoppers purchasing any three nominated brands during the months of October and November. Given the overwhelmingly positive response to the campaign in 2016, the second phase of the promo is set to be a shot in the arm to the retailer’s plans to expand its base to 500 outlets.
“Having reached our 380th branch mark earlier this year, we continue to expand the Lanka Sathosa network to serve all Sri Lankans around the island. Consumer promotions such as the widely popular Idam Nidanaya promo that we had developed together with Unilever Sri Lanka in 2016 play a significant role in helping us realize this goal. With valuable plots of land and several other prizes on offer, it had helped us win over the hearts and minds of consumers around the island last year. Encouraged by their response, we are delighted to partner with Unilever Sri Lanka and reward our patrons yet again through this promo,” said Dr Tennakoon.
“We are honored to partner with Lanka Sathosa, the nation’s largest state-owned retail network, on the Idam Nidanaya campaign for the second consecutive year. In line with our core ideals of ‘Doing Well by Doing Good’, we seek to reward consumers for placing their trust in our brands. Given the widely positive response we had received in 2016, we look forward to seeing greater consumer participation this year,” said Aruna Mawilmada, Customer Development Director, Unilever Sri Lanka.
