Ton-up Stokes punishes South Africa in 3rd Test

LONDON July 28: Ben Stokes’s century against a depleted South Africa attack left England in a commanding position at tea on Friday’s second day of the third Test at The Oval.
South Africa were 18 for one in reply to England’s first innings 353, a deficit of 335 runs.
Dean Elgar (eight) was out to what became the last ball before the interval when he was caught behind off Toby Roland-Jones to give the Middlesex seamer, one of three debutant in England’s XI, his first Test wicket.
Earlier, Stokes made 112 against a South Africa attack missing the ill Vernon Philander.
The seamer only bowled five overs Friday before being taken to hospital for tests on what appeared to be a worsening stomach complaint. Philander had enjoyed a superb return of two for 17 in 12 overs on Thursday’s rain-marred first day and, if fully fit, would surely have relished the continued overcast conditions in what is the 100th Test staged at The Oval.
England had been criticised by several former captains for some slap-dash batting in a huge 340-run defeat by in the second Test at Trent Bridge that saw the Proteas level this four-match series at 1-1. But Stokes got the balance right on Friday by being aggressive against the old ball and watchful when the new one arrived before upping the tempo late on. England resumed on 171 for four, with Alastair Cook 82 not out and Stokes 21 not out.
