Over 100 players from the southern coastal towns at Kalutara, Ambalangoda and Galle will take part in this tournament which would help to foster friendship and understanding between the Tamil, Muslim and Sinhalese communities which is the aim of the AGSEP.
The chief Co-ordinator of the tournament is Kevin Cordshagen of the AGSEP. The German Ambassador in Sri Lanka Jorn Rohde has been invited as the chief guest for the tournament.
The tournament will give the paddlers from the Northern Province the much needed exposure and help to unearth hidden talent in the province.
