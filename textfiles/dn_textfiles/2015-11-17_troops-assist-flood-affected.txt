Meanwhile, responding to an SoS by irrigation engineer Anura Konegedara, who is in charge of the Maha Horiwila Tank in Kalaththewa, Anuradhapura on Saturday evening, 51 soldiers under training at the Non-Commissioned Officers Training School in Kalaththewa rushed to the Maha Horiwila tank spill gates area under threat from spilling water levels and averted an imminent disaster by using sandbags, etc. Farmers and villagers alerted Irrigation Department authorities of a possible breaching of the tank bund due to torrential rains on Saturday evening.
Konegedara appealed for help from the Commandant at this Army School who immediately sent the troops.
