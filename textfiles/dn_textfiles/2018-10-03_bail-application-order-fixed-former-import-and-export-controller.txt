Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake yesterday, fixed the order of the bail application of Former Import and Export Controller Mahagamage Gamini, who was arrested for allegedly demanding a bribe of Rs. 200,000 from a businessman.
Officers of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) told the Magistrate that investigations have not yet been completed. Gamini had allegedly solicited a bribe of Rs. 200,000 from a businessman in Weligama to provide a report containing recommendations necessary to import two vehicles from Japan, which are around 10 years old, through legal channels.
Earlier, the Attorney-at-Law appearing on behalf of the suspect pleaded that his client be granted bail due to the serious health condition of his wife and daughter.
However, the Attorney-at-Law appearing on behalf of the suspect submitted a medical report of the daughter before the court.
The Magistrate stated that he would deliver the bail order after considering the medical report on October 9.
