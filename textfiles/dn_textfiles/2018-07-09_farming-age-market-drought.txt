Farming in the age of market drought

Selling farm products is an inherent problem due to the seasonality of production as a result of the biological nature of production. Farming takes place based on the monsoons. As this problem is common to both developed and developing countries, every country has specific policies to mitigate this problem. Price policy is a common to develop and developing countries but the nature of implementation varies by countries. In the United States, the operating system is called deficiency payments in which farmers are requested to keep the stocks at harvest time till price increases and deficiency payments are made by the government if prices fall below the target price which was determined by the government after taking the cost and desired profit into account. In countries like the Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand farmers are encouraged to keep stocks rather than selling the entire harvests at harvest time by providing marketing loans to meet the immediate cash requirements. In China, there are two procurement prices; one for the season and another for the off-season. The purpose of dual pricing policy is providing an assured market for off-season whereby encouraging farmers to hold stocks rather than selling entire stocks at harvest time. Commonly, these measures are known as supply management strategy. In the past, the main supply management strategy was procurement by the government at the predetermined price at harvest time. By now, this strategy has become a least important due to inefficiency in operation and high cost to the treasury. Many countries are now moving to other supply chain management policies such as the promotion of farm storage and market-led production plan whereby the government has become the last buyer instead of the main buyer.
Current problem of selling vegetables
A severe problem of selling pumpkins and tomatoes has been reported in the recent times. According to the observations, farmers cultivated more pumpkins and tomatoes in abandon paddy fields due to the inability to grow paddy resulting from the shortage of water. The root cause of the problem is excess supply. As a vegetable, these two commodities are not popular among the Sri Lankan consumers, unlike beans and carrots which are never being thrown away so far in the country. Hence, demand for pumpkin and tomatoes are not increased considerably even the price drop which results in a sharp decline of prices. To protect the farmers, the government should make arrangements with either government agencies or private entities to purchase and sell to the big institutional consumers such as prisons, hospitals and zoos. India is practising this strategy when there is unexpected excess supply. Even for these short-term arrangements to implement, the excess supply should be estimated in advance. Despite the well established institutional mechanism, the problem is unaware of excess supply until the media highlight it.
There is a system to monitor the crop situation at divisional, district and national levels. At the divisional level, the agricultural committee chaired by the Divisional secretary monitors the crop condition. At the village level, Agricultural Research and Production Assistants (ARPs) can monitor crop situation and report to the committee through the Development Officer at the Agrarian Service Centre (ASC). According to the designations, crop monitoring should be a mandatory function for them. At the district level, there is a committee chaired by the District Secretary to monitor crop situation while at national level Ministry of Agriculture is responsible to monitor crop condition. Accordingly, it is clear that there is a well-established system to monitor crop situation and estimate excess supply well in advance. The reality shows the inefficiency of the system.
Solutions to the problem
Many people suggest cold storage and food processing as solutions to excess supply in the short term despite the fact that past experience shows the failure of these solutions. Under the Mahaweli project (MARD) a cold storage was set up at Piburattawa in the System B of the Mahaweli project area with the capacity of two metric tons to store vegetables but it was a failure due to lack of vegetables to store. It was also found that storing vegetables was not economically profitable because the price of stored vegetables was higher than fresh vegetable harvested on the field at the time of releasing stored vegetables on the market. Those who recommend cold storage should understand the cost of storage that adds to the final price and availability of vegetables adequately to function the stores. If the non-stored vegetables are cheaper than the stored vegetables there will be a problem in the marketing of stored vegetable profitability. The failure example was the establishment of a tomato processing factory in Matale which had to be closed down due to an inadequate supply of tomatoes.
In addition to the short-term solution, the long-term solution is production planning based on the market requirements. That will give the permanent solution to the problem. The need for the market-led production system to solve the marketing problem of vegetables has been identified a long time ago. In 1995 the Cabinet appointed the subcommittee to study marketing problems of vegetables and suggest solutions to the problem.
The present secretary to the President was also a member of the committee and he was the secretary of the cooperative ministry at that time. The writer was also a member of the committee. The committee examined the problem critically and recommended a series of recommendations to solve the marketing problem of vegetables. One recommendation was the implementation of the market-based production system. Since it was not materialized the same recommendation was repeated in almost all policy documents until today. I have seen in the newspapers the same recommendation was made to the current problem of vegetable marketing.
In this country, functional plans are lacking and hence many recommendations limit to the paper. Having identified this problem the writer when he was at Hector Kobbekaduwa Agrarian Research at Training Institute (HARTI) initiated to formulate a functional plan towards the market led production system for vegetables in 2012 in collaboration with Ministry of Agriculture and the Department of Agriculture.
Initially, the country requirements of vegetables by varieties were estimated based on the information available in the Household Income Expenditure Survey (HIES). In that survey, per capita monthly vegetable consumption is available by varieties and the country requirement was estimated per capita consumption multiplying population. The second step was to estimate the extent required for each vegetable that was calculated based on the estimated production dividing average yield of the variety concern. Having identified the monthly requirement of extent under each vegetable, the third step was the identification of locations and allocation of extent for each identified location. For this exercise, the two-day residential workshop was organised at HARTI with the district and divisional agricultural officers of Central and Provincial Ministries of agriculture. The final outcome was the preparation of the market led vegetable production plan and it was submitted to the Ministry of Agriculture for implementation. Since it was not implemented, the problem remains as it is and the need of market-led vegetable production system is being talked about continuously.
The question is why the functional plan was not implemented. The answer can be found in the management science. In management, responsibility, authority and accountability are three main concepts that determine the performance. Responsibility is a commitment to undertake assigned duties. Authority is right to give orders to get the work done. Accountability is answerable to the higher authority regarding the work done. These three principles are functioning smoothly in the private sector and hence performance is good while in the state sector these concepts are not taken seriously. In case of the vegetable problem of farmers, no one is answerable or accountable, hence the problem is not taken seriously.
Another issue related to the lack of accountability is doing and repeating mistakes without any fear. The HARTI suggested not to be established the Economic Centre at Weeawilla due to inability to compete with the existing pola system. But it was constructed and failed. The same mistakes repeated in Wariyapola that was also failed. There are many examples of failure cases such as the construction of “Govisevana”, the introduction of plastic crates and setting up public markets.
The public can see how many government buildings ruined even without an opening. According to the management, pre-feasibility and feasibility studies should be undertaken to examine the validity before starting it. In Sri Lanka, this practice is not happening in many instances. The reason is lack of answerability for the work.
Although the agricultural sector is the main driver of poverty alleviation and food security the sector performance is unsatisfactory as evident by the high incidence of rural poverty and increasing food imports. The sector cannot be developed until the agricultural management is improved. As Peter Drcker, father of modern management pointed out management is doing things right and leadership is doing the right things. With regard to marketing, the right thing is a selection of crops based on the market demand. Higher the demand means higher the production and vice versa and the doing things right means producing product at lower cost and following agrochemical practices acceptable to the community.
The products that were unable to sell were pumpkin and tomatoes. They have lower demand and become difficult to sell when vegetables like beans, carrot and potatoes are available in the market at a cheaper price. During the period of March to May, vegetables are cheap due to the arrival of Maha season crops. For instance, farmers in Matale and Dambulla areas cultivate vegetables after harvesting of big onions in September and October and harvesting commences from January onwards.
In this context, cultivation of pumpkin and tomatoes on abandoned paddy lands is not the right thing. Pumpkin should have been stored for some time as prices of vegetables are on the increase since the end of May to end of July of the year until the vegetable supply arrives in the market from Marassana and Rekillagaskada areas known as “Kandy vegetable season”.
