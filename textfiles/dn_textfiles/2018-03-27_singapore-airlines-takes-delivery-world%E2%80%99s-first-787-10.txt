Singapore Airlines takes delivery of world’s first 787-10

Singapore Airlines (SIA) has taken delivery of its first Boeing 787-10 from the manufacturer’s production facility in North Charleston, South Carolina. SIA is the world’s first airline to take delivery of Boeing’s newest aircraft variant, which is due to enter commercial service next month.
The aircraft – the first of 49 787-10s that SIA has on firm order - was formally delivered at a ceremony today in North Charleston (evening of 25 March 2018 local time) attended by SIA CEO Goh Choon Phong. Also in attendance were Boeing Commercial Airplanes President and CEO Kevin McAllister, Rolls-Royce Director Customers and Services – Civil Aerospace Dominic Horwood, some three thousand Boeing employees as well as invited guests.
“It is an honour for us to be the world’s first airline to take delivery of this amazing aircraft. The 787-10 is indeed a magnificent piece of engineering and truly a work of art. It will be an important element in our overall growth strategy, enabling us to expand our network and strengthen our operations,” said Goh at the delivery event.
“The delivery of the first 787-10 underscores our longstanding commitment to operate a modern fleet, and marks the start of a new chapter in our shared story with Boeing.”
SIA’s 787-10s will be used for flights up to eight hours. Osaka and Perth will be the first scheduled destinations to be served by the new aircraft, from May 2018.
