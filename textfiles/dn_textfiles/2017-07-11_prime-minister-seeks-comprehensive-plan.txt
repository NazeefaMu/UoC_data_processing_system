Prime Minister seeks comprehensive plan

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Saturday sought a comprehensive plan for the long term conservation of Maha Viharaya premises in the Anuradhapura Sacred Area.
He said that he has already sought a long term plan from the Education Minister to carry out conservation activities.
“I have directed the Education Minister to appoint a committee comprising the Central Cultural Fund, Archaeological Department and university academia specialised in archaeology for the formulation a long term plan,”the Prime Minister said. He added that the government can allocate funds each year for excavation activities based on this plan. “I have instructed the Education Minister to start discussions with Thailand and Myanmar authorities to have a Theravada Buddhist Triangle with the Sacred City of Anuradhapura,”he said.
Wickremesinghe added that the Ministers should get actively involved in this process.
The Prime Minister was speaking after attending religious activities at the Sacred Ruwanweli Maha Seya premises on Saturday.
He added that the Maha Viharaya suffered more damage not at the hands of Cholas but heretics.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said that Buddhists have failed in conserving their heritage though they are proudly talking of their religion.
He said that there are more Buddhists in the world than Jews but Jews have succeeded in protecting and preserving the Wailing Wall with is sacred to them.
“Sikhs are lesser in numbers than Buddhists but they preserve their Golden Temple. The Muslims protect and preserve the Maouselum of Prophet Muhammad. What have we done to protect our Buddhist Centres,”he queried.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe added that the government is on the verge of completing conservation work on a part of the Ruwanweli Seya Dagoba.
Premier Wickremesinghe added that he will make a new proposal that will make affairs of the Buddhist Nikayas free of any government interference once the interim report of the new Constitution is tabled before the Constitutional Council.
“If not,” the Prime Minister said, “whenever a government that does not accept traditions should come into power, Buddhism may be in danger.”
Premier Wickremesinghe said that he expects the Mahasangha’s support in his endeavor to move the proposal for the protection of Buddhism.
