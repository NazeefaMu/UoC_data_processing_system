SL tea auctions  in China

The cabinet has granted permission to hold Sri Lanka tea auctions in China. This is subsequent to a proposal made by Minister of Plantations Industries Navin Dissanayake.
Sri Lanka will now look at entering into new agreements with China to hold tea auctions and also to hold more promotions in China to push its black tea sales.
According to Sri Lanka Tea Board, there is a steady demand for Sri Lanka back tea in China. Sri Lanka exported one million kilos of tea to China in 2010 and this increased to 8 million kilos in 2016. Sri Lanka’s share of China’s tea imports had grown to 38% by end of 2016, up from 26% in 2015.
Currently Sri Lanka is a top exporter of black tea while both Vietnam and India are behind Sri Lanka.
