Katina festival as celebrated in Thailand

The month beginning on the full-moon day of Vap and ending on the full-moon day of Il – is traditionally known as the cheevaramaasa, (month of robes). This is the period in which new robes are offered to the Sanghaand this ancient ceremonial offering is called the Katina puja. The Katina ceremony is the culmination of the Vas season and it is a great occasion in the religious life of Sinhala Buddhists.
This practice continues at the same period of the year, in countries to which Buddhism has spread, although it may not be a season of rain in some of those countries. The Katina ceremonies have continued through the ages and have evolved from culture to culture. The traditions of Theravada Buddhism spread throughout Southeast Asia as Buddhism won the favour of ruling monarchs in Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand.
Sukhothai Inscriptions
Let us take, for example, Thailand. Buddhism was introduced to Thailand by King Asoka in during the 3rd century B.C. It was the same time Buddhism was introduced to Sri Lanka. Just like Sri Lanka, Buddhism established itself in Thailand and developed very rapidly. However, three centuries later, Mahayana started to became powerful in Far East countries and during the reign of King Kanishka in the second half of the first century A.D., it began to settle down in Thailand too.
Theravada Buddhism was re-established in Thailand under the patronage of KingRamkhamhaeng. He is credited with firm establishment of Theravada Buddhism as the state religion of the kingdom.He reigned between 1279–1298. Sukhothai Inscriptionsconfirm the arrival of the original Lankavongse(Sri Lanka) sect of Buddhism to Sukhothai via Nakhon Si Thammarat in the reign of King Ramkhamhaeng. That monarch selected Buddhist teachings. Later when the newly modified Lankavongse sect of Buddhism and religious beliefs from Lanna Kingdom spread to Sukhothai, the period of "faith leading wisdom" came. Theravada Buddhism that was introduced during this period in time is still a part of the current Thai culture. It has gone through some challenges, but has been able to get back on its feet each time. The Theravada Buddhism in Thailand is now known as Lankavamsa.
Kathina ceremony
Today in Thailand, the Kathina ceremony provides one of the most popular occasions for merit-making. The Buddhist people celebrate this robe- offering ceremony with profound respect and devotion to the monks, who have just spent three months in the monastery observing the Khao Pansa (Vassana).
In rural Thailand, everybody in a village will participate in the Kathina ceremony as a community activity which may last anywhere from one day to as many as three days. Thekathina ceremonies will include events that reinforce commitments to such Buddhist values as generosity, selflessness, and charity. The highlight of the kathina ceremony is the presentation of gifts and new robes to the Buddhist monks in local temples and monasteries.
The kathina ceremony is an important opportunity for villagers to gain merit. While the villagers prepare foods and material gifts for the monks, a principal donor, a wealthy person from a larger community, may provide the bulk of the support. The reason wealthy donors sponsor kathinas in the villages is that they often believe that rural monasteries may follow monastic ideals more closely than urban ones do.
A typical kathina celebration might include a procession featuring musical groups with traditional instruments such as horns, drums, and cymbals. Alternatively, school bands might play music. In some cases, dancers are part of the procession and marchers may process in traditional costumes. Traditions vary.
