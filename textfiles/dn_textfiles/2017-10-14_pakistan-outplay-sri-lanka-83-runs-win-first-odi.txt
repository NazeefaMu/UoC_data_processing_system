Pakistan outplay Sri Lanka by 83 runs to win first ODI

DUBAI, Friday – Pakistan coming out for the first time since they won the ICC Champions Trophy in England in June showed that they had lost none of their composure when they beat Sri Lanka by 83 runs to win the first One-Day International played at the Dubai International Stadium on Friday.
Pakistan fielding the same squad that won them the Champions trophy with the exception of injured fast bowler Mohammad Amir proved more than a handful for Sri Lanka who were simply brushed aside without much ado.
Sri Lanka proved no match for an all-fired up Pakistan side seeking vengeance from their 2-0 whitewash in the Test series.
After running up an impressive score of 292-6, they crippled Sri Lanka through their fast bowlers Rumman Raees and Hasan Ali who picked up two early wickets apiece to have half the side out for 67 by the 16th over and eventually 209-8.
Raees a replacement for Amir pushed Sri Lanka onto the back foot with the wickets of Dickwella (19) and Chandimal (4) before Hasan delivered the crippling blow by sending back Mendis (2) and Siriwardana (0) off successive deliveries.
In between these successes Hafeez bowling his off breaks on a teasing line and length accounted for a struggling Tharanga (18) who got caught in a tangle and was bowled.
The task for Sri Lanka was getting harder as they needed a big partnership like the Babar-Malik to get anywhere close to the Pakistan total. That was not forthcoming and Sri Lanka folded up tamely.
It was not easy batting out under lights with the Pakistani bowlers all over them with their fine lines and lengths that made run making difficult. But there was no excuse for the way the Lankan batsmen fronted up to the bowling. They could have shown more discipline in their batting.
Top scorer for Sri Lanka was Lahiru Thirimanne with a fighting 53 off 74 balls. Dananjaya and Vandersay (25) put to shame some of the top batters when they shared an eighth wicket partnership of 68 of 94 balls which was the highest for the wicket in an ODI at Dubai. Dananjaya went onto score his maiden ODI fifty off 72 balls with five fours and remain not out with Lakmal on seven.
The defeat was Sri Lanka’s eighth loss on the trot and they need to do something drastic to get out of jail as they had in the Tests. To get back to winning ways Sri Lanka first of all must have a settled batting line up not one that keeps changing from match to match and from series to series. Batsmen should know what their permanent slots are instead of being shuttled to and fro. Until that is done Sri Lanka will struggle to chase or put up totals in excess of 200 against good bowling sides.
Pakistan invited to bat first built their total around Babar Azam’s sixth one-day hundred. Following the early dismissal of Ahmed Shehzad for a duck in the fourth over Babar who came to the wicket at no. 3 anchored the innings to score a finely paced 103 off 131 balls (5 fours) before being sixth out at 269 in the 49th over.
After a slow start Pakistan gradually increasing the tempo in their batting with Azam blocking up one end and allowing his partners to free their arms at the other. This way he put together two useful stands one of 64 off 77 balls with Fakhara Zaman (43) and the other with the experienced Shoaib Malik that was the cornerstone of the innings – 139 off 114 balls the highest fourth wicket stand in Dubai.
Malik playing freely and playing a dominant role slammed 81 off 61 balls that included five fours and two sixes, the first six being the 100th of his career. Relishing Malik’s innings from the stands was his Indian wife Sania Mirza, the famous tennis star.
When the partnership was going strong Pakistan looked good enough to finish with a total in excess of 300 but Sri Lanka managed to pull back towards the latter stages picking up three wickets for six runs off eight balls once they broke the partnership through Suranga Lakmal who accounted for both Malik and Babar to finish with 2 for 47.
Despite the fall of quick wickets Pakistan still managed 89 off their last 10 overs which gave them a competitive total.
Sri Lanka did not fancy taking their chances on a re-laid pitch and after Tharanga won the toss decided to field first.
However as it turned out to be there was not much for the bowlers although it was on the slow side and Sri Lanka were left regretting why they did not bat first.
Sri Lanka showed vast improvement on the field being very slick and their bowlers bowled a disciplined line and bowled to their fields although Chandimal’s miss at mid-on off Babar at 42 may have cost them the match.
However one could not fault Sri Lanka for allowing Pakistan to score as much as they did because this was an experienced batting line up and the batsmen knew exactly when to press on the accelerator.
A lot of focus was placed on opener Fakhar Zaman, the hero of Pakistan’s Champion trophy win over India in the final with a century but after scoring 43 off 45 balls he was undone by Akila Dananjaya’s googly.
Mohammad Hafeez made 32 off 38 balls before becoming a victim of Jeffrey Vandersay.
Hafeez could not make use of a successful review when he was saved by the thinnest of edges on an lbw dismissal and was dismissed the next ball attempting a pull that ended in a catch to long on.
Babar Azam was made Man of the Match.
The second and third ODIs will take place at Abu Dhabi on October 16 and 18 before moving to Sharjah.
