“We are for a political solution if the problem is political”

Addressing a group of Sri Lankans at the London Inter Continental Hotel on July 12, 1987 Prime Minister Premadasa spoke angrily about the dropping of food parcels by air under the protection of Indian mirage jets in June 1987 at a time when the relations between the two countries were strained.
As you all know ours was a peaceful country where people of different races and religions lived in perfect harmony. They loved each other. They respected each other’s political, religious and cultural freedom.Then terrorism raised its ugly head. Terrorism, as seen all over the world, has no regard for religion or culture or human rights or for anything that is valued in civilized society. They are a bunch of plains criminals or gangsters. They kill for the love of killing. They care not whether their victims are infants, women, innocent workers or the pious clergy.
“But what is strange is that there are some who call them boys, militants, guerrillas, freedom fighters and..... ... Who is calling them by these names? Naturally they are the people who support them. Why do they support them? It is to get their support in return. What support do they except in return for supporting the terrorists? That is the big question.
“You will agree that terrorism has become a global menace. It is a threat to the democratic world and to the democratic way of life. Those of us who cherish democratic ideals should refrain from supporting, sheltering and encouraging terrorism. All the democratic nations and countries in the world should unite, close ranks and join hands to demolish and destroy terrorism whether it is national or international.
“All peace loving nations that cherish democratic ideals and those who value fundamental human rights and freedom must pool their resources to fight terrorism, the common enemy. As a first step the developed countries must curb the supply of arms to the terrorists. They must exercise vigilance on the movement of terrorist, their sources of funds and supplies. As small countries like Sir Lanka find difficult to combat terrorism without international assistance a fund should be established for that purpose.
“Sri Lanka since 1977 has been on the path of rapid social and economic development. We liberalized our economy and foreign investors came in large numbers. A wide range of industries were established. This led to an increase in our per capita income far beyond that of many developing countries. It provided employment to more and more people. We tapped the potential of the Mahaweli River and several other rivers.
“Our country began to approach self sufficiency in our staple foods. We were fast producing enough hydro electricity for industrial and domestic use. We began a most ambitious housing programme. After housing a hundred thousand families were are now fast moving towards a target of a million houses. Or people were beginning to feel secure and satisfied. We have always followed a non aligned foreign policy.
“Now there are those who are envious of all this. Our success is an irritant to them. Some of them feel that we should toe their line. They find our economic progress something to be jealous about. They see our political stability as a thorn in their flesh. Their reaction is very clear. They think Sri Lanka must be destabilised.
“On the subject of terrorism in Sri Lanka let me tell you that it is fed and nurtured in India and more particularly in the State of Tamil Nadu. All these years the Indian authorities denied it. They denied it despite revelations made in their own newspapers.
“Later they admitted the pressure brought about by the terrorist leaders taking refuge on the Indian soil. They invited them to talks at official level. They also took some of them into temporary custody along with their guns and mortars.
“Apart from all this, the terrorists themselves have declared that India is their foster mother. Living up to that relationship the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu made a cash donation of thirty million Indian Rupees to the LTTE which is the main terrorist group in Sri Lanka.
“There has never been any starvation in Sri Lanka not in its living memory. Have you ever heard of food shortages in the Jaffna area? Despite the obstacles placed by the terrorists our government has supplied food, medicine and other essentials to the people of the North and the East.
“Despite the recent embargo on fuel supplies to the Jaffna Peninsula they were given enough kerosene for their domestic use. Fuel for public transport was available freely. Under no stretch of imagination can one say that petrol, diesel and kerosene are food items. But only a prejudicial mind can say so. So my friends, we experienced the latest episode of food dropping from the air.
“That was a naked violation of Sri Lankan air space. By whom? By the Government of India. The whole world is now asking questions. How can this great culture based on Rig Veda produce power hungry policy that seeks to destroy its neighbours? Where is the non- violence of Mahatma Gandhi? Where is the vision of peace of Tagore? Where is the magnanimity of Jawaharlal Nehru? What is path for the successors of the heritage of those grat men to have chosen?
“You must have read in the world Press the most unambiguous criticisms of that high handed act by India. I will tell you exactly what happened. The Indian Government suddenly decided that the people of Jaffna were starving. They ignored for a moment that millions of people were starving in their own country. They decided to force-feed the well-fed people of Jaffna. So the Indian Government informed the Government of Sri Lanka on June 1,1987 that they will be sending a shipload of food supplies to Jaffna on June 3 and asked for the Sri Lanka Government help in the distribution. Well, we replied that we have enough food and we don't need Indian supplies. If India insists in being so generous the matter could be discussed with our officials so that the modalities could be arranged.
“When a big bully wants to force a bun down a small boy's throat, he doesn't discuss modalities with the little fellow. Similarly India sent a convoy of food barges on June 3. Our Navy stopped them from entering our waters. Of course the barges had to go back. This bully felt insulted. The very next day after informing our High Commissioner in India a mere hour in advance, the Indian Air Force escorted by Mirage 2000 fighters dropped some 22 to 23 tons of food supplies on Sri Lankan territory. This was nothing short of a brazen invasion. The whole world was shocked. Hasn't the Government of India painted a picture that they support terrorism openly?
“As you yourselves know there is no starvation in our country. People of all races are living in exemplary amity. It is only in the North and East that the Tamil terrorists are not tolerating the sober minded among their own people. Please remember that the majority of the Tamil people live not in the Jaffna peninsula but outside in the other parts of the country and among the Sinhalese. They are a prosperous lot helped and cared for by the Sinhalese and Muslims.
“Thomas A. Marks of the University of Hawaii and former US Military Intelligence Analyst have made certain observations on the Indian Government involvement. I quote: “Throughout 1986 and 1987 however, each time the military attempted concerted action against the insurgents, the Indians stepped in and pressurized Colombo to curtail its offensive. Yet it is clear that Indian involvement has made the situation for worse than it would have been, had the parties involved were allowed to deal with each others on their own terms and in relative isolation.'
“In an attempt to justify the air drops various excuses have been given by the Indian Government. It has been said that the air drop was due to Sri Lanka's flippant attitude. But the whole world knows that we have always stood for a peaceful settlement. In fact we have offered much more than any other governments would have been able to offer.
“It is said that Sri Lanka has been buying time for a military solution. But the truth is that whenever the terrorists were losing ground against the Sri Lankan armed forces India bought time for them by bringing pressure on Sri Lanka under various pretexts.
“We want peace, harmony and brotherhood to return to our country soon. We are for a political solution if the problem is political. But it is not possible to find a political solution in an atmosphere of tension. Violence and endless destruction. This is the policy that has been adopted by our Government.
“An AFP news report from New Delhi Dated July 10 has quoted Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi referring to terrorists in his own country saying that there cannot be any kind of talks until the Sikh militants stop fighting and killing people. The bloody violence would have to end first'.
“He had said this in the wake of the killing of 72 Hindus by the Sikh militants in Punjab and Haryana States in India. So you will see that there is no difference in the policy adopted by India and Sri Lanka. But the trouble is that the Indian Government is following double standards, one in respect of their terrorist problem and another in respect of ours. Anyway I hope that the Government of India would realise the truth,” concluded Premadasa.
