So, you want to start-up and develop a small business – Part 03
To succeed in your new small business, having a fantastic  idea is not enough!

As excited as you may be about a new business, it’s important to stay grounded and be realistic about it. You shouldn’t have a “Field of Dreams” mentality when starting your business.
Just because you have a vision and decide to build it does not mean the rest will follow. While you may have an idea that is original, revolutionary or ahead of its time, there should be a real, solid market opportunity to ensure it is successful. Any new business case or new endeavour has to have a viable market that you believe you can sell now – not theoretically or on the premise that there is a future for this market.
Although your business niche and the idea behind your business are important, neither makes the primary difference when it comes to the survival of your business. Rather, the primary difference maker is you! The niche and the idea are only small parts of the puzzle that is success.
Puzzle pieces
Today, let us discuss a few of the most important puzzle pieces, including the cornerstone piece (that being you), and we will explain why you need to put them all together to ensure your business’s success. Actually, you don’t need a new idea to be successful. Most small-business owners dive into their niches because they love the product or service they provide.
The history of small business is filled with stories of founders who cared so deeply about their product or service.that they subsequently decided to make it their life’s work.
Of course, the vast majority of small-business owners do not break new ground. However, they happily make a comfortable living by doing what many others before them have already done. Unfortunately, having a ground-breaking idea, extensive product knowledge, or unbridled enthusiasm has very little real influence on your long-term business success.
Even if you make the best Kavum, Kokis and Athirasa this side of Agnes Nona of Matara, your confectionary business could still crash and burn. Maybe you don’t sell enough of them, or you have a hard time meeting the demand for the ones you do sell. Maybe you sell van loads of our traditional sweets but your prices are too low to make a profit, or your customers won’t paytheir bills.
Important chores
Having a good product and knowing the product well are only the beginning of building a successful business; you must also perform a long list of sometimes arduous day-to-day chores to be a successful small-business owner.
Those chores may include the following: Find good customers and convince them to buy. Deal with difficult, hard-to-please customers. Provide cost-effective customer service that retains customer loyalty. Understand financial statements, including balance sheets, profit and loss statements, and cash flow statements. Grant credit to customers and know how to grant it. Collect receivables. Juggle and prioritize the payment of payables. Understand the mystifying concept of cash flow and then figure out how to manage it. Compute inventory turn, days-in-receivables, current ratios, andreturn on sales.
Learn how to use such management tools as organization charts, job descriptions, and performance reviews. Learn how to Collect and disburse tax and other central and provincial governments dues. Learn how to protect yourself from lawsuits - both from your employees and your customers
You need to know how to hire, train, motivate, and hold employees accountable; control expenses; manage crises; balance cultures; deal with bankers; budget; forecast - the list goes on and on.
(We will be discussing all those items in the coming weeks.)
Of course, not all small businesses have to deal with all the items in the preceding list. If your business doesn’t have inventory, for example, you won’t have to deal with the myriad issues relating to it. Our point here is that the niche or idea won’t ultimately make or break your business; the day-to-day running of the business itself is what ultimately determines success - or failure.
Or stated another way, you show us a crackerjack business person, and we’ll show you someone who can get rich in the traditional sweets and confectionaries business whether or not he or she personally has the foggiest idea about how to bake anyone of those things.
Choosing your business
Finding the right business to buy or start can be a bit stressful, but you don’t need to be worried about it. This series of articles will offer plenty of help to assist you in matching your skills, interests, and job history with a suitable business, and they will also help you select the niche that works best for you, given who you are, what you like to do, and what you’re capable of doing.
Consider your category
Before you decide which business-venture would be best for you, you need to understand the four major business categories that you can consider:
Retailing, service, manufacturing, and wholesaling.
Let us talk about some important characteristics you need to know about these four categories:
Retailing: Retailing is the general category that most people are familiar with because the typical Sri Lankan deals with at least one retailer every day. Since most people are familiar with the retail business, the learning curve is usually much easier in retailing than in the other three categories. Also, because most retail businesses deal primarily with cash or near- cash equivalents (credit cards), funding requirements for accounts receivable are relatively low compared with some of the other business categories. That means, in turn, that the capital requirements for entry can be comparatively low, depending on how much inventory is required.
E-commerce (retailing over the Internet) is changing the parameters of the retailing category. The barrier to entry in retail-oriented entrepreneurial endeavours is becoming smaller as some successful retailing entrepreneurs choose web pages over storefronts. However, success online isn’t as easy or as lucrative as some would have you believe.
Service: The service industry is the fastest growing of the four categories, in part due to the low cost of entry. You typically need no significant inventory outlays and minimal equipment. Additionally, if you’re among the increasing number of service providers who choose to work out of their homes, occupancy expenses are relatively low and tax advantages are a potential perk.
Manufacturing: Save up your hard-earned cash if you’re thinking of becoming a manufacturer; this category is a veritable cash-guzzling machine. Inventory, accounts receivable, equipment, physical plant, employees - you name the cash-draining asset, and most manufacturers will have it. Although manufacturing is typically the most expensive of the four categories in terms of entry-level capital requirements, it offers great potential for rewards.
Look at the high-tech industry for examples of wealth being created (not just for the founders but for key employees as well) in short periods of time; companies such as Microsoft, Intel, and Apple were start-up manufacturers not that long ago.
Wholesaling: The middleman in capitalism’s distribution channel, wholesalers act as intermediaries between manufacturers and retailers or consumers. The wholesaler’s role is to buy large quantities of products at discounted prices (discounted from retail prices that is) from manufacturers, break them down into smaller quantities, and sell them at a mark-up to retailers or consumers.
Like manufacturers, wholesalers require significant cash outlays for inventory, receivables, physical plant, and employees; thus, the start-up capital requirements for wholesalers are correspondingly high.
Accidental opportunities
Many small-business owners are “accidental” entrepreneurs - that is, they stumble on a good business to start or buy. Maybe a favourite retail store suddenly comes up for sale, or a friend informs them of a can’t-miss opportunity, or a customer of the business they’re working for now invites them to do some freelance consulting - an invitation that turns into a business opportunity.
In these cases, the lucky entrepreneur doesn’t set out to own a business. Instead, he or she stumbles on the right opportunity. As with so many other directions people take in life, the time and the place just happen to be right. When considering your accidental opportunity, if you don’t enjoy what you’re about to do, your chances for success willdecrease. Make sure that your accidental opportunity is in a niche that you like.
Melissa Kieling is one such accidental entrepreneur. Single mom-turned businesswoman, Kieling founded PackIt, which makes foldable, freezable lunch bags and has been named one of the fastest growing privately held companies.
Kieling has said she started PackIt at her kitchen table after years of searching for ways to keep the fresh healthy lunches she packed for her kids from turning to tepid mush by lunchtime. Today, she has become the youngest self-made woman to make the Forbes Billionaire list.
Jan Koum, young man in Ukraine migrated to US at end of 90s. He has a large circle of friends in Ukraine and had a constant unmet need of communicating with them. He created WhatsApp to do so and the company was formed two years later. eBay and Facebook founders are also accidental” entrepreneurs.
Inventory of yourself
Make an Inventoryof your skills, interests, and job history
Most people aren’t lucky or fortunate enough to stumble upon the right business. And the kinds of people who discover the right business are often those who are willing to go to a lot of trouble to find good opportunities. If the perfect business opportunity doesn’t just fall into your lap (and, actually, even if it does), you need to do some introspection to determine what type of business is right for you.
There are a number of questions which can help you take an inventory of your business expertise and interests. (You can get a piece of paper and treat these questions like a quiz if you want to.) The answers you get will help you select the best possible business opportunity for you. We will go through them next week.
