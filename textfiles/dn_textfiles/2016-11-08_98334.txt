Jacqueline to set a Guinaness World Record

Jacqueline Fernandez with several hundred women will try to set a new Guinness World Record by holding an abdominal plank for 60 seconds at a garden in BKC. The 31-year-old actress, who has always promoted healthy living and eating, will headline the ‘Do You’ campaign which is close to her heart.
“It’s a movement which aims to inspire confidence in young girls, encouraging them to express their inherent beliefs, follow their instincts, find their best self, and be who they are, unapologetically,” Jacky told Mirror, pointing out that fitness is her way of loving herself.
The actress who plans to run the marathon next year is disturbed by the need to diet amongst young girls, pointing out that any kind of dieting without an exercise regimen to boost it is a waste of time. “Our bodies shouldn’t feel punished when we try to lose or gain weight. It’s only when the body is happy and satisfied that we inch towards fitness,” she explains.
Jacky is glad that with advancement in technology a woman doesn’t need to squeeze herself into a corset or slip into a killer pair of stiletto to look presentable.
“Today, it’s easy to find a pair of heels that are comfortable while making you feel like a diva on!” says the youth icon who can’t remember the last time she went into a tizzy over what not to wear or complained of sore feet.
“Times have changed and so has the idea of fashion. We should do what we want, wear what we want and not let the world dictate our personal choices!” she exclaims. “With age, looks fade, health doesn’t.” Mumbai Mirror
