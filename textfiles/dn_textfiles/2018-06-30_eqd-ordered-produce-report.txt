PTL recordings
EQD ordered to produce report

The Colombo Fort Magistrate yesterday issued an order directing the Government Examiner of Questioned Documents (EQD) to produce a report pertaining to four DVDs containing telephone conversation recordings submitted to the Bond Commission, since they appear to have been altered by Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL).
Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne made this order pursuant to a request made by Attorney General’s Department through a motion.
Senior State Counsel Lakmini Girihagama appearing on behalf of the Attorney General told Court that certain conversations in the four disks have been altered and erased before they were handed over to the Presidential Commission.
SSC Girihagama further told court that PTL CEO Kasun Palisena, Chief Dealer Nuwan Salgado and IT officer Sachitra Devathanthri under the instructions of PTL beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius have committed this offence.
Arjun Aloysius and its Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena, arrested in connection with the controversial Central Bank Bond issue, were yesterday ordered to be further remanded till July 5 by the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court.
