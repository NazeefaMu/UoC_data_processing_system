Stage calling

The Elizabeth Moir School annual Interhouse Drama competition was held on June 8 at the Western Province Aesthetic Resort.
Students were given the freedom to choose a short play under the theme “High School”. The four House dramas are produced almost entirely by the students themselves, from casting and direction to costumes and staging, with limited guidance from teachers.
The judges for the evening were Chalana Wijesuriya and Pia Hatch. The judges complimented the students on their efforts, and stated that they were particularly impressed by the consistently high standard of ensemble playing across all four Houses, as well as the attention to characterization, and creativity that the students demonstrated.
Colombus House emerged the overall winner, with their version of Ian McWethy’s “High School Reunion” which was praised for its imaginative staging and excellent ensemble playing.
The students also turned in superb individual performances. Fleming House almost swept the board with Eleanora Deemer and Leonid Mylvaganam winning Best Supporting Actress and Best Supporting Actor respectively, and Tienn Kapilasena capturing the Best Actor award. The Best Actress prize went to Sahaara Wijithananda of Armstrong House.
