Ava: Investigations into ‘weapons training’

Intelligence units have started an investigation into the allegation that several members of the criminal gang ‘Ava’ received weapons training in India, Law and Order Deputy Minister Nalin Bandara said.
He also said that the Sri Lanka Police are fully capable of controlling any underworld gang in the country including the Ava group.
Deputy Minister Bandara was speaking at a press briefing at Sirikotha, the UNP Headquarters yesterday afternoon.
“Police recently launched a large operation to curb the Ava group. They were able to take a leader of this gang into custody. There are larger underworld gangs in the southern part of the country. But people are worried about this Ava gang in fear of Prabhakaran and terrorism. Wherever the gangs are, the Sri Lanka Police are fully capable to controlling them,” Deputy Minister Bandara said.
