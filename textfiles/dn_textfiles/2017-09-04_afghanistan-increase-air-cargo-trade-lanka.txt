Afghanistan to increase  air cargo trade with Lanka

Afghanistan is planning to have air connectivity with Sri Lanka and would be looking at transporting goods through a cargo plane between the two countries soon, said Afghanistan Charge d’Affaires to Sri Lanka, Munir Ghiasy expressing his views as the Special Guest Speaker on the topic “Bilateral Trade Between Sri Lanka and Afghanistan” last week at the National Chamber of Commerce.
He said that they wanted to bring Afghanistan business delegation to Sri Lanka very soon and planned to promote businesses among the two countries.
“Our main target is to add one cargo plane once a month, that would boost trade between Afghanistan and Sri Lanka,” he said.
The total export value from Sri Lanka to Afghanistan was US$ 627,000 in 2016 and total imports from Afghanistan to Sri Lanka for the same period were US$ 48,000.
Sri Lanka’s main export products to Afghanistan in 2016 were books, printed matter, rubber tyres and tubes, desiccated coconut, tea, parts of refrigerating or freezing equipment.
The main import products from Afghanistan were telephone sets, toys and electrical transformers, processed food, precious stones, office machines, electric motors and generators.
