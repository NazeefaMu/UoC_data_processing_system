IT to be made compulsory in schools

Kurunegala District UNP Parliamentarian and Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said steps would be taken to make Information Technology a compulsory subject in the school curriculum.
Since the subject has become important in the jobs market, this will be implemented in Sri Lanka soon.
About 2,000 graduates who have IT degrees would be recruited soon to serve in government schools countrywide, Minister Kariyawasam said at a meeting of Directors of Education of the Kurunegala District recently.
