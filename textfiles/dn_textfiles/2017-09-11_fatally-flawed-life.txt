Fatally flawed life

This week Consultant Community Physician and the President of the Perinatal Society of Sri Lanka and the National Programme Manager of the Maternal and Child Morbidity and Mortality Surveillance of the Family Health Bureau, Health Ministry, Dr. KapilaJayaratne speaks about Lethal Congenital Malformations. This is a severe antenatal diagnosis of a severe congenital malformation associated wth profound grief, sadness and anger.
Q - What are Lethal Congenital Malformations (LCM)?
A - Abnormalities of the baby that originated in the uterus and are associated with death in the womb itself or in the newborn period are often referred to as ‘lethal congenital malformations’. Any structural or functional anomaly of organs, systems, or parts of the body that occurs during intrauterine life which is caused by genetic or environmental factors evident before birth, at birth or later in life are considered as Congenital Malformations or “birth defects”. Those conditions with the poorest prognosis are labeled ‘lethal’ particularly when the condition is associated with a high rate of prenatal (or stillbirth) or neonatal death. It is a condition which leads to death in utero or during the newborn period regardless of attempted supportive treatment. This is not a single entity.
They include a heterogenous group of conditions as there are a multitude of individually rare conditions termed ‘lethal.’

To list some of them; Potter’s syndrome/renal agenesis, Anencephaly/acrania, Thanatophoric dwarfism, Trisomy 13 or 18, Holoprosencephaly, Severe osteogenesisimperfecta, Multicystic/dysplastic kidneys, Triploidy, Hydranencephaly, Congenital severe hydrocephalus with absent or minimal brain growth, Severe congenital diaphragmatic hernia with hypoplastic lungs. WHO estimates 303, 000 newborns die within four weeks of birth every year, worldwide, due to all types of congenital anomalies. The estimated figure for Sri Lanka is 500 – 600. A major proportion of stillbirths are also due to birth defects. These statistics also show the importance of congenital anomalies as a major cause of perinatal, neonatal, and infant deaths.
Q –How can Lethal Congenital Malformations be diagnosed?
A – Being aheterogenous group of conditions, screening or diagnostic tests vary. Some conditions may be apparent early in the pregnancy and some in the latter part of pregnancy.
Gross malformations may be detected by ultrasound scans. The use of routine mid-trimester ultrasound screening picks many of the diagnosis of major congenital malformations. In many parts of the world, major malformations are discovered before birth. Several conditions necessitate blood investigations of the mother or the fetus. Antenatal screening follows targeted diagnostic testing for specific LCM.
Q –How can the mother and the fetus be treated once diagnosed ?
A – The diagnosis of an LCM has potential ethical and legal implications.
They need different antenatal or obstetric management depending on the underlying abnormality. The interventions may be focused on both maternal and baby’s well-being.
However, as the presence of a lethal malformation precludes any benefit to the fetus from the pregnancy continuing, many countries offer termination of pregnancy within their legal framework. As termination of pregnancy is only possible if the mother’s life in danger in Sri Lanka, the only option available is continuation of pregnancy until baby dies or till he is born.
In this background, ethical issues arise on what treatment should be offered or provided to women and to fetuses and babies with a high chance of death despite treatment. The pain and suffering of the mother, living children and family is inevitable in Sri Lanka.
Within the contexts our healthcare teams proceed with planning of delivery, counseling and education of couples and earlier supportive postnatal intervention for newborns with lethal congenital malformations. It is also a burden to the health system, society and the country as they consume a huge proportion of healthcare facilities and budgets as well.
Q –How can Lethal Congenital Malformations be prevented?
A – In about 50 percent of all congenital anomalies cannot be linked to a specific cause. Although there are some known genetic, environmental and other causes or risk factors, a specific plausibility cannot be attributed in many. However, in certain genetic conditions it may be possible to predict. Therefore, genetic counseling and birth defect screening, particularly if couples have any family history of birth defects or the mother is 35 years of age or older can be of use to prevent the pain caused by this condition. Other advice includes controlling diabetes and avoiding harmful substances. We advocate carefully planned pregnancies in ideal age with ideal body weight and attending to pre-existing illnesses. Pre-pregnancy counseling for high risk couples is also recommended.
* Annually 500 – 600 congenital anomalies are reportedin Sri Lanka
* As termination of pregnancy is only possible if the mother’s life in danger in Sri Lanka, the only option available is continuation of pregnancy until baby dies or till he is born.
* As the presence of a lethal malformation precludes any benefit to the fetus from the pregnancy continuing, many countries offer termination of pregnancy within their legal framework.
* LCM is also a burden to the health system, society and the country as they consume a huge proportion of healthcare facilities and budgets.
