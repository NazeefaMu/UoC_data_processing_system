Who inspired you to maintain physical fitness and good looks?
More than an inspiration it was more of my own passion towards fitness. I firmly believe health is better than wealth.
I have another passion which is professional education.
I aspire to blend fitness with brains and to be a role-model to young Sri Lankan models.
Tell us about your background.
I hail from Matale and I am the eldest in a family of three.
After my education at St Thomas College, Matale, and Science College, Matale, I pursued higher education. I graduated from National School of Business Management in Computer Science.
I have been a sports enthusiast from schooling days and have played cricket and done athletics, specializing in 100-200 meters.
I also enjoy hiking, orienteering and rock climbing, watching movies and going to the gym.
You won the title of ‘Mister Sri Lanka’ prior to representing Sri Lanka at the ‘Man of the World 2017’. Tell us about you the time you vied to become Mister Sri Lanka and representing ‘Man of the World 2017’.
I never thought I could achieve the title of Mister Sri Lanka. It all happened subsequent to a casting test.
This particular casting test opened new vistas in my life, paving way for a modeling career. Modeling was my window to venture into the Mister Sri Lanka contest in 2016 and to win the title.
I always had faith and courage in everything I did. I worked hard in every little thing I did and always tried my best. I continue to do so.
This was the first edition of ‘Man of the World’. How does this contest differ from Mister World and Mister International contests?
All international contests have their own themes which are their core competencies.
‘Man of the World 2017’ Pageant had its theme, ‘Celebrating Masculinity with Responsibility’.
The pageant also looks for men who are geared with the five attributes; Masterly, Mindful, Manly, Masculine and Modern.
The winner gets openings to work with different agencies in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore and he will have opportunities as an international model and to be in the entertainment sector.
Share your experiences at ‘Man of the World 2017’.
All the contestants were very friendly.
We visited many beautiful and cultural places in the Philippines. My favourite place was Negros Oriental Dumaguete, one of the most beautiful islands I have ever seen.
I made many friends there, but the ones who were closest to me were Mr Vietnam, Mr Gibraltar, Mr Cape Verde, Mr Algeria, Mr Nepal, Mr Zambia and Mr China.
Not having time to be in the gym and to have a good night’s sleep was a drawback for all of us. Some contestants fell ill due to extensive travelling.
Though the pageant was very tiring it was a worthwhile experience I will always treasure.
My national costume was admired by everyone.
There were 29 Contestants and you were in the top 18 Semi- finalists.
How did you feel when that was announced?
I liked that recognition. However I was not overjoyed by that fact. We all focused on maintaining our motivation levels and positive frame of mind until the end of the pageant.
Who helped and guided you to represent Sri Lanka?
My family was the greatest strength behind my success. National Director Brian Kerkoven guided and encouraged me a lot.
Sameera Weerasinghe, Hiran Wijesekera, Kamil Hewavitharana helped me with my wardrobe and provided general guidance. I also thank Sanka media team and all the friends and fellow Sri Lankans who supported me in one way or another.
How do you think Sri Lankan youth should prepare themselves for international contests of this nature?
There should be more encouragement from the organizers and authorities towards events of this nature. Another aspect is providing more effective training. We must adopt modern methods of training aiming at global pageants and benchmark with global standards.
Contestants must be familiar with the international standards. They must be shown what it takes to represent a country at these types of events.
What is in store for you for the future?
I look forward to moving on with my modeling career and move up the career ladder with professional education. I want to add value to the modeling sphere with my skills.
