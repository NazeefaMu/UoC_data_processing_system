Maersk  embraces  its new  stingray

Maersk Supply Service has taken delivery of Maersk Installer, an 8,300 dwt subsea support vessel (SSV), from COSCO (Dalian) Shipyard.
As informed, the delivery documents were signed between the two parties on October 16, 2017.
Maersk Installer is the first of four Stingray class SSVs scheduled for delivery in 2017 and 2018.
Flying the flag of Danish International Register, the 14,100 gross-ton ship features a length of 137 meters and a width of 27 meters. The newbuilding currently has a market value of USD 92.64 million, according to data provided by VesselsValue.
“Maersk Supply Service's new Stingray subsea support vessels are built to carry out a wide range of deep and shallow water operations in challenging offshore environments. The vessels have flexible features with a large free deck, a 400t crane and 120 ... single-cabins,” Carsten Gran Haagensen, Chief Commercial Officer at Maersk Supply Service, explained.
“The vessels have been designed with energy efficiency as a key design parameter, keeping the fuel consumption at a very low level. The four Stingray new-buildings will be a crucial part of Maersk Supply Service's future fleet allowing us to offer a broader scope of services,” Haagensen added.
