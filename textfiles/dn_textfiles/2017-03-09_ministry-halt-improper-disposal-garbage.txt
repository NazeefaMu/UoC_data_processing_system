Ministry to halt improper disposal of garbage

The Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry will take steps to solve issues pertaining to improper disposal of garbage, Minister Faiszer Musthapha said.
A discussion was held at the Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry yesterday to address the issues of the people who held a protest on Monday regarding relocating the Meetotamulla garbage dump. The minister said President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe have looked into the matter. He said he won’t allow the individuals to make the garbage crisis a political platform in the forthcoming Local Government elections.
Minister Musthapha said: “The Meetotamulla garbage dump has been a political platform of the politicians of the area for a long time. People were deceived. No one needed to solve the issues of the people who suffered. I will be able to put an end to the problem with the assistance of the President and the Prime Minister.
The maha sangha, Parliamentarian S.H.M. Marikkar, Ministry Secretary Kamal Padmasiri, officers from the Colombo Municipal Council, tri forces, the Police and the representatives from the Urban Development Authority also participated at the discussion.
