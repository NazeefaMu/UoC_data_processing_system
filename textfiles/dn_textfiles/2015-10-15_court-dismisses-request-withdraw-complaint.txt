He maintained that in accordance with the provisions of Criminal Procedure Code such a request to withdraw a complaint only could be brought by the police or Attorney General who involved in the investigation.
Meanwhile, Senior State Counsel Dilan Ratnayake submitted to Court that though the virtual complainant had lodged a complaint regarding an abduction incident, several other serious offences had been transpired against the suspect following the investigations.
Meanwhile, SSC Ratnayake further stated that the Attorney General would take necessary steps to indict the suspect in High Court over an offence under Section 80-1 of the Presidential Election Act and charge of mentally abusing a child.
