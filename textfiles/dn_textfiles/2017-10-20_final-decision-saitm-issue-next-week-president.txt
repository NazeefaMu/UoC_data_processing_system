Final decision on SAITM issue by next week - President

The Government will reach a final decision on the issue surrounding South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) by next week, President Maithripala Sirisena stated yesterday.
The President noted the above in his speech as the chief guest at the 2017 convocation of Aquinas University College in Borella.
The President went on to say that the government had taken a number of measures to solve the SAITM issue in the past and added he hoped the solution given by the government next week will be accepted by those who are agitating against the private medical college.
The President went on to say that it was the obligation of higher educational institutions in the country to ensure the highest quality and standards when it came to the education programmes offered by them.
President added that both the state and private higher educational institutions should produce more and more accomplished graduates who could support new innovations and the country’s development.
The Archbishop of Colombo His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, Aquinas College Rector Susith Mark Lal Silva and Ministers John Amaratunge and Joseph Micheal Perera were among the participants.
