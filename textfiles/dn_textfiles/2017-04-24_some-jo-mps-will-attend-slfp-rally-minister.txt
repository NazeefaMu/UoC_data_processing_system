Some JO MPs will attend SLFP rally: Minister

A group of Joint Opposition Parliamentarians is billed to attend the SLFP May Day rally held at Getambe, Kandy presided over by President Maithripala Sirisena, said Petroleum Resources Development Minister Chandima Weerakkody.
When asked by the media to name the Parliamentarians, Minister Weerakkody said: “Wait till May Day. You will see who they are.” Meanwhile, Parliamentarian Dr. Ramesh Pathirana said, no one in the Joint Opposition would attend the Kandy SLFP May Day rally.
They would all attend the Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna May Day rally at Galle Face Green, which would be recorded as the largest May Day rally this year.
He said the true May Day rally of the working class would be the rally at Galle Face presided over by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
