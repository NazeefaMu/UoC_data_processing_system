Danger of methane eruption at Gohagoda dump eased

 
The danger of methane eruption at Gohagoda garbage dump site has eased with the rains in Kandy on Monday, Peradeniya University Geological Department Prof Athula Senaratne said.
“After the rains, the moisture content has gone up and temperature inside the dump has lowered. This will result in less methane generation and therefore there will not be a methane emission as experienced a few days ago,” he told the Daily News
Prof Senaratne said he would visit the Tekkawatta garbage dump in Gohagoda today for further studies. “The gas smell in the area is still very strong. Various gases like Methane, Ammonia and Hydrogen Sulfide are found inside the dump” he added.
He also said the possibility of landslides are found at least at three places of the garbage dump, adding that the officials of the National Building Research Organization (NBRO) were probing to ascertain whether there is an imminent danger.
Asked about the landslide risk, NBRO Landslide Research and Risk Management Division Director R M S Bandara said, “Possibilities are there, but we are yet to determine whether there is any imminent danger. The NBRO is conducting studies and will make our official recommendations later”.
