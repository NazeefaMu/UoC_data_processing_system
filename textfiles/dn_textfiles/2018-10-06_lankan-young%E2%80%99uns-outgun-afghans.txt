Enter U19 Asia Cup final
Lankan young’uns outgun Afghans

Sri Lanka’s young guns did what their seniors failed to do when they defeated Afghanistan by 31 runs in the semi-finals of the ACC Under 19 Asia Cup at Dhaka yesterday and qualify for the final with India.
Sri Lanka’s victory was largely due to an excellent century from former St Sebastian’s College Moratuwa right-hander Nawanidu Fernando whose innings of 111 off 129 balls was the cornerstone on which they built their total of 209-7 in 50 overs.
Afghanistan who got off to a good start being 84-1 at one stage collapsed to 178 all out in 48.3 overs to the left-arm orthodox spin of former St Servatius College, Matara cricketer Shashika Dulshan who ended up with figures of 4 for 24.
Sri Lanka got off to one of their worst starts when both openers were dismissed without scoring to be 0-2 in the second over. They lost half the side for 99 before Fernando joined by skipper Nipun Dananjaya (27) rescued the side with a face-saving 67-run stand for the sixth wicket.
Sri Lanka will meet India in the final at Dhaka on Sunday.
Scores: Sri Lanka (U19) 209-7 in 50 overs (Nawanidu Fernando 111, Kalana Perera 22, Nipun Dananjaya 27, Pasindu Sooriyabandara 19 n.o., Abdul Rahman 3/42)
Afghanistan (U19) 178 in 48.3 overs (Rahmatullah Gurbaz 46, Baseer Khan 27, Arif Khan 20, Ijaz 37, Kalhara Senaratne 2/41, Shahika Dulshan 4/24, Navod Paranavithana 2/17)
