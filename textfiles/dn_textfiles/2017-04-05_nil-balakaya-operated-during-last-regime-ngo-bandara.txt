Nil Balakaya operated during last regime like NGO: Bandara

National Youth Front Chairman Shantha Bandara said that the Nil Balakaya which operated during the last regime was a NGO of a certain person but not a government project.
"Unlike the Nil Balakaya, the SLFP Youth Front operates under this government," .
Bandara speaking about the Joint Opposition’s May Day preparations, said that the JO is afraid of holding their May Day rally at Galle Face Green.
“Due to the fear the JO members are saying various things including they are going to surround Temple Trees and President’s Secretariat on May day” he said.
Commenting on this Bandara said that the JO can surround the Temple Trees and the President’s Secretariat on other day.
The JO earlier though that they would not be given the Gall Face Green but once they received it they are afraid of filling the premises with people.
“The JO members think when they say that they are going to surround the Temple Trees and the President’s Secretariat, the Police will not permit them to hold the Mayday rally at Galle Face Green as it is a threat to national security,” Bandara said.
