Perpetual Treasuries spread happiness  to children of Sabaragamuwa

Initiating a long term project, Perpetual Treasuries identified a number of students from 48 schools in the Sabaragamuwa Province who needed support in order to continue and develop their standard of education.
All students from Grades 01 to 13 of the schools classified as ‘Very Difficult’ received all items required in a standard book list, including a water bottle and lunch box.
As an investment company that has made it their mission to support the growth and development of Sri Lanka’s capital market, Perpetual Treasuries believes that promoting the cause of education is the most suitable manner in which to invest in the future of the next generation.
The organization has announced that the project launched in January this year will eventually expand to all the provinces in the country. The main objective is to elevate the standards of schools step-by-step resulting in an islandwide development programme, which supports national education.
“This is not just about donating books”, stated Arjun Aloysius, Chairman of Perpetual Group. “This project represents much more than that. As education is a basic right for every child, we want to provide these children with the means to receive a better and more wholesome education. We want to attribute a deeper meaning to ‘Investment’ within the corporate world. Financial investment is only a small part of it.”
“Our real investment has to be on the future and this is where our future comes from. The schools we selected were in dire need of support and we at Perpetual were more than happy to provide them with the necessities of elevating their standards and facilities”.
Licensed by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Perpetual Treasuries is a non-bank primary dealer, whose team has dedicated themselves to the task of connecting both local and international investors with opportunities in Sri Lanka’s debt and equity markets, while supporting growth and development in the nation’s capital markets through the provision of specialized investment services.
