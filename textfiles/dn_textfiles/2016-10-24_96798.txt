Wenger rues costly Cazorla absence

Arsenal's Wenger bemoaned the absence of Santi Cazorla after Arsenal were held to a drab goalless draw by struggling Middlesbrough.
Cazorla did not feature at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday and the Spanish midfielder was sorely missed by the spluttering Gunners.
Arsenal were frustrated by Middlesbrough as they wasted a chance to win for a seventh successive Premier League game and eighth in all competitions.
“You always miss Cazorla at home. From deep midfield into the final third his pass is always quick, accurate,” said Wenger, whose side will be knocked out of first place if Manchester City avoid defeat against Southampton on Sunday.
“Cazorla, I don't really know when he will be back. We have to see how he recovers on Monday.”
There was better news on France striker Olivier Giroud who is now set to return for Arsenal's home League Cup game with Reading on Tuesday.
“We didn't make enough from our set-pieces and crosses. So the first thing that comes to mind is whether a guy with more size and physical presence in the box could have helped,” said Wenger.
“But we have just come out of six straight wins so I wouldn't like to jump on this kind of excuse.
“We have to deal with what we face and unfortunately we are used to scoring. We are an offensive team. “We had five or six offensive players on the pitch at the end but we didn’t manage to score so it's a bit frustrating.
“It's part of the Premier League. The other day Manchester City had a similar possession against Everton and didn't win.
“We have to find a way to be efficient even when the games are like that.”
- Tired legs -
Wenger, whose side had beaten Ludogorets 6-0 in the Champions League on Wednesday, saw the Gunners run out of ideas and it was his own goalkeeper Petr Cech forced into a string of saves.
