SPC meeting proceeds amidst protests

Proceedings of the Southern Provincial Council meeting held yesterday were obstructed for nearly 45 minutes at the beginning owing to an abrupt protest launched by a group of United People’s Freedom Alliance councillors loyal to Joint Opposition.
The group of councillors who entered the council chamber wearing black cloth strips on their arms expressed their objection over the alleged authoritative administrative conduct of Southern Province Governor Dr. Hema Kumara Nanayakkara and the removal of North Central Province Council Chairman by way of a no confidence motion subjected to serious contentions within political circles.
The policy statement of the fourth session of the seventh Southern Provincial Council presented by the governor on July 4 was to be debated according to yesterday’s agenda of the meeting.
However, challenging the scheduled programme, Councillor Chamly Witanachchi speaking on behalf of the protesting group told the house that they would leave the house in protest of the commanding nature of administration of the Southern Province Governor and the removal of the Chairman of North Central Provincial Council. Councillor D.V. Upul also made a number of charges against the governor.
While the council meeting was in progress about 10 am, Councillor Channa Saliya Mendis entered the chamber carrying a mock up of a till box to which the Chairman objected and ordered him to keep it outside the chamber and enter.
Members who resisted the chairman’s order came into the middle of the chamber with the till box to which opposition members vehemently opposed. Subsequently, Council members Chandana Priyantha who approached Mendis and tried to grab the till box from him to which UPFA members resisted.
