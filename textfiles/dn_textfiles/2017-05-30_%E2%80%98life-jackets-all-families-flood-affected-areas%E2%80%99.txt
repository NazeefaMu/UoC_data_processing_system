‘Life jackets for all families in flood affected areas’

“The government will provide life jackets to all families in flood affected areas,” Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena said. Two thousand life jackets were already distributed among those who had not left their houses despite the flooding, Minister Abeywardena said.
“If victims receive life jackets, they will be able to stay safe until they are rescued,” Minister Abeywardena said.
“Some people do not leave their houses disregarding the dangerous situation they are in. They keep climbing up until they reach the roofs and calls for emergency rescue units only after when they realise that they are in jeopardy. Life jackets will be provided taking into account this situation,” Minister Abeywardena said.
