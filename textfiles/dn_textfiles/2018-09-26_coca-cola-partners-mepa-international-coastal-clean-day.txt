Coca-Cola partners with MEPA  on International Coastal Clean-up Day

Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd. (CCBSL) partnered with the Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA) to collect PET bottles for recycling, at the National Program of the International Coastal Clean-up Day at Daddala Beach in Galle.
The event also included recycler Eco-Spindles Pvt Ltd. (BPPL Group) and volunteers from AIESEC partnering to demonstrate the positive impact of ‘Harnessing the power of people towards an Ocean without Waste’ under the patronage and active involvement of President Maithripala Sirisena.
The initiative is part for The Coca-Cola Company’s commitment towards help creating a “World Without Waste”. World Without Waste is the Coca-Cola Company’s global goal to help collect and recycle the equivalent of 100% of its packaging by 2030. This goal is the centrepiece of the company’s new packaging vision in Sri Lanka as well.
Rear Admiral (Retd) Rohana Perera, Chairman of Marine Environment Protection Authority said, “The risk of pollution of the ocean around Sri Lanka is increasing daily due to the influence of increased use of contaminants connected with development activities and increasing population. Large quantities of non-degradable waste get absorbed into coast and marine environments directly or through the waterways.”
Commenting on the successful initiative, Lakshan Madurasinghe Country Public Affairs, Communications and Sustainability Manager, Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd. said, “The Give Back Life program’s long-term vision is to work with host of strategic partners to deliver meaningful action towards a circular economy in which materials are used and reused to provide ongoing value. Following last year’s successful partnership of this same event, Coca-Cola is delighted to cement its association yet again in 2018.”
Natasha Perera, National Director – Partnership Development of AIESEC Sri Lanka commented, “AIESEC is delighted to take a proactive step in preserving our marine environment by partnering the International Coastal Clean-up Day.”
Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd. partners at this event as part of its extended producer responsibility, to “Give Back Life” to collect marine debris along beaches. Throughout the National Marine Resources Week, all PET bottles collected by the volunteers would be collected and recycled through its partnership with Eco-Spindles (part of BPPL Holdings). The PET will then be upcycled into janitorial products for household and commercial use and yarn, thus utilising the maximum value of PET.
