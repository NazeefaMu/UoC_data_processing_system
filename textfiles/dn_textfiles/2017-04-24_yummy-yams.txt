Yummy yams!

Yams are a widely used culinary favorite in Sri Lanka due to its taste and its added health benefits. It is an inclusion in any menu, be it at a wedding or a house party or a simple homely meal. Garden Talk speaks to Homagama Agriculture Instructor H.A. Indika Gunasena on this food item that is in high demand in our society.
"Sri Lanka is a country rich in floral diversity and this has a considerable number of edible and non-edible roots and tuber varieties. This important resource is commonly known as 'yams.' These include roots and tubers indigenous to the country as well as some varieties introduced and naturalized in the country. All these root and tuber plants also had a number of unique characters in cultivation including disease resistance and the ability to flourish in low fertile soils and not much attention is required. The traditional knowledge of the cultivation of these roots and tubers passed on from generation to generation.

These edible roots and tubers were an important food source and was a component of the diet of the community in the past. Some of these roots and tubers possess special characteristics such as certain medicinal values and food qualities which were identified in the time immemorial and passed from generation to generation. In general, these plants are high in proteins, calories, minerals and vitamins. They are low in fats and sugars. This however varies, depending on the varieties," said Gunasena.
There are yams which grow above the earth and that which grow below the soil. Udala is a variety that grows above the soil. All other varieties of yams grow below the soil.
"In Sri Lanka there are more than 50 varieties of Yams. Most of these are traditional Yams. These are Yams that are found in forests but introduced to home gardening by farmers and cultivated in home gardens

Now Potato is Yam which is an upcountry vegetable, that was introduced to our consumption from abroad. It is an introduction. And it has become highly successful. It is very popular and is grown and produced widely in Sri Lanka. It fast grew in popularity, even more than Manioc and Sweet Potato. It goes with so many other foods. It is also genetically enhanced when it comes to size and yield. It is in high demand in Sri Lanka. The up country climate is also suitable for potatoes. It is a crop that is high yielding. It is also easily cooked with a delicious taste of its own," explained Gunasena When it comes to Potatoes, the climate in Sri Lanka is ideal in the up country. It is highly suitable for Sri Lanka.
Yams can be divided basically into two - Traditional Yams and Popular Varieties.
"These Traditional Yams are found mostly in rural areas but are not cultivated widely. We have grown to like Potatoes. It can be easily cooked. You can even make potato chips! It has a taste of its own. When you take traditional yams, they are only found in rural divisions. They are not done on a large scale because it is difficult to find planting material. They are only done on a home gardening level. It is for home consumption. It cannot be grown on acres and hectares because you simply cannot find planting material," pointed out Gunasena People are used to eating mainly Potatoes. That is the main Yam. When it comes to Traditional Yams farmer are not inclined to produce on a large scale. Farmers are not interested - because the yield in popular varieties is higher and the planting material is also more. Traditional yams are mainly used for home consumption.
"When you take Traditional Varieties (Yams), they can be done on a large scale, but farmers are simply not interested. When it comes to cultivation, cultivating popular varieties is much easier as you can find planting materials," added Gunasena
These traditional yams are found mostly in the Wet Zone and in the Dry Zone, though they may not be endemic to Sri Lanka. You don't find traditional yams in the market, because the cultivation is low. When it comes to popular varieties, the cultivation is easier with a high yield.
"When it comes to traditional it is difficult to sell because people are not used to it. People may not even know what 'Raja Ala' is. It is good for high blood pressure, it gives good muscular strength. It is good for hair. It reduces obesity. It is good food for babies. It is good for pregnant mothers," informed Gunasena
When you take traditional yams since it is not done on large scale cultivation the planting material is less. When you take popular varieties since it is done on a large scale the planting material is more.
