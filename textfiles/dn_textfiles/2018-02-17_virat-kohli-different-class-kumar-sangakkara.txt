Virat Kohli is of a different class: Kumar Sangakkara

Indian skipper Virat Kohli just needs 176 ODIs and 166 innings to get past Sanga’s mark and notch up No. 26. This is October 2016 we are discussing. He has played 29 ODIs since then. Kohli already has 34 hundreds and is 15 short of Sachin Tendulkar’s world record tally.
In fact, he has scored 12 hundreds (as many Dravid scored in his career and two more than Dhoni) in his last 40 ODIs.
Kohli finished 2017 with 2,818 runs across formats, the most by any cricketer and third-most by any batsman in a calendar year.
Sangakkara’s tally of 2,868 in 2014 still tops the charts. Kohli could have gone past Sanga’s tally had he played the ODIs and T20Is against Sri Lanka.
However, Sanga had famously remarked last year: “I don’t think that will last long the way Kohli is batting. He will probably overtake it next year and then do it again the year after. He is a different class.”
Sri Lankan legendary batsmen Kumar Sangakkara finished his ODI career with 25 hundreds. He registered his last hundred in his penultimate ODI, his 403rd (379th innings) to be precise.
This is Sangakkara, one of the finest batsmen to grace the sport and he finished with fourth-most three-figures in ODIs, behind Sachin Tendulkar (49), Ricky Ponting (30) and countryman Sanath Jayasuriya (28).
To put things into perspective, Rahul Dravid has 12 hundreds from 344 ODIs (318 innings), MS Dhoni 10 from 310 (270 innings) and Mohammad Azharuddin 7 from 334 (308 innings).
We are talking of giants in one-day cricket. Sanga’s conversion rate does stand out.
