Can-Sur-Vive  gives hope to Breast Cancer patients

A hall full of tangible energy, hope and positive attitude, exuded the length and breadth of Lanka Hospitals 10th floor auditorium when women of all sizes and walks of life spent a day; some in remission and most in clearance of what was once could have been a terminal illness; Breast Cancer.
Observing International Cancer Day in the month of February, Can-Sur-Vive, in collaboration with Jetwing group conducted the 5th ‘CAN – SUR – VIVE’ CSR program on January 28, 2016 at the Lanka Hospitals.
The workshop aimed to actively educate survivors of breast cancer on medical, physical, financial, spiritual and other related aspects pertaining directly to a cancer survivor’s well-being while reinstating the survivors’ and family members’ confidence.
“Cancer is undoubtedly a deadly and in certain cases, a fatal disease – however, what affects patients more is the lack of understanding, empathy, and support they have during their ordeals.
Even survivors to a great extent pull through not just because of medicine, but because of their own determination. Jetwing has partnered with the CAN-SUR-VIVE Trust ever since inception; as we truly appreciate their efforts to educate both patients and survivors through a variety of unique sessions, and because we have always believed in the power and potential of people to overcome.

Their commitment shows that no one is truly ever alone – you always have the help and support you need, as a community,” said Hiran Cooray – Chairman of Jetwing Group.
The workshop, which was conceived by Consultant Oncological Surgeon of Lanka Hospitals PLC, Dr. Naomal Perera, focuses on the lives of breast cancer survivors and their role in society.
The Can-Sur-Vive Trust, has been fully functional for the last one year and is being held for the benefit of the survivors, with the main purpose being to register as many survivors for additional assistance they may require with their everyday lives.
‘’Can – Sur- Vive workshops address the issues faced by the survivors of breast cancer – their psychological needs, Physical and sexual issues stemming from disfiguration and therapy as well as many other important topics such as nutrition and exercise” said Dr. Naomal Perera.
