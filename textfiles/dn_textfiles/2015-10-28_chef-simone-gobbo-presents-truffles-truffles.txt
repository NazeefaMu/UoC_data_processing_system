Chef Simone Gobbo presents 'Truffles & Truffles'

Water's Edge together with its food and wine consultant Leonardo Ricci and Italian culinary maestro Chef Simone Gobbo will present 'Truffles & Truffles', a special evening of authentic dishes featuring rare White Truffles dubbed by many as the most expensive ingredient in the kitchen on November 5, 8pm onwards at The Link, Waters Edge.
Truffles which are essentially a unique variety of mushroom are usually found growing in close proximity to roots of several tree species including beech, poplar, oak, birch, hornbeam, hazel, and pine. The prized White Truffle is found only a few times a year mainly in the Langhe and Montferrat areas of northern Italy and, most famously, in the countryside around the cities of Alba and Asti. It is from these regions that the Water's Edge will specially ship down truffles promising local guests a truly gourmand experience.
White truffles will be included in such gastronomical delights as poached eggs served with white truffle, pumpkin soup with white truffle shavings, Prosecco and casatella D'Altamarca risotto, slow cooked beef chicks, leeks foam and crushed potatoes with white truffles and passion fruit meringue, vanilla mouse, almond and candied fruit sponge topped with white truffles for dessert prepared by Chef Simone who is the consultant for the Waters Edge's authentic Italian restaurant Pranzo. To add a touch of class to the evening, Sommelier and Consultant Leonardo will use his refined knowledge of things fine to couple the dishes with the perfect wines.
"Water's Edge is synonymous with novelty and this time around we introduce one of the most unique and sought after ingredients in global kitchens, the truffle. In keeping with our tradition to bring only the best to our guests, our ingredients are being brought down specially from Italy and will be used in dishes skillfully prepared by our culinary experts. We look forward to a great evening", Water's Edge General Manager Rohan Fernandopulle noted.
To coincide with the special dinner, Waters Edge will also serve a range of Black Truffle dishes at the Pranzo on an à-la-carte basis from November 4 to the 8. For reservations for the "Truffles & Truffles" promotion please call Nishara on 0777251775.
