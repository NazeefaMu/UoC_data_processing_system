Supplementary medial staff on strike today

Trade unions of the professions supplementary to medicine will launch a token strike today (October 3) at 8.00 am, Union President Ajith P. Thilakaratne said.
According to Thilakaratne, Pharmacists, Medical laboratory Technicians, Radiographers, Physiotherapists and Occupational Therapists will refrain from duties from 8.00 am today to 8.00 am tomorrow (Wednesday). The strike will be launched presenting several demands.
Salary issues, promotions, service issues, allowances, and transfer issues are long standing burdens for the professionals. But no answers had been given by the authorities so far, he said.
The strike will be launched since previous discussions failed and the promises made during the discussions were not kept. The Health authorities were ignoring the problems faced by health professionals, he said.
