South west monsoon rains begin

Meteorology Department Director K.H.M. Premalal said the present rainy and cloudy condition is expected to continue over the most parts of the country until May 20.
This is due to a low level atmospheric disturbance in the vicinity of Sri Lanka associated with Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (the low pressure zone where the Northern and Southern hemispheric winds meet).
Premalal said the South-West monsoon rain is expected to begin around May 25. But this year it has begun early due to the low pressure zone.
He said heavy rain can be further expected due to the formation of Inter Tropical Convergence Zone and the low pressure area in the central Bay of Bengal which can be expected in coming weeks.
‘We have issued an advisory for heavy rain, strong winds and rough seas in the Western, Southern and Eastern sea areas of the island.
There is a possibility of heavy showers or thundershowers and sudden roughness, associated with sudden increase of wind speed (up to 70 to 80 kmph) in the sea areas off the coast extending from Colombo to Batticaloa via Galle and Pottuvil.
Naval and fishing communities are also requested to be vigilant in this regard, he added.
The Meteorology Department will deploy two Doppler weather radar in Pottuvil and Puttalam while developing 76 tsunami detection buoys set up across the country to provide accurate weather predictions in the future. Compensation for the damaged houses has been increased from Rs.100,000 to Rs 2.5 million while compensation for human fatalities due to disasters caused by natural hazards has been increased by Rs.25,000 to Rs.100,000 by the government.
