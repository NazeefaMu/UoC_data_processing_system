Deepal’s Inward Bound proves effective in the corporate world

Deepal Sooriyaarachchi presented a copy of his book titled Inward Bound for Mindful Living to Ven Ajahan Brahm during his recent visit to Sri Lanka. He interviewed Ajahn Brahm on Mindfulness and many related topics and they can be viewed you tube.
Inward Bound was first published in UK and subsequently released as a Sarasavi publication making it more affordable to the local reader.
Written in a very simple language Deepal explores the topic of Mindfulness, how to practice it by busy executives and shares a number of deep insights that can be gained by the practice. The book has been well received by the readers.
