Primary Industries policy  to be export-driven - Minister

An export-supportive national policy will be implemented promptly to achieve national goals set by the Primary Industries Ministry, Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage said.
The main objective of establishing the Primary Industries Ministry in 2015 was to assist the government to reach its development goals. Under these objectives, it has been planned to obtain US$ 25 billion annually from exports and create one million job opportunities by 2025 through import substitution policies.
The minister made these remarks recently while addressing a workshop on preparing the export-supportive national plan at the ministry.
Development of a national policy for primary industries is important to boost the export sector. The initial conceptual framework of the national policy has already been developed, he said.
“The Ministry of Primary Industries was established in 2015 with the intention of developing Sri Lanka’s primary industries. The MPI seeks to promote economic development in order to realise the government’s development goals of achieving US$ 25 billion in exports and creating one million employment opportunities by 2025 through import substitution policies,” he added.
The key objective of establishing the ministry is to promote exports and export more value-added products which have a significant value in the global market, Minister Gamage said.
“With diverse agricultural zones allowing enormous potential for agro-industry and access to a large fishing area, Sri Lanka’s primary industries are the backbone of the economy and have much to offer both local and foreign investors in the agriculture, livestock and fisheries sectors,” he added.
The minister, while continuing his speech, said that the private sector is considered as an important stakeholder in the development arena.
Hence, having considered the importance of private sector involvement, the ministry is taking every possible measure to uplift private sector industries.
Accordingly, the main focus of the ministry is on support for the private sector, including smallholders, and for private sector–led development pathways, through value addition and exports. Therefore the ministry works to enrich the economy and drive trade and investment forward through the management and sustainable utilisation of the country’s natural resources and through enhancing value chain development.
At the heart of primary industry development is the goal of increasing the value of primary sector assets such as agriculture, horticulture and fisheries, by focusing on projects that will lead to sustainably increasing productivity, protecting our land and water from harmful pests and diseases, safeguarding our diverse and unique natural environment, encouraging an innovation culture through technological development, taking measures to ensure food quality and integrity, and creating a platform for sustainable economic growth in order to ensure the best social and economic outcomes for Sri Lanka.
The minister further emphasised that the policy should be aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular with Goal 1 (No Poverty) and Goal 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), and should contribute to numerous other goals, including Goal 2 (Ending Hunger), Goals 5 (Gender Equality), Goal 12 (Responsible Production and Consumption) and Goal 13 (Climate Change).
