MFSAC writes to President regarding SAITM

The Medical Faculty Students’ Action Committee (MFSAC) has written to President Maithripala Sirisena in connection with the efforts now being made to re-establish SAITM through a court procedure, the Convener of the Committee Didula Amarasinghe said.
Amarasinghe called on the Government to immediately declare the abolishing of SAITM in writing through a legal document and inform the same to the judiciary.
“Until then, the students will continue their struggle against SAITM and the selling free education,” he said.
He was speaking at a press conference yesterday.
“In the letter the committee mentioned that it would stand by doing justice for the SAITM students but is strongly opposed to using them to justify the Government's programme to sell free education while ignoring all proposals presented by Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), Faculty of Medicine Teachers’ Associations (FMTA), the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) and all anti SAITM organisations,” he added.
