Petition demanding General Election  handed over to MP Mahinda Rajapaksa

A part of a petition containing 5 million signatures of the public requesting a General Election was handed over to MP Mahinda Rajapaksa by the Chief Incumbent of Abhayaramaya, Narahenpita Ven. Muruththettuwe Ananda Thera of the Pevidi Hada (Voice of Clergy) Association yesterday afternoon.
Ven. Muruththettuwe Ananda Thera said that Sri Lanka is at a political crossroads today due to the prevailing crisis.
The Thera was speaking at a special function held at the Abhayaramaya in Narahenpita.
The Chief Incumbent said they have already taken further steps to hand over the said petition to the Commissioner of Elections and the Prime Minister’s Secretariat. It was also learnt that the said petition was signed with the intention of requesting a General Election to overcome the current political impasse and also to remove the non patriotic political leaders who are the bane of society.
The Thera said that the people in this country have now realised that the change they wished for in 2015 was a myth and they were taken for a ride by the previous Government.
“Today, this country is facing anarchy with no Prime Minister and a Cabinet. Therefore, the only solution for overcoming this dangerous situation is to call for a General Election,” Ven. Muruththettuwe Thera said.
“The Maha Sangha” always expects the people to take a wise decision by electing a sensitive and patriotic leader who will uphold the indigenous values and traditional values of the country. In this regard, the Maha Sanga, will always support and assist such a leader like former Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, who will protect Buddhism,” the Thera said.
