Cattle theft on the rise in Matale

There is an increase of cattle theft in the Matale district, dairy farmers say.
During the past few months, several cattle thefts have been reported from various parts of the district. Organised gangs are engaging in this racket with the assistance of certain villagers, dairy farmers said.
A few cattle thieves were taken into custody by police in the recent past from Dambulla, Galewela and Sigiriya. Dairy farmers suggest the police take immediate action to strengthen village security committees further. Then, cattle thefts could be minimised, they said.
