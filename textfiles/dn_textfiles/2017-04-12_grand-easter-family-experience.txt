With brunch, eggcelent chocolate goodies and a special high tea, everything is ready at Cinnamon Grand to unroll a hearty Easter repast for guests.
On April 15 and 16, the hotel’s Coffee Stop at the lobby level will display a selection of handcrafted chocolate eggs, a variety of themed-cupcakes and shape cakes along with hot cross buns. These delightful treats can be purchased to be given as gifts or have it in house; or for some self-indulgence or more from the list of special Easter beverages.
On Easter Sunday, The Taprobane restaurant will lay out an extensive spread with over 200 dishes to feast on! From smoked fish to pickled Easter eggs, salads and appetisers, homemade tureens, pates and delicacies, soups, breads to Arabic, Japanese, Indian, Sri Lankan and Far Eastern speciality corners, the buffet is bound to wow anyone! A live grill, wok, pasta an egg stations are also part of the offering, alongside a selection of mains featuring grilled and fried modha, lamb goulash, seafood casserole, braised chicken roulade, beef tenderloin, rabbit ragout, veal and more! The carvery section too will have pork, goose, lamb, chicken, pecking duck, meatloaf and fish. Added to these are the 35 varieties of desserts.
Parents may take a breather and leave the kids at the Cheers Kids Club if the choice of dining is the Cheers Pub Sunday Carvery brunch. Salads, platters, carvery that will present beef sirloin, oven roasted duck, chilli marinated crispy chicken winglets and roast lamb with accompaniments and dessert. P
