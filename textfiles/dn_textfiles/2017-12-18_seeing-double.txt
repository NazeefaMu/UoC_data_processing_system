Seeing double

Guests were left scratching their heads wondering if they had one too many glasses of champagne in this amazing double wedding in China.
That’s because they really were seeing double when identical 26-year-old twins Zheng Dashuang and Zheng Xiaoshuang walked their identical brides - 23-year-old twins Liang Jing and Liang Qing - down the aisle together.
Making matters more confusing, the couples even decided to wear matching outfits too.
The men opted for swish black suits, with white shirts, red bow ties and black baseball caps, while the brides chose identical white off the shoulder lace gowns.
They even made sure their hair was styled the same and wore red lipstick to match the grooms’ ties.
The families met around 10 years ago. And, after becoming friends it is believed their mothers started plotting to arrange this double event.
The wedding in Daqing, Heilongjiang province, took place on December 3. And although extremely rare, marriages like this - called quaternary marriages - do happen.
It means while each couple’s children would technically be considered first cousins, their DNA would be so similar as if they were genetic siblings. It would make it nearly impossible to tell who their biological parents are based on their DNA alone.
Lets just hope the newlyweds did not get mixed up on their honeymoon! Mirror
