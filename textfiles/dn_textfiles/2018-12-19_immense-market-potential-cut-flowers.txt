Immense market potential for cut flowers

The market potential for cut flowers is excellent both in Sri Lanka and abroad, but to tap this market, Sri Lanka needs to step up production.
Despite the fact that Anthurium is known as an excellent floriculture crop for commercial projects in Sri Lanka due to its tropical climate, at present, the growers are not able to meet even the local demand.
For an amateur, cultivation of Anthurium could be done with an initial investment of Rs. 9,000. From a few square yards, one can expand the project to have 1,000 plants in 5.8 perch. The starter program will cost Rs 9,000, for 20 plants and material. The starter program will yield a return between Rs.15, 000-Rs.18, 000 per month and the demand is ever increasing,” said Mahima Group of Companies Chairperson Yamika Gunawardena.
Mahima Group, which commenced operations in Sri Lanka in 2000, has come a long way since its inception in Sri Lanka whilst creating close to 100 direct and 100,000 indirect employment opportunities for Sri Lankans across the country.
In addition, Mahima Group has currently propagated over 100 types of Anthuriums. Furthermore, the company currently exports cut flowers mainly to Middle East countries and is currently looking to export flowers to Netherlands and Japan in the near future.
In order to popularize the cultivation of Anthuriums among Sri Lankans, particularly to empower rural women, Mahima Group has currently undertaken various initiatives to lend a helping hand to those who are interested in cultivating Anthuriums as a business venture. To this end, training programs are also conducted by Mahima Group with recommendations for bank loans when growers reach a certain level of proficiency.
More importantly, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka provides loan facilities at a concessionary rate for those who are willing to cultivate Anthuriums as a business venture. Furthermore, advice, training and materials will be made available by the Mahima Group of Companies.
“Anthurium flowers are among the best selling tropical flowers across the world mainly due to its heart- shaped flowers. But the shape of Anthurium flowers can be vary; they can be tulip shaped, ribbon shaped, cup shaped and so on,” Gunawardena said.
Anthurium flowers are long-lasting, and plants will take around six months to throw shoots and about nine months to flower. Also some varieties have various colors that are pink, orange or white, purple, black and so on. Anthuriums are mainly grown in two districts. Yet, the supply falls far short of the demand.
