New system to repatriate deceased abroad, conduct last rites

The Foreign Affairs Ministry has introduced a new system to submit documentation relating to Sri Lankans deceased abroad through Divisional Secretariats.
The Consular Affairs Division of the Foreign Affairs Ministry in coordination with the Home Affairs Ministry has introduced the new system through which relatives of Sri Lankans deceased abroad are allowed to submit identity documents, affidavits, and other documentation relating to the repatriation of human remains or conduct of last rites through Divisional Secretariats island-wide.
Secretary to the Home Affairs Ministry has already issued a circular instructing all Divisional Secretaries to extend required assistance for the effective implementation of the initiative.
So far, relatives of deceased person were required to submit such documents to the Consular Affairs Division to bring human remains to Sri Lanka, or to get authorisation to conduct last rites abroad. Under the new system, the relatives of the deceased could submit the documentation to the nearest Divisional Secretariat, which in turn would forward them to the Consular Affairs Division for appropriate action.
The new system allows relatives of deceased to have their required documentation processed at the nearest Divisional Secretariat without having the need to travel to the Consular Affairs Division in Colombo or the Regional Consular Office in Jaffna.
The general public in outstation areas would particularly benefit from the new arrangement and avoid the need for travelling long distances to Colombo or Jaffna at a time of bereavement as well as undue delays and expenditure.
The initiative is part of the endeavours of the Foreign Affairs Ministry to streamline, decentralise and improve consular service delivery to the public.
