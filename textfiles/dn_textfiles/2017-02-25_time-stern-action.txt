Time for stern action

Every time a boat overturns in rough seas and deaths occur, there is a public outcry for tighter regulations. The authorities too promise to do the same but over a period of time, everything is forgotten until the next tragedy occurs. But the latest incident, in which at least 15 people perished when their boat capsized while going on a pilgrimage in Katukurunda, has galvanized the public, the authorities and the media like never before.
The simple fact is that this was a tragedy waiting to happen due to the lackadaisical attitude towards existing maritime safety regulations. And it was an easily preventable one. An accident of this nature happens due to the cumulative effect of several mistakes that pile up on one another.
The first mistake was using a fishing boat for a pilgrimage. That should have been a strict no-no. As the name implies, fishing boats are built for one purpose and one purpose only – fishing - and can carry only around six persons. They do not have the facilities required of a normal passenger boat, such as seats and safety equipment, although even fishing boats are now mandated by law to carry lifejackets and flotation devices.
There is a ground-based analogy – normal private buses are theoretically not supposed to operate “special tours” on hire, because they lack the creature comforts and sometimes the passenger insurance. There are a number of companies that provide licensed tour buses for such trips, but they are more expensive. Most people thus opt for the former which is arguably cheaper, without knowing the advantages of hiring a tour bus.
The same goes for boat trips. There are leisure tour boat operators who generally fulfill all safety requirements, but fishing boats are cheaper and easier to get. This is where the analogy ends - unlike the road, the sea is terribly unforgiving if you do not know how to swim. Even if you know how to swim, the sea conditions at the time of capsizing could make you drown.
The second mistake was overloading. This boat had more than 40 passengers, whereas it could accommodate only around six. To get back to our first analogy, most buses are terribly overcrowded but the bus can somehow go on without a major accident if the driver is careful enough. But on the high seas, in a fishing boat, that equation literally goes out of the water. Overloading affects the very stability of the boat and is a recipe for disaster.
The third, is the apparent lack of safety gear on board the ill-fated boat. EVERY boat, fishing or leisure, must have lifejackets and bigger vessels must have at least one lifeboat. The regulation is already in place, but implementation seems to be a problem. Other safety devices must also be carried, including flotation devices, rescue ropes and communications equipment.
Lifejackets save lives, period. How many more tragedies should happen before we realise this? Again, coming back to a road analogy, motorists now buckle up almost automatically because they know that seat belts save lives. In the same way, people should be wise enough to don a life jacket as soon as they board a boat. If any boat operator says “no lifejackets”, just do not patronize his business and walk away. The Government should strictly enforce the lifejacket regulations at least now.
The authorities should also insist on the installation of stabilizers on every new large fishing or leisure vessel. They literally help boats to be on an even keel and survive formidable waves. It is a somewhat expensive solution, but it can make a boat ride much more stable.
Safety gear can only do so much, if the human element fails. There was an emotional angle to this boat ride, being a pilgrimage. But that is no reason to abandon safety precautions. Every traveller must know about safety precautions that should be followed in a boat ride. The media should also play a bigger role in raising awareness on maritime safety. The licences of all operators who fail to adhere to safety guidelines must be cancelled, as the Government has done in this particular case.
There are several places of worship around the coast that have to be reached by boat, including the famous St. Anthony’s Church in Kachchatheevu Island. The authorities should draw up plans to ensure the safety of pilgrims in consultation with the religious leaders, boat operators and the Police. The seaworthiness of these boats and their safety features must be inspected beforehand. If they come up short in terms of safety equipment, they should not be allowed on the highs seas. We can learn a few lessons from other countries that have similar events on how they ensure the passengers’ safety.
Accidents do happen despite the best of precautionary measures. It is vital to have a more organised search and rescue system around our coast to ensure that help is available fast if a maritime accident occurs. A holistic approach is needed to the whole issue, from regulations to rescue.
