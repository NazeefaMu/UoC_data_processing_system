‘Some GMOA office-bearers trying to topple Govt’

Some office-bearers of the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) have no discipline and their only wish is to topple the government,Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Rajitha Senaratne said.
He was speaking at the Nursing Diploma Certificate Awarding Ceremony for the 2012 at Temple Trees.
One thousand two hundred and twenty nurses obtained their diploma certificates at the ceremony. Minister Senaratne said that trade unions affiliated to the Health Ministry like to stage strikes.
“They hold the strikes and say that the strikes are successful,” Minister Senaratne said.
“They are putting the lives of the people at stake by doing so. They should resort to strike action only if discussions were not successful.But, these trade unions start with trade union action. Some office bearers of the GMOA do not like to hold discussions,” Minister Senaratne said.
He also said that strikes should not be the only means for trade unions. He added that although the government attempts to solve the issues in a diplomaric manner, certain trade unions act to the contrary. “No matter the issues created, this government cannot be toppled,” Minister Senaratne said.
“The government should take stern action against the GMOA. I am always of that view. They have received free education to become doctors,but, the actions of some doctors cannot be acceptable,”the Minister said.
The Minister said that when the Ministry said that disciplinary action would be taken against the medical staff, the trade unions threaten to resort to strike action.
“In the past, the strikes was staged to protect the free health service,but,currently strikes are held with other intentions,” Minister Senaratne said.
“During a discussion with the GMOA, the Health Services Director General had told them that he was working in accordance with the government regulations.”
The Minister said that the GMOA in response to Health Services Director General had said that they would see to it when they toppled the government after three years.
“We have to change the mentality of some of the GMOA office-bearers,” Minister Senaratne said.
“The Good Governance Government is not ready to be toppled. The government is committed to serving the people. Therefore, nobody can topple this government,”the Minister added.
