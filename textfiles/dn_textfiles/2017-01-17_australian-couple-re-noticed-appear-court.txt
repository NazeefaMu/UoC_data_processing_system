Australian couple re-noticed to appear in Court

Australian businessman Brian Shaddick and his wife were yesterday re-noticed to appear in Court on March 16 by the Colombo High Court to testify in connection with an indictment filed against Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader MP Udaya Gammanpila and another, accused for allegedly misappropriating Rs. 21 million following their alleged fraudulent share transaction that took place in 2000.
When the case came up before High Court Judge A.A.R. Heiyanthuduwa, it was fixed for trial on March 16 and two witnesses Brian Shaddick and his wife were re-noticed to appear in Court on the next date.
The Court ordered the Court registrar to dispatch the summons through the Foreign Affairs Ministry. The Court was informed that the witnesses had not been served the summons to appear in Court.
Meanwhile, first accused Udaya Gammanpila withdrew an application he had earlier made that he be allowed to travel to Kuwait.
Gammanpila and Sydney Jayasinghe are currently out on bail.
The Attorney General alleged that Gammanpila has cheated Rs. 20 million and misappropriated another Rs. 21 million along with Sydney Jayasinghe, the second accused when selling shares of Digital Nominees to a businessman called Dhammika Perera.
The Attorney General further charged that the alleged business transaction had taken place using a fraudulent power of attorney to sell shares belonging to Australian businessman Brian Shadick.
The Attorney General has listed 20 persons as the witnesses in the case and named 16 documents as production items in the case.
Gammanpila was arrested in this regard on June 18, 2016.
