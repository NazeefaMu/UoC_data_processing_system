‘Petroleum TUs have no right to strike over oil tanks’

The oil tanks at the Hambantota port are owned by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) and not by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC). Petroleum trade unions have no right to strike over oil tanks, United National Party (UNP) Kurunegala District MP Nalin Bandara said.
Addressing the media at Sirikotha, the UNP Headquarters yesterday, he said the goal of the petroleum trade union action is to disrupt, and create inconvenience to the Government.
Bandara said the trade union action is regulated by a political force to satisfy their narrow needs while causing disruptions to the economy.
He said, “the Government has no links with the attack on petroleum trade union members. The riot was controlled by Police and the Military forces.” He said the loss of the Hambantota port for 2016 was Rs. 47 billion. Measures should be taken to develop the port and to utilise it to create revenue for the country, he said.
“Sri Lanka acquires an ownership of 40.45 percent of the port under the 99 year lease out agreement with China,” he said.
Transport and Civil Aviation Deputy Minister Ashoka Abeysinghe also participated.
