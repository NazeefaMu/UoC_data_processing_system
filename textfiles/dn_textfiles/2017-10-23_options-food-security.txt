Options for food security

Agriculture plays a central and strategic role in Sri Lanka’s development. Indeed, it is the key to economic growth, increased incomes, improved living standards, poverty eradication, and enhanced food security. In fact, most of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have direct or indirect linkages to the agricultural sector in the country. The goal number two is to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.
The world food day fell on October 16 under the theme: “Change the future of migration. Invest in food security and rural development”. Still, 27.1 percent of labour force in the country is engaged in the agricultural sector.
The ratio of expenditure on food and drink to total expenditure is called food ratio. According to the Household Income and Expenditure Survey of Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) 2012/13, the average food ratio is 38 percent and this means an average household in Sri Lanka spends 38 percent for food of the total monthly expenditure. When considering the food ratio by sectors in the estate sector it is the highest as 49.8 percent, in rural sector 39.2 present and in urban sector 32.1 percent. This implies that a household in estate sector spends nearly 50 percent of its expenditure for food. The climate has changed rapidly and the country faced more extreme weather frequently during last few years than ever before. In 2014, both Maha and Yala seasons were affected by severe droughts prevailed throughout the year. After that, 2015 was a very satisfactory cropping year and both seasons performed well and ever highest paddy production of 4.8 Million Mt was recorded and a bumper harvest reached the markets. Again at the beginning of the 2015/16 Maha season flood damages were recorded.
The 2016 Yala season also was not quite satisfactory due to the flood situation prevailed at the beginning of the season. Now in 2017, the drought has taken it all during both Maha and Yala seasons. The lowest paddy production of 2.5 Million Mt was recorded in 2017, during the recent past in the country. Most of the other food crops production also declined sharply.
The delaying and insufficient monsoon rains severely affected the paddy and other field crop cultivations in most of the major producing areas in the country in both seasons in 2017. As a result of the above situation domestic prices of essential food commodities especially rice increased rapidly in the markets.
The price behaviour of most of the food commodities volatiles and reflects an increasing trend. The price of local Nadu rice in last week of September (Week 40) increased by 33% and 43% compared to the same period of 2016 and 2015 respectively. The rate of food inflation calculated by the DCS (Year to Year) recorded in January 2017 was 4.5 and it reached 10.4 in September and this was mainly due to the price pressure from rice, coconut, vegetables and onions. To stabilize the increasing food prices, the government, intervenes in various ways like promoting imports, import tax reductions, introducing food price ceilings, releasing government stocks to the markets, distributing food items at subsidized prices through government trading institutes like Cooperative Wholesale Establishment.
Impacts on food security
The above situation affects on the four dimensions of food security: food availability, food accessibility, food utilization and food system stability. Effects are already being felt in food markets, and are likely to be particularly significant in specific rural locations where crops fail and yields decline and urban locations where supply chains are disrupted and market prices increase. Most of the vulnerable people in the society are low-income consumers and small-scale farmers.
The availability of reliable data, statistics and information related to the four dimensions of food security and the adequate capacity to analyse the available information and good communication skills to inform decision-makers are the major determinants of food and nutritional security situation of a country. The data and information related to the Food availability: Domestic production, import capacity, Food stocks and Food aid comes under the availability.
The domestic production data comprises, cultivated land extent of major crops in each cropping seasons by Divisional secretary’s (DS) level, crop damages, average yield, total production, marketable surplus, major surplus and deficit areas. This needs an efficient data collection and a monitoring system at village level mainly due to the calculation of food surplus or deficit depend on those data.
Next, the data on domestic and commercial stocks by District or DS level and Government buffer stocks are important. Domestic stocks available at farmers, commercial stocks available at major manufacturers like rice millers and traders by district level need to be monitored frequently. Another is the availability of imported stocks and food aid given by various local and international agencies by province or district level.
Food access refers to the way in which different people obtain available food. Normally, food is accessed through a combination of home production, stocks, purchase, barter, borrowing, sharing, gifts from relatives, and provisions by welfare systems or food aid. Food access is ensured when communities and households and all individuals within them have adequate resources, such as money to obtain appropriate foods for a nutritious diet. Access mainly depends on income available to the household and price of food.
Market prices reflect the supply-demand situation of food commodities and therefore, accurate prices are the most important. Market margins, Value chain analysis of food commodities are other related types of information. The Hector Kobbekaduwa Agrarian Research and Training Institute (HARTI) is a famous body for collection and dissemination of food commodity prices in all major markets in the country. HARTI provides a detail description of weekly commodity price behaviour in the country and its disseminate daily vegetable prices in all dedicated economic centres through a Mobile service provider, Mobitel, on “6666” hotline as a public-private partnership.
Such price information is valuable for farmers for increasing their bargaining power with the traders and also finding better markets. In this process, a further need is monitoring the commodity prices by Divisional Secretariat level mainly to identify the food security situation in isolated rural areas like estate areas, especially during food shortage periods. Therefore, the collection, monitoring, analysing and presenting of food prices by grass root level are major important parts in food security.
Access to food
Stability of supply and access: It explains the variation of weather in main seasons, Commodity price fluctuations, economic and political factors cause stability of supply and access to food. Weather-related data are an important part and that valuable primary information is entirely collected by the Meteorological Department of Sri Lanka.
Commodity price data mainly collected by the Department of Census and Statistics, HARTI and Central Bank of Sri Lanka.
Food utilization mainly consists of Food Safety, Hygiene and manufacturing practices applied in primary agricultural production, harvesting and storage, food processing; transportation, and retail. Diet quality and diversity, meeting needs in terms of energy, macro- and micronutrients are the major concerns in food utilization. In this category, the post-harvest losses, practices of all actors from farmer to retail in food supply chains and factors contribute to quality deterioration are important. Food nutrition data are an integral part of food security and those data should be collected through research, demographic health and household surveys. This type of data and information is compiled by the Ministry of Health, Medical Research Institute, DCS and Universities.
When considering our country many actors hold information about the food and nutrition security situation. The integration of those actors and holistic approaches through this information should be the need to strengthening. Therefore, now is the most suitable time to establish a common framework to ensure coherence.
