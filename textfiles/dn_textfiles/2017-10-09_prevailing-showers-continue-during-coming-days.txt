The Meteorological Department predicted that the prevailing showers in the South-Western, Eastern and Uva provinces will continue during the next few days.
In its weather forecast, the Department said showers or thundershowers will occur in the Western, Sabaragamuwa, Central provinces, Galle, Matara and at several places in the North-Western and Northern provinces.
Showers or thundershowers will occur particularly in the Eastern and Uva provinces and the Vavuniya and Mullathivu districts after 2 pm today.
“Fairly heavy showers can be expected (about 50-75 mm) at some places in the Western, Sabaragamuwa and Central provinces and in the Galle and Matara districts. Fairly strong winds (40-50 kmph) can be expected in the Hambantota district,” it stated.
“There may be temporary, localized strong winds during thundershowers. General public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by lightning,” it added.
