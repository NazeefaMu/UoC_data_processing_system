The ICC has confirmed to Sri Lanka Cricket that fast bowler Shaminda Eranga who was reported for suspect action during the 2nd England Test, can be considered for selection to the 3rd Test at Lord’s on the 9th June.
Eranga is due to present himself for assessment at Laughborough on the 6th of June, and the ICC has confirmed that “Eranga is permitted to continue bowling in international cricket until the results of the testing are known” Meanwhile, National Selectors, headed by Sanath Jayasuriya have called up 29 year old left-arm-medium-fast bowler Chaminda Bandara to National duty following the lower back injury sustained by Dushmantha Chameera.
Bandara who’s 5 year career spans 51 First Class matches hauled an impressive 9/68 in the AIA Premier League Tournament against the Sri Lanka Army, and has 141 First Class wickets.
The old boy of St. Mary’s College – Kegalle is the only fast-bowler to feature among the top 15 wicket-takers of the AIA Premier League Tournament 2015/16.
Speaking on his selection, Chairman Selection Committee says; “Bandara has been performing well domestically and he is the best choice available at the time for the English conditions.”
Bandara will leave Sri Lanka together with Kusal Janith Perera, and both players are expected to be available for the 3rd Test.
