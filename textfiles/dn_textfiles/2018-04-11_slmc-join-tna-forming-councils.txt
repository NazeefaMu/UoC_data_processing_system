SLMC to join TNA in forming councils

The SLMC has reached an agreement with the TNA to obtain its support to set up administration in local councils in the East where the SLMC has failed to secure a majority of seats, SLMC leader Minister Rauf Hakeen said.
He was speaking to the media after a meeting with TNA leader R. Sambandan at his Trincomalee residence on April 9.
The minister said his party faced problems regarding the TNA when it tried to seek power in the Kuchchaveli Pradeshiya Sabha. They held discussions to overcome the problems and move forward.
The TNA agreed to give the Chairman’s post in the Muttur Pradeshiya Sabha to the SLMC and to take the Deputy Chairman’s post. The TNA also agreed to support the SLMC to set up administration in the Kinniya UC. This would not be restricted to Trincomalee only. They agreed to join hands in every council in which they could take control, he said.
