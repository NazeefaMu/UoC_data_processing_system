Spare the environment this Christmas - Cardinal

The special Christmas festival organised by the President’s House in Fort Colombo was held under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday.
Members of the Bishop’s Council led by Colombo Archbishop His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith participated.
The Cardinal highlighted the duty and responsibility of Christian devotees to protect and safeguard the environment which had a close link with the birth of Jesus Christ.
President Maithripala Sirisena said the government on its part was taking steps to perform its responsibility of safeguarding the environment according to a pre-arranged action plan.
He said it was everyone’s duty and responsibility to overcome present day environmental challenges for the well-being of man and all other living beings.
Singing of Christmas carols and several other events added colour to the Christmas festival. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and several other Ministers were also present.
