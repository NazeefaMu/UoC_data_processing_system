Army camps in the North should not be removed - Gammanpila

Army camps in the North should not be removed to resettle the displaced people in the North, Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Leader Udaya Gammanpila said.
He was joining in the adjournment motion moved by Opposition Leader R Sampanthan on problems faced by the people in the North and the East.
“We have no dispute on resettling the displaced people. It is a humanitarian issue. However, we do not agree to the argument of the Opposition Leader that these people must be resettled in their original lands by removing the Army camps. There are many unused lands in the North,” he said.
The MP said by the end of 2014, about 21,000 Army personnel had been removed from the North.
“Northern Province Chief Minister C V Wigneswaran had stated yesterday that the Army should be completely removed from the North. He has become a joker. What if all the other chief ministers in the country also request the same Where are we going to accommodate the Army” he said.
Commenting on why the military presence in the North is required, the MP said, “After the end of war about 12,000 ex-LTTE cadres had been released after rehabilitation. They can bear arms again and we have past experiences in that regard. So they must be under the Government's surveillance.
Many LTTE combatants fled during the final stage of war. They never surrendered. We still recover suicide kits and weapons in the North. The State apparatus had collapsed in the North during the period of war and those responsibilities were being carried out by the Army. Still, the Army has some contributions to be made in these state affairs,” he said.
