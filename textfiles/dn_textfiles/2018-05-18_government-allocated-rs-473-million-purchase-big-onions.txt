Government allocated Rs 47.3 million to purchase big onions

 
The government allocated Rs 47.3 million to purchase big onions at a certified price of Rs 80 per kilo, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
The Ministry plans to purchase 7000 metric tons of seed onion from the local farmers as relief for them considering the difficulties faced by most farmers since they cannot get a good price for their produce.    
According to the Minister, the Ministry has also taken measures to provide more relief for farmers, who are engaged in big onion farming.
The Ministry decided to provide a seed subsidy of Rs 9,000 per acre of land and an insurance cover worth Rs 40,000 and fertilizer subsidy for the big onion farmers.
