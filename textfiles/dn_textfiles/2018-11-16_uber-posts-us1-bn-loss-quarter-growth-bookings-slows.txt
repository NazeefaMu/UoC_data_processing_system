Uber posts US$1 bn loss in quarter as growth  in bookings slows

Uber Technologies Inc said on Wednesday (Nov 14) that growth in bookings for its ride-hailing and delivery services rose 6 per cent in the latest quarter, the third quarter in a row that growth has remained in the single digits after double-digit growth for all of last year.
The San Francisco-based firm lost US$1.07 billion for the three months ending Sep 30, a 20 per cent increase from the previous quarter but down 27 per cent from a year ago, when the company posted its biggest publicly reported quarterly loss on the heels of the departure of Uber co-founder and former Chief Executive Travis Kalanick.
Uber is seeking to expand in freight hauling, food delivery and electric bikes and scooters as growth in its now decade-old ride-hailing business dwindles.
The company, valued at US$76 billion, faces pressure to show it can still grow enough to become profitable and satisfy investors in an initial public offering planned for some time next year. Its adjusted loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization was US$592 million, down from US$614 million last quarter and US$1.02 billion a year ago.
