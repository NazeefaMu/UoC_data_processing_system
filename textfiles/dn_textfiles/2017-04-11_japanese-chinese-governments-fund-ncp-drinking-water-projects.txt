Japanese, Chinese Governments fund NCP drinking water projects

The Japanese and the Chinese governments are to fund a series of drinking water supply projects in the North Central Province to help prevent people from contracting kidney diseases.
The construction of the Anuradhapura North Water Supply Scheme is now in progress.
The Mahakanadarawa area where 150,000 people live will be provided with pipe-borne water by 2018. Kidney disease prone areas such as Rambewa, Mihinthale, and Madawachchiya will benefit by the installation.
The Japan International Corporation Agency provides Rs. 12,000m for the project.
Under the ‘Pibidemu Polonnaruwa’ programme, nine major water supply projects are proposed to provide clean water to nearly 490,000 people by 2020. The Chinese government will fund one of these water supply projects.
It will receive water from the Mahaweli river and the Aban Ganga The nine water schemes under Pibidemu Polonnaruwa will cost the government Rs. 6,000m.
One project will provide purified water to the Somawathi and Dimbulagala sacred area. It will cost the government Rs 540m.
