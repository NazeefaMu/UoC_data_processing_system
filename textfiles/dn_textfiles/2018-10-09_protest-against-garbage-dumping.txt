Protest against garbage dumping

The satyagraha in Puttalam against garbage dumping in Puttalam and Aruwakadu is continuing to its eighth day on Saturday.
Villagers at Puttalam 4th mile post and Veppamadu have gathered at Colombo Face in Puttalam in protest. Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka had proposed to dump garbage in the Aruwakadu area.
However, after being informed that this could harm wildlife, a new location for garbage dumping was identified at Serakuliya. Protestors say that if the minister can give priority to wildlife, he should give more consideration to people living in the newly proposed dumping area.
Meanwhile, on Friday, teachers from Puttalam gathered in protest also marking Teachers Day.
Chairman of the Puttalam Urban Council K. A. Baiz also attended.
On Friday, SLMC leader Minister Rauf Hakeem met the protestors and vowed to take action against this. However, the satyagraha is continuing.
