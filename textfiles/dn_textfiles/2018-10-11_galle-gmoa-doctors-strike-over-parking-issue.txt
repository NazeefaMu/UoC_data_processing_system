Galle GMOA doctors strike over parking issue

 
 
 
Doctors of the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) attached to the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital launched a token strike from 10.00 am to 4.00 pm yesterday owing to a vehicle parking issue.
The dispute between doctors and specialists over parking of their vehicles within the premises of the hospital had escalated, GMOA Karapitiya Branch Secretary Dr. Manjula De Silva told the media.
“We will refrain from performing our medical duties until a prompt assurance of the safety of doctors is given by hospital authorities,” he said.
He said that around 7.55 am yesterday, as a doctor had attempted to park his vehicle at the hospital vehicle park, a specialist with two of his colleagues had threatened the doctor not to park his vehicle there as it was reserved for specialists. However, the doctor had proceeded to park his car there and subsequently, the specialist had come close to the doctor, threatened him and forced him to take his vehicle out of the car park.
Thereafter, the doctor had parked his car at another spot and entered the hospital to complain about it to his trade union.
The GMOA doctors refrained from their normal medical duties other than emergency services.
Dr. De Silva told the media that they would complain about the incident to the police and report the case to the Hospital Director. If no satisfactory solution could be reached by today, they would extend their trade union action further until their parking problem was rectified.
The Hospital Director and his Deputy were not available for comment.
