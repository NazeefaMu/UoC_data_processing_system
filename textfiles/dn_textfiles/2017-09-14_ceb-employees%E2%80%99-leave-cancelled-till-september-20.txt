CEB employees’ leave cancelled till September 20

CEB employees’ leave have been cancelled from yesterday, 13, until September 20, the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) said.
The decision was taken after the CEB Workers’ Union announced that they would launch an indefinite strike from yesterday over several demands including the revision of their salary ratio from 1:6 to 1:9.
The CEB Workers’ Union said that they would continue the strike if they do not receive a favourable response by September 15.
<U+200B>They warned that no repair work will be carried in the case of a breakdown or power failure except at government hospitals during the strike.
CEB Engineers’ Association President Saumya Kumarawadu said the strike launched by the CEB Workers’ Union was baseless as the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry had given solutions to their demands.
He said that it was unfair for them to demand a salary equivalent to Executive Directors.
