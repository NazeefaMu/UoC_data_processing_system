More avenues left for government to collect taxes - Verité Research

A professional assessment of the opportunities for taxation in the country should reveal that there are other areas of taxation which the government could sustainably and reasonably collect money.
Verité Research Executive Director and Head of Research Dr. Nishan de Mel said the failure of Sri Lankan bureaucracy to professionally asses, calculate and calibrate taxes on cigarettes on an ongoing basis has caused a huge amount of financial losses.
Addressing a forum titled "Business Climate Outlook of 2016" organized by LBO-LBR he said there is a serious issue about how the public sector bureaucracy is functioning. "This is not only about politics, it is also about capacity and competence of Sri Lankan public sector. Issues relating to bureaucracy could be dealt with professional inputs, abilities required for a middle income economy.
Taking the case of cigarettes he pointed out that the collectible tax can increase by about Rs.50 billion as consumption of cigarettes continues to increase in all three quarters of 2015, despite the increase in excise tax.
He pointed out that the during the period 1981 to 2000, taxes on cigarettes have been adjusted in keeping with increasing per capita GDP.
Over the past 20 years, the government effectively maintained the habit of coming back, ensuring the total increasing excise taxes match the affordability or income growth in the country. According to him, from 2000 onwards, the bureaucratic system has failed to do the same. Dr. de Mel claimed that for 20 years what was affordable on per capita income was 9,542 cigarettes where as today per capita income can afford 15,831 cigarettes and this indicates there is more room to tax and increase the prices of cigarettes.
