Shapovalov fined $7,000 over umpire strike

London: Canada’s Denis Shapovalov has been fined for hitting the umpire with the ball during his country’s Davis Cup tie against Great Britain, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) announced on Monday.
Shapovalov, 17, was disqualified after striking chair umpire Arnaud Gabas in the eye with the ball in Ottawa on Sunday, gifting singles opponent Kyle Edmund a victory that gave Britain a 3-2 win.
The ITF fined Shapovalov $7,000 (6,520 euros), rather than the maximum $10,000, after accepting he had not intentionally struck Gabas after smacking a ball off the court in frustration at losing a point.
In a statement published on his Twitter account before the fine was announced, Shapovalov wrote: “There is no excuse for this behaviour and I take full responsibility for my action. AFP
