Moragahakanda project, Rajagiriya flyover commissioned today

The Moragahakanda Kalu Ganga multi-purpose development project and the Rajagiriya flyover project, are to be commissioned today to mark the three-year anniversary of the unity government since President Maithripala Sirisena won the 2015 Presidential Election.
In addition to the the vast changes that the unity government brought about since President Maithripala Sirisena's victory, including democratic independence, fairness, and a fear and suspicion-free environment, these projects would be commissioned today, while the Ganemulla and Polgahawela flyover projects would be commissioned on January 11 and January 17, respectively.
The national ceremony organised today to mark the commissioning of the Moragahakanda reservoir, which is four times bigger than the Parakrama Samudraya in Polonnaruwa, would be attended by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as the chief guests. The President would release water from the reservoir at the auspicious time of 11.20 am.
With the commissioning of this project, an increase of 64,000,000 cubic metres of water would flow from the reservoir to far-flung regions, including Vanni, Matale, Anuradhapura, Trincomalee, and Polonnaruwa, to support agricultural needs in an area of at least 81,422 hectares. This would increase rice production by 81 percent (109,000 tonnes), amounting to an estimated monetary benefit of US$ 1.67 million, annually. In addition to the irrigation of land, water from the same reservoir would be used to power the 25-Megawatt Moragahakanda hydroelectric power station.
The Rajagiriya flyover, which opens today, would increase the driving speed along Parliament Road from 2 kmph to 16 kmph, bringing a long-term solution for the heavy traffic congestion in the area.
The flyover, comprising of four lanes, is 533 metres in length and 21.4 metres in width. Several roads leading to Rajagiriya would also be developed as a part of the project, while an alternative road towards Narahenpita would also be developed in due course.
The road towards Buthgamuwa is in the agenda to be developed with three lanes. The 504-metre long Ganemulla flyover, which was constructed at cost Rs 1.768 million, would resolve the longstanding traffic congestion in the town, which is caused by the closure of the rail gates as frequently as 90 times per day. Around 87 trains travelling to and from Colombo, Badulla, Kandy, Jaffna, Trincomolee, Mannar, and Batticaloa, pass the Ganemulla railway station, resulting in the excessive closure of the of its rail gates.
The 883 metre-long Polgahawela flyover, which is built at a cost Rs. 2.203 million, would be opened on January 17.
It would greatly benefit the Polgahawela - Kegalle (A 19) road users.
The town is the entry point to a number of cities, including Kegalle, Rambukkana, and Narammala. It comprises a two-lane carriageway and two pedestrian ways on either side.
