Bizarre ruses and work-cut excuses!

Welcome to my world, the world of the printed word and also the unprintable ones at times. This is about life in the newsrooms both here and overseas. My column is dedicated to all those legendary hacks in the many newsrooms I have worked in disparate parts of the world.
I have encountered them all, including the conscientious ones who would faithfully come in to work even when running raging temperatures. On the other hand there are those who cry off work at the drop of a mild sneeze. Whether it’s just plain laziness, a hangover, or a sense of entitlement, many journalists conjure up a flurry of implausible excuses to take a day off.
The line between work and home time is blurred for most journalists. That is because newspaper shifts are by no means usual. Many in the fraternity who work graveyard shifts start working when normal civilized people are about to go to bed and head for home when others are waking up. Some of these night owls and dawn twilight workers are masters of the art and can spin a plausible yarn that would bring tears to the eyes of the most hard-bitten cynical editors. That is because in the sorority of wordsmiths, as in any profession, there are liars, damned liars and experts. That got me thinking as to define who actually is an expert?
Calling in to tell your editor or desk head that you cannot come into work for the day can be a touchy issue. If you are planning to take a day off, in most instances you will need a darn good excuse for missing work or risk causing problematic issues, or perhaps some tension at the job for your colleagues.
Here is a great falsification that works every time, if you have false teeth that is. It was used consistently by an old sub-editor nicknamed ‘Paul Pachaya’ who got away with it at least a half dozen times. His stock excuse: “I dropped and broke my dentures.” And then there was old ‘Pottay Peter’ whose bad eyesight constrained him to wear thick bottle-lens glasses. His run of the mill explanation was: “I have misplaced my glasses and can’t find them until I find them!”
And who can forget ‘Dead-Bull Douglas’ a photographer who claimed he had cut his foot every time he had to cover a wedding in his private capacity. The rascal returned to the office late or on the following day with an exaggerated limp. To make the excuse stick he put a pebble in his shoe that reminded him to walk gingerly because of the ‘stitches’. It worked like a charm until a hawk-eyed news editor caught him both literally and figuratively on the wrong foot. In the course of the day he had transferred the pebble to his other shoe.
Journalistic executives are usually liberal and understanding with leave unlike those in different professions who are more stringent and do not want employees taking off unless the situation truly warrants a leave of absence. This issue is one of the oldest conflicts in business and has been a problem since the first days of capitalism. The experts usually decide on a reasonable illness, such as a migraine headache or food poisoning.
The liars and damned liars come up with what the bosses call the ‘mother of all excuses’ such as someone in your family dying. A death in the family excuse, if a damnable lie, is questionable for moral reasons. If it is true, then it is not an excuse, it is a reason someone would not show up for work. When you lie about having a death in the family, it can actually come back to bite you if you are not prepared to show proof of the death.
One proofreader in Hong Kong is reputed to have attended his mother’s funeral at least six or seven times. It is true that the family matriarch had actually died. But the sad event had occurred some fifteen years before his prolonged period of mourning. Most accommodating editors are liberal with hangover excuses, because they too have suffered the ravages of the morning after at some time or another.
The trick is not to get caught up in a lie. The truth, sometimes with a bit of liberally-laced humour works better. In my long and varied career as a managing editor and editor-in-chief I have come across some of the most bizarre excuses imaginable. For instance a women’s page sub-editor once called and explained to me: “I am not coming in because I tried to dye my hair black, but it came out green! The only thing missing is my mode of transportation, a broomstick.” Naturally I excused the witty witch.
Another hard-working feature writer who had not been spared the amorous arrows of Cupid’s compulsively mischievous bowstring and had been drinking heavily to drown his disappointment called in to say that he was indisposed. Aware of his one-sided infatuation I asked what his sickness entailed. He said without preamble: “Liver function is normal. But the lab test indicated abnormal lover function.”
A junior reporter once called in and offered this excuse: “I am very close to the office but a car drove by and splashed an entire puddle over me.” The news editor told her if she was close to the office to come in anyway. She did and she entered the office with her clothes spattered with mud.
The disbelieving news editor offered her office transport to go home shower and change.
A broadminded, sympathetic editor who indulgently granted a lying rapscallion journalist a week’s leave to attend his father’s funeral realised later he had been taken for a ride. When the deceitful reporter returned after completing his sympathy leave he was confronted by his usually tolerant boss. The editor shook his hand, sympathized and asked: “Do you believe in life after death?” The liar responded without batting an eyelash: “Yes chief, I certainly do!”
Eyes blazing the editor fired back: “I thought you would. That is because never since the miracle of Lazarus did the spectacle of a dead man arising from the grave inspire such spontaneously robust faith among your colleagues.”
The fraud completely flummoxed retorted: “But, but Chief what are you talking about?” The editor shot him a withering look and fired: “After you left to attend your father’s funeral, he stopped by the office to see you.”
