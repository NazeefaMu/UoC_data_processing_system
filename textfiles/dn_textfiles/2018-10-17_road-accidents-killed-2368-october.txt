Careless driving, drunk driving and unruly private buses, the main reasons :
Road accidents killed 2,368 up to October

Road accidents had caused 2,368 deaths by October this year, Law and Order Deputy Minister Nalin Bandara Jayamaha yesterday revealed.
This is nearly eight deaths per day on average on the roads. “I hope society will be sensitive to this revelation. If you take the very recent records, there were nine deaths due to road accidents yesterday, six day before yesterday and ten more in the previous day.
This is a serious issue. We need to create a social discourse to analyse this matter and find solutions.We cannot do this alone,” Deputy Minister Bandara said.
He said during the last seven years, from 2012 to 2018, 18,491 deaths were caused by road accidents.
Bandara said the government, together with Sri Lanka Police, will create a special team and a programme to bring down these numbers.
He urged the public, social activists, civil society, media and all responsible parties to contribute to this task.
According to the Deputy Minister, in the years 2017, 2016 and 2015, the recorded number of deaths caused by road accidents amounts to 3100, 2961, and 2816 respectively. Bandara observed that road accidents are relatively low in Expressways compared to other main roads.
Careless driving, drink driving and unruly private buses are the main reasons behind these high road accidents. Bandara pointed out that 722 pedestrians, 778 motorcyclists, 153 pillions, 189 drivers and 333 passengers had died in accidents this year.
“You have to understand that these deaths have a ripple effect on the victims’ families. Most of the time, the victims happened to be the breadwinner of the family. So, these victims’ families are thrown into poverty among other difficult situations.
I hope everyone will see the importance of putting a stop to this condition,” Bandara furthered.
