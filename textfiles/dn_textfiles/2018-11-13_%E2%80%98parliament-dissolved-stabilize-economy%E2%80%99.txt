‘Parliament dissolved to stabilize economy’

President Maithripala Sirisena dissolved Parliament to protect the country from economic instability. Parliament was dissolved to obtain a strong mandate of the people to form a new government, said City Planning and Water Supply Minister M. L. A. M. Hisbullah.
He was addressing the gathering at the felicitation ceremony organised by Maha Group to honour social workers at Hisbullah Hall in Kattankudy on Saturday.
"No one is safe in an economic crisis. Sovereignty, economy and defence would be at stake. The President urged Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and former Minister Sajith Premadasa to take over the Premiership. But, they refused. Then the SLFP was contemplating on appointing Minister Nimal Sirpala de Silva as Prime Minister.
Finally, considering the economic instability, the President took the decision to appoint former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister.
The new Prime Minister was appointed in keeping with the Constitution.
If the appointment of Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa was unconstitutional, the UNP and others could go to court seeking justice. They did not go to court because they have no provisions in the Constitution, said Minister Hisbullah. The ceremony themed, ‘Let's felicitate the people alive’ was held under the patronage of Mumtaz Mathani, Secretary of Hira Foundation.
