KOICA supports flood-affected

The staff and volunteers of the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) Sri Lanka Office volunteered at Mapalagama Central College in Nagoda, Galle District, in support of the flood-affected people in the area.
This was in cooperation with the Nagoda Divisional Secretariat and the college on June 24.
Negoda is one of the areas severely affected by the recent floods and landslides. The staff and volunteers cleaned and re-painted the educational compound and handed over school supplies and books to the students of the school where the library was flooded. The volunteer work was conducted as the 4th ‘Yamu Yamu’ (Let’s Go) activity.
The KOICA Sri Lanka Office organize the ‘Yamu Yamu’ activities on a regular basis; group exercises and games were arranged for local children and students especially from marginalized backgrounds. A pillar of KOICA’s volunteer programme is to promote socio-economic development at the grassroots level.
Currently, about 80 KOICA volunteers are engaged in voluntary work in many parts of Sri Lanka where the local need of expertise, knowledge and experience arises, in the fields of Korean language teaching, computer education, social welfare, etc.
