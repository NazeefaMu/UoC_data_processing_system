Santa... who are you?

With Christmas around the corner it is no surprise that sights of a jolly old man, dressed in red and white, are growing in frequency and with it mounts the excitement and anticipation of children all around the world. All are familiar with the man clad in red and white, whose laughter resonates far and wide. A symbol of Christmas and the reason as to why children are impeccably well behaved during the month of December, he is a welcome sight to all yet few are really aware of the origins of Santa Claus.
St. Nicholas
The most well-known ancestor of the modern day Santa Claus is St. Nicholas, born around the year 280AD in Turkey who is commemorated on December 6, the day considered the anniversary of his death. Differing from the jolly round Santa that we know today, St. Nicholas was a fiery defender of the Christian doctrine and a bishop in the town of Myra. He inherited the fortunes of the family as his parents passed away when he was quite young. Known to be a kind hearted and pious man, there are many tales of how the young bishop used his wealth to assist the poor and those in need.
The tradition of hanging up stockings for Santa to fill and his use of the chimney originated with the most famous tale associated with St. Nicholas. It tells of a poor man who had three daughters for whom he could not afford dowries and therefore couldn’t get them married. St. Nicholas having heard of his plight dropped a bag of gold into the poor man’s house via the chimney. It landed in a stocking that was drying by the fireplace. The poor man was able to marry off his first daughter. The same process was repeated for his second daughter and for the next few nights the poor man lay awake by the chimney to find out who had been helping him. He caught St. Nicholas dropping another bag of money down the chimney for his third daughter. In spite of St. Nicholas requesting his silence, word spread about the kind St. Nicholas.This was the basis of the tales of Santa’s descent down chimneys to fill stockings for inhabitants of each household.
St. Nicholas’ popularity spread and he became known as the protector of children. A tale that led to this tells of how St. Nicholas had entered an inn in Athens and sensed the crime of the innkeeper who had just murdered three boys, dismembered their bodies and pickled them in basement barrels. The bishop not only sensed the crime but through his fervent faith and divine senses, resurrected the boys thus earning him the title of patron saint of children.
The Protestant Reformation resulted in many saints including St. Nicholas falling out of favour in most of Northern Europe.
Sinter Klaas
Even after the Protestant Reformation when the veneration of saints was discouraged, St. Nicholas was able to maintain a positive reputation in the Netherlands. Dutch settlers took the legends of Saint Nicholas, known to them as Sinter Klaas, to America towards the end of the 18th century. Sinter Klaas was believed to have ridden a white horse and left gifts in wooden shoes the day before St. Nicholas’ Day. Festivities take place on December 5 and 6 in the Netherlands and in Belgium. Gradually instead of giving gifts on December 6, he became a part of the Christmas holiday and tradition by giving gifts on Christmas Eve.
Christkind
As mentioned before, the Protestant Reformation resulted in the disappearance of saints such as St. Nicholas however someone still had to deliver gifts to children on Christmas Eve to reward them for being good. Thus came about the Christkind who originated in Protestant faith as the idea of a Catholic saint bringing Protestant children their gifts was rejected as was the veneration of saints. The Christkind or Kris Kringle was chiefly popular in countries such as Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Liechtenstein, Slovakia and Switzerland.
The Christkind is depicted as an angelic figure with blond hair and wings and, as implied by the translation of its name, is symbolic of the Christ Child. The Christkind brings gifts on Christmas Eve and leaves them under the tree and his arrival or departure is usually signified by the ringing of a bell.
Over the years Christkind transformed from the Baby Jesus representation into a blonde, female angel. Each year in the city of Nürnberg in Germany since 1969, a teenage girl is chosen to depict the Christkind and is known as the ‘Nürnberger Christkind’. Similar to present day Santa Claus, she also is flocked by children who sit on her lap and tell her what they want for Christmas.
Many countries though not visited by good old St. Nick make ready their homes to receive other Christmas personas. Scandinavia receives “Jultomten”, an elf in a sleigh drawn by goats. “Pere Noel” is known to visit France and fill the shoes of children with treats and candy. Italy is home to the good witch, “La Befana” who rides her broomstick down the chimney and fills the stockings left by little children. On January 5, it is believed that an elderly woman by the name of “Babouschka” leaves gifts at the bedsides of little Russian children to make amends for giving the wise men incorrect directions to Bethlehem. It is believed that in doing so she may earn the forgiveness of Baby Jesus.
The Image of Santa Claus
Santa Claus was revived by a series of authors and poets in the 19th century and it was during this time that the image of Santa that we are familiar with came to life. “Knickerbocker’s History of New York” written by Washington Irving in 1809 first depicted a pipe-smoking Nicholas soaring over the rooftops in a flying wagon, delivering presents to the well behaved children.
In 1821 a booklet entitled “The Children’s Friend” was supposedly written by Arthur J. Stansbury and it contained the first known visual representation of Santa and his sleigh drawn by a single reindeer. The poem describes Santa as “a steady friend of virtuous youth” who brings gifts and candies to little boys and girls.
In 1822, “A visit from St. Nicholas” more popularly known as “The Night before Christmas” written by Clement Clarke Moore tells of the plump, jolly Santa and his eight reindeer – Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner and Blitzen. Rudolph was created over a century later in 1939 by Robert L. May, whose story poem had a similar rhyme scheme to that of Moore’s “The Night before Christmas”.
The image of Santa wasn’t the full-size adult, dressed in red with white fur trim, who resided in the North Pole with a reindeer-driven sleigh until the late 19th century.
The jolly, chubby, grandfatherly face of this Santa was largely created by Thomas Nast who also based his design on the works of Clement Moore. His work as well as the works of N. C. Wyeth, J. C. Leyendecker, Norman Rockwell and other popular illustrators contributed to the Santa Claus we know and love today.
Where is Santa Claus now?
Santa Claus has since been commodified with his representation in Coca Cola advertisements. He appeared on billboards, counters, advertisements of all shapes and sizes to convince the public that Coke was the solution to “the thirst for all seasons”.
Nowadays Santa appears to frequent the streets of Colombo, sometimes even in more than one place at the same time to deliver the magic of Christmas to children everywhere. From little roadside shops, to boutiques to large scale stores, Santa is everywhere and occasionally has a few sweets for the little boys and girls that venture inside the stores with patient parents in tow.
A symbol of Christmas, it is hard to imagine that the magical Father Christmas was originally just old St. Nick from the little town of Myra. Encompassing the essence of Christmas as a time for giving rather than getting, a time for helping one’s neighbours and cultivating the spirit of generosity and kindness, the origins of Santa Claus should not be forgotten.
