Deadly disease at Karapitiya hospital identified

The unidentified disease at the Galle, Karapitiya Teaching hospital has been identified to be a serious strain of pneumonia with the disease fast spreading in the Southern Province, Karapitiya Teaching Hospital, Galle Paediatrician Dr.Aruna de Silva said yesterday.
When the Daily News further inquired further about the disease, he explained that in the past few months, there was some prevalence of the disease, but, the situation had become worse now.
“Patients from Matara, Hambantota and Tangalle have started to come here. In addition to our own children’s ward, children’s wards at hospitals in the area are also full. The most affected are children between the ages of 2-3 years.This disease is very potent to the child,” Dr.de Silva said.
“When investigating the root causes of the disease, the doctors working on this agree that this is not pneumonia which comes from a virus,but, pneumonia which has come as a result of Influenza and Adenoviruses. Both adults and children are susceptible to it. It can be deadly in children below two years,” Dr.de Silva added.
He said the best cure was prevention and to keep healthy children away from it. If children who have caught the disease have siblings, it is advised that they not visit the sick child in hospital. Parents in turn have been asked not to attend weddings,funerals or areas where people congregate.
“If you child has a cold, cough or fever, it is best that he/she is kept at home and not sent to school. This would help safeguard healthy children and reduce the number infected,” he furthr said.
“If healthy people come to hospital to visit sick children,they are likely to get sick too. Therefore, we are working with the Hospital Director to control visitor numbers. We have also suggested that all staff and parents enter the area wearing masks. Arrangements have also been made to provide soap and sanitisers for people to wash after visiting patients,” Dr.de Silva said.
He also believes that if the basic conditions above were followed, they would be able to contain the spread of the disease. Further, if children display symptoms of high fever, cough, diarrhoea, it has been recommended that they seek immediate medical attention.
