No positive investments  for North yet - Chief Minister

No positive investments have taken place in the North East and the flow of cash to the region is inadequate, lamented Chief Minister of Northern Provincial Council, C. V. Wigneswaran.
Speaking at the inauguration ceremony of the 9th edition of the Jaffna International Trade Fair (JITF) he said that this may be because the process of reconsolidation also still not completed and a political solution not offered. “Till a permanent political solution is brought about investment would not come to the North,” he cautioned.
Wigneswaran said that in contrast to here, as soon as the conflict in South Africa ended it was followed by a permanent political solution and the investors in the world acknowledged it and went there.
Commenting further he said that though the A9 road was re built the other roads leading to the A9 were not renovated. “Due to this situation the benefits one could derive of the A9 has become limited.”

The Chief Minister also said that no development is taking place at the Palali regional airport which can be easily converted to an international airport. The government has shown no interest in giving approval for it, he alledged.
Wigneswaran said the Board of Investment office in Jaffna too has been lethargic in wooing more investments to the Jaffna peninsula.
The Chief Minister said that as a solution to the Polythene issue Jaffna based entrepreneurs have come up with a solution to it. “These entrepreneurs will soon introduce packaging material made out of plantain and Palmyra leaves as a substitute and this material would be available in the market soon.”
Minister of Primary Industries, Daya Gamage speaking at the event appreciated the efforts by the Northern people to uplift their lives, and said his Primary Industries Ministry has made many plans to develop Jaffna and other districts in the province.
“State mediation is insufficient, and the state officials should assist in getting private sector contributions towards that end,” he said.
Meanwhile, A Natarajan, Consul General, Consulate General of India, Jaffna Sri Lanka too said that even though business delegations from India visit JITF they do not invest in Sri Lanka.
He said that in contrast the Indian government is assisting the development of Jaffna since 2010 and will invest US$ 45 million to upgrade the KKS harbour. “In addition one of the best cultural center in the island is being built adjoining the Jaffna library with Indian aid amounting to Rs. 2 billion. The foundation for this was laid by Indian premier Narendra Modi in 2015.”
He also said that the Indian government is further investing Rs. 300 million for rain water harvesting projects to assist Agri farmers.
