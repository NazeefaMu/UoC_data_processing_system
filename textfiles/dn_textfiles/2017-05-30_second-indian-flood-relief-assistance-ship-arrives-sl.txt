Second Indian flood relief assistance ship arrives in SL

As part of India’s continued commitment to assist in flood relief efforts in Sri Lanka in response to a request from the Sri Lankan Government, INS Shardul arrived in Colombo on Sunday. It was carrying nearly 200 personnel on board, including specialized rescue, diving and medical teams, as well as a large amount of relief material and Gemini inflatable boats. This was the second Indian Naval ship to reach Colombo to provide assistance, after INS Kirch reached Colombo on May 27.
Indian High Commissioner Taranjit Sandhu, while handing over the supplies to Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake, and Acting Minister of Disaster Management Dunesh Gankanda, reiterated India’s steadfast commitment to extend all possible assistance to Sri Lanka. The Foreign Minister thanked the Indian Government for providing assistance within hours of a request being made.
Both Ministers also took a tour of the ship, and were briefed about the advanced equipment and facilities on board for disaster relief. The 40 tons of relief material on board INS Shardul were as per the requirement conveyed by Sri Lankan authorities, such as rice, atta (flour), dal, sugar, bed sheets, blankets, durries, rain coats, milk, biscuits, etc. The rescue, diving and medical teams on board will work in coordination with the Sri Lanka Navy and other authorities, and are now being deployed in the worst affected areas, particularly Ratnapura and Horana, as per requirements identified by Sri Lankan.
A third Indian Naval Ship, INS Jalashwa, with additional relief material, is expected to reach Colombo shortly.
