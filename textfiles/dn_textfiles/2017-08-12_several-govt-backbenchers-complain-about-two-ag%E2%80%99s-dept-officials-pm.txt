Several Govt. backbenchers complain about two AG’s Dept. officials to PM

Several government backbenchers met Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Thursday to complain against the actions of two senior officials of the Attorney General’s Department working for the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into the Treasury Bond issue. The MPs had elaborated on overall actions taken by the Attorney General’s Department and had in detail pointed out to certain misgivings and practices of the two senior officers.
The discussions between the ruling party MPs and the Prime Minister took place at the Parliament Complex.
Furthermore, they submitted a letter to the Prime Minister’s office yesterday (11) asking that the Prime Minister reveal the government’s stance with regard to these two senior officers.
During their discussions, the MPs had presented documents to the PM showing that one of the senior officers was drawing a salary at the Department while also being paid another salary as consultancy fees to the Central Bank during the tenure of the previous regime.
They also informed the Prime Minister that this officer tried to use his influence in the AG’s Department to suppress evidence in a rape case in an organised manner.
The other senior official they say had acted in a suspicious manner in the case connected to the Tsunami money fraud.
