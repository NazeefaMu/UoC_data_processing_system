Between aroma and serenity

Canvases of brilliant colour, masterful strokes and thought-provoking design meet the eye, as you walk into a house of art, carefully curated by the artist himself, Dimuthu Kumarasinghe.
Well known in the hospitality industry as a chef par excellence, given the Culinary World Cup wins and the multitude of awards that is reserved under his name, Chef Dimuthu Kumarasinghe (fondly known as DK) made his maiden voyage in to the world of art, away from the kitchen table and on to a canvas, with the opening of ‘The Art Gallery by Chef Dimuthu’ recently.
Warmth and peace
Located in Nalluruwa, Panadura, the gallery boasts of a diverse range of art, from those on canvas to creative moulding of wire and steel, and to intricate wooden art. Each of his creations is unique and are thought-provoking with a subtle undertone of serenity that gives viewers a feeling of instant warmth and peace.
A self-taught painter (as he is a culinary whiz), Chef Dimuthu’s inaugural collection features an array of art that he has accumulated over time. Having considered this a hobby, his paintings lies in the homes of many around the globe which has been gifted by him or picked from his home while visiting him. The interest and enthusiasm for his creations are what propelled Chef Dimuthu to finally open his own space, where one can embrace the colours and pick their favourites for purchase.
Among Chef Dimuthu’s illustrious career – which has brought him to his current position as General Manager Group Skill Development Chef and Culinary Brand Ambassador at Aitken Spence Hotels – is his multiple wins at Culinary World Cup and receiving the acclamation as the only participant to receive nine gold medals at individual categories at Culinary World Cup within two years. Chef also holds the title for creating the world’s most expensive edible cake (supported by Aitken Spence Hotels) and the world record for creating the world’s smallest wedding cake in 2015. These deem worthy of a title as a scientist of art, given his prowess in the fields of innovative creation and mesmerising design, no matter the medium he works with.
Culinary capacity
He is a Presidential Award Winner and has been the President of Chefs Guild of Lanka since 2012. He has also been appointed as a Jury Member in numerous international culinary competitions and has received an honorary life membership in over seven culinary associations in the world. A humble human being, Chef Dimuthu has been keen to disseminate the knowledge he has acquired through the years and mentor many aspiring chefs both here and abroad.
The opening saw the presence of veterans in the culinary field to the likes of Gerard Mendis and Chef Pubilis.
