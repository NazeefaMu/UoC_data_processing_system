Beauty hacks to get that  perfect selfie

When it comes to social media, everyone’s Facebook and Instagram is flooded selfies as you scroll down the feed. And, if you still haven’t mastered the art of clicking selfies, then we’re here to help. A lot of times your make-up looks good in real life, while your photos look the opposite. Here are 8 tips that will help you to get the perfect shot:
 Skip SPF
If you have applied sunscreen or any product which has SPF in it, it can ruin your photos with flash. So, avoid photos with flash during the day and skip SPF cream during the night for flash photos.Like the way sunscreen reflects the UV rays, it will also reflect the flash night, ruining your photos.
The angle matters
To get the perfect selfie and avoid the double chin, always elevate the phone while clicking a photo. Angle the phone camera with your forehead to get the perfect selfie!
Get the perfect smile
While getting clicked, make sure you don’t over smile, it can show lines on the face and even make your eyes look small. You can try the hack of sticking your tongue behind your teeth and gums won’t show too much!
Check your foundation
A lot of times a wrong shade of foundation can ruin your photograph. Look for a foundation that matches your skin tone just perfectly. You can test the colour by clicking a selfie and and seeing if the shade is perfect.
Avoid greasy hair
Oily hair can ruin your photo unless you turn it into a slicked back hairdo. If you haven’t washed your hair, you can spray a little bit of dry shampoo to give your roots a little volume at the front.
Apply some blush
Sometimes your face can look too flat in the photos. A little blush can help you look youthful and even glow in the photos!
Don’t blink too much!
If you blink too much in photos, close your eyes before the photo is clicked for a few seconds. This hack will avoid too much blinking.
Just apply one bold colour
If you have applied one bold colour like your lips, avoid too much colour on your eyes. Stick to one bold colour in your face.
