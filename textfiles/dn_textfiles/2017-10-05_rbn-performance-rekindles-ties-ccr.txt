RBN Performance rekindles ties with CCR

RBN Performance, a sports specialized garment manufacturer strengthened its partnership with Colombo City Running (CCR), a popular community-based recreational running group by introducing their latest running specialized sports wear during a ceremony at the Renuka City hotel, Colombo recently.
CCR was founded in 2015 by Omar Alif, who sought a community with which to share his passion for running. In a little over two years, CCR has evolved into a team that goes beyond recreational running with most members preparing to participate in competitive marathons and other fitness competitions both in Sri Lanka as well as in abroad. With the vision of promoting and improving running in Colombo, CCR is a non profitable organization with voluntary participation. There is no monetary commitment from members, and participation in CCR is open to novices as well as seasoned athletes.
RBN Performance, one of Sri Lanka’s leading apparel manufacturers first partnered with CCR in 2016 and has extended their support to CCR as the community’s apparel partner. CCR runners will sport RBN Performance apparel as they represent the community in local and international competitions, as well as in regular CCR runs. “We are delighted to rekindle our association with CCR and support them in their efforts to promote fitness and healthy living, both of which are synonymous with the values of RBN Performance,” said Business Head, RBN Performance, Dhananjaya Weerakoon.
RBN is Sri Lanka’s first performance wear brand for men and women, built with the Sri Lankan athlete in mind. Sri Lanka is currently undergoing a fitness revolution, and RBN has been at the forefront in purpose designing and engineering a range of performance garments that suit local climate and user conditions, combining both style and performance for athletes at all levels.
“The brand’s core competency is its strength from design, material engineering and technical capabilities, and we specialize as a product development hub for manufacturing technical garments,” said Weerakoon. RBN’s apparel is powered by ‘Sportech’, the brand’s own moisture management and anti-bacterial platform. RBN has further provided specific performance factors, such as compression for athletes with demanding performance needs. RBN’s products are specifically engineered for Sri Lanka and Sri Lankans, while maintaining world class product development and manufacturing standards.
“At present CCR’s membership comprises 340+ individuals, of which the vast majority are from Colombo. Every CCR run comprises of a routine of pre-run warm-up and dynamic stretches, and post run cool-down, followed by static stretches.
Invariably, CCR’s weekend runs are followed by a post-run detox and hydration session combined with some fellowship. “Hydration, as much as proper clothing and equipment is part of a runner’s gear,” said Asha De Vos, a CCR spokesperson.
CCR also provides its members run training in the form of midweek speed runs, support and advice and a platform for participation in major events such as the LSR Colombo Marathon. Members also benefit by following a training schedule designed by the more experienced runners in the group that supports individuals to achieve their personal objectives at their chosen event.
Some of the key highlights of RBN’s sporting season for 2016/17 were the RBN Rugby partnerships with St. Peters College, St. Josephs College and Zahira College Colombo. Additionally, the brand was the platinum sponsor for ‘Run for their Lives’, the annual cancer fund-raising project hosted by the Rotaract Club of Colombo Uptown.
