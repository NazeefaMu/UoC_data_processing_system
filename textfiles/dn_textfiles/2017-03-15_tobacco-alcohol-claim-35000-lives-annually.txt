Tobacco, alcohol claim 35,000 lives annually

Around 35,000 Sri Lankans die each year due to the use of tobacco and alcohol, and five percent of them (1,750) are children. Seventy percent of deaths of warded patients in hospitals in Sri Lanka are due to Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs), Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Dr. Senaratne, the main reason for the rapidly increasing NCDs in the country is the use of tobacco and alcohol.
The excessive use of salt, sugar and fat has a significant impact.
The minister was addressing the opening of several fitness centres in the Kalutara district recently. The Health Ministry has provided Rs. 2 million worth equipment for each fitness centre.
Minister Dr. Senaratne pointed out that the ministry expects to reduce the presence of NCDs in Sri Lanka by five percent by 2020. It is also expected to register 5,000 people for one medical practitioner and screen them for NCDs.
The concept of `Family Doctor’ will be introduced to Sri Lanka soon and screening will be made available for people through lifestyle and well-woman centres.
Minister Dr. Senaratne explained at length the services carried out by the government for the advancement of the health sector and action to be taken to improve the health of the people.
