Law catches up with BCCI

Reform has been forced down the throat of the Indian cricket board (BCCI) officials. The highest court of the land did it. A former Chief Justice of India (CJI) recommended the structural and operational changes in BCCI; the current CJI was on the two-member Supreme Court bench that accepted most of those recommendations. In effect, this change comes from the highest legal authority in the country. BCCI must see the writing on the wall and accept change with grace.
Despite some very sharp and sarcastic comments by the Supreme Court judges during the course of the arguments, BCCI shut its eyes and ears and hammered one point again and again — that the court cannot encroach upon its autonomy. BCCI and its affiliated units shouted themselves hoarse, insisting that Justice Lodha Committee's recommendations to reform BCCI must not be accepted. All of them built their case on one point — that even the highest court of the country cannot touch BCCI because it is an autonomous body.
But the Supreme Court bench of TS Thakur and Justice FMI Kalifulla disdainfully disregarded this argument. They held that BCCI must be open to legal scrutiny because it discharges state functions of selecting the team that represents the country.
The judgement notes that: “Neither BCCI nor anyone else has assailed the findings recorded by the Committee insofar as the deep-rooted malaise that pervades in the working of the BCCI is concerned”. In plain words, the two judges pointed out that neither BCCI or the state associations protested that the findings of the Justice Lodha Committee were incorrect or unfair.
BCCI did not complain that the dubious practices and management issues raised by the Justice Lodha Committee were not factually unsupportable. Their sole defence was rather audacious, even arrogant — that the country's highest court, and the country's top judges, did not have the legal power to do something about the serious issues the Justice Lodha Committee raised. It's extraordinary that this was the best defence the best, most-expensive lawyers in the country could come with for BCCI. At one point, they argued that conflict of interest is a “fact of life” and must be lived with!
Defending the indefensible
But the fact is that these lawyers were having to defend the indefensible. The origin of the case lies in the 2013 spot-fixing and betting scandal in the IPL, which showed how conflict of interest situations lead to dubious and corrupt decision-making. Remember N Srinivasan, the sticky and tenacious man who just could not be embarrassed by the worst scandals around him? He was the BCCI president and owner of IPL team Chennai Super Kings. Remember his son-in-law Gurunath Meiyappan, who was arrested for his involvement in that IPL scandal in 2013? The BCCI's response to the scandal was shocking and quite indefensible. Within BCCI, there was practically no response, actually: No official raised a voice against Srinivasan. The officials included politicians such as Farooq Abdullah, Narendra Modi, Arun Jaitley, Rajeev Shukla, Anurag Thakur, to name just a few.
BCCI set up a committee of two retired judges who, after a brief investigation, found “no evidence of any wrongdoing” on the part of Gurunath Meiyappan and Rajasthan Royals co-owner Raj Kundra in the betting and spot-fixing scandal. Later, during the course of the hearing, the honourable Supreme Court judges wondered whether BCCI had used its influence to get a favourable verdict.
Eventually, the Supreme Court blew away BCCI's contention that it is a “private society” not open to judicial scrutiny. It ruled that because it discharges public functions, BCCI is “open to scrutiny by the Courts in exercise of their powers under Article 226 of the Constitution.” This was a watershed moment for Indian cricket and, indeed, Indian sport.
Lure of power
Change is very difficult to accept if it involves being yourself rendered superfluous. It is difficult to accept if your powers are taken away from you and handed over to a fresher set of people. It would be particularly difficult to individuals who're used to absolute, unquestioned and unquestionable powers. The officials of Indian cricket are little tyrants. In their home state association, they runs their fiefdom — cricket stadium, club-house, recreational facilities, sports infrastructure, et al — as per their whims. Who can become a member, and who can become a voter, is decided by them. Often, their friends, relatives, business associates and even personal staff become members and voters. They hand out largesse to their favourites. This includes important positions, and could include lucrative contracts for construction at the stadium. They are also in a position to offer employment to the children of friends, relatives and acquaintances in their association. They become masters of the stick-and-carrot policy—it becomes virtually impossible to defeat them in the election. Thus we have Niranjan Shah of Saurashtara, who's been in control of his association right from 1972. Bansi Lal's family has controlled the Haryana association for three generations. Anurag Thakur has led the Himachal Pradesh association non-stop since 2000. Farooq Abdullah controlled the Jammu and Kashmir association for 35 years.
Reports from Uttar Pradesh say that all the directors of their association are above 70 years. They are Shuaib Ahmed (78), Prem Dhar Pathak (83), Madan Mohan Mishra (83), Satish Kumar Agarwal (79), and Jyoti Bajpai (80). Treasurer KN Tandon is 80. This is the reason they won't like the age cap of 70 years enforced by the Supreme Court.
Former India captain Bishan Singh Bedi, who has crusaded for a clean-up of the sport for a very long time, says that most of the officials can be removed only by death. That, indeed, was the case with Jagmohan Dalmiya, who held on to his position despite declining health and died as BCCI president last year. The Supreme Court has created a blueprint for good governance for BCCI. Indeed, this blueprint must be followed by every sports association in India. Ironically, change and reform has descended on BCCI only because their officials dug their heels in and simply refused to change. – THE TRIBUNE
