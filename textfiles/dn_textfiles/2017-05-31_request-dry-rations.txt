Request for dry rations

Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka yesterday requested the public to donate dry rations instead of cooked food to the Ratmalana camp. He said there are about 5000 displaced people who need cooked food and that military relief teams can fulfill the need for cooked food for these people.
He said the immediate need is now for clean water and dry rations.
Minister Ratnayaka was adressing the media at the Disaster Management Ministry yesterday evening.
