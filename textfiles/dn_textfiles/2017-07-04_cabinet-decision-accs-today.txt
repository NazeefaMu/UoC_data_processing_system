This Secretariat determines the nature of the complaints of major corruption cases to be probed.
The committee established in 2015 after the government led by President Maithripala Sirisena came into power was tasked to observe the public complaints on massive frauds and corruption cases of the previous regime and to refer the true complaints to its chief probing tools, the Police Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) and the Commission to Investigation Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC).
