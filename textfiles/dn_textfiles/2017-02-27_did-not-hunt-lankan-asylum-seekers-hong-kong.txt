Did not hunt for Lankan asylum seekers in Hong Kong

The Sri Lankan Police yesterday rejected foreign media reports that its investigators were in Hong Kong looking for the Lankan asylum seekers who sheltered American whistle-blower Edward Snowden.A recent foreign news report quoting a Lawyer said to be representing the refugees in Hong Kong said Sri Lankan refugees who sheltered fugitive whistle-blower Edward Snowden in Hong Kong have been targeted by law enforcement officers from their home country.
The Media Spokesman for Police, Deputy Inspector General Priyantha Jayakody in a statement said on behalf of the criminal investigation department, he was denying the involvement of any investigations or surveillance conducted against the Sri Lankan families or their relatives living in Sri Lanka who are said to have sheltered Edward Snowden in Hong Kong.
“Further we confirm these allegations are frivolous unfounded and baseless. Also Sri Lanka Police would like to inform that except for a Police officer in the rank of Assistant Superintendent of Police who attended the cyber crime investigation training for Eurasian region organized by the Interpol held from 28th November to 2 nd December 2016 in Hong Kong, no other Police officer attached to criminal investigation department visited Hong Kong in an official capacity” Jayakody in the statement said.
He went on to say that in some instances the Police have come across lawyers representing asylum seekers who are in the habit of propagating false allegations against officers involved maintaining law and order with the ulterior motive of supporting the claim of their clients.
