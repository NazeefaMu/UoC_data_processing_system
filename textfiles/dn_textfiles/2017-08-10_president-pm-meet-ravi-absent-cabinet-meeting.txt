President, PM meet Ravi; absent at Cabinet meeting

President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had met Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake at a special meeting held at the Presidential Secretariat yesterday. The said meeting has taken place following the Cabinet meeting which was held last morning.
Later, a group of SLFP Parliamentarians is said to have met Prime Minister Ranil Wikremesinghe.
According to a reliable source, both discussions were about the no confidence motion against Minister Ravi Karunanayake and the controversy surrounding certain evidence led before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating and inquiring into the Treasury bond issue.
Meanwhile, amidst controversy surrounding Minister of Foreign Affairs Ravi Karunanayake, Cabinet sources informed the Daily News that the Foreign Minister had failed to show up for the weekly Cabinet meeting held at the Presidential Secretariat yesterday.
Though Cabinet meetings are traditionally held on Tuesdays, this week it was postponed to Wednesday morning due to the President’s commitments at the Randoli Perehara in Kandy.
Highly placed sources within the United National Party, of which Karunanayake is the Deputy Leader said “ the general feeling is that he (Karunanayake) should step down and clear his name first”
Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister John Seneviratne said Karunanayake had failed to show up despite many expecting him to do so.
