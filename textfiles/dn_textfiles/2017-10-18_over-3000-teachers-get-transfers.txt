Over 3,000 teachers to get transfers

Ceylon Teachers Union (CTU) Secretary Joseph Stalin said the Education Ministry had taken measures to transfer over 3,000 teachers, who had served in National Schools for over 10 years. There are 38,000 teachers in 353 national schools in the country and nearly 12,000 teachers had served in the same school for more than 10 years.
They hope to implement the transfer scheme to enhance the efficiency by utilising valuable human resources in the education system through optimum teacher allocation.
In order to address this situation, the Ministry has decided to transfer 3,000 Advanced Level teachers, as a first step.
The second phase of this programme will get underway in January 2018 where it is planned to transfer 9,000 teachers from grades one to eleven. All school teachers are subject to transfers after completing five years in service.
