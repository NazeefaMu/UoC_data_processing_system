President’s desire to build promising country

President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday said his desire is to build a promising country with clean politics and bring about an ethical political culture to Sri Lanka.
“The people in the country too are expecting clean politics and impeccably honest and respectable politicians,” said President Sirisena at the Sri Lanka Freedom Party Executive Committee and All Island Working Committee meeting at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute yesterday.
The President said he will never deviate from his political aim of creating a clean political movement in the country.
President Sirisena told SLFP members that he was not bound by any agreements and as always, he was committed to carrying forward the SLFP policies and the party’s vision.
The President also reiterated his stance that there will be no foreign judges in the domestic mechanism which is to be established to probe the alleged human right violations during the three-decade long conflict. Speaking on a recent comment made in this regard by the UN Human Rights Commissioner, the President said he had replied within 24 hours to the Commissioner noting his stance.
The President said the government has done a lot to ensure freedom, democracy and social justice and added that however, the government had a lot more to do to fulfill people’s expectations.
The President said he will provide leadership to the SLFP to create a democratic, corruption-free and prosperous country.
Meanwhile, former Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa’s participation in the meeting yesterday garnered much attention with Minister Dilan Perera describing it as a positive signal of growing unity within the party. According to Perera, President Sirisena speaking at the CC meeting too had emphasized on the importance of maintaining unity within the party in addition to the importance of further strengthening the party machinery from the grassroots level.
The President told the SLFP members to form more youth and women’s organizations at the grassroots level and focus on the upcoming local government elections. SLFP lawyers, union members, trade unions members, SLFP teachers and graduate union members and representatives of other organizations affiliated to the party attended the meeting.
SLFP General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake, former Prime Minister D.M. Jayaratne, UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera, senior members of the SLFP, Ministers Nimal Siripala de Silva and Athauda Seneviratne participated.
