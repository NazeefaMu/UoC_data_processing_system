Lancashire hammer Durham in One-Day Cup

LONDON, Sunday : Lancashire opener Alex Davies hit his first one-day century to help his side hammer Durham by 192 runs on Sunday.
After losing their One-Day Cup opener to holders Nottinghamshire on Thursday, the Red Rose responded well, enjoying their biggest runs victory in this competition in 28 years. Davies (147) and Keaton Jennings (73) set the platform for the hosts’ 314-7.
Tom Bailey, Stephen Parry, Joe Mennie, Matt Parkinson and Liam Livingstone all took two scalps as Durham made 122.
Davies’ knock was Lancashire's highest-ever individual score at Old Trafford in one-day cricket - and their best against a fellow first-class county, beating Neil Fairbrother's 145 against Hampshire at Old Trafford in 1990.
Nottinghamshire suffered their first defeat as defending champions of the One-Day Cup, losing by 49 runs to Northamptonshire at Market Warsop.
Josh Cobb (78), Alex Wakely (72) and Adam Rossington (50) all contributed half-centuries as the the visitors posted a healthy 339-9. Notts lost regular wickets in their chase, although captain Steven Mullaney's 71 kept them in contention. But they ended up comfortably short, all out for 290 with 3.4 overs left.
Warwickshire captain Jeetan Patel took 4-33 and Sam Hain hit a ton as Warwickshire made it two One-Day Cup wins out of two against Yorkshire at Headingley.
After openers Tom Kohler-Cadmore and Adam Lyth put on 80 inside the first 12 overs, Yorkshire were reeled in when both went in the space of three balls, Che Pujara top-scoring with 73. Having limited the Tykes to 247-9, Hain then made a fine unbeaten 102. Jonathan Trott hit 50 as Warwicks made 248-5 to win with 25 balls to spare.
James Hildreth blasted a superb career-best 159 off just 125 balls as Somerset beat Glamorgan by 83 runs for their second One-Day Cup win. Hildreth, who was dropped on 63, smashed eight sixes and 13 fours as Somerset raced to 372-7.
Glamorgan were bowled out for 289 in reply, Colin Ingram top-scoring with 85 off 70, but rarely looked likely to threaten their target.
Paul Stirling struck 125 as Middlesex beat Kent by 70 runs to register their first One-Day Cup win of the summer.
Stirling's 115-ball knock, including 13 fours and five sixes, helped his side make 313-9 - as England white-ball captain Eoin Morgan chipped in with 50. Kent looked to be falling well short when they slipped to 159-6, with Tom Helm's 4-49 doing much of the damage. Heino Kuhn's 90 from 92 deliveries revived their hopes but, after he fell to Helm, they slipped to 243 all out.
Gloucestershire battled to a four-wicket win over Essex after a successful run chase in Bristol.
Gareth Roderick's unbeaten 87 from 89 balls saw the hosts pass their target of 288 with 11 balls to spare. Roderick added 79 for the fifth wicket alongside Ryan Higgins (47), after opener George Hankins had made 77.
Ashar Zaidi's 82 from 77 balls and a 50 from Ravi Bopara had given Essex hope as they posted a solid 287-7, but they were unable to halt Roderick's reply.
