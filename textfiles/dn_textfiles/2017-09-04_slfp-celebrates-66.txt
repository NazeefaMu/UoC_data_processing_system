SLFP celebrates 66

The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) celebrated its 66th anniversary on September 3. The anniversary celebrations was held under the chairmanship of Party Leader President Maithripala Sirisena at the Campbell Park in Colombo. The formation of the SLFP in 1951 marked a turning point in the political history of the country. Until then the Sri Lankan political arena was confined to a contest between the capitalist political elements and those of the Marxist left. The advent of the SLFP marked the entry of a socialist third force.
The entry is important for two other reasons. The political parties hitherto in the Sri Lankan political arena represented generally either the interests of the capitalist class or the urban and plantation area working class. For the first time, the SLFP came forward to represent predominantly the interests of the rural peasantry and the lower middle class.
Sri Lanka had no political party then which took a special interest in Sri Lankan national culture. The SLFP filled that void.
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party was always the party of the common man. Throughout its 66-year proud history, it has engaged in an outstanding national service, right from the declaration of the country as a sovereign Republic to the preservation and promotion of national culture. Let us dedicate ourselves this day to carry forward that mission with greater determination.
