Sharp rise in Maussakelle, Castlereagh reservoir water levels

The water levels of the Maussakelle and Castlereagh reservoirs have been rising sharply during the last few days, following heavy showers in the central hills by 6 a. m., yesterday.
Accordingly, the water levels of Maussakelle and Castleregh were recorded to be 46.09 feet and 14.05 feet below spill level, respectively.
Meanwhile, two sluice gates of the Laxapana reservoir were opened on May 20 afternoon, to discharge excess water following torrential rains.
The Ceylon Electricity Board and the Disaster Management Centre had warned people living downstream in the Kelani river valley to exercise utmost caution.
