Outdated rice stock seized from co-op warehouse

The Public Health Inspectors (PHI) yesterday seized 1,120 Kgs of outdated rice from a warehouse of the Mirigama Cooperative Society.
The value of the outdated rice is said to be over Rs.100,000.
Some of the packs had expired in last November while some others in October.
Preliminary investigations had revealed that the Co-op Society bought rice worth over Rs.700,000 from a mill in Nikaweretiya recently and some expired stock too was among the lot.
The health officers are planning to file legal action following investigations.
