GMOA to launch islandwide token strike today

The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) will launch an islandwide token strike on today (January 30, Tuesday) at 8.00 am, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday he said that emergency treatment will not be affected by the strike and the doctors will carry out all emergency care as usual. The strike will not take place at all children's, maternity, cancer, kidney and army hospitals in the country.
If the health authorities, especially the Health Secretary, does not respond positively to the demands of the GMOA during the past one and half years, before February 05th, there will be tougher trade union action, thereafter. The decision will be made during the the emergency meeting of the GMOA Central Committee, he said.
The corrupt politicians who lied and health authorities who take revenge from doctors for no reason should take the sole responsibility for the hardships that will be undergone by the public due to the strike. Purposely discriminating against doctors, when it comes to granting and revising allowances and other payments and violating the National Wages Policy are among the ten reasons behind launching the strike, he added.
