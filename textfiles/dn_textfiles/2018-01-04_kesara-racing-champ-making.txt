Kesara,  a racing champ  in the making

Kesara Godage, a 11-year- old driver competing in the Udawalawa Sevanagala Supercross held recently won the Youngest Car Driver award. However it has happened unexpectedly, as it was his father, veteran driver Dhammika Godage who was scheduled to be in the car segment contest at the event.
On the eve of the contest, Dhammika had allowed his son Kesara to drive the Nissan March during a practice session. At this moment Kesara had not even possessed a driving licence as he was underage.
But, due to the intervention of Anil Jayakody, Kesara was presented with the licence to compete at the Supercross in the motor car segment.
Kesara was placed third during the initial timing, to the much surprise of many veteran drivers.
During the main event this novice driver won the fourth place.
It was quite a coincidence that Kesara who began his maiden voyage in motor racing riding a 50cc bike five years ago at the Walawa Supercross, also entered the motor car segment at the same venue.
Before competing in the motor car segment, Kesara had proved his potential in motorcycle segment by topping the under-13 category score charts.
Kesara had won the Supercross competitions in Galle and Boyagane, but was forced to recuperate for several months due to an injury at the Fox Hill Supercross.
He then returned to action and won the Gunner Super Cross at Minneriya before repeating the feat at the Gajaba Supercross at Saliyapura.
Kesara continued to showcase his credentials at the Supercross held at Embilipitiya. Godage Jr. also competed at the Katukurunda Rotherham Championship and was featured in the 1500cc Ford Laser/Mazda event.
During the Katukurunda race Kesara caught the attention of Sri Lanka's internationally reputed racing driver Dilantha Malagamuwa, who later predicted that the rookie driver could go places in his chosen sport and bring recognition to Sri Lanka. Kesara Godage who is only 11 is a seventh grade student at Lyceum International School in Nugegoda.
