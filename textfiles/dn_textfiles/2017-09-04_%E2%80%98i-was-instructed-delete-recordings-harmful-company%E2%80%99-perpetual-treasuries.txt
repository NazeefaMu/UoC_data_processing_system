‘I was instructed to delete recordings harmful to the company’: Perpetual Treasuries Chief Dealer

 
Chief Dealer of Perpetual Treasures Limited (PTL) Nuwan Salgado alleged PTL Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Kasun Palisena to have instructed him to delete phone call recordings which were harmful to the company.
He said this before the Presidential Commission appointed to probe into the Central Bank Bond issue today.
It was revealed that the PTL has tampered with telephone call recordings which they handed over to the Treasury Bond Commission on August 29.
The evidence was led through Metropolitan Communication Limited Chief Engineer Nalin Dharmaratne which installed the call logger system at the PTL in June 2015.
