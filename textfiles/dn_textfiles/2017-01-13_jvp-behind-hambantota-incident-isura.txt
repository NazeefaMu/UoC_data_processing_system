JVP behind Hambantota incident: Isura

It was the JVP more than the Joint Opposition that ignited Hambantota people's emotions, Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya said.
Addressing the media in Colombo yesterday, he said the JVP misled the Southern people to gain political benefits. UPFA General Secretary, Minister Mahinda Amaraweera has said that the protestor wanted to get someone killed and bloodshed. The Joint Opposition should not do politics resorting to violence, he said.
Devapriya said the Local Government election can be held after May. He said the Local Government election will be gazetted after the handing over of the report of the delimitation committee. The Pradeshiya Sabha Act (22nd article) will be amended before the election, he said.
According to the report, the number of seats will be changed. The SLFP does not wish to postpone it further on any grounds, Chief Minister Devapriya said.
Chief Minister Devapriya said one of the major problems in Sri Lanka is unplanned development. President R. Premadasa could not complete his project of establishing 200 garment factories because there was no good road network, he said.
The Chief Minister said there should be industrial zones around harbours and airports. There are industrial zones around Katunayake and Ratmalana airports, he said.
