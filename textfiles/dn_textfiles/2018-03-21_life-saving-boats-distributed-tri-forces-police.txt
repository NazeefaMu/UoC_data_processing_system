Life saving boats distributed to Tri-Forces, Police

Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa distributed life saving boats at the Meteorological Department yesterday.
The Minister said “We distribute these boats to the Tri-Forces and Sri Lanka Police for search and rescue operations during times of disaster. Accordingly, 47 boats were distributed to the Army, Five boats to the Navy, Nine boats to the Air Force and 65 boats to the Sri Lanka Police.
“The people face many issues due to flood situations.
During the flood situation last year, our Security Forces and Police personnel did not have a sufficient number of boats to help distressed people.
Therefore, we should be prepared in advance during times of natural disasters,” Minister Yapa said.
“These boats are made in Sri Lanka and a single boat can accommodate for Six people,”he said.
Disaster Management Ministry Director Genaral S.Amalanadan, Disaster Management Ministry Secretary Kingsly Fernando and personnel from the Security Forces and Police also participated.
