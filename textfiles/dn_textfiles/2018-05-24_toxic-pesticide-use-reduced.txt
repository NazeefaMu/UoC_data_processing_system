Toxic pesticide use reduced

The use of pesticides with high toxicity has been reduced in Sri Lanka in the past few years due to the awareness programmes conducted by the Agriculture Department, its sources said.
Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said the Agriculture Department is currently conducting a programme to discourage the use of pesticides with high toxicity. As a result, the use of pesticides with very low toxicity has increased in the country.
According to the statistics of the Office of the Registrar of Pesticides, around 40 varieties of pesticides with high toxicity had been used in the country in 2002 and it had reduced by 98 percent. Only one such pesticide is currently being used in Sri Lanka.
Around 187 pesticides with a medium toxicity level had been registered in 2002. Only 133 such pesticides were registered in 2016. Around 88 pesticides with low toxicity had been registered in 2002 and it had increased to 168 this year. Around 115 pesticides with very low toxicity had been registered in 2002 and it had increased to 162 this year.
