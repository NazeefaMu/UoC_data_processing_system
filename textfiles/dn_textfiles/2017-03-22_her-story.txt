Her story

Women all over the world celebrated the International Womens Day recently – a time to reflect on the endlers value of the mother. Sri Lanka recognises the motherhood as precious. All have realised that the contribution a women to the entire globe is invaluable. All will agree that there is one among the humanity much adored by everybody. The world owes much to her. It is with her the world begins. She gave the universe the unity never known before the world survives with her. She is the finest in the world. Her mission was a great civilizing factor in the world. She is the most noble being the world has yet produced unsurpassed by anyone. Who is this miraculous marvel? She is none other than your mother simple woman turned mother.
Next to Buddha the perfect one here is a being, who sacrifices her own comforts in the interests of her family. She is the guiding spirit to the family. The personality of the mother towers above all others. She has a wider appeal, in that she has developed a strong element in human society.
The mother occupied a unique place in Buddhism. Sakyamni Siddhartha Gautama the world teacher, throughout his life and in many of his previous births (Bosath0 created an important place for women in society – specially the mother. Many of the Jataka stories are a unique reflection of religious tradition depicting the pride of place given to the mother.
All human emotions love, sorrow, joy are depicted in the best form in discourses on mother. The stories of mother portray no ill-will anger or disgust. Each presents of narration of good qualities, virtue and moral values. Matu Poshaka Jathaka is the best example. It relates how Bosath kept his mother on his back and swam across the mighty ocean, getting her blessings for future Boddhahood. Another best known story among the Buddhists is Vessantara Jatakaya in which the life of Madri Devi, the mother of Jaliya and Krishnajina is an outstang example for helping boast to fulfill his ‘Dana Paramita'. Amazing stories such as Thiththira Jatakaya taught them how the elders should be treated and revered with due care and respect.
The great master throughout his teachings placed the mother in very high esteem in the Suttas too. He has enumerated this in Prabawa Sutta. Buddha taught a young man how to adjust himself to his parents, wife, friends and Master in Singalowada Sutta. Buddha said, the mother is the friend at home. According to Magala Sutta, supporting one's parents Mata Pitu Upattanam is the highest blessing that are can achieve. Mother has been a topic of discussion in the Buddhist legend and tradition. Here the mothers love is confined not only to her own children, but to the others as well, which is evident from the infancy of Prince Siddhartha. Seven days after his birth when Queen Mahamaya passed away, it was Maha Prajapathy Gothami, who looked after the babe giving preference to him. Over her two children. In his attempt to find the gem of truth, as an ascetic Prince Siddhartha suffering for six long years (Dushkarakriya) he was reduced to skin and bone. Queen Mother Mahamaya who was in heaven (Thavuthisa) as Marthru Divyaraja descended on the earth to support him in his quest to relieve universal suffering. After the supreme enlightenment the Buddha visited Thavathimsa to preach Abhidhamma to Marthru in heaven to show his gratitude.
In Buddhist society the mother is admired as the Buddha at home “Gedara Budun Amma” There is a national flow of mettah form the mother when she dedicates herself to the well-being and happiness of her children with no envy or jealousy what so ever. It is the mother who makes the child creative, innovative and enterprising with emphasis on discipline, in his or her formative years. Hence the mother is there throughout one's life, even after her demise. It is the woman who becomes the mother. Woman is a product of the mother and vice versa. Both ones are held in high esteem. Mother in perticular accomplish many things and perform her duties within her span of life. Mothers in it's entirety deserve the praise of the entire globe.
