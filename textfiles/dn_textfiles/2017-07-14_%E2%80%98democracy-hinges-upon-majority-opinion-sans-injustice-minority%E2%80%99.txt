‘Democracy hinges upon majority opinion sans injustice of minority’

Democracy means the use of the majority opinion in a manner that does not cause injustice to the minority. The vision of the Elections Commission is to ensure a nation which safeguards universal suffrage, Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said.
Deshapriya made these observations speaking at a seminar on “universal suffrage, democracy and peoples sovereignty” at the Matara District Secretariat on Tuesday. The seminar was organised by the University Teachers' Association.
Deshapriya said laws relating to free and fair elections should be stern and strong. If people voted for policies rather than election promises, it could be described as democracy. There should be a level playing field if people's sovereignty is to be safeguarded. The basis of administrative power is public opinion expressed through periodical elections held on schedule, he said.
"Nowhere in the world have election commissions been empowered to hold elections according to a schedule. It is decided by Parliaments. Legislative power is entrusted to Parliament," Deshapriya said.
"If it is to be interpreted in cricket parlance even if the two teams and the pitch is ready, the match cannot be played without the ICC approval. Our ICC as regards elections is Parliament," the Election Commission Chairman said.
Ruhuna University Science Faculty Dean Prof. Jayantha Pasdunkorale spoke.
