March 12 Movement vows to unsit unfit winners at upcoming polls

The March 12 (M12) Movement would go before the court to unsit the winning non-suitable candidates at the impending local government election provided that any of the 50 such non-suitable candidates were elected, said executive director of People’s Action for Free and Fair Election (PAFFREL) Rohana Hetiarachchi recently.
He said that the M12 Movement would reveal the names of the wards that those candidates would contest in due course for the knowledge of the voters.
Hetiarachchi made these observations yesterday during a press conference organized by the March 12 Movement held at the CSR, Maradana.
He also said that out of the 56,066 candidates, 8,356 would be selected for the 341 local government bodies across the country. He added that M12 Movement has received reports on 50 candidates about their non-suitability to become representatives due to their corrupt background. Hetiarachchi also added that they have been nominated from the four main political parties in the country.
He added that reports on nine candidates from Colombo, seven from Kegalle, six from Galle and six from Matara have already been received by the M12 movement. Fourteen candidates have complaints on illegal liquor trade, six on attacking individuals, six on murder allegations, 14 on financial frauds, five on being underworld leaders, one on rape and molesting and four on illegal confiscated wood racket.
Hetiarachchi requested the voters to cast their votes to select the party which consists of the best people to represent them.
Manjula Gajanayake from Centre for Monitoring Election Violence (CMEV) addressing the press conference said the expenditure of the oncoming local government election is around Rs 3,500 million and a sum of Rs 179 million would be spent at minimum monthly to pay the allowances to the 8,356 members.
He added that a member would be paid a sum of Rs 15,000 while a deputy chairman a sum of Rs 20,000 and a chairman Rs 25,000 in addition to their Rs 3,000 traveling allowance and Rs 3,000 phone bill allowance. He added that this would be the minimum and could be doubled or more on the members’ demands.
Samadani Kiriwandeniya of Sanasa Development Bank, Athauda Seneviratne from Organization of Professional Associations, Shashee de Mel from Transparency International and Pradeepa from Mothers and Daughters of Lanka also expressed their views at the occasion.
