HFC Kurunegala crowned Airtel netball champs

In yet another exhilarating end to the ‘All Island School Games Netball Championship 2016’ sponsored Airtel, Holy Family Convent Kurunegala continued their winning streak yet again by securing the overall title to be crowned as Airtels’ Netball champions of 2016 in both Under 19 and 17 age groups.
The Under 19 Familians were able to do so by beating Presbyterian B.V. Dehiwala (31-23). In the under 17 final HFC Kurunegala beat Hillwood Kandy 21-12.
In the first semi-finals between the Familians from Kurunegala and Kalutara in the Under-15 age group, HFC Kurunegala secured an easy win against its sister school while Maliyadeva B.V. Kurunegala beat Visakha Vidyalaya Colombo to enter the finals. Maliyadeva B.V. Kurunegala proved to be the better team in the North Western Province when they beat HFC Kurunegala 14-12 in the finals.
Hillwood College Kandy was the only school from the Central Province to secure a place in the final in the Under-17 age group. They beat Visakha Vidyalaya Colombo 5-2 while Girls High School Kandy lost to Holy Family Convent Kurunegala in the other semi-final.
Sacred Heart Convent’s dream of entering the finals was again shattered by Holy Family Convent Kurunegala who beat them by a large margin 33-8 to meet Presbyterian B.V- Dehiwala who showed some brilliant skills to be the only school in the Western Province to come into the final. This is also the first time that the Presbyterians were able to achieve this result.
