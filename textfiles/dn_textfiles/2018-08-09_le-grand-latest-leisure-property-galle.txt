The Sitting Room offers the greatest views of the entire hotel with a spacious open-air poolside terrace that provides a tranquil retreat from the urban lifestyle.
Le Grand, Galle takes a fresh approach to dining experiences with its use of rustic and ruggedly tropical décor. TASTE, an all-day dining restaurant offers the ambiance and simplicity of a modern bistro with food that is delightful and brings back memories of home. BLUE, the speciality seafood restaurant boasts an open kitchen, an enviable wine list and sprawling views of the deep blue ocean. The exquisite meals are prepared using seafood delivered daily by local fisherman.
Commenting on the architectural design of Le Grand, Galle, principal architect of the property, Philip Weeraratne from PWA Architects said two extremely distinct and exclusive characteristics of this property were the stunning view of the world heritage monument, the Galle fort and its ramparts across the azure blue waters of the Indian Ocean.
“Absorbing all this, it was only natural that our creation and its form should be respectful in proportion, form and texture. We also wanted to position the spaces and unravel the hotel as an exciting maze of discoveries of long vistas and framed views of both the fort and ocean which were an ever changing mural and scape to feast your eyes on,” Weeraratne.
The property offers a state-of-the-art gym, Jacuzzi, sauna, steam room, as well as beauty and massage treatments in the spa area where Balinese therapists combine traditional rituals with precious oils and salves to nurture balance and restore a guest’s peace of body and mind.
