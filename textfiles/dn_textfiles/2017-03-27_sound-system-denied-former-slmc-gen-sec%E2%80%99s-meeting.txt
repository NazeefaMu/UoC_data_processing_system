Sound system denied for former SLMC Gen. Sec.’s meeting

The Sammanthurai police had asked not to use sound system at the meeting held by Sri Lanka Muslim Congress former General Secretary M.T. Hasen Ali on Saturday at the Nintavur Base Hospital in Ampara.
The meeting was organised by the former General Secretary to explain the steps taken by him against Sri Lanka Muslim Congress Leader Rauff Hakeem. The meeting was held up to 11 pm despite the pressure exerted by various parties.
Addalaichenai Predesheeya Sabha Former Chairman Anzil said they did not hold the meeting against the SLMC, but some politicians are in fear that they would be chased out from the people and would not be elected at future elections.
“The SLMC wants to satisfy a group of people, not the whole community.
They wanted to show Hasen as a person who wants to be a parliamentarian. The SLMC leader appoints the Secretary, National list MPs and speaks about Coastal Administrative District temporarily.
The SLMC led by Rauff Hakeem has no policy but it works for the satisfaction of its political authorities,” sources said.
