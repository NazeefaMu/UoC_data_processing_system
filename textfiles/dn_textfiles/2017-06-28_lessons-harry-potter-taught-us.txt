For this very special occasion, we’ve calmed down, wiped some tears, remembered the good times, and collected the best lessons Harry, Ron, Hermione, Neville, Luna, Draco, Snape, and Dumbledore taught us.

Journalists who stalk and slut-shame teenagers are pure evil. Shut them down before they enable a tyrant regime.
— Priya Sridhar
We always have a choice. We can choose to give up. We can choose to push forward. We can choose to give in to our fear. We can choose to confront it. The hardest choices can come with both the most severe consequences and the greatest rewards. The point is that we have a choice. Always.
