Arjun Aloysius arrives before CID

 
Former Perpetual Treasury Director Arjun Aloysius arrived at the Criminal Investigation Division (CID) attached to the Treadury Bond Commission a short while ago. 
He was summoned by the CID to record a statement on the recovered call recordings which were presented before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) yesterday. 
The recovered call recordings revealed that Arjun Aloysius had received sensitive inside information on the February 27, 2015 Treasury bond auction from a 'powerful friend'.
