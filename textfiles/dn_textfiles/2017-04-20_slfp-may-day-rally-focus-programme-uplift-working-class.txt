SLFP May Day rally to focus on programme to uplift working class

Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya said yesterday that all arrangements have been finalised to hold the SLFP May Day rally at Gatambe in Kandy on a grand scale. Addressing a media briefing in Colombo, he said that the rally will be held in a manner that minimizes any inconveniences to motorists and commuters who travel via Kandy on May 1.
“This will be the third May Day rally after President Maithripala Sirisena became President.Therefore, the President has advised us to hold this year's SLFP May Day rally not an an image building exercise for the party, but a real programme to uplift the working class.
“Our fight is not with the UNP but with the JO. But, looking at the previous May Day rallies held in Galle and Colombo, it was proved that the real people’s power is with President Maithripala Sirisena. There are reports that the JO will plan to provoke the people and get seek Police intervention in order to put the try and embarass the government during its May Day rally scheduled to be held at Galle Face,” Devapriya said.
“But,the May Day rally should not be held for political purposes, but as a cerebration of the rights of the working class,” he said.
Commenting on the Colombo's Garbage Problems,the Western Province Chief Minister said that the CMC had identified several places in Colombo for garbage disposal since permission has been granted to dump garbage in Karadiyana only for a few days.The Proposed Karadiyana Waste Management Centre will be implemented as a large scale project.The entire Karadiyana area will be turned into an attractive destination under this programme.
“In addition to the Karadiyana project, several waste management programmes will initiated in Kalutara and Muthurajawela. Therefore, there will be no garbage problem in Colombo in the future,”he said.
“The Megapolis and Western Development Ministry will handover the report detailing how the Meethotamulla garbage mound can be removed in less than six months. We early offered Rs.15,000 monthly to each house holder for six months to find alternative houses. But they did not move from this area. We have already constructed 60 houses in Salamulla which will be given to beneficiaries soon. We will also work out a compensation formula for destroyed multi storied houses.
