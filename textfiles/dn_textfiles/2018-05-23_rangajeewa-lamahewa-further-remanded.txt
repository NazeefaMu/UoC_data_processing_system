Police Narcotics Bureau Inspector Neomal Rangajeewa and Prisons Commissioner Emil Ranjan Lamahewa, who were in remand custody over the Welikada Prison riots in 2012, were further remanded until June 5 by Colombo Additional Magisitrate Chamari Wijesuriya yesterday.
The CID submitted a further report to the magistrate, which included that the CID was conducting investigations regarding the calls taken by Police Narcotics Bureau Inspector Neomal Rangajeewa’s mobile phone.
The CID informed court that firearms that were used to kill those twenty seven inmates were sent to the Government Analyst.
The CID also informed that statements were recorded from some army officials.
The counsel appearing for the aggrieved party informed the Magistrate that the investigations have not been carried out on the persons who permitted those suspects to enter the prison premises to which the CID submitted that investigations are being carried out to find out those persons.
Rangajeewa and Lamahewa were arrested by the CID on March 28 in connection with the Welikada prison riots shooting. Twenty seven inmates were killed and over 20 others injured in the shooting during the riot on November 9, 2012.
The additional magistrate also ordered the counsel appearing for the suspects to make their submission orally on the next hearing day.
