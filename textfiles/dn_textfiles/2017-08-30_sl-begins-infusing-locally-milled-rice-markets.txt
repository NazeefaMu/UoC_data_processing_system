SL begins infusing locally milled rice to markets

Sri Lanka had started infusing locally milled rice to markets and had also inked an agreement with Indian private suppliers for immediate rice tranches to Colombo.“We are also going ahead with the Indian rice orders,” said Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen on August 29. He said so during discussions with his top officials on the latest moves by his ministry on domestic rice supplies.
“Under the direction of President Maithripala Sirisena, we released 52,000 MT of locally milled rice to the markets by last weekend,” said Minister Bathiudeen, “These rice stocks were milled from paddy from the Paddy Marketing Board. We are also going ahead with the Indian rice orders; they are giving us a very competitive price.”
Accordingly, last Friday (25), the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and its Cooperative Wholesale Establishment (CWE) have, in a government-to-overseas private sector MoU, placed an order for the supply of 70,000 MT of Nadu rice to Sri Lanka.
This tranche is expected to land here in mid-September. Another MoU with Indian private sector for 30,000 MT of Samba rice is to be inked in Colombo anytime. This rice stock is expected to arrive during late September.
On July 31, the CWE, under Minister Bathiudeen, began pulling local paddy stocks for milling.
Under the orders of the Cost of Living Committee on July 26, the CWE started extracting 80,000 MT of paddy with the Paddy Marketing Board’s warehouses to mill in the CWE’s own mills, as well as through private millers.
CWE sources said that 52,000 MT of milled rice from these paddy stocks have already been delivered to Lanka Sathosa during last weekend to be sold to the public at the lowest possible price. The 52,000 MT tranche consists of a variety of rice types.
As a result of Indian purchases and domestic paddy milling, a total of 152,000 MT of rice is flooding the market-of which 52,000 MT is already in the markets at this moment.
