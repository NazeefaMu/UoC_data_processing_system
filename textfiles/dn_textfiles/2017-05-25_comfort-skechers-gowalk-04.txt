Comfort with Skechers Gowalk 04

 The recently unveiled SKECHERS GOWalk 04 series provides us with a further incentive to walk more in our day-to-day lives by offering footwear that presents exceptional fit, comfort, and support, while allowing us to feel both confident and stylish at the same time.
Recognising that comfort is instrumental towards producing an enjoyable walking experience, SKECHERS has specially designed the Goga Max? insole for the GOWalk 04 range.
This insole offers high-caliber cushioning and support as well as a roomier fit for any foot type.
The Goga Max?also greatly enhances the shock-absorbency of the shoe, thereby, mitigating the effects of hard surfaces on your feet, ankles, knees, and hips.
Plus, this unique insole infuses the SKECHERS GOWalk 04 series with high posturepedic and orthopedic comfort value by providing an even balance and grip on the floor, and offering instant pressure relief.
Thus, Goga Max?insole makes the SKECHERS GOWalk 04 range perfect for individuals, ranging from young adults to senior citizens, who desire to get out and walk more.
The 5GEN? midsole design with an advanced mesh upper and bamboo lined footbed makes the SKECHERS GOWalk 04 perfect for our tropical weather.
The bamboo lined footbed wicks away both sweat and moisture to inhibit the production of bacteria and foul odours.
Switch to a more active, healthy lifestyle by walking into your nearest SKECHERS store and purchasing the SKECHERS GOWalk 04 Range.
