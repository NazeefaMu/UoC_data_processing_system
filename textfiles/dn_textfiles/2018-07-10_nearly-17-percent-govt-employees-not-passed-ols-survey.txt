Nearly 17 percent of Govt. employees not passed O/Ls - Survey

The Department of Census and Statistics in a recent survey on government and semi-government employees has found that 17 percent of employees had not even passed the GCE O/L examination.
Among this number, a higher percentage of men at 27.2 percent had not passed their O/L exams whilst only 4.8 percent of women fell in the same category.
The Department had conducted its survey in November 2016 and covered the Public Sector which usually comprises organisations that are owned and operated by the government and exist to provide services such as public education, healthcare, national defence, military, police, infrastructure (public roads, bridges, tunnels, water supply, sewers, electrical grids, telecommunications, etc.) for its citizens.
As of November 17 2016, there were 1,109,475 employees working in the above sectors. Of them, 55.1 percent are male whilst 44.9 percent are female. The uniformed staff of the three forces: Army, Navy and Air Force were however not covered by this census.
The survey also showed that the majority, at 35 percent were GCE A/L qualified and of this number, little over one fourth (26.1 percent), had a degree or higher qualification. It was women who were heading the qualified list with a greater percentage of 36.7 percent holding degrees while only 17.6 percent of men had a higher education qualification.
“There are 290,378 graduates employed in the public and semi government sectors.Of them 2,014 have reported to have more than one basic degree. More than half the graduates (54 percent) have degrees in the Arts Stream while Management/ Commerce graduates are 14.3 percent, and Science graduates only 10.4 percent”. Public and Semi Government sector employees constitute five percent of the country’s population and constitute 14 percent of the employed population.
