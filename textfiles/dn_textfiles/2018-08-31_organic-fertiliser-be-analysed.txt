Organic fertiliser to be analysed

Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera yesterday instructed the National Fertilizer Secretariat to conduct scientific research on the chemical content of organic fertiliser made out of municipal waste.
During a progress review meeting held at the Ministry yesterday, Minister Amaraweera gave this instruction following a number of complaints received by the Ministry from certain groups which claimed that the organic fertilisers contain high levels of cadmium.
“Encouraging farmers to engage in organic farming is a really good thing. But if they contain heavy metals, these fertilisers will badly affect the health of the people,” the Minister said.
