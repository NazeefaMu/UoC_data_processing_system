Due to Tamil Separatism: Nearly 25,363 tri forces, civil defence forces members killed during 1972 to 2009

Chief Government Whip and Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Minister Gayantha Karunathillake said that 25,363 members of the tri forces and civil defence force had been killed during 1972 to 2009 period due to the issue of Tamil Separatism. He said that due to the same issue 38,675 members of the same forces have been rendered disable.
He also said the statistics of the murder of civilians during this period was not recorded. He added that the statistics of the injured members of the tri forces and civil defence force were also not available. He also added that almost all of them have suffered injuries in the war. He made these observations in response to a question raised by Opposition MP Udaya Gammanpila during the round of questions for oral answers.
MP Gammanpila questioned if the Police had not maintained statistics on the murders committed by the LTTE in bomb blasts and mass murders committed in villages. Minister Karunathillake said that he would keep the relevant minister informed of the query as it should be answered with a sense of responsibility.
