Political turmoil in Maldives allowing IS space to establish terror root

US: Maldives appears to be emerging as yet another potential hub for the Islamic State (IS) and their supporters.
Well placed sources here have revealed that the ongoing political turmoil in the Maldives, a tropical nation of 26 islands, is giving space to the IS or ISIS to establish a dangerous and frightening terror presence that could have adverse internal security and economic repercussions, both in the short as well as the long term.
The sources said the political turmoil in the archipelago has surfaced because of the existence of two distinct camps – one supposedly loyal to President Abdulla Yameen and the other to Vice President Adeeb.
Late last month, in an alarming revelation, Islamic radicals linked to IS and the jihadist group ‘Bilad Al Sham Media’, which is believed to be based in Syria and the Maldives, claimed responsibility for the September 28 explosion aboard a speed boat that was carrying President Yameen and First Lady Fathimath Ibrahim. Both narrowly escaped with their lives, but their bodyguard and an official attached to the President’s Office suffered injuries and had to be admitted to the Indira Gandhi Memorial Hospital in capital Male for treatment.
According to sources, a three-minute-long YouTube video carrying the IS logo has triggered speculation of the IS or ISIS being behind the incident reportedly because its demands for the release of Adhaalath Party leader Sheikh Imran and the withdrawal of the new anti-terror bill are yet to be met.
The reported IS involvement, appears to indicate the possibility of Maldives security forces getting increasingly radicalised, and the well placed sources are claiming that the attack on President Yameen could not have taken place without IS elements penetrating the country’s elite Maldivian National Defence Force (MNDF).
