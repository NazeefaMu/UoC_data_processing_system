Fertiliser shortage in Anuradhapura

Farmers in Anuradhapura have been facing a fertiliser shortage for a long time following the drought that lasted for over one-and-a-half years. They mainly lack Triple Super Phosphate (TSP).
Therefore, they are have been unable continue cultivation activities for the 2018/2019 Maha season although they had received an adequate amount of water through the recent monsoonal rains.
Anuradhapura Agrarian Development Department Assistant Commissioner Asanka Somawansa said the the Lak Pohora company had not provided sufficient TSP subsidies on time.
He said that aside from the Lak Pohora company, the Colombo Commercial Company was also responsible for providing TSP, muriate of potash (MOP) and urea to the Agrarian Development Department. Somawansa said the issue would be solved soon as a ship carrying fertiliser stocks was scheduled to arrive at Sri Lanka on November 27.
It had also been reported that traders in the open market had refused to sell fertiliser subsidies after its price was changed from Rs.1,500 to Rs.1,000 per 50-kilogram sack; they had said that it was not guaranteed that they would be reimbursed for the Rs.500 price gap.
There had also been allegations that certain traders had attempted to extort farmers into buying urea subsidies before they could purchase TSP or MOP.
Somawansa said that agriculture research and development assistants had been instructed to look into the matter with the assistance of the National Fertiliser Secretariat.
