SAITM MBBS students urge authorities for fair, expeditious solution

As graduates and students of the MBBS programme at the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM), we urge authorities to provide a fair and expeditious solution to our current predicament, which has and continues to deprive us from completing our internship training to be fully registered medical practitioners, states SAITM MBBS students in a release.
The release adds: “We regret that despite the clear directive of the Court of Appeal on January 31, 2017, whereby SAITM MBBS graduates were granted the right of provisional registration, obstacles continue to be placed in our path by various parties with malicious intent, without the greater good in mind.
“We were all eligible to pursue our undergraduate training in medicine at prestigious foreign universities.
However, we as Sri Lankan citizens, wished to pursue our higher education in the field of medicine in Sri Lanka and SAITM offered us this opportunity.Students registered for the SAITM MBBS degree programme have fulfilled all the stipulated University Grants Commission (UGC) entry criteria and are solely from the Bio Science stream of the A/L examinations.
Contrary to various misinformation being disseminated to the public, there are no students from the arts or commerce streams in the SAITM MBBS programme. We further have no hesitancy in submitting our A/L results, as duly required by the SLMC, when applying for provisional registration,” the release states.
