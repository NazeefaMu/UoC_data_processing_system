‘SLFP held highly successful May Day rally’

The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Youth Front Chairman Shantha Bandara said the SLFP held a separate highly successful May Day rally without any of the parties who supported President Maithripala Sirisena when he contested as the common candidate.
The SLFP May Day rally was held without the UNP ,JVP, TNA, SLMC, Estate parties and various other political forces that supported Maithripala Sirisena at the last presidential election, he said.
He was addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday.
"The biggest victor in all May Day rallies was President Maithripala Sirisena. The SLFP held the most successful May day rally in Gatambe and working people representing all electorates including over 100,000 youth participated at the SLFP May Day rally," Bandara said. "We did not give prominence to the rally itself, but to the procession. However, certain political parties showed a big crowd without holding a procession," he said.
He said a crowd of about 200,000 gathered in Gatambe and such a large crowd was presented because numerous concessions given to the public and the private sector workers by the government.
"Now the SLFP is going on a new journey and we have no competition with anyone,” Bandara said. He said President Sirisena unlike other SLFP leaders had to face unprecedented challenges. "Several factions attempt to block his efforts.
We urge them to read the history of the party, he said.
Although several factions were separated from the party previously, they all finally return to the SLFP. We want to get back even the people who are not helping us. We do not want them to join with the government, but with the SLFP, Bandara said.
