Child abuse increases in NCP

According to Police, child abuse cases in Dambulla, Sigiriya and Galewela divisions, have increased during the past year. Around 22 cases were reported within this period.
The victimised girls were below 17 years of age. Investigations revealed that most of them have had love affairs with married persons, as well as other young men.
Furthermore, a better part of the mothers of the victims are employed in Middle-East countries, while their fathers are addicted to liquor and illegal substances.
Police have launched awareness programmes to educate people especially in rural areas, with a view to save children.
