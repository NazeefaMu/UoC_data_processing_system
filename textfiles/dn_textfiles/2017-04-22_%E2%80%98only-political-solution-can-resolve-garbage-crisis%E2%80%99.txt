‘Only political solution can resolve garbage crisis’

Garbage issue is political, and it can be resolved only with a political solution. Some politicians do not support in finding a solution in this regard because they gain benefits from the collected waste, Frontline Socialist Party (FSP) Propaganda Secretary Pubudu Jagoda said.
Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday, he said a 2 kg of waste per person was accumulated in Colombo, while the average waste accumulation per person in the whole country should be 800g.
Referring to the gazette notification issued to make the garbage management an essential service, Jagoda said the gazette notification abolishes the right to take actions against disposing garbage since obstructing garbage garbage dumping at any place will be considered as an offence with the gazette notification.
He said dumping garbage is mainly a social class issue. The lower class population always had to suffer with the garbage issue, while politicians and the middle class did not pay attention to the end result of their collected garbage until the Meethotamulla garbage dump collapsed killing many people. The Government has to provide a sustainable solution for this issue at least by now, he said.
Jagoda said the main reason for accumulating waste unlimitedly was the over- production of goods by large-scale organisations for profits.
“Arukkalu is a buffer zone of the Wilpattu sanctuary. Relocating garbage in Arukkalu will create grave issues for living beings in the area and their environment,” Jagoda said.
Referring to the SAITM issue, the Propaganda Secretary said the SAITM was registered with the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) as a solution to the issue.
“It is fake since it does not resolve the issues that the innocent students face. It is also invalid since it was taken by politicians even though the power to take such decisions are with the SAITM Board of Directors,” he said.
Jagoda said well-established medical colleges worldwide are non profit entities and education must not be used as a commodity to earn profit.
