Mahendran’s cross examination on Friday

Attorney General’s panel seeks postponement :
The cross examination of former Governor Arjun Mahendran will resume from September 22, 2017 following a request made by the Attorney General’s panel assisting the Treasury Bond Commission for an adjournment, yesterday (20).
While the private counsel panels cross examined the former Governor Arjun Mahendran, the Attorney General’s panel requested time to properly prepare for the cross examination based on its importance and the volume of evidence to be led through Mahendran.
Acting Solicitor General Dappula de Livera, forwarding a motion, stated that they need time to prepare for the cross examination so that they are seeking an adjournment until the said date.
ASG Livera pointed out that the AG’s panel has volumes of evidence and material to focus on when cross examining Arjun Mahendran.
“We do not want to let go of any important matter. His evidence is critical for the investigation. I am sure a proper examination should be done.We have received volumes of evidence and proceedings. Mahendran’s evidence is purely on oral testimony. So, to perform our task, this adjournment is very important.” he said.
Former Governor Arjun Mahendran’s legal representative President’s Counsel Romesh de Silva expressed certain concerns over the motion of adjournment. He pointed out that they as representatives of Mahendran “did not have a clue that they (AG’s panel) are making such a motion. The Commission in fact yesterday told the cross examination will begin today but at that stage the AG’s officers did not make such a motion, De Silva PC pointed out. He also said that he believes AG’s panel, which consist of three President’s Counsels are very much capable of cross examination.” De Silva PC said.
“Still they say they are not ready to cross examining! For some strange reason they are not ready to cross examine because he (Mahendran) is telling the truth!” De Silva pointed out.
However, De Silva PC did not object to the motion. He informed the Commission that he is not available next week since he has a five Judge bench in the Supreme Court.
Accordingly, the Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating into the Treasury bond issue will sit on September 22, 2017 and then will resume on October 2, 2017.
In answer to De Silva PC, ASG Livera pointed out that the AG’s panel assisting the Commission did not only focus on Arjun Mahendran. “We had hundred and one witnesses. Mahendran’s evidence is not the only evidence we are looking at.” De Livera PC said. De Silva PC retorted that the tribunal with all its experience will know that “People just don’t get up and say we can’t cross examine.”
Chairman of the Commission, Supreme Court Judge, Justice K.T. Chitrasiri said that the tribunal is ready to examine Mahendran if necessary.
Meanwhile, Romesh de Silva PC yesterday completed leading evidence through former Governor Arjun Mahendran. De Silva PC will re examine Mahendran following the cross examination.
While giving evidence before the Commission yesterday, Mahendran said that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe gave directives to look into the best possible and profitable methods of raising funds for the government between Private Placement and Auction method. He then said that the Monetary Board was informed of the suggestions by February 23, 2015. He also said that there was a meeting on February 24, 2015 regarding the same.
Mahendran explaining his discussion at the Monetary Board regarding a productive auction method, said that he informed the MB that Private Placement method has been falling short on its objective. “So I said from a practical point of view Private Placement method is not doing its job.” he explained.
Romesh De Silva PC: So on March 6,2015, you conveyed to the Monetary Board that Treasury bonds should be sold through auction method?
Arjun Mahendran: Yes.
RSPC: Was the transferring of any Central Bank officers done by you was in the view of helping Perpetual Treasuries Limited?
AM: No.
RSPC: Did you transfer any Central Bank officer in view of helping you in any ways?
AM: No.
RSPC: Did you transfer any Central Bank officer in view of helping Arjun Aloysius in any ways?
AM: No.
RSPC: Have you gained in any ways from issuing Treasury Bonds?
AM: Not at all.
Meanwhile, Harsha Fernando, the legal representative of retired Deputy Governor P. Samarasiri cross examined Arjun Mahendran yesterday. Retired DG Samarasiri was the ex-officio Tender Board Chairman when the February 27, 2015 auction took place.
In his cross examination, Fernando pointed out that DG Samarasiri was one of the two Tender Board members who were not aware of the two significant events which took place on the February 27, 2015 morning, prior to the Tender Board meeting held on the said date.
The events were the removal of 5% penal rate and the acceptance of 10.5 billion bids at the auction. The 5% penal rate removal came in as a decision from Market Operation Committee while the recommendation on 10.5 billion came from the Public Debt Department. Fernando observed that Mahendran suggested both these decisions to the MOC and PDD respectively.
Fernando said of the eight members of the Tender Board, three were in the MOC and another three in PDD which makes only Assistant Governor Sepala Ratnayake and Tender Board Chairman P. Samarasiri were unaware of these events until the commencement of the Tender Board meeting on 27 February 2015. Mahendran answered in affirmative to the questions.
Fernando then questioned Mahendran if it is correct to suggest that a Central Bank Governor, with his wide executive powers, makes a suggestion, and if the reasons given by him seem acceptable, the subordinate officers are to agree with the suggestion. Mahedran said it is not exactly the case, and went on to say that his were only suggestions which could have been questioned if necessary. Mahendran, on the February 27, 2015 Tender Board decision to accept 10.5 billion, said he was in fully agreement with.
Meanwhile, the Commission yesterday (19) issued an order seeking explanations from Mahendran on the data of two mobile phones in a particular time period, which cannot be located by the investigators. The order seeks explanation for questions including, the mobile phone connection numbers which was/were used by Mahendran during 01.01.2015 to 01.04.2015, in particular what phone was used between 23.02.2015 to 01.03.2015, what are the mobile phone devices and the corresponding IMEI numbers of such devices used by Mahendran during the aforesaid period and have Mahendran provided the aforesaid mobile phones to the Commission.
It also asks Mahendran if he has any explanation to provide for information being absent pertaining to the use of the mobile phones submitted by him to the Commission, pertaining to a considerable time period.
