Curtains raise for Stormy Weather: No storm in a teacup

Mystery, murder and thrillers are the flavor of the season. Leave it to Jehan Aloysius to rekindle a new and improved version of his Gratiaen Prize nominated murder mystery Stormy Weather. The stage play which features both live action as well as filmed scenes is set to go on boards the Lionel Wendt Theater from March 24 to 26 at 7.30 pm.
Stormy Weather will be presented as a black and white movie, set in the late 1940’s world of film noir. The plot revolves around the shocking murder of Noel Richards and the subsequent investigation by a rather unorthodox and nameless inspector.
Q: How does this year’s production differ from the Stormy Weather staged in 2009?
A: The new production is has been revised and restaged for the Lionel Wendt. The characters are more larger than life, and the humour is heightened. In fact it’s quite a different beast to the previous show. The new actors and the portrayal has dramatically altered the rhythm and vitality of the show. Theatre is always alive and organic, never static like movies. The energy is quite palpable and rich.
Q: Why did you think the audience is in the mood for a murder mystery?
A: I believe that Stormy Weather is a unique theatrical experience. I believe it’s something that audiences will appreciate since it’s change from the usual comedies and musicals. The play is remarkably short, at just 70 minutes, though it’s packed with emotion, witticisms and engaging characters. I believe the audiences would appreciate the detail and style of the show just as much as the performance and script.
Q: What kind of audience will go for Stormy Weather?
A: Theatre lovers over the age of 13 years of age ideally (due to the theme of murder), but also film buffs and those who enjoy detective novels and fiction.
Q: What inspired you in writing the script?
A: The script was actually written as a result of a dream I had in 1995. The characters were very different but I wrote this over several days on the old typewriter I used to hammer out my early scripts on.
The script has evolved and the characters have become richer with years (decades) of rewriting and fine tuning. I never dreamt I would be staging it in many forms, including definitive form, 22 years later.
Q: How did you adapt the style of the film noir movies into a stage drama?
A: Film Noir, or Dark Cinema, is a genre that was popular in the mid 1940’s - 1950’s for detective movies produced in Hollywood.
There was a great influence of European styles, but the genre generally included stock characters such as brooding detectives and seductive femme fatales. The films were in black and white, with high contrast, dramatic lighting and shadows. So expect all these elements in our show.
I believe that Stormy Weather is like experiencing a film noir movie in 3D. But it’s more than merely transplanting the 2D film into the 3D realm of the stage. The stage also allows the audience to discover a third dimension to the characters, since these characters have an opportunity to try and break the archetypal ‘roles’ they are cast as in the world of film noir.
Q: Does it feature the original cast of the drama? Tell us a bit about the cast and the characters that they play.
A: To be honest, the new manifestation of Stormy Weather will feature both the original and new cast of the show, through some magic! You will have to see it to find out. However, Amesh De Silva will be reprising his role as Noel Richards which he originated in 2009. The other roles are played by experienced actors from the English language theatre scene, including young Dino Corera, who was actually a production assistant on the original show. Dmitri Gunatilake, Piorina Fernando, Kavitha Gunesekare and little Atira Bandaranayke play their roles with panache. It’s been a challenge to train the cast in the particular genre, but they have achieved my expectations. There is a great deal of style and detail I require for each character as this is a period and genre drama.
Q: You act in as well as direct your productions.
A: I love both acting and directing, but I believe it’s best not to act in one’s own shows. The only reason I’ve acted in any of my shows is due to my having to step in to play a role due to some casting issue. I do enjoy playing some roles though. However, it’s always best to have a clear vision of the play from beyond the stage. It’s tough to judge rhythm, staging and the overall big picture while being onstage. Thankfully, this is one show I have never had to step into a role for.
Q: What makes Story Weather academic material?
A: The script was included in my collection of plays which was shortlisted for the Gratiaen Prize for literature for the year 2000. The script was also staged by DramSoc of the University of Colombo in 1999 as a very different show that didn’t include film. The script has been studied by students and the speeches quoted as well. The show’s women tend to take on a feminist stance as well though their interactions with the males in the play. There are many layers to the script which can be unpacked and discussed. However, I would be giving too much of the plot away if I divulge any more.
Q: What has CenterStage Productions been up to and what are your plans for the future after Stormy Weather?
A: This is the 16th year for CentreStage Productions. That’s 16 years of creating original, homegrown theatre in Sri Lanka! I’m humbled that we have created so many groundbreaking projects that have been featured in the foreign media and travelled the world in that time.
It’s also my 21st year as a director for the public stage. To celebrate this, we are staging a revised new edition of Rag - The Musical in November this year. I have already started work on it with my core unit of actors I am training. We are also casting for new young singers, dancers and actors to develop and grow with us, so we would like them to get in touch with us. We can give them an opportunity to join our dance and musical based youth projects planned for the next two years. The Rag project will also be coupled with workshops on bullying and ragging in schools and educational institutions.
An important note though, is that we sadly receive little or no support from corporate entities for our homegrown theatre work or humanitarian projects. We generally fund the shows ourselves now and cover our costs through the reasonable priced tickets. We would encourage audiences to support original theatre and literature so theatre and culture in Sri Lanka can thrive!
