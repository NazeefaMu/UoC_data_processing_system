Indo Lanka FTA to benefit Lanka’s apparel sector

Proactive measures could further improve Sri Lanka’s annual apparel exports to India which currently stands at US$ 70 million with a significant scope of growth, Apparel Exporters’ Association Chairman Felix Fernando said.
Sri Lanka annually imports close to US$ 60 million worth of yarn and US $ 300 million of fabric from India.Fernando said the removal of non tariff barriers and all other loopholes in the Indo - Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement will also help improve imports and exports between many others sectors in both countries.
The Sri Lankan apparel industry currently employs half a million Sri Lankans and provides 44 percent of all manufactured goods exported by the country.
Fernando was speaking at the inauguration of IIT Expo 2017-(India International Textiles Expo-Colombo 2017) organised by the Powerloom Development and Export Promotion Council (PDEXCIL) (under Ministry of Textiles, Government of India) at the Galadari Hotel, Colombo yesterday. As part of export promotion activities, PDEXCIL has organised this Buyer Seller Meet (BSM) at Colombo, which is held on March 27 and 28.The event will be an opportunity to interact the stakeholders of textiles in both country and develop business opportunities on mutual benefit.
Sixteen Indian exhibitors are displaying their products in this two day event which is an unique opportunity for manufacturers and exporters to showcase their products before Sri Lankan buyers to interact with them and explore business relations and export opportunities.
This is in line with the Government policy of boosting exports from small and medium manufacturers of India. Exhibitors from various state clusters of India with their specialty products are participating in the event.
