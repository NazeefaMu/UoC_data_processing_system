I accepted SLFP Chairmanship to work for country’s prosperity: President

President Maithripala Sirisena noted that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Chairmanship was accepted by him not to crown any of his family members but to lay the foundation in ushering a prosperous future for the country.
The President added that he never appointed his son illegally to any post of the Youth Force or any other youth front misusing powers of the Presidency.Unlike the past, even his son was amongst the gathering and not given a seat on the stage.President Sirisena was addressing the National Youth Convention of the SLFP at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium yesterday. The National Youth Convention was held under the patronage of President Sirisena after a lapse of 13 years.
The convention, which was held on a grand scale was attended by thousands of youths from all parts of the country. The President also launched the official website of the National Youth Front at the convention.
President Sirisena further added that the government never hesitates to take action against corrupt politicians. A clean, honest and honest political force has become a timely need of the country.
“Youths and the entire community as well feel the political thirst of having such a clean, honest and active political force,” the President noted.
President Sirisena further added that if any politician tries to fill his pockets with illegal money collected through monetary misconduct or through misusing state and public resources, he would never hesitate to take tough action against those responsible for such misdeeds without considering the political status.
The President questioned as to why he is being obstructed by certain persons to taking the party forward,after he was offered the SLFP Chairmanship.
The President pointed out that a SLFP government can be formed with the assistance of leftist and progressive forces. The President invited youths to come forward by providing their leadership and contribution at the future Local Government lection. He added that he hopes the Local Government elections can be held in this year.
The great successfulness of the Youth Convention is considered as a source of strength in furthering the SLFP’s future endeavours.
