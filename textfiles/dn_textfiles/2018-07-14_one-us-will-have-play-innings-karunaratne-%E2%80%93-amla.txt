One of us will have to play an innings like Karunaratne – Amla

GALLE, Friday: South Africa’s most experienced batsman and former captain Hashim Amla said that one of the batters in the side has to play an innings like Dimuth Karunaratne for them to have any chance of winning or saving the first Test against Sri Lanka played at the Galle International Stadium.
South Africa find themselves on the back foot after being bowled out for their lowest total against Sri Lanka – 126 and trail the hosts by 272 runs at the end of the second day.
“272 on that type of wicket is a lot of runs. If we manage to restrict them to say 320, then certainly that would be a good target for us.
If a couple of us have a good partnership and one of us plays like the way Karunaratne played, that would get us close to that score,” said Amla at the end of the day.
On a difficult wicket Karunaratne has proved to be the most successful batsman from both sides scoring 158 not out in the first innings and following it up with 60 in the second.
The next highest score in the match so far is South African captain Faf du Plessis’ knock of 49.
Amla said that as one of the top order batsmen he had a big role to play in the second innings. “Any of the batsmen in the top six would like to occupy the crease for a long time and get us close to the total we have to chase. We want to get stuck in and bat for as long as possible,” said Amla. “As we’ve seen it’s been a tough pitch for both teams. When we bowled in the first innings their opener batted exceptionally well.
Karunaratne played an excellent knock, which basically got them the score they got to. It’s a tough wicket. You’ve got to try and capitalise on the loose balls when you do get them. And certainly hope that the ball doesn’t have your name on it - caught behind, or whatever the case is. You’ve always got to have intent when you’re batting,” he said.
“You’ve got to have a decent defence to keep out the good ball, and you’ve got to look to score. If you can combine those two with a bit of fortune here and there, that gives you the best chance.”
DILRUWAN – SOUTH AFRICA’S NEMESIS
As he had performed four years ago, Dilruwan Perera was again proving to be South Africa’s main adversary capturing four wickets for 46 as their batsmen crumbled against spin.
In the 2014 series against them Perera took 16 wickets (avg. 23.12) in two Tests to win the Man of the Series award so what so special against South Africa? “There is nothing special as such. But we have realized that South Africa don’t play off-spin too well.
That has been evident in their last few series. Maybe that is one reason why I have been successful against them,” said Perera.
“We were trying not to let the batsmen settle. You have to keep changing the angles and Rangana (Herath) even changed ends.
If the wicket is turning, I tend to change those angles,” he said.
Perera said Sri Lanka didn’t expect to get South Africa out so cheaply in the first innings.
“We wanted to take a lead. We stopped easy runs put pressure and got the wickets early. Things went on pretty well I thought. We didn’t expect to get them bowled out for 126,” said Perera.
“When the ball is new, the ball pitches and turns a lot and when it gets softer it stops turning.
That’s why we decided to stick to the spinners in the morning.”
Commenting on the state of play Perera said: “It is still the second day of the match. It is not the usual Galle wicket.
It spins from one area only and not like what the usual Galle wicket provides. We have three more days and it will deteriorate further I feel.”
