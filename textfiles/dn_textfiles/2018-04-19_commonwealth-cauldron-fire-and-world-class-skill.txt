Commonwealth cauldron of fire and world class skill

Sri Lanka’s trip to sunny Australia and the Commonwealth Games had all the makings of a gladiator weekend...with tons of hope for our tuskers against Fiji, Wales and Uganda.
Could there be step up performance from our young brigade? What are the chances of some surprised spectator interest to get our performance off the ground?
Our basics, on how to deal with Olympic champion Fiji, stand up to Wales and grab Uganda with our young speed merchants free to express themselves..?
Burning questions that demand answering.
The boys stuttered with Fiji and were outgunned by Hong Kong 7s champions without much counter.....a win that sapped our energy and affected the next opportunity.
Wales were setting up and ran well for their 53 points.
Much anticipation for some heartwarming rugby skills from our islanders against Uganda....
But the reality was a real baptism of fire and hard graft for Muthutanthri, Danushka Ranjan, Soori and Co to get amongst the tries.
Here was that chance to define our rankings and grab some reputation.
Our islanders rugby future has always been in 7s and setting out that hugely needed professional structure with central contracts and the whole 7 yards?
Fundamental to all Sri 7s and the massive input so far...is natural skill, pace and relentless stamina that defies logic and science.
I am hesitant on all 3 counts, knowing the quality of the squad ...same story with our levels of experience.
The massive search for real pace that gives Fiji, England, NZ, and South Africa...will be our Sri quest for fire ....and we live in great hope that day dawns soon.
What scintillating joy to nurture and blood a Carlin Isles and a Perry Baker for Sri ...or a Cecil Africa....?
What magical joy for us Sri islanders to run out ...skill bubbling away and eager adrenaline to break defence at will....for support and blistering pace, anyway you dream it.
In all honesty...we accept our current status as a matter in progress...and wish president Seneviratne, chief executive Ekanayake, Director Gunaratne ...and the team at Sri Lanka Rugby...the sharpest learning so far plus plenty of young raw pace to boost our reserve.
Hope the investment falls on fertile plans that net talent from all corners of our resplendent island.
The Commonwealth Games ...a stark indication of our total lack of forward planning as a nation...with purpose and necessary investment in human talent.
We need to wise up and dedicate our resources for that singular ambition....the government of the people ...should support them to succeed.
The passion for sport an ideal means to win hearts and stride boldly into the new millennium.
Challenge the world and rewrite history ...is a wonderful poster for “New Sri” and the way beyond our horizons.
Time for the rugby family to accept our current state and unite for a defined formidable future ...with all the negative thinking cast out to drift upon our oceans.
Sri rugby is starring down the barrel of upgrading to world class...and 7s is our balance for that remarkable future.
Look no further than Kenya and the intoxicating talent they have produced in the last 5 years.
Take the case of those American Eagles, then absorb the skills of Portugal and Spain on the world circuit.
The time to support Sri islanders 7s is now ...the future is stronger, faster, more skilled and full time pro players that inspire the globe.
Bula bula Sri Api!
