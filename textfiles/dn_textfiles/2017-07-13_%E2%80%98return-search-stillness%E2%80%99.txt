‘RETURN:  in Search  of Stillness’

The British Council Sri Lanka is the Principal Sponsor behind Colombo Art Biennale’s upcoming contemporary Sri Lankan art exhibition at the famed Edinburgh Fringe titled RETURN: in Search of Stillness from August 2 to September 24 at the Sciennes Gallery, at Summerhall. This project marks the latest venture in a prevailing partnership between CAB and the British Council, and also speaks to the British Council’s longstanding commitment to supporting the development of the arts from Sri Lanka internationally.
Through its involvement, the British Council Sri Lanka has been integral in allowing the work of 13 emerging and established CAB artists to receive deserved recognition at what is the world’s largest and most visited arts festival – an opportunity that will boost the prominence of and create opportunities for the Sri Lankan arts as a whole.
Colombo Art Biennale has been fortunate to have the support of British Council Sri Lanka since its inception in 2009. In 2014, the British Council brought down a component of its Homelands exhibit to be showcased as part of 3rd Biennale. It featured more than 49 works by 20 of the world’s leading British contemporary artists from the British Council Collection.
This was then followed by British Council’s instrumental support in securing Assemble - winners of the prestigious UK visual arts Turner Prize - to run a critical part of the Colombo Art Biennale’s developing community engagement programme in Slave Island. The programme was a success, with enthusiasm from the community and Assemble to see a continuation of engagement at CAB 2018.
Regarding their motivations to get involved in CAB’s foray in Edinburgh Fringe, British Council Sri Lanka’s Arts Manager Tanya Warnakulasuriya elaborates in a press release, ‘This exhibition is the perfect choice for this year’s Edinburgh Fringe Festival which is also its 70th anniversary.
The festival itself came about following the end of World War II as a way to use arts to raise the spirits of the war-torn British people. Sri Lanka’s ‘RETURN’ programme shows how Sri Lanka’s artists have also used their skills and talents to chart Sri Lanka fragile peace and the inevitably rocky road to recovery.
It is a poignant reminder of the power that art has to challenge, question and shine a light on the very essence of peacetime in our world today.
It is thrilling that an estimated 98,000 visitors to Summerhall from all over the world will experience the work of some of our most talented artists this August. This is the kind of exposure that our young artists need so that they can develop their talents further in order to be recognized as global players the way other Asian artists are now being viewed. It is great to be a part of that.”
