Poetry is joy forever

I am no pundit on poetry. To me, poetry is a beautiful collection of words. Kavi or Kaudihai gives relaxation, enlightenment and absolute peace of mind. It also helps in meditation poetry comes in many a name and could take us down memory lane to bring before our minds eye, events sad, happy sad, happy, enlightening, historical and soothing.
A poem could be called a story. It could consist of just two lines or many. They give us absolute joy when reading them, “Ba ba black sheep have you any wool? or “Maa Veni Blinda” are immortal lines we have learnt when we began our sojourn into the gesture. All countries on this planet have nursery rhymes composed with beautiful words and rhymes, in their respective languages.
Holy scriptures have been written in verse. The Vedhas, Dharamada, The Bible, the Quaran, Mannimaidhai, Mahabatatha and our own Mahawense have poetry in their manuscripts. The great epics were in verse. Homers Illiyad, 'Odessy', 'Ramayana' with our own Ravena and Bharath Rama as the main personalities kept the world enthralled. Sitha as the heroine.
Actually a poem makes a long story short without changing the gist. A poem is a listenable, loving, lilting, literary legend ancient architectural engraving have shown us that poetry was with our ancestors writings on papyrus had astrological predictions incstibad. Remedies for ailments, symptoms of ailments had been painstakingly written oriole- leaves by our Vedamahatmayas of yester year. All in poetry with its rhyming alliterations and metre.
Poetry to me, is lovely imagination. Treie, it is books that are the ladders that take us from in fancy to the very apex of learning. Poetry does the same in a more dramatic form. Prophet Homammeds words “seek knowledge from cradle to grave' are for all time, Poetry makes us to seek this knowledge mart reverently. Poetry, brings to us what thoughts of the poet.
The verses in our old books the 'sivwpada' 'Malay maley aya naa mala kada vereng aththa bindai paya buruleng thaba vereng” or the tear jerking “badagini vela maa giya kala puthu geta puththe kiri dunnay mama numbata?”
The sagatious poet has his reasoner is writing this verses. It happens even now. It was just a handful of rice then. Today, fiew mothers have to bag for a handful or rice from those going to places of worship while seated on the pavement. Again koppemana gune kelath, dudhano novethi yahapath” reminds us of Shakespeare' 'blow blow thou wintry wind, thou art not so unkind as mans ingratitude. These sayings are for all time.
Beauty is a vital component in poetry. Keat says thing of beauty is a joy forever. May I delve into this thing called 'beauty' ever so present in the English language.
Many are so very prophetic and thought provoking.
Tennysens for men may come and men may go, but I go on forever says “the brook” Tennyson little realised the men who come and go have done to our sweet “Brooks” Shakespeare incorporated a few lines in Julius Caesar that make readers to siglr “spirit of caesar be still I killed not thee with half so good a will. Then again “Gilded tombs do worms enfold, havent you heard that off be told”. How true Dilsend siyalla ran noway”. His seven stages of men are for all time the bards plays always ended with two lines that rhymed. “There never was a tole of such woe. Than that of Juliot and her Romeo”. “Water water everywhere, but not a drop to drink says the ancient Mariner in Coleridge. Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner” frightening lines that could very soon be a reality to humans animals and blants. Gossiping end slander by women is made into just one line by Alexander Pope with every word a reputation falls.” Beautiful lines in Ulysses “to strive to seek to and not to yield. Howe money of us strived to seek and find but have had to yield due to politics and threats.
Shelly's sweet lines 'If winter comes, can spring be for behind' “They are lines that give us hope, faith and the ups end downs in life's journey. Yes at times a cry of pain is the precursor or do a cry of joy to a lovely mother on seeing a new born. D.H. Lawrence who shook the literary world with lady's chatters lover, goes into the very depths of ones conscience in his poem 'The snake' when his 'education' tells him to kill the venomous snake, but his heart tells him not to. He bows to his heart. Both leave the well quenching their first after the 2004 tsumani.
On 24 December the muddy, murky, meandering, merciless murderous mermaids mansions manoeuvres made man to ponder, As to why this salubrious, soothing, saumiya, sea shell scattered sustinence showering, sunrise splashing serenading sea threw all on its way literally asunder.
The above liens are full of emotion. All in rhyme, alliteration and metre.
Of all these lines of wisdom. I think that the words of Thomas Grey in his elegy are gems Full many a gem is buried beneath the its lustre unseen. Full many a flower is blooms in the desert air unseen yes chill penury make some of our brightest humeri germs to whither away in the remote areas. However our blessed gem of an isle can be proud of a bevy of bright rural gems to glitter with the greats of the world.
Again a poignant thought of Gray,” it is every mortals wish that there be someone to shed a tear by his bier, be the former person be a pavement dweller of a king.
