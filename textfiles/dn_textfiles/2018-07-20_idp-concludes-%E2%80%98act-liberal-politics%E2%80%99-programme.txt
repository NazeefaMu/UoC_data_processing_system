IDP concludes ‘Act Liberal Politics’ programme

The Institute of Democracy and Leadership (IDP) recently concluded the annual ‘Act Liberal Politics’ programme held under the theme ‘Individual Freedom/Individual Liberty’ for the third consecutive year, in collaboration with the Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom (FNF).
This year’s two-day programme discussed various aspects of the core theme, with the participating political activists, young political aspirants, members of local governments as well as members of the Liberal Youth Guild, which is the youth arm of the IDL. The FNF, which has been a trusted partner of IDL for 20 years along with the IDL, jointly funded the programme.
Commenting on the key objective of the programme, IDL Programme Convener and Co-Director Shan Yahampath said, “This day and age calls for far-sighted, knowledgeable and active political participation from young professionals. The current socio-economic status quo of Sri Lanka requires such individuals to convene and work towards a more stable political culture that can act as a solid platform for economic growth.”
“‘Act Liberal Politics’ is our contribution to educate young political aspirants on topics such as the free market economy, rule of law, new enterprise creation and entrepreneurship, and consequently form a group of alternative opinion leaders,” he added.
The ‘Act Liberal Politics’ programme facilitated a number of in-depth discussions on timely topics such as the current economic situation in Sri Lanka, the nature of trade agreements, and the ongoing digital transformation (economy). While each topic covered different areas, the overall tone of each session on ‘Ruthless Leaders in History’ illustrated how actions of such leaders impacted the individual freedom of citizens.
The facilitators and the panel of experts at ‘Act Liberal Politics’ consisted of a number of prolific thought leaders in Sri Lanka as well as prominent members of the IDL.
Nalaka Gunawardena, author of Digital Transformation in Sri Lanka, conducted a session on the challenges and opportunities in digital transformation in the Sri Lankan context. Disarmament and Development Forum Coordinator Vidya Abhya Gunawardena conducted a session on the topic of ‘Introduction to Arms Trade treaty – a Liberal Perspective.’
IDL Co-Directors Shyamila Perera, Sandun Gamage, Saminda Jayasekara, and Prabath Theja also facilitated a number of sessions during the two-day programme.
