Worked towards inter-religious harmony: Sampanthan

I am deeply saddened by the sudden demise of most Venerable Professor Bellanwila Wimalarathana Thera who rendered an immense service to the Buddha Sasana as well as the educational and social sectors of the country, Leader of the Opposition R. Sampanthan, MP stated in a message of condolence.
The message added: “After receiving a Bachelor of Arts Degree from the University of Vidyalankara, Kelaniya in 1965, he obtained a doctorate in Philosophy from the University of Lancaster in United Kingdom and held the position of Chancellor of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura until his demise. Wimalarathana Thera rendered a unique service to the field of education, holding various positions such as Professor, Associate Professor, Lecturer and visiting lecturer at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura.
Being Anunayaka of Kotte Sri Kalyani Samagri Dhamma Maha Sanga Sabha of Shyamopali Nikaya, his immense contribution to propagate Buddhism throughout the world would be marked indelibly in the history of this country. Ven Thera wrote several Buddhist books and bequeathed them for the social and religious advancement.
His unexpected demise caused an irreparable loss to the country. As the Leader of the Opposition of Parliament, I express my heartfelt condolence and join all sorrowing ones. May he attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana.”
