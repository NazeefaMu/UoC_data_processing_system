Justice Nawaz’s writ petition
Two Judges decline to take Bench

Two Supreme Court Judges among a three-judge-Bench yesterday declined to sit on the Bench regarding the writ petition filed challenging the Bribery Commission's decision to file a corruption case in the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court against former Chief Justice Mohan Peiris and two others.
When the writ petition came up before Supreme Court three-judge-Bench comprising Justice Sisira de Abrew, Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya and Justice Murdu Fernando, two judges Justice Sisira de Abrew and Justice Murdu Fernando declined to sit on the Bench regarding the writ petition citing personal reasons.
This petition will be taken up again on June 1.
On February 26, the Supreme Court had issued an Interim Order preventing the Bribery Commission’s Director General from taking any further steps against former Chief Justice Mohan Peiris in the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court. Meanwhile, the Bribery Commission had also filed an application in the Supreme Court seeking an order suspending the operation of the SC Interim Order dated February 26, 2018 preventing the Bribery Commission’s Director General from taking any further steps against former Chief Justice Mohan Peiris in the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court.
On January 18, the Bribery Commission filed a corruption case in the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court against former Chief Justice and former Attorney General Mohan Peiris, Court of Appeal Judge A.H.M.D. Nawaz and former Secretary to the Ministry of Power and Energy M.M.C. Ferdinando.
This is over an allegation that they conferred a wrongful or unlawful benefit, and favour or advantage on the perpetrators who had been accused of misappropriating funds belonging to Lanka Electricity Company (Private) Limited (LECO).
