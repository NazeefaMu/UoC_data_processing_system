Former Blood Bank Directress’ case fixed for trial

The corruption case filed against former National Blood Centre Directress Dr. Mangalika Bindusara was yesterday fixed for trial by the Colombo Chief Magistrate's Court.
This is regarding a case which involved the importing of outdated blood plasma filtering units and issuing them for use in 2008.
When the matter came up before Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake, the first witness in the case was advised to appear in court on the next trial date.
The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed a case against former Blood Bank Directress for causing financial loss to the government when importing outdated blood plasma filtering units and issuing them for usage.
