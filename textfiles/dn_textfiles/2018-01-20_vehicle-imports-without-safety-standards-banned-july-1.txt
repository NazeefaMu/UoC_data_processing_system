Vehicle imports without safety standards banned from July 1

The importation of vehicles without seat belts, air bags and anti-locking breaking system (ABS) would be prohibited from July 1 as per the budget proposals for this year.
Finance and Mass Media Ministry sources said although this measure had to be implemented since January 1 this year. It was decided to postpone the date of implementation on the request of the motor vehicle importers and manufacturers.
The Finance and Mass Media Ministry said the importers and manufacturers asked for a considerable period of time to make required adjustments to comply with the proposed emission standards and safety measures.
Accordingly, importation of motor vehicles, which are below emission standards of the Euro IV or its equivalent and not compiled with the required safety standards, would totally be prohibited.
According to the standards, the vehicles which do not carry air bags for driver and front seat passenger,Anti-locking Breaking System (ABS) and three–point seat belts for driver and passengers traveling front and rear seats, except for the middle seat would not be allowed to be imported.
The Finance Ministry also said that since rescheduling of the implementation has been made based on the industry representations, the dealers, importers and manufacturers are strictly advised to refrain from establishing any Letter of Credit (LC) for import of motor vehicles, which would not comply with the specified standards and safety standards with an estimated arrival date after July 1, 2018.
Ministry sources also said that further details on the implementation of the new standards for vehicles, including the types of vehicles will be notified by the respective implementation agencies shortly.
