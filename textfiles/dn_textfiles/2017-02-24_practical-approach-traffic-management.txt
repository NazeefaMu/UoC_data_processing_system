A practical approach  to Traffic Management

Sri Lankan working population is very badly in need of rapid transport modes to reach their work destinations in a much reduced time span and also to get back after the office hours within the shortest possible time to be with their families and also to relax after a hard days work, possibly with some entertainment added to the relaxation.
However, both the public and private sector staff are finding it extremely impossible to get the much needed relaxation mainly due to traffic congestions mainly in Colombo and extending to other major towns on the borders of Colombo.
This is mainly due to excessive number of vehicles on the road, non working of signal lights, inefficient traffic control by traffic policemen, excessive numbers of pedestrians crossing roads, reckless and selfish drivers, lower penalties on offending drivers, vehicle breakdowns, accidents and a number of other factors.
Japanese businessmen always endeavor to house their office and residence at the same location so that they do not have to waste time on the road coming to their work places and getting back saving precious time adding to their daily productivity levels.
In our country, vehicle owners spend considerable time on the road for unproductive travel also. Most of advanced countries utilize the high speed rail network with the using of so called bullet trains to transport the office workers from distances of over 400 kilometers also at times. The working population hardly feel the time passing as they are quite comfortable inside the trains. In Thailand, the use of rivers for transportation has become popular and convenient.
The famous Chao Pryar river is the best example. The main reason for traffic congestions is the centralization of almost all top offices in the main cities or in the capital cities of countries. Good examples are Colombo, Mumbai, New York, London, Bangkok and many other major towns all over the world. With the ever rising working population, the major cities are facing the problem of traffic management throughout the day. In some countries even the directors and top management come to office by using motor cycles as the motor cyclists resort to driving along the pavements as well to reach their destinations in time.
In Sri Lanka some of the practical examples are highlighted below. The traffic jams occur in all roads from Colombo to outstations and Colombo suburbs especially in the afternoon. The most notable roads are from Colombo to Moratuwa, Homagama, Ja-Ela and Kadawata. At times it may well take two hours to reach Moratuwa from the Colombo city. The problem aggravates during rainy days. The drivers and passengers are facing the agony of spending over 3 to 4 hours on the road coming to work and getting back. However, it may be possible to reach Chilaw in 90 minutes with imaginative driving. Trains are frequently used by office workers coming to Colombo from outstations as there are no worries of traffic congestions.

The only problems for them is the sudden cancellation of trains due to union action and the non availability of adequate seats due to over crowding. A visit to Kandy may well take over four hours after 5 P.M. with vehicles entering the main road from access roads and lanes. For a very long time, the traffic problems keep haunting the minds of all office workers.
Successive governments are paying attention to traffic management for a long period but still have not found complete solutions to ease the situation.
Another difficult time for the motorists will be the school closure times with traffic jams prevailing for over one hour. Motorcyclists, Three wheeler drivers, Container transporters and Lorries transporting goods add to the problems by joining the lengthy vehicle queues at peak periods.
I strongly feel that we should employ a separate minister to handle traffic management only, as our productivity levels depend very much on easing traffic congestion. Right now they leave it to the traffic police.
From the point of view of foreign and local investors also traffic blues will be a negative point. Smooth flow of raw materials & finished goods will reduce the transport, handling, loading & unloading costs of their respective business ventures. For example a foreigner going to a hotel in Mount Lavinia area will encounter the traffic jam in the evening and will wonder why a vehicle takes over 90 minutes to cover around 18 kilometers in the Colombo district.
The recent proposed guidelines for three wheeler drivers and for the purchase of three wheelers will no doubt will do a world of good and is very much in the interests of motorists. The three wheeler numbers increased during the last two decades without any regulatory framework to arrest heavy traffic situations. Road rules are violated mainly by the three wheeler drivers. They have been charging passengers exorbutant rates up to now and it would be in public interest to make it mandatory for them to install meters and also to display their identity clearly.
The 25% ceiling on leasing will reduce the owners’ monthly costs for leasing charges and could be easily recovered monthly and there will be a reduction of accidents and road mishaps due to speeding in the eagerness to earn more. The same 25% rate also should have been applied on lorries, buses and all commercial vehicles. So that the monthly leasing charge will come down and the hires also will benefit by way of lower charges.
The rate per kilometer should be Rs.30 at a realistic level even after providing for lost mileage on running. Like in Singapore taxi stands be erected in Colombo and other major cities closer to bus stands so the travellers will have the option of going in the bus or in a metered taxi. Metered taxis will also include the proposed cars run on electricity. There should not be any further delays in implementing this programme. The objectives would be many fold, namely,
 
 
1. A lower rate for the travellers, Rs.30 for three wheelers and Rs. 50 for cars run on electricity.
2 .Safety of travellers
3. Reduction of buses plying on Colombo and suburban roads
4. Reduction of air pollution levels
5. Reduction in traffic jams
6. Increased public savings
7. Increased productivity levels in all sectors by reductions in travel times
8. Regular hires for all passenger vehicle owners
9. Lowering of cost of living due to lower
transport costs
 
To make this scheme successful all vehicles coming into this scheme be registered with a private sector managed institution assisted by different mobile phone companies and reputed banks, finance companies and insurance companies so that the supervision will become easier and productive. This scheme will ensure that only the genuine and hard working drivers are retained in public transport and they will be much disciplined due to the fact that they are being monitored.
The rest will turn to other avenues such as construction and manufacturing. Due to the inadequacy of manual labour, the construction industry now pays between Rs.1,000 to Rs.2,000 per worker depending on skill level sometimes with tea and meals. So our youth could be employed in a productive manner to enhance GDP growth. The functions of this private sector managed instituition will include,
 
1. Monitoring of all vehicles entering the main cities and compiling of a data bank on vehicles entering cities frequently or on a daily basis
 
2. Physical observation and control of traffic in all main cities of each district
 
3. Levying of tolls on vehicles entering the cities on a daily basis
 
4. Maintenance of data bases on drivers and provision of training facilities including spoken English
 
5. Imposition of fines on traffic rule violators and even blacklisting of them
 
6. Decisions and recommendations on new vehicle owners joining the daily traffic movements
 
7. All new vehicle registrations
 
8.Training of bus and other passenger transport drivers and crew
 
9. Installation of cameras with overseas/state assistance to nab traffic offenders
 
10. Recommendations for school/office time revisions
 
11. The introduction of sophisticated testing equipment for drunk drivers
 
12. Checking the accuracy of meters of all hiring vehicles
 
13. Prevention of accidents by categorization of drivers.
 
14. Introduction of a token road levy to maintain the road network of the country to be paid equally
by the passengers and the drivers
 
15. Awarding of points for all drivers based on performance
 
16. Monitoring and simplification of work procedures at the department of motor traffic
 
17. Taking steps to further streamlining the leasing procedures and criteria
18. Recommendations on shifting of main public and private sector offices from existing locations to reduce the traffic flow to/from the city
 
19. Compilation of monthly traffic reports for the benefit of policy makers
 
20. Evaluation and study of contemporary practices adopted by other countries to arrest city traffic Congestion and collecting of road levies from motorists
 
21.Taking immeadiate steps to attend to needy repairs to roads and pavements within a matter of hours to ensure smooth traffic flows
 
22. Transport assistance in productivity enhancement in schools, private& public sectors
 
I wish to highlight a number of practical situations where improvements are needed to enhance the efficiency of existing systems and also for environmental protection.
 
1. To avoid formation of large queues to pay the toll at exit points of highways, the drivers should be requested through media to bring the exact amount of cash, especially during weekends where heavy traffic formation is possible.
 
2. Shifting of all shops selling consumer goods, restaurants & barsa few yards back to avoid parking of vehicles by their customers
 
3. Pavement hawkers be assigned a separate place of business to ensure pedestrians do not step into the roads
 
4. All vehicle drivers, conductors and passengers should be banned from chewing betel inside public transport vehicles to avoid instances of spitting on roads and public places
 
5. Separate bus services should be operated for school children, Public sector staff and private sector Staff at different times on a planned time table. In the sixtees there were separate school service Buses run by the central transport board
 
6. For executive staff,a separate executive bus service at a higher fare be also introduced with added Comforts
 
7. Use of 'Dendro Power' for running of buses should be tried to maintain/reduce the existing bus fares as this may well cut down the running costs. This is practiced in many countries
 
8. Looking ahead solar powered buses could be introduced to bring in the green effects for Transportation and to avoid environmental pollution
 
9. Introduction of larger comfortable separate seats in public transport systems will lure the motor car Owners to travel in buses leaving their cars at home. There will be an immeadiate reduction of the number of vehicles on roads
 
10. Beautification of central bus stands and railway stations will also attract more passengers to travel in public transport systems leaving their personal vehicles at home. A project for beautification of railway stations was initiated by the lions movement in 1991 with assistance from the railways department for which the writer assisted as an observer. The Rambukkana station was adjudged as the best station.
 
11.Vendors and others soliciting money from passengers be totally banned making the journey a pleasant one for all.
 
12. Turning off from main roads to other sides of the roads at junctions be eliminated to The maximum.A good example is turning of vehicles at “William grinding mills” close to Dehiwala where huge traffic jams are experienced on a daily basis.As an alternative the drivers should be diverted through Hill street at Dehiwala junction to drive towards Nugegoda.
 
13. Construction of additional tracks between railway stations so that trains need not have to stop at stations waiting for other trains to pass, sometimes causing over 30 minute delays.
 
14. Levelling of pavements so that the pedestrians will have smooth and quick walks rather than walking on uneven surfaces taking time
 
15.VIP travel should be minimized on peak hours and video conferencing facilities should be provided for meetings. This is even suitable for the public and private sector also.
 
16. Special walks, processions and trade union/student/other protests be banned by law causing traffic congestions and the protesters should be allowed to protest only at specified venues. This menace has done irreparable damage to our economy and productivity levels.
 
17. Notices on Religious processions and festivals be informed to the public via media days before the events on a daily basis so that motorists will use other routes or leave early
 
18. Speed limits should be strictly adhered to by all motorists and the traffic police should use Speedometers at suspected locations for speeding and charge offenders on the spot
 
19. Metered taxi stands be erected at shopping malls,outside hotels and at main junctions like in Singapore where the scheme has benefitted both the travellers and taxi services. Taxi services will erect the stands and will also pay an agreed sum as the annual licence fee which could be utilized to provide security to taxi stands throughout the day.
 
20. Drainage systems at major junctions of Colombo are still at a deplorable level.Take the case of Armour street junction where a heavy shower for 30 minutes will create water levels of over 10 inches. We had three phases of Greater Colombo flood control projects many years back but still the situation remains the same.
 
21. Repair work on main roads take months and years.The work should be completed within a few days employing a large number of workers.A good example is the current work at Thurstan road.
 
22. The traffic police personnel be rewarded with incentives for ensuring smooth vehicle flows.
The traffic management process will involve,
 
1. The ascertainment of facts and data
2. Physical Observation
3. Introduction of productive changes
4. Progress monitoring
5. Feedback information
6. Innovation and value addition
7. Regular communication via media
8. Strict adherence to the new systems
