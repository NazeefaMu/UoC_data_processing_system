Colombo Bishop urges govt. to follow Court ruling on SAITM

Bishop of Colombo Dhiloraj Canagasabey has called on the government and SLMC to follow the Court of Appeal’s ruling and not deny provisional registration to qualified medical students of SAITM.
“There are many other Sri Lankan students who are able to afford the fees charged by foreign medical schools and who have been registered to practice medicine in Sri Lanka. It is therefore, unjust to deny the same opportunity to SAITM medical students,” he said.
Canagasabey also called for the government and SLMC to study and act on the proposals made by the deans of the eight Medical faculties in order to resolve the ongoing SAITM issue.
“Various issues involved have been set out, discussed and debated in several media conferences, press releases, paper articles, byway of posters, demonstrations, marches, public meetings and even in our parliament. I need not repeat them here since the interested public is well aware of the arguments made for and against SAITM and sufficient information, including a judgement by the Court of Appeal is available in the public domain,” Canagasabey said.
“I approach this issue from the angle of justice and fairness. Firstly, to the students who have been enrolled to follow the MBBS course at SAITM and secondly to the general public who will come under the care of these students once they qualify and get registered as medical practitioners,” he added.
He said, “I believe that students were enrolled for the MBBS degree at SAITM from 2009 onwards and that there is no dispute that this institution was recognized as a degree awarding institution in 2011. Since then, there has been ongoing disagreements with the SLMC and the GMOA about clinical training and finally about the provisional registration of SAITM medical graduates by the SLMC which led tot he Court of Appeal petition.”
Ensuring that students enrolled for medical (or any other degree course) are properly qualified is a matter for the University Grants’ Commission, while ensuring that proper standards are maintained in the teaching of medicine and in clinical training is the responsibility of the SLMC.
In both these areas, the Ministries of Higher Education and Health have an extremely vital role to play, the Bishop added.
“Students who have enrolled at the SAITM are our own, who have pursued their dream of passing out as doctors in Sri Lanka. It is therefore, unjust to deny the same opportunity to SAITM medical students,” he said.
