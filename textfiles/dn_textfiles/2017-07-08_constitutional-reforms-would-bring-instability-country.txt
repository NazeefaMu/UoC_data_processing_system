'Constitutional reforms would bring instability to country'

Constitutional reforms would bring about many disputes and instability in the country, Buddhasasana Karya Sadhaka Mandalaya (BKSM) Secretary Most Ven. Thirikunamale Ananda Mahanayaka Thero said. He said so speaking at a media briefing at the All Ceylon Buddhist Congress premises yesterday. The Thero said that the country did not need Constitutional reforms and it would create a controversial situation in the country.
He also said, “Suspicion arises as to whether the new Constitution will not prioritize Buddhism and conserve it for future generations. Foreign forces seek to restructure the place received by Buddhism in the country and it would only create disputes which would also affect the archaeological value of the country. This would ultimately result in destruction of the country as a whole.”
BKSM President Saddharma Keerthi Sri Thripitakacharya Ven. Diviyagaha Yasassi Nayaka Thero said the Sangha community would fight again to protect the Sinhala Buddhist country and to establish reconciliation among all irrespective of any partiality.
Presidnet’s Counsel Manohara de Silva said that not even one Bhikku or any Buddhist representative had been appointed to any of the steering committees engaged in reforming the Constitution.
The President’s Counsel also said Constitutional reforms would permit the propagation of any religion and it would be a threat to Buddhism as well as to other religions in Sri Lanka. There would also be no limitations to propagate any culture according to Constitutional reforms, he added. Manohara de Silva further said that unity of the country would be adversely affected if the powers would be further delegated to Provincial Councils by the Central Government by Constitutional reforms.
Ven. Balangoda Sobitha Thero, All Ceylon Buddhist Women’s Congress Secretary Kanthi Abeynayake, Damrivi Foundation President Prof. Asanga Thilakeratne, BKSM Members Jagath Sumathipala and Suren Abeyagunawardena also participated.
