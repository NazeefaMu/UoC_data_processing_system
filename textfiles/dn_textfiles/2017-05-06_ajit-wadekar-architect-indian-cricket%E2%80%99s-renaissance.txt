Ajit Wadekar architect of Indian cricket’s renaissance

Indian soil did indeed produce a galaxy of cricketing stars from the moment they trooped on to the Test arena in 1932 - individual brilliance though, provided by such immortal willow wielders such as Merchant, Modi, Mankad, Pataudi Sr, Mustaq Ali, Amarnath and Hazare among others - yet literally they never ever produced a cohesive match winning unit, never a comprehensive series win across the vast horizon - just a couple of Test wins, so few and far between, through the thirties and well into the nineteen sixties.
Paradigm shift it took one Ajit Laxman Wadekar with his “can do - gung ho” Maharastrian mindset to herald the dawn of Indian crickets winnings ways. Initially thrashing Gary Sobers’ maroon caps off their pedestal so to speak, in the Caribbean mind you, in 1971, and then bulldozing the English, first in Old Blighty in 1971, and repeating the feat in the sub continent in 72-73 for good measure.
It was Vijay Mechant, the Indian selector-in-chief who had virtually grabbed the baton from the much fancied, aristocratic, entrenched-in-the-captaincy, Nawab of Pataudi jnr and handed it over to Ajit Wadekar in somewhat controversial circumstances.
On hindsight it was a truly worthwhile gamble was it not. That Ajit Wadekar’s grasp of the grass-root issues and nuances of the game deserved much wider respect, was the astute Merchant’s view.
With a wounded “tiger” licking his wounded pride in the vicinity of his principality in Haryana or thereabouts, Wadekar took it upon his slender young shoulders therein to marshall his somewhat inexperienced cricketing troops, what with his scholarly authority and quiet charm, towards winning ways, the side replete with green sprigs such as Gavaskar, Solkar, Abid Ali, Kirmani, Ashok Mankad, Govindaraj among others.
Remember his beloved Tricolor was wallowing at the bottom of Test cricket’s heap alongside New Zealand at that particular point of time, the whipping boys of the international game, so to speak. Bats over Books to kick of the narrative from its very conception, with Ajit’s scholarly dad Laxman Bhassar having every stoic intention of guiding his left handed offspring to a career in mathematics cum engineering.
Wadekar senior’s hopes were dashed however when his precocious colt doggedly placed precedence on his ‘bats and balls’ over his ‘books and calculators’ and set his young sights on representing his beloved country in the Test arena. Ajit had his skills honed on the weed strewn Shivaji Park, that precious plot of real estate that has spawned an unprecedented assembly line of top class Test cricketers for the Yellow, White and Green colored flag and country. On his way to the top that doyen of cricketing guru’s Joe Kamath had found and fixed Ajit’s flaws. Before all the said hype and hullabaloo, once on a bus ride Indian leg spinner Baloo Gupte who was sitting alongside the future icon had invited little Ajit to make up his tennis ball side as the 12th man. Ajit took up the offer and never looked back.
Much later the youngster came into prominence with a cracking triple century in first class cricket - 323 in 489 minutes with 40 fours, to comprehensively stamp his undoubted class. Strutting his stuff tall, fair, handsome and angular, Ajit had his left handed batting running along textbooks lines, clean and crisp as his bat ran sweetly through the cherry, proceeding to execute his left handed cover drives, square cuts and delectable clips-to-leg off his bootlaces, and then again he would sink onto his left knee and sweep ever so sweetly past square.
As a youngster I remember watching him from the boundary lines of SSC, NCC, CCC or wherever. Strutting his stuff in the slips - he was simply one of the best in that position - Ajit snapped up 46 catches in the 37 Tests and in all first class games, slammed over 15,000 runs and snapped up 271 catches for added measure. Replete with lazy elegance he notched up 2113 Test runs in 37 outings almost always striding in at the pivotal number 3 position.
Have Spin Will Win His key strategy in heralding the dawn of India’s winning ways was to pack his bowling armory with spin - the oh, so dizzying spin of the likes of Bedi, Venkat, Prasanna and Chandrasekhar, intelligently making astute use of the precious commodity that was readily available across the Indian states. Besides which Eknath Solkar fielding within pick-pocketing distance of the batter latched onto some spectacular catches to assist the spin quartet.
Laid back elegance my first brush with the iconic Indian was when my dad Leo dragged me along to the State Bank of India headquarters in Colombo where the left hander was being billeted, and being offered a piece of buttered toast and then another slice off his own plate for good measure - He was a personification of kindness. Then again the great man had the humility to spend a couple of days at our abode on the outskirts of Colombo along with his gracious wife Rekha and three precious children Prasad, Vipul and Kashmira.
Needless to say we were so honored. Mind you he was at the pinnacle of his cricketing career at that point of time. Then again whilst attending a bank symposium for Colombo’s Seylan Bank Plc, conducted at the Taj Lands End Hotel in Mumbai, the Indian great truly honored me with a courtesy call and even snapped a couple of selfies with me.
His loyalty towards, my dad Leo knows no bounds as they still communicate oh-so-frequently across the Palk Straits, My dad having struck up a friendship with him in the early sixties or thereabouts.
In 1974 Ajit’s Indians were comprehensively hammered by the English on English soil. They lost the 3 Test series 3-0 and the 2 ODI’s to boot.
Following which Ajit was dealt with most tardily at best by the then BCCI. Consequently the icon virtually sank without a trace for a long while. That he was pensioned off before his punch and panache ran out is many a pundits view. Mercifully the ex left hander came back with a bang to serve his country, shoveling in tons of sweat back to the game he endorsed in the capacity of selector, coach and team manager. Ajit now spends his time ever so blissfully with gracious wife Rekha and his precious offspring, his trophy cabinet bursting at its seams, the Arjun Award and the Padma Shri Awards taking up the top shelf.
