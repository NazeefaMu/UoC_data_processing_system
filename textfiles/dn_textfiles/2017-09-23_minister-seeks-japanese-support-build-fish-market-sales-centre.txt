Minister seeks Japanese support to build fish market, sales centre

Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, who is currently on an official tour to Japan, sought technical assistance from Japan to build a large fish market and seafood sales centre this year in Kapparatota, Weligama, similar to world-famous Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry sources said.
He made this request during a discussion with the officials of Tokyo Metropolitan after making an inspection tour of the Tsukiji fish market.
The Tsukiji Fisheries Sales Centre, which is located in an area of 230,000 square metres, is the busiest and largest fish market in the world. Around 480 varieties of seafood including tuna and dry seaweed are sold at this market.
Sri Lankan Ambassador to Japan Professor Dhammika Ganganath Dissanayake also participated in the discussion.
