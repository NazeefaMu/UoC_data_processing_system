‘UPFA will get Opposition Leader’s post’

The UPFA will be given the Opposition Leader’s post if its entire membership sits in the Opposition ranks in Parliament. Mahinda Rajapaksa has not voted against any proposal brought in Parliament by Ranil Wickremesinghe. Neither did Mahinda Rajapaksa place his signature for the no-confidence motion brought against Ranil Wickremesinghe, JVP’s Kalutara district Parliamentarian Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said.
He was speaking at an awareness programme attended by JVP activists in Kalutara yesterday.
Dr. Jayatissa said in the event the Opposition Leader’s post was given to the UPFA, the most suitable person to hold that post would be Kumara Welgama because he was the person who said that they should sit in the Opposition without trying to tie up with others to form a coalition or national government. Welgama opposed the assumption of the Prime Minister’s post through the backdoor.
He also opposed all action taken by Ranil Wickremesinghe. Welgama played his cards close to his chest and acted with great foresight and he is the most suitable person to hold the Opposition Leader’s post, he said.
Dr. Jayatissa said the 50-day political conspiracy had how been busted. The Joint Opposition held protest demonstrations against Karu Jayasuriya for his failure to accept Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister. Would the Joint Opposition do the same against the judges who ruled against them during the recent petitions, was a question which begged an answer, he said. Dr. Jayatissa said the Joint Opposition also claimed that the LTTE would raise its head again the moment Mahinda Rajapaksa resigned from the Prime Minister’s post. If that argument was valid, it proved that Gotabhaya Rajapaksa had failed to annihilate the LTTE as boasted by him.
This would make one suspect whether the LTTE tigers were being kept caged at Medamulana and Wijerama Mawatha to be let loose whenever they wanted to, Dr. Jayatissa said.
He said if Ranil Wickremesinghe had any concern for the sacrifices made by the people to make democracy victorious, he should expedite action to penalise the rogues of the Rajapaksa regime without delay.
He alleged that the Ranil-Sagala clique had pampered corrupt individuals of the Rajapaksa regime without taking concrete action against them. Their plan would have been to divide the SLFP and disintegrate it in order to profit by it, Dr. Jayatissa said. As a result of their failure to net the rogues of the Rajapaksa regime, the rogues took hold of the government and executed a 50-day conspiracy, he said.
Dr. Jayatissa said both President Sirisena and Ranil Wickremesinghe should be held responsible for the failure to honour the mandate given by 6.2 million people. He would challenge Ranil Wickremesinghe to set up two more special high courts before January 1 and expedite the high-profile cases against the rogues of the Rajapaksa regime.
Dr. Jayatissa said they were confident that Ranil Wickremesinghe would not act against members of the Rajapaksa family and his own acolytes. He said Mahinda Rajapksa may have relinquished his Prime Minister’s post on an assurance that no legal action would be taken against him regarding alleged corruption cases.
Perhaps that may be a bonus paid to Rajapaksa for allowing Wickremesinghe to stay put at Temple Trees, even without holding the Prime Minister’s post, he said.
Dr. Jayatissa said there were allegations that Sajith Premadasa had spent more than Rs. 300 million of state funds on publicity when he was Housing and Construction Minister.
He said there was no difference between the scenes created by UPFA thugs at Rupavahini and UNP thugs at Lake House following court rulings. How could Mahinda and Ranil discipline the nation when they could not discipline their own followers, he asked.
The resignation of Mahinda Rajapaksa from the post of Prime Minister which was not in force was hilarious. He signed the document amidst the chanting of pirith and drumbeats while his supporters applauded. This reminded us of folklore relating to sour grapes heard during Kindergarten days.
