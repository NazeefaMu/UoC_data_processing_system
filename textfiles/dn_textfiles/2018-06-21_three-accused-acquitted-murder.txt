Three accused acquitted of murder

Panadura Provincial High Court Judge Dhamith Thotawatte acquitted the three accused indicted with committing the murder of L. Lorenzu de Mel and committing the attempted murder of L.V. Luxman de Mel and D. Sirikathu Fernando of Moratuwa by shooting, on January 17, 1999, at Egodauyana Moratuwa.
The judge pronounced the judgement in open court yesterday and stated that the shooting had taken place after the church festival at Egodauyana, Moratuwa, after a heated argument that ensued among them.
Moratuwa Police conducted investigations and arrested the two accused. Subsequently, the Maharagama Police arrested the third accused.
The court recorded the available evidence at the lengthy trial, but there were vital contradictions in the prosecution’s case. The prosecution had not proved the case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt and the court acquitted the three accused from the indictments filed against them by the Attorney General.
Lawyers Sisira Kodikara, S.A. Paul and Samadara Jayasinghe appeared for the accused.
State Counsel Gayani Wegodapola appeared for the prosecution.
