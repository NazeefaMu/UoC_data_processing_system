New hope to control Chronic Kidney Disease

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) in Sri Lanka has been a major public health problem and receiving increased global attention because of a significant increase in the prevalence of the disease. The term “unknown etiology” is referred, because the disease is not associated with any known risk factors such as aging, diabetes, hypertension, and nephrotoxic drug usage but suspected to be environmental causes.
As the CKDu occurs in settlements where groundwater is the main drinking water source, several risk factors had been hypothesized. The major factors that considered for CKD causes were environmental toxins, heavy metals (e.g., Cd, Pb), Fluoride (F), Aluminum (Al), and aluminofluoride (AlFx) complexes in water. But, none of the hypothesis had been scientifically proven and hence a definite cause for CKDu is yet to be revealed.
CKDu-affected areas
While working on CKDu research, I noticed that even among high-CKDu prevalence areas, there are small areas or villages that had not been affected by the disease. In these areas, the water source and quality were distinctly different from the CKDu-affected areas. Therefore, NIFS, under the Ministry of Science, Technology and Research took an initiative to systematically examine the quality of potable water in these locations to assess possible relationships between water quality and the occurrence of CKDu.
The research team at NIFS led by me tested all potable water for common contaminants such as fluoride and metal species Al, Cd, As, Ca and Mg that had previously been considered to be the main external etiological factors of CKDu disease.
Accordingly the NIFS researchers initiated a systematic monitoring programmes of water quality from the sources which used by the CKDu patients regularly. For these investigations, areas which were already identified by WHO as high-risk CKDu regions were further divided into three sub zones according to CKDu prevalence; high-CKDu prevalence areas where the majority of the people living in the region were affected by the disease (Zone I), low-CKDu-prevalence areas where the majority of the people living in the region were not affected by the disease (Zone II); CKDu non-prevalence areas where the people were not affected by the disease (Zone III). They have selected areas where disease free as the control.
WHO recommendations
In high-CKDu prevalence areas, the main drinking water sources were dug or tube well water, while in low-CKDu-prevalence areas, it was mostly dug well water and from water treatment plants. However, in CKDu non-prevalence, (where those isolated pockets are nearby to high-CKDu prevalence areas), the residents used spring water.
As it is highly suspected that the high concentrations of cadmium (Cd), aluminum (Al) and arsenic (As) in drinking water caused for high incidence of CKDu, the trace elements present in the water were also analyzed. Interestingly research carried out by the NIFS scientists found that the Cd levels in drinking water was below the WHO standard (3.0 µg/L ) in both high-CKDu and low-CKDu-prevalence areas while and in control areas, the Cd levels in drinking water was found to be low (0.57–0.64 µg/L).
The lowest Cd concentrations were found from spring waters (in CKDu non-prevalence areas). Therefore, it was unlikely that Cd alone to be considered as a potential risk factor for high CKDu prevalence. It was noticed high fluoride and hardness in drinking water sources in zone I where CKDu prevalence is high and fluoride levels were higher in CKDu prevalence areas than in CKDu non-prevalence areas. Remarkably, in areas where the people are not affected by the disease, the average fluoride level is 0.07 (mg/L) which is much lower than the WHO recommendations.
According to previous research, the zones with high and low CKDu prevalence areas overlap with the high groundwater fluoride terrains of Sri Lanka. These data clearly indicated that people living in high-CKDu prevalence areas had consumed more fluoride than WHO recommended value, and therefore, the presence of the fluoride in drinking water for the prevalence patterns of CKDu incidence is remarkable. However, water quality analysis done by the NIFS researchers, indicates that single element is not responsible for prevalence of CKDu.
As, it was impossible to establish a single causative factor (from among F, Al, Cd, hardness) for the etiology of CKDu, the team proposed a multi-faceted nature of possible causative factor and explicitly existence of a synergistic effect of hardness, F and Cd with the incidence of CKDu based on the statistical analysis. This concept was appeared in a peer reviewed scientific journal titled Environmental Geochemistry and Health (contact NIFS for further details).
The NIFS Research team, with the assistance of researchers at Veterinary Faculty of University of Peradeniya and Veterinary Research Institute at Gannoruwa, conducted animal trials to attest their proposed hypothesis of “synergistic effect of hardness, F and Cd on CKDu”. The first animal trial conducted by the research team to assay the effect of Al, F and AlFx complex on CKDu revealed that the treated drinking water containing F and Al with same level of WHO recommendations or moderately above the WHO levels or AlFx in low level (0.07–15 mg/L) did not lead to CKD in mice.
The second animal trail was conducted to see the synergic effect(s) of heavy metals, aluminium, arsenic, fluoride and hardness in drinking water on kidney tissues of mice.
The histopathological results clearly demonstrated that the mice fed with drinking water containing WHO recommended levels of Cd, F along with hardness, leading to early lesions similar to those of CKD. Severity of the toxicity on kidney was found to depend on the contamination levels as well as their combined effects.
The team finally concludes that a synergic effect(s) especially among Cd, F and hardness of water could lead to severe kidney damage even at WHO recommended or slightly higher (double dose) levels in chronic administrations. By considering its importance, this finding was published in “Scientific Reports” of Nature publisher’s journal in 2017.
