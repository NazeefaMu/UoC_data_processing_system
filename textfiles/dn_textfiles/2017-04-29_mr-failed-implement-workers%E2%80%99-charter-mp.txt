MR failed to implement Workers’ Charter: MP

Galle District UNP MP Wijepala Hettiarachchi said yesterday that MP Mahinda Rajapaksa who brought the Workers’ Charter in 1994 did not implement it even after he had a two-thirds majority and ruled for 10 years. He is now trying to hold the May Day rally for the working class shedding crocodile tears.
Therefore, the former President has no rights whatsoever to represent the working class and speak on behalf of them.
Addressing a media briefing at Sirikotha, Hettiarachchi said what the previous government had did was to allegedly shoot fisherman Anthony during a protest in Chilaw in 2012, demanding for fuel concession. But, t was our government which granted the biggest reduction in the fuel prices.
Private sector worker Roshan Chanaka was allegedly killed during the protest at Free Trade Zone in Katunayake for demanding higher wages and pension scheme. But, when we came to power, we increased the salaries of public servants by Ra.10,000 and private sector workers’ salary by Rs.2,500.
“Today, they are trying to coerce innocent working people to come to Galle Face Green,” he said.
