Ebert Silva Holidays launches open deck city tours in Kandy

Ebert Silva Holidays together with Central Province Tourism, Department of Tourism and Regional Economic Development Agency launched the ‘Kandy City Tour’, the open deck city sightseeing experience in the UNESCO declared World Heritage City and Sri Lanka’s last royal capital, Kandy.
The Kandy City tour was launched by the Central Province Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake in the presence of officials and other dignitaries and many school children opposite the Queens Hotel in Kandy, recently.
Open deck city tours are a distinct feature in every leading tourist destination around the world and will undoubtedly add colour and an enhanced touristic experience in Sri Lanka’s cultural capital, especially with the approaching Esala Perehera season.
The Kandy City Tour open deck coach is artistically branded with elements inherent to the city of Kandy and enables both Sri Lankans and foreign travelers to witness this scenic city with professional commentaries giving details of the city’s history, heritage and highlighting its arts, crafts and architectural importance among others.
Ebert Silva Holidays Chairperson Rajini de Silva Mendis said that the company with a brand name synonymous in Sri Lanka’s travel and tourism industry is indeed proud to have introduced the open deck sightseeing concept and experience to Sri Lanka. Initially, it was introduced in Sri Lanka’s premier city, Colombo, by the introduction of the Colombo City Tour, a venture in collaboration with Sri Lanka Tourism.
She further added that the Kandy City Tour will showcase a leading tourist city not only in Sri Lanka, but in the world, and this service will give a unique opportunity to highlight the beauty and the heritage of a foremost World Heritage City to the world.
The ‘Glimpse of Kandy’, a four-hour tour will be operated daily showcasing the rich heritage and history of this picturesque city with professionally guided tours highlighting the heritage of the Temple of the Tooth Relic Complex including the Royal Palace, Museum and the Bathing Hall.

The tour will include a 20-minute boat ride on the Kandy Lake which will enable the guests to capture a unique scenic view of the city across the serene waters of this man-made lake.
A unique photo opportunity at ‘Arthur’s Seat’, where a panoramic view of the city of Kandy can be seen is also included in the tour with views of the magnificent Buddha Statue on Bahirawakande, the Udawatte Kale and the Temple of the Tooth Complex with its gilded roof seen across the Kandy Lake.
The open deck drive through the Peradeniya University will be another delightful experience travelling through its beautiful landscapes and viewing the magnificent buildings depicting Sri Lankan architectural elements.
Finally, a shopping experience for traditional arts and crafts will complete the open deck tour experience.
The ‘Heritage of Kandy’ tours operated on weekends in air-conditioned coaches will showcase the arts, crafts and architecture of the master craftsmen of the Gampola period.
