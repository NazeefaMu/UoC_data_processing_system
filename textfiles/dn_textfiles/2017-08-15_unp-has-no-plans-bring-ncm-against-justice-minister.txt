UNP has no plans to bring NCM against Justice Minister

The United National Party (UNP) has no plans to bring a No-Confidence Motion (NCM) against Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, Higher Education and Highways Minister and Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella said yesterday.
There was speculation in the media that a group of UNP MPs will bring a No-Confidence Motion against Minister Rajapakshe for allegedly delaying prosecution of the former regime’s politicians over fraud and corruption and for violating the collective responsibility of the cabinet.
Speaking to the media in Kandy, the minister said that the Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe matter will be taken up for discussion at the UNP working committee meeting slated for Thursday (17).
While noting that either a civilian or politician had no right to interfere in ongoing court cases, the minister said that however anyone could highlight the deficiencies related to the administration of the judiciary.
The minister made special mention about the delays in hearing court cases and added that steps have to be taken to rectify anomalies.
He went on to say that files on 80 cases related to corruption and fraud committed during the past regime have been handed over to the Attorney Generals department about one year back after completing investigations.
The minister lamented the delay in taking legal action against those responsible for the malpractices and added that in this backdrop it was natural for one to feel whether such delays were intentional. He said today people were questioning the representatives they sent to parliament over the delays in taking legal action on the former regime’s fraud and corruption cases.
