Focused destination marketing needed - Airwing Chief

Sri Lanka is in urgent need of a more focused destination marketing campaign especially for the off seasons, said veteran hotelier Mervyn Fernandopulle.
Involved in both the airline (Airwing Tours) and hotel sector (Royal Castle Hotel Negombo) for the past four decades, he said that today travel patterns have changed and new marketing tools are needed to attract tourists.
Managing Director of both these ventures, he said that today the Web has got priority and travel agents and tour operators are losing their share.
He explained that with the dawn of peace, the tourist industry has once again awoken and this has seen new players coming to invest in the industry which in turn has seen room capacity of the country increasing by leap and bounds.
“In addition, new areas like the North East was opened up giving tourists the opportunity to move away from traditional destinations like the South, Negombo and the hill country. This obviously puts pressure on us,” he said.
Fernandopulle who also heads the Small and Medium Tourists Hotels Association (ASMED) said the ‘home stay’ concept has also been introduced giving more accommodation options for the tourist.
He however said that the biggest problem faced is from the informal sector which offers rooms with better facilities than home stay and for a cheaper price than two star hotels. “The irony of this is that while taxpayers like us have to renew our license every year with a tedious process, the informal sector simply register their business with the local authorities and function smoothly.”
“We are requesting the Sri Lanka Tourism Ministry to seriously look at renewing some of the annual licenses for hotels at least every two or three years as the annual renewal process takes a lot of time and manpower.”
He said the authorities should also look at separate destination marketing where places like Negombo, Bentota, Kandy and the East Coast are marketed separately targeting the off season.
“They should look at more Asian countries to woo tourists for the off season.”
He said that entertainment is another area and the Ministry should step forward to take off some of the uncalled-for restrictions on the industry.
“We have also taken a step to introduce a special 75 cover night club with DJ music and other entertainment at Royal Castle Hotel Negombo and will open up ‘The Happenings’ a rooftop restaurant and entertainment area adjoining the region’s only rooftop swimming pool, next month.”
Royal Castle Negombo also offers guests who enjoy partying an exclusive bar - ‘Spazio Pub’ - with a trendy ambience and perfect mix of fun and music.
