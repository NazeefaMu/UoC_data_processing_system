The International Solar Alliance (ISA) Founding Conference and Solar Summit is due to be held in New Delhi on March 11.

Around 500 delegates from all over the world are expected to participate in the conference including around 30 heads of state / government.
Sri Lanka signed the Framework Agreement on ISA on January 31, in New Delhi. With the completion of the ratification process, Sri Lanka has now become a full-fledged member of ISA. As of date, 54 countries have signed / ratified ISA. President Maithripala Sirisena attended the launch of ISA at the COP-21 in Paris on November 30, 2015. The ISA was launched by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and the then President of France Francois Hollande.
The ISA is conceived as a coalition of 121 solar resource rich countries (lying fully or partially between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn) to address their energy needs, through a common platform for collaboration, for achieving speed, scale and skills for deploying available solar technologies; facilitating strategic and collaborative solar R&D; and lowering the cost of finance for solar projects and capacity building.
The ISA aims to mobilize more than US$ 1 trillion of investments needed by 2030 for massive deployment of solar energy. ISA is committed to contribute significantly towards the global efforts for achieving Sustainable Development Goals and objectives of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.
