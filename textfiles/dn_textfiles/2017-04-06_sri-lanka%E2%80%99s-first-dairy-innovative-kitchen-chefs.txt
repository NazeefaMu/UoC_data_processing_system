Sri Lanka’s first dairy innovative kitchen for chefs

Foodies are set to receive a delicious boost to their out-of-home dining experience, with the opening of Sri Lanka’s first dairy innovation kitchen for the food service industry.
To cater to the growing interest in out-of-home dining, Fonterra’s food service business, Anchor Food Professionals, has opened an innovation kitchen to trial new dairy products and work with chefs to develop new recipes and flavours that suit the tastes of Sri Lankan consumers.
Fonterra’s Global Director of Foodservice Grant Watson, who officially opened the innovation kitchen said people around the world and here in Sri Lanka are dining out more often, but with more choice than ever before it’s important that the industry focuses on creating an experience that really stands out.
“People are looking to try interesting and delicious foods, sample new tastes and flavours and have that authentic experience. That’s why with so many options available, innovation and high quality ingredients are key areas that the industry needs to focus on, making today’s opening of our innovation kitchen an important step for our foodservice business,” he added.
