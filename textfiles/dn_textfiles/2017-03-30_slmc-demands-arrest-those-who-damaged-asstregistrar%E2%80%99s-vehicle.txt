SLMC demands arrest of those who damaged Asst.Registrar’s vehicle

The Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) urged the authorities to find the culprits behind the attack that damaged the vehicle of its Assistant Registrar Dr. Chandana Atapattu at his house in Mulleriyawa on March 19.
A member of the SLMC Dr. Upul Gunasekara said that so far nobody had been arrested in this connection.
He made these observations yesterday at a press conference held at the Sri Lanka Medical Council auditorium.
He said that Dr Atapattu had no personal enemies. “It is better if the authorities find out the culprits to verify on whose need the attack was made or if it was an attempt to put the responsibility on some one else.
He also said that since 2002 there had been six threats to the SLMC and to its members on six occasions and none of the culprits had been arrested or action taken against.
Queried by the media if the SLMC suspected that the SAITM had any involvement in this attack Dr Gunasekara said that the they were not aware of it. “But most of the attacks had been during the periods when private medical colleges faced issues,” Dr Gunasekara said. “The SLMC only needed to find as to who had a grudge against the SLMC.”
He also said that the SLMC is a statutory body established under the Medical Council Ordinance for the purpose of protecting health care seekers by ensuring the maintenance of academic and professional standards, discipline and ethical practice by health professionals who are registered with it. He also added that none of the members were paid but is conducting an honorary service. “If actions were taken against the culprits it would be a strength to the members to render their service to the nation with a sense of confidence,” said Dr Gunasekara.
Members also said that the attack on the vehicle was made at dawn and High Quality CCTV camera’s in the houses in the vicinity have recorded the culprit coming riding a motorcycle and hurling stones targeting the Dr Athapattu’s vehicle. They added that one CCTV footage has been handed over to the Police and if it were not sufficient the Police could get the CCTV clips of the other houses to expedite the investigation.
Registrar of the SLMC Dr Terance Gunaratne de Silva, Prof Rizvi Sheriff, Dr Sivaprian, Assistant registrar of the SLMC Dr Chandana Atapattu also were present.
