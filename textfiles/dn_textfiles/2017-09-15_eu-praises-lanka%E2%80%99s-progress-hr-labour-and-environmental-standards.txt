EU praises Lanka’s  progress on HR, labour and environmental standards

The European Union praised the government for the progress made in advancing human rights, labour and environmental standards, but stressed that there were many areas where reform had yet to be delivered.
A team of senior officials from Brussels have been in the country for the last 10 days on a fact-finding mission.
The mission has focused on the status of the implementation of 27 international conventions, of which Sri Lanka is a signatory, the EU office in Sri Lanka said.
Progressive implementation of the conventions is the condition for continued preferential access to the European Union market - the world’s largest and Sri Lanka’s biggest export market – under the GSP Plus.
The team had a range of meetings with ministers, civil society, trade unions and international organisations. They also travelled to Jaffna and Kilinochchi to meet the Northern Province Chief Minister and hear the views from civil society, including human rights activists.
Following a meeting with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Ambassador Tung-Lai Margue said: “The cooperation by the government is a reminder of how much the situation has changed in the country over the last two and a half years, including advances in human rights. But there are important concerns about the lack of concrete progress in key areas”.
“It is of paramount importance that the government delivers on its commitments, including replacing the Prevention of Terrorism Act with counter-terrorism legislation consistent with international standards and allowing people in custody to have access to a lawyer from the point of arrest. Clarifying the fate of those who disappeared at the end of the war and speeding up the return of land will help restore confidence, particularly in the North and East, in the policy of national reconciliation.”
Concerns were also raised about continued discrimination against women and girls and against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Sri Lankans,” Margue said.
The assessment, along with that of the other countries benefitting from GSP Plus, will be published in January 2018. It will be considered by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers.
