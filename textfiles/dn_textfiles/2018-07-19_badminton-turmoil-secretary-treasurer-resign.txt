Badminton in turmoil as secretary, treasurer resign

The secretary general Mohan Wjeyathilaka and treasurer Mangala Gamage of the Sri Lanka Badminton Association have resigned from their respective posts officials close to the association told the Daily News.
Former Minister of Sports Dayasiri Jayasekara had issued an extraordinary gazette suspending the registration of Sri Lanka Badminton Association, the national association for badminton and further ordered that the election be convened and held to elect new office bearers to the SLBA for 2017.
After the gazette order the world governing body of badminton (BWF) banned them. Later Ministry and Association officials held diplomatic discussions with BWF and had the ban lifted after agreeing to conduct proper elections.
BWF have permitted them to set up an interim committee until proper elections are held for Sri Lanka Badminton Association (SLBA). The interim committee comprised Nishantha Jayasinghe, Clarence Homer, Mangala Gamage, Rohan de Silva and a member appointed by the Director General of the Department of Sports Development.
Clarence Homer and Rohan de Silva resigned a few months before due to some internal issue and later Mohan Wjeyathilaka and Mangala Gamage were appointed - now they too have tendered their resignation.
Officials also revealed that there is huge political interference in the current committee and they are not considering the badminton development. The appointed committee is unable to work independently to carry out their work at SLBA.
Mohan Wijeyathilaka has mentioned in his resignation letter that he accepted the position with the intention that elections to the Sri Lanka Badminton Association would held as soon as possible and the administration of the SLBA handed over to the duly elected office bearers, but he finds that it is not a possibility at the moment.
“The decision to resign has been taken to ensure the continuity of badminton in Sri Lanka as well as to ensure that the BWF would not deem the Sports Minister to abrogate any undertakings that had been purportedly given by the previous Minister to BWF, in their meeting in Dubai,” Wijeyathilaka stated in the letter.
Officials further said BWF refused to accept Wijeyathilaka’s appointment as secretary, until, Nishantha Jayasinghe the president of the IC completed the required form informing the BWF of Wijeyathilaka’s appointment as secretary.
The SLBA is in a risky position of being suspended due to these issues, Wijeyathilaka stated.
