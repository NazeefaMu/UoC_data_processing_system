Citizens' Mail

May they be forgotten forever
Apropos your editorial “MR's Memory Loss” in your issue of August 22 is very timely. This selective loss of amnesia is probably the most infectious/contagious disease prevalent in this country. In addition to the whole host of people you mentioned suffering from this disease, it is fast spreading to the sporting arena as well.
First, we have the Captain of the Sri Lankan Cricket team saying he does not know what he put in his mouth and then another cricketer who says he was not aware of someone else raping a foreign woman in his own hotel room! Shades of “Ripley's Believe it or Not”!!
