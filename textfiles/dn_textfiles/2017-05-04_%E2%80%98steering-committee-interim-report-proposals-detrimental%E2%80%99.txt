‘Steering Committee Interim report proposals detrimental’

Formulation of new Constitution:
National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader and MP Wimal Weerawansa said yesterday that proposals in the Interim report of the Steering Committee for formulating a new Constitution is detrimental and is aimed at weakening the strength and power of the people and the country.
According to this interim report, Sri Lanka will be turned into a Federal states. We will raise awareness on this issue among Parliamentarians and also among the public and urge them to oppose a federal solution outlined in the interim report.
Addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday,Weerawansa said there is a another attempt to weaken the structure of the Sri Lankan government through the Geneva resolution. There is an attempt to punish the Security Forces from the lower ranker to the Commander in Chief for defeating LTTE terrorists thorough this resolution.
"While that operation is going on, there will be another death trap of formulating a new Constitution. The interim report of the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly does not contain any benefited proposal for Sri Lanka and it
contains only harmful proposals,which if implemented would weaken Parliament," he said.
"Although at present, Provincial Councils can only formulate ordinance, these proposals will give them the ability to formulate laws. Sri Lanka with these proposals will become a federal stat in the future,Weerawansa added.
Pivithuru Hela Urumaya leader Udaya Gammanpila said "We have always said that various attempts are being made from time to time to bring a federal Constitution.According to the draft proposals,the word unitary means one and not undivided or indivisible.It is not mentioned anywhere that the country can not be divided," he said.
"One of the clauses in these proposals suggested that the TNA’s demand for a merger of the North and East should also be reconsidered,” Gammanpila said.
