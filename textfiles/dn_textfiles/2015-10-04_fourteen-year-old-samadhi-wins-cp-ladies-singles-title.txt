Fourteen year old Samadhi wins CP Ladies Singles Title

Fourteen year old Samadhi Hettiarachchi of Mahamaya Girls College, Kandy, came up with a stupendous performance to win the Central Province Ladies Singles Title at the Central Province Table Tennis Championship organized by the Kandy District Table Tennis Association and held at the Jagath Rajapakse International Table Tennis Stadium, Ganegoda.
This performance came in as no surprise as she took to table tennis at the age of six when she was in grade one in 2007, from there onwards she has shown signs of a champion.
She was initially coached by former National Table Tennis coach Mahinda Ellepola and her present coach is Buddhika Dikkumbura and Chandima Abeyratne. She had a slow beginning and in 2008 at the age of 7 she was the under 10 'B' Division runner up and also runner up in under 8 in the tournaments held in Central Province.
From 2008 onwards she won her College colours. In 2011 she flourished when she ended as runner up in the all island Intermediate Novices Championship (under 10).
A championship title continued to elude her as she finished runner up in the under 12 age group both at the Junior National Championship held at Nawalapitiya in 2013 and also at the Centenary Celebration of Dharmasoka College, Ambalangoda. Her first success came at the Central Province Table Tennis Championship held in 2014 when she won the girls under 15 title.
From there onwards there was no looking back as a little star was born. Her maiden success egged her to perform better and she had to prove that this was no 'flash in the pan.'
She continued to perform well and was looked at the local version of David who is bent on taming the Goliaths.
Next she finished runner up at the Central Province Ladies Singles event in 2014.
She represented Mahamaya Girls College at the island schools games organized by the Ministry of Education in the girls under 15 team event.
This year she once again represented Mahamaya Girls College in the under 15 team event at the National School Games organized by the Ministry of Education.
Her school became champions and she played a key role in winning her events. She displays excellent court craft and is a good fighter not withstanding who her opponent is.
In winning the Central Province Ladies Singles Title she beat the former Senior National Singles runner up 3-0.
Still 14 years of age she shows a lot of promise for the future.
