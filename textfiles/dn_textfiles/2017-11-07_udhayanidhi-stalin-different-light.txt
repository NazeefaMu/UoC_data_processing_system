Udhayanidhi Stalin in a different light

‘Ippadai Vellum’ will showcase its male lead Udhayanidhi Stalin in a different light says the film’s director Gaurav Narayanan. Talking at a press meet in Chennai, Gaurav said, “I was the first one who wanted the combination of Udhay, Soori and Imman. But they have become a successful combo already. We have a song where the common man is portrayed as a realistic hero. The verses of the song are more natural. The film wouldn’t have been done with the co-operation of all my artistes including Udhayanidhi, Soori and Manjima Mohan. All my artistes were director’s artistes.”
Interestingly, this is actor-producer Udhayanithi Stalin’s first film under a different banner. Ippadai Vellum has been bankrolled by Lyca Productions who are the producers of 2.0. Talking at the meet, Lyca’s Raju Mahalingam said that the company wanted to support good scripts. “After Kaththi and 2.0, a lot of people had asked us if we would produce only big budget films. The script matters not the budget,” he said.
