Ravi's issue figures in cabinet

President stresses the need to be united:
Harin says AG’s Dept should be empowered to probe previous Govt. :
Extensive discussions took place at the Cabinet meeting, last morning, on the controversy surrounding Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
Minister Rajitha Senarathne, commenting on the matter, had said the Presidential Commission was appointed to look into the Bond issue and that the “apartment issue was totally irrelevant to it”. However, Cabinet Ministers had reportedly voiced their objection to it.
Senarathne had also blamed a ministerial colleague regarding the appointment of a spouse of one of the officers of the Attorney General to an authority falling under her purview. The Minister had defended her stance stating that the spouse was well qualified to be in her position and as such no insinuations should be drawn.
President Maithripala Sirisena who was chairing the meeting had then shifted his focus to Minister Harin Fernando who had earlier commented on the Bond Commission, saying that the mechanism of the Presidential Commission had finally been able to address issues of corruption and find evidence relating to it. Fernando had also said that the UNP’ers feel unfairly targeted.
The President had asked Fernando regarding the comments made, to which Fernando had reportedly responded saying that the Attorney Generals department should be strengthened to continue to handle cases of corruption including those of the previous regime.
Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe had reportedly responded in what was described as a “long harangue”.
Both Fernando and Kabir Hashim had said that many members and supporters of the United National Party also feel that they have been unfairly targeted whilst members of the previous regime alleged of corruption have not been held responsible.
President Sirisena had then intervened and informed the Ministers that the Bond Commission was formulated in consultation with the Prime Minister and that the recent issue should not drive a wedge between the government.
He had insisted that the government should work united and ensure smooth functioning of government.
Meanwhile, it was also reported that whilst the President was chairing the meeting, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had left the meeting 90 minitues before it ended.
Speculation was rife that he had left the meeting to meet Minister Ravi Karunanayake who may have entered the premises of the Presidential Secretariat, where the Cabinet meeting was held.
