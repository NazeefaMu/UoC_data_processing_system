Banku Weeraya at British School and  Western Aesthetic Institute

Senior writer Praneeth Dhanushka recently handed over the first copies of Beerbalge Nuvana, a translation of ‘The Wisdom of Birbal’ to veteran actors Sriyantha Mendis and Lucien Bulatsinhala. The book is a translation of a series of traditional Indian folktales woven to exhibit the unique wisdom of Birbal, the main courtier of King Akbar’s court in India.
According to the stories in the book, Birbal wins every challenge successfully by using his spiritual wisdom, coveted by other ministers in the court. In every turn, King Akbar praises and applauds for the great wisdom of Birbal and enjoys by looking how Birbal unrolls difficult challenges quite easily in a brainy way. The core of the stories in the book offers a good background to improve the qualitative and virtuous personality among young generation.
This is Praneeth Dhanushka’s fourth book. He won a massive popularity as a writer through his previous book Vyjayanthimala - A Great Life of an Actress in Sri Lanka and India too.
The Sinhala language expert Prof. Sandagomi Coparahewa at the University of Colombo vouches for the quality of Dhanushka’s translation. The book is a Stamford Lake publication. It contains nearly 85 pages including attractive photographs for every story.
