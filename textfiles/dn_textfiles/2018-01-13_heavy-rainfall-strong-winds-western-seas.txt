Heavy rainfall, strong winds off Western seas

Naval and fishing communities have been requested to be vigilant due to an active cloudiness in the sea areas to the West of Sri Lanka. The possibility for heavy showers or thundershowers and sudden roughness, associated with sudden increase of wind speed (up to 70-80 kmph) in the deep and shallow sea areas off the coast extending from Puttalam to Balapitiya via Colombo is high, the Meteorological Department said yesterday.
