No belief in  women-oriented films

Actress Kajol, who is gearing up for the release of her forthcoming film ‘Helicopter Eela’, says she does not believe in women-oriented films, but believes in good films and scripts.
Kajol interacted with the media at the trailer launch of ‘Helicopter Eela’, along with her co-actors Riddhi Sen, Neha Dhupia, director Pradeep Sarkar and producers Ajay Devgn and Jayantilal Gada.
Actresses like Vidya Balan and Rani Mukerji have turned their focus on women-oriented films by doing projects like ‘Tumhari Sulu’, ‘Kahaani’ series and “Hichki” and ‘Mardani’.
Asked if she is also focusing on that zone, she said, “I don’t believe in women-oriented films. I believe in good films and scripts. I would say the same for my counterparts - whether it is Vidya Balan or Rani Mukerji for that matter." In ‘Helicopter Eela’, Kajol plays an obsessive mother who continuously keeps a tab on her son’s activities. Written by Mitesh Shah, the movie is co-produced by Ajay Devgn and Jayantilal Gada of Pen India Ltd. ‘Helicopter Eela’ is slated to release on September 7. IANS
