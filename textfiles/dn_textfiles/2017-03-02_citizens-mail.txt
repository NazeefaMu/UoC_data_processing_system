Citizens' Mail

Live and let live SAITM
It seems that the GMOA is unable to accept the verdict of the Appeal Court and want to descend to the law of the jungle to obtain their own way on the SAITM matter.
This a clear example as Lord Kipling said many years ago of “Power without responsibility, the privilege of harlots throughout the ages”. Nobody denies their right to protest but to seek extra judicial means and blackmail is simply not permissible. To align with JVP shows an amnesia of deplorable events leading to the closure of universities for several years. Is this the agenda of the GMOA?
One is compelled to comment on the eight Deans of Medical Facilities, making a thoroughly impractical proposal to suspend student enrolment for six months. Which means closure of the place and firing of staff and suspending all teaching. On the other hand if these wise Deans were from prestigious universities we might take note, but Lo and Behold all our Universities rank below 2000 in the level of worldwide ranking. What is said is that even in Asia we don't make even the first 200! Is the pot calling the kettle black? Set your own house in order before trying to correct others.
The SLMC complains about the lack of clinical training. Now this is interesting. I don't know about this training, but we seem to put out rapid fire doctors used to treat a hundred patients in a morning. The ritual of bedside diagnosis is dead, and practiced by a very few physicians. There is an increase in diagnostic testing and a steep decline in bedside diagnosis.
It is not time we have faith and trust in our own people. We accept doctors trained in faraway places like Nepal, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Belarus etc, but cannot allow a nascent institution trying to get off the ground at home. Give SAITM fair chance, and I am sure in 25 years it could become shining example of medical education.
There is a cowardly attempt to cruelly thwart hundreds of students aspiring to join a noble profession on some flimsy grounds which can be resolved.
