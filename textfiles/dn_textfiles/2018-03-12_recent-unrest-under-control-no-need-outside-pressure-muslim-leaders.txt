The Government authorities and the civil society jointly established the Biyagama electorate Inter Religiousthnic Committee recently for easing tensions among multi-ethnic and multi-religious communities, building bridges, and coming together to solve common social issues.
Al-Haj M.M.A. Ismail, the President of the Gampaha Muslim Association and Treasurer of Muslim Education Forum, key member who mooted the concept speaking during its inaugural meeting said the Government had been able to bring the situation under control within a short period and there was no need for any international intervention to solve the issue.

While stating that the recent violent incidents should be fully investigated, he stressed that no foreign bodies should be allowed to get involved in the process.
Ismail said the new committee focuses on strengthening community networks mentored by religious leaders to help communities evolve a pluralistic national identity.
He said the organisation would strengthen inter religious people-to-people community engagement for reconciliation and social cohesion.
Ismail said Muslims and Muslim organisations in Sri Lanka will always extend their fullest support to the Government to establish peace and reconciliation.
He said Muslims have always being living in peace and harmony with Sinhalese and other communities for centuries. He appreciated the President and Prime Minister’s assurance that compensation will be provided to the affected and buildings which were destroyed will be fully restored soon.
Several Muslim leaders and Moulavi’s speaking at the event endorsed Ismail’s position and noted that the issue should be solved through discussions among communities without seeking any outside help.
Chief Incumbent of the Kanduboda Vivekaramaya Ven.Parakaduwe Saranankara Thera speaking at the event said that creating communal and religious disharmony in the country is similar to promoting terrorism and added that no room should be allowed for communal and religious differences to divide the country again.
He said those who spread religious hatred are not protecting the religion but promoting division. The Thera praised the establishment of the committee and added that it was a timely initiative to protect ethnic and religious harmony.
