IGP questioned by Special Committee

Inspector General of Police Pujith Jayasundara was questioned yesterday by the three member Special Committee appointed to investigate allegations leveled against the IG that he had obtained a bribe of Rs. 12 million from a former Principal of Trinity College, Kandy in 2008.
Minister of Public Administration and Management and Law and Order Ranjith Maddumabandara had appointed this three member Commission comprising three senior administration officials, Additional Secretary to the Ministry of Public Administration and Management and Law and Order Mala Basnayake, Additional Secretary W.A. Dharmasiri and Director Combined Services Aloka Bandara. Mala Basnayake heads the Committee.
The Committee commenced its investigations yesterday, while the IGP was called before the Committee and questioned for around three hours, recording his statement.
The Law and Order Minister noted that his ministry expects to conduct a fair and impartial investigation into these charges leveled against the IG.
A complaint was lodged with the Bribery Commission alleging that Police Chief Pujith Jayasundara had obtained a bribe of Rs.12 million from a former Principal of Trinity College, Kandy in 2008.
At that time, Jayasundara was the DIG in charge of the Central Province when the ex-Principal Robert Gilbert was deported by courts, but he had been in hiding in Kandy, according to reports.
A person by the name of Nishantha de Alwis had stated that Jayasundara had allegedly obtained the money promising not to arrest Gilbert.
Despite a court order, Gilbert is said to have come to Sri Lanka and attended the wedding of his son at a hotel in Kandy.
It was reported that the alleged bribe was handed over by way of a cash cheque dated 20 August 2008 to Jayasundara from account No.180837076 maintained at the HNB Kandy branch by persons connected to Trinity College.
However,the IGP had refuted these allegations and called for the charges to be investigated.
