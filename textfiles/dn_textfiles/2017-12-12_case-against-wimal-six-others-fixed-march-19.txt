Causing disturbance to public
Case against Wimal, six others fixed for March 19

The Colombo Chief Magistrate yesterday fixed for March 19 a case filed against National Freedom Front Leader (NFF) Wimal Weerawansa and six other party activists for allegedly providing leadership to a protest which blocked the main roads at Bauddhaloka Mawatha, causing disturbance to the people and the normal flow of traffic.
On February 6, 2016, the NFF staged a protest march against the visit of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein.
However, MP Weerawansa was not present in Court. President's Counsel Jayantha Weerasinghe appearing for Wimal Weerawansa informed that his client was not present in Court since he is attending Parliament sessions.
Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara ordered the surety holder of Wimal Weerawansa that a letter issued by the Secretary General of Parliament be submitted in Court on the next hearing date in order to ascertain his absence.
Six suspects including NFF leader and Colombo District MP Wimal Weerawansa, Jayantha Samaraweera, Weerakumara Dissanayake, Piyasiri Wijenayake, Roger Seneviratne, Mohammed Muzammil and Don Lusian are currently out on bail. The seventh suspect Chaminda Jayalal was not present in Court yesterday and Court was informed that the police were yet to trace his whereabouts.
The Cinnamon Gardens Police had informed Court that the suspects who organized the procession had failed to obtain the prior permission from police to organise the march. They further alleged that the organizers had also used loudspeakers without a valid license. Police further submitted to Court that the suspects provided leadership to a protest which blocked the main road at Bauddhaloka Mawatha towards Havelock Town, causing disturbance to the people and the normal flow of traffic. President’s Counsel Jayantha Weerasinghe with Counsel Kapila Gamage appeared for the suspects.
