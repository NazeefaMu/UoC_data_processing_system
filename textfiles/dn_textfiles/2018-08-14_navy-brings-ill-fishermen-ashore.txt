Navy brings ill fishermen ashore

The Fast Attack Craft P 439 of the Eastern Naval Command brought an ill fisherman ashore on a multi-day fishing trawler for immediate treatment yesterday (13).
The Navy sent the craft to get the patient who was vomiting blood. He was on the multi-day fishing trawler, Sara II, which had left for fishing practices from the Codbay fisheries harbour on August 2. The patient was transferred to the Fast Attack Craft about 90 nautical miles off the Foul Point, Trincomalee. Hee was admitted to the Trincomalee General Hospital.
