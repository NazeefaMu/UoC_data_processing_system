Statesman in motion

That was a beautiful, clear, morning. Don Stephen Senanayake comes to Galle Face Green for horse-riding with his close allies, Richard Aluvihare and G G Ponnambalam. While riding the horse, they have a small talk on development plans for Ceylon, an independent state yet to be sovereign.

Everything turns upside within a few seconds.
Don Stephen Senanayake has a fall unexpectedly. Before his allies could understand anything, Senanayake faces his fate. And that indicates the beginning of Suneth Malinga Lokuhewa’s latest cinematic venture, Nidahase Piya, the first political biopic of Sri Lanka.
Nidahase Piya introduces a host of personalities dealing with Don Stephen Senanayake including Oliver Goonetilleke, Ponnambalam Ramanathan and S W R D Bandaranaike. History-based films have once been the pinnacle of Sri Lankan film-making. However, Lokuhewa makes an attempt to buck that trend. He treads a not-so-easy path.
“When we made Sinhavalokanaya it was a new experience to the audience. If we made this film in 1997, immediately after the 1996 World Cup win, we could have raked in blueblood profits. But we made that film in 2010 to encourage the 2011 World Cup.”
Nidahase Piya shooting will begin towards the end of January and will be released to celebrate the 70th anniversary of Independence in 2018. The shooting will take place in areas such as Colombo, Mirigama and Ranmihithenna.
While digging for information, the Nidahase Piya team found out that the film will be an ideal pathway for the younger generation to familiarise the Sri Lankan history. However, he was not short of challenges.
“The casting was the main challenge. All the lead characters are known personalities in the Sri Lankan history. And the people have already seen them in pictures. Some of them are on youtube too on brief video clips. Their audio clips are also available. That means we cannot cheat our audience. So we had to choose characters with some resemblance to those key figures.”

Nidahase Piya offers a cinematic interpretation to Sri Lanka’s historical incidents such as formation of the Temperance Movement in 1912 as well as some other minor, yet very much intriguing, incidents in the iconic premier’s life.

The scriptwriting was teamwork with contributors aplenty, including Justice and Buddhist Affairs Minister Dr Wijedasa Rajapakshe who is also the producer of the film. About 20 percent of the script is in English, which used to be the main medium of expression between DS and his colleagues. The research executed by an academic team of Kelaniya University has also been instrumental in drafting the script.
“Believe it or not, I have had the timeline of DS. It included the trivia that many of us had not known before,” Lokuhewa notes.
That was the very first activity: filling the gaps in the timeline up to the untimely death of the protagonist.
“Exploring other personalities who dealt with DS was quite important. One such major figure is Henry Pedris, who was shot down at the Welikada prison. If not for that historical incident, gaining Independence would still have been confined to talks. The local politicians, irrespective of their ethnic origin, leagued to fight for Independence.”
Next, the camera pans to portray the world situation. DS’ Ceylon was struggling amid two major World Wars which took a huge toll on the little island. The world situation offers a better picture to local events. For instance, E W Silva sailed to England. That he had a letter tucked inside his shoes is common knowledge. The sailing was not, however, recommended during the period as there were constant attacks of torpedo.
One may naturally place this film under the documentary genre. However, Lokuhewa loathes that genre.
“This is essentially a feature film. There have been a number of biopics such as Lincoln, Gandhi, Queen, Iron Lady and King’s Speech. They are categorised as features films at the Oscars,” Lokuhewa observes.
