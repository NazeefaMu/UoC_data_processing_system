Writing beyond English

I write novels set in South India. In English, I invent characters shaped by other languages, primarily Tamil, but also sometimes Hindi. Many of my characters don’t just not speak English, they don’t think or feel English; which is to say, their interiority, the infinite and often occult world of their minds and hearts, is not English. Of course, neither the speech of my characters nor their interiority can be seen as separate from their society and their history. To imagine my non-English-speaking characters in English I must translate not just their speech—their dialogue—but entire worlds, internal and external.
Translate is simply shorthand. Writing a novel in English about a Tamil world may involve actual translation—of a real or imagined piece of Tamil text, for example—but the writing of the novel is not in itself translation except in the most metaphorical of senses. We should rigorously distinguish writing a novel in English about a Tamil world from translating a Tamil novel into English. Why? Because, if the aesthetic integrity of the novel is to be maintained, the novel has to be invented in/through English, not Tamil.
Written elsewhere
You have to invent, in English, Tamil speech, feeling, action, philosophy, faith, family, friendship, hostility, love, work, and all the other things that go into the making of a world. You invent in English a Tamil world. Certainly, you can learn from translation how to go about this invention—as I did when I translated Komal Swaminathan’s great Tamil play Thaneer, Thaneer into English—but invention is not the same as translation because at its bottom, as I have written elsewhere, translation is interpretation of a prior text.
Invention is not this kind of interpretation. So something mysterious has to happen: you have to find within English the wherewithal to depict a Tamil world. Language itself is your ally here; it is itself a resource. I don’t mean by this the capability of a specific language such as English or Tamil but rather the generative power inherent in all languages as language. Philosophers of language like Walter Benjamin and literary theorists like Gayatri Spivak have spoken of this power, which is the power of a language to transcend its own specific historical location. The English-language novelist confronted by the challenges of creating a non-English world needs to discover and access this power.
Alongside language, genre is at issue. How should we classify novels in English extensively populated with non-English-speaking characters? Writing fiction in English about communities that don’t function in English raises such specific challenges of craft and ethics that we should really think of such fiction as a genre unto itself. Neither scholarly criticism nor creative writing has sufficiently acknowledged this obvious notion because the challenges attending the writing of such fiction are still inadequately understood.
Postcolonial literature
Recently, criticism has spent substantial energy in a historical and theoretical mode on exploring postcolonial literature written in English. This literature more often than not depicts non-English-speaking communities. Criticism has had interesting things to say about this literature. However, it has, in a manner typical of criticism in general, remained oblivious to questions of craft and technique.
For its part, creative writing pedagogy has not fully acknowledged the peculiar difficulties of creating realistic non-English-speaking communities in English. At most, these difficulties are addressed in the writing of dialogue. Would such a character speak in quite this fashion? is a question sometimes posed in a creative writing context. Certainly, such questions put needed pressure on dialogue as the external mark of a character’s authentic interiority. However, the challenges of inventing a non-English-speaking world in English through the tools and rules of the novel go beyond dialogue.
They include narrative voice. For ethical and political reasons, my concern throughout my most recent novel, Ghost in the Tamarind, is to tell the story in a way internal to the narrative—that is, to imagine and narrate the Tamil world of the novel from the perspective of someone who is an integral part of that world (though perhaps critical of it).
