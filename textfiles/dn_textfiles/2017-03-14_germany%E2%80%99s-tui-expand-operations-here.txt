Germany’s TUI to expand operations here

The TUI Group, one of the world’s leading tour operators has expressed willingness to expand operations in Sri Lanka.
While expanding tour operations it will also assist Sri Lanka to develop its hospitality training facilities.
TUI is one of the largest outbound tour operators in Europe.
TUI revealed these plans during a discussion between Tourism Development, Lands and Christian Religious Affairs Minister John Amaratunga and top Board Members of the Group that included CEO David Burling and Managing Director, Garry Wilson in Germany last week.
TUI Group Managing Director, Garry Wilson said that TUI was contemplating using Sri Lanka as a hub in the Indian Ocean region to service other regional destinations.
The Minister while assuring that the government will give such a proposal its fullest support also requested assistance to upgrade hospitality training in Sri Lanka.
In response TUI agreed to collaborate with the Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management (formerly Ceylon Hotel School) by providing financial assistance as well trained German professionals to develop both curricula and training facilities.
Sri Lanka Tourism Chairman Paddy Withana said the German government was instrumental in initiating training programmes for Sri Lankan youth in the hospitality industry as early as the 1960s.
CEO, TUI Group, Davind Burling said they hope to announce the Group’s plans for the next three years in November this year.
Under the proposed training program, trainees will receive internationally recognized certificates and language training, making them globally employable.
As the first step, identified satellite schools of the Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management will be developed with TUI’s assistance.
