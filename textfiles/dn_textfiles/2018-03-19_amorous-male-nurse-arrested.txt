Amorous male nurse arrested

A male nurse who tried to sexually abuse a female colleague at the Peradeniya hospital, was arrested last Saturday.
The arrest was made after a complaint lodged by the victim nurse at the Peradeniya police station. The hospital director had transferred them into two different wards on a previous occasion too, after a similar complaint against the male nurse was made by the victim.
Police had found similar allegations had been made by some other nurses too, against this particular male nurse. The male nurse arrested in this regard was released on bail after he was produced before the Magistrate’s Courts in Kandy.
