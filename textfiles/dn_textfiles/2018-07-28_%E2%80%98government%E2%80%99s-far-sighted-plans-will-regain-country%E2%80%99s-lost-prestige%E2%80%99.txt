‘Government’s far-sighted plans will regain country’s lost prestige’

We must get rid of the bad name the former regime had earned internationally with far-sighted plans, SLFP National Organiser and Irrigation, Water Resources and Disaster Management Minister Duminda Dissanayake said.
He was addressing the SLFP Kekirawa Board of Authority meeting organised by Kekirawa SLFP Organiser Rohan Jayakody. The Minister said Rajapaksa nepotism would not do any good to the country but destruction and international disrepute to the nation.
“Our country did not need another Hitler, who supported thuggery corruption, robbing and wasting of national assets,” he said.
He said President Maithripala Sirisena knows about the needs of the people and does not allow his kith and kin to interfere in government policies.
Today the group of 16 are disappointed and desperate. The SLFP is reviving its glory and prestige, he said.
During the past three and half years, we attempted to settle the colossal debts taken by the Rajapaksa regime. “The former president held the presidential elections two years in advance. Astrologer Sumanadasa cannot be blamed for the Rajapaksas’ defeat. Rajapaksa strategies did not work amidst the arising of Maithripala Sirisena as the common candidate at the election,” he said.
“The government is now effectively settling the debts. The Gam Peraliya development programme will lessen the burdens of the people,” he said.
