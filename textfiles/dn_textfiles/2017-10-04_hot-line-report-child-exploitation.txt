Hot line to report child exploitation

The National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) requests the public to inform the nearest police station or call the hot line 1929 whenever child exploitation, cruelty to children or any related incident is observed, NCPA Chairperson Attorney at law Marini de Livera said.
Issuing a statement she said that investigations and follow-ups are going on in connection with some recent child abuse incidents that took place such as abducting a 15 year old girl and forcefully using her as a dancer at a night club, using school children to hold a train of a Bride's Osariya etc.
The NCPA is now regulating the on-going police investigation in connection with abducting and using a 15 year old girl as a dancer at a night club. The police has already arrested the suspects and produced them before the courts, she said.
The NCPA is regulating the investigation under the powers bestowed on it by the National Child Protection Authority Act Number 50 of 1998, she added.
