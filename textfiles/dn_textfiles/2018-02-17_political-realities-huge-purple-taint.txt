POLITICAL REALITIES OF THE HUGE PURPLE TAINT

As this is written five days after the Local Government Poll the confusion still prevails – the disarray caused by those who loudly claimed the result was that of a general election leading to a change of government. It is not that they did not know the reality; rather it was their intent to mislead the public for their own personal political ends. This was a Local Government (LG) election, which the people of this country are quite familiar with. It was held specifically to decide on – what political parties or independents - would assume control of the LG bodies from Municipalities to Urban Councils, Town Councils and Pradeshiya Sabhas, based on the number of members elected.
The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) did obtain a massive victory, gaining control of possibly over 70 % of the local bodies. They were winners who clearly outdid their own expectations, and that of all their opponents.
The UNP came a distant second, and the SLFP much further behind it. But it was for control and management of LG bodies – and not the government of this country. In a county so familiar with cricket, the claim that this result was one for a change of government and prime minister, would look like an electoral exercise to decide on the groundskeepers, and maintenance workers of the major cricket grounds in the country, being considered as the means of selecting the National Cricket Team and its Captain.
There is much of political arithmetic still at play among those seeking to interpret this electoral result being different from what it exactly was. There are also others who do comparative calculations between the January 2015 Presidential Election result and this one, to show that this is no vote to change the unity government of 2015. That is certainly an unnecessary exercise, because the stuff of this poll was wholly different. It may be necessary to move on to political algorithms, closer to local government elections, and also consider the role of social media and the computer and digital analyses, to go into the deeper areas of calculation of this result.
The fact remains that what the people voted for, in essence, was for better and proper management of their local bodies – the building and cleaning of drains, the property rates and assessments, good road construction - maintenance and management, local housing, water supply, drainage, garbage clearance, and Dengue eradication, among key factors.
As the political bedlam settles down with the winners and losers in local government settling down to their tasks, under new laws and regulations, that involve increased female representation, and that of additional candidates; there is also the possibility of legislative amendments to polling laws considering the problem seen in the just concluded poll.
Political realities
The success of the SLPP with a remarkable victory is largely due to the many problems arising from the divisive thinking and politics in what was till recently the ‘unity government’.
The LG Poll campaign gave more opportunities for exposure of these differences, with the President’s loud proclamations of how he would use the sword in his hand, to fight corruption; the clear attacks on the UNP and the Prime Minister from the leading SLFP and UPFA figures in the government ranks, the thinly veiled statements about how they would soon form an SLFP-led government (though not openly talking of joining the Mahinda Rajapaksa camp), and also the attacks on the SLFP rankers within the government by many UNP members, exposed the hugely divided thinking within the government. Such divisions, in the context of the largely worrisome Bond issue, which was fully canvassed by the President himself in attacks on his governing ally – the UNP, would certainly have contributed much to the huge blossoming of the pohottuva of the SLPP.
The confusion in these inter-unity divisions was best seen in President Sirisena’s interview with Derana TV, just four days before the poll, when he clearly stated there was every intention to move together with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, after the local polls, in the fight against corruption and to better build the economy.
The Daily News in its editorial of Thursday 15 – ‘A make or break for Unity Govt.' – made an effective comment on this situation, stating: “In sum, both, the UNP, and, SLFP were acting at cross purposes for the entirety of the Unity Government, resulting in sluggishness in the implementation of government policies, for the people's welfare. The public, naturally, were all at sea, unable to grasp this state of affairs. The UNP’s hands were tied in most instances, with the SLFP always trying to project the image that it was the Blues that was against placing burdens on the public due to UNP’s economic policies.”
The Pohottuva curtain
Behind the vast purple colouring on the map that show the pohottuva won areas in the LG Poll, are many issues that are not mentioned by those who make their howl for an immediate change of government. President Sirisena has already made the appointment of the four- member Commission to probe SriLankan Airways, Mihin Lanka and SriLankan Catering from 2006 to 2018, chaired by retired Supreme Court Justice Anil Guneratne. While many questionable issues involving SriLankan from 2015 till today will be probed, it will also probe the huge mismanagement of SriLankan for many years under the chairmanship of Nishantha Wickremasinghe, who was the brother-in-law of Mahinda Rajapaksa; which involved huge loss making purchases of aircraft, and many issues of corrupt management of his National Carrier. It will also bring out the shocking exposures by the Weliamuna Report, which were not acted on by the SriLankan directors under the unity government.
There is also the much subdued probe into the affairs and funds of the Siriliya Saviya Project of the former First Lady Shiranthi Rajapaksa, which involved the use of Red Cross Jeep, and many more issues of expenditure and opening of bank accounts that have allegedly raised serious questions, as well as the availability of State vehicles for its activities.
There is also the necessity to resume the active probe into the affairs and functioning of the Carlton Sports Network (CSN), allegedly largely owned by the Rajapaksa Family, and the many questionable contracts it has received from the State, as well as the source of funds for the import of vehicles and equipment for it, and the ownership of the property it was housed in.
There is the continuing probe into the moneys and gems or gems and monies obtained by the ‘Forrester’ aunt of Shiranthi Rajapaksa, whose money has allegedly helped one son of the Presidential Rajapaksas to own a property in Dehiwala-Mt. Lavinia. These issues remain to be seriously probed, and cannot be covered by the purple curtain of the SLPP victory in the LG Poll, as big as it was.
The call for an SLFP-UPFA government or the removal of the UNP Prime Minister using the LG Poll victory of the pohottuva for the call to change a government is also a clear attempt to prevent any further action on the Report of the PRECIFAC Commission, which has called for action against key members of the previous Rajapaksa regime, including Mahinda Rajapaksa and Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, on many issues of fraud and corruption involving State funds and alleged violations of State administrative procedures.
It must also be noted that among the loudest voices calling for this government change on an LG Poll result are Wimal Weerawansa who faces charges of fraud involving many millions of rupees from his former ministry on matters of housing and transport, and Johnston Fernando, who is also not free of charges of fraud and corruption, involving the use of Sathosa employees for political work leading to many millions of losses.
Another loud voice in this purple call for a government change, Prasanna Ranatunga, saw the case involving him and his wife on an alleged major threat to a businessman involving over Rs. 60 million, postponed till March 12, 18. The other big talker on pohottuva success - Udaya Gammanpila of the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya, is also the accused in an alleged major cheating of a foreigner over an important Power of Attorney issue.
The purple taint of the pohottuva (SLPP) is clearly one of massive corruption, spread over several years, not to be ignored by the scope of the Treasury Bond issue, and the many issues of inaction against corruption under the unity government. President Sirisena is due to make his own statement of the situation, involving the continuity of the unity government, a day after this is written. Yet, as the UNP and SLFP-UPFA await this presidential decision, it is necessary to avoid any paralysis or hindrance of government on the basis of unreal calls for government change by the purple shouters.
Both the UNP and the UPFA-SLFP must make serious assessments of the constitutional and political realities of governmental change, and not be moved into wrong actions by the unquestioned victory of the SLPP in the LG Polls.
