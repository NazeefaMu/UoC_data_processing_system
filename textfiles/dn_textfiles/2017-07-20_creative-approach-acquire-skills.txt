A creative approach to acquire skills

Create Lab is an education facilitator headquartered in Singapore provides the essential tools and facilities to assist children to develop digital skills and an inventive mindset, that will empower them to thrive in the 21st century. Equipped with resources and expertise from educators from Oxford, MIT and Singapore’s top universities, Create Lab Sri Lanka commenced operations in January this year. Its coding and robotic design workshops have been recognized as Singapore’s leading Computational Thinking enrichment programmes and these programmes caters to children in the age groups of 5 to 12 years.
Create Lab workshops and programmes are designed to encourage children to explore possibilities and acquire skills through a ‘hands on’ personalized approach. The learning environment provided at Create Lab includes role-playing, storytelling, art and music which challenge children to tackle everyday problems by developing solutions through their own computer programmes and hardware.
“In an increasingly digitalized world, the skills that will usher in success are going to be one’s ability to imagine, create, empathize and solve problems. Computer programming and coding skills are powerful tools that can stimulate and bring forth these already existing abilities within children. Coding helps children improve their analytical thinking and help them look at the bigger picture. Empowering children to use technology to create rather than just consume, is what we do best,” Create Lab Co-Founder/Chief Executive Officer, Thilan Wickramasinghecommented in a recently issued press release.
Commenting on the work that Create Lab has initiated in Sri Lanka, Create Lab Director, Michelle Pinto said, “Our main introductory programme Introduction to Computational Thinking (ICT101) will inspire students to become powerful computational thinkers. During our workshops students can code their own computer games, digital art, programme robots and develop hardware. Our focus is to inspire children to experiment, solve problems, identify patterns and use their imagination.
These are highly portable skills that will help them excel in school and at home, but most importantly in their future careers.”
The children are exposed to some of the state-of-the-art software and hardware solutions available and, Create Lab collaborates with the National University of Singapore (NUS) Enterprise, Google, SoftBank and the Infocomm & Media Development Authority of Singaporeto develop their solutions. Create Lab also provides free cloud based resources to allow children to share their work with family and friends and continue to improve their approaches, outside the classroom.
