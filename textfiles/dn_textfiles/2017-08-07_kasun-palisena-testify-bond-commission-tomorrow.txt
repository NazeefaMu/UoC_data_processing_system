Kasun Palisena to testify before bond commission tomorrow

 
Chief Executive Officer of Perpetual Treasuries Limited Kasun Palisena will be testifying before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating into the Treasury bond issue tomorrow.
Palisena was the Chief Dealer of Perpetual Treasuries Limited, prior to becoming the CEO of the same company.
He is a key witness for the investigation on the Treasury bond issue, as he allegedly was involved in the transactions relating to the questioned Treasury bond auction, which took place on February 27, 2015.
Palisena will be represented by President’s Counsel Kalinga Indatissa. Indatissa PC previously represented Arjun Aloysius at the Treasury Bond Commission.
Palisena handed over his digital communication devices to the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) last Friday (04).
On June 07, 2017, the Presidential Commission inquiring into the Treasury bond issue made an order to send Kasun Palisena, who was present at the court room, out,  while evidence was led through Bank of Ceylon former Chief Dealer J.D.K. Dharmapala.
Dharmapala’s testimony included Kasun Palisena’s involvement in certain transactions which were directly related to the questioned Treasury bond auction on 27 February 2015. Considering the nature of evidence being led, the PCoI made the order.
