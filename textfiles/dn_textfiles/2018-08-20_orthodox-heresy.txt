Orthodox heresy

Kamel Daoud first came to attention in 2015 with the publication of his novel Meursault, contre-enquête (translated into English as The Meursault Investigation). The critic Adam Shatz described it as a “post­colonial sequel” to Albert Camus’s L’Étranger. Camus’s novel of 1942 is set in the French Algerian town of Oran and tells the story of an out-of-place anti-hero called Meursault who buries his mother without shedding a tear, makes love to a woman mechanically, and one day kills an “Arab” on a beach, an act that he later blames on sunstroke.
He is condemned to death by guillotine, a fate he reacts to with indifference. From Camus’s perspective, it is a tale of alienation and the absurd. But it is also a novel that says something about the unequal colonial relationship: Arabs, in the novel, are mute and nameless. They are part of the decor of French Algeria, and occasionally threat­ening. In The Meursault Investigation, the “Arab”’s brother reclaims his voice, and talks back.
Wittily irreverent
The novel placed Daoud in the pantheon of francophone novelists. It also ensured that the columns that he had been writing for the daily Quotidien d’Oran would now also appear in Le Monde, La Repubblica and the New York Times. Mes Indépendances is a collection of these columns written between 2010 and 2016 (an American edition, Chroniques, translated by Elisabeth Zerofsky and published by Other Press, is appearing in October). Incisive, occasionally witty and always irreverent, Daoud’s pen spares no one, not the Algerian state, or its aged leader Abdelaziz Bouteflika, or the Islamists that were co-opted by the state after the civil war of the 1990s, or Arab nationalism, or far-right populism in Europe. Daoud’s courage in confronting the Algerian state is particularly commendable. Run by ageing army generals, it is shrouded in secrecy and protected by legions of informants and a brutal police force; its only real source of legitimacy is a war of independence that came to an end more than half a century ago.
One striking aspect of these columns is Daoud’s criticism of the linguistic Arabization of Algeria, which an elite in thrall to the ideology of Arab nationalism imposed on society after independence. He calls this process “the other” colonial project in Algeria. Many Algerian intellectuals agree with him that Algeria is at best an imperfect Arab nation. The elites should have made the spoken tongue, Algerian Arabic, the national language. Anyone who is aware of the linguistic contradictions of the country, torn between French, standard Arabic and Algerian Arabic, would sympathize. However dim Daoud’s view of the Algerian state and of Arab dictators, he reserves his greatest ire for fundamentalism, this “disease of Islam”. He knows the fundamentalists well for having been one in his youth (Daoud is forty-eight). He considers the Salafi televangelists – or “talk show sheikhs” as he calls them – to be the cause of most of the ills of not only Algeria, but the Arab and Islamic world more broadly. In December 2014, one of those televangelists, Abdelfatah Hamadache used Facebook to call for Daoud’s prosecution and execution. He was convicted and sentenced to six months in prison. Beyond Salafism, Daoud’s target is the “matrix” of the fundamentalist problem: the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. For him, ISIS was spawned by the invasion of Iraq on the one hand, and, on the other, by Saudi Arabia, with its “ideological industry” and “fatwa valley”.
Humanitarian grounds
Daoud declines to show solidarity with the Palestinians in the name of religious or ethnic kinship; he would rather do so on humanitarian grounds. He prefers to blame the Palestinian problem on what he sees as the failures of the Arab world and the ravages of fundamentalism. He wishes his fellow Algerians would move on from the habit of blaming their predicament on colonialism, and instead take responsibility for some of their misery. He is a passionate supporter of gender equality.
