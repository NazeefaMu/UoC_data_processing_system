Megapolis and Western Development Ministry outlines development plan

The Megapolis and Western Development Ministry has to face challenges as it was a new experience for the country, the ministry issuing a release said yesterday.
Identifying development projects and completing them are the main challenges faced by the ministry, the release said.
The release: “A number of projects are under way. It will take a few years to complete them. Investors do not agree to invest on projects which do not have formal and viable reports of feasibility studies.
“Having investments for development projects with government involvement has became an issue as it has passed the credit limits. The government is targeting private investors and profits generated by affiliated institutions during the completion of the development projects which have been identified as essential for the country’s future.
“Institutions affiliated to the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry have improved as profitable ventures. They don’t depend on the treasury or the public taxes. The ministry has planned projects to be launched including the launch of seven new Light Rail Transits (LRT) and water transport system while using the water resources with the aim of develop the country's transport system. Multiple transport centres will be developed while improving their facilities. New tunnel systems and manholes will be built to control floods.”
