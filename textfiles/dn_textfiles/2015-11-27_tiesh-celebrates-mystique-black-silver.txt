Tiesh celebrates the mystique of Black Silver

Tiesh unveiled its latest collection of exquisite black silver jewellery themed Black Temptations to some of its loyal customers, family, friends and media last week in a very glitzy affair. These new collections are all studded with precious and semi-precious stones belonging to Sri Lanka.
"Mainly we want to highlight the Sri Lankan stones so from sapphires and semi precious stones. We found that using black plating on the silver enhances the coulour and also gives it a vivid kind of kalaiedoskope of colours and it's not just one colour that you get. So we thought by doing this something new and a first in Sri Lanka we could launch in a big way. We want the public in on our little secret. The stones come from Rathnapura (it been the hub gem and jewelry trade in Sri Lanka), but also Matale and Kandy. We believe that these pieces can be worn for multipurpose occasions depending on what you choose to go for as it could be a very good conversation starter. You wear it and it would get the attention of whoever you meet", Tiesh Director Ayesh de Fonseka stated at the launch of Black Temptations.
"The black rhodium plated 925 sterling silver collection presents itself in an amazing range of shades of grey ranging from enigmatic deep dark greys to almost full black bringing out an ephemeral element of illusion and mystique. Enhancing this mood and heightening the element of colour and fantasy is the delightful array of sparkling Sri Lankan gem stones which liberally embellish each piece of jewellery", he added.
In a press release issued it said that customers can sit with Tiesh's jewellery designers and create their own little masterpieces. Each one-of-a-kind piece from a necklace, bracelet, earring, pendant and ring will complement the other and will stand out strikingly, either singly or in an ensemble.
