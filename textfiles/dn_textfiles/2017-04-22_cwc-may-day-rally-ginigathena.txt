CWC May Day rally in Ginigathena

The May Day rally of the Ceylon Workers' Congress (CWC) led by Arumugam Thondaman will be held in Ginigathena, CWC Vice President S. Arunsamy said.
He said the May Day procession would start at 10am. It would be followed by a rally in the middle of the town.
"Our trade union arm is strong even though we don't hold ministerial portfolios of the government. We will continue to struggle hard to win the rights of plantation workers," he said.
He said a special training programme for plantation leaders has been organised with the support of the ILO. Its inauguration will be held on Sunday, he said.
