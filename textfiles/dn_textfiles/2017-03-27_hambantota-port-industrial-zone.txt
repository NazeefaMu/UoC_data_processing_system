Hambantota Port,  Industrial Zone

Government sources said all information on the Hambantota Port and Industrial Zone would be presented to Parliament and even facilitate a special debate if necessary.
A UNP senior minister said all development projects of the Government are done within the stipulated legal frame work. He said the government do not have any intention to hide anything unlike the previous administration did.
The preliminary agreement on Chinese involvement in Hambantota development had been made in 2012, and the agreements for marine economy, port development and industrial zone were signed during the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping in Sri Lanka in May 2014.
“Information on any of these projects was not revealed to Parliament or the people, despite repeated requests by the UNP and other parties in the Opposition. This trend was reversed in the post January 8 period, and the practice of keeping Parliament informed on all critical matters affecting the country commenced since then,” the senior minister said.
