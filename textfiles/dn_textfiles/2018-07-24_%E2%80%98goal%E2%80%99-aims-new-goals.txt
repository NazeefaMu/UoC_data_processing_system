‘Goal’ aims at new goals

Produced by M Entertainments (Pvt) Ltd as a Sirasa Movie production ‘Goal’ is written and directed by Rohan Perera of ‘Heena Hoyana Samanallu’ and ‘A Level’ fame. The Executive Producer is Susara Dinal.
Like many other schools in rural Sri Lanka, Millawitiya Junior School in Kaluwara Eliya also had minimum facilities for its students. The children came to school, sat in their class in the mornings and wandered around the fields and lakes of the village in the afternoons moving about their lives without any expectations or aims about their future.
An unforeseen twist in their story occurs when Samarasekara Sir comes to
Kaluwara Eliya. He is compelled to teach literature to a bunch of twelve-year olds who thrive on creating havoc in school and outside.
Samarasekara Sir’s sheer determination drives him to form a football team with them. Things begin to change, and lives begin to brighten up as they embark on a journey together to change their own fate. This is the story behind ‘Goal’ which will be unfolding on the silver screen soon.
