World Humanitarian Summit Global Consultation in Geneva
Decisive action to protect human dignity

The first-ever World Humanitarian Summit, set to take place on 23-24 May 2016 in Istanbul, is a call to action by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to reshape the global agenda for humanitarian action. The Summit has two goals. First, it should re-inspire and reinvigorate a joint commitment to humanity, and second, it should initiate a set of concrete actions aimed at enabling all stakeholders to better prepare for and respond to crises, and be more resilient to shocks.
A preparatory World Humanitarian Summit Global Consultation in Geneva meets this week.
Human suffering from the impacts of armed conflicts and disasters has reached staggering levels. Nearly 60 million people, half of them children, have been forced from their homes due to conflict and violence. The human and economic cost of disasters caused by natural hazards is also escalating. In the last two decades, 218 million people each year were affected by disasters; at an annual cost to the global economy that now exceeds $300 billion.
Even as global leaders pledge to "leave no one behind", the needs and dignity of millions of people in crises are being neglected. Millions suffer from the devastation wrought by frequent disasters that recur before they can fully recover their livelihoods. Political paralysis leaves the root causes of armed conflicts and vulnerability to disasters unaddressed, while also hindering access to those in need.
The humanitarian system has never reached more people in so many places, but with its current resources and structure, it is no longer able to address the scale and complexity of present, let alone future needs. Each year, an ever larger proportion of life-saving humanitarian needs remain unmet, despite greater funding contributions. The strengths and skills of the growing diversity of humanitarian partners, particularly from the Global South, are not sufficiently harnessed; nor are the transformative powers of science and technology.
Decisive, collective action is needed to uphold our shared responsibility to save lives and enable people to live lives of dignity.
Between May 2014 and July 2015, eight regional consultations involving more than 23,000 people, as well as major thematic and stakeholder consultations and online dialogues took place, backed by over 400 written submissions. This consultation process resulted in five major areas for action, each presenting an ambition for the future of humanitarian action. From this foundation, stakeholders can build the commitments, partnerships and transformative actions required to deliver change at the World Humanitarian Summit.
Dignity
Empower people to cope and recover with dignity through humanitarian action that puts people at its heart, delivers equally for women and girls, reaches everyone, invests in youth and children, and protects and enables people as the primary agents of their own response.
Safety
Keep people safe from harm by putting protection at the centre of humanitarian action, increasing political action to prevent and end conflict, preventing and putting an end to violations of international humanitarian law, and ensuring humanitarian action is not instrumentalized.
Resilience
Build hope and solutions for people in new or prolonged crises through collective action by humanitarian, development and other partners to strengthen people's resilience to crises, by investing in preparedness, managing and mitigating risk, reducing vulnerability, finding durable solutions for protracted displacement, and adapting to new threats.
Partnerships
Build diverse and inclusive partnerships that reaffirm the core humanitarian principles, support effective and people-driven humanitarian action, enable first responders to take a leadership role, and leverage the power of innovation.
Finance
Ensure sufficient and more efficient use of resources to preserve life, dignity and resilience in crises through new and diverse funding sources and expanded support to local organizations.
Towards Istanbul
The consultations have generated a demand for a vision of a world whose fundamental humanity is reaffirmed and restored.
The Summit will take place within an unprecedented global drive for change. It is situated within the push for the renewal of global frameworks for disaster risk reduction (Sendai, March 2015), sustainable development (New York, September 2015), climate change (Paris, December 2015), and urban development (Quito, October 2016). It will also benefit from the reviews of the UN peacebuilding architecture (June 2015), UN peace operations (also June 2015), and the Women, Peace and Security agenda (October 2015); the High-Level Panels on Humanitarian Financing (November 2015) and the Global Response to Health Crises (December 2015); and the 32nd International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent (Geneva, December 2015). Finding new ways to address humanitarian needs and to comprehensively manage risk will be a critical part of this global agenda.
Migrants looking for a better life
The UN SG must be applauded for overseeing a complex and exhaustive process setting the context for Global change.
As one looks closer a few concerns emerge. The huge consultations in 2015 links somewhat inadequately with the need to take on board the strengths of citizens who when given the tools can be a very powerful force in situations of recovery of victims. The same is true about attracting resources of citizen's, corporates etc. For example in Sri Lanka they are prescribed Government designated funds which attract tax concession for those contributing. However if a prioritized Social Responsibility regime is compiled with corresponding tax free concessions it will attract considerable resources.
Globally disasters are striking ever so frequently not only due to natural causes but also by ever increasing human triggered causes. The international regime representative of the entities shown earlier quite struggles to cope.
A Group of Global Experts have prepared a submission for the session on IDPs and is reflective of the urgent call for greater global institutional leadership. The key points are:
1) Higher priority among national governments, international organizations and donors to IDPs as a population of special concern during conflict. While there has been great progress since the promulgation of the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, there are still problems in gaining access to IDPs during conflict, which presents barriers to delivery of life-saving humanitarian assistance.
There are also far too many IDPs who have been displaced for decades, often living in camps or with little access to mainstream services in urban areas. The SG's report can reinforce that concerted effort on the part of the entire international community is needed to address these problems: to ensure access to all IDPs and to find solutions for IDPs as soon as is practicable. Setting goals of a) increasing the proportion of IDPs with access to assistance and protection by 50%, and b) reducing the number of IDPs in protracted situations by 50% could be an effective way to raise visibility of these issues.
2) Institutional reforms to enhance the protection of IDPs both in situations of armed conflict and disasters. Many at the workshop noted need for a 'visible face' for the protection of IDPs. Whether because of the downgrading of the position of Special Representative to Special Rapporteur or because of the limits of the strictly human rights approach, there appears to be a vacuum of leadership in bringing attention to the needs of IDPs. At the same time, the cluster system has improved responses in many humanitarian crises but protection of IDPs remains a weak link in the response system.
UNHRC's willingness to lead the protection cluster for conflict IDPs is welcome but UNHRC faces numerous barriers to its ability to fulfill its responsibilities. These include its lack of a clear mandate regarding IDPs (as compared to its strong mandate regarding refugees), inadequate financial support from donors for its work on IDPs, and security constraints in reaching IDPs as well as other conflict affected populations. The problems UNHRC faces are compounded by the weak role that some humanitarian coordinators play with regard to protection of IDPs.
The Secretary-General in his report should recognize the important role that the humanitarian coordinators and the protection cluster could play with adequate support and pledge that he will make serious efforts to strengthen their activities in this area or make changes in the institutional architecture. The report should also call on donors to increase the funding that they provide for assistance and protection of IDPs and do so in a way that does not diminish their support for other vulnerable populations such as refugees. Finally, the report could urge that there be regular briefings or reports to the Security Council by the Emergency Relief Coordinator on barriers to access to IDPs and others at risk in their country and ways to overcome them.
3) The Secretary-General should urge regional bodies to adopt declarations and conventions on IDPs, citing the Kampala Convention as a model and promote implementation of these instruments. He should also urge governments to adopt national laws and frameworks based on the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement and develop country strategies -- together with donor governments, international organizations, civil society and IDPs themselves -- to implement the agreed goals and work toward resolving displacement situations.
4) Because displacement has many phases, including return, settlement and reintegration, the SG should strongly encourage an early role for development actors in conflict situations as well as an enhanced role for outside political actors, so that situations of mass displacement can be in part prevented or reduced and more effectively resolved. The report should prioritize efforts to support self-reliance and economic initiatives so IDPs do not need humanitarian assistance for prolonged periods. These initiatives should be undertaken in ways that support IDPs and host communities and involve, as much as possible, local governments and civil society organizations.
As a particularly vulnerable population, the fate of IDPs rests with the strong commitment of the international community to work with governments to ensure adequate protection, assistance and solutions. The WHS is the perfect forum to reinvigorate the role of the international community in this regard.
The Pope for example during his very recent visit to the US had to specifically make reference to climate change in his address to Congress. A forgotten dimension in definitions is the fact poverty is a disaster for those affected given an very uncertain existence every day whilst even farmers, fisherman also face seasonal disasters. Ultimately the menu of reasons bringing people together in Geneva and next year in Istanbul requires states to act within, collectively regionally, the UN system needs to be much more effective to stay relevant and global action requires Governments, corporates, non-profits and citizens to act in tandem. This is a tough act.
