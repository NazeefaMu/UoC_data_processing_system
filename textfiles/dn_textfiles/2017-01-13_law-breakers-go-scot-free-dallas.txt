Law breakers go  scot free: Dallas

The arrest of the Jathika Nidahas Peramuna (JNP) Leader MP Wimal Weerawansa amounts to political victimisation of the government's opponents. But those who break the law on behalf of the government go scot free, Parliamentarian Dalla Alahapperuma said.
He said as members of the Joint Opposition, they are against the reasons adduced by the FCID to arrest Parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa.
Alahapperuma said in the eyes of the Joint Opposition, Weerawansa is a political prisoner. Alahapperuma said the government seemed to be bending the law to suit its own whims and fancies. Although Weerawansa and the State Engineering Corporation Deputy General Manager were taken into custody, the Deputy Minister and the Chairman had been left alone because they were on the government side.
He said as regards the Hambantota incident, he would challenge the government to screen the video footage recorded in the drone taken into custody by police so that the people could decide whether the government or the Joint Opposition version of the episode was true.
Alahapperuma expressed these sentiments at a press conference held by the Joint Opposition at the Borella Dr. N.M. Perera Memorial centre on Wednesday.
