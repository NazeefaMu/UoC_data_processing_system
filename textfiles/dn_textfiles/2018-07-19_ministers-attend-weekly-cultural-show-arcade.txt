Ministers to attend weekly cultural show at Arcade

Project Management, Youth Affairs and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka and Tourism Development Minister John Amaratuga had made plans to attend the weekly cultural show on Friday (20) evening at Arcade Independence Square, Colombo.
The Tri-forces and the National Youth Services Council (NYSC) had recently commenced a weekly cultural show at Arcade Independence Square, Colombo, every Friday.
The project, initiated by the Prime Minister’s Office, is being supported by the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA). It was also in line with the Tourism Strategic Plan’s (2017 - 2020) recommendation to expand entertainment opportunities for tourists and locals visiting Colombo.
The cultural show, starting at 7.00 pm every Friday, includes musical performances by military and NYSC bands, dancing items, as well as other entertainment. The Prime Minister’s Office said the public could witness the show free-of-charge.
Project Management, Youth Affairs and Southern Development Minister and Prime Minister’s Chief of Staff Sagala Ratnayaka, commenting on the initiative, said it was only the start, and that the concept would be further-developed based on feedback from the public.
“There has been a positive response from the public so far. Those who witnessed the show last Friday were excited by the idea and considered it a fresh start. But we want to add more colourful cultural elements to the show as we move along,” the minister said.
He added that it would help familiarise tourists and locals with the cultural roots of the country.
“We, as Sri Lankans, have a rich cultural heritage and a knack for good music and entertainment. From a tourism perspective, this offers a glimpse of our colourful life. At the same time, it gives an entertainment for those who gather around Independence Square on Fridays just to unwind,” the minister added.
The project is being coordinated by Coordinating Advisor to Prime Minister’s Office Major General Mihindu Kulasuriya.
