BBS Coordinator alleges assassination plot against Ven.Galagoda Aththe

Bodu Bala Sena(BBS) Chief Executive Officer and Coordinator Dilantha Withanage said yesterday that details of an assassination plot against BBS General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera by an outfit similar to that of the Islamic State or ISIS terrorist group have been revealed.
Addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, he said the group has even carried out several dry runs for the alleged assassination of Ven. Thera.
“We have already complained to the CID in this regard and an investigation has been launched.
Withanagesaid that the Ven.Thera has suggested that the Sinhala and Muslim communities should discuss and resolve their differences, but several journalists representing the Muslim extremists have distorted the Ven. Thera’s views.
“Thereafter, certain Muslim politicians are allegdly engaging in spreading extremism have turned these media reports to their advantages. They also create a wrong picture against us in internality. Nobody wants to understand the gravity of the problem and solving it.But,they always allege the BBS for the actions taken to defend the Sinhala Buddhists,” he said.
“There is a big media campaign against the Ven.Thera. This campaign is run with the funds provided by the Muslim extremists who have already gained a foothold in every media institution.The assassination of the one Bhikku may not be a big thing, but who is going to take responsibility for the unrest that may follow,? Withanage asaked.
“There is some evidence about the activities of several outfits connected to the ISIS in Sri Lanka. Therefore, the government should take measures to provide security to Ven. Thera,”the Bodu Bala Sena Chief Executive officer and Coordinator said.
“There is no warranty against the Ven.Thera. It is only a statement that is to be obtained from him. Eventhough he had informed the Police that he would present himself to the Police on Monday, the Police had tried to arrest him on Saturday. There were many allegations aginst the Police and politians with regard to a number of assassinations and abductions that took place in the country in the past,” he said.
“A Minister who allegedly gets funds from Doha, Qatar for spreading Muslin extremism and Wahhabism is responsible for all these problems,” Withanage said, while making many allegations with regard to the Wilpattu issue as well.
“A report compiled during the Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratung Presidency in 2002 revealed how these Muslim extremists had vandalised and destroyed Buddhist place of worships and artifacts,” he alleged.
“But, nobody had taken action against those responsible for these alleged destructions. We urge both the President and Prime Minister to read this report and ascertain the scle of the destructions caused by Muslim extremists,” Withanage added.
“We are continuously receiving complaints from the Sinhala people about the alleged destructions of Buddhist temple and forcible acquiring of their lands by Muslims.We will set up a special center to receive such complaints and providing legal advise to them after studying the facts.
We will take legal action against journalists who have distorted our views. Not only the Sinhala Buddhists, but also Tamil people have been affected by the actions of Muslim extremists,” Withanage alled. Therefore, We will join hands with the Sri Lanka Hindu Federation to face these problems. We invite all peaceful Muslims and Catholics to join hands with us in this endeavour,” he added.
Sri Lanka Hindu Federation President N.Arunkaanth said that over 61 Hindu temples have been destroyed by the Muslim extremists in the East. It was the BBS members who supported us to erect a statue of the first Professor of Tamil Swami Vipulananda in the East despite the disturbances of the Muslim extremists’ in the Province. India will never allow its Hindu identity to be erased. So why are we allowing our Buddhist identity to be erased? Arunkaanth queried.
