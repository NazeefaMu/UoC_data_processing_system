GDP growth in the 1st quarter of 2017 fell sharply to 3.8% Y-o-Y (5.1% Y-o-Y in Q1’16 and 4.4% in FY’16) as the island-wide drought since 2016 negatively impacted the economic activity, particularly agricultural activity.

However, the Monetary authority expects growth to rebound to 7.0% Y-o-Y by 2020E with the private sector expected to play a key role in achieving this future growth.
