Treasury Bond issue: Auditor General ordered to audit secondary TB market transactions

The Presidential Commission Inquiring into the Treasury Bond Issue yesterday made an order to the Auditor General to conduct an audit on the secondary Treasury Bond market transactions from February 1, 2015 to March 31, 2016.
The application was made by Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunatilake. He requested the commission to issue an order for an audit to test out if losses have been incurred by the government when the Treasury Bonds of the February 27, 2015 auction were sold in the secondary Treasury Bond market.
Legal Counsels Chanaka de Silva and Nihal Fernando PC objected to the application. Fernando PC said such an audit is outside the Commission’s mandate.
Commission Chairman, Supreme Court Justice K.T. Chitrasiri said such an audit falls within the commission’s mandate.
