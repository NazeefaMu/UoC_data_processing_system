Sharing the  Shakespearean flame

No matter what profession you practice, no matter what occupies you within the day, if you find that silent flame within their heart which lights the path to any form of art, you should kindle it further
Reliving the masterpieces of William Shakespeare– the 16th century conqueror of English literature– the Shakespeare Theater Festival 2017 is well prepared to bring out the essence of his works for Sri Lankan enthusiasts from December 11 to 18 at the Maradana Tower Hall Theater, Colombo 10.
The greatest Shakespearean productions – Macbeth (English and Sinhala productions), Othello (English and Sinhala productions) and Hamlet (Sinhala production) are planned to be unfolded as the director of the creations,Obinamuni Gamini De Silva celebrates 40 years of Shakespeare Theater life.
The festival also includes Shakespeare Challenge 2017 Award Ceremony with the categories: Drama, Quiz, Oratory, Translation and Essay. The best three plays of the competitions, selected from schools throughout Sri Lanka will also be performed.
De Silva is the initiator of The Shakespeare Center, Sri Lanka – a community which was created in order to encourage theater in Sri Lanka and to widen the knowledge of Shakespearean Theater Art and Literature.
“We are a team which is bound to fulfill our duties and responsibilities for the Theater and we do so with discipline,” said De Silva at the press conference which was held recently at the Institute of Sinhala Culture, Colombo 07. “We try to bring the developed concepts of English literature into our own literature,” said De Silva.
A silent but passionate mission
“Killing oneself would be a better idea than practicing theater in this country, nowadays,’ said actor Sarath Dikkubura, who was also present at the event. And he proceeded to mention how, despite this fact, the Shakespeare Center carried out the very duty with no financial advantages.
"We contribute to Theater however we can and one of our main intentions is to spread Theater in education by welcoming young, talented students into our art. Our duty is not only to contribute to theater, but also to reveal the depth of art and literature to our future generations. Through the programmes we are planning for the future, we hope to do a well-meaning service to the Theater and through that, to the children of the country.”
Actors under the skin
People from various professions contribute to theater because they like the essence they can add to the society through it, said Yajish Thennakoon, Attorney at Law. He has been a part of the Shakespeare Center community for two years. “We are fortunate to be a part of this,” he said.
“Various professionals come together in this and have been able to attract global attention,” De Silva confirmed. De Silva and his team were invited to stage their ‘Othello’ English production at Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) in Stratford-Upon-Avon – the town where Shakespeare was born – for the 400th Shakespeare Commemoration Theater Festival.
Shakespeare Center Sri Lanka was nominated by the United Nations Volunteers as Sri Lanka’s only voluntary institute for drama and is recognized by the International Theater Institute and Royal Shakespeare Company.
In addition, De Silva mentioned that the measures are underway to produce ‘Othello’ in Tamil. He is also working on bringing ‘Hamlet’ onto the silver screen by 2018. The team also produced the operatic ‘Macbeth’ in 1992.
Shakespeare Drama Competitions were started in schools by Shakespeare Center in 1993 and have been carried out to this day. “We show no mercy in our quizzes,” said De Silva, convincing the thoroughness of the competitions. This was an attempt to situate theater activity and Shakespearean literary corners in the school curriculum. “I consider it my duty to hand over this task to the next generation,” he added.
“The reason why Shakespeare’s creations have made it to the 21st century from the 16th is the subculture he brings out through his works,” actor Jayalal Rohana said. The language Shakespeare uses in his literature is a blend of Latin and Persian. He has added more than 3,000 words to the English language. “You could study one page of his works and write a book about it. Gamini De Silva does that very task in theatre form,” Rohana added.
The Shakespeare Theater Festival 2017 is one such attempt in decades of service and this endeavor will go on, one step after the other, carrying eager artists forward with it. Tickets for the festival are now available at ''Sinhala Cultural Center'', Bauddhaloka Mawatha, Colombo 07.
To move forward, Rohana said, what you need is courage. “Bear in your heart just enough unfailing courage, and you will go a long way in this deep, wonderful art,” he said.
No matter what profession you practice, no matter what occupies you within the day, if you find that silent flame within their heart which lights the path to any form of art, you should kindle it further. If you see with the eyes of an artist, you should reserve time, will and strength to it and you should fuel that flame till it burns your soul.
