Taste without Sugar!

Nutrition plays a critical role in every stage of our lives. From conception through pregnancy, birth, childhood and into old age nutrition will promote a healthy and a good life. Nutrition also plays an integral part of management of diseases. Many diseases, especially Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs), could be largely prevented and controlled with proper nutrition.
The Health Ministry declared the month of June as the National Nutrition Month under the theme `Taste without sugar'. During this month, it is expected to reduce consumption of sweetened beverages among all age groups and to create awareness among the people regarding the harmful health issues that arise due to addiction to sugar and sweetened beverages. Dr. Renuka Jayatissa, Head of Nutrition Department, Medical Research Institute, Ministry of Health, Colombo joined the Daily News Health Watch to voice that too much sugar is not so sweet on your health.
Q: How do Non Communicable Diseases affect life in Sri Lanka?
A: The country, at present faces escalating health care costs with rising rates of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as heart disease, diabetes, cancers, and asthma among many others. NCDs have already become the largest contributor to disease burden in Sri Lanka, accounting for 85 per cent of ill health, disability and early deaths. In Sri Lanka, non-communicable diseases cause more than three quarters of all deaths and nearly one in five people die prematurely from NCDs. This burden of NCDs which has now become a serious economic as well as public health issue in Sri Lanka fuelled by tobacco use, unhealthy diet, harmful use of alcohol and physical inactivity will definitely see a rise in the future.
Q: Where does Diabetes stand among the NCDs?
A: Diabetes is among the four leading Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs) that affects morbidity, mortality, and disability in the world. It was the eighth leading cause of global deaths in 2015, and is expected to advance to be the fifth cause by 2030. Importantly, the low-and middle-income countries are more vulnerable to diabetes and related deaths. Sri Lanka too is experiencing an increase in diabetes patients. According to recent statistics the prevalence of diabetes among adults in Sri Lanka is 8.5 per cent.
Q: How does sugar consumption contribute to the increase of Diabetic patients in Sri Lanka?
A: Excessive consumption of sugar is one of the contributing factors for diabetes. While it is an essential ingredient for energy; its excessive intake has negative effects. To prevent and control negative health effects of sugar among adults and children, reducing daily sugar intake is recommended.
For Sri Lanka, the recommended sugar consumption is about 25 grams/6 teaspoons of sugar per non-diabetic person per day. However, an average Sri Lankan consumes 36 grams of sugar a day and when a person consumes sweetened food and beverages this amount can more than double.
Q: What steps have been taken by the Health Ministry to tackle this issue?
A: Prevention and control are the two means to address diabetes which has plagued our society.
Globally agreed targets are set towards halting the rise of diabetes and obesity by 2025, through the increased access to affordable treatment, including insulin for those living with diabetes. In Sri Lanka, the Ministry of Health implemented a national policy for NCDs prevention.
The Ministry is also creating awareness through various campaigns such as `Taste without sugar' which will be launched on June 23 at Gampaha. Diabetes can be prevented by implementing lifestyle modifications including maintaining an age-appropriate body weight, engaging in physical activity, and consuming a nutritious diet.
A diet including fruits, vegetables, grains, lean meats, low-fat dairy products, and whole grain foods can help lead a healthy life. While reducing the sugar intake, it is also recommended to at least consume five servings of fruits and vegetables a day.
Q: How is the sugar consumption among school children addressed through such campaigns?
A: It is revealed that more than 13 per cent of children, some below 12 years are being diagnosed as pre-diabetics.
Various advertisements on food promotion inducing demand for unhealthy food products such as processed and fast foods can play a major role, in affecting healthy food habits, particularly among the children.
Thus the campaigns of `Taste without sugar' will be launched in schools with the participation of children to create awareness of the adverse effects on the excessive intake of products such as biscuits, milk products and sweetened beverages.
Q: How effective is the `Traffic lights' colour coding system introduced by the Ministry to tackle the diabetic epidemic?
A: In 2015, the government made a decision to display different colour labels for beverages to denote high sugar content. Colour coding at a glance tells the consumer if the beverages have high, medium or low amounts of sugar. Red means the drink is high in sugar and warns the public to consume with due precautions.
The ministry will expand this coding system to milk products, biscuits and other foods as well.
Finally, we as consumers have a major role to play in controlling our intake of sugar to prevent diabetes which will hinder leading a happy and a healthy of life.
