Warwicks beat Surrey to enter T20 Blast semis

LONDON: Grant Elliott scored an unbeaten 59 as Warwickshire chased 205 with four balls left to beat Surrey in the fourth T20 Blast quarter-final at The Oval.
Elliott survived a review for a catch by Rory Burns when on 46 but went on to share an unbeaten 64-run partnership with Colin de Grandhomme (39 not out).
Warwicks reached 207-4 after Surrey had earlier posted 204-5 in their 20 overs as Jason Roy top-scored (74).
They will face Glamorgan in their last-four tie at Finals Day on 2 September.
Hampshire will take on Notts Outlaws in the other semi-final at Edgbaston.
New Zealand international Elliott, captain of Warwicks after Ian Bell's decision to step down, was given not out by the on-field umpires when Burns was convinced he had caught him in the deep diving forward.
Following numerous television replays, he survived and went on to take his side into a home Finals Day.
Surrey's innings tailed away after Roy (74 off 38 balls) and Aaron Finch (39 off 27 balls) had shared a 98-run opening partnership in just 9.1 overs. Finch was forced to bat with a runner after he injured his right calf when getting off the mark.
