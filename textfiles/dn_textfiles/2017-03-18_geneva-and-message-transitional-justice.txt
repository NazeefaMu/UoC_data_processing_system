Geneva and the message of transitional justice

Europe is very much part of the political debate in Sri Lanka just now, not because of the important election result in the Netherlands this week where the far-right candidate who was expected to give a big boost to populism was given a push back, and is the subject of interest in all major democracies. Our interest is in Geneva and the resolution on Sri Lanka in the UNHRC in October 2015, which was co-sponsored by Sri Lanka, and provided guidelines for peace and reconciliation in this country, with proposals on facing the issue of alleged war crimes in the final stages of the fight to defeat the LTTE.
While Sri Lanka has made some progress on the matters of reconciliation, peace building and understanding among the communities here, there remains much to be done, which is why we have sought two years more to reach finality on the matter. While there are good indications that Sri Lanka will get these two years, the government is now faced with major opposition to its initial co-sponsoring of the relevant resolution, and especially the provision there for the likely presence of foreign judicial personnel on probes into alleged war crimes.
The opposition has got louder than when the resolution was originally passed in 2015, with the emerging signs of divisions within the government, and different views stated by leading members of the unity government on the presence of foreign judges, as suggested. President Maithripala Sirisena has clearly stated he is opposed to the presence of any foreign judges, while the Prime Minister has stated the presence of such judicial personnel is not practical in the current circumstances. The Joint Opposition has been very vocal stating that although such opinions are mentioned today, original resolution was indeed passed with co-sponsorship by this government, and showing that the government is now in a position of not being able to get away from the trap it has taken the country into.
They are wholly silent on why the government had to co-sponsor such a resolution, and take the message of peace, understanding and reconciliation that Sri Lanka was engaged in to the world, in the context of the isolation, the country had faced internationally due to the policies of the Rajapaksa Regime, which failed to build on the success of Sri Lanka in the first UNHRC resolution immediately after the war with the LTTE, and instead was making the country isolated and possibly facing sanctions and other responses by the Western-led international community.
With Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera being the voice of Sri Lanka at the UNHRC sessions in October 2015 and last month, much of the criticism of the government on the original resolution, and the new call for an extension of two years to carry out the work undertaken by Sri Lanka has been directed at him. This criticism seeks to make a bigger picture of the differences within the government, which remain a coalition of the two leading parties, and an effort to show that Sri Lanka remains wholly under the control of Western powers, and unable to carry out any independent policies on the matters of peace building after the defeat of the LTTE.
Mangala’s response
The strongest criticism of Minister Samaraweera and the policies with regard to the UNHRC resolution came from Mahinda Rajapaksa in a statement titled “Constitutional and legal reforms to destroy the nation”, which took on the key positions stated by Minister Samaraweera about the need for Constitutional and legal reform to take the country forward towards the goal of peace and reconciliation.
Minister Samaraweera did in fact make a very strong response to this, where he stated the core thinking on the policy of transitional justice, which is the main target of attack by Mahinda Rajapaksa and the JO. I quote from his response, which is the most substantial comment by any in the government on the issue of the UNHRC resolution, and also exposing the contradictions of the Rajapaksas, the JO and other critics too on the matter of transitional justice. As he says it:
“We believe that we will overcome a painful past by examining it, not by hiding it. We are convinced that we need to put a stop to the cycles of recurring violence that have hitherto hindered our progress as a proud, united country and a united people. We know that truth, reparation and justice are essential, and further, that international jurisdiction over serious crimes only applies when national jurisdiction fails. We are declaring our vision in a resolution before the world to demonstrate that, as an independent, sovereign, and responsible nation, we are fully able to pursue accountability, with our national capacities, and in cooperation with our friends and partners in the international community, thus restoring credibility to our judicial processes and building capacity.
“Let me be very clear: the transitional justice mechanisms to be implemented will not benefit one group or community above others, and will certainly not single out and target the armed forces. The former President manipulates the respect that the Sri Lankan people have for the armed forces to hide his own responsibilities. This is opportunistic, and especially ironic, coming from the person who imprisoned the commander who led the armed forces to victory.
“Everyone paid a heavy price during the conflict, including our soldiers, with patriotic devotion. It is fitting that all of us Sri Lankans enjoy the benefits of reconciliation including the families of more than 5,000 missing military personnel, and the families of missing policemen whose whereabouts will be sought by the Office on Missing Persons.
“Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, especially as a lawyer, is very well aware that the issue of foreign judges is mere exaggeration on his part, and he does this on purpose to mislead the public. Let us not forget that it was under his leadership that multiple transitional justice processes were initiated, and international prosecutors were engaged. The International Independent Group of Eminent Persons (IIGEP) established by him engaged foreigners invited by him, and also nominated by Australia, Canada, the European Commission, UK, Japan, the Netherlands, USA, the Inter-Parliamentary Union, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), and a Cypriot nominated by the Government of Sri Lanka. International prosecutors were also engaged in connection with the Paranagama Commission. Moreover, implementation of the thirteenth amendment to the constitution was for the first time made into an international pledge under his leadership through the much touted victory resolution S-11/1 sponsored by Sri Lanka and adopted on 27th May 2009 by the UN Human Rights Council. The resolution welcomed the “reassurance given by the President of Sri Lanka that he does not regard a military solution as a final solution, as well as his commitment to a political solution with implementation of the thirteenth amendment to bring about lasting peace and reconciliation in Sri Lanka.”
Indian Ocean safety
The capture of a foreign ship, flying a flag of the Comoros, with a Sri Lankan crew on it, has raised the issue of security in the Indian Ocean, which is becoming a matter of increased importance to the Asian region. President Sirisena, who participated in the Indian Ocean Rim Summit held recently in Indonesia, would have been apprised of the need for increased joint action by countries of the Indian Ocean region, to ensure the safety of the important sea routes that impact on global trade.
The latest piracy in Somalia gives much weight to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe proposition to hold an Indian Ocean maritime security summit to address emerging threats and consider action against maritime terrorism. He made this proposition during his recent visit to Australia, when delivering the Deakin Law School’s annual oration; he said Sri Lanka was willing to hold such a summit in order to establish ways to promote peace and freedom of navigation in the Indian Ocean.
It was his view that the proposed summit should have the participation of countries located around the Indian Ocean, member countries of the United Nations Security Council and major maritime organisations. He also proposed the introduction of a code of conduct should be for warships sailing in the Indian Ocean.
There is the encouraging news that the Sri Lankans who are held in the pirated vessel are safe, and that the military forces of Puntland in Somalia have initiated action to release the vessel and crew. But, there is also the fact of ransom being demanded by the pirates for the release of the vessel and crew, which makes this a matter for careful negotiation that may take some time, as seen in other such piracies in by Somalians in recent years.
Closer home, the importance of security in the Indian Ocean region assumes increased importance with the increase in international trade, and Sri Lanka is faced with another issue in these waters over the continued entry of South Indian fishermen to Sri Lanka’s territorial waters, causing much loss and damage to the Sri Lankan fishing community. Any discussions on Indian Ocean security will also have to take up this matter, which has to bring out the best response from both India and Sri Lanka.
