THE QUESTION OF AFTERLIFE
Dr. Asoka Thenuwara, in reply to my letter of May 7, offers an opinion: ‘Buddhism stresses the utmost urgency in terminating the rebirth process [afterlife] here and now. ‘He continues with a query: ‘For me the question of afterlife is irrelevant and has devoted my entire life for full-time meditation for the single purpose of ending of Samsara [continuation of life] here and now because there is no choice.’
I cannot understand when he says ‘afterlife is irrelevant’ and at the same time speaks of Samsara – continuation of life. Surely rebirth and Samsara are interconnected as there cannot be a Samsara without a rebirth to tread the journey. Samsara.
Having said that, I still maintain Heaven, Nirvana and Hell are imaginary places meant to discipline, drill fear into people. We have been taught that those who do good or meritorious acts go to heaven and those who do evil would go to hell or be born again to continue life on Samsara till reaching eternal bliss, the end of rebirth. Buddhism brings in another fear or reward in rebirth and Samsara.
Here is a hypothetical case which came to my mind while writing this letter. Queen Elizabeth is the Head of State of United Kingdom. According to those who believe in rebirth, she may have performed meritorious acts in her previous births in Samsara to be born as a queen and live in luxury with pomp and glory. Then why was she born to be the head of the Church of England a branch of Christianity, which beliefs in God the Creator and not what is preached in Buddhism – Karma?
As I always said and maintain, man is born, endowed with seven senses: mouth to taste and speak, eyes to see, nose to smell, ears to hear, hands to touch and feel, legs to walk and move and mind to think and decide. Use these nature-given gifts to the full and not be a nuisance to the society and the environment you live and pass off with a feeling of happiness and contentment with no regrets, to whatever place if there is any. In short, why worry over some things which are unknown and chain yourself?
Today, all these religious, fables, tales and beliefs, rites and rituals have been classified as mythology, fictional stories that give the intelligent men some entertainment as to how our ancestors have been misled or fooled. We are now intellectually-evolved technologically-skilled people and science attempts to find physical proof for that which is unknown or not yet defined and to reject superstition and misperception in favour of observable facts. When science offers an answer, that answer is universal and we accept.
As Dan Brown, the researcher, in his book Origin states ‘The age of religion is drawing to a close and the age of science is drawing’.
Let me wind up with a saying of that greatest philosopher, the Buddha:
Do no evil, perform meritorious acts, purify your mind and such is the advice of the Buddhas.
The Buddha, in his final advice, has not spoken of heaven, hell, rebirth or samsara, but how to live this life.
