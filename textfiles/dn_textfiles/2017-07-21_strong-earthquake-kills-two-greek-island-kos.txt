Strong earthquake kills two on Greek island of Kos

 
A strong earthquake in the Aegean Sea has killed at least two people on the Greek island of Kos, officials say.
The 6.7-magnitude quake hit 12km (seven miles) north-east of Kos, near the Turkish coast, with a depth of 10km, the US Geological Survey said.
At least 20 others were injured on Kos, a popular tourist destination. Some buildings were damaged.
In the Turkish city of Bodrum, several people were injured as they tried to flee the quake.
Pictures on social media showed people in the city walking with water lapping their ankles and localised flooding, and about 70 people sought hospital treatment for minor injuries.
The earthquake struck at 01:31 on Friday (2230 GMT Thursday).
Turkey and Greece sit on significant fault lines and are regularly hit by earthquakes.
One of the deadliest in recent years hit the heavily populated northwest of Turkey, in 1999, killing some 17,000 people.
