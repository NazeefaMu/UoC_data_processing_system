Andre Russell’s amazing dual-feat in the Caribbean PL

Most players aspire to be of some help within their squad while featuring in a game. We admit that it feels pretty nice to have contributed to a team’s win, no matter how small the contribution may have been.
On the other side of this, we have Andre Russell now who reached the apex of what anyone would have thought as doable in a T20 cricket match - and how! A 40-ball-ton, a last-over hat-trick, and a splendid catch. It is even safe to say that one may feel a tad bit sorry for the rest of the side out there - having not done as much as the man alone, even collectively.
The Trinbago Knight Riders looked strong, despite losing a dangerous Chris Lynn to a brilliant Russell catch. They went on to post 225/6 in 20 overs, which would have gone even higher, had Russell not produced a spectacular effort in the final over - dismissing Brendon McCullum, Darren Bravo and Denesh Ramdin in successive balls to finish the hat-trick.
All was not well, even then as Russell’s Jamaica Tallawahs fell to 41/5 while chasing the huge score. That was when he came in to bat. Very soon, he blitzed his way through, completing a hundred in 40 balls and scoring 21 more in 9 more balls, as he successfully guided his side to an amazing win.
The mammoth knock featured 6 fours and 13 sixes, as he became the only second T20 player after Joe Denly to achieve the twin-feat of a hundred and a hat-trick in the same game. No prizes for guessing the man-of-the-match.
