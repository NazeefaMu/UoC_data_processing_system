Housemaid in Kuwait assaulted by Lankan women

A Sri Lankan housemaid in Kuwait who was brutally assaulted by a group of Sri Lankan women working at a job recruitment branch will be brought back to the country within the next three days, Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) media spokesman Upul Deshapriya told the Daily News.
SLBFE officials who investigated the incident following a video which went viral on social media websites, said the woman had been assaulted at the Kuwait branch of a job agency located at Kurunegala.
Investigations also revealed that the victim is a resident of Polpithigama.
This is the third time she had gone to Kuwait as a house maid.
It is also reported that the woman had been admitted to hospital after falling ill while she was working at a house.
The victim is a sick woman who received treatment at the same hospital during her previous two visits. Job agency officials who were aware about her illness had sent her to Kuwait not revealing her ailment.
“The SLBFE cancelled the license of the job agency and also launched a special investigation into the incident,” Deshapriya said.
The woman is now in the custody of the Sri Lankan Embassy in Kuwait.
