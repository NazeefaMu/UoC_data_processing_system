New Acts will not bring injustice to anyone: Mustapha

The recent Parliamentary Elections Amendment Act and Provincial Councils Amendment Act will not be disadvantages to any community and will bring a halt to the ugly political culture that is prevalent today, said Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faizer Mustapha.
He added that these Acts will encourage clean, intelligent and upright persons who are answerable to the electorate to enter politics.
He expressed these views at a recent press conference for heads of Muslim media institutions which was held at the Ministry Auditorium.
At this conference, some of the heads pointed out that there were several inconsistencies and these were sorted out by the Minister. Here, a special issue of whether representatives of minority communities will be at a disadvantage was raised. The Minister clearly pointed out that such a situation will not arise because of the provisions provided in the two Acts.
