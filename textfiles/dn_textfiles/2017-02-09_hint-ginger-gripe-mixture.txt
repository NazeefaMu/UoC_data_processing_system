Hint of ginger in Gripe Mixture

J. L. Morison has enhanced its classic Gripe Mixture, adding real ginger extract to create a more effective solution for older children and adults. As children outgrow their toddler years, they can continue to enjoy the sweet, mild flavour of Morison’s Gripe Mixture with the added sweet heat of ginger- the ideal over the counter remedy for a troubled stomach.
Morison’s Gripe Mixture has been a trusted name for decades in Sri Lankan households as an infant Carminative Syrup. Although it has traditionally been the refuge of parents trying to assuage their baby’s stomach or bowel disorders, the mixture is an effective remedy to ease pain caused by acidity and flatulence for anyone.
The new Gripe Mixture for older children and adults will enrich this preparation with added natural ginger extract for more effective relief and a more definitive taste and experience. Ginger’s natural anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties will enhance the mixture’s performance by helping to increase digestive juices, neutralize stomach acids and help relieve gastrointestinal irritation.
