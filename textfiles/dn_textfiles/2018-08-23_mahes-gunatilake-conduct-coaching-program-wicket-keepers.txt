Mahes Gunatilake to conduct coaching program for wicket-keepers

Efficient glovesman Mahes Gunatilake has made arrangements to conduct a coaching program for school wicket-keepers in the Kandy District. It is a good scheme and will help all budding wicket keepers to sharpen their skills. He comes on an invitation from the Kandy District Cricket Association. He is all-out to give back to the game his knowledge and the experience he gained during his cricketing career.
Malcolm Perera, former Director of Coaching at Sri Lanka Cricket and presently the chairman of coaching committee of Kandy District Cricket Association is in charge of all the arrangements.
The program is scheduled to be held on 31 August at Kingwood College Randles Hills grounds. All wicket-keepers are requested to be present in training attire by 8.30 a.m. Further details can be had from Malcolm Perera on 0772418814.
Mahes Gunatilake was the best wicket keeper the country has seen. A product of St. Anthony’s College he led the school side in 1971. When we talk about the best wicket-keepers, the first name that comes to mind is none other than the legendary Kandy wicket keeper and right hand batsman Mahesh Gunatilake, who was the country’s first Test wicket-keeper. He played in Sri Lanka’s inaugural Test against England in 1982 and appeared in only four more Tests and six one-day internationals, before being banned by the authorities for undertaking a rebel tour of South Africa in 1982/83.
Mahes learnt his cricket from under 14, and was well guided from junior level. The school where he learnt his game St. Anthony’s College has produced many top Sri Lankan cricketers like the world’s highest wicket taker Muthiah Muralitharan and one of the best opening batsman A.C.M. Lafir. In the mid 1920’s they had a great batsman by the name of Jack Anderson. Anderson played from 1916 to 1920, which was the school’s golden years of cricket. It was called the Anderson era because he was a hero in almost every game that was played in those days.
Gunatilake was the first Antonian to play in an official test match. Some of his school team mates were Merril Dunuwille, Jayantha Monnekulame, Premalal de Silva, Terrance Sims, Merril Guneratne, Suresh Gunatilake his brother, Bernard Ranasinghe, Philomen Raj and Jack Robertson.
