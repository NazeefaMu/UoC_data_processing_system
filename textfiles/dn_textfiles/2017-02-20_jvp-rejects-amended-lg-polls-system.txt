JVP rejects amended LG polls system

The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) yesterday rejected the proposed amendments to the local government electoral system stating that it doesn’t properly address the People’s wishes.
JVP leader Anura Dissanayake addressing the media in Colombo said new system could affect the chances of the JVP at future elections.
He said no one could justify trying to sideline a political party using a flawed electoral system.
“This new proposed system will not only hurt the JVP, but it will badly hurt the cherished objective of the country’s voting system – representative democracy”, he said.
The JVP leader said the percentage ratio proposed to elect members through proportionate and first past the post system would not confirm the democratic rights of the masses.
Under the new system a party which wins a local authority with 51 percent of the vote will obtain 77 percent of the seats. And the party which obtains 49 percent and loses the local body will only receive 23 percent of the seats, he said.
He also noted a lot of grey areas are in the proposed system and urged the government to hold the LG polls under the present system if authorities cannot come up with a system to address the the people’s wishes. The proposed amendments to the local government electoral system are intended to end the current preferential voting system to elect members to local government bodies. The new system is a mixture of the proportional representation system and first past the post system, he said.
