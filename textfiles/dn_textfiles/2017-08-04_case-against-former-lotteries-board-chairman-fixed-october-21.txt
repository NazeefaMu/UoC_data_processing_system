Case against former Lotteries Board chairman fixed for October 21

The Colombo Chief Magistrate yesterday fixed for October 21, the case against former Development Lottery Board (DLB)Chairman Dr. Chandrawansa Pathiraja for allegedly causing a sum of Rs.23 million unlawful loss to the DLB when awarding promotional activities pertaining to several lottery tickets to three private companies contrary to the accepted tender procedure.
When the case came up before Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara, parties were directed to file their written submissions regarding the objections raised by defence over prosecution’s attempt to amend the charge sheets during the trial.
The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed this case against former DLB chairman under Section 70 of the Bribery Act.
The Commission further alleged that the former Chairman had awarded promotional activities to the private companies between November 2014 and December 2014 in violation of the law.
