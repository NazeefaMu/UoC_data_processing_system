Kataragama pilgrims inconvenienced by errant trishaw drivers

Pilgrims visiting Kataragama are allegedly inconvenienced by high rates charged by three-wheeler drivers.
They had allegedly charged between Rs. 500 and 750 to go to Kirivehera, Rs. 150 to 200 to go to Kataragama, both which are around one kilometre from the town.
Residents urge authorities to take necessary steps to equip three-wheelers with meters.
