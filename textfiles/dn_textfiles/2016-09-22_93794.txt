Destructive Bens pair  rout Kotte Thomians

 
St Benedict’s College pair Yohan Soysa and Lankaja Ratnayake bowled their school to victory with an excellent double in their under 13 school cricket match against St Thomas’ College Kotte played at Kotahena.
Soysa hit a sparkling 148 off 132 balls inclusive of 23 fours and six sixes and with Ratnayake (50 n.o. off 132 balls, 3 fours) shared a partnership of 212 for the fourth wicket helping St Benedict’s recover from a disastrous start of 15 for three wickets to post a challenging total of 227-4.
When the Kotte Thomians began their reply they were confronted again by the same pair that had tormented them with the bat.
Soysa with his off-breaks and Ratnayake bowling left-arm leg-spin took eight wickets between them as the Kotte Thomians were shot out for 69 to hand out to the Bens a comprehensive win by 158 runs.
Soysa performed the rare double of scoring a century and taking five wickets in an innings in a match.
Scores:
St Benedict’s 227-4 decl in 52.1 overs (Yohan Soysa 148 n.o., Lankaja Ratnayake 50 n.o., Tharuksha Ashel 2/21)
St Thomas’ 69 in 40 overs (Virul Kethaka 16, Lankaja Ratnayake 3/19, Yohan Soysa 5/11)
