SLC launches L/O and T20 tournaments in gala ceremony

A gala opening ceremony was held by Sri Lanka Cricket at the R Premadasa Stadium on Tuesday to launch its major tournaments for 2016/17 - the Limited overs and the T20.
“I believe these tournaments have contributed to uplift cricket in Sri Lanka in the past years. That is why we think of giving priority to the club matches. Only one team will win the championship but our aim is to treat all the players as winners,” said Sri Lanka Cricket President Thilanga Sumathipala who was the chief guest at the occasion.
“Between 400-500 players who will be involved in the tournaments are lucky, because they were selected from 20 million people in the country. Today 100 players are with us on a contract basis. We expect these players to become our future through determination and dedication,” he said. “We have supported cricket clubs with infrastructure facilities and we expect to support them in the future as well. We will study the performances of all the players who participate in this tournament and record the performances of each player.”
Twenty-three clubs will clash with each other in the one-day and T20 championships. Sri Lanka Cricket will present two of the latest Renault KWID motorcars to the best players of the one day and T20 championship and, the best club of the year will receive the latest 16-seater Nissan van.
SLC vice president K. Mathivanan, Tournament Committee chairman Bandula Dissanayake and Test cricketer Rangana Herath and the players representing the participating clubs were also present at the occasion.
