AIA Insurance tops MDRT in Sri Lanka Crosses the 100 member mark!

AIA Sri Lanka has crossed 100 MDRT (Million Dollar Round Table) members for 2016, making it the first and only insurer in Sri Lanka to do so! AIA has the most number of MDRT members in Sri Lanka, with a total of 110 MDRT certificates awarded to AIAWealth Planners and Bancassurance Executives in 2016. This achievement is testament to the high calibre of advisors recruited, trained and employed by AIA, to provide the best protection and savings solutions to Sri Lankans.
This is the second consecutive year that AIA tops MDRT from Sri Lanka. MDRT is internationally recognised as the standard of excellence in the life insurance and financial services business. Its members are required to generate a certain high level of premium, commission and income and demonstrate exceptional professional knowledge, strict ethical conduct and exceptional client service. This achievement is therefore a fitting acknowledgement of the relentless commitment and the high level of professionalism shown by AIA’s advisors who, for the second successive year, helped AIA Insurance become #1 MDRT in Sri Lanka.
CEO Pankaj Banerjee said, “We are in the business of helping people protect their families, access the best healthcare and enjoy their retirement to the fullest - this is no easy task and it is truly commendable that our advisors are able to not only positively impact people’s lives but also be recognised as being the best of the best". He added, “Our advisors are renownedfor providing the highest standards of professional service and we continue to support their development by offering high quality training programmes, hiring and retaining top talent and providing the most advanced tools for enhanced efficiency and productivity.”
Deputy CEO Upul Wijesinghe who is AIA’s Chief Agency Officer stated “We adopt a diligent process when recruiting to ensure we have the very best joining our team. We also have an intense and holistic training process to ensure 100% competence as well as the necessary technology in place to enable ease-of-doing-business for the Wealth Planners as well as the customers.”
Director of Partnerships Amal Perera, said “We currently work with some of the leading banks in the country; NDB Bank, DFCC Bank and Standard Chartered Bank, to help provide greater value to their customers. We prioritize specialized training and development for our Bancassurance Sales Executives, who are armed with seamless, state-of-the-art, point-of-sale technology to help them carry out their business in an efficient and customer-friendly manner.” He added, “As the largest Bancassurance provider in the country, we are proud of the superlative service we provide to our partner banks and we hope to continue to grow in size and strength.”
AIA invests heavily in training and in new technologies that place their advisors above industry standards while taking every effort to enhance the customer experience. With a roll out of next generation systems in the pipelines, AIA’s doors are always open to advisors who have what it takes to join the distinguished list of MDRT members and work together with AIA in making a real difference.
