The metamorphosis of Bob Dylan

On October 13, 2016, Sara Danius, Permanent Secretary of the Nobel Committee of the Swedish Academy, delivered the news to applause and acclamation: “The Nobel Prize in Literature for 2016 is awarded to Bob Dylan for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition”. Speaking on behalf of the Committee, Danius invoked the poets of ancient Greece:
“If you look back, far back, 2,500 years or so . . . you discover Homer and Sappho, and they wrote poetic texts that were meant to be listened to, they were meant to be performed, often together with instruments, and it’s the same way with Bob Dylan. But we still read Homer and Sappho . . . and we enjoy it, and same thing with Bob Dylan. He can be read, and should be read.”
In his Nobel Lecture, however, delivered on June 5, 2017, Dylan gently and allusively corrected Danius: “songs are unlike literature. They’re meant to be sung, not read”.
Homeric poem
That lecture, now published as a slim elegant book, is Dylan’s account of where his art came from. The bulk of it focuses on three books out of many, read back in “grammar school”, from which Dylan acquired “prin­ciples and sensibilities and an informed view of the world”. He names Herman Melville’s Moby-Dick (1851), Erich Maria Remarque’s All Quiet on the Western Front (1929), and Homer’s Odyssey. Here we find Dylan’s acknowledgement for the first time of what his fans have realized since 2012, when they googled Dylan’s new lyrics and got fragments of Robert Fagles’s 1996 translation of the Homeric poem. The first paragraph, below, taken from the Nobel Lecture, is about Odysseus; the second, about Dylan himself:
He’s always being warned of things to come. Touching things he’s told not to. There’s two roads to take, and they’re both bad. Both hazardous. On one you could drown and on the other you could starve. He goes into the narrow straits with foaming whirlpools that swallow him. Meets six-headed monsters with sharp fangs. Thunderbolts strike at him. Overhanging branches that he makes a leap to reach for to save himself from a raging river. Goddesses and gods protect him, but some others want to kill him. He changes identities. He’s exhausted. He falls asleep, and he’s woken up by the sound of laughter. He tells his story to strangers. He’s been gone twenty years. He was carried off somewhere and left there. Drugs have been dropped into his wine. It’s been a hard road to travel.
In a lot of ways, some of these same things have happened to you. You too have had drugs dropped into your wine. You too have shared a bed with the wrong woman. You too have been spellbound by magical voices, sweet voices with strange melodies. You too have come so far and have been so far blown back. And you’ve had close calls as well. You have angered people you should not have. And you too have rambled this country all around. And you’ve also felt that ill wind, the one that blows you no good. And that’s still not all of it.
Deep winters
Ancient Rome has always mattered to Bob Dylan, from his teenage years when he saw films such as The Robe, Demetrius and the Gladiators, and Joseph L. Mankiewicz’s Julius Caesar starring Marlon Brando as Mark Antony. Dylan went for free to the cinema owned by his uncle: there wasn’t much else to do in the deep winters of Hibbing up on the iron range in the far north country of Minnesota. The fifteen-year-old Dylan, then Robert (or Bobby) Zimmerman, studied Latin and joined the Latin Club in his sophomore year. A column in the Hibbing High School newspaper, dated November 30, 1956, provides the only trustworthy detail of a day in the life of Bob Zimmerman, the future Nobel laureate, whose record disappeared from the school’s office many years ago:
Societas Latina [Latin Club] held its annual initiation party and ceremony for new members recently in the high school cafeteria. Several associated members of the club were present also.
Second-year students vied on a mock TV program, answering questions on Roman gods and goddesses and identifying words dealing with various phases of Roman life . . . . After the formal pledge of allegiance by new members, initiates received badges and were raised from the status of slave to that of plebeians. Members then adjourned to the punch bowl . . .
Ancient footprints
Consul Joe Perpich, assisted by Dennis Wickman, Bob Zimmerman, and John Milinovich, was in charge of the formal induction and radio program.
Dylan, following his first trip out of the US in 1962 to London and Rome, wrote and sang a song, “Goin’ Back to Rome”, once and only once, on February 8, 1963, at Gerde’s Folk City, Greenwich Village. It can be heard on the bootleg “Banjo Tape”, the end of the song’s first verse suggesting that the Eternal City had made its mark: “I’m goin’ back to Rome / That’s where I was born”. Seven years later came the outtake from New Morning (1970), “When I Paint My Masterpiece”, whose opening lines show Dylan in his mind back in the Rome of yesteryear: “Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble / Ancient footprints are everywhere”.
Thirty-one years after that he held a press conference in Rome (July 23, 2001), in which it was quite clear his thoughts were still with the ancient authors, particularly the greatest of the Roman poets, Virgil, whose words would be woven into “Lonesome Day Blues” from Love and Theft. And finally, fifty years after the single performance of “Goin’ Back to Rome”, Dylan put on two remarkable shows in Rome on November 6 and 7, 2013, in which he delivered the swansong for fifteen of his greatest songs, including “Boots of Spanish Leather”, “Positively 4th Street”, “Like a Rolling Stone” and “Every Grain of Sand”. Rome, where he was “born”, is the city in which he chose to put to rest some of the greatest songs ever written.
