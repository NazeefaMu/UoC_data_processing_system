Despite Ryder Cup, EPGA takes French Open down a notch

Paris, Monday: European golf chiefs on Monday delivered a blow to the hosts of the French Open by removing it from its prestigious ‘Rolex Series’.
The axe fell weeks after the Ryder Cup was staged at the Golf National which also hosts the French Open.
Traditionally held at the beginning of July the French Open next year has been moved to October 17-20.
The event’s prize money will drop from $7 million to less than $3 million.
Now being held at the end of the European golfing season, it is expected to draw a less prestigious field of players.
The Abu Dhabi Championship, which is held in mid-January, will take the French Open’s place on the Rolex Series.
