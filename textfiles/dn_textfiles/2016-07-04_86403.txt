Under-15 Division-1 tournament completes first round

Singer under 15 inter-school cricket tournament, first round of which has now been completed, was played according to a unique one-day format with four innings being played in 95 overs. Accordingly, the team batting first have the luxury of batting 65 overs the maximum if they are not bowled out and the opposition will get only 30 overs in the reply innings. This is a very tricky format because if the team batting first bat full 65 overs, the team batting second will not get sufficient overs to go for a first-innings win and therefore, their only option will be to force a draw seeking no-result points.
This situation resulted in most matches ending with no positive results in the end and the situation got more aggravate as rain too curtailed the playing hours of most matches played in the early part of the first round. However, though this new format lowered the competitiveness, it helped especially the batsmen bat with more composure and temperament to gain experience in building patient and longer innings that suits the longer format of the game of cricket. Some teams who batted second chased down big targets successfully and it was a good experience for them to learn how to be more aggressive as well attacking the bowlers in pressure situations in order to achieve big targets whilst keeping their wickets intact at the same time. Scoring of 28 centuries and completion of 115 five-wicket hauls in the first round could be considered as an encouraging plus point under this format.
After the completion of the first round, 40 teams out of the initial participation of 81were qualified to go through to the second round which too would be conducted on league basis under the same format. No team could record more than four wins of any kind and all 81 teams had at least one match ending in no-result. Royal-Colombo who topped Group D becoming the only team to record two outright wins also averaged more than 10 points in six matches they played, a feat no other team could accomplish.
