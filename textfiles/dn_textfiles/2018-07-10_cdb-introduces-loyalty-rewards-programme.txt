CDB introduces loyalty rewards programme

The always trailblazing Citizens Development Business Finance PLC (CDB) is introducing an unprecedented array of rewards throughout the year for CDB customers through its flagship loyalty programme CDB Sithumina Loyalty Rewards.
From experiencing the thrills of Disneyland and the Eiffel Tower in Paris, to the exhilarating climb of the Great Wall of China and the panoramic views of Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, CDB customers will also enjoy some inbound tours and excursions as well as mobile phones and laptops through this loyalty rewards programme. Besides its pioneering product and technology offerings and excellence in customer service, CDB has added CDB Sithumina Loyalty Rewards to recognize and augment customer loyalty.
Eligibility for the rewards programme is based on the duration of the relationship and the number of products the customer enjoys with CDB. As a prerequisite, a customer should possess more than one product to be eligible for CDB Sithumina Loyalty Rewards. Winners are selected each quarter through a raffle a. Each year, rewards will be reviewed and expanded with more exciting options. The programme is open to all existing and potential CDB customers.
Expanding on the objective of launching of CDB Sithumina Loyalty Rewards, MD/CEO Mahesh Nanayakkara reiterated that rewards of this stature are unprecedented in the local financial services industry. “For us, our customers have always been our backbone, proven undeniably with the extraordinary quantitative and qualitative results we have etched in our 20 plus year journey. We stand among the Top 6 Non-Banking Financial Institutions in the country, at top-of-mind brand recall, have been rewarded for spearheading our sustainability initiatives and been a continuous record breaker in setting benchmarks for the industry. This is all because of our portfolio of extremely loyal customers who have put their trust in us, forging long standing relationships, some of which span a decade and more. Being a relatively younger financial institution, this is a great accolade for us. It is this customer loyalty, trust and confidence that we reward through CDB Sithumina Loyalty Rewards.”
