India sends water, rice as Sri Lanka faces severe drought

With Sri Lanka experiencing one of the worst droughts in the last four decades, India has provided emergency assistance of water and rice to Sri Lanka. The government has already handed over eight water bowsers to the Sri Lankan authorities and the consignment of rice would be delivered soon.“In response to a request from the Sri Lankan government for drought relief assistance, the Indian government had announced the decision to provide eight water bowsers and 100 metric tonnes of rice to Sri Lanka.
The supply of these items is in the nature of emergency assistance to augment relief measures undertaken in the wake of the severe drought faced by Sri Lanka,” Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj told Parliament in a written reply.
The lorry-mounted water bowsers were given to the Sri Lankan government on March 21. “India has always been among the first to respond to requests from the neighbouring countries in times of crisis.
The current gifting of the water bowsers and rice is part of that policy,” Swaraj added.
Sri Lanka is suffering from the worst drought in 40 years with over a million people facing acute water shortages. The country has experienced prolonged dry season with some districts having 60 to70 percent less rainfall. The local wells and reservoirs are running dry.The harvest of rice is going to be hit due to water shortage and the prospect of rice shortage later this year is looming large.
