To stop bargaining power of TNA

SLFP says Unity Govt was imperative:
Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said that had the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) not assisted the United National Party (UNP) to form the unity government, minor parties including the TNA, which would have assisted to form this Government, may ask for a lion’s share.
The Minister made these remarks while addressing the SLFP weekly media briefing at the SLFP Headquarters yesterday.
Minister Samarasinghe said the unity government obstructed the bargaining power of the minority parties.
“There is political stability in the country owing to forming this unity government. The political stability helps attract foreign investments,” he added.
The Minister added that the decision whether to quit from the Government will be taken by the Central Committee or the Executive Committee of the SLFP but not individually.
“The decision to form a unity government was also taken by the Central Committee of the party and the decision for the departure should also be taken by the Central Committee considering the consequences by December this year,” he said.
He noted that moves are underway to form an SLFP led Government under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena by 2020.
“We will contest at next elections including the 2020 General Election under the SLFP or UPFA banner. We don’t contest with the UNP as each party has their own journey and identity” he said.
He said that under the leadership of President Sirisena, the SLFP is in progress. SLFP supporters have understood that they should be with the party rather than be with certain persons.
“There should not be two leaders at a party. Mahinda Rajapaksa, who offered the party leadership to President Sirisena, should not pull the leg of the present leader of the party.
Mahinda Rajapaksa has failed at two elections and it indicated that majority of people are not with him. Then he should not obstruct the present leader. Rajapaksa should let the party leader to bring the party forward. If Rajapaksa forms any new party while splitting the SLFP, other parties especially the UNP will get the advantage of it,” he said.
Minister Samarasinghe added that they are with the party unlike the parliamentarians of the Joint Opposition.
“We ask the persons in the joint opposition to come to the party as they are outside the party now,” he said. Sustainable Development and Wildlife Deputy Minister Sumedha G. Jayasena said she will not quit the Government even if certain media reported that she is going to quit the Government with 18 others.
Housing and Construction Deputy Minister Indika Bandaranayake refuting media reports also said that he will not leave the Government alone but the final decision is to be taken at the CC of the party. He said that he is satisfied with the ministerial activities as the Government has allocated a huge amount of money for his ministry.
Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Deputy Minister Tharanath Basnayake said that after the two year period, the CC of the SLFP will take the decision to stay or leave the Government. But he has no idea to leave the Government at this juncture.
