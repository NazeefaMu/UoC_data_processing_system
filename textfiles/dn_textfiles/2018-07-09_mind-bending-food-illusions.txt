Mind-bending food illusions

Things are not what they seem on the plates of Chef Ben Churchill. His food art is an ongoing series of optical illusions that conceal delicious desserts under the guise that they’re inanimate objects or completely different dishes.
Churchill is a master at forming his pannacotta, sponge cakes, and jellies to mimic the size and shape of what he’s trying to imitate; they look so convincing that you only realize they’re sweet treats once you dig in.
Churchill has been a chef for over 10 years, but it’s only been over the last two years that he’s tried making pastries.
“I decided to learn the basics,” he explained, “but decided to move into mimetic food, just to see what could be done. This gave me the bug to start teaching myself more and more.”
