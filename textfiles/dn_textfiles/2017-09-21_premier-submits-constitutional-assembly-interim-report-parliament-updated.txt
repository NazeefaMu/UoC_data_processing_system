Premier submits Constitutional Assembly interim report to Parliament - UPDATED

 
Chairman of the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly Prime Minister Ranil Wickremsinghe said today the country would be transformed through the new constitution while it signifies a new era of prosperity and development.
“After we came into power, we reinstated democracy ensuring equal rights to all Sri Lankans. The new Constitution is one that ensures a strong economy based on a progressive framework, where its benefits will be divided among all citizens,” the Prime Minister said, submitting the interim report of the Constitutional Assembly Steering Committee to Parliament today.
“The national government has taken another step in fulfilling the pledge made on January 8, 2015 to bring in a new Constitution. We intend to prepare a constitution that will benefit all Sri Lankans irrespective of their cast, creed or social standing. It is a constitution that will bring about a strong economy, which will benefit all. We must take this opportunity to expand our democracy and build stable peace. These are areas that were deprived to us over the past three decades. It is essential to build a strong democracy which will ensure prosperity to all,” he said.
“In order to bring in investment to generate employment that will enhance the prosperity of all Sri Lankans, a strong economy and development is essential.”
“We have now been given an opportunity to build a bridge of peace expelling division and distance between the various races, which for so long had threatened economic development being held hostage by violence and volatility for so long,” he added.
Tabling the interim report of the Constitutional Assembly Steering Committee in Parliament, the Prime Minister said it was a foundation for discussion - all parties were given the opportunity to include their ideas and suggestions:  “We formulated this collectively and everyone’s ideas and suggestions have been included in this report. We have suggested that Sri Lanka should be a unitary state,” the Prime Minister said.
According to Wickremesinghe, there are suggestions for power devolution included in the report and the country’s future would be determined by the agreement reached. He said all members are prepared to accept a united Sri Lanka, which cannot be divided. The country is currently experiencing a huge transformation in the political landscape of this country and we are travelling in a new direction, he said adding that the government supports such a change.
“We were battered by unimaginable hardships during the past three decades but now for the first time we have been given the opportunity to stand on the same platform. This dedication and commitment we make to bring about peace and stability will make a huge difference to our future generations. We cannot allow this opportunity to escape us. There is no room for revenge within our democracy. The prominence given to Buddhism within our society will be safeguarded while the foundation of our new Constitution are the principles of Buddhism. We place our trust in the Buddhist teachings that it will guide our nation,” said the Prime Minister.
He said the government would not allow anyone to inculcate fear in the minds of the people and destroy the country’s economy creating instability and division. “We have come before you with a solution. From the North to the South we have extended support in dividing power to the provinces. The Provincial Councils are known as the third level of state governance. It is a blessing that these proposals have received the approval and support of the government and the opposition. We need to discuss the presidency and executive further and a broad discussion is needed. This interim report is a joint effort, which received the support of President Maithripala Sirisena. A Constitutional Council was established to oversee the process of a new Constitution. Hence, we hope that this will create a positive dialog throughout the country. This is a historical juncture that will ensure our future generations a prosperous and peaceful nation. I expect this topic to not only be discussed within the Constitutional Council but discussed broadly among the general public throughout the country,” he said.
The Prime Minister pointed out that in the end it should be a constitution that will benefit the whole country. Hence he invited all to take part in this historical and most significant process. He said since coming into power the national government has established democracy and ensured peace and equal opportunities for all: “We ensured the rights of all where the people can now express their views without fear of persecution. The media too has been given the freedom to criticise even the government. Today the international community too has confidence that we will establish a democratic and economically strong country. This government will ensure that through the devolution of power we empower all communities creating a close bond between the government and the people. We will not allow a handful to steal our children’s future from them. This is the principle that the new constitution will be based upon,” added the Prime Minister.
