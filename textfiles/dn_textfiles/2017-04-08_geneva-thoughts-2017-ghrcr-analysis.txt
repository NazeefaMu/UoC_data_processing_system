Geneva thoughts 2017 GHRCR analysis

The 2017 Geneva Human Rights Council Report (GHRCR) contents realization is a serious and also a risky task. Its scrutinization and assimilation have to be done, in the light and the spirit of the script, titled as “Geneva Report – favourable or dangerous”, published in the Daily News of April 4th, 2017. Not so doing is fraught with misapprehension, misinformation and misrepresentation. The absorption of its right context is not recommended to be achieved, with the rhetoric of religious and political speech oration. Why?
There are two types of rhetorics: (1) Religious Rhetoric (2) Political Rhetoric. In Asian countries, the majority are used to be self-based on religious and political rhetorics and root their decision-making in them. For an instance, if a cunning man proclaims:” I was meditating in a stony cave of a remote forest and therein, a divine angel called “Real gay” suddenly appeared, causing a chilling and painful sensation across my spine. He was sent by Lord All Mighty God, to reveal His commandment of chopping the fingers and beheading the heads of the believers other religions”- immediately the man will be a messiah and there will be a sufficient crowd to blindly believe and follow the religious rhetoric of this crafty man.
The religious rhetoric deals with God. The political rhetoric is associated with what is called, the capture of power. The reader of the 2017 GHRCR must be dispensed with both above cults and follow the advice of the Buddha, taught in the discourse of “Alara Kalama”, elucidating, not to blindly believe in what others say on ten grounds. That is the only way to gain the right knowledge of 2017 GHRCR.
Report summery
The 2017 GHRCR is a document, which has assessed the progress, Sri Lanka made, in the implementation of its imposed so-called recommendations, being considered by HRC to be obligations, stemming from resolution 30/1, on the promotion of reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka between October 2015 and January 2017.
It expresses that Sri Lanka had committed to engender a reconciliation and accountability agenda and hence, it has to identify the measure and the depth of Sri Lankan efforts, needed to achieve the progress. The report proposes the Government to exercise a meaningful dialogue with pertinent stakeholders to attain to the targets of transitional justice, the reform agenda and urges the HRC to sustain a more solid investigative involvement and focused monitoring on happening developments.
Contents
The 2017 GHRCR learning cannot be complete unless one knows its full contents. Hence, the writer decided to mention them as below-mentioned: It contains six chapters. Chapter 3 has three paragraphs as A, B, C. Chapter 6 too contains three paras as A, B and C. Chapter 1 – Introduction, Chapter 2 - Engagement of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and United Nations human rights, Chapter 3 - Developments in reconciliation and accountability, Chapter 3 - A. Transitional justice Chapter 3 - B. Reconciliation, Chapter 3 - C. Emblematic cases, Chapter 4 - Preconditions for transitional justice and confidence-building measures, Chapter - 5 Other human rights issues , Chapter 6 - Conclusions and recommendations, Chapter 6 - A. Government of Sri Lanka, Chapter 6 - B. United Nations system, Chapter 6 - C. Member States.
Chapter 1 - introduction
The fundamental objective of the report is to promote the so-called reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka. The 2017 GHRCR urges to read it, not as an isolated document, but in conjunction with documents, mentioned in Part 1, carried in the Daily News. The HRC has precisely rooted itself in the resolution 30/1 and refers to comprehensive recommendations, adopted by consensus as: (a) Judicial and non-judicial measures to advance accountability and reconciliation in Sri Lanka, (b) Strengthening the protection of human rights, (c) Further reinforcement of rule of law, (d) Empirical realization of the commitment of Sri Lanka to “international community”, (e) Implementation of measures to confront the past, (f) Ending the impunity or exemption from the punishment for the perpetrated so-called crimes, (g) Steps to ascertain justice, (h) Execution of reconciliation achieving agenda, (i) Prevention of violations recurrence. The report also writes about the sources of its obtained information for its preparation: (a) information of the public, (b) Information given by various stakeholders, (c) Information provided by the Government of Sri Lanka. Here, it can well be seen, that, in gathering the required information, no proper and acceptable investigation procedure has been conducted by the HRC. Chapter 1 contains four descriptive clauses.
Chapter 2 – OHCHR engagement
The report Chapter 2 begins, describing the empirical involvement of the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Simultaneously, it reveals with a mark of appreciation, the cooperation-based engagement of the Government of Sri Lanka, particularly, during official visits, made by High Commissioner, Deputy High Commissioner and other high ranking officers, including the delegation of the Secretary General. Further it explains how the technical support was fostered, expert missions deployed and provided financial support to promote national consultation on transitional justice. The report has laid a special stress on the need to review the counter-terrorism legislation and the system of law in protecting the victims and witnesses.
In its engagement with Sri Lanka, the OHCHR corroborates its commitment, in involving such establishments as United Nations Peace-building Fund, in coordination with the United Nations country team and the Resident Coordinator. While making a mention about its close work with Sri Lanka Human Rights Commission and civil society organisations, the report boasts the collaboration, extended by the Government of Sri Lanka to the UN Human Rights Mechanisms. An important proposal eruption can be discerned from the advice of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. That is, while countering the terrorism, he has provided initial comments on the legislation meant to replace the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Descriptive Item 8). Here, the people of Sri Lanka may obtain the clue, from which blue sky, the need to amend the Prevention of Terrorism Act fell down.
A serious note must be made by Sri Lankans, as to the UN Treaty Bodies, which have been mandated to review the progress, made by Sri Lankans, in its so-called “obligations”, during the period under review: (1) the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (see CERD/C/LKA/CO/10-17); (2) the Committee on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families (see CMW/C/LKA/CO/2); (3) and the Committee against Torture (see CAT/C/LKA/CO/5).
At the end of the Chapter 2, the report welcomes the efforts, made by Sri Lanka to engage with the special procedures and the treaty bodies and encourages the Government, to set out a clear plan of action, to implement the key recommendations made by them.
Community responsibility
The Geneva HRC report is a serious and risky affair. Its impact on the country is immense. Hence, the right knowledge of its contents is a responsibility-imperative for all Sri Lankans and the sloth, torpor, lethargy and the passivity towards it, is not an intelligent option. The first is, to be in one’s own self. The problem with the majority community is, they, as a rule, are installed in a self of somebody else. And this other-self installation has found its empirical embodiment, in the psychological inclination to be subservient to political statement cult.
The real domain of people’s dwelling is not their own self, but senseless statements of the psychology of politics, who rob them, harass them and cheat them via dragging them into foolish party bifurcations, stupid religious discriminations and de-socializing cast differentiations, which benefit them nothing. Thus, if the people of Sri Lanka aspire to achieve at least something meaningful, profitable and praiseworthy, the existing political statement cult has to be caused to be ceased and gain the ability to look and realize things and events, for what they truly are.
The blind belief in what the religious priests preach and in what the politicians proclaim must cease forthwith. The intelligence has to explode and the light of right knowledge must dawn. The required lamp, for the light to reach the chambers of intelligence of the people of Sri Lanka, has already been lighted by the present writer above and he is pleased to continue fueling the lamp further for the sake of the safety of this country. Read the text, analyze it, realize same through right understanding and be decisive, resourceful and resolute at the hour of need with deeds.
