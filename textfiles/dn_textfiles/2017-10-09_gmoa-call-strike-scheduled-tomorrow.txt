GMOA call off strike scheduled for tomorrow

 
The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) has called off their strike planned for tomorrow, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo today, he said that the  strike scheduled for 8 am tomorrow was called off due to the positive response received during the special meeting held with Health Ministry Secretary and the Health Committee officials of the Public Service Commission.
During today’s meeting all parties agreed to five specific decisions. Suspending the existing Post Internship Appointment list and re-making the list through a committee with the representation of the GMOA and declaring the amended list for applications is one of the main decisions agreed by all parties during the meeting.
