Government will not burden people with further taxes: Finance Minister

“The government is not prepared to further increase the tax burden on the people. What should be done under the existing situation is to trap the non-tax payers in the net,” Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said.
The Finance Minister was addressing the 22nd annual conference of the Inland Revenue Service Association held with the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena on May 19 at the Sri Lanka Foundation.
“It is up to the people to decide whether to obtain more foreign loans as the previous regime did or to increase government revenue in order to reduce tax burden on them, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said.
. “No advice is necessary from international organisations to strengthen the country’s economy. The current administration has been maintaining the necessary financial disciplines to that effect,” the minister said.

“There is a rapid progress taking place in the Inland Revenue Department.
“We have been able to achieve this status through a creative programme supported by your views and being enhanced by modernisation, the minister said.
“At the time we took over power on January 8, 2015, the state revenue was 10.2 percnt from the GDP. With the contribution by the Sri Lanka Customs, Excise Department and Inland Revenue Department, the 10.2 percent revenue was increased up to 15.3 percent. The advantage is that such revenue would help reduce tax burden,” he said.
“We are able to prepare our own system depending on your knowledge and our confidence. The new Draft Bill will be created accordingly. Experiences from all countries will be used to create the Draft Bill. This is not created on the guidance of a particular person or entity. There is nothing included in the Bill that could harm the sovereignty of the country. No foreign country can dictate us what sectors should be taxed and what should not be taxed. It will be decided by the government. I will say with responsibility that the International Monetary Fund is not an entity that takes people hostage but an organisation constantly prepared to assist needy countries. Therefore, I assure that the Good Governance administration led by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe would never allow a harmful thing to be happened to the country, he said.
“Our tax revenue in 2012 was Rs.305 billion. It was Rs.355 billion in 2013, Rs.366 billion in 2014, Rs.421 billion in 2015 and Rs.466 billion in 2016. Our target in 2017 is Rs.609 billion. Had we collected this revenue in the past, do we need to impose VAT? Our revenue was not sufficient to repay the loan instalments at least. Then how did we go forward as a country? the minister asked. What we want is not to increase tax but to get the current tax evaders into the tax system. The current population in our country is 23 million. Of this 23 million, 48,000 are direct tax payers. When we assumed office in 2015, the total number of tax files including the Nation Building Tax and VAT were 609,000. With your commitment, this has risen up 1.5 million today,” he said.
The Minister said that when VAT percentage was increased to 15 percent, he saw it as a crime and imposed it with discontent.
“If we continue to increase tax revenue in this manner, by end of this year or possibly at the beginning of next year, we will be able to reduce VAT to 9 percent or 10 percent. I would like to remind you that it is the best commitment that we can do for the people. We are ready to do that. But what we should think again and again whether to do this by obtaining more foreign loans or increasing our revenue. How did we increase our income by 50 prcent during the past two years? Did we tax everything? No! What we did is to make a group of non-tax payers pay ta, the minister said. “Our VAT revenue in 2012 was Rs.230 billion. It was Rs. 251 billion in 2013, Rs. 275 billion in 2014, Rs.220 billion in 2015 and Rs. 283 billion in 2016. We anticipate Rs. 380 billion VAT revenue in 2017.
“However, I would like to state proudly that we were able to collect the revenue that we projected for the first five months within the first three months,” he said.
The minister said the IMF needs not to dictate Sri Lanka and the best Inland Revenue Department is functioning in Sri Lanka.
“If we need to take the country forward, what should we do is not to put hurdles in the way or conduct protests but to extend us some strength such as building a house for a needy family or provide a job to an unemployed individual at least. By doing such services only, we can be happy one day as contented public servants,” the minister said. State Finance Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena and Inland Revenue Department Director General Kalyani Dahanayake were present.
