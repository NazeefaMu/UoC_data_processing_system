Treasury Bonds issue: ‘Legal action based on findings of CID probe, Pres. Commission recommendation’

The decision as to if any legal action could be taken against the Perpetual Treasuries for alleged irregularities committed in purchasing Treasury Bonds of the Central Bank could only be taken based on the findings of investigations conducted by the Criminal Investigation Department and on evidence and recommendations of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry,the Justice Minister said in Parliament yesterday.
The Justice Minister made these observations yesterday in response to a question raised by Joint Opposition Parliamentarian Mahindananda Aluthgamage. MP Aluthgamage asked if minister was aware that the COPE – Committee on Public Enterprises has revealed that there had been some irregularities with regard to the purchase of Treasury Bonds of the Central Bank by Perpetual Treasuries.
He also queried if the CID had carried out an investigation into the incident in 2015.
Minister Rajapakshe said that the
CID had informed the Attorney General’s Department that it had not carried out an inquiry in 2015 into the issuance of Treasury Bonds in 2015.
He added that the CID investigations
are now in progress based on the instructions given by the Attorney General on October 01, 2017 in respect of a written complaint made at the IGP on November 15, 2016 regarding the issuance of Treasury Bonds by the Central Bank.
The Minister said that the decision
on any legal action would be taken only after receiving the reports of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry and findings of the CID
investigation, responding to Joint Opposition member Bandula Gunawardena who
asked if the government could give an exact time frame to obtain the results of the legal action.
