Birth of the Dragon : Kung fu nostalgia

Bruce Lee has always been a fascinating figure in the field of martial arts. To pack all of Lee into a 90 minute movie is a challenge for any filmmaker. George Nolfi overcame this hurdle when he decided to focus on one legendary fight that may or may not have happened in Lee’s life. ‘Birth of the Dragon’ deals with the story about the legendary showdown between Lee and his nemesis, the martial artist Wong Jack Man.
Set against the backdrop of 1960s San Francisco, ‘Birth of the Dragon’ is a modern take on the classic movies that Lee was known for. It takes its inspiration from the epic and rotates on the controversial showdown between an up-and-coming Lee and kung fu master Wong.
Work of fiction
The movie is a work of fiction. However the movie does not immediately zero on Lee as it should in the opening chapter. Instead it pinpoints on Steve and his love interest Xiulan. This might disappoint Lee’s fans as a majority of them would have visited the cinema to see the iconic fighter on screen.
Too much of emphasis on self realization too is evident throughout ‘Birth of the Dragon’.
Philip Ng looks good as Bruce Lee. The early swagger and the transformation later are portrayed well. Xia Yu does well as the disgraced Shaolin monk. Both actors do well in acting and fighting. However that is mostly where all the plus points end in the project. Most of the scenes are dull. Even though the fight scenes are one of the film’s strongest elements they also seem a bit cheesy at times. They reek of being over choreographed too.
Sense of fairness
Lee was well known for his generosity and sense of fairness, but Nolfi’s movie invokes an arrogant yet gifted upstart who annoyed the Chinese masters with his insistence on teaching kung fu to Westerners and disrespecting its traditions.
The film is more about Man trying to tame Lee and how the latter learns things about himself. That knowledge changes Lee for good which is how the ‘Dragon’ we see in films is born. For ardent Lee fans, this is not the biopic that they have been waiting for.
