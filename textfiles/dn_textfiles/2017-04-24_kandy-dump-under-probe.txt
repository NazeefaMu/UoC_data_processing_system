Kandy dump under probe

The National Building Research Organization (NBRO) has dispatched a team of officials to the Kandy Gohagoda dump site to examine whether there is an imminent threat of garbage mound collapsing under pressure at the site.
NBRO Landslide Research and Risk Management Division Director R M S Bandara yesterday said the team would make the necessary recommendations today to the authorities following the study. He also said the Japanese expert group that arrived in the country to study the Meethotamulla dump site might also join the research activities.
In the wake of Meethotamulla garbage dump collapse, geologists and environmentalists also cautioned the possibility of a landslide at the Gohagoda dump site to which the Kandy Municipal Council dump garbage.
About 100 tons of garbage collected daily within the municipality is being dumped at this site and it has already reached its capacity. Peradeniya University Geological Department Prof Athula Senaratne warned of a possible collapse of the dump with the rains.
“There are several slopes in the area where the dump is located. With the rains, a landslide is possible in such slopes,” he said.
The geologist pointed out that this poses an environmental threat to the Mahaweli River that flows nearby. The NBRO official said all these claims would be inspected during the study and an official announcement would be made thereafter.
When asked whether the Japanese Expert Group intimated their findings to the NBRO following the site visit at Meethotamulla dump yard, Bandara said the expert group would meet the NBRO officials today for a discussion before finalizing the report in this regard.
Meanwhile, Disaster Management Ministry Secretary S. S. Miyanawala said the report of property damages assessment carried out in Meethotamulla would be submitted this week. He noted that compensations would be paid as per these estimations. He added that the illegal occupants in the area would not receive this compensation, but added that they would still be entitled to other allowances and relief provided by the government.
