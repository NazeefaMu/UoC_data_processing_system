Sizable section within JO opposed to ‘Caretaker Government’- Vasu

There is a sizable section within the Joint Opposition (JO) who are opposed to the idea of a Caretaker Government by SLFP, JO and other stakeholders, Parliamentarian Vasudeva Nanayakkara yesterday said.
Addressing a press conference of the Socialist People’s Front at the N.M. Perera Memorial Center in Borella, Nanayakkara, said if such a move takes place, it may result in a split in the JO.
“A powerful section within the JO is opposed to an alliance with the SLFP and the President,” he said.
He said however if the right conditions are right, which can be agreed by all stakeholders, an alliance can be formed between President Maithripala Sirisena and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
He said the best way to overcome the political imbroglio in the country is to hold a Parliamentary election and let the people choose a stable government.
