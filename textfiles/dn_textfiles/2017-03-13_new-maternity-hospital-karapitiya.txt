New maternity hospital for Karapitiya

The new maternity hospital at Karapitiya being constructed under a loan of Rs 18 billion and grant of Rs 500 million with German finance assistance, will be completed within two years. It will be one of the most modern maternity hospitals in Sri Lanka, Petroleum Resources Development Minister Chandima Weerakkody told the Daily News.
The minister said the new maternity hospital is a prime need for the Southern Province because after the tsunami, the maternity hospital at Mahamodara, Galle, was badly damaged. It was later renovated for temporary use. The aim of the new hospital is to provide better healthcare for underprivileged patients. "The government wants to ensure that there won’t be pregnant mothers sleeping on the corridors of hospitals,” the minister said.
Health Ministry Deputy Project Director and Chief Civil Engineer Gayan Ranaweera said the new maternity hospital at Karapitiya, Galle, will consist of 600 beds for indoor patients along with clinical facilities to treat 200 outdoor patients daily.
In addition, it will also consist of an Intensive Care Unit, Premature Baby Care Unit, six Modular Theatres, Radiology Unit, Hematology Unit, Blood Bank, and Physiotherapy unit.
He said since Mahamodara Maternity Hospital is situated close to the sea, sensitive medical equipment such as scanners, X-ray machines, theatre apparatus, and the central AC become corroded due to the sea breeze.
The ministry had previously decided to relocate Mahamodara Maternity Hospital away from the sea belt to an interior location. However, this was not implemented due to the lack of funds. Now, it has been materialized, he said.
