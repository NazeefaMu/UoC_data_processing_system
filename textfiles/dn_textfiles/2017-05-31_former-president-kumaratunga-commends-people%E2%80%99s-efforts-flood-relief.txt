Former President Kumaratunga commends people’s efforts in flood relief

Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga said it was noteworthy that the people have shown great sacrifice and commitment by coming together in the time of calamity regardless of ethnic differences to help each other out.
“I would like to express my appreciation and respect to all those who have come forward to work with the government to serve all communities regardless of ethnicity and religion to saving lives, to provide food, clothing and other necessities to those affected,” said Kumaratunga in a statement released to the media yesterday.
As the Chairman of the Office of National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR), Kumaratunga also extended her gratitude towards the rescue work undertaken by the tri-forces and police.
She further called on all citizens to ensure such disasters do not recur and to support the President and the government machinery in ensuring that illegal constructions will not be built along waterways, not to fell our forests which lead to landslides and to support the programme of environmental conservation.
