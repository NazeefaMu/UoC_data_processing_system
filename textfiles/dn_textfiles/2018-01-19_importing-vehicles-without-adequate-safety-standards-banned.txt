Importing vehicles without adequate safety standards, banned

 
The Finance Ministry announced today that importing vehicles without seat belts, air bags and other safety mechanisms which do not comply with emission standard Euro IV or other equivalent would be banned from July 1.
Accordingly, it will be mandatory for vehicles imported after July 1 to contain air bags for the driving seat and the passenger seat, anti-locking breaking systems and three point seat belts.
Furthermore the Finance Ministry said that these implements which were approved in the 2018 budget were due to come into effect on January 1 but due to requests made by vehicle manufacturers and importers, the effective date was postponed to July 1.
Further details on the implementation of the new standards for vehicles, including the types of vehicles will be notified by the respective agencies in future, the Finance Ministry said.
