Parliment adjourned for ten minutes

 
The Parliament was adjourned for ten minutes due to a tense situation that arose with regard to the circulation of two booklets of the budget proposals.
The situation occurred when several opposition MPs raised questions on the circulation of two versions of the budget proposals. The MPs of the opposition questioned as to which version contained the correct budget proposals.
