Market suppliers cry foul at first Ministerial meeting

Retail market supplier collective in Sri Lanka voiced that the prohibited market practice of mixing imported and domestically milled rice could be overcome with a simple move, instead of resorting to punitive official raids.
Meeting the Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen on Thursday the Colombo Traders Association (CTA) said that maximum retail prices, imposed by the government have become an impediment, hampering Lankan consumer well-being, rather than improving it.The meeting was also attended by Minister’s top officials in charge of retail (across such institutions as the Consumer Affairs Authority, the CWE and Lanka Sathosa).
Here the delegation proposed equal prices for both imported and domestically milled rice in the local market.
“This can be done by a simple move -by increasing the duty on imported rice by as little as Rs 10 and no more. Raids are needed to prevent abuse but the present system of raiding is harsh and they show no mercy,” they opined.
The June 1 meeting, was attended by the CTA 90% of its 210 members are large volume importers and distributors and committed tax payers. The top CTA reps at June 1 meet were Chairman of CTA YM Ibrahim, Chairman, Ishana Exports Pvt Ltd-a leading exporter of spice), CTA Deputy Chairman SM Zaneer, Chairman, KTC Group-the main importer of dates, raisins & sultanas for Lankan market and also a leading rice miller, and CTA Secretary Sooriyar, Chairman of Sooriyan Traders-large scale importer of essential food items to Sri Lanka.
