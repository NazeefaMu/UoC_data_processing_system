Murunga : Unmatched Nutrition


Murunga (Moringa Oleifera) has a reputation of legendary proportions for being a vegetable high in nutrition and many health benefits. Garden Talk talks to Deputy Provincial Director of Agriculture Ratmalana, District Agricultural Instructor K.N.K Jayathilake on this plant also known as the ‘Drumstick tree’ that Sri Lankans have placed their trust in.
“To lead a healthy life and maintain our mental and physical health you need clean oxygen, clean water and nutrients. We can get these important nutrients by consuming healthy foods. We need to consume vegetables that are high in nutrition. We like to consume foods that are healthy and also delicious. However we must choose intelligently and Murunga is an intelligent choice,” said Jayathilake.
Murunga is one of those vegetables that can provide our body with proper nutrients.
“The Murunga pods and leaves are high in nutrition. It has many benefits. It is free of chemical agents which makes it good for human consumption. You can easily grow this vegetable in your home garden and it is a local product. It is ideally grown in the Dry Zone, where the temperature is high,” stated Jayathilake
It is a perennial plant growing up to four to five meters.
“It can be grown in the Wet Zone, but because of the low temperature you don’t have a good harvest or get many pods. Even though this is a Dry Zone plant, growing in a home garden in the Wet Zone is not a problem. This is because it is for daily consumption and not on a commercial scale. Also wherever you grow it, you can still use the leaves which are packed in nutrients. Through the leaves we can satisfy our daily nutritional needs,” pointed out Jayathilake
Varieties
In the Dry Zone the rainfall is less and the temperature is high. The climatic conditions are suitable for growing Murunga. Growing in the Wet Zone does not yield such a good harvest that you can get in the Dry Zone. “Consuming Murunga leaves is practical, recommended and an intelligent decision. In Sri Lanka we have identified two varieties of Murunga. They are Jaffna and Chavakachcheri types. The Jaffna variety is 60 – 90cm while the Chavakachcheri is three to four feet. It is spread out in India, Pakistan, Bhutan and Sri Lanka,” added Jayathilake Murunga is propagated by cuttings and are grown in polythene bags to draw out the roots. The soil medium in these polythene bags is made up of top soil, compost and sand. When the roots come out, we plant the Murunga plant in the field. When leaves appear, then we know that the roots have developed. When the plant grows up to one meter we cut off the Apical bud. “The Secondary shoots then appear and spread out to the sides. When this happens you are able to better maintain the plant and easily pick the pods and leaves since the tree has not grown too big. We cut off the Apical bud because if the tree grows too high, plucking pods and leaves will be difficult. These secondary shoots spread out like a bush and can be pruned. The Murunga has medicinal value and can also be used as a soup or curry. There is no such insect attack when it comes to this plant. No insecticides and Pesticides are needed, so there is food security,” explained Jayathilake.
Health benefits
Moringa Oleifera (Murunga) is considered legendary when it comes to health benefits and studies are already being conducted into the potential of this vegetable. The internet is abuzz with news about its powerful medicinal possibilities. One thing we know for sure is that it is rich in healthy antioxidants. It is reputed to help reduce high blood sugar levels. However more studies must be done for confirmation concerning reduction of blood sugar levels.
