Avurudu spirit at Tourist Information Centre

Sri Lanka Tourism made the Avurudu spirit come alive by showcasing the traditions of Sri Lanka and its people, and celebrating the Sinhala and Tamil New Year onApril 7, at the Tourist Information office premises, Colombo.
The event was organized by the Tourist Information Centre - Colombo. The New Year celebration was open to everyone including both local and foreign visitors. The New Year table was adorned with traditional avurudu sweetmeats, giving a glimpse of the Sri Lankan culture and its delectable delicacies.
The New Year table brimming with new year delicacies of all sorts was created under a hut with a thatched roof, as it gave a view of the traditional ‘’ ‘’village atmosphere’’ inside the TIC Centre in the heart of Colombo.
The TIC Centre was patronized by many tourists and all were impressed with the vivid diversity of the Sri Lankan culture and also cuisine.
The main purpose of celebrating this occasion was to showcase the culture and tradition of the people in Sri Lanka, and also their respect for traditional values, as the Sinhala – Hindu New year is the only occasion of the Sri Lankan calendar, where an entire nation gets together at an auspicious time and celebrates this important cultural event which has been descending from generation to generation.
It is not only a celebration, but also an ideal time for sharing and uniting, and also circulate positive thoughts and hopes for the new year.
