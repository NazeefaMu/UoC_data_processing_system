Sri Lankan all-rounder gets a new deal in T20 Blast

The T20 Blast is England is considered as one of the most popular T20 leagues across the cricketing world.
The 2018 edition of the tournament is expected to live up to all the hype and buzz that it has managed to generate thus far.

In a recent update, veteran Sri Lankan all-rounder Thisara Perera has bagged a deal in the competition.
Thisara Perera, who is a globe trotter in the world of T20 cricket, had a stint with the Gloucestershire side in the previous County season.
This season, he has again been signed by the Gloucs for a couple of matches in the T20 Blast.
Thisara Perera will be playing as a cover for Australian all-rounder Andrew Tye. Tye will miss out on some part of the competition owing to his national duties.
He is currently in Zimbabwe with the Australian side.
The Chief Executive of the Gloucestershire side is happy to have Thisara on-board in the meantime as an ideal cover.
“Having a player of Thisara’s quality join the club is a huge coup for Gloucestershire,” Chief executive Will Brown quoted as per the quotes in BBC.
AUSSIE VETERAN RETAINS HIS PLACE TOO
Meanwhile, veteran Australian cricketer Michael Klinger is set to feature for the Gloucs yet again this year.
Klinger had taken a break from cricket towards the end of 2017 after his wife, Cindy, was diagnosed with cancer.
Recently, speaking to the BBC Radio Bristol, Klinger gave an update on the health condition of his wife and remarked that she is recovering very well.
“She’s doing really well. She’s had a tough five or six months going through chemotherapy and needs some ongoing treatment going forward, but she’s improved a lot from where she was six months ago,” Michael Klinger remarked.
“We got some really positive results six weeks ago and, once we got that, we made the decision for me to come over here and play, because that was in doubt up until then,” the 38 year old veteran cricketer added further.
