Facets of tabla playing

Among the latest global trends related to music, the study of positive benefits related to learning music and engaging in music-related activities, are in the forefront. Various research studies conducted in such subject areas as social sciences, early childhood development and neurology has shown that music actively assists in the cognitive development of children.
The medium of expression in music is either singing or else playing an instrument. In the playing of instruments, such instruments used help in the process of expression. The teaching process in learning to play the tabla from long ago is the guru-shishyaparampara (teacher-student relationship) from generation to generation, also called the study method based on gurukula. The main concepts of that are skills, knowledge and application. According to this method, the student will study under the teacher for a long period, while the teacher will systematically teach the technical know-how of playing instruments. In this specialized teaching method which is part of the North-Indian musical tradition, the student is able to improve their knowledge, skills, personality, and discipline.
Solitary practice
There are several stages in the learning of tabla playing. They are the practising of tabla in front of the teacher, the solitary practice, and then practising as a group. In the beginning, one acquires knowledge by stationing oneself in front of the teacher. This system that existed in the ancient guru-shishyaparampara education system, can also be seen in the modern classroom. Here, the student who sits in front of the teacher and starts playing the instrument commences the learning process from the moment they place their hands on the tabla, as per the teacher’s instructions.
The special factor in tabla playing is that the student needs to grasp the teacher’s stance of playing well, in order to follow it and learn. The student has to pay good attention to the teacher’s physical movements, in order to do this. The activities that are carried out at this time will help develop communication skills, listening skills, agreement, mutual understanding, and understanding body language. A student learning to play the tabla only engages in the practice under a teacher for a short time. He will have to devote a lot of time to gain proficiency in the subject, practising at home.
He will have to test the knowledge he gained under the teacher and practically apply his skills at this stage. Writing down a score in a book and playing with that as guidance or listening to a recording of it and trying to match that playing, is not a system that was followed in the guru-shishyaparampara education system of ancient India. Studying a piece under the teacher and memorizing it and practising later, once you are not in front of the teacher, is a very successful method of study. One important factor in this is that the memorized piece of music has many special qualities within.
The composition contained syllables, speed, rhythmic pattern ( the number of syllables in each beat) and other such particular characteristics of each beat need to be remembered well. Apart from practising under the teacher in the classroom setting, when one practices in one’s home, one should remind oneself of the steps and practice the beat. This activity also develops one’s memory and the patience to engage in study.
