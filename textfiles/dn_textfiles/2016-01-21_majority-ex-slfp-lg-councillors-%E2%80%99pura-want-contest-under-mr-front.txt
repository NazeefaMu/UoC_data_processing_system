Majority of ex SLFP LG councillors in A’pura want to contest under MR front

More than 100 out of the total 137 former peoples representatives belonging to the SLFP in the Anuradhapura district met in Anuradhapura yesterday and unanimously decided to contest the forthcoming Local Government election from a new political front led by former President and Kuruengala District MP Mahinda Rajapaksa. Among them were SLFP members of now the defunct 18 local councils and SLFP members in the Anuradhaprua Municipal Council. The participants at this meeting presided over by Anuradhapura Mayor H. P. Somadasa also said that they would not accept the present SLFP leadership ,fielding questions from the media. Anuradhapura Mayor Somadasa said the name or the symbol of the new political front did not matter but they would all join hands to contest under the new political front and its symbol.
He said that SLFP and the UNP did not contest the recently held election under their registered party.
He alleged that President Maithripala Sirisena acted according to the whims and fancies of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesighe. He said the present SLFP General Secretary was also unacceptable to them. Former member of the Talawa Pradeshiya Sabha Abeyratne Herath said the present SLFP General Secretary who was from his Kalawewa electorate was groping in the dark and he had failed to set up a single SLFP branch or Bala Mandalaya in the electorate with genuine SLFP members.
Meanwhile Former chairmen of the Talawa, Nochchiyagama and Horowpothana Pradehsiya Sabhas were conspicuous by their absence at this meeting. Former Chairman of the Nochchiyagama Pradesheeya Sabha Nalin Dissanayake when contacted said he and several other former SLFP local government representatives would never leave the SLFP. He said they were not informed about yesterdays meeting. Neither would they attend such type of meetings without the party’s official approval.
They would never join these types of conspiracies hatched to promote the lot of Wimal Weerawansa and Udaya Gammanpila groups.
