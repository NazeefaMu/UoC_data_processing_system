To be or Knot  to be to the fore

The Sri Theatre is back on stage with an all-new play for Theatre lovers in Sri Lanka. It has been awhile since their last production Anarchy a play that we toured to Galle for the first time last year. This year they have packaged a rib-tickling comedy about a young girl forced into marriage with a boy she barely knows. Rukaiya is ambitious and smart however she fears that marriage might dampen her spirits.
But what to do?
The couple must get to know each other or they are to head for a divorce in no time. They must way love over the trust, destiny over free will, the new world over the old.
The play revolves around a Muslim family. This is one of the first times in Sri Lankan theatre that non-Muslims have the opportunity to enjoy the inconsistencies and jolly traditions observed by Muslims. The writer who likes to call himself an Existentialist Muslim believes that it is God’s given right to man that he questions his environment. “If God wanted blind followers he would simply have engineered automatic solar-powered robots, but then he didn’t.” a line from the play.
The first step to any form of reconciliation is to be able to laugh at ourselves believes Aslam the writer of To Be or Knot to be.
The cast for this play will include Sri Theatre company regulars Ruwanthi as Zeena, Anaz as Feroze, Siddath as Nazeer and Rochana as Rukaiya.
Sri theatre company believes that this play will change the way people think about another’s religion and realize that in Sri Lanka all religions adhere to a uniquely Lankan set of taboos and traditions.
The play will be staged at the Trinity College Hall on April 27 and 28 at 7.30 pm.
