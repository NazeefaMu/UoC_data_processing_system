Ministers' statements on Avant-Garde issue: President, PM to take decision

 
Cabinet spokesman and Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said a special Cabinet meeting will be held on October 9 morning to discuss the controversial Avant-Garde issue.
Dr. Senaratne addressing the weekly Cabinet press briefing in Colombo yesterday, said President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will take a decision on the statements made by two ministers on the Avant-Garde issue recently.
Minister Senaratne said the statements were made without Cabinet approval and stern action should be taken against making such statements.
"Although they said there were no grounds for taking legal action against Avant-Garde, that is not the official position of the government," he said.
The government's official position on Avant-Garde has still not been revealed. The issue will be discussed at the special meeting, the minister said.
He said the ministers' statements were not an opinion of the political parties and civil organisations which helped bring the Yahapalana government to power.
Senaratne said he had the Attorney General's file on the Avant-Garde case with him.
The Attorney General's report has clearly mentioned the possibility of taking certain people into the custody over this matter. The names have also been clearly mentioned. But, there has been a substantial delay in taking action against Avant-Garde perpetrators, the minister said.
"According to Attorney General's Department officials, a particular minister made several threatening phone calls to the Attorney General's Department not to arrest the persons named in the Attorney General's report. After President Maithripala Sirisena came to power, I queried about this case when the National Executive Council held its first meeting. The AG Department's officials said that arrangements have been taken to arrest several people connection with this case the following week. This never happened," he said.
"All of a sudden it was converted to a civil case from a criminal case. According to Attorney General's Department sources, one minister in particular has exerted immense pressure on the Department to go slow on this case," Dr. Senaratne said.
He said the two ministers were appointed by the National Executive Council on the Avant-Garde matter.
"One of the two ministers provided legal assistance to the Avant-Grade owner. The Prime Minister clearly instructed him not to interfere with or give instructions to the Police with regard to the Avant-Garde investigation. I have no personal enmity against Nishshanka Senadhipathi. But, we must always keep in our minds why we have established the Yahapalana government," the minister said.
"Even the President's name has been dragged into this incident. Some media reports published that Avant-Grade Charmain Nishshanka Senadhipathi had congratulated the President after the January 8 victory. However, the President denied this. He said he had no recollection of such an encounter among the large number of people who came to wish him after the election victory. We established the Yahapalana government, but it seems that there are no cases against those who have money and the cases are actually against those who worked to establish Yahapalana," he said.
"Pilleyan was arrested over the discovery of six weapons but no action has been taken against Avant Garde even with the discovery of over 3,000 weapons," the minister said.
Dr. Senaratne recalled that when he was with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, various MPs from the UNP called the former President and disclosed what was happening at UNP Committee meetings.
"There were so many UNPers who were on the pay role of the former President. Some of these people are now sitting with us in the present Cabinet," he said.
