Govt. will solve Tamil people's problems before 2018 May Day – Health Minister

Addressing the Democratic National Movement's May Day Rally held in Jaffna on May 1, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said the Government would take steps to solve the problems of the Tamil people before celebrating next May Day 2018. He said the people from North and and the South who were killed during the war belonged to the oppressed class. I always have demanded the Cabinet to solve the problems of the Tamil people, he said.
According to Minister Dr. Senaratne, he rejected racism, casts differences and religious differences. He only respected humanity.
He said that he had done his best to solve the ethnic conflict through discussions and travelled to the North on several occasions in the past, even when the war was in progress. He always wanted to share power and his struggle turned successful on January 8, 2015.
The children from the South and the North should be provided with employment. Although the Government had promised to solve problems concerning the Northern people, it has been very slow.
The process should be accelerated. Missing children should be found, lands should be returned to its rightful owners and political prisoners should be freed, he added. The Leader of the Movement Sudharshi Vijayakanth and many others addressed the event. Dr. Kapila Ranasinghe, SPC Managing Director Dr. Rumi Mohammad and many others were present on the occasion.
