President Sirisena pledges to develop Polonnaruwa District

 
President Maithripala Sirisena pledged to develop the Polonnaruwa district which was a duty the former regime failed to fulfil under their capabilities.
He said this while addressing a ceremony held yesterday to inaugurate the Polysac Factory built in Sinhapura, Welikanda, Polonnaruwa.
President Sirisena expressed his satisfaction over the opportunities created by the new establishment to strengthen the livelihoods of the farming community in Polonnaruwa.
The inaugurated factory, New Rathna Pvt. Ltd packages rice. This establishment creates 350 direct jobs and 500 indirect jobs for the youth in Polonnaruwa District.
He said that more factories like these which strengthen the national economy and support the livelihood of people should be established in other fields too.
‘The government will encourage these establishments and provide required facilities to them’, the President said.
President Sirisena said that the government will take measures to stop importing poly-sac productions to encourage and strengthen local manufacturers.
The President also observed the mango plantation project, affiliated to Rathna Polysac Company and observed the rice processing centre too.
