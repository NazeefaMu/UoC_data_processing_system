Coconuts for Rs. 65

The Coconut Cultivation Board (CCB) and Lanka Sathosa have jointly taken measures to provide coconuts at Rs 65. Accordingly, the consumers will be able to purchase five coconuts at Rs.65 each at Sathosa outlets.
Coconut Cultivation Board (CCB) Chairman Kapila Yakandawala said the CCB has already issued one million coconuts to the market. Measures would be taken to supply four million coconuts to the market by next month. 
Then we would be able to completely normalize the price of coconuts.
Around 70,000 coconuts have been supplied to 180 urban Sathosa outlets and we also informed “Kapruka” societies to supply coconuts directly to Sathosa outlets. He said the programme to provide coconuts to the public at a concessionary price was launched by the CCB with the intention of controlling unusual price hike.
As a result of this we would be able to control the unnecessary profits earned by traders.
