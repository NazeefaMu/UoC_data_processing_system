Cattle thieving menace in Panadura, police inactive

Cattle thieves had forcibly entered the Gangathilakarama Viharaya at Kehelwatte Panadura and had stolen four heads of cattle earlier this month.
The temple’s chief incumbent Ven. Siyambalagoda Jinarathana thera had complained to the Panadura North Police that this theft was recorded on cameras installed in a house in front of the temple. Panadura Cattle farmers Association President Nandani Malkanthi said over 250 heads of cattle valued at over a million rupees had been stolen from cattle breeders in the Panadura Police Division.
She said police had failed to arrest thieves roaming in the night and they were well organised in rounding up cattle in mini lorries.
She had complained to the Panadura Division SSP last year as well but no action had been taken.
She intends organising a picketing campaign against the police for their inaction.
She said there is an abattoir at Atalugama and the cattle thieves and the owner of the illicit slaughter house work in tandem. She called for police to engage in night patrols to apprehend these cattle thieves.
