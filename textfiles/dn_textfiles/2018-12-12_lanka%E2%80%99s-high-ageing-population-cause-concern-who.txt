Lanka’s high ageing population, a cause for concern - WHO

WHO Representative Dr. Olivia Nieveras said the WHO selected Sri Lanka to hold the World Health Day this year in recognition of the significant health achievements in Sri Lanka.
The social investments such as female education in Sri Lanka has helped the country to achieve good health outcome, she said.
Sri Lanka has achieved a good progress in controlling Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs), mother and child care, but need to be focused on rapidly aging population. Sri Lanka has one of the fasted aging populations in the world, she added.
A total of 20.8 percent of the Sri Lankan population will be over 60 by 2031, National Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol (NATA) Chairman Dr. Palitha Abeykoon said.
Addressing a press conference held at the Sri Lanka Medical Association (SLMA) Auditorium in Colombo yesterday he said that by 2031, the percentage of below 20 population in Sri Lanka will be 25.8 percent. Around 90 percent of health expenses occur in human life during the last two to five years. At the moment Sri Lankan people spend around 40 to 45 percent of their health expenses out of pocket.
According to Dr. Abeykoon, the out of pocket health expenses of a country should be reduced below 25 percent. Only Thailand and Bhutan in the region has achieved this target and the out of pocket expenses for health in those two countries are around 25 percent. Health coverage should reach the poorest and the most vulnerable population. Full range of essential services should be made available to the people.
