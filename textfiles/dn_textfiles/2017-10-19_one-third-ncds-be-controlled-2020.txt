One third of NCDs to be controlled by 2020

 Steps have been taken to control one third of the Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs) in Sri Lanka by 2020, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne had stated.
According to Minister Senaratne, the initial step to control the use of tobacco has been taken by President Maithripala Sirisena without considering the income generated through tobacco.
“His main objective was saving lives. That is how I was able to increase the tax on tobacco to 90 percent,” the minister stated, addressing the World Health Summit held in Berlin, Germany from October 15 to 17.
Minister Senaratne had also stated that 60 percent of Sri Lankan patients who are admitted to hospitals die due to NCDs.
After coming to power in January 2015, the government has increased the tax on tobacco to 90 percent and implemented 80 percent of pictorial warning on cigarette packets.
The sale of cigarettes has gone down now, he said.
In the near future, the government will ban the sale of single cigarettes and also ban selling cigarettes around a radius of 500 metres from schools.
The sale of sweetened drinks has gone down after the introduction of the traffic light system and companies have reduced the amount of sugar added to their sweetened drinks, the minister had stated.
Dr. Sujatha Senaratne, Sri Lankan Ambassador to Germany Karunasena Hettiarachchi and others were a part of the Sri Lankan delegation.
The session was chaired by Princess Dina Mirad of Jordan and Financial Times Editor Andrew Jack.
