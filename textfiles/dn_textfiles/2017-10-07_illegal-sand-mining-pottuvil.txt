Illegal sand mining in Pottuvil

Mass-scale illegal sand mining is being carried out in the Karanthoya River bordering the Thangapillai private paddy land area in the Pottuvil division in the Ampara district.
It has caused immense danger to several locations along the Thangapillai area, villagers complain.
The public alleges that several tractors laden with sand mined in the area cross the Karanthoya River daily, damaging the ecosystem. Private paddy lands are also damaged.
People urge authorities to provide a quick solution to this illegal sand mining racket.
