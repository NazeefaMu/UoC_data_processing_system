Landslide threat in Pothgulkande; twenty families evacuated

Twenty families resident in Pothgulkande, Ratnapura, were evacuated to a safer location due to a landslide threat on May 29 night, Director National Building Research Organisation R.M.S. Bandara said.
Since a 100-metre incline in the hill had loosened, the area had been declared a danger zone, he added.
