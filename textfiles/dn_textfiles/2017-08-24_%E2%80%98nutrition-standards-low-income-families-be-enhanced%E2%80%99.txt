‘Nutrition standards of low-income families to be enhanced’

The nutrition standard of children in low-income families in the Matara District is to be enhanced, Samadhi Community Development Foundation Chairman and the Matara District Parliamentarian Buddhika Pathirana said.
These programmes are successfully in progress at the Divisional Secretariat Division level in the Matara district, he added. A survey carried out in the district by the Foundation had revealed that over 26,000 families with underweight children are in the Matara District at present and another 5,000 school-going children are also suffering from poor eye vision.
The poverty alone had not been the reason for this sad situation. Various health problems have also affected these poor health conditions, he said. Measures have been taken to identify 20 low-income families with underweight children from each Grama Niladari area in the district and also to provide them with nutrition packets worth over Rs. 7,500.
In addition, tins of nutritive milk power, each worth over Rs. 10,000 are also to be distributed among underweight children between six months to four years of age, under the Samadhi Kekulu Suwasetha Project affiliated to the Matara Samadhi Community Development Foundation.
The Foundation will check the weight of these children prior to handing over food items.
The progress they have made after giving these nutriments will also be monitored in a few months. These welfare programmes are underway in the Divisional Secretariat Divisions of Thihagoda, Kirinda Puhulwella, Hakmana, Kamburupitiya, Akuressa, Athuraliya, Devinuwara, Weligama and Matara. They will also be extended to other Divisional Secretariat Divisions as well.
Funds of local and international donor organizations are utilized in this regard, MP Pathirana added.
