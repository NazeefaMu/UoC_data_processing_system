Engine disengages inconveniencing train passengers in Padukka

Office workers travelling to work in the Kelani valley train, which left Padukka at 7.05 am yesterday, were inconvenienced as the train engine had disengaged from the compartments near the level crossing opposite the Padukka hospital due to the disruption of pressure tubes.
However, the engine driver had managed to drive the train up to the Padukka railway station by temporarily connecting the pressure tubes and had sent the passengers to Colombo in another train.
There was a massive traffic jam on the 125 bus route yesterday morning due to this mishap.
