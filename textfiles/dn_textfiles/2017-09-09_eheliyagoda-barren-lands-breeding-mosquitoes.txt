Eheliyagoda barren lands breeding mosquitoes

Although over 90 percent of the villagers in Eheliyagoda try to keep their home gardens free of mosquito breeding sites, barren lands as well as some rubber estates have become breeding grounds for mosquitoes, Eheliyagoda PHI Tharanga Jinasena said.
He said so at the Eheliyagoda Coordination Committee Meeting held recently at the Eheliyagoda Divisional Secretariat auditorium.
The meeting was headed by Presidential Special Project Director Sarath Sandanaike and Eheliyagoda UNP Chief Orhanisor Siripala Kiriella.
PHI Jinasena said large and dried Del and Para leaves have turned into mosquito breeding sites during rainy days.
In addition, he pointed out that some schoolchildren are in the habit of throwing empty food packets and polythene wrappers carelessly in the school premises.
Also, those who dispose garbage into drainages help breed mosquitoes, he said.
He added that nearly 900 dengue patients were reported from the Eheliyagoda MOH area and six deaths were reported so far. Steps are being taken to educate citizens with regard to methods to prevent mosquitoes.
