Abject state of SPC councillors hostel, disgrace to members’ dignity

Southern Provincial Councillors who occupy the council’s hostel complex at Labuduwa, Galle have to undergo immense hardships due to numerous shortcomings. Especially sanitary facilities and water supply to toilets are substandard and unsatisfactory. Due to the inferior and unhygienic situation of the hostel premises, the councillors go through innumerable inconveniences and the pitiful situation of hostels is a humiliation to the dignity of the councillors, chief whip of the ruling coalition Councillor Ajith Rajapaksa alleged.
He made the allegation at the council meeting held yesterday at the Council secretariat at Kalegama, Galle. Chairman Somawansa Kodagoda presided over the meeting.
The councillors from Matara and Hambantota districts come to Galle one day prior to council meetings and stay at the hostels to attend the meetings. The councillors who stay there suffer greatly owing to the various deficiencies prevailing at council hostels, the councillor further said.
Rajapaksa urged urgent attention of the authorities and swift action taken to rectify the complications of the hostel complex. Opposition Leader Tennakoon Nilame also supported the allegations levelled by councillor Rajapaksa.
In response to the councillors’ charges Chairman Somawanasa Kodagoda said a suitable land for the construction of a new hostel complex for the councillors had been acquired and necessary building plans had been prepared and duly sanctioned by the Southern Province Engineering Services Department. “Now all measures have been taken for the construction of a new hostel complex for councillors. At present we are waiting to receive the necessary funds. As soon as we get the funds, the work on the proposed project would commence,” the Chairman assured.
