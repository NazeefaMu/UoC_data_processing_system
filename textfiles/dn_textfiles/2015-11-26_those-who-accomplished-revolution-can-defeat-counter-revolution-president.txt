Those who accomplished revolution can defeat counter-revolution - President

Persons who accomplished the revolution can defeat the counter-revolution, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
"We should make an attempt on what we should do at present and for what we do for the future by not forgetting the memories of November Revolution," he added.
The President made these remarks at the launching ceremony of the book 'Great November Revolution', written by Dinesh Weerakkody.

He also pointed out that everybody should act with an understanding of the challenges and obstacles which will arise in the future.
"Politics is a complex, problematic and a challenging task. Those who are engaged in politics are not dead objects but are living human beings. Therefore, creating a government, continuing it and facing the future should be done thoughtfully," he said.
