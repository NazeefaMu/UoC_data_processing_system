‘A Flying Jatt’similar to ‘KRRISH’?

Tiger Shroff admires Hrithik Roshan. The young actor believes he has studied the star so much that it reflects in his performance at times.
In a candid chat with DNA, the ‘Baaghi’ star said that the poster of his next, ‘A Flying Jatt,’ gives off ‘Krrish’ like vibes. "I didn't do this on purpose, but if you notice the first look of 'A Flying Jatt' and an old poster of 'Krrish,' the body language looks a lot similar. I guess I have studied him so much that I feel like him sometimes," the daily quoted him as saying.
The posters of ‘A Flying Jatt’ and ‘Krrish’ may appear similar, but the story is way different.
"I admire him so I think about him like that — maybe think about how he would have stood, how he would have danced or said something in a particular scene," he elaborated.
However, Tiger doesn't play the crime-fighting, people-saving caped crusader in ‘A Flying Jatt.’ He gets to fall in love with Jacqueline Fernandez and even break a leg with her. Directed by Remo D'Souza, the film is scheduled to arrive in theatres on August 25. IBT
