[APPRECIATIONS - (09-07-2018)]

Rev. Canon Raylin Andradie
Servant of the Lord
During his 64th death anniversary, Rev. Don Raylin Henry Andradie, a distinguished son of Moratuwa, will be remembered as one who gave himself completely to the service of his church as an indefatigable servant of the Lord, a faithful priest and a committed pastor.
His regular visits to his parishioners as well as his impeccable memory and winsome ways, stood out as hallmarks of his ministry. Rev. Andradie, his full name being Don Raylin Henry Jacob Andradie Warnakula Jayasuriya, prefixed by Arasakulasuriya Arasanailayaitta Adiya, was born in his ancestral home called Andradie Niwasa at Lady Evelyn de Soysa Road in Idama, Moratuwa.
He was baptised and confirmed at the Church of Holy Emmanuel, Moratuwa. At Prince of Wales College, Moratuwa, he acquainted himself well with studies and was successful in both the Cambridge Senior and Matriculation Examinations.
He was ordained a deacon in 1924, after having successfully completed a course in theological studies at the Divinity School in Colombo and a priest in 1925. In May 1927, he married Balapuraduge Letitia Charlotte Mendis, a teacher attached to Prince of Wales College, Moratuwa. She was at the time, residing at Mount Pleasant in Moratumulla, Moratuwa. The marriage was solemnised at the Church of Holy Emmanuel, Moratuwa. They were later blessed with two children: Christopher and Pauline.
A doughty champion of the Anglo-Catholic cause, he steadfastly held to its traditions wherever he served. His 30-year long ministry extended from Matara through Panadura, Egoda Uyana, Koralawella, Horethuduwa, Dandugama and Kurana, along the West coast and from Badulla through Kandy to Kurunegala, in the hill country.
As an erudite scholar proficient in many a language; Sinhala, English, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Pali and Sanskrit; his bountiful knowledge was made use of not only as a lecture in Sinhala in the Divinity School in Colombo, but also as a translator of the Holy Scriptures and the Book of Common Prayer into Sinhala.
Bishop Archibald Rollo Graham Campbell, the eighth Bishop of Colombo, in a tribute to the late Rev. Andradie made at the Diocesan Council Sessions of 1945, said, “During the 30 years of his ministry, he laboured faithfully to fulfil the responsibilities of that ministry, while caring for the people committed to his charge. All the time, he laboured to make the Bible and other prayer books available all communities, in their own tongue.”
Rev. S. W. Douglas de Mel, in an appreciation published in the Ceylon Churchman during September in 1954, said, “The reward for all his efforts is seen perhaps in the progress made by Tamil students in a language quite foreign to them and the desire he kindled in the hearts of Sinhala students to love and learn their mother tongue better.”
While Rev. Andradie was in service at St. Paul’s Church in Kandy during 1932, he had the rare privilege of meeting the Duke of Gloucester when he arrived in Ceylon for the enthronement of the last King of Kandy.
Among his publications are The St. Peter’s Prayer Book (1939) and Sith Uyana (1946), which are widely used even today in most Anglican homes, especially in Moratuwa. Children’s Prayers (1947) is one of his lesser-known works. He was the editor the Sinhala monthly journal Dharmadeepthiya.
In 1953, in recognition of his faithful service to God, Rev. Andradie was appointed a Canon of the Cathedral Church of Christ to the seat of St. Lawrence Church, by Bishop Archibald. During the latter years of his life, the Rev. suffered due to his failing health, but still travelled a distance of 20 kilometres each day to Dandugama, to teach students at the Divinity School in Colombo. At the time of his death, he had almost completed a commentary of St. Mathew’s Gospel in Sinhala.
Six years ago in 1954, Rev. Andradie was called to rest on June 22, in the presence of a large gathering. It was a glowing tribute to the piety and faithfulness of the much-loved priest. PP

Niroshan Srideva
A brave believer
Everything happens in consonance with divine will.
My son Niroshan who was a final-year medical student at the Sri Jayawardenepura University, met his untimely demise on July 6, 2001, on Guru Poornima Day. He sacrificed his life to save me, his father. If he wanted to, he could have escaped, but instead, rebelled against the assailant and fell prey to his blade.
Even though the incident took place 18 years ago, he is always remembered by his fellow Sai devotees. Unfortunately, the culprits are still at large. Brahma once addressed sage Narada and said, “I create the bad in order to highlight and promote the good.” I cannot comment on what is said in scriptures. Why were murderers created?
For the protection of the world, for upholding righteous action (dharma) and for fulfilling the yearnings of devotees, God willed a special physical human form as Sri Sathya Sai Baba. Niroshan became an ardent devotee of Swami from the age of 8.
Nirosh treasured the stories and leelas of Swami.
They filled him with love and devotion to God. In his room, he had a number of books on Swami’s teachings as well as Buddhism and Christianity.
He also possessed books on Saints such as Ramana Maharishi and Ramdas, which he would have read with joy. He had a sound knowledge on the atma, which enabled him to keep himself on an even keel, neither rising when praised nor falling when blamed, while never worrying about the past, present or future.
After he sustained stab injuries on that fateful day, he had a calm composure, with a smile on his face. Niroshan, my dearest son, I miss you immensely and anxiously await my liberation or mukthi, as I am now free from all familial obligations.

Manthri Kariyawasam
Eminent pioneer in education
The saddening news of the passing of Manthri Kariyawasam reached us from Melbourne, Australia, on Saturday morning. He was 85 years old when death overtook him.
To many in Sri Lanka, even to those in the professional or academic communications fields, the name Manthri Kariyawasam may not ring a bell. But the stark truth is that Manthri played a central and pioneering role in the introduction of Mass Communications Studies to the Tertiary Educational Level in the country.
Since history enabled me to perform the principal series of activities involved in this tertiary educational innovation, I am the most suitable person to assess and chronicle the significance of Manthri Kariyawasam’s service and contribution to this history-making educational movement.
Manthri and I were on the editorial staff of Lake House in the early 1960’s. He impressed me as a brash and daring young person. At that age, he had a peculiar fascination for sports cars. He would occasionally ask me to have a ride in his car. At the wheel, he was almost fiendish, but always safe. Although I had minor qualms, I knew that Manthri was fully aware of what he was doing.
Eventually, he left Lake House and took up a state assignment. In the course of his official duties, Manthri was put in charge of the Mass Communications Department of the newly-established Junior University.
One evening, he called me. He asked me, almost off hand, “Edwin, can you teach Mass Communications at the Junior University?” I, of course, said yes.
He proposed this because he was convinced that I could handle that academic responsibility. He knew how deeply I studied the latest developments in the fields of Media and Mass Communication.
He gave me a free hand. I created an extensive syllabus which included not only academic aspects, but the crucial practical facets of Mass Communication as well. I formulated assessment systems and on-the-job training. The research work for the final exam was part of the system.
Manthri assured me; “Edwin, you do all the academic work. I will be merely the mover and shaker.” I am grateful to him, that he enabled me to achieve an eminent place in the tertiary educational history of this land, by formulating the pioneering, comprehensive syllabus for this discipline. He remained my unswerving friend and the supreme patron of this new discipline.
Our students, Harold Pieris being the foremost among them (assessed objectively), testify to Manthri’s humane and easy-going ways with the students.
He remains ever fresh in my memory, as my ever kind friend who enabled me to achieve the historical status of the academic pioneer to introduce Mass Communication to Sri Lanka’s tertiary education.
Our condolences to the bereaved family. May Manthri attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana. Dr. Edwin Ariyadasa

Doreen Mural
An exemplary mother
It is with grief and gratitude that I pen these few lines on my only aunt Kurukulasooriya Doreen Mural (nee Perera). She passed away on June 21, 2017, at the age of 83.
My aunt (my father’s sister), was the youngest in a family of three. Her only brother late K. Joseph Mervyn Perera was a Time-keeping Clerk at the Colombo Port Commission (Now Sri Lanka Ports Authority). He was 56 at the time of his death in 1987.
She received her education at our Lady of Victories Convent at Moratuwa and was keen on her studies. However, she discontinued her studies when her father fell ill. Aunt Doreen was fluent in Sinhala, English and Tamil.
She later married Lawrence Mural from Negombo. They were happily married and uncle Lawrence loved his wife unconditionally. He served in the Department of Census and Statistics for 36 years and later, went into retirement in 1919. He passed away in 1992.
Aunt Doreen and uncle Lawrence were blessed with four sons. Their eldest son Rupert was a close friend of mine. Corlo was their secondborn, Rosemund was the third and Quintus was the fourth; he is currently in Italy.
Aunt Doreen was the pivot around which her family unit revolved around and family always came first. She symbolised the quintessential qualities of motherhood. Aunt Doreen was an exemplary mother whose devotion and concern for her children extended beyond their childhood years. Her unconditional love and understanding allowed her children to carve their own path in life and today, all of them are faring well. My aunt was a prayer-warrior, both beginning and ending each day with a prayer. She spent much time reading the Bible. She was a friend, mother and a spiritual guide to me; during difficult times, she was always there, praying with me and during good times, she was there, praising god with me.
We visited her and her family during every church feast (St. Sebastian’s Church, Moratuwa), but in 2015 and 2016, we failed to do so due to unavoidable circumstances. Aunt Doreen passed away peacefully and was laid to rest on June 24, 2017, at the Grand Street Church in Negombo.
Our deepest sympathies go to her sons, daughters-in-law and grandchildren. May her soul rest in peace.

Ahamed Lebbe
Ardent educationist
Your sudden demise
Just before you left for home
After a seminar In Colombo,
Shocked and grieved so many, so much.
Your illustrious service
In various education districts
As a zonal director,
Left a large gap.
We miss you immensely
You were an eminent educationist
The thesis you had been writing for your PhD,
Is now left half-done; incomplete.
Unfortunately, that’s the way of life
Allah has limited and extended our doings
Your decency, straightforward ways,
Strict discipline and especially,
Your pure hands in all what you did,
Were brightly reflected in the pouring in
Of several busloads of people
From various districts.
You served until your final breath
All your good deeds will surely
Safeguard you hereafter,
Insha Allah.
Those devoted to life, to education,
Never die; they are said to
And attain eternal bliss;
Everlasting peace.
Allah, you are most gracious and merciful
We pray you bless our dearest Ahamed
With Jennathul Firdowz.
Aameen
M. A. M. Ibrahim
