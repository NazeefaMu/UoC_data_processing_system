David Pieris Group trains women in auto repair

David Pieris Group of Companies has begun making inroads to change statistic with its ‘Empowering Women through Technical Training’ programme.
This initiative will provide technical training in the repair of two-wheelers and three-wheelers with the ultimate goal of creating trained, certified women mechanics.
It is the first of its kind in Sri Lanka, as it is the only mechanic based technical programme targeting women only.
Working with the DPMC island-wide dealer network, 50 women from different parts of the country were selected to undergo this three-month programme.
Once they completed three-day technical training, the participants will undergo practical work at DPMC service dealers in their respected areas in order to gain necessary and valuable hands- on experience.
Following a final assessment at company's Two-wheeler and Three-wheeler Assembly Plant in Ranna in the Hambantota District, they will be certified as mechanics, which will open for them a meaningful and lucrative career path. One of the participants, Maheshika Dilrukshi from Bulathsinhala said that this programme would help her to start her own business in the future.
Chandima Shrimali from Kegalle explained, “I have been working at a DPMC's Spare Parts Dealer Outlet for past 10 years and this programme is an opportunity for me to get sound technical knowledge.”
The inauguration ceremony of the ‘Empowering Women through Technical Training’ programme was held recently at David Pieris Group auditorium in Bandaragama.
The programme was organized by the Group's Social Welfare Committee. The General Manager of the David Pieris Motor Company Limited and Chairman of the Committee Jayantha Ratnayake, Deputy Director of Sri Lanka Women’s Bureau of the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs Kumari Kosgahakumbura and several other officers participated to the occasion.
As an automotive leader in Sri Lanka, David Pieris Group is committed in its responsibility toward the community and the goal of positively impacting on people’s lives.The Group believes that empowering women through training and skill development is critical for the development and sustainability of our economy and the Nation.
Most importantly, the Group hopes that these women are will be trailblazers for more women to take up roles which have traditionally been male dominated.
