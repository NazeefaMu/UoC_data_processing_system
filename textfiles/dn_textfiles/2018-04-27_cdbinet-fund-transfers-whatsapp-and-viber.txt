CDBiNet fund transfers with  WhatsApp and Viber

Citizens Development Business Finance PLC (CDB) has set up CDBiNet to enable fund transfers through the social media platforms, namely Facebook, WhatsApp and Viber as well as email and text messages (SMS).
CDBiNet already broken records by enabling fund transfers through Facebook not too long ago, which has now become a popular transaction mode among its customers given the conveniences of not requiring the bank details of the fund recipient when transferring funds, a company press release said.
These conveniences have now expanded to WhatsApp, Viber and many other popular social media platforms.
CDBiNet, the first of its kind e-finance platform in Sri Lanka, transformed the entire financial services industry when it was introduced in June last year.
Hosting an expansive range of facilities and services which includes the opening of savings accounts and fixed deposits to utility bill payments, application for VISA debit cards, fund transfers, information on leases and loans and online rental payments, CDBiNET is open to all CDB Savings Account Holders.
Furthermore, a CDB Savings Account can be opened by anyone using a smart phone, desktop, or laptop without the need to visit a branch—the most convenient method to open a savings account.
The revolutionary finance platform enables all these services with the simple click of a button or via a smartphone.
By adding the fund transfer facility now on Facebook, WhatsApp, Viber and many other social media platforms, CDB has stepped onto a pioneering technology innovation platform that brings with it a fundamental competitive edge to the entirety of the financial services industry.
With a penchant for pushing CDB’s pioneering psyche into innovative breakthroughs, MD and CEO of CDB Mahesh Nanayakkara believes that CDB’s ultimate vision to become a financial powerhouse is the overarching focus that drives his team to reach new heights.
Reiterating the benefits that will result from this unique fund transfer method, CDB’s General Manager – Emergent Business Information Technology Imdaad Naguib explains that any recipient can receive funds via any mobile device or laptop/desktop if they are on WhatsApp, Viber or Facebook.
