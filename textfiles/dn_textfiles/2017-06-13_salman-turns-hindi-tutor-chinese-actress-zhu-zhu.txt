Salman turns Hindi tutor for Chinese actress Zhu Zhu

Salman Khan had earlier admitted that he taught Hindi to his ex-girlfriend Katrina Kaif and his film Kick’s co-star Jacqueline Fernandez.
However, he had gone on record to say that teaching Jacqueline the language was much easier than Katrina.
Now, making her name in the superstar’s language student list is his upcoming film Tubelight’s Chinese actress Zhu Zhu. This film marks her debut in Bollywood. The actress underwent special Hindi class to learn her dialogues. She worked hard at her diction but since she only had very few days to learn, at times she would take longer to get the language right and director Kabir Khan is known to be a perfectionist.
It’s then that Salman turned to Zhu Zhu’s rescue. He would go over her lines before her scenes, explaining the meaning of her lines. He even came up with easy ways to help her remember these lines.
Tubelight is produced by Salma Khan and Salman Khan and directed by Kabir Khan. The film is all set for a worldwide release on Eid. Times of India
