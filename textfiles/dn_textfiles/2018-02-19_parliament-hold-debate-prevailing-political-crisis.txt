Parliament to hold debate on prevailing political crisis

 
Parliament will take up a special adjournment debate from 4 p.m. until 7 p.m. today on the prevailing political crisis. 
The decision was made at a special Party Leaders' meeting held to discuss the written request made to hold the debate by Joint Opposition Leader Dinesh Gunewardena, a short while ago.
The Speaker convened a Party Leaders meeting, suspending sittings for 15 minutes earlier today.
