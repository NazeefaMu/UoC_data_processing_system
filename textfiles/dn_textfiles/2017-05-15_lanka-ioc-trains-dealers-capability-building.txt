Lanka IOC trains dealers in capability building

Lanka IOC recently organized a Capability Building Workshop for its dealer network in association with the Management Studies and Commerce Faculty, Sri Jayewardenepura University.
The university's Entrepreneurship Department Head Rukmal Weerasinghe was involved in designing the course module. Seventy dealers participated in the workshop.
The workshop was inaugurated by Lanka IOC Managing Director Shyam Bohra. In his keynote address Bohra stressed the need for constant upgrading of knowledge through such interactions with top management institutes. He said that knowledge upgrading was equally important for the company's dealers as it was for its executives since dealers are the real face of the company. Such workshops will help in further improving the brand image of Lanka IOC and help maintain its service leadership position in the country.
