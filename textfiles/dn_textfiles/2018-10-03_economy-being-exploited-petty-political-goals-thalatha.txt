Economy being exploited for  petty political goals - Thalatha

Those who speak about depreciation of the Rupee at least did not reduce the fuel price on the orders of the Supreme Court, Justice and Prison Reforms Minister Thalatha Atukorala said.
She said they attempt to create a wrong image on the the economy to get petty political advantage.
The Minister was responding the queries by journalists following a ceremony at Belihuloya on Monday.
She said the politicians in the previous government could have dropped the cost of living of the people by reducing the fuel price as instructed by the Supreme Court.
“But they did otherwise,” Minister Atukorala said. “The corruption, waste and thefts committed during the previous regime aggravated the economy and we have taken measures to stop them. Those days some members used 30 to 40 vehicles,” she said.
The currency depreciation is common in the regional countries and the Rupee is far better than those currencies, she said. She said the currency in Russia too is depreciating and in India, Afganistan, Bangladesh and in others, the same thing happen. She said this is a result of the competition between leading nations which Sri Lanka has no control over.
Minister Atukorala said the government empowers the people who were neglected during the previous regime.
She said the government has taken measures to appreciate the Rupee. The vehicle permits granted to Parliamentarians and the Ministries were cancelled. She said Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera had taken many measures to appreciate the Rupee.
