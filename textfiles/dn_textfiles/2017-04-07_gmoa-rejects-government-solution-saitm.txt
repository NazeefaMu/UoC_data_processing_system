GMOA rejects government solution on SAITM

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) has rejected the solution offered by the government on the SAITM issue.
Speaking to the media this evening, GMOA Secretary Dr. Navin de Zoysa said they wanted the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) shut down, not taken over by the government.
He also promised that the GMOA would set up a branch within the newly nationalised Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital and continue their protest to have SAITM closed.
The government announced earlier today the Health Ministry would take over the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital.
MBBS graduates from SAITM would be given further clinical training at the Homagama and Avissawella Hospitals, whereafter they would undergo a mandatory examination under the joint supervision of the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) and the University Grants Commission (UGC) for provisional registration.
