Tiger eye hair trend sweeps over social media

The humble balayage - hand-painted subtle highlights - has got a new twist, and a new name. Say hello to tiger eye hair, the colour you need to get this season to add warmth and dimension to your hair.
Before we go ahead with it, let’s refresh our knowledge. Tiger eye is a semi-precious stone with a distinct pattern of rich bronze, gold and dark brown stripes.
Tiger eye hair means the same shade family on your strands, but instead of the clearly demarcated lines, the hues are applied with balayage technique, which results in a beautiful blend. Bengaluru-based makeup and hair stylist Kiinjal Mehta says, “This technique a blend of dark and light tones, but in shades of brown and blondes. The best thing about these multi-tone is that it gives a voluminous look.”
No wonder social media is flooded with fashionistas showing off their locks in style.
