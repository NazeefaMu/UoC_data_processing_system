Rajitha says Ryan Jayalath arrest attempt unacceptable

Nobody can approve of the manner in which an attempt was made to arrest the Convener of the Medical Student’s Action Committee Ryan Jayalath, said Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Rajitha Senartne.
Addressing the Cabinet press briefing yesterday, the Minister said that these kind of incidents would put the government in to difficulty.
“I immediately called the IGP and questioned about the manner in which he was arrested. Ryan Jayalath was no Rohana Wijeweera to arrest him in such a manner. The police executed the orders of the Court; there were five warrants against Jayalath. The Crime Investigative Department officials have power to go in Civvies and arrest him, but Ryan could have been easily arrested,”the Minister said.
When questioned as to whether there was any conspiracy behind it, the Minister said that only the government had changed and not the state.
Police Media Spokesperson ASP Ruwan Gunasekara said the IGP had already informed Western Province Senior DIG to conduct an investigation to ascertain whether there was a discrepancy regarding the official duties.
“The DIG would submit the report in two or three days. If the report states that there was a discrepancy regarding the official duty, disciplinary action will be taken against those officials,” he said.
