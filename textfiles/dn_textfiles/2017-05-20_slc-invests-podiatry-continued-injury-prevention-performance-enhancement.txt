SLC invests in Podiatry in continued injury prevention & performance enhancement measures

Sri Lanka Cricket announced on Friday the latest in a series of injury prevention & management measures of its national performance squads with the introduction of the services of former Olympic [swim] medallist and elite athlete, Australian Pediatrics Dr. Nicholas Sprenger.
Sprenger is one of the Gold Coast’s most respected Podiatrist who practices in all aspects of conservative care of the foot and ankle, as well as post-operative care following orthopaedic surgery of the foot and ankle. As an athlete himself, he has a special interest in Sports Podiatry and has been working with the Queensland Academy of Sports Athletes, the Queensland Rugby League Referees and the Brisbane Lions AFL.
Identifying an unusually high incidence of injuries plaguing the national performance squads (NPS) of Sri Lanka, the Executive Committee of SLC contracted the services of Sprenger, who has spent the past week in Colombo in sessions with the NPS, including the 17 players who departed the island for the Champions Trophy last morning.
In sessions spanning over 30 minutes each, individual players were assessed through passive, active & dynamic testing and casting moulds prepared for each player. Customised Orthotics will be manufactured to suit the requirements of each individual player, who will be delivered this advantage by the end of June this year.
Expressing his views on the successful sessions conducted by Dr. Sprenger SLC Training & Rehabilitation Manager (HP) Nirmalan Thanabalasingam said
“The use of podiatry, and in particular a podiatrist of Dr. Sprenger’s skill will help us provide the players with the best possible orthotics. This is an investment in to the future and will help improve performance, minimise fatigue and reduce the risk of injury”

“As a player who benefited from the services of a Podiatrist back in 1999 when we were provided this opportunity by the then SLC President Thilanga Sumathipala, I’m really happy to see this obtained for the national players”
said former Sri Lankan new-ball seamer and Consultant Fast Bowling Coach Chaminda Vaas “I experienced first-hand the value of corrective orthotics and, I am very happy to see SLC investing once again into these important areas that had been neglected for so long as they will reap immense benefit to the players not only in the short term, but in the long run as well” he concluded.

Podiatry is the science of the study, diagnosis, and medical and surgical treatment of disorders of the foot, ankle and lower extremity.
Sport podiatry, a sub-specialty of podiatric medicine, involves the expertise in diagnosis of foot and lower limb problems as well as treatments such as joint mobilisation, advanced biomechanical assessments, soft-tissue manipulation and trigger point therapy, advanced functional orthotic therapy, exercise rehabilitation, exercise prescription [strength and conditioning] of the lower extremities and footwear prescription for the professional, elite, amateur and young athletes. Sports podiatry covers foot and lower limb chronic overuse injuries & mechanical performance enhancement to minimise injury and to maximise efficiency.
