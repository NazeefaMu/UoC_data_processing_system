Jenkins  to direct  ‘Wonder Woman 2’

Patty Jenkins, who gave DC its most successful film, 'Wonder Woman', this year, is in final negotiations to sign on to direct its sequel. The sequel was confirmed last month at San Diego Comic- Con and a December 13, 2019 release date was also announced for the same.
Gal Gadot has also been tapped to return for the sequel but Jenkins has yet to sign the second film in the new DC franchise.
According to Deadline, a studio source confirmed they were "confident the deal will be reached soon" which could reportedly make Jenkins the highest-paid female director in Hollywood. PTI
