I was unfairly removed from my post: Monetary Board Secretary

The Secretary to the Monetary Board H.A.Karunaratne yesterday said that he was unfairly removed from his post in the Monetary Board by former Governor Arjun Mahendran in June, 2016.
Karunaratne said he felt his removal was ‘a compulsory expulsion’.
He also said he felt contented when the present CBSL Governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy reappointed him as the Secretary to the Monetary Board after he took office.
Karunaratne said he received a letter from the former CBSL Governor Mahendran calling for an explanation for attempting to distribute a letter issued by the Sri Lanka’s Central Bank Executive Officers Union at a Monetary Board meeting.
Karunaratne explained to the Commission that the said Union had formally requested him to distribute the said letter at the meeting.
Karunaratne said to the Commission that he then sought the permission of Governor Mahendran to distribute the letter.
“Since Governor Mahendran did not agree with the suggestion, I did not distribute the letter among the Monetary Board members,” he said.
Karunaratne said when he received a circular relocating his duties he was both shocked and surprised.
Asked if there had been any other disagreements between himself and former Governor Mahendran, Karunaratne said to his knowledge they do not.
The Commission pointed out it is not interested in the personal problems between the mentioned two individuals. Karunaratne was testifying before the Presidential Commission to inquire into the Treasury Bond Issue. State Counsel Shaheeda Barrie led the evidence.
