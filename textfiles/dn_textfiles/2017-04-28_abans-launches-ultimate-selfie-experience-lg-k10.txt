Abans launches ultimate Selfie experience with LG K10

Taking solo or group selfies tends to be a highly cumbersome experience. This is because the process of taking a selfie usually involves spending time on finding the perfect camera angle, straining to activate the camera shutter, and then, wading through multiple blurry photos to select that perfect shot.
Abans recently launched LG K10, a part of the LG K Series lineup, was equipped with a wide angle selfie camera, I was highly intrigued and decided to check out this new smartphone.
Projecting itself as the epitome of cutting-edge design and innovation, the LG K10 focuses on reinventing how we capture special moments, while offering up incredibly high performance.
Redefining the Selfie Experience: Unlike other smartphones that simply facilitate our selfie experience, the LG K10 aims to redefine it with the unique 1200 Wide Angle Selfie Camera.
When testing out this camera, I noted how much easier it was to take a selfie shot. The wide angle allowed me to take a crisp, clear group shot that included both family and friends without using a selfie stick or cropping anyone out.
The Gesture Shot and Interval Shot was especially cool as it prevented the shaky, blurry shots that often occur while capturing selfies. So, all I had to do was just close my hand to start the 3-second timer, and it immediately took a clear, perfect selfie.
Fit, Finish and Display:The LG K10 imparts an overall premium feel with its curved elemental design that is sleeker and slimmer as compared to other smartphones in the market.
Therefore, in marked contrast to other smartphone brands, the LG K10 offers you exemplary features that provide exceptional selfie shots without compromising on performance.
Hence, does this smartphone raise the standard for capturing selfies in Sri Lanka? The answer would be yes.
So, if you are yearning for a smartphone that lets you capture breath-taking selfie shots, the LG K10 is the perfect choice for you.
