A popular face on the ramp, Jake works as a personal trainer, helping out young individuals in achieving their physical goals. He is also engaged in activities at the ‘Walk with Brien Kerkoven’ academy where he trains young, aspiring models.

The heat- It affects me in ways you cannot imagine! It triggers uncontrollable sneezing as it is uncomfortable and embarrassing at the same time. I turn red like a tomato which my friends find hilarious. (Scowls)

It’s technique that is the winning formula, not weight.
