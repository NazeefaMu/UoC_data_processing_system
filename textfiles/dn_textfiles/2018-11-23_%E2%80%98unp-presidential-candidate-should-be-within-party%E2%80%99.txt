‘UNP Presidential candidate  should be from within party’

Badulla District UNP MP Chaminda Wijesiri said UNP MPs should give preference to country rather than the political party they represent. The UNP party leadership should be given to a person of the people’s choice.
He was speaking at a media briefing in Bandarawela.
UNP MP Wijesiri went on to say that in the event the party decides to name a common candidate, that candidate should be a person representing the United National Party.
He told the media that the party intends naming a common candidate at the next Presidential Election and that candidate should be from the UNP. “I will not agree to any other person being named and I am committed to seeing that our party names the UNP candidate at the next Presidential Election,” he said. “If the UNP fails to name a candidate from our party, I will have to take a decision giving preference to country and not to the political party to which I belong,” he said.
