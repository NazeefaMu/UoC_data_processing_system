Renovation of Polonnaruwa-Batticaloa railway line complete in two years

 
The renovation work of the Polonnaruwa-Batticaloa railway line which has been suspended for many years due to the conflict will be commenced shortly to facilitate an efficient passenger and goods transportation.
Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said that the restoration project will be completed within two years.
Minister De Silva made these remarks during an observation tour in Polonnaruwa Railway station today.
Over 12,000 sleepers are required for the reconstruction of 90 kilometer long railway line between Polonnaruwa and Batticaloa and around 10,000 sleepers have already been brought to the site.
“Currently, trains run on this line at a very low speed of 60km per hour due to many bridges and over 60 culverts. But, trains can speed over 100 km per hour easily after the renovation reducing the time needed to travel passengers between Polonnaruwa and Batticaloa,” said the Minister.
He further said that the encroachment by people on the railway land is a main reason to delay the renovation. Steps will be taken to remove unauthorized occupants according to existing circulars approved by the Cabinet for the eviction of people.
Land surveying and mapping are being conducted currently to acquire lands belonging to the Sri Lanka Railways.
