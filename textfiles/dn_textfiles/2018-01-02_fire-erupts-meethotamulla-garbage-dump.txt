Fire erupts at Meethotamulla garbage dump

A fire broke out in a section of the Meethotamulla garbage dump yesterday, Police said.
Vehicles deployed by the fire brigade were able to douse the fire in a short period of time.
The fire is reported to have erupted due to the methane gas building up in the dump.
There have been several similar incidents at the site previously as well.
