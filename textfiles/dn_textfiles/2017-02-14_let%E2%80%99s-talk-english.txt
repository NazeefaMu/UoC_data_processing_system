Let’s talk English

‘I believe English is a language which will help us to keep from destroying ourselves’ says Liz England.
Liz England is a professor of English as a second language and also conducts a programme called ‘Teaching English to speakers of other languages’. She mostly works in the USA where her career began. Liz counts herself lucky to come to Sri Lanka among a number of other countries for short term assignments. She has lived in Egypt for six years where she worked at the American University in Cairo Egypt. She also worked in Hong Kong at the Hong Kong Institute of Education and worked in Indonesia with a programme called the English Language Fellows Programme which is a joint project between George Town University and US Department of State. The experienced professor sat down with Daily News to share her thoughts on English education around the globe.
Q. Why is learning English important?
A. If you have a language you share with your enemies or with your friends you can communicate with them.
You don’t have to be worried or afraid. You don’t need to take a gun out. You don’t have to be afraid because you can talk to them.
Even if it is different English, we can still communicate. I believe English is a language which will help the world to keep ourselves from destruction.
When people talk and listen to each other we can have a peaceful world for us and for our children.
Q. You are an English Language specialist. What does that mean? Can you define your vocation?
A. My focus is on University based English Language Teacher Education and the teachers not only in the USA but all over the world want to take up a Post Graduate Degree, a Masters in Teaching English as a second language.
I do research in this field while I teach classics in the University and I also get invited to do projects with the public education system in the USA. The schools that educate children from other countries need help with teacher training to teach English as a second language.
I do community service as well. In fact in programmes such as this, it might be called ‘Service to the profession’, because I am serving people who are not really my students and they are not in a USA University, so I have the opportunity to do international service which is a very big gift for me, I love doing it.
Q. Tell me a little bit about your early education and your beginnings?
A. I worked with some Vietnamese refugees in the USA. I was involved with my church that sponsored some refugees. As members of the church we went to their homes to help them, since it is difficult for refugees in the beginning to settle down.
So in 1977, I was in Madison Wisconsin and looked after a Vietnamese family of 25.
And in December in Wisconsin the weather is very cold with ice everywhere. The family suffered quite a lot.
I fell in love with communicating in English which was the second language of that family.
Q. What are some of the projects you have worked on?
A. In general my projects involve various aspects of English Language Teacher Education. I was recently in Russia and I did a project called English for specific purposes with Universities. Someone might be taking classes to get Masters in Business Administration, Engineering or Law. But English is special in a certain academic or scholarly discipline.
So our programme in Russia was about English for Specific purposes in the University setting. In contrast in Sri Lanka our project has been more general.
We have been linking with a variety of groups and individuals and had meetings in some Universities and the task was with teachers of English. We have worked with interns and third years students in the NIE (National Institute of Education). We have worked with a variety of people and we also did some Ministry trainer training. The Ministry has an arm that does training for teachers in service training and we recently did a project with them in Galle and had a wonderful experience. We were in Jaffna, Kandy and Colombo and Matara covering all the way from the North of Sri Lanka to the South.
Q. Why did you choose to become an English Language specialist?
A. In the USA you take Bachelors, Masters and Phd. After my Phd I was offered a job at the American University in Cairo Egypt in 1984. I went to Egypt with my family and I was a professor in teaching English as a second language but we were also taught Arabic as a second language, because in Egypt people speak Arabic.
I aquired some skills there that later became very important in the world. My mother was very worried about me going so far away from my home in New York but it was very fruitful and not long after I was invited that to do a programme in the Czech Republic which is in the Eastern Part of Europe in 1992. It was my first international consultancy and there I worked with Russian teachers who aspired to become English teachers. We were given six weeks to help them speak English.
We were invited to work with 60 teacher leaders in the different schools in the Czech Republic, a smaller country than Sri Lanka.
We helped them to learn how to use and teach English to the children from kindergarten to Grade 12 in the Czech Republic. It was an extraordinary experience because the teachers were so eager to learn but had so much to teach in just six weeks and within three months a Russian teacher had to be an English teacher.
Q. What kind of work have you done for universities, ministries, and private and government agencies?
A. The US government projects with which I have worked includes the one in Sri Lanka and in Nepal, our next stop.
The projects are often identified by the US embassy in that country. They will have a project or more and then the regional English language officer, finds somebody who can help the job I do as an English Language Specialist.
So I was invited to come here and do this project with the US Embassy in Sri Lanka where we got the opportunity to work with a wide range.
In some cases it is a very narrow range, but here there were many needs and there were many projects for us, out of which we chose some that seemed realistic for the time and the resources we had.
Q. Your projects focused on language programme design, implementation and evaluation. Can you give me some examples?
A. In Sri Lanka we have not done much programme evaluation. We have really focused on teacher education and finding new tools to help teachers tackle issues or challenges that they identify or perhaps the ministry identifies which in return will improve their teaching. The most important point about the Sri Lankan project was the teachers were 100 per cent enthusiastic, positive and engaged.
The teachers were very keen. Sometimes the ministry makes it compulsory to take the training even though the teachers don’t want it and they feel like they are being forced to take the training. We had none of those issues here. So there were very specific benefits for individual groups and leaders.
Q. Has your stay in Sri Lanka been a success?
A. I have never been to Sri Lanka before. This is my first visit and I have had a very positive personal and professional experience. The programme here was well organised and there was plenty of work. For me it has been great. I believe I will go back to the USA with some long lasting friendships from Sri Lanka. So I think it was successful.
Q. You have spent ten years at Shenandoah University in 2016. What was the nature of your work there?
A. We have a Master’s Degree Programme which I directed there. It was a programme for the Post Graduate Students where the students have to follow a series of eleven courses in order to be prepared to teach English. Ours was an online programme and I wrote a book about online teachers’ education. It is very different from what you and I know, to be sitting in the classroom listening to a professor. Learning Online requires different skills. So we wrote a book that was designed to help teacher trainers and teachers to learn online in a distance environment. I think there is great potential for online and distant teacher education in Sri Lanka as well.
