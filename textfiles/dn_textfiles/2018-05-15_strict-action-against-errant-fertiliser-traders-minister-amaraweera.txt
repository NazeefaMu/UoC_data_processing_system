Strict action against errant fertiliser traders: Minister Amaraweera

Strict legal action will be taken against those who attempt to sell subsidised fertiliser at a higher price, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
During a meeting held recently at the Ministry with the representatives of farmer organisations, Minister Amaraweera said the government has taken measures to provide subsidised fertiliser to farmers under the re-implemented fertiliser subsidy programme.
According to the Minister, around 705,370 farmers will be benefitted under this programme during this Yala season and 1,103,861.87 acres of land are scheduled to be cultivated.
The government has allocated Rs. 32,500 million for the programme.
Under this programme, a 50kg bag of fertiliser will be sold to paddy farmers at Rs. 500 and the fertiliser will be issued through Agrarian Services Centres.
A bag of fertiliser for farmers who grow other crops will be sold at Rs. 1,500.
“The price of a 50kg bag of fertiliser in the open market is Rs. 1,500 and the public can make complaints with regard to errant traders to the Ministry which will take measures to cancel their licenses,” he added.
