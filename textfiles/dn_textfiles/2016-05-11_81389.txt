Rain washes out final day’s play – match drawn

CHELMSFORD: The touring Sri Lankan team had their work cut out when rain on the third and final day forced them to settle for a draw against Essex here on Tuesday.
Heavy rain washed out play before lunch on the third day and forced the umpires to abandon the match without a ball bowled.
Sri Lanka who trailed Essex on the first innings by 158 runs were 42-2 when played ended on the second day.
The tourists now move to Leicester where they take on Leicestershire in another three-day game starting on Friday (May 13).
It will be their final practice game before the first Test against England at Headingley, Leeds from May 19.
