Foreign Minister Amunugama briefs Colombo-based diplomats

Foreign Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama briefed foreign diplomats based in Colombo at the Foreign Affairs Ministry yesterday.
The Minister clarified the chain of events that compelled President Maithripala Sirisena to arrive at the decision to dissolve Parliament.
He emphasised the constitutionality of the steps taken by President Sirisena and added that having being elected through a nation-wide vote, the President derives his authority directly from the people of Sri Lanka.
The Minister said in the event of a conflict between the organs of government, seeking a mandate from people who are sovereign ensures that democracy prevails.
Minister Amunugama also made special note of the peaceful atmosphere that continues to prevail in Sri Lanka, in the midst of internal political changes.
This is to the credit of the people of Sri Lanka and re-affirms the democratic traditions of the country. Through the measures adopted, the Minister added, the Executive has discharged his responsibility of ensuring the security and safety of all Sri Lankans, which may have been compromised by the growing tension and the departure from parliamentary traditions.
Several country representatives present at the briefing expressed their confidence in the strength of Sri Lanka’s long-standing democratic traditions in resolving this internal matter.
