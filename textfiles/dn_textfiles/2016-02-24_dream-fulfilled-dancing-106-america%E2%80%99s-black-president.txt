Dream fulfilled: Dancing, at 106, with America’s black President

US: This is the adorable moment a 106-year-old woman met President Barack Obama for the first time - and turned it into a dance party.
The minute Virginia McLaurin sees Obama as she walks into the White House she yells ‘Hi!’ to the President, opening her arms wide with excitement as he comes over and takes her hands.
‘How are you?’ he asks, a huge grin on his face. ‘I’m fine,’ she replies, already dancing excitedly.
‘Oh it’s so nice to see you,’ Obama says and she tells him ‘It’s an honour, it’s an honour’.
Obama then asks Virginia if she wants to say hi to Michelle and she enthusastically waves to the First Lady and says ‘Yes’.
Still holding Obama’s hands, she immediately begins walking over as Obama jokingly tells her to slow down. ‘She’s 106!’ Obama tells Michelle. ‘No you are not! Oh my goodness,’ Michelle responds. ‘I wanna be like you when I grow up,’ she tells Virginia.
‘You can,’ Virginia says with a smile, as she starts to dance.
Michelle immediately joins in and Obama grabs Virginia’s hand to join the groove session, asking her ‘What’s the secret to still dancing at 106?’
‘Just keep movin’ she says as Michelle continues to dance with her.
‘We’re so happy to have you here,’ the First Lady tells her, ‘and look at those nails!’, she says, admiring Virginia’s purple manicure.
The overjoyed Virginia continues to dance in the middle of the couple, letting out a ‘Wooo!’ as they take some pictures. ‘I thought I would never live to get in the White House,’ Virginia tells then the president. ‘Well you are right here!’ Obama and Michelle exclaim.
‘And I tell you,’ Virginia continues. ‘I am so happy. A black President’, she says, shaking Obama’s hand and looking at him with pride.
‘And I’m here to celebrate black history. Yea! That’s what I’m here for,’ she adds, doing a little jig again.
‘We’re glad to have you here,’ a beaming Obama tells her as Virginia laughs. ‘You have just made our day,’ Michelle says. ‘You know that? That energy.’ ‘Well,’ Virginia says. ‘You made my day.’
Virginia’s White House dance party came a year after a petition was launched to help get her an invite.
She posted a video on YouTube telling Obama how much she’d love to meet him and his family and on Sunday her dream finally came true.
