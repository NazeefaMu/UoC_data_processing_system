Model village opens in Kirigankumbura

Mihindumgama, the model village constructed in the Kirigankumbura area in Udadumbara, Kandy was opened under the patronage of Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa, yesterday.
Mihindumgama comprises 24 housing units. It has been built on a land extent spanning three acres. Each house has a home garden with an extent of 20 perches.
The Minister said this was the 57th model village to be opened under the model village programme. A total of 670 model villages are being constructed in the country at present. Out of the 670 villages, eight villages are being constructed in the Kandy district.
He said his vision is to construct 2,500 model villages in the country by 2025. The village has all facilities such as electricity, drinking water and access roads.
Uduadumbara U.N.P. organizer Chanaka Ilapperuma, addressing the gathering, said the 24 house owners of the village were selected as they had faced a number of natural disasters and some of them do not even have an inch of land.
Parallel to this programme, 195 families were granted the Samurupiyasa loan in collaboration with Minister Lakshman Kiriella. Hundred families were offered eye spectacles and Rs. 38,000 worth mason tool sets were offered to 60 residents of the area. The total investment on the project was Rs. 34 million rupees.
