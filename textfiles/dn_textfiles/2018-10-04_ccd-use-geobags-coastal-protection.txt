CCD to use Geobags for coastal protection

The Hydromec International (Pvt) Ltd recently supplied a large quantity of Geobags to the Coast Conservation Department (CCD) to protect Sea Lankan beaches from possible sea erosion.
Geobags which are filled with sand, coal or cement, manufactured with woven geo-textiles, used by countries in order to protect coastal and inland waterways including ponds, dams, tanks and lagoons from erosion and also to create a tourist friendly environment along sea beaches world over. Geobags aremorestable hydraulically and geo technically since the bags are heavier and wider with high proportional ratio.
The bags available in the various sizes and are also used in riverbank, beach protection and offshore breakwater.
A research team of Engineers from the Coast Conservation Department (CCD), after a thorough study of the importance of using geobags for coastal conservation rather than using boulders, recently purchased 750 geobags from Hydromec International, the local agent of Belgium based Bonar NV.
Bonar Nv is a leader in Geotextile productions that are highly used in countries including Belgium, Holland, Germany and USA for coastal protections in coastal belts, sera beaches and river banks. Bonar Nv was introduced to Sri Lanka by Hydromec International (Pvt) Ltd in 1995 and is a regular supplier of Geotextiles to the Coast Conservation Department.
Speaking to Daily News Business, Hydromec International (Pvt) Ltd, Chairman, D. R. P Abeyasinghe said that this is the first time that the Coast Conservation Department has decided to use environmental friendly Geobags at places where sea erosion badly destroy the beaches.
“Geobags are suited especially for tourist areas, not only it is environmental friendly but also the colour of geobags blends perfectly with the landscape of sea beaches,” he said.
Chairman Abeyasinghe further said that geobags can be produced in different design for different requirements. The materials used for Geo Bag fabrication are polypropylene or polyesterpolyester textile fabric.
It is said that geobagswhich are also called as Geotextile Sand Containers (GSC) could be manufactured at a very low cost.
Geobags are highly used by countries that depend on tourism industry. They are mainly used for coastal protections, especially for beach protections. Geobagand Geotube technology is used to protect shore lines, rebuilt beaches and also to reduce water turbidity or wider beaches with improved sand.
“Geobags are manufactured with freely available filtered sand is cost effective against rock transport, handling charges, labour cost etc,” he said.
