Specialists allowed to work upto 63 in state hospitals

The retirement age of medical consultants (specialist doctors) has been increased up to 63, Public Administration Ministry sources said.
The retirement age for consultants was 60 and it has been increased up to 63 through a gazette notification effective retrospectively from June 6, 2017.
The gazette notification issued on August 27 ( last Monday).The decision has been taken due to the shortage of medical consultants in Sri Lanka.
Consultants said that there is a huge demand for the Sri Lankan medical consultants from other countries because of the quality of medical education and training they received from state medical faculties and state hospitals.
