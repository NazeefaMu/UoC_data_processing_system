Pivithuru Hela Urumaya commends government decision to ban polythene

 
The Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) commended the government's decision to ban polythene bags and food wrappers.
 PHU leader and Parliamentarian Udaya Prabath Gammanpila said that he respects the decision taken to ban polythene bags and food wrappers but the government had made the move in a way that creates many issues.
"First thing is that the government has given only three months to find an alternative solution," MP Gammanpila said.
"Actually it is not enough to import an environment friendly substitute for polythene bags and food wrappers."
He made these observations today while addressing a press conference held at the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya political Office in Pitakotte.
He added that polythene bags and food wrappers industry is maintained at mass scale and domestic level.
"A large number of people are affected by this decision”, MP Gammanpila said.
"Government also should take measures to find an alternative product to polythene bags and food wrappers as well as a solution to those who are affected by the sudden ban. However I appreciate this decision”, he said.
