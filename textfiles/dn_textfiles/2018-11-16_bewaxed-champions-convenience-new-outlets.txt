BeWaxed Champions Convenience with New Outlets

When it comes to waxing, Sri Lanka’s premier and dedicated waxing salon BeWaxed has made a name for itself as the go-to place in the last five years. Since its inception Founder Durga Kenny and her team have become household names among women in Colombo, the suburbs and even in key cities across the island.
Further concentrating on the “convenience” factor, BeWaxed recently launched its “VIP Services” exclusively for ladies who prefer to have their waxing issues dealt with in the comfort of their own homes.
Using the signature Sugar and Special waxes, BeWaxed undertakes all forms of waxing requirements including the full body wax at your residence. Since the service is much sought after, a week’s prior notice though is advisable.
For those who have “waxing emergencies” during the day, on the way to a meeting or when you have a few hours in-between running errands, BeWaxed has been setting up “Express” outlets around the city of Colombo. The latest one in the heart of the city was opened at Colombo 7 recently.
Speaking at the opening of the outlet Founder of BeWaxed Durga Kenny noted, “A lot of our customers are busy women balancing careers and family. The express outlets are designed in such a way that ladies can utilize a lunch break to get a quick waxing or scrub done. We have also strategically placed them in highly corporate environment to make it easily accessible.
The Colombo 02 and Colombo 03 outlets have been doing so well and we’ve had many requests for outlets in other areas as well. Colombo 7 therefore is just the beginning.”
This new branch will also offer body waxing and body scrubs among a range of other services. The express outlet is open from 9am – 6pm every day except Sundays and Poya days.
