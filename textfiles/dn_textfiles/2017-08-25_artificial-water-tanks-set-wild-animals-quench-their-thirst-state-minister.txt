Artificial water tanks set up for wild animals to quench their thirst: State Minister

During the prevailing drought in Puttalam and Thabbowa area, several artificial water tanks have been set in the Puttalam Thabbowa Abhaya Bhoomi area in order that the wild animals living in the nearby area could quench their thirst.
The artificial water tanks have been set up under the guidance of State Minister Palitha Ranga Bandara.
The State Minister's project is being implemented with the help of Police officers, Wildlife Conservation officers, Forest Department officers and also with the help of the general public.
Due to the drought, the water level in these water storages and small water tanks (Villu) have decreased, while the wild animals face difficulties in quenching their thirst.
Accordingly, to overcome these difficulties faced by wild animals, small water tanks have been dug, while polythene had been spread inside the holes. Water has been pumped over the polythene by bowsers, while water tanks have been set.
