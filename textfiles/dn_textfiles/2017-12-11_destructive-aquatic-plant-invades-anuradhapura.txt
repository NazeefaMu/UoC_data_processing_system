Destructive aquatic plant invades Anuradhapura

A unidentified aquatic plant is invading the Anuradhapura Mahakanadarawa reservoir. The Mahakanadawara Integrated Farmer Organisation has submitted a report on the situation to Anuradhapura Government Agent R.M. Wanninayake and to the district agriculture committee in this regard.
The plant could block the reservoir and other water sources in the area, the report warns.
The Daily News reported its invasion with photos in its November 24 issue.
A three-day operation to remove the plant was carried out initiated by the Government Agent. Army, Police and staff of the Anuradhapura District Disaster Management Centre participated in the programme.
Wanninayake told the Daily News the initiative is a temporary measure taken to prevent the plant from spreading. Well-organized large scale programme would be conducted assisted by the Zonal Irrigation Director and universities to destroy the plant in the near future, he said.
