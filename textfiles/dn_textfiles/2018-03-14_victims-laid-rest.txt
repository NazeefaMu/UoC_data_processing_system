Periyakulam Tank tragedy:
Victims laid to rest

The funeral of the five who tragically drowned in the Periyakulam Tank was held at the Velur Hindu Cemetery in Nilaweli, on March 12.
A large multitude of people belonging to all communities attended, as the tragedy had caused grief in the entire village. The five were buried together in one grave.
The deceased are Dharmalingam Thangadorai of Division 2, Nilaweli, his eldest daughter Thangadorai Sangavi (9), Suresh Sudeshan (7) and Suresh Keiraj (9), children of a brother-in-law of Thangadorai, and Suganden Branavi, daughter of Ratna Bhavan Suganthan, another brother-in-law of Thangadorai.
Thangadorai was an owner-driver of two buses and was also involved in paddy cultivation. He used to offer a deva dana after every harvest season. This time too he had prepared a dana for offering and had ventured into the Periyakulam Tank in a boat with the children to pick lotus flowers for the dana, when the tragedy occurred.
