‘Sri Lanka will survive in dollar appreciation’

US dollar appreciation will not affect Sri Lanka that much. Even developed countries in Asia gets the heat of the dollar appreciation. The government cannot be blamed over the issue, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
He was addressing a meeting organised to welcome Beliatta SLFP Organiser Upali Mohotti, who is also Paddy Marketing Board Chairman.
The Minister said the trade war between China and America sometimes badly impact on Sri Lanka’s economy.
The rupee depreciates almost daily now. Many put the blame on the government to tarnish its image.
The Minister said that when they came into power in 2015, the country has caught up in a huge debt trap set by the previous regime. The foreign reserves of the country is used to repay them. RW
