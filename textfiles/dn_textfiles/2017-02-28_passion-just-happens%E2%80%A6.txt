Passion just happens…

Muhanned Cader has little to say. His answers too, are vague. He is also completely unpretentious. In other words he is a completely orthodox artist. All this comes down to the fact that the contents of his mind are better defined by his works of art. That is what makes him comfortable. Like many artists, he is able to better articulate his ideas through forms. Through pictures. His forms too are extremely subtle. They are completely open to interpretation. Absolutely abstract. Completely subjective. Daily News visited the Barefoot Gallery to talk to Muhanned Cader, only to be confronted with the imperceptible.
“My creations just come into my head. I have been doing this for a long time. My latest show which I am previewing at the Barefoot Gallery, ‘GLUEANDSTICK’ is an abstract work.
It is another way of thinking. These works are hand one with Collage.
Then they are digitally printed. Most of these works are from my sketch books. The sketch books are mine and this is a way of transferring it into another language. When I do it hand done, the collages, it is transferred into a digital format,” said Cader.
Cader has been involved in art for the past 25 years.
“This is my fifth solo at Barefoot. I have done quite a few solos over the time in UK, America and India. I have a style but I do not show the same thing over and over again. There is something different. I look at nature and retain it in my memory. I see something and keep it in my head. And then I put that on paper. It is not the same thing but the essence of it,” stated Cader
Cader works mostly with abstracts and also paint landscapes. And this show GLUEANDSTICK has abstracts but there is a landscape element to it.
“It is how you perceive my pictures. Different people perceive my pics in different ways. You are allowed to interpret it as you please. My pictures are also quite subtle. The beauty of it is that it is perceived differently by different people. I want to get better at my work by self- teaching and self- discipline through art and giving people pleasure,” added Cader.
Born in Sri Lanka and having lived most of his life in Sri Lanka, he has been abroad and has taught in Sri Lanka. He also has studied in Chicago at the Art Institute.
“You have to be passionate about art otherwise you cannot work. Passion just happens. I don’t know what drives me to do it,” said Cader
Cader’s work is Collage works transferred into digital print. The work is done on paper with magazines cuttings. Basically Collage transformed into digital format.
“My father used to have a lot of art works and that is how I got into it. I have looked at books and painters. I have been doing this for so long I now have my own language. It has been a lot of practice and a lot of shows. I also enjoy doing these shows and it has been hard work. It has to be good and of high quality,” informed Cader.
Cader is also into movies and different forms of music. This he enjoys. His wife is also an artist who does exhibitions. They met when he was teaching in Lahore.
“Art is politics. It is a political point of view. My work keeps me thinking. And I felt that I wanted to show the world my passion. It is a lot of work as there are 80 pieces in this exhibition. My future dreams are to keep on painting and see where it takes me. I just want to keep working and see where it takes me,” explained Cader.
People having an open mind is most welcome to Cader.
“I would love them to have an open mind. I don’t want to spoon feed people. When it is an abstract you cannot pin point what everything means. It is nothing to do with that. It is working with spaces,” pointed out Cader.
Many artists have been inspired by the pain they have felt in life. Cader too has felt this.
“You suck in the energy of everything. And then you put it out in the form that you know. What you see in the world you absorb and put it into other forms.
It needs to work together. When you see my work you can immediately know it is the same artist. So you are always searching. And you never stop learning. It is a hard life being an artist,” expressed Cader.
