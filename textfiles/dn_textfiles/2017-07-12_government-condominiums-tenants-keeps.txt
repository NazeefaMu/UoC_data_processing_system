Government condominiums to tenants for keeps

The government has appointed a Task Force to develop a mechanism to transfer state owned condominium and non-condominium properties to those who have lived in them for more than 15 years.
The Condominium Management Authority has invited the relevant families to provide their information, in pursuance of government policy of empowering 3 million citizens to become land and house owners.
“A Committee was appointed by the Housing and Construction Ministry for the establishment of a clearly defined, fair, stable and enforceable system of property rights in land and housing,” Authority sources said.
Presenting his Economic Policy Statement in 2015, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe pledged to empower three million citizens to become land and house owners. The government is addressing this commitment on several fronts. Proposals for the modernization of the surveys and registration systems have already been mooted, while new initiatives for recognizing the rights and legitimacy of the urban poor have been launched.
Seeking the transfer of state owned houses to their long term occupants is one of the key objectives of the government and around 1,000 families, including those who resettled after Tsunami will also be benefitted through this initiative.
