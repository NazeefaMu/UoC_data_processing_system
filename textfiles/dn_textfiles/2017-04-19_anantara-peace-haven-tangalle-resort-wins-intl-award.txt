Anantara Peace Haven Tangalle Resort wins int'l award

Anantara Peace Haven Tangalle Resort has been recognised in Cond‚ Nast Traveler US's prestigious 2017 Hot List as one of the best new hotels in the world, as well as one of the hottest new openings in Sri Lanka.
This is the fourth significant international award the resort has won since opening. The property has established itself as one of the leading resorts on the island to travellers both from abroad and locally. Due to this strong support, Anantara Tangalle has achieved significant international and local recognition, including in Conde Nast Traveler Readers’ Choice Awards in 2016, being named on Destin Asian magazine's 2016 Luxe List and being awarded by Wine Spectator in 2016 for its Il Mare restaurant.
The Cond‚ Nast Traveler Hot List recognises the best new properties around the world and is by far one of the most well regarded awards a hotel can win. Cond‚ Nast Traveler picked 75 hotels on six continents for its annual Hot List, which is announced today. A team of 60 editors and reporters visited 50 countries to review hundreds of new properties first-hand. They came back with the most outstanding winners that represent not just the best of the best of the world, but where travellers will be heading next.
