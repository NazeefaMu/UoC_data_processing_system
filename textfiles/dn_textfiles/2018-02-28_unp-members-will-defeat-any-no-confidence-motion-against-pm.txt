'UNP members will defeat any no confidence motion against the PM'

Puttlam District UNP Parliamentarian Hector Appuhamy stated that the UNP members would defeat any no confidence motion moved against Prime Minister and UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament.
MP Appuhamy also pointed out that had State Minister Palitha Range Bandara any issue, he had to solve it within the party. "Revealing it to the media and speaking about it to others could not be accepted," MP Appuhamy said, adding that "It was a violation of decipline." MP Appuhamy also said that had Range Bandara discussed the matter within the party, we could have considered assisting him in finding a solution to his issue. He added that the members were unable to assist moves that was totally against descipline.
