Van crashes into transformer injuring 15 family members

A family of 15 members was seriously injured and admitted to the Dambulla Hospital when the van they were travelling in ran off the Dambulla–Anuradhapura Road at Bulagala and crashed onto a transformer on June 17 morning, Dambulla police said.
The injured are residents of Boralanda, Welimada. They were travelling to Vavuniya to see a bride for a member of their family when the van veered off the road.
Police said the van driven at high speed had crashed into the transformer and toppled at a paddy field. The neighbours and commuters from a passing bus had rushed the injured to the hospital. Eight women, five men and two children are among the injured.
Investigations are continuing.
