RI, fine for rape

A suspect who had been found guilty of raping a 16-year-old girl, was sentenced to 2 years rigorous imprisonment, suspended for five years and fined Rs. 30,000 by Kurunegala High Court Judge Menaka Wijesundara yesterday.
The 32-year-old accused, a resident of Polpitigama was indicted for sexually abusing the girl who was on her way back home from school on January 1, 2014. He is a father two children.
In addition to the fine, the Judge ordered him to pay Rs. 75,000 as compensation to the victim. State Counsel Charaka Dharmasiri stated that the prosecution had proved the charges against the accused beyond doubt. The Judge observed that the accused would have to serve another six-months rigorous imprisonment in default of the fine and a two-years rigorous imprisonment in default of the compensation. The Defence Counsel appearing for the suspect told the Court that his client wished to amicably settle the case by apologising to the girl. The Judge refused the request of the defence lawyer and delivered the judgement.
