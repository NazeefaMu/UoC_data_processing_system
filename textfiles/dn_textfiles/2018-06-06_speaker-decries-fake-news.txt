Speaker Jayasuriya informed that he had received 11 pages out of 360 pages of unpublished sections of the Bond Commission report yesterday morning from the Presidential Secretariat.
“Once I receive the entire report, I will make it available to all MPs. The complete report would be tabled in Parliament,” the Speaker said.
