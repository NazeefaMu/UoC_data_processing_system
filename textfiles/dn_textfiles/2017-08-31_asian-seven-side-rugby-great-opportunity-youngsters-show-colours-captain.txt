Asian Seven-a-side Rugby: Great opportunity for youngsters to show colours - Captain Muthuthanthri

Sri Lanka rugby sevens captain for the Asia Sevens Championship in Hong Kong, Sudarshana Muthuthanthri was very optimistic about Lankan young blood and said hopefully our youngsters will make this an opportunity to show their potential, despite many key players sans the tournament due to injuries when the first leg of the tournament starts at the King's Park stadium tomorrow.
The former Lankan sevens captain Dhanushka Ranjan along with Anuruddh Wilwara, Srinath Sooriyabandara, Richard Dharmapala and Shehan Pathirana were not included in the squad to Hong Kong due to injuries. Navy's Chanaka Chandimal also withdrew from the squad at the last moment on medical grounds. Adding salt to the wounds, one of Sri Lanka's finest fly half players, Fazil Marija did not make his presence in the side, citing his private commitments.
As a result Sri Lanka's U-20 Asian Sevens captain Naveen Heenakankanamege, Buddhima Piyaratne and Navy Sports Club's Sumith Dhananjaya will make their debut in the national squad. Chanaka Chandimal's last moment exit allowed Havelock SC's Kevin Dickson in. Dickson is a member of the 2016, U-20 Asian Sevens champion Sri Lanka team. The two-day fist leg at King's Park is tipped to be a tough one.
The Hong Kong event will be the selection trial to filter the best two teams for the World Rugby Sevens Championship which is to be held in America next year.
The Asian strong hold Japan and host Hong Kong are determined to make a successful initiative in Hong Kong for their World Sevens campaign.
Sri Lanka will play in the Group 'B' along with Japan, South Korea and Chinese Taipei while Hong Kong, China, Philippine and Malaysia will battle in Group 'B'.
According to Muthuthanthri, Japan and Hong Kong are in fine form with lot of experience and will be the biggest challenge for us. Both countries played in the last Sevens World Cup and also played many international matches since then.
" It is sad that several our top players did not make the tour to Hong Kong, But I think our youngsters will prospect on this great opportunity to prove their talent and make the country proud," he concluded.
