It’s the Aluthgama - Bogamuwa Sanasa Society

Police spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekera making a clarification on the news item which stated that an accountant of Sansa Bank who had embezzled Rs. 22.9 million, had been arrested, said the name of the bank should be Aluthgama - Bogamuwa Sanasa Society in Gampaha and not the Sanasa Bank as mentioned in the press release sent earlier.
