Pivithuru Hela Urumaya to demolish "Hanuma bridge" if constructed

Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Leader Udaya Gammanpila said yesterday that if the bridge connecting Sri Lanka and India known as "Hanuma bridge" was constructed, they are ready to demolish it.
He stressed this point at a press conferenceat his party office in Pitakotte yesterday. Gammanpila also said the public opinion should be sought before constructing this bridge.
"Do not construct it out of fear for India. This bridge can change the ethnic ratio in the country. Many non communicable diseases will enter into our country through the bridge. The Indian Highways Minister said the Hanuma bridge will be constructed and USD 5.3 billion loan had been sought for the purpose. Minister Lakshman Kiriella refuted it in Parliament as a total lie. Direct Indian invasion is about to come. The Indian minister had made a statement in Hindi in Indian Parliament. I don't understand Hindi, but so far there had been no clarification in the newspapers with regard to his statement," he said.
