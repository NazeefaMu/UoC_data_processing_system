Pricing a war against smuggling

A little over two weeks ago, Customs officials arrested three persons at the Colombo International Airport for attempting to smuggle 70,000 sticks of illicit cigarettes into the country.
This seizure follows a similar incident in November last year when 36,600 sticks were seized at the airport, after two women were also nabbed carrying 80,000 sticks.
They were all travelling from Dubai and the value of this latest consignment of contraband caught at the airport was over Rs. 3.5 million. Besides the action at the airport, in January this year police have already conducted over 150 raids on illicit cigarettes island wide yielding 1,460,576 sticks valued at Rs. 73 million.
The numbers and the level of action are overwhelming, but we are only scraping the surface here. Annually, authorities confiscate over 100 million sticks smuggled into Sri Lanka worth over Rs. 4 billion. While Customs officials together with police are doing a commendable job with detections, estimates indicate that 200 million illicit sticks still make it to the market resulting in over Rs. 8 billion in losses to the government.There are of course other ways of access besides the regular ports of entry.
It is safe to assume that everyone everywhere is aware that no government in the world would let anyone walk-in to a country with 80,000 sticks of tobacco, so, why do it? It would at most be limited to five cartons which is 1,000 sticks.The driving force is price.
For international smugglers and even any unscrupulously enterprising individual, at Rs. 50 a stick Sri Lanka presents ample opportunity for profit when price of production, packaging and logistics will not set them back past Rs. 8 a stick.
The Middle East,Dubai, Turkey in particular,Malaysia and Eastern Europe are popular production hubs closer to Sri Lanka, producing counterfeit products replicating reputed global brands and some of their own.Using cheap tobacco leaf and unsafe production methods, these criminal elements reach a vast global base earning millions/billions of dollars illegally.
A KPMG study on the illegal cigarette trade published in 2015, points to a 7.3 per cent growth (30 billion sticks) in the illicit trade in 41 countries between 2008 and 2013, which amounts to over US$ 200 billion in uncollected taxes.
According to the report,in most countries a reduction in affordability of legal products was accompanied by an increase in illicit, whilst 14 countries that increased taxes but also invested significantly in counteracting illicit saw a reduction in consumption overall.
Therein lies the Sri Lankan predicament.To control and safeguard its populations against the ills of smoking, successive governments chose pricing as its panacea.But in doing so it also created a lucrative market and opportunity for tobacco smugglers. Have we invested enough effort and resources on countering the illicit trade? At our ports of entry, Sri Lanka Customs assures they keep a tight watch with a well-entrenched network to spot and nab offenders, and to their credit have reeled in impressive numbers at the harbor and international airport.
In 2015, Customs detected a container at the Colombo port with 4.4 million illegal sticks valued at over Rs.130 million, but can some get by. Reports also reach us of large scale smuggling via fishing boats in the straits off Jaffna and Mannar, and even the East Coast, with an unprecedented number of sticks reaching the local market.
In addition, the problem of illicit is not just imports.There lies a domestic element too. Beedi, while being a licensed product, is manufactured by a handful of producers in the country and enjoys the slimmest of tax margins. But Customs data point to 3.3 billion beedi sticks consumed in 2015 up from 2.2 billion the year before.
The spike in consumption is delivered not only by licensed manufacturers, but also a growing number of racketeers capitalising on Sri Lanka's increasing unaffordability of legal cigarettes. With cigarette prices rising 43% within a space of a month just last year, the beedi trade is poised for exponential growth, but with little or no gain for depleted government coffers.
The KPMG report quotes Adam Smith from The Wealth of Nations. “When the diminution of revenue is the effect of the encouragement given to smuggling, it may, perhaps, be remedied in two ways; either by diminishing the temptation to smuggle, or by increasing the difficulty of smuggling. The temptation to smuggle can be diminished only by the lowering of the tax; and the difficulty of smuggling can be increased only by establishing that system of administration which is most proper for preventing it.”
The Sri Lankan government's effort to control tobacco harm via pricing is laudable. But we must take adequate precautions to ensure that we don't give wings to criminal elements. Colombo is teeming with illicit. A mere walk down the streets of Fort, Mount Lavinia, Wellawatte, Nugegoda and Kirillapone gives consumers access to a multitude of products and brands that have escaped paying dues to government and are here via illegal means. Besides lost revenue, what troubles is the presence and reach of criminal elements feeding off the many loopholes that exist in our system, corrupting the fabric of society. Criminals breed criminals. Retailers presented with an extra Rs. 3 in margin will undoubtedly find selling illicit a lucrative option and therein stems the rot, as they then dive to hide their wares from authorities, plus, entice customers to buy and smoke illicit.
Pricing is a key facet to ensure controls alongside a planned and empowered approach by law enforcement authorities. Canada poses a good example on the impact of tax and pricing on smuggling. In 2011, the seizure of illicit cigarettes were still 1,560 per cent higher than the year 2000, the year before large tax rate increases were implemented. “The evidence to date is consistent with the notion that in order to curtail a large scale illicit trade problem, improved enforcement measures can make a substantial difference,” KPMG reports.
To combat illicit, governments need to revisit tax policies to ensure law and order, plus, achieve their health and revenue objectives. Combatting illicit may not necessarily result in reducing total consumption, but if we were to allow the uncontrolled growth of illicit markets it will certainly render further tax hikes irrelevant to policy objectives. Measures to improve enforcement should reduce expected profits earned from illegal trade and reduce the scale of the problem. This includes any measures that increase either the likelihood of criminals being caught or the penalties received when they are.
Smuggling is a global pandemic, and with Sri Lanka's rising prices due to a myriad of factors it has become and will continue to be a hotspot for criminal elements. This is by no means restricted to the tobacco trade, but it serves as ample example of the length and breadth of the global pandemic. It's here and very real in all parts of Sri Lanka,producing social and market impacts right down to the grassroots of this country. Enforcement is critical, and enforcement will be empowered further with the adoption of pragmatic pricing and social policy. We trust that governments will take good note.
