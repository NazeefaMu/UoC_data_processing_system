ACCJDENTAL LOVE

Clifford Richards has been in all the right places at the right time. Outstanding Personalities features Clifford Richards who believes that God’s grace and gift of music have done wonders for him.
Q. Clifford, you are a renowned entertainer, singer, compeer, and TV and Radio presenter. What set you on the path to stardom?
A. Since my school days, I have been singing and taken part in college musical activities and talent contests. Over the years my involvement grew. I was also involved in university activities such as organizing shows and being a part of shows. That is how it all started. Subsequently, I went into radio and then to TV. It has been a gradual journey.
It was not planned because I am an engineer by profession. Now I am involved in a family agriculture business. This was not planned either. When it comes to singing, over the years I have been doing it, but compeering was definitely by accident.
I have an interesting story to tell you about compeering. One day I went to sing at an event in Kandy. Suddenly they realized that there was no compeer. One of the organizers wanted me to play that part. They said I did it well! That was the start. Actually her name is Indrani Wijesundara. She is a pianist and a leader of a band called ‘Friends in Harmony’ of which I was also a part for some time. ‘Friends in Harmony’ play at weddings, parties and functions. I was there to sing, being a part of Friends in Harmony. But there was no compeer that day and she asked me whether I could do it. Reluctantly, I said yes. I was nervous and reluctant to do it because I was never a talkative person. I was a singing person! That is actually fate. It comes to you in strange ways. I believe that it is God’s plan. When I look back at my life, I am satisfied and I always thank God for all that he has given me. It has been a blessing. There is reason for everything.
Q. To be charming is a coveted ability. How did you develop your charm?
A. I didn’t develop my charm (laughs). This is who I am! I don’t put on anything. During my school days and also maybe campus days, I was a totally different person - very shy and not very outgoing. Suddenly that changed. Now this is the character you see. It is mysterious how that character suddenly changed. Now I am not shy at all. It is difficult to say how it happened. When I was at school, girls used to bully me! Now it is the other way around – I bully the g irls! I went to Trinity College, Kandy.
Q. How did you develop your charismatic and dynamic personality?
A. Well, I have not followed any personality developing courses or anything of the sort. It is God’s gift and I am using it to enhance my profession. I make the maximum use of my potential. The potential is within me. I have been fortunate that I have been at the correct place at the correct time. Only then, can you build on your potential. You meet the correct person at the correct time and you do your job well. Then things happen. Success depends on the opportunities you receive and how you make use of the opportunities.
Over the years I developed a liking to be a radio presenter. The former director of the Police band DIG Lancelot Perera was instrumental in introducing me to radio, giving me a lot of support. It was through him that I got the opportunity. Some people have the potential and the talent, but most of them are not discovered. They die a natural death and no one knows about them. To be identified is very important. You may have the talent but you need someone to identify you and hire you. Certain people come into your life at certain times and that sets you on the path.
 If you don’t have butterflies, then you are not human. Noeline, one of my teachers said that having butterflies in your stomach is natural, but you must teach them to fly in formation. Having butterflies is good, but if you let them go out of control, people will notice. Having butterflies is good because it keeps you conscious of your surroundings.
Q. Out of all your concerts, which one do you cherish the most and why?
A. I cherish all my concerts. Every concert is different from the previous one. This is because I have to change everything because it is more or less the same crowd that comes. I have done about eight concerts – Clifford Richards Live in Concert. Though it is ‘Clifford Richards Live in Concert’, I have dance troupes and duets. I have sung duets with Correen, Dalreen, Noeline, Mariazelle, Stephanie and Chathurika. Being with people like that on stage has been a great honour for me. They have been inspirational. It is a pleasure to work with people like that because they are legends.
Q. Have you reached the zenith of your career?
A. My bar is always increasing. There will always be something to look forward to. I always want to do the next event better. I want to test my limits. It is then that you know your true potential.
Q. Who has influenced you the most?
A. One person is my wife, Marcelle. She has been very supportive looking after the kids and taking care of their activities. We live in Kandy and I am mostly in Colombo. She has always been a very good critic. She always provides constructive criticism. That has helped me improve.
I don’t’ believe in good times and bad times or auspicious times. Every moment is God’s moment. You have to do everything with a good heart and good intention. The time you do something is immaterial.
Q. What is your message to the youth?
A. My message is to be yourself and not try to be someone else. See what you have inside you. Try to bring it out as much as possible. Listen to other people. Be open to criticism. Then you will realize how capable you are and you will do well.
Q. You are a singer. How did you refine and perfect your voice?
A. I am self-taught, but I remember going to Lylie Godridge for five or six months many years ago when I was schooling. I went to Maryanne David as well. Besides that, I have never gone through formal training. Of course I do a lot of physical exercise and have started yoga.
Q. Tell me about your involvement with yoga?
A. I started doing yoga. I have realized the best thing you can do for yourself is yoga. It will heal you and bring you a lot of relief mentally and physically. Your well- being is very important – mental and physical.
Q. Are you a spiritual person?
A. Of course. Like compeering, yoga is an accidental thing. I went to compeer a yoga conference by Anoja Weerasinghe. Until then I did not know much about yoga. I thought the slow motion thing does not work well for me. Listening to the people and doctors who spoke about the benefits of yoga, I decided I should do it. That is how I started. Yoga has nothing to do with religion. Yoga basically makes you a different person. It changes your attitude. It teaches you many things. Sometimes we believe we can change things and change people. When we can’t change a person, we get depressed. When someone is ageing you cannot change it. If you can’t stop yourself from ageing, how can you change someone else? That brings a lot of perspective to life.
It changes the way you look at things. It changes your attitude and changes you physically. Unfortunately, the media does not place enough emphasis on yoga – telling the people about its benefits. Because it comes from India, people associate it with Hinduism and Buddhism. But there is no connection to religion. In yoga, you have Asanas (different poses). Every Asana or pose has a positive impact on a particular organ in your body. When you do the shoulder stand, it stimulates the thyroid glands.
Q. When compeering, do you still have butterflies in your stomach?
A. If you don’t have butterflies, then you are not human. Noeline, one of my teachers said that having butterflies in your stomach is natural, but you must teach them to fly in formation. Having butterflies is good, but if you let them go out of control, people will notice. Having butterflies is good because it keeps you conscious of your surroundings.
Q. Who are your favourite singers globally?
A. Tom Jones, Elvis Presley and Engelbert. But mainly Tom Jones. I love his voice. He is really able to capture the audience. Your level of competency comes second. First comes how well people like you. You can be the best reporter or photographer or singer, but if people don’t like you, they won’t take you. If they like you, they will take you.
Q. What makes you get out of bed and do what you do?
A. It is the joy knowing you can bring a smile to someone’s face. It is rewarding knowing that you have made people enjoy the occasion. It is the job satisfaction, knowing that you have done something really well.
Q. What motivates you?
 
A. The motivation is definitely due to the grace of God which I believe will always sustain and strengthen me. My family’s support is also a blessing. Music to me, is a gift from God. God gives different people different gifts. You are supposed to polish it and make good use of it. If you do not make good use of it, the gifts you have been given will be withdrawn. You have been given something so that you make maximum use of it.
