Citizens' Mail

Sports Minister, translate your words into action
As a live active sportsman in field hockey for nearly 35 years, playing ‘B’ and ‘A’ division, having led two teams, the United Youngsters and the Colts, I appreciate your recent statements regarding, being too presumptuous and overweight.
We have had Olympic medalists who were humble in their achievements, and those who ran in Asian games, who have all faded away like old soldiers without being presumptuous.
Sri Lanka, being Sri Lanka, is the first in many things, the first to produce a pompous female athlete, who was given more than a hero’s welcome.
The politicians, dancing to her tune, gave her the impression that her achievement was the greatest for this country. She came out publicly and kept on cashing in on the slogan: “I am from a poor background and our staple food was only jak (kos mallun) and rice.” By this, she enhanced her popularity among the ordinary folk.
They donated a vehicle, a house and many other gifts. The Sports Minister went overseas to greet her and sprung so many stories, all at our expense. Later this minister was humiliated, claiming he went ‘out of line’. Mr Sports Minister, do not worry about the gallery remarks. This is expected from Sri Lanka, another first. Enforce your vision.
Yes sir, professional sports personalities whoever they are, must understand, without being told, that their physical fitness and appearance should be the priority, to inspire confidence. Unshaven beards, tinted hair grown to flutter in the wind, and show-off sunglasses and newfound caps and hats, and tattoos cannot improve the quality of the game. It only stirs the inner self, which can be a hindrance to the focus of the game. Sri Lanka has a conservative image. The representatives must just be that. They must stand tall, cut an impeccable image, a first step to winning. All these uncouth, ill-disciplined, factors are definitely contributory.
Players’ swollen-headedness and pomp steal the glamour from the game. It creates a physiological imbalance in their judgement. The juniors have a bad example to follow.
Come what may. Please set standards, not for cricketers alone, but to the entire sporting community who are funded by the state, and ensure that their expectations must be matched with performance.
