A 67-year-old woman who beat her 45-year old disabled daughter to death and then burnt her corpse was arrested by Gampola Police yesterday.
The victim was identified as 45-year-old Meri Nona, a resident of Datriwatta, Gampola. The suspect, Lori Nona, was arrested on suspicion of the murder. The mother and the daughter were living in a small house in Gampola area alone for sometime.
The daughter was disabled following a vaccination administered during her childhood and Lori Nona had look after her thereafter.
Police said the suspect had allegedly attacked the victim with a mamoty when she was in a bed. She had later dragged her off the bed and set fire to the body. Thereafter, the mother had lit two lamps on either side of the partially burned body and spent the overnight with it.
The next day, a visitor had come to the house and the suspect had told him that her daughter had died and nobody from the village had come so far. Then the visitor had informed the Grama Niladari in the area.
He had visited the house and informed Gampola Police in this regard. Gampola Police are investigating.
