Real-life couple who inspired ‘Beauty and the Beast’

As he waited at the altar for his beautiful bride, Petrus Gonsalvus was trembling with nerves. Like many 16th century grooms, he had never seen the woman he was about to wed and this sensitive French courtier had more reason than most to worry.
So when the chapel door creaked open, Petrus turned around to lock eyes with wife-to-be Catherine. What he saw in them must have broken his heart... a look of horror, panic and sheer revulsion.
Because she found herself staring into the face of what she viewed as a beast – a monster, a freak of nature, the mythical Wildman said to eat babies alive.
Catherine managed to control her terror and married this ugly “creature”, covered from head to toe in wolf-like hair. But even more remarkably, she saw past the exterior and fell in love with the brave man blighted by a cruel and misunderstood illness. They had seven children and lived happily ever after for 45 years.
Sound familiar? That’s because Petrus and Catherine inspired one of the most famous fairy tales, ‘Beauty and the Beast’.
French author Gabrielle-Suzanne de Villeneuve wrote La Belle et la Bête in 1740 and millions of youngsters will now watch Emma Watson and Dan Stevens breathe new life into the fable as the latest Disney adaptation hits cinemas.
But the real-life tale truly proves the story’s moral – beauty is only skin deep.
Hypertrichosis
Petrus was born Pedro Gonzalez in Tenerife in 1537, his face and body covered in thick hair that gave him the look of a mythical werewolf. We now know he had inherited condition hypertrichosis, or Ambras syndrome, which sparks thick hair growth all over the body.
The rare genetic mutation is also called “werewolf syndrome” and just 50 cases have been recorded since the Middle Ages – Petrus being the first.
Little is known of his family but his appearance sparked fear, fascination and superstitious theories in equal measure. He was seen as a monster “an unholy hermit of evil” – one of the Wildmen of the Woods, who stalked babies in the dead of night and ate them alive.
But freaks of nature were also seen as status symbols by royals and noblemen. So when Pedro was 10, he was captured and taken to France as a coronation gift for Henry II and his queen Catherine de Medici.
On his arrival, the king’s physicians and scholars poked and prodded him to see if he would roar. Instead, he stunned them by whispering his name. He was held in the dungeon for further “tests”.
The scholars reported the wildman was still a child and he showed no sign of aggression or magical powers. So Henry decided to conduct an experiment.
Pedro was allowed to keep his name but in Latin – Petrus Gonsalvus. He got fine clothes and an education fit for a nobleman’s son. Henry wanted to see if he could make a gentleman of the savage.
And after proving a quick learner by mastering three languages, he remained under the king’s protection, shown off to visitors and foreign nobles. Artists flocked from far and wide to paint him.
Marriage
Italian historian Roberto Zapperi, who has written a book on Petrus, says: “He was a nobleman. He dressed like one and held a position at court.
Someone who lived by these rules had to marry. The challenge was finding a woman prepared to marry a man who looked like an animal.”
In 1559, the king was killed in a jousting match.
He was succeeded by widow Catherine, who in 1573 decided to continue with his experiment by marrying off Petrus and breeding little ‘wildmen’.
She began hunting for a bride and wanted a woman strong enough to survive the shock of seeing Petrus at the altar but pretty enough to arouse the beast within the Beast. The Catherine she picked was the daughter of a court servant, whose surname remains unknown.
What happened on their wedding day is not known either and they probably spent the wedding night being spied on by the Queen’s doctors, keen to observe the Beast’s mating ritual and see if the Beauty survived it. But, to the amazement of the court, Catherine and Petrus settled into a happy married life.
Catherine then had two sons, Paolo and Ercole, who did not inherit their father’s condition.
International sensation
But the next two, Enrico and Orazio, did – and the Queen was delighted. The couple also had three girls – Maddalena, Francesca and Antoinetta – all of whom had hypertrichosis.
The family became an international sensation and was allowed to travel Europe to stay with other nobles. They settled in Spain under the patronage of the Duke of Parma.
Zapperi explains: “The situation was strange, they were neither captured nor free and got paid very well.” The Duke let Petrus run an estate near Parma – but then sent his hairy children away as gifts to fellow dukes. Antoinetta became a plaything for the Duke’s own mistress.
It was another cruel blow for gentle-hearted Petrus and his loyal wife. In their final lives, the couple finally found peace at Lake Bolsena in Capodimonte, Italy, on one of the Duke’s estates. They were treated as ordinary, respected citizens and it is known Petrus attended the christening of his grandson in 1617.
It is believed he died the following year, aged 81. Catherine’s death was recorded in 1623. But it seems the real-life fairy tale may not have had such a happy ending as the fictional ‘Beauty and the Beast’.
Petrus had proved a caring man, a loving husband and devoted father. But on his deathbed, he was denied the holy oil that anoints the forehead in the last rites.
It meant he could not be buried in sacred ground. Even at the end, Petrus was seen as an animal. Mirror
