Urea, pesticides claim more lives than the war

More people have died by the use of urea and pesticides than the number killed in the 30-year conflict. "Every year, nearly 15,000 people are dying due to kidney disease," said National Food Production Project Presidential Secretariat Chief Athureliya Rathna Thero. He said this while addressing a meeting held yesterday, at the Batticaloa District Secretariat.
It was presided over by Batticaloa Government Agent P.S.M. Charles on the theme 'Toxic Free Nation'—a programme that was initiated by the Presidential Secretariat for safe agriculture, and a healthy society and nation. He further said, "Water being polluted by chemicals leads to cancer. Boiling water in aluminum vessels is injurious. Even after harvesting, the urea used is present in the product and water. Sri Lanka is the only country that manufactures five tons of manure within two months, in the world.
In Trincomalee, by the use of organic liquor, we have increased manure production by 90 percent.
By the use of organic manure, and elimination of inorganic manure, we can build a healthy society."
