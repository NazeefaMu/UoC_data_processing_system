‘Nice to see you’ to unfold at the Black Cat café

The exhibition “Nice to see you” of the French photographer Cédric Gatillon will be held on August 15 to 25at Black Cat Café, 11, Wijerama Mawatha, Colombo 07. The exhibition is organised by the French Embassy and the Alliance Française de Kotte offering the opportunity to discover these incredible pictures at the Black Cat café.
Cedric Gatillon’s pictures are not landscapes, nor portraits. They keep their distance from traditional codes and academic rules. Cedric Gatillon wanted to capture the magic moment when the eye catches in a fraction of second the improbable and ephemeral action of the daily routine. It is not pictures of "decisive moments", but of moments of the life of ordinary men and women of Sri Lanka, in their everyday work and leisure time. The photographs of Cedric Gatillon are of a great formal unity and they empathise with the daily life in the country. The specificity of its approach is to respect the reality, to transmit its own vision of the peculiarities of this country, outside any political or symbolic message.
