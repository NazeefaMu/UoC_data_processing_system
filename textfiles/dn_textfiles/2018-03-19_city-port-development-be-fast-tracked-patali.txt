Development of the Colombo, Kurunegala Dambulla and Trincomalee cities will be fast tracked along with the Economic Development process encompassing the Trincoamlee and Colombo Harbours, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
He disclosed this when he called on the Most Ven. Tibbotuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Mahanayake Thera of the Malwatte Chapter at his temple in Kandy and received his blessings on March 18.
Ranawaka said all infrastructure facilities in these cities including water and electricity supplies will be improved in addition to the road networks and community habitats.
A special project to develop Kuruengala town will be launched with foreign finding. He said the Colombo City Development Programme too had been accelerated and the Port City would facilitate the development of the entire city. Minister Ranawaka’s light railway project had also been launched alongside the Colombo City Development project.
Speaking to the media after meeting the Mahanayake Thera, the minister said he would submit a comprehensive proposal which would provide a streamlined service to the people within 18 months.
He said he had also formulated a short term programme to improve the capacity of airport, harbour and electricity sectors.
The minister said he also hoped to implement a streamlined environmental friendly programme to protect people from floods, landslides and other disasters and resolve social problems.
Minister Ranawaka who observed that 1,417 protest campaigns had been held in the country in 2016 said this worked out to nearly four protest campaigns per day. He said a proper solution ought to be found to problems such as the SAITM issue.
Since inter-community issues should not be allowed to develop into clashes he would also submit a proposal to help diffuse communal tensions and rivalries in the country.
Consultant (Projects) Urban Development Authority former Provincial Council member Thushara Swarnatilleke was also associated with the Minister during the visit.
