‘SL needs to shift to manufacturing economy’

President's Counsel M.U.M. Ali Sabry said that migrant workers contributed the most to the state revenue, with the second and third-largest contributors being the garment industry and tea exports, respectively.
He was addressing a gathering at the 51st commemoration ceremony of D.A. Rajapaksa, which was held at the Tangalle Urban Council auditorium.
"We have left behind a manufacturing economy and moved to a service economy, and this has resulted in trade deficits," he said, adding that people had been plagued by a debt amounting to Rs.417,913. The country needed to shift back to a manufacturing economy.
Therefore, a proper vision was paramount for the country to move forward, Sabry said.
The education, health, and security sectors required improvements as well, he added.
