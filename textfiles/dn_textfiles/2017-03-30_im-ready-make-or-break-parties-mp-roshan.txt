I'm ready to make or break parties: MP Roshan

Polonnaruwa District UPFA Parliamentarian Roshan Ranasinghe said he is prepared to form political parties, break them up or leave them for the benefit of the motherland. What matters to him is the country and not political parties. There is no need to safeguard a party if the country's interests are at stake, he said.
Parliamentarian Ranasinghe was addressing journalists at a meeting at the Kingsbury Hotel, Colombo recently.
Ranasinghe said 55 parliamentarians in the Joint Opposition are engaged in a role for the welfare of the country and the future generation.
They would never betray the cause for the sake of positions, perks or any other self interest. The Joint Opposition would take decisions which would further strengthen it.
