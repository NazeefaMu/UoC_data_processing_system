[APPRECIATIONS - (08-05-2018)]

Captain Eranga Ratnayake
He was courageous
A decade has passed since the passing of Captain Eranga Indika Ratnayake. Born on March 27, 1983, he would have been 35 this year had he not made the supreme sacrifice for his motherland on April 30, 2008, at the age of 25. I thought it would be fitting to pen a tribute to a dear friend from my schooldays at Wesley College, Colombo, whose short but eventful life, made a lasting impression on many.
Indika, who joined Wesley in 1994 entering Grade 6 (into the ‘E class’ whose class teacher was Kanthi Nanayakkara), was my classmate from then up to Grade 11. Afterwards, we diverged into different A/L streams. He became a student of Commerce, while I pursued Arts. But the separation from classrooms had no real practical bearing in distancing our friendship.
Indika was best known by his batch mates in College as Podiman; a nickname that was indelibly affixed on him due to the stark resemblance he bore to a child character by that ‘tag’ who appeared on a few episodes of the then popular teledrama Doodaruwo. Many in College at that time thought that Indika was actually that child actor. The tag Podiman later morphed into Podde. And so, Podde he was to be to his batch mates and other schoolmates who knew him well.
His college career saw him become secretary of the Junior Buddhist Society, a member of the Sinhala debating team, an office-bearer in the Sinhala literary union, a rugby player in the under-14 team, taking part in athletics, being appointed House Captain, and also a college prefect. He also won the college prize for Sinhala debating (The Ranabahu Memorial Prize) while in Grade 12.
There was a certain boyish boisterousness that defined him. It was an inimitably signature facet of his character and demeanour; anyone who knew Podde from college days would vouch to my statement. He was equipped with a ‘motor mouth’, a sharp (and somewhat untamed) tongue, a notable ‘vocal prowess’ (that ensured its audibility reached all corners of the classroom), wittiness and an energetic spark of vivacity that seldom dimmed. He was a boy brimming with life and was capable of true and sincere caring.
Many are the incidents and stories that could be related to this colourful character and mischievous ways. Once, when he was short of money for a pair of shoes he had wanted to buy; he conspired with his bosom friend and classmate Udana Rahatungoda (at whose house on Stratford Avenue in Pamankada, Podde was a regular visitor), to cut down a comb of plantains from a tree that was in the garden of the latter’s aunt’s house that was a stone’s throw away and not, at that time, separated from the Rahatungoda residence’s compound by a boundary wall.The comb of plantains was cut down, but the two of them couldn’t secure a sale for it from any of the nearby boutiques. The price they sought was Rs. 300, if memory serves me correct. It was a high price for that time, I believe. It was a madcap idea spurred out of the spontaneity for boyish fun. Due to the lack of success in making a sale, the bounty was abandoned somewhere to ensure no evidence was traced back to the two culprits. However, the missing comb of plantains that were near-ripe, was missed by its owners later that evening and was assumed to be the work of common plantain thieves.
A testimony to Podde’s prowess to churn the classroom’s climate from calmness to a more ‘animated atmosphere’ with his boisterousness, was found in what was once said by one of the masters in the A/L Commerce section, Winsiri Fernando. Once when Podde’s mother met Winsiri on the parents’ day, he had said that Indika, being of the stature that he was, still managed to turn the class upside down and added that if by chance he had been of Botheju’s size, he would have turned the whole school upside down. The person who was the subject of comparison was our batch mate Lahiru Botheju, who is of colossal physique, standing over six feet and was a star school rugby player who captained Wesley and then pursued playing rugby at a club-level afterwards. As ironic as it may sound, it was a sight to see. The strapping Botheju was at times, the subject of Podde’s classroom jests, jovial pranks and taunts. There was no doubt about it; Podde was the life of the party.
Podde’s ambition was to join the Air Force, following the footsteps of his father and elder brother. But he fell two inches short (if I recall correctly) to meet the height requirement. Although the army was not his first choice, his sense of pride to be recruited into the army as an officer cadet, was true and genuine. Topping his batch at the Diyathalawa Military Academy, he won a training scholarship to the British Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst and the following year, he passed out of Diyathalawa, being commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant in the Sri Lanka Army Engineers’ Corps. The letters he wrote to me from Sandhurst are still in my possession, forming part of the tangible memory that remains of him.
In the army, Indika earned the respect of both rank and file for his hard work and conscientious valiance. He performed his duty when beckoned to serve in precarious operations such as the Silawathura Campaign and several others of note which posted him in the war front. And whenever possible, he made it a point to call his friends while in camp, facing the uncertainties of the war front.
He was by all standards, a remarkable officer and a gentleman who served with untiring effort and undiminished courage. He was committed to serving his motherland and kept true to the Wesley spirit which is evoked in our College song in the line; and for our dear land, we’d be men of grit and industry.
On his visits home, off duty, he always made it a point to meet up with his close friends from college. He knew deep down that he had to make the most of the time he had to spend with those that mattered to him the most due to the uncertainty of war.
He was last stationed at Vauniya, where he spent his final birthday in active service, turning 25 and being promoted to the rank of (full) Lieutenant that very day. When I called him, he said he got the best birthday present ever and told me of the news of his long-awaited promotion.
On his last visit home in April, 2008, he made it a point, as per custom, to meet up with a group of us and do a night out in the town. That was indeed, a night to remember to those of us who were with him. That was the last time I saw my friend whom I had known since our days in blue shorts at Wesley. Four days later on the April 30, Podde passed away, falling victim to a high-pressure antitank mine while on a clearance operation in Vauniya.
I could not help but wonder when the war ended in 2009, what it would have been like if Podde had still been with us? I have no doubt that thought would have reverberated in all who knew him.
As time passes and change sweeps the lives of his batch mates, how will Podde be remembered? Words and memories will honour him, but nothing will replace him; that is the truth of the matter.
And to those of us who remember him, he will remain a vibrant youth who will not age. May remembrance of him bring gladness to the hearts of those who cherished him and were cherished by him.
The supreme sacrifice he selflessly made for his motherland was not in vain.
May he attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana.

Asoka Palliyaguruge
Woman of many talents
On April 16, this year, our family lost one of its treasured members; Asoka Palliyaguruge was not only a warmhearted wife, mother and grandmother, but also a loyal and sincere friend.
She received her primary education at Ananda Sastralaya, Kotte and Carmel Convent, Kalmunai, prior to joining Vincent Girls’ High School, Batticaloa and later, Visaka Vidyalaya, Colombo 5. Asoka was a multi-talented student who was also fluent in all three official languages of the country.
Upon completion of her school education, Asoka proceeded to acquire a diploma in Management and subsequently, joined the Gal Oya Development Board as its first female receptionist. She was later promoted to translator; a post she retained for 17 years until she was appointed administrative officer.
Eventually, Asoka left the Gal Oya Development Board and joined the Mahaweli Authority in 1980 as its administrative officer/publication officer, before retiring eight years later.
Asoka Palliyaguruge also served as a senior counsellor at the Kandy General Hospital and the Maharagama Apeksha Hospital and was a volunteer counsellor at the Kandy Cancer Society branch as well. She later functioned as an English teacher at Gateway College, while writing poetry to newspapers.
Regardless of field or post, Asoka executed her duties with perseverance and integrity. Her remains were cremated on April 17 at the Mount Lavinia Cemetery, amongst a gathering of family, friends and colleagues. May she attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana.

Chandra Karunadasa
A faithful friend
We met for the first time in the so-called ‘heaven on earth’
This was the impression of the majority to start with
It was the world-renowned University of Ceylon
Where you were, sincere group of friends were not alone
All those warm and cheerful undergrad days
We shared at Sangamitta, will never fade away
You had a long-lasting and enduring bond
With friends who still have undying memories so fond
Your departure haunts all loved ones many a day
Time passes soon; being unaware it is the fifth death anniversary
She was calm, soft-spoken and friendly
Warm, well-mannered, with a smart personality
She had a scholarly academic career
With a wealth of knowledge in Buddhism so rare
Her creativity and imagination was a reflection
Of the writings she undertook with devotion
Articles on numerous topics won international fame
Those are the souvenirs that we have in your name
Kalutara Bodhiya was a sacred destination
Where she helped the underprivileged in English education
Soon they enjoyed unlimited gains
Because for good voluntary, service she spared no pains
They should remember with gratitude
Her commitment and generous attitude
She was a remarkable being, wonderful
Which her loved ones experienced in full
She had a happy family life in possession
With a caring husband dedicated to his profession
She took pleasure in participating as a dutiful wife
After his demise, tried to fulfil obligations of life
An affectionate mother to her children
Domiciled down under, performing a worthy service
In their lives, she placed the most vital role
Helping them to reach the highest goal
During sunset years, she was safe and sound
Passed away peacefully with the family around
Your sincerity and affection to us was such
I do miss you; you whose company I treasured so much
Friendship and goodwill in her noble heart
Are all the precious memories now left
In view of the sweet fragrance of the days gone by
This is a tribute for a beautiful life spent with a wide eye
Both here and in Sri Lanka, offerings are made to the Triple Gem
To bestow merit; wishing you the Supreme Bliss of Nirvana

K. Joseph Perera
Lover of music
It is with sorrow that I write these few words of appreciation on my father, Kurukulasooriya Joseph Mervyn Perera, who passed away 30 years ago on April 24, 1987.
He was born on April 19, 1931 and hailed from a respectable Catholic family in Moratuwa.
His sudden heart attack at a comparatively young age of 56, was a blow to us all. He was the eldest in a family of three children.
My father, who received his education at St. Sebastian’s College, Moratuwa, was qualified for the senior school certificate examination (English) in 1948. He attended St. Sebastian’s College, Moratuwa, from 1937 to 1948. After his school career, he joined the Colombo Port Commission as a clerk in 1950 and became the time-keeping officer of the Public Health Inspectors’ division in 1970. He was the senior TKC at the time of his death in 1987 and completed 36 years of service at this at this institution, which he considered to be his second home.
He married my mother Rita on January 15, 1959. They lived a happily-wedded life. My mother was always behind my father and looked after him until his untimely demise.
He was a loving father to me and my three brothers; late Ranjan, late Andrew and Sharma, my only sister Anne and our spouses. My father was also a lover of music; every evening, he would play the mouth organ and enjoy singing his favorite songs. Music was his life and forte.
He was kind to all, hated none and was similar to a child, even in his old age. He had great faith in God with whose blessing, he led a happy life.
He always tended to family matters, up to his last day, and we can only be happy that his end was peaceful. He celebrated is 56th birthday on April 19, 1987 and just five days later, said goodbye to all of us to be with the Lord. My father’s passing away 30 years ago, was sudden and unexpected; it saddened our hearts. But we rejoice as we are certain that he is with our Lord Almighty. Even though he is no more, he will always remain in our hearts.
I thank Jesus for giving us such a kind and loving father. I thank him for all that he had done for the five of us and our families.
May the soul of my dear father rest in peace!

S. L. M. Shafie Marikar
An ardent educationist
Former Zahira College (Colombo) Principal S. L. M. Shafie Marikkar peacefully passed away after a brief illness at the age of 82 years. His contributions to the education of the Muslim community of the country, was noteworthy.
Marikkar assumed duties at Zahira College in 1967 and for 15 years, instiled Islamic awareness, thought and discipline in all his students.
He followed in the footsteps of Dr. T. B. Jayah and A. M. A. Azeez in order to maintain the Islamic Identity of Muslim students.
We still remember vividly, Marhoom Shafie Marikkar during his weekly Monday assembly at the Gaffoor Hall, stressed the importance of religion first, education second and thirdly, sports. Aside from religion and culture, discipline was also a subject he focused on; it shaped us into the model citizens of society we are today.
During his time as principal, he made it compulsory for students to offer Luhar Salat with the congregation at the Maradana Jumma Mosque and all the hostellers, to offer prayers five times a day. Marikkar also joined in the prayer sessions to set an example to his students.
He efficiently executed all school affairs with the assistance of the Maradana Mosque Committee and philanthropist Marhoom Naleem Hajiar. The All Ceylon Tablighi Jamaat owes its gratitude to Marhoom Shafie Marikkar and the Maradana Mosque Committee for paving the way for Zahira College to hold the World Tablighi Ijtema in 1967, 1973, 1976 and 1979.
Marhoom Hazarath Jee Inamul Hassan and other foreign dignitaries were accommodated at the Zahira College hostels at the time.
My father, Marhoom M. L. M. Farook, who was the college chief librarian when Marikkar assumed duties as its principal, was closely-associated with him in the All Ceylon Muslim Educational Conference and during all college activities. Marhoom Marikkar spearheaded the All Ceylon Muslim Educational Conference and took keen interest in the affairs of Muslim schools countrywide. He would discuss the shortcomings faced by Muslim schools and would take necessary action to solve such issues with the relevant authorities from time to time.
He also received assistance from former Foreign Affairs and Higher Education Minister late A. C. S. Hameed and former Speaker late M. A. Bakeer Markar, who was an old boy of Zahira College, Colombo.
S. L. M. Shafie Marikar has left behind his only son Abdul Ahad; an engineer by profession.
Just a few days prior to his death, the Zahira College Old Boy’s Association (OBA) felicitated Marikkar at its re-union dinner which was held under the patronage of OBA President Fowzul Hameed on January 27, 2007.
In recognition of late Shafi Marikkar’s contribution to Muslim education in Sri Lanka, the All Ceylon Muslim Education Conference had made preparations to launch a book called Muslim Education in Sri Lanka; Thoughts and Contributions of Shafie Marikar at the Zahira College Gaffoor Hall on May 12 at 3.45 p.m. by former Zahira College Vice Principal A. M. Nahiya.
We also pray that Allah may grant him Jannathul Firdhouse for his dedication to Muslim education.
