'DeadPool 2': release preponed

The much anticipated ‘Deadpool 2’ will hit the theatres two weeks earlier than the scheduled date.
According to a report, the studio has shuffled the release dates for its slate of ‘X-Men’ films and moved ‘Deadpool 2’ to May 18 from June 1.
The film will open against horror film ‘Slender Man’, and the move leaves the June 1 date without a film opening.
‘Deadpool 2’ marks the return of the foul-mouthed superhero (Ryan Reynolds) with Josh Brolin playing Cable. The superhero sequel also stars ‘Atlanta’ breakout Zazie Beetz as the mutant mercenary Domino.
The studio has also announced that another ‘X-Men’ movie ‘New Mutants’ has been moved back by 10 months. The film stars Anya Taylor-Joy, Maisie Williams, and Charlie Heaton.
