Towards real rectification

Political parties have already focused their attention on the Presidential election of 2020 and the next general election. Implied is their conviction that a change in the executive presidential system is not possible, at least during the term of office of the present Government. (Better not believe those now rare promises about abolishing the executive presidency).
The mass media is used to promote various candidates that aspire to be the President of the Republic and some analysts go to the extent of comparing our local heroes even with celebrated and powerful world statesmen. And speaking of heroes anyone is a hero in Sri Lanka – war heroes (Rana Viru), expatriate heroes (Rata Viru), political heroes etc.
Even the recent disturbances in Kandy are forgotten or are being forgotten in the customary Sri Lankan manner. However, the apologetic mantram that a repetition of such events will not be repeated is still heard from official quarters. It is nothing new. We have heard the same mantram being repeated ever since the latter half of the 1960s. However, no tangible action has been taken except for incomplete measures implemented under compulsion from popular struggle or external influence. That is why seventy years after winning independence we are yet to establish a Sri Lankan identity or achieve national unity and harmony. These belated and inadequate reforms were extracted from the politicos in the manner of taking a reluctant dog to the waters for a bath.
Bribery commission
Take for example the hard-won 17th Amendment to the Constitution. It was kept in limbo for several years on technical grounds, unlike the 18th Amendment which was quickly implemented. The Bribery Commission established during the Chandrika presidency was made a toothless paper tiger by denying its human and physical resources. Even the 19th Amendment was weakened by the invasion of parliamentarians to the independent commissions negating the very concept of independence. Many a statute which sounds good on paper is otherwise in reality. The latter is true of the law of the land too which has double standards- one for the wealthy and powerful and another for the poor and humble.
The arrogance of power, as well as dictatorial traits of ruling parties or personalities, has often resulted in calamitous consequences of even well-meaning projects. The modified Nilwala project resulted in enhanced periodic flooding and even the inundation of the Matara town. The accelerated Mahaweli is supposed to be a cause of subsequent frequent landslides in the hill country.
The hasty implementation of the Kotmale project has denied the population of a vast region their life-sustaining water. The consequences of the Port City project would be seen only in the future for the scientists differ on its environmental effects just like their nemesis – the soothsayers.
There is universal agreement that the Yahapalana government has faltered and lost its way early in its tenure of office. What is required today is a real rectification programme that would bring relief to the people. Incumbent governments have often resorted to quick fixes prior to elections to reduce the cost of living problems of the masses but their lifespan was short.
What is needed is a long-term solution to provide a safety net to the vulnerable low-income population. The masses are often admonished by politicians, economists and bureaucrats to tighten their belts. But those who preach do not practice what they say. It is unfair to ask the masses to sacrifice when the austerity is not practised across the board when parliamentarians and the elite engage in self-indulgence and ostentation.
In India, Ministers use Ambassador Brand cars. In certain European countries, parliamentarians including Ministers use public transport to commute. The bicycle is the mode of MPs in certain developed countries to reach Parliament. In our country, the people’s representatives, even in lower representative bodies claim to have fragile spines needing SUVs with super shock absorbers.
Whatever rosy picture ruling politicians present, our economy is in bad shape. It is perennially in a debt trap and a balance of payment crisis. Foreign investment is only a trickle and savings are far too little. Actually, the country is in such a crisis that we need to put the economy on a state similar to that of a war footing. It is necessary to strike a mean between consumer need for supporting low-income groups with the need to develop national production. Any development that does not take into consideration the plight of the poor or that does not concern the human interests is both worthless and pregnant with ultimate destruction tough ultimate anarchy.
Economic experts and politicians should guarantee a minimum standard of living with food security to all citizens. The Prime Minister has been often speaking of the need to uplift the middle class. True. But we have a much needier segment of the population below that stratum. It is necessary to reduce the tax burden on the masses by reducing indirect taxes and taxing the rich and the super-rich. Waste and corruption, as well as extravagant expenditure, should be controlled. It is time to reduce the jumbo Cabinet to one-third of its present size, reduce the perks and privileges of MPs etc. and slash the expenditure on personal security of MPs, PC members etc. Central government leaders should entrust attendance at official functions and related duties to provincial and local politicians and public servants whether they be ceremonial openings of new utility projects or functions at places of religious worship. There is room to cut down on expensive receptions, foreign trips etc.
Infrastructure development
In order to give equal benefits to the producer and the consumer, the state should intervene to eliminate the middlemen who make huge profits at both ends.
The government should intervene to reduce the cost of transportation of agricultural produce, including that of plantations. In a situation, they exceed all reasonable limits the government should start services such as those once carried out successfully by the food department and the marketing department. Priority should also be given to infrastructure development such as warehouse complexes and fruit (and vegetable) preservation centres.
There is an alarming prevalence of malnutrition, especially among the rural and estate population and unless it is addressed we will be saddled with a crippled workforce and an excessive elderly population to look after.
A holistic attitude and a pragmatic approach to planning are the sine qua non in any rectification programme to avert a slide into an abyss. Playing pandu with the lives of the populace with forthcoming elections should be replaced by real good governance based on rule of law and modern democratic norms.
