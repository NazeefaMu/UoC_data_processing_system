Language proficiency for state officers

Sabaragamuwa Province Governor Marshal Perera said that language proficiency is among the key features for development of the state service.
He said so while presenting diploma certificates to state officers who followed the Tamil and English language proficiency diploma courses at the Training and Development Centre for Management at Pussella, Ratnapura, recently.
In line with the state language policy, English and Tamil language proficiency diploma programmes are conducted by the Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council for state officers serving in the Province with the aim of improving service while strengthening ethnic harmony. Each diploma programme which is being conducted for a year sees a huge demand from state officers. Of the large number of applicants, 48 officers were selected to follow the first such language diploma programmes.
