Infant dies after heart operation

Surgery beyond paediatrician's ken:
A two-month-old infant had died after being subjected to a hole-in-the-heart operation without the knowledge or observation of a Consultant Paediatrician, Karapitiya Teaching Hospital sources said.
The infant had been transferred to Karapitiya from Anuradhapura and died after the operation last week.
A high official of the hospital who claimed anonymity said a surgery of this nature is performed after stopping the heart and connecting the patient to a heart machine. The maximum time for using the heart machine was about an hour. This child had died because the infant had been connected to the heart machine for nearly three hours. The operation had been performed by a foreign surgeon of about 74 years with the assistance of a lady doctor without the knowledge of the Consultant Cardiologist of the hospital. Paediatric Cardiologist Dr. Mangala Gunatilleke said they had been informed about the admission of the child. But the surgery had been performed without his knowledge.
He was also not informed about a visiting surgeon handling the surgery. Hospital's Director Dr. Jayampathy Senanayake admitted that the child had died after the operation. But, nothing illegal had happened regarding the surgery, he said. The foreign surgeon was working with the approval of the Health Ministry.
