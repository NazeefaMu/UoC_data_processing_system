AG’s appeal against Gnanasara Thera, 12 others fixed for November 23

 
An appeal petition filed by the Attorney General challenging the Colombo High Court’s decision to acquit Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagodaatte Gnanasara Thera and 12 others accused from eleven charges including for attacking a church in Thalahena was yesterday postponed for November 23 by the Court of Appeal.
The Court of Appeal bench comprised Justice Deepali Wijesundara and Justice Achala Wengappuli.
The thirteen accused S. A. Athula Seneviratne, W.M. Sudu Banda, H.Thamara Beatrice, A.K. Denzil Premakumara, D.S.P. Kandana Arachchi, T.K. Somadasa, E.M.V. Ratnayake, K.W. Karunananda, E.M.H. Rathnayake, Ven. Aththaragama Gnanawimala Thera, Ven.Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera, Ven. Agulgalle Siri Jinananda Thera and Dhanushka Sanjeewa had been indicted in the Colombo High Court by the Attorney General for being members of an unlawful assembly to attack the Calvary church in Thalahena in 2008.
They were further accused for causing mischief to the said church and robbery of two golden chains worth Rs.15,000 and 50,000 belonging to person called Rohan Anderson and causing injuries to John Anton Anderson.
However, on April 2, 2014 the High Court had acquitted all the accused in the case.
Filing an appeal in the Court of Appeal, the Attorney General moved to set aside the judgment of the Colombo High Court and convict and sentence the accused according to law.
The Attorney General maintained that the High Court has failed to consider the police evidence and the evidence of prosecution and had not considered the explanation put forward by the prosecution witnesses regarding various shortcomings in their police statements.
Senior Counsel David Weeraratne and Kalyananda Thiranagama appeared for the accused respondents.
