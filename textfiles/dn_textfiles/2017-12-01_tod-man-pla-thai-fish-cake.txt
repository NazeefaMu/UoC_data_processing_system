Tod man pla (Thai Fish Cake)

INGREDIENTS:
*Minced fish (sea bass) 100gr
*Kaffir lime leaves 1gr
*Long bean 20gr
*Egg yolk 20gr
*Cucumber 10gr
*Peanut 5gr
*White sugar 3gr
*Fish sauce 5gr
*Sweet chilli sauce 30gr
*Red curry paste 40gr
*Sweet basil deep fried 5gr
METHOD:
1. Put the minced fish in a large mixing bowl. Add the egg yolk, red curry paste, fish sauce and a little bit of sugar to make it thick and sticky.
(You can also use a hand-held mixer or a heavy-duty stand mixer with the paddle attachment to mix the fish paste)
2. This should take about 30 minutes by hand or five to eight minutes on high with a machine.
3. When the paste becomes very sticky fold it in the kaffir lime leaves and sliced long bean.
4. Once the oil is hot, form ¼ inch-thick rounds from the fish paste with roughly two inches in diameter and gently slide them into the oil.
5. One side will be golden brown (after 30-40 seconds).
6. Serve the fish cakes with cucumber peanut and Sweet chilli sauce and deep fry sweet basil leaves for garnish.
