[APPRECIATIONS - (31-07-2017)]

Darshana Gurusinghe
A brilliant student
They say that the good die young. This saying couldn't have been more true, because death laid its hands on Prageeth Darshana Gurusinghe on June 30, 2005, at the very young age of 18. Eighteen is an exciting age in an individual’s life. Darshana, at that age, was indeed more than an ordinary teenager. He was tall, good-looking and talented. It was a tragic death that he was subjected to. On that unfortunate day, he had gone with five classmates for a sea bath. They got into difficulties and he and his good friend Gayan drowned.
Prageeth Darshana was an A/L mathematics student at Holy Cross College, Kalutara. Because of his seniority and his brilliance in studies, he was appointed a prefect of the College. He was also a brilliant sportsman. He passed his G.C.E. O/L examination well. Darshana was also known for his excellent handwriting. He earned a good name for his punctuality and hospitality.
During his school life, he participated in all competitions and brought fame to the school. His sudden demise was a great loss to the school, in addition to his family. He still leaves a permanent void in our hearts. He had only a few more months to complete his studies and sit for his final school examination. He was eagerly looking forward to obtaining a degree.
Darshana was my nephew, whom we visited every Christmas. In 2004, we could not visit him due to unavoidable circumstances. We always visit their family because they are near and dear to us.
He was a calm and sober boy. His parents were very dutiful and devoted to their two sons. Life without him is very strange and difficult.
The funeral oration was delivered by his uncle Rev. Bro. Nimal Gurusinghe F. S. C., the former cricket coach and master-in-charge of St. Sebastian’s College, Moratuwa. He delivered an eloquent sermon in which he said, “The Beautiful flower that God gave, he took back.”
Finally, I say thank you to Darshana for the way he brightened the lives of all of us.
I convey my heartfelt sympathies to his grieving father Bernard, mother Irangani and brother Udara and pray to the Almighty to comfort and succour them in their hour of grief.

Maya Senanayake
She epitomized human kindness
Maya Senanayake, who passed away peacefully on July 12, in the tenth decade of an exemplary life, dedicated to the upliftment and happiness of her fellow beings was truly the personification of the milk of human kindness.
Maya was the daughter of Hilda and P. de S. Kularatne, reputed educationists who were in the vanguard of the National Revivalist movement in the early years of the twentieth century. Married to the late Stanley Senanayake, who as the Inspector General of Police brought about significant reforms and infused new thinking to police administration in the seventies, she was the mother of four boys; Sanjiya, Saiiya, Athula and Mihindu, all of whom reached commendable heights in their respective chosen fields of activity. My deepest condolences go out to all of them and their families in their hour of grief.
I came to know Maya Senanayake on the February 12, 1958. Stanley Senanayake, as a Superintendent of Police, was the Director of the Police Training School (PTS). My batchmates were the late P. (Brute) Mahendran and E.S.R. (Cosmo) David. We had passed the examination for the selection of Asst. Superintendents of Police conducted by the Public Service Commission and this was our second day at the PTS. And it was on this same memorable day that the Director and his wife Maya entertained us to dinner.
Maya, with an outstanding university and parental background, endeared herself to the three of us with her erudition, humour, conversational ability and social etiquette.
Leaving the Director’s residence after dinner, I was convinced that life at the PTS would be filled with joy. In Maya, I had met a ‘lady’ in every sense of the word.
My assessment of this gracious woman became a reality when a decade later, as the wife of the Inspector General of Police, her innovative role in providing leadership to the wives of other senior officers in the improvement of the quality of life of police families by forming the Police Families Welfare Association (PFWA) was to have a profound impact on the lives of the lower ranks struggling to survive under the severe conditions of austerity prevalent at the time.
The significance of this pioneering effort of Maya becomes greater and more admirable in the backdrop of the fact that the official participation of wives in the improvement of the lot of public servants commenced only over a decade later, in the late seventies as the brainchild of the first lady of the time Elina Jayawardene. My guess is that the latter conceived the Seva Vanitha Movement inspired by the PFWA of Maya Senanayake.
Under her leadership, the PFWA gathered rapid momentum and within a short period became a noteworthy adjunct of the welfare set up of the Police. Because she was well-known, respected and accepted in the highest of social, business and government circles, she was able to run the affairs of this organisation with funds raised by her, without burdening the Police Department.
In the furtherance of the well being of the lower ranks she was instrumental in opening a tailoring unit to be run by the wives of police officers for the tailoring of police uniforms and also of school children. She was successful in getting the required number of sewing machines from the Singer Company on lease at a concessionary rate.
Welfare co-operatives were started at Police Headquarters and several other places eg. Maradana, Wellawatta and Moratuwa police stations. With the shortage of bread that prevailed, she made arrangements with the Marketing Department for the supply of freshly baked bread to Police Headquartersand several other centres. The pre-school she started together with the paediatric clinics she was able to initiate with the assistance of the late A. S. P. Ponnambalam were a boon to the children of police families.
It is tragic, indeed, that her successors were unable to sustain these remarkable welfare projects. Most of them could not match the learning, charisma, charm, leadership qualities and the natural ability to inspire that Maya possessed in abundance.
Out of the numerous facets of Maya’s illustrious life her pioneering role in the PFWA and the manner in which she cared for the refugees who sought protection in the PTS alone amply illustrate the sublime nature of the kindness and sympathetic understanding that she had been gifted with in abundance. Having been a direct witness to the above examples, I am happy that I have been able to recall and document these achievements of Maya with authority and feeling in appreciation of her life and work.
When the history of the Sri Lanka Police is updated some day, Maya Senanayake is bound to have a place of importance.

He was a dedicated patriarch
Though it has been 16 years since you left us, I must confess that I am at a loss for words when it comes to pen my appreciation of you. Thaththa, even after 16 years of the absence of your physical presence, I miss you deeply than words can say. It is with deep sense of gratitude and grief that I pen these few words of what he meant to me since he was my best friend, my guru and my precious father.
I am certain that the sentiments I felt are that which are felt by any child or adult who has ever lost a parent. As I try to bring myself to write this to pay tribute to him, we are now without both parents (as we lost amma 19 months ago) who had given so much to us. As such, this is my humble attempt in capturing the essence of a man whose presence I could never limit to words on a page. Over the past, I have not felt his absence because I realized that every day I continue life as his daughter, being true to all that he taught me in life, he continues to live.
We, your children, have great memories of your relationship with amma. Your family life was based on mutual understanding, companionship, absolute transparency, caring for each other and mutual trust. You appreciated amma for her contributions to bringing up the family, cooperated with her in her initiatives and placed your confidence in her as your wife and the mother of your children.
You appreciated us for what we were and trusted us to the extent that unknowingly, you built moral-binding in us to be always uncompromisingly truthful to ourselves and thereby never to break the trust of others. You taught us many lessons in life and we picked up these lessons and it is written in our hearts. Your love, appreciation, trust, among many things, molded us to be the people we are today.
Thaththa, you said learning was the foundation which no one can take away. We are what we are because of you and amma. You always told me to do my duty with dedication, commitment and integrity. This was but just one lesson that we repeatedly say. We grew up with your values and we are glad we did as it has proved beyond doubt what life can give. We note with gratitude to you, the positive comments of others of our ability to go through life with zest, responsibility and honesty.
Thaththa, I wish you were alive to share my success in whatever I do. I know you would have been so proud to see what a content person I am today all because of your guidance and advice. I miss your voice, but most of all, I miss you just being there. I will always hold on to the last conversation we had and how you never failed to let me know how much you loved me. Your spirit and what you have given us will always remain and make us better people for having had you as a great father.
The bond thaththa and I had, was unique. We enjoyed being together and I took an interest in whatever he did. You were my hero and I am deeply indebted to you for all the good things in life that you gave us. You gave us confidence to see through things. You taught us right from wrong. We thank you for many things you have done for us. Thaththa, I need you to guide me, to protect me and to love me the way you always have.
Thanks a million, thaththa, for being my father. Although, your demise has created a big void in our lives, you left us with sweet memories that we will cherish right through until we meet. No one can fill the emptiness I feel in my heart without your physical presence, but I know your spirit is with me and pray that you will always be with me.
With all these thoughts, I could truly say I am blessed to have had you as my father–the best and the sweetest the world has ever had. Thaththa, my world will never be the same without you, but as you had told me, we all need to move on with our lives. With much love and gratitude, we honour your memory.
As practising Buddhists, we are well aware of the impermanence of life, but to this day, I cannot believe that my father is not alive as his voice, firm advice and imposing figure still haunts me. He did his duty to the utmost and made us comfortable in every way.
Though not in extremes, he lived, accordingly to the Buddha’s preaching, with the least of wants and attachments. It is my sincere hope that his sansaric journey be shortened and he attains the supreme bliss of Nirvana with amma right by his side.
Daughter,
Damitha de Zoysa
Earle Samarasinghe
A principled man
My father Earle Samarasinghe passed away on 23rd July 2016, an year ago.
His demise was a great loss for my mother, my four sisters, their children and myself. He had a happy, healthy and accomplished life. He was also a principled man and always did what was right.
He also sought to inculcate these higher values to my sisters and myself and I think that we have lived by his high principles.
He was an International man, having worked for two and a half decades with UNESCO in Paris. He could mix and socialize with all types of people, regardless of nationality, culture or social class. His approach to life was rational and practical.
At a personal level, there could never be a better husband, a better father for my siblings, and a wonderful grandfather to his five grandchildren.
He enjoyed life very much and appreciated the good things in life.
My family, including my mother Charmaine, sisters Rapti, Gameela, Nira and Sumaya and their children and myself, miss him very much and will never forget him for all that he did for us and all those around him.

Sisira Fernando
A noble teacher
Dearest Sisira, today you are no more, although your priceless and yeoman mission of 25 years as a teacher will remain evergreen in every corner of St. Joseph's College, Colombo 10. Your smile bore no end.
Being a commerce special graduate, he imparted his knowledge to students frequently.
Not only that, he was a amicable father of two daughters and one son. He had a great and noble nature of connecting with every social status and every person.
I always admire how you practiced your religion.
He liked learning from different people, irrespective of their age, creed, nationality or caste. My memories of his halcyon days could never be forgotten.
By proving the saying 'every good thing comes to an end,' death's hand took him away from us so suddenly.
Life is mostly froth and bubble,
Two things stand like stone.
Kindness in another's trouble,
Courage in your own.
May he rest in peace.
Malintha Bopearatchy
