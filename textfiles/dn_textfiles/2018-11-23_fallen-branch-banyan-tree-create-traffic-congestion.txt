A fallen branch of a banyan tree create a traffic congestion

A fallen branch of a banyan tree created a traffic congestion on the Talawakele - Nuwara-Eliya road yesterday at 5.00 am, at Malli Appuwa. The branch had destroyed a utility pole and hence, disrupted power supply to nearby areas. The branch was later removed by Talawakele and Lindula Police.
