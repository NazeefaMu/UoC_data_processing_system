What David Foster Wallace ate

The writer David Foster Wallace (1962–2008) didn’t really eat food. When I met him, in 1996, when I was twenty-three years old, I really couldn’t cook, though it wouldn’t have occurred to me to consider this something we had in common. Wallace, who died by suicide on September 12, 2008, ten years ago today, burst into fame in the late eighties with experimental metafictions that took on the modern junk culture of advertising, celebrity, addiction, and alienation through technology. He struggled with those entities himself and was famous among his acquaintances for living mainly on packaged foods.
Every Love Story Is a Ghost Story, the excellent Wallace biography by D.<U+2009>T. Max, is littered with information like “he lived on chocolate pop tarts and soda” and “he had a love of showering, Diet Dr Pepper and blondies” and “there were only blondies and mustard in the fridge.” In 1995, the journalist David Streitfeld saw a kitchen with little more in it than a case of Dinty Moore beef stew and elicited the confidence from Wallace that “what’s really sick is I like to eat it cold.”
English muffin
For my part, I was a noncook to such an extent that my boyfriend, fed up with making meals for me, once angrily coached me through making him a dish he called toaster-oven pizza. This involved an English muffin, a bag of grated cheese, and a jar of red sauce. I made it, but I thought he was being completely unreasonable.
What I was mostly interested in back then was books and writing about them. I met Wallace because I’d transformed my dubious qualification of having read the advance proof of Infinite Jest twice into the opportunity to interview him during the book’s publicity tour. The interview ran on Stim, a newfangled kind of publication that in 1996 we called an “online magazine”. (That interview is still available online as part of the Wallace minor arcana and was just republished in August in an updated edition of Melville House’s The Last Interview series.)
The writer crush I developed on Wallace had come to me full blown when, one night reading alone in my first New York apartment, anxious and probably hungover, I sobbed my way through the end of “Westward the Course of Empire Takes its Way,” the last story in the 1989 collection The Girl With Curious Hair. “Westward,” seen today with the jaundiced eye of adulthood, is a creaky metafiction about students in a fiction-writing class, whose plot, to the extent it has one, is about a road trip to a McDonalds ad-campaign reunion. The main character is Mark Nechtr, a sweet Midwestern boy fiction writer who is addicted to eating fried roses. Nechtr’s foil is a clever postmodernist girlfriend, who commits fictional suicide in the end (meta, complicated, story-within-a-story). Wallace later repudiated the story as “a horror show … a permanent migraine … crude and naive and pretentious,” but there was also a time when he felt it was the best thing he’d ever written. Max says that upon the story’s publication Wallace felt it was what he “had been born to write” and that it “said all he had to say.”
Hilarious in retrospect
That anyone could cry over “Westward” is hilarious in retrospect, but truly, I did cry. The demographic of “young women seriously upset by postmodernism” must be vanishingly small, but in the midnineties, it described me. I’d gone off to college with the squeaky overachiever’s excitement to discover the meaning of life (and then, you know, apply it to what came next). To my dismay, no matter what the subject was, its underpinnings were in French critical theory, which I understood to be a poised intellectual valueless-ness and destruction of meaning. This was embarrassing, and not the kind of thing one admitted to one’s friends majoring in semiotics, but it clouded my college experience in secret but real ways. Wallace, in “Westward,” seemed to get it. A bit of beautiful doggerel from the story, critiquing the seminal postmodern story collection, Lost in the Funhouse, by John Barth, has run through my head for the past 22 years.
Barth’s funhouse metaphor points to the infinite regression of the narrative viewpoint in fiction—even if you reveal the meta-story behind the story, you’re just adding another fallible and relative layer. None of it is real. On the contrary, Nechtr, the Wallace stand-in, “desires, some distant hard-earned day, to write something that stabs you in the heart. - Paris Review
