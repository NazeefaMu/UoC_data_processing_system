JO spreading rumours to destabilise government: Mujibur

The Joint Opposition is trying to incite an ‘army coup’ by spreading rumours that the government is on a witch-hunt against the war heroes, UNP backbenchers complained yesterday.
Addressing a press conference at Sirikotha, UNP MPs Mujibur Rahman and Wijayapala Hettiarachchi said the Joint Opposition is engaged in a conspiracy to turn the country’s armed forces against the government through provocations.
They said the series of protests in and around Colombo is an organised attempt by the JO to sabotage the Government’s work. “We observe the protests blocking the main roads have become a trend. Daily there is a protest at Fort obstructing the routine activities of the commercial hub. These protests have negative impact on the country’s economy. We understand that defeated political elements are behind instigating these protests,” MP Rahman said.
“In the past, the street protests were the last resort when problems could not be resolved through negotiation. However, today the government is unaware of the existence of such a problem as they have not attempted to discuss it prior to protesting,” he said.
He stressed that the government would be forced to take stern decisions to control these protests, if the trend continues unabated.
“The Joint Opposition tries to create an impression among the military and general public that this government is against the war heroes. This is clearly a politically motivated stance. They know they cannot grab power through elections. They have no alternative solutions to the problems the country is facing. Therefore they simply try to sabotage all the government’s work,” he said.
Commenting on the shooting incident in Kalutara yesterday targeting a prison bus, MP Rahman said the government should take stern action to cripple the activities of the underworld. “The suspects should be identified and brought to book,” he said.
