zMessenger, SSD-Tech partnership to pave way for concrete initiatives in mobile arena

zMessenger, the country’s largest mobile marketing solutions provider and winner of multiple awards recently embarked on a partnership with SSD-Tech, a leading technology company based in Bangladesh. The agreement would emphasize zMessenger’s regional expansion with regards to leveraging on the potential market opportunities in Bangladesh.
A partnership agreement was recently signed between the two organizations with the aim of conducting mutual knowledge exchange. SSD Tech Chairman, CEO Matin Mahbubul was in the country to confirm the agreement along with zMessenger Co-Founder, CEO, Jayomi Lokuliyana. Below are excerpts from an interview conducted.
Q: Can you explain to us how this agreement came to be finalized with SSD-Tech in Bangladesh?
Jayomi – First of all I would like to thank the officials from SSD-Tech who came down to acknowledge this partnership with us. We conducted an analysis of current influential tech organizations in Bangladesh and SSD-Tech of course, was placed on top. SSD-Tech have been considered as veterans and strong players in the Bangladeshi market and also acquire a strong product portfolio. We recognized strong innovative synergies that can be leveraged in the process and so we approached them and conducted discussions to validate this relationship.
We decided to expand our services with Bangladesh due to the proximity region-wise and of course, considering the growth that is evident today in Asia, we felt that Bangladesh was a good place to commence our expansion with. zMessenger has envisioned expansion growth this year and this happens to be our second partnership, with Japan being our first. Many companies tend to look to the West for such expansions but we need to realize that such opportunities are also closer to home.
Q: Can you disclose SSD-Tech’s initial outlook towards engaging with zMessenger and Sri Lanka in general?
Mahbubul – SSD-Tech is a $65 million Company that has been around for over a decade. We are a Bangladesh-based multinational technology company, SSD-Tech. We have always considered working with Sri Lanka and conducting mutual services exchange and after having found zMessenger as being an ideal local partner. Both companies had been instigated around the same time period in this industry. We had considered Sri Lanka for a while now and we believe that this partnership has been a timely initiative.
In the process we found many pieces of intellectual properties which can be mutually exchanged amongst each other. We also found that zMessenger acquires a number of outstanding products that would prove influential to the Bangladesh market. We also look forward to expand our footprint in Sri Lanka as well through a win-win situation.
Q: In what way will both organizations come forth with relevant implementation in the field?
Jayomi – zMessenger acquires capabilities that will increase our digital marketing asset base as a result of this partnership. We are strongly into digital marketing and value added services with 14 years experience in this field.
We have products that fall under categories such as education an entertainment and look forward to launch these in the near future. Considering that Bangladesh is a country that is eight times bigger than Sri Lanka, we anticipate learning curves along the way and a great platform for zMessenger to delve into.
With our array of value added services, we need to bring these elements into the markets.
Mahbubul -We are glad to have partnered with Sri Lanka and I believe that Bangladesh can relate with this country in many ways.
We have cultural similarities as well and this also helps to form a conducive environment for business relations. SSD-Tech is already present in Myanmar, Malaysia and Singapore. Sri Lanka is an exciting market with immense potential in the traditional mobile arena and we believe our alliance will help bring about an innovative and positive impact to the telecom market for both countries thorough the introduction of concrete initiatives in the mobile arena.
