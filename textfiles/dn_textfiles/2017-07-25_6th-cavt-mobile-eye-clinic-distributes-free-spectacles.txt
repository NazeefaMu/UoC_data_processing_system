The Centre for Army Vocational Training (CAVT) at Saliyawewa, launched its 6th mobile eye clinic project with the support of Kandy Opticians (Pvt) Ltd at Warawewa Siddartha welfare community hall.
Two hundred and eighty four pairs of spectacles were distributed among the underprivileged people, suffering from vision impairments.
The mobile clinic, organised on the instructions of CAVT Commandant Brigadier H.E.M.R.B.T. Hathnagoda, got underway on Monday (17), after the CAVT observed the need for many more civilians in the area to undergo such vision examinations.
Dr. Nimal Weerakoon of Kandy Opticians (Pvt) Ltd, together with a team of medical staff conducted this mobile eye clinic where those pairs of spectacles were distributed after screening more than 400 civilians in the area.
