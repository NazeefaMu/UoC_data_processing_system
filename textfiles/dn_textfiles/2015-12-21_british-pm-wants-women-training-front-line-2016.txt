British PM wants women training for front line in 2016

UK: British Prime Minister David Cameron told The Sunday Telegraph newspaper he wanted to see female British soldiers training to fight on the front line in 2016.
Cameron has asked the Ministry of Defence to be ready to post women in ground close-combat roles by the end of next year, after Washington announced this month its military will open all positions -- including frontline combat roles -- to women.
“The Defence Secretary (Michael Fallon) and I are united in wanting to see all roles in our armed forces opened up to women in 2016,” Cameron said. “We’ve already lifted a number of barriers in our armed forces with the introduction of female submariners and women reaching the highest ranks in all services.
“We should finish the job next year and open up ground combat roles to women.”
Female troops make up around 10 percent of Britain’s armed forces.
Women are currently banned from ground combat units “where the primary role is to close with and kill the enemy”.
A review found “no compelling evidence to prove women impair effectiveness in close combat situations”, Fallon said.
