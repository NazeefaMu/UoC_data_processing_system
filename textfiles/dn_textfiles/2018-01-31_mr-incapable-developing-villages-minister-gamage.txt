MR incapable of developing villages: Minister Gamage

Since former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is currently seeking a mandate for the SLPP to rebuild villages, people should ask him what he had done for the village sector during his 10-year tenure of office, when he comes seeking their votes, Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage said.
Addressing a series of UNP local government election rallies at Mahaoya in Ampara, Minister Gamage said during the Rajapaksa regime, edifices such as an airport, harbour, and an international conference hall had been built in Hambantota with an eye on commissions, which had turned to be white elephants increasing the country’s debt burden. As such, Rajapaksa would be incapable of developing villages, even if he was entrusted with power again.
He said the oppression caused during the Rajapaksa regime by attacks on Chilaw fishermen and Rathupaswala residents who held peaceful demonstrations, seeking solutions to their urgent problems, were fresh in people’s minds.
The Yahapalana government had already rendered a great service towards the development of villages, even without any power in the local government institutions. The people, therefore, should return power to the UNP at the local government institutions to ensure better service to the rural sector, the minister said.
