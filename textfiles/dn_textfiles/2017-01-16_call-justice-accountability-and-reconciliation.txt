Call for Justice, accountability and reconciliation

The Consultation Task Force was formally appointed in February 2016, and began receiving submissions in April 2016 on the proposed mechanisms outlined in Human Rights Council Resolution 30/1, in which the government promised to deliver justice, accountability, and reconciliation in the aftermath of Sri Lanka's long civil war.
The piece today looks at views of persons who went before the task force. The Report is in two Volumes with a Summary edition with observations on four mechanisms-Offices on Missing Persons, Office of Reparations, Truth, Justice, Reconciliation and Non Recurrence Commissions and a Judicial Mechanism comprising of a Special Court and Office of a Special Counsel.
The Report recommends - continuous communication on transitional justice. Many had expressed bitterness, anger and frustration over another initiative with others warning it could deepen wounds, open new ones and exacerbate ethnic and religious tensions.
International involvement was rejected by security forces representation and support for current initiatives and restorative as opposed to retributive justice with involvement of spiritual leaders. They prioritized reconciliation and reparations to prevent non recurrence, constitutional reform and information sharing with their personnel to dispel doubts and miscommunication.
Lack of solidarity and support
The Army representative had bemoaned the lack of solidarity and support for a task they accomplished under difficult circumstances. Support for truth seeking, prosecution if guilt is identified, since their view was no criminal activity had taken place, insisting no deliberate targeting of civilians with zero civilian casualty policy whilst repudiating sexual violence as a weapon of war. Echoed by the Air Force adding no illegal weapons were used.
The presence of impunity was identified as a key impediment to reconciliation and an end to it preceding establishment of the mechanisms.
Pivotal needs
Political and constitutional settlement was another pivotal identified need.
Restorative psycho-social support for civilians and combatants across the ethnic divide.
Call for balanced youth and gender representation. Address inter ethnic land disputes.
Only a very few noted the need for a separate office of reparation.
Calls for interim reparation to meet immediate needs of employment for vulnerable members of families of the killed or disappeared and one- off reparation in kind in the form of educational scholarships for their children.
Calls for spaces for memorialistaion, official acknowledgement and apologies.
Restoration of burial plots to family members. Reparation connected to truth and justice. Documenting and archiving history.
Establishing the truth
A majority of submission for Truth, Justice, Reconciliation and non recurrence had sought the establishing of truth, determine root causes, holding perpetrators to account, build multiple narratives of history, enable victims to seek redress for violations and abuses. Build on existing work, implement recommendations and follow through with concrete actions.
Broad time frame spanning insurrections of the South and The North and East with greater inclusion of affected individuals. A call to make public reports received in all three languages.
The prosecutorial policy, treatment of emplematic cases and fate of emaling cases was not sufficiently addressed. Branches of the courts in provinces allowed to access in the language of their choice.Specific victim friendly procedures for treatment of victims and witnesses. Establishment of a Minority Rights Commission.
Observations
On the whole the coverage is balanced. What would have added value is deeper conversations with those who fought the war on the ground for the Government, families of the MIA and the disabled of the armed forces. Narratives largely missing in processes to-date. Similarly from Sri Lankans currently overseas.
The reports correctly call for inclusion of coverage of past commissions which straddle events in the North and South due insurrections and corresponding quelling of the dissenters. Related and valuable is the call to implement accompanying recommendations from the past which automatically addresses the issue of impunity the result of ignoring recommendations of past commissions.
Reconciling narratives before past Presidential Commissions including more recently the LLRC and the Paranagama Commissions and those made to the UN are also important. One of which remains away from public scrutiny. i.e. submissions and information gathered by the Darusman advisory committee to the then UNSG.
We already have a long established policy and practice of reparation since 1983 with specific criteria.
An invaluable set of recommendation which translates into a policy of affirmative action responding to the call for one off reparation was made in the interim report to the current President by the Paranagama Commission and accepted. It addresses in detail Trauma Counseling, dealing with the loss of breadwinner in the family, options for Income Generation access to Educational Needs, Health and Housing needs, Issues related to Property Rights, Lack/Loss of Documents due to war, Disability, Women Headed Households, Lost children and children with special needs and those abusing substances.
Criminal justice system
Unfortunately the members of past commissions, those who assisted them, the present members of the Consultation Task Force, commentators including this writer with two other who authored the Third Narrative have been branded as colluders, agents, friends of various political leaders or rent seekers at different times of our history. This game of discrediting at times of thankless public service is a national past time.
In the process, a very valuable work is thrown aside haphazardly. Same is true of analytical work including on law produced at great expense and time cast aside depending on the flavor of the period, replicated with Policy initiatives.
The Report notes a lack of clarity in prosecutorial policy which will generate debate given current practices in our criminal justice system complicated by the fact past commissions would have adopted varying methods to arrive at conclusions on validity of complaints and degree of proof in determining evidence was sufficient to warrant prosecution as they have done in their reports.
The UN CoI had its own criteria in making pronouncements on Sri Lanka before the Human Rights Council.
The Armed forces have had their own Boards of Inquiry. Some cases have already been heard before our Courts. A very vexed set of issues.
