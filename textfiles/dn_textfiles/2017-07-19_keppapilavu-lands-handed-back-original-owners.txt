Keppapilavu lands handed back to original owners

Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Minister D. M. Swaminathan, said the government has taken a decision to give back 189 acres of land of Keppapilavu village in the Mullaitivu District.
As problems arose on several occasions on giving back the lands at Keppapilavu village, Minister Swaminathan said the problem was solved after several special meetings held with the President, Prime Minister, State Minister of Defence and officials of the security forces.
An Army camp was set up in that area by the security forces and they needed provisions to relocate it. Therefore, to release the land immediately, the Ministry of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs granted a provision of Rs.05 million to the Army Headquarters. With the conclusion of the relocation of the Army camp, the relevant 189 acres of land was released to be given to their original owners today by Minister Swaminathan.
The minister further stated that 279 acres of land at Keppapilavu was given to their original owners on a previous occasion.
