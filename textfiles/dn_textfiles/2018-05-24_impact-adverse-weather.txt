Impact of adverse weather

The prevailing adverse weather in the island has claimed 11 lives and made thousands displaced in 12 districts. It is unavoidable for Sri Lanka to get affected by natural disasters especially by monsoonal rains due to its geographical location in the Indian Ocean. Sri Lankans have both wet and dry weather in line with climatic and monsoonal changes but the cost of these natural disasters are unbearable and indigestible because of our economic conditions of our country.
When our country faces massive disaster and destruction, we must stretch our helping hands to the victims of the disaster. It is our duty to provide humanitarian assistance to the victims regardless of their race, caste or creed.
Relief for flood victims
The President, as well as the Prime Minister has directed the representatives to provide swift relief with essential needs of the people.
The residents settled down on either side of the banks of Kelani, Kalu, Gin and Nilwala rivers and other disaster-prone areas should be vigilant. They must take precautionary measures to avoid any major effects and take prompt action to save their precious lives and property. In the meantime, the people in the temporary shelters should also take care of their basic hygiene and sanitary. There is a possibility to spread infectious diseases along with the inclement weather.
The disaster management authorities can provide the victims with instant dry rations or cooked meals instead of essential food items. The government can also identify the highly-risky areas in the upcountry which will potentially be affected by landslides and other disasters. The residents of such areas should be immediately evacuated and placed in the safe temporary shelters in order to avert major devastations. The philanthropists willing to extend their support and assistance can consider the infants and supply them with milk powder and drinking water.
Illegal constructions
The general public should not think that this is the responsibility confined to the government. We should also treat people with sympathy and empathy. We must treat others just the way we wish to be treated. Suppose if we have to face the current disaster ourselves what will happen to us? Thus think about our fellow citizens who are suffering from many hardships with their children and extend your generous assistance to intricate from the natural disaster.
On the one hand, the people become a contributory factor to make major floods in the urban and main cities in the country. We block the spaces through which the rain waters drain by illegally erecting buildings and shops and then no place for water to drain by which the water gets stagnated at one place and ultimately the particular place will get inundated with major floods.
On the other hand, the government, municipality, Urban Councils and Pradeshiya Sabhas should take immediate and severe actions against illegal builders and trespassers who illegally dominate and make their own shops and residents.
The Sri Lankans have the nature that we never prevent or take action against before something occurs, on the contrary, we worry and be harsh with people after something happened. This is not good for an ideal people or country, we should have a proper mechanism on which people can erect their buildings otherwise a proper action should be taken against the selfish and illegal intruders to avoid unwanted flooding in the major cities.
Moreover, we are formally an agriculture-based economic country. Our forefathers also came through this path. Our ancient kings and rulers have built massive tanks and reservoirs to save the rainwater that we obtain from the monsoonal rains every year for paddy cultivations.
Tanks and reservoirs
This concept has been forgotten by many people because we just allow a massive amount of water to flow into the sea today. We can just refresh our memory by recalling the verses of King Parakramabahu who said: “I will not allow a drop of water to the sea that we gain from the sky”.
This is indeed inspiring and thought-provoking verse that will encourage us to renovate or rebuild the tanks and reservoirs all over the island for the reason Sri Lanka does not get rain throughout the year. We have to save maximum water during the rainy seasons and use it for the rest of the period when we do not get much raining.
Of course, another sole purpose to generate electricity we need water and very often we dismay about potential power cut due to continuous dry climate. Hence taking this disaster situation as an example the political leaders should have pragmatic mission and vision to make a prosperous and potential country by which we should make a sustainable future for our offsprings.
