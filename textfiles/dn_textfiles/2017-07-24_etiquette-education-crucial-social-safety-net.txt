Etiquette education: crucial social safety-net

Teachers certainly have an imperative role in shaping their students’ future. In today’s schooling system, there is a strong focus on the three R’s, - ‘Reading, Riting and Rithmatic’ - but mentors must consider tagging on an E to the curriculum - Etiquette.
Etiquette lessons help children learn the difference between right and wrong, by helping them focus on their actions. Besides it teaches them how to interact with others. The purpose is to provide students the opportunity to develop life skills that go beyond academics into areas of character, leadership, sense and civility. Modern etiquette lessons should challenge students to recognise that social skills build character and are essential in developing positive, successful relationships - wherever they go, whatever they do, whoever they meet.
Clear and proper thinking
Today’s schools are already aware of the importance of pupils being all-rounders with success in academia, sports and the arts. This has meant that manners have in some cases gradually been left by the wayside in favour of a dazzling CV. It is all too true that school staff have such a huge workload, that it’s a bridge too far to expect them to administer perfect manners, too. For educators the task of instilling character development in their students isn’t just child’s play. It is not on the curriculum of any school but should be a subject that is as crucially important as mathematical and literacy skills.
Teaching children to make intelligent choices will help them become considerate individuals who will be admired for their character and ethical behaviour. Clear and proper thinking will to a great extent help reduce future problems they may develop or encounter. Still teaching such a subject entails a delicate balancing act and makes it all the more reason for school authorities to provide encouragement and guidance to teachers.
The value of teaching character education from an early age cannot ever be overlooked. The objective of character education is to fashion and nurture emotionally balanced, socially empathetic and caring individuals with a solid system of values. Its goal is to eventually raise mindful adults with socially acceptable ethics who are capable of steering a course through the challenges of life without compromising their principles.
The fact is, etiquette, or the lack of it, can have a significant impact on our educational and career prospects in several ways. But what exactly is etiquette and how does one define it? There are many ways to define etiquette but put simply, etiquette primarily relates to the way you present and carry yourself. That is why it is particularly important for students and young professionals beginning their careers to learn the subject.
Good role models
Etiquette, includes the way you dress, converse and handle yourself in a multiplicity of situations. It also influences that important first impression. First impressions do matter when it comes to communicating personality through appearance. Everyone has heard the old axiom that first impressions are lasting impressions. As a general guideline we have about nine seconds to make that impression.
As it correlates to everyday life, those nine seconds can often mean the difference between getting your scholarship, your dream job or not, securing financing for a new venture or not, or whether you decide to do business with a company or not. In other words it can be the cause of failure or success.
Unfortunately today’s culture sets the focus on self-destructive and all too often sociopathic role-models. Just take a look at our newspapers or turn on the TV and you will observe the escalating violence in our schools and universities. This type of anti-social behaviour from the future generations of our nation is a threatening reminder that the very fabric of our social structure is in danger of being torn asunder.
Despite of all the benefits that teaching character education offers to both the individual and society, there is no sure-fire formula or set standards on how and what to teach. While no general program exists that is suitable for all students, an established foundation for successful character education should follow certain methods and common principles. And if not handled carefully it can become a problem for both the educators and their charges. As children grow older, they figure out messages in their own way. Lessons fitting to character development stages allow children to make their own choices while bolstering positive group activities.
When character education blends both individualistic and collective play it encourages youngsters to apply their own perceptions and flair in most situations while also serving as good role models to their younger peers.
Emotional intelligence
While children are in school, open forums with active role-playing can provide practical tools to students for handling difficult moments and peer pressure. Moderated by teachers or, in later years, by the students themselves, the sharing among classmates is certain to encourage moral thought, ethical debate, decision-making, and crucial thinking.
The subject though should be devoid of moralising or indoctrination of any one type of belief or behaviour as being the right one for all. In its place, common principles based on shared values such as justice, equality for all, respect for individuality, empathy, kindness and integrity should serve as the elementary building blocks of all character education programs.
While there is no official certification required of etiquette teachers, you could become a credible authority on the subject if you start building your etiquette-related knowledge by reading books on the subject to improve your understanding of the topic. But remember teaching is more commonsense that is honed by the right refinement. Indeed every teacher should practice proper etiquette to prove their correctness as gurus. As an etiquette teacher, you should embody proper social practices. Particularly when establishing yourself in the industry, practicing what you preach is necessary.
Recent psychological studies have shown that emotional intelligence (EI) is as significant to a child’s success and fulfilment as good grades and a university degree. Etiquette seeks to enhance the EI of children by encouraging them to express and discuss their emotions, thereby improving their social sensitivity and public behaviour.
Along with increased self-confidence and the ability to relate to others, students of etiquette develop enhanced social skills and experience far less anxiety when handling peer pressure. The potential for school violence can also be reduced by practicing the responsible behaviour stressed in etiquette education.
International studies have shown that the effects of etiquette and character training are immediate and long lasting. For parents, educators and especially our children, etiquette education and character development pay big dividends. In all, it provides a crucial safety-net in both social or anti-social societies.
