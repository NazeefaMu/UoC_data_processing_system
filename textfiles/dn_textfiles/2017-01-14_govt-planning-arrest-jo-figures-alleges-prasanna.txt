Govt planning to arrest JO figures, alleges Prasanna

Gampaha District Parliamentarian Prasanna Ranatunga yesterday said that the government has planned to arrest a number of leading figures in the Joint Opposition (JO) ahead of Constitutional reforms. He said that the government is now in the process of silencing the opposition’s voice against the Constitutional reforms by arresting Joint Opposition members. “A committee comprising
Ministers Rajitha Senaratne, Patali Champaka Ranawaka and JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake has been authorised to take decisions with regard to the arrests of Joint Opposition Parliamentarians,” he said. He said that this committee decides whom should be arrested and whom should not.
“We have received information that the committee is now discussing on how Parliamentarians Udaya Gammanpila,Kumara Welgama, Mahindananda Aluthgamage can be arrested by framing false charges,” he said. Ranatunga accused the government of using all its resources to prevent the holding of the January 27 anti-government rally in Nugegoda.
