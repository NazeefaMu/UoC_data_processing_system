‘Governments have fallen sans public support at referendums’

There are instances both locally and internationally, where governments that failed to gain public support at referendums, were toppled, said MP Dullas Alahapperuma, addressing a meeting held in Naimana on Sunday night.
He added, “If the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) wins a majority of Sri Lanka’s 341 LG institutions, we too have a chance of coming back to power.”
The meeting was held at the Naimana Community Center, in support of the candidature of SLPP’s Dasanayake Jayawickrema and Attorney-at-Law Danesha Liyanage, for the Matara Pradeshiya Sabha.
“It was 10 months ago that British Prime Minister David Cameron of the Conservative Party, was forced to resign when his party failed to gain public support in favour of the referendum held to decide whether Britain should remain in the European Union (EU), or not (Brexit). In Sri Lanka, it was a Presidential Election that was held on January 8, 2015, but after President Maithripala Sirisena was sworn in at 4.42 pm on January 9, 2015, he appointed United National Party’s Ranil Wickremesinghe as the new Prime Minister at 4.55 pm. At the time, the UNP held only 46 seats in Parliament.
In accordance to our constitution, a new Prime Minister could be appointed only after the demise of the incumbent PM or on his resignation or if the Parliament rejects the statement of policy or Appropriation Bill, passes a vote of no confidence or he ceases to be a member of Parliament.
Nothing of the aforementioned took place, and the reason given for the appointment was that the people had rejected the government through their vote. Therefore, if the forthcoming LG poll is considered as a referendum at which the people reject the present government, then, the same principle should apply.”
Members of Parliament for the Matara district, Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, Kanchana Wijesekera, Niroshan Premarathne, and Provincial Councilor Aruna Gunerathne, also addressed the gathering.
