Calvin Harris ‘in talks for The X Factor Judges’ Houses’

According to The Sun newspaper, superstar DJ Calvin is top of judge Nicole Scherzinger's list to help her whittle down the hopefuls ahead of the live shows.
If Calvin did agree to appear on the ITV show, it would mark the end of a seven-year ban from the programme. The 32-year-old Scotsman hit headlines in 2009 when he stormed the stage as John and Edward Grimes, known as Jedward, performed Under Pressure by David Bowie and Queen. Mocking the twins' famous hairstyles, Calvin held a pineapple on top of his head as he ran onto the stage before security were called.
Following the incident, Jedward's mentor Louis Walsh branded Calvin an "idiot" while boss Simon Cowell, said to be furious at the musician's "shameless self promotion", banned him from appearing on The X Factor in the future.
However, sources told the publication that Simon and Calvin, who is officially the world's top earning DJ, have put their feud behind them.
"Calvin is rightly regarded as one of the biggest artists in music due to his phenomenal chart success," an insider said. "Simon wants A-listers on board and made a beeline for Calvin, ensuring him there would be no issues after the Jedward row.
"It was a long time ago and both have moved on so much since then."
Following the 2009 incident, Calvin defended himself by insisting his actions were an attempt to point out that Jedward were a novelty act competing on what was meant to be a "music show".
And in 2014 Calvin admitted he and Simon had a "mutual agreement to stay away from each other", adding: "As far as I’m aware, in fact definitely, I’m not allowed back on that show. Sadly that’s it for me and The X Factor."
While Calvin is said to be joining Nicole for Judges' Houses, Sharon Osbourne will apparently be aided by Robbie Williams while Alesha Dixon and former X Factor contestant Fleur East are reportedly set to help out Louis Walsh.
