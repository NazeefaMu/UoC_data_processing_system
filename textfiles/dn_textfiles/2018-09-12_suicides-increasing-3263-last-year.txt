Suicides increasing: 3,263 last year

A total of 3,263 had committed suicide last year according to the latest statistics, the Health Promotion Bureau (HPB) sources said.
According to the sources, 2,586 of them were males while 677 of them were females.
More men than women had committed suicide. There is a significant increase in suicides last year when compared to the past three years - 2016, 2015 and 2015.
About 19 percent had committed suicide due to problems related to family matters while 11.6 percent had committed suicide due to fatal or lifelong illnesses/diseases, the sources added.
One-third of the cases - 35.18 percent - did not have a specific reason to commit suicide. The way the media reports suicide had created a feeling in society that suicide gets sympathy or it is a heroic act, the sources added.
