Lamudi Lanka hosts Real Estate Expo

Leading property portal Lamudi Lanka (Pvt) Ltd. hosts its third Real Estate Expo this weekend. The event is set to provide direct access to the real estate world with a range of presenters and exhibitors showcasing Sri Lanka’s best property and home services to buyers, sellers and investors.
The third Expo is scheduled to take place on June 17 and 18 at the North Lawn, Taj Samudra from 10am to 7pm on both days.
The show will provide property seekers the chance to view the latest upcoming projects, meet leading real estate experts and obtain reliable services all at once.
Recognized as a leading online portal for properties, Lamudi states that one of the main objectives of the real estate expo is to reach out to property seekers who do not have internet access. Even though the country’s internet penetration is rising, there are still many people who do not have access to the internet on a daily basis. Therefore the real estate expo will be a hotspot for offline property hunters to discover the infinite opportunities available in the real estate industry. The rapidly evolving real estate in Sri Lanka
The relaxation of regulations regarding the buying of property and lands for locals and foreigners are continuously encouraging local buyers and foreign investments. The increasing internet penetration (27%) in the country is leading to increasing numbers of online property seekers in particular.
Thanks to technological advancements which have contributed to the improvements of Sri Lankan economy, the country is now exposed to multiple global opportunities, thus making it one of the most desirable destinations to purchase a home/apartment, invest, and foster new businesses.
Records and statistics from the past few years show that Colombo is the prime city where most property seekers and investors are interested in purchasing real estate. However, as a result of rapid urbanization, properties within the city’s limits are commanding very high prices, directing people to purchase properties in the outskirts as well as in Kandy, Galle, Rajagiriya, Dehiwala, and others.
Lamudi believes that the third real estate expo will be an ideal spot for property seekers to find their properties and for investors to discover better investment opportunities all under one roof. The event intends to provide developers with the opportunity to showcase their latest developments to a large crowd.
In addition to browsing and discovering a wide range of properties, visitors are also able to meet esteemed real estate experts directly and discuss their requirements to obtain reliable services and offers. Developers will be showcasing their projects in the form of 3D models giving potential buyers a clear vision of properties.
