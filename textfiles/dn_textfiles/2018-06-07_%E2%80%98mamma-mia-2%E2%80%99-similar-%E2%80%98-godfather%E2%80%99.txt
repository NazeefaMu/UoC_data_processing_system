‘Mamma Mia 2’  similar to ‘The Godfather’

‘Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again’ director Ol Parker has said that his upcoming film bears similarities with the classic gangster drama ‘The Godfather’.
According to a report, Parker’s film, a sequel to hit 2008 musical ‘Mamma Mia’, is set both in the past and present.
It marks the return of actors Meryl Streep, Amanda Seyfried, Julie Walters, Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, Stellan Skarsgard, Dominic Cooper and also feature Lily James and Cher.
“Obviously no one’s going to be comparing the two in the great canon of film, but that was very much the template.
It’s a beautiful idea that you can jump backwards and forwards and learn more about the present from the past,” he said.
The film is scheduled to release on July 20, ten years to the month of the original film’s release.
