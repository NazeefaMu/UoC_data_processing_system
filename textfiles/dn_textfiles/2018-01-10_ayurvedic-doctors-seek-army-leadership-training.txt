Ayurvedic doctors seek Army leadership training

Adding a new dimension and recognition to the training skills and capabilities of Army professionals, a few more than 640 new Ayurvedic medical practitioners (new physicians) of the Department of Ayurveda on January 8, began a six-day residential training on ‘Leadership Skills and Development of Positive Attitudes’ in five separate Army establishments.
Considered as one more contribution to the nation-building aspirations of the Commander of the Army, the project got underway simultaneously at islandwide Army training schools in Diyatalawa, Kalatthewa, Minneriya, Embilipitiya and Buwelikada after brief inaugural ceremonies at respective places.
The six-day training programme largely focuses on ‘Promotion of Leadership Skills and Qualities’, ‘Moulding of Social Discipline’, ‘Development of Vocational Skills’, ‘Preparedness to Overcome Challenges in Life’, ‘Generating of Correct Social Expectations’, ‘Conduct of Professional Guide’ and ‘Mental Equilibrium’ among the attendees.
Commander of the Army, Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake, in response to a request made by the Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine to the Ministry of Defence, has instructed Director General Training, Major General Vijitha Ravipriya, at the Army Headquarters, to facilitate the request.
Arrangements were put in place at those five main Army training centres, Marksmanship and Sniper Training School at Diyatalawa, Armoured Corps Training School, Kalaththewa, School of Artillery, Minneriya, School of Military Engineers, Embilipitiya and School of Signals, Boowelikada, under the supervision of respective commandants. This project coincides with the Commander’s conceptual notion that the Army should devote one-third of its dedication for nation-building tasks with the objective of supporting civil administration, in whatever way possible. A team of instructors of the Army would continue with lectures until January 12 before the final closing ceremony gets underway.
Senior officers and representatives of the Department of Ayurveda and Health Ministry officials were also present during inaugural ceremonies at those five main Army training centres. A similar training project for Samurdhi officials a few weeks ago ended successfully, for which President Maithripala Senanayake also extended greetings while he was in Polonnaruwa.
