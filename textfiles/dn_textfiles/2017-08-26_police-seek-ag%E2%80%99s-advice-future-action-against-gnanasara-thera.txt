Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera over a complaint that he had allegedly committed number of offences including obstruction of police from discharging their duties recently.
When the case pertaining to the incident came up before Colombo Additional Magistrate Buddhika Sri Ragala, the court was informed that the Organized Crimes Preventive Division had Attorney General's advice regarding the case in order to determine future legal action against Gnanasara Thera.
