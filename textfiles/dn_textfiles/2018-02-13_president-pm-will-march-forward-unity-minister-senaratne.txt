President, PM will march forward with unity: Minister Senaratne

President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe have agreed to march forward in unity after correcting the wrongs and mistakes of the government. They reached this agreement during discussions about the local government election results, Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Issuing a special statement yesterday, Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne further said the mandate received by the Yahapalana government at the January 8, 2015 Presidential election had been further strengthened by the results of the local Government election. So there was no need to change the Prime Minister or for the resignation of the government, he said.
Dr. Senaratne said according to the results of the local government election, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna had received only about 45 percent of the total votes cast. It was much less than the number of votes received by the former President at the last Presidential election. But all in all, a majority of voters had cast their votes against the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna which contested under the 'Pohottuwa' symbol.
Although the former President may have entertained a dream of becoming Prime Minister after winning the local government election or getting a general election, it would not happen. Neither the SLFP nor the UNP had proposed to offer the Prime Minister's post to the former President so far. People gave a mandate to the present government in 2015 to eliminate corruption and fraud. Leaders of the Yahapalana government had taken a firm decision to carry forward this endeavour without interruption.
Referring to an alleged statement made to the media by Joint Opposition Parliamentarian Dullas Alahapperuma to the effect that Dr Rajitha Senaratne was missing after the defeat in Beruwala, Dr. Senaratne said he had not fled to America like Alahapperuma did, but stayed back at his home. Dr. Senaratne said he would continue to assist in fulfilling the hopes and aspiration of the people in keeping with their mandate. Added to it he would take steps towards getting the President re-elected in 2020 too, he said.
