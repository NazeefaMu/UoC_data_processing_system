Waiting in the wings

For all intents and purposes, the main parliamentary opposition to the government has come from the group calling itself the ‘Joint Opposition’ within the parliamentary group elected from the United Peoples’ Freedom Alliance (UPFA) at the August 2015 general election.
Last week, the JO took an enormous political step: it held a rally in Nugegoda where the main drawcard was former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. This was the JO’s way of signalling to the government that a challenge was imminent, more so in the wake of Rajapaksa’s announcement that he would move for a change of government in 2017.
The publicity machine of the JO was out in full force. Arrangements were made to telecast the rally using live streaming over the internet. There was no danger of a poor crowd turnout: parliamentarians representing the various electorates were entrusted with the task of bringing in the numbers from their constituencies. To be fair, the rally did arouse genuine interest and a sizeable section of the general public was present despite the inclement weather, whatever their political persuasions were.
The JO hails the rally as a huge success. However, it must also know that numbers at public meetings do not necessarily translate into votes at elections. If they have any doubt about that, they only need to ask the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP).
Misusing state property
The Nugegoda rally did have its high points. The speech of Jathika Nidahas Peramuna (JNP) leader Wimal Weerawansa aroused much interest, not so much for its content but for the logistics that went in to its production.
Weerawansa is currently incarcerated at the Welikada prison on charges of misusing state property. Last week, he made a speech while he was in Parliament, which he is entitled to attend. This speech was obviously made with the intention of broadcasting it at Nugegoda and that is exactly what happened. No one can fault the JO for being short of inspiration!
The highlight of the evening though was former President and now Kurunegala district parliamentarian Mahinda Rajapaksa. He made a grand entrance to rousing cheers and chants of handing back the country to the ‘king’. There was great interest in what he would say.
Rajapaksa was careful not to vilify President Maithripala Sirisena. He would go only so far as to say, tongue in cheek, that he owed his return to politics, despite a wish to retire from public life, to President Sirisena. Apart from that barb, his criticism was directed mostly at the government in general and if at all to the United National Party (UNP) faction of the government.
Rajapaksa criticised the government’s policies, claiming that state resources were being sold off to foreign interests. He also criticised moves to amend the Constitution arguing that the government appeared to have forgotten its election pledges to abolish the Executive Presidency. References were also made to the Central Bank bond sale, a slogan echoed by speaker after speaker at the rally.
Separate parliamentary group
It was Mahinda Rajapaksa at his rhetorical best. If a startling revelation or an important declaration from the former President was anticipated, that did not materialise. And that begs the question, where to from here, for the JO?
It will be recalled that the JO held similar meetings at Hyde Park and at Kirulapone to consolidate their identity as a separate parliamentary group. Those meetings too were hailed as successes in terms of crowd attendances but thereafter, the enthusiasm for decisive action seemed to have fizzled out.
Therefore, the next strategy of the JO depends on the numbers it carries in Parliament and the options available to it, in terms of the Constitution. This is what the thinks tanks in the JO will be pondering over in the coming weeks.
Of course, in the meantime, it can gear itself for local government polls but the reality is that, even if it posts a creditable performance at these elections, it will not be alter the balance of power in the country. The same holds true for provincial council elections, some of which are due this year. At best, these could be barometers of public opinion and little more than that.
In Parliament, the JO commands 52 of the 95 seats under the UPFA banner. That leaves President Sirisena with 43 seats. Given that the UNP commands 106 seats, the President will be able to command the support of 149 seats- just one short of a two-thirds majority- in Parliament. As the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) has one seat of its own, even a two-thirds majority is possible.
In real terms then, for the JO to aspire to form a government, they need to muster the support of at least all the UPFA MPs and then obtain the support of a further eighteen parliamentarians, presumably from the UNP. This would involve engineering defections from the UNP.
The number of defections needed from the UNP would increase if all of the UPFA MPs do not support Rajapaksa. This is also likely to be the case as there will be at least a few dozen MPs who are ideologically opposed to the Rajapaksa style of politics and will stay loyal to President Maithripala Sirisena, no matter what. Rajapaksa is an astute politician and is a past master at cross-overs. He successfully snared many an UNPer with the offer of ministerial portfolios. Indeed, some of his staunchest supporters- the likes of Gamini Lokuge, Johnston Fernando and Keheliya Rambukwella- were UNP strongmen in their respective districts before they were ‘poached’ by Rajapaksa. The JO obviously believes they could make history repeat itself.
There is however a notable difference in the political equation. Rajapaksa enticed UNPers on to his side when he was the all-powerful Executive President and could dole out ministerial positions at will. Now he is an opposition parliamentarian aspiring for power- and he will never be the President because the Constitution bars it. In the best case scenario, he can only become Prime Minister and even then he will not have the final say on ministerial positions. Besides, the UNP is now in power and many of its members already hold positions of responsibility.
To woo UNPers to endorse Rajapaksa therefor is a tall order. That is why the JO, for all the public display of its perceived political strength, will have to devise an alternative political strategy if it is to cling to its dream of returning to power. Unfortunately for the JO, the Constitution also bars a general election until four and half years of the span of the present Parliament has elapsed, so forcing a poll is also not an option.
Limited options
In the near future then, the JO is realistically faced with limited options. The most it can do is to muster its resources as best as it can and compete in the Local Government and Provincial council elections. If it is able to register a creditable performance at these polls, it must then hope that it can keep that momentum going until 2020- when national elections are due.
Three years hence is however a long time in politics. There are bound to be many changes in the interim. These could include constitutional changes which may or may not suit their agenda. Also, Rajapaksa, although fighting fit now, would be nearly seventy five years of age then.
The mainstream SLFP and the UNP are both aware that while the possibility of the JO capturing power is not imminent, they do pose a threat to the government’s popularity by constantly highlighting its shortcomings and blunders. That is as it should be in a democracy. Mindful of these implications, there has been discussion at the highest levels of government about the possibility of a Cabinet reshuffle. While that may ruffle the feathers of some ministers, it may also strengthen the resolve of the partners in the National Unity government to work together until the end of their term.
It has already been an interesting first few weeks to the year- and the dynamics of Sri Lankan politics are such that there will be an even more absorbing contest in the months to come.
