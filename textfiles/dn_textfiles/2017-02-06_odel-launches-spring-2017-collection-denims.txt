ODEL launches Spring 2017 collection denims

Denim never goes out of fashion, but the ubiquitous fabric gets fresh expression in a dynamic and chic new Spring collection unveiled by ODEL, already the largest fashion repository in the country. The new collection reinforces ODEL’s status in on-trend fashion, as the go-to destination for branded denim wear from leading global brands.
Creations in denim of multiple finishes and degrees of distress form the core of the energetic new collection, supplementing ODEL’s extensive offering from brands such as Levi’s, Pepe Jeans London, Wrangler and Lee, as well as other denim and indigo items on the shelves of the country’s premier high fashion retail chain.
Aptly titled ‘Denim & Co.’ the new collection also features a range of compatible and complementary fabrics such as linen, chambray, viscose, single jersey, lite-stretch cotton, French terry, crape, and chiffon. “Since the 1950s when ‘rebels’ like James Dean made the fabric iconic, denim has always had a place in fashion,” said Ms Desiree Karunaratne, Group Marketing Director of Softlogic Holdings, which owns ODEL. “Its timeless trendinessenables denim to hold its own globally. Denim has the unique adaptability of either being dressed up or dressed down to suit virtually any occasion, so we are delighted to introduce an array of iconic denim brands in store. Customers can take their pick from our wide range of season favourites to be bang on trend this Spring.”
“ODEL is a destination that always reflects global trends with the multiple international brands that itpresents,” she said. “The new collection is a great example because denim is still one of the most versatile and practical fabrics, and continues to make a statement for the casual-chic facet of fashion.”
The Spring 2017 collection also uses textured crape, burnouts and soft rib fabric and prints including cameo, stripes and florescent detailing for effect. Shades of blue, black and green take pride of place.
