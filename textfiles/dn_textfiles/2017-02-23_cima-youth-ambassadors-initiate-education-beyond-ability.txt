CIMA Youth Ambassadors initiate 'Education Beyond Ability'

The CIMA Students’ Society or better known as CIMASS initiated a movement titled “Education Beyond Ability”.
CIMASS partnered with the Foundation of Goodness and constructed and equipped a Special Needs Centre in Dehigahalanda Maha Vidyalaya. Managed by the NGO School Relief Initiative (SRI), this project sought to set up a model centre which could be used as a benchmark for future projects of this nature.
The EBA initiative was launched in the hope that many more special needs centres would be set up in schools all over the island with the help of the community.
This initiative was first launched in March 2016, upon the identification of Dehigalanda Maha Vidyalaya through the screening process conducted by SRI.
This school had potential to help students with special needs but very little resources to do so, as a refurbished classroom and adequate number of teaching aides were needed for these students. Many well wishers and members of the public donated for this worthy cause.
The opening ceremony was held recently. The event was organised by the project officer L. K. A. Jayasinghe representing SRI and the occasion was graced by the presence of Wasantha Dissanayaka (acting Regional Education Director Tissamaharama), the Principal of the school T.G. Dharmasena, and Udari Ranaweera who heads the Centre, students from the school and CIMASS representatives.
Dissanayake applauded the effort made and stated that the responsibility of setting up such resource facilities is the responsibility of the government, but to see a students’ society such as CIMASS accomplishing such a feat is one that should be appreciated by all.
