Three-wheeler drivers' association for Kalutara

Preparations had been made in order to commence a professional three-wheeler drivers' association in the Kalutara.
Kalutara Urban Councillor Yohan Waduge and the Kalutara Professional Three-Wheeler Drivers' Club Chairman had held discussions in this regard at the Sri Poorvarama Dharma Vijaya Hall in Kalutara, recently.
An awareness programme for three-wheeler drives in the Kalutara town, was held last week as well.
