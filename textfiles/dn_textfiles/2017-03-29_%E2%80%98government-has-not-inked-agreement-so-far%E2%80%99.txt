‘Government has not inked agreement so far’

The government so far had not inked the Hambantota Port Development Agreement, Petroleum Resources Development Minister Chandima Weerakkody said.
He was addressing a press conference at the Petroleum Resources Development Ministry auditorium yesterday.
He said the Cabinet had appointed a sub committee in this regard and the decisions would be taken on the outcome of the committee.
The minister said the petroleum excavation project in the Mannar basin is in progress and international tenders were called for one slot. He said the LPG could be excavated for consumption within two years when a company is selected.
