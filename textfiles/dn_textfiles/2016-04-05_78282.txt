Ravin Sayer - first bowler from Central Province to capture 100 wickets

 
Trinity College captain and off spinner Ravin Sayer became the first bowler from the hill capital and Central Province to capture 100 wickets this season and he chose to achieve this feat in the 99th "Kandy's Battle of the Blues" against their traditional rivals St. Anthony's College at the Pallekelle International Cricket Stadium which was also the first time this Big Match was played outside the city of Kandy.
When the Antonians were put into bat on the first day Ravin Sayer had 98 wickets to his credit and wanted two to reach the three figure mark. He had figures of 5 for 35 in that innings and in the process reached 100 wickets for the season.
This is the second time he had captured 100 wickets in a season and he did so in 2014 when he captured 108 wickets. In 2015 he captured 96 wickets and a cruel fate denied him of 100 wickets as he had to miss one match for the correction of his delivery action which is now smooth and fine. In his first year in 2013 he captured 36 wickets.
Thus in four seasons of school cricket he had captured 344 wickets which is the highest number of wickets by a Trinitian. The other Trinitians who have captured over 100 wickets in a season are Sachith Pathirana, Rushan Jaleel and Akila Jayasundera. All are spinners.
Ravin Sayer is also a good batsman and he scored 632 runs and scored over 300 runs in 2014 and 2015.
His best bowling figures this season is 5 for 3 against St. Servatius College, Matara and 6 for 39 against Zahira College, Colombo.
His fine leadership saw his school scoring ten outright wins and a first innings loss against St. Peter's College saw his school being eliminated in the quarter finals of the League Championship.

Vs. Maliyadewa College 1 for 20, vs. St. Aloysius College 2 for 58, vs. St. Anthony's College, Wattala 5 for 31 and 5 for 56, vs. De Mazenod College 4 for 35 and 5 for 54, vs. D.S.
