‘Wonder  Woman 2’  is set in 1984

While the DC universe hasn’t exactly been a complete success so far, the one movie that was both critically praised and a commercial smash was ‘Wonder Woman’. It was the biggest grossing movie of last summer, and expectations are high for next year’s sequel. With production on ‘Wonder Woman 2’ about to start, producer Geoff Johns has teased a logo for the movie.
Johns took to Facebook to showcase the logo. It reads WW84, with the letters designed with a VHS-style static effect. We’ve known for some time that ‘Wonder Woman 2’ will be set in the 1980s, and this suggests that it’ll specifically take place in 1984. Hollywood Reporter
