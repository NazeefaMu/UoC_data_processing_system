‘Don 3’  is definitely  happening

Producer Ritesh Sidhwani said the third installment of Shah Rukh Khan starrer ‘Don’ Franchise will happen but he is waiting for the right script.
Sidhwani and Farhan Akhtar’s banner Excel Entertainment produced ‘Don’ (2006) and ‘Don 2’ (2011) starring Shah Rukh Khan in lead roles.
Asked about ‘Don 3’, Sidhwani said, “For any sequel or prequel or third part of a franchise film, say for ‘Don’, the character is very important... Even I am eagerly awaiting but I think we need to find the right script.”
“Are we going to make it? The answer is yes. I don’t exactly know the time... We have started thinking very seriously about ‘Don 3’ and we are toying with ideas. We will make it and hopefully it will be very soon,” he added during promotional interviews of ‘Fukrey Returns’ here in Mumbai. IANS
