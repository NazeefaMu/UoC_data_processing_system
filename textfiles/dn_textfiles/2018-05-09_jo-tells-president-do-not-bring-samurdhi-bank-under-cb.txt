JO tells President: Do not bring Samurdhi Bank under CB

Parliamentarian Bandula Gunawardena yesterday said the Joint Opposition(JO) will request President Maithripala Sirisena not to bring the Samurdhi Bank under the Central Bank as Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had stated at the May Day rally. Addressing a media briefing at the Economic Research Unit of the JO at the Vajirarama Buddhist Centre in Punchi Borella, Gunawardena said the Samurdhi Bank was created to obtain bank loans without following traditional banking system rules.
