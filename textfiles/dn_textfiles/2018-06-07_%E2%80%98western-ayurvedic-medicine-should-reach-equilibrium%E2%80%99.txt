‘Western, Ayurvedic medicine should reach equilibrium’

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne would present a Cabinet paper to offer vehicle permits for Ayurvedic doctors, soon. Permission had already been given for Ayurvedic doctors to conduct private practice after 4.00 pm, a Health Ministry spokesman said.
According to the spokesman, Minister Dr. Senaratne had stated that both Western and Ayurvedic medical treatment systems should be in equilibrium, adding that otherwise, the medical profession would not reach the required standards.
The minister further said appointments had been provided to 900 Ayurvedic graduates and that Health officials were instructed to establish Regional Health Services Directors’ Offices for the Ayurvedic system.
He said the main reason behind the inability to develop the Ayurvedic treatment system in Sri Lanka, was due to the local officials’ poor attitude towards it.
