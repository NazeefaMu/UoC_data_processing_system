Towering gingerbread castle

Artist, photographer and baker Christine McConnell, passionate about culinary trompe-l’oeil, has created an incredible gingerbread castle more than 1.50-meter-tall! Between pastry and architecture, this castle mixes many techniques like gingerbread, chocolate, almond paste or even stained glass made of sugar. Imagined for the Food.com website, this beautiful, fragile and delicate creation deliciously payed tribute to the spirit of Christmas and fairy tales. Mirror
