Meghan goes mini!

The Duchess of Sussex flashes her legs in a thigh-skimming £327 Judith and Charles tuxedo dress for charity performance of hit musical Hamilton in London before show-stopper Harry bursts into SONG on stage
The Duchess of Sussex looked stunning in a thigh-skimming tuxedo dress as she joined Prince Harry for a special charity performance of hit musical Hamilton tonight.
The royal couple beamed as they spoke to guests inside the foyer of the Victoria Palace Theatre, London, after being ushered inside through the stage door.
Meghan, 37, showed off her toned legs in a £327 dress by Canadian label Judith and Charles and Paul Andrew pumps for the occasion, while her husband Harry, 33, looked smart in a suit and tie.
The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were introduced to the show's award-winning creator, Lin-Manuel Miranda, and his wife Vanessa Nadal before the group took their seats in the theatre's Royal Circle.
Prince Harry then took to the stage with the cast where he burst into song himself with a rendition of You'll Be Back - sung by the character of his ancestor George III in the musical.
The event, which marks the royals' first public appearance in a month, is being held to benefit Prince Harry's charity Sentebale, which works with children and young people affected by HIV in southern Africa.
