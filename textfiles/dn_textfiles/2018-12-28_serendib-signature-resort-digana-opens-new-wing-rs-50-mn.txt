Serendib Signature Resort Digana opens new wing with Rs 50 mn

Serendip Signature Resort Digana, the tranquil, eco nature hideout unveiled its new wing on December 21 adding 10 more keys to its existing 16 with an investment of Rs 50 million.
The structure in a three acre, landscape depicting the rich traditions of Kandyan royalty, its history as well as the culture of Dumbaramitiyawatha (Kandyan hills), hit the limelight in July 2016 taking the Lankan nature hospitality landscape by storm.
The brainchild behind the project, top marketer and hotelier Serendib Signature Resort Digana Managing Director Dananjaya Rathnayake said the overwhelming demand for his property from tour operators enticed him into the investment for the new wing with 10 rooms.
Rathnayake was at his peak in his career operating as sales and marketing director in a blue ship multinational brewery company when the idea first mooted in his mind to enter the hospitality trade. Rathnayake scarified his lucrative post and launched the eco nature resort Serendib Signatue Digana in 2016 which was an instant hit among nature hunting guests.
Ratnayake emphasized that there was also a very big vacuum for properties which gives relaxing tranquil offers. Although there were a lot of hotels in towns and major cities with a lot of luxury, people need relaxation on and off, not like the good old days. “I saw these opportunities and invested in this property which took me one year and six months to complete with an initial investment of Rs 150 million.”
He said after the opening in 2016, July the responses were very positive. “As a part of my Social responsibility most of my 35 member staff are recruited from the village and trained.”
He said during the past two and a half years there were lots of challenges particularly when the Digana issue propped up. But sheer commitment and passion by his team had managed to overcome them. He said in July 2018 he thought of putting up 10 more rooms due to the sheer pressure from travel agents who loved the property for its unique features.
He said the property was completed with Kandyan architecture, Laksha work and Dumbara ratha which are some of the key themes used in interior designing which speaks out the Kandyan identity.
He said they also have some special Kandyan local cuisines and traditional Serendib Signature lunches plus having everything from A la carte of Western to Eastern and Indian cuisine.
The hotel facilitates many activities that the clientele can engage in which simultaneously fulfills the need for relaxation and grasping the full Sri Lankan traditional experience.
Another option is village tracking on bikes with the bikes being provided by the hotel. Hotel also organizers several other excursions to nearby attractions such as Victoria Golf Club and also to Dumbara Ratha village and the Laksha work village of Hapuwida which allows guests to become familiar with the ancient origins of the wonderful traditional designs.
The hotel is also gaining a reputation for hosting corporate meetings at their fully equipped conference facility. Even though initial average occupancy rates stood at 40%, it has skyrocketed to 80% within the short time frame since its beginning till present, owing to the unique serenity that it offers, Rathnayake said.
He said with the success of this venture they were planning to go into two more resorts down south close to Yala and Sigiriya or Habarana in the cultural triangle with an investment of Rs 250 million for each property. The constructions of the two resorts will commence in 2020.
