A new 3TMRI scanner

Lanka Hospitals PLC recently launched the state of the art new 3 TESLA MRI scanner; an advanced technology which can project accurate imaging for a variety of medical specialties recently.
The all-new 3 TESLA MRI, now available for patients at Lanka Hospitals gives patients the comfort of shorter scan times, broader tunnel to ease claustrophobia, less noise, high image quality and accurate diagnoses.
“The new 3T Scanner is equipped with advance dedicated coils and programs for advanced neuro imaging, plaque studies, cardiac MRI and functional MRI and whole body diffusion weighted imaging,” said Consultant Radiologist Dr. Eranga Perera at the launch.
Dr. Perera also added that the scanner is also equipped with a dockable table, a 1st in the country’s healthcare industry, where the MRI table can be transported to transit trauma patients straight from the ambulance to the MRI suite.
Lanka Hospitals Radiology and Imaging Department also introduced a new facility for critical and pediatric patients, where they can undergo MRI imaging under anesthesia.
The team of in house consultant radiologists and visiting consultant radiologists of Lanka Hospitals are available around the clock, for quick reporting within a day.
