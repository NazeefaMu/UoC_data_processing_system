Wildlife wonders !

Saturday, March 3 was World Wildlife Day, which coincides with the adoption of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) in 1973. CITES plays an important role in ensuring that international trade does not threaten the species’ survival.
We all extend courtesy and good manners and charity to our own species, but do we ever think about protecting wild plant and animal species and their habitats? So you will come to realise that nature conservation is important. In fact, it is essential. But it is not because we need to save the planet. It is because we need to save us from ourselves.
The theme for World Wildlife Day 2018 is ‘Big Cats’. Using the expanded definition of big cats, the Day will raise awareness on the conservation of the lion, tiger, leopard and jaguar, as well as the cheetah, snow leopard, puma, clouded leopard and related species.
In both our neck of the woods and around the world, leopards are in trouble. The big spotted cats have been hunted to extinction in some areas, and their habitat is under pressure from growing human populations. Among other findings, researchers have confirmed that the Sri Lankan leopard is a genetically-distinct subspecies (Panthera pardus kotiya) that has its own unique habits. But studying wild leopards isn’t easy, as they are expert at hiding themselves in the forest’s brush and shadows. And they are most active at night, further complicating surveys.
Leopard lovers in Sri Lanka and elsewhere are taking steps to protect these powerful creatures. But while parks and preserves have helped save leopard habitat, the cat’s striking pelt continues to make it an attractive target for poachers. While not as fashionable as they once were, a leopard fur can still fetch thousands of dollars on the black market.
In Sri Lanka, researchers believe poaching has helped reduce leopard populations by up to 75 percent over the last century. While firm numbers are scarce, biologists estimate that less than 500 of the big cats remain in the island nation.
Sri Lanka harbours a remarkable assortment of plant, animal, fish, frog, lizard and serpent species, ranging from majestic mammals such as elephants and leopards to rare medicinal plants and wildflowers. Unfortunately, many of our species have not fared well over the past few decades as a result of habitat loss and the spread of invasive species.
The day serves to remind us that endangered and threatened species of wildlife and plants are of aesthetic, ecological, educational, historical, recreational, and scientific value to the world and its people. Everyone should be concerned by the disappearance of unique creatures and plant life.
It is crucial that governments ensure that we conserve the ecosystems upon which endangered and threatened species depend. Although extinctions occur naturally, scientific evidence strongly indicates that the current rate of extinction is much higher than the natural or background rate of the past.
The main force driving this higher rate of loss is the destruction of habitat. Over-exploitation of wildlife for commercial purposes, environmental pollution, and the spread of diseases also pose serious threats to our world’s biological heritage. Perhaps the greatest threat to many species is poaching and the illegal trafficking of wildlife parts and products.
This crime involves hundreds of threatened and endangered species, from elephants, rhinos, leopards and tigers, to lesser known birds, reptiles, fish, and plants. Every day, rampant greed and corruption drive a soaring trade to feed growing markets, particularly across Africa and Asia. All too often, local people suffer in the process.
Conservationists warn that by 2025 as many as one fifth of all animal species may be lost, gone forever. In recent times, hundreds of species have become extinct as a result of human activities.
Habitat destruction by illegal logging, ever-encroaching human settlement, pollution of water, soil, and air and illegal hunting to supply the demand for skins, hides, traditional medicines, food, and tourist souvenirs all threaten species’ existence.
Global warming too has made the protection of endangered species increasingly challenging. Climate change not only affects our plants and animals directly, through changes in temperature, but can worsen the impact on endangered species of traditional threats, such as invasive species, wildfires and diseases.
Besides, over the last few decades it seems as if forestry has gone mad in our little island nation. Large-scale illegal logging and clearing operations have drastically reduced the country’s forest cover. As far back as 1980, conservationists had complained that the Upper Mahaweli watershed was being spiked at its source by the constant rape of its surrounding forests.
The situation had become so serious that it prompted the then government to establish a combined task force comprising police and army units to track down the timber pirates. Still, the decades of destruction of our beautiful tropical woodlands have taken their toll. Statistics have proved that the problem is and has been a grave one. In 1956, Sri Lanka’s forests covered about 7.2 million acres of the country’s total land area of approximately 16 million acres. Today, the forest cover stands around 3 million acres, reduced from 44 per cent to less than 16 per cent within the last 50 years.
Wildlife crime is a serious offence, not a distant problem in a faraway country. It has decidedly become a global challenge that spans continents and crosses oceans. It matters, and not just because we care about elephants, leopards, tigers, rhinos and other fascinating creatures. Local communities that depend on wildlife for tourism or sustenance are being robbed of their livelihoods.
One of the many tangible benefits of biological diversity has been its contributions to the field of medicine. Each living entity contains a unique reservoir of genetic material that has evolved over aeons. This material cannot be retrieved or duplicated if lost. So far, scientists have investigated only a small fraction of the world’s species and have just begun to unravel their chemical secrets to find possible human health benefits to mankind.
The world’s best loved species are being slaughtered by widespread and dangerous criminal networks. Driven by a voracious demand for illegal animal parts and products, the black market in wildlife rivals illegal arms and drugs trafficking. Increasingly, wildlife traffickers are the same kingpins involved in trafficking people and arms and narcotics. The majestic elephants are being decimated for their tusks, the magnificent leopards and big cats for their pelts and bones.
Extinction is forever. We must act now and have our voices heard. Time is running out.
