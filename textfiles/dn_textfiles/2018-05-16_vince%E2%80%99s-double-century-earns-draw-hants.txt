Vince’s double century earns draw for Hants

LONDON, Monday: James Vince boosted his England selection chances by batting through the entire final day to guide Hampshire to a draw against Somerset at Taunton in their English County Championship match played at Taunton.
He scored 201 not out from 437 balls as the visitors went from 178-2 overnight to 432-4 when the game ended with Hashim Amla making 107.
Somerset, who were without the injured Jack Leach, took only two wickets on day four, but still claimed 13 points.
Vince began the day on 63 and he and Amla took their partnership to 194, with the South African reaching a 52nd first-class century before edging a short ball from Lewis Gregory to the keeper.
Vince was solid in defence, reining in his attacking instincts and offering just a few half-chances in his marathon innings. His 514-minute knock - the longest of his first-class career - earned Hampshire nine points and did his chances of selection to face Pakistan in Tests at Lord's on 24 May and Headingley on 1 June nothing but good.
Essex captain Ryan ten Doeschate said Australian bowler Peter Siddle made "one of the great overseas contributions" he has seen since he has been at the club. Paceman Siddle, 33, finished his four-game spell with 5-37 as Essex completed victory over Worcestershire.
Siddle took 20 wickets at an average of 16.10 in his four County Championship matches, with Essex's season-opener at Yorkshire abandoned without a ball being bowled because of a wet outfield. He has 62 Test caps but has not represented Australia in the five-day format since November 2016.
England paceman Mark Wood took a career-best 6-46 for Durham as their County Championship game against Derbyshire ended in a draw.
The 28-year-old, who is hoping to be named in England's squad for the first Test against Pakistan, bowled 22 overs on the final day, but his side were unable to force a win. Derbyshire had reached 279-9 in their second innings, a lead of 186, when the captains shook hands.
James Bracey hit an unbeaten century as Gloucestershire dug in to earn a draw against Middlesex at Lord's.
Resuming on 66-2, and trailing by 179, the visitors appeared set for their second defeat of 2018 on the final day. But Gareth Roderick's 48 helped them pass 150 before he was caught off James Harris (3-60) and Jack Taylor (41) and Bracey added 91 for the fourth wicket.
The 21-year-old reached 125 alongside Graeme van Buuren (46) before they declared on 326-4, ahead by 81 runs. The draw was the second of the season for both sides, and Middlesex are fifth in the table, with Gloucestershire seventh, as switch to for the start of the One-Day Cup.
Sam Curran took 10 wickets in a match for the first time as Surrey wrapped up victory over Yorkshire by an innings and 17 runs at The Oval.
The home side needed only 9.1 overs on the final morning to finish the job after Yorkshire resumed on 142-5. Rikki Clarke had Jonny Bairstow caught behind for 29 and the innings ended at 168 with Jack Leaning out for 28. In between, all-rounder Curran took three wickets in six balls to finish with 4-47 and match figures of 10-101.
The win was unbeaten Surrey's second of the season and earned them a maximum 24 points, lifting them to third in the Division One table, nine points behind leaders Notts, but with a game in hand.
