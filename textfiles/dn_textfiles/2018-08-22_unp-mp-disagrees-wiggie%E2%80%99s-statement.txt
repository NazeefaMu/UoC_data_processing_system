UNP MP disagrees with  Wiggie’s statement

UNP MP Thushara Indunil yesterday said that he does not agree with Northern Province Chief Minister C.V.Vigneshwaran’s recent statement with reference to archeological ruins in the Nothern Province. Condemning Vigneshwaran’s statment, MP Indunil pointed out that Joint Opposition MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara has a responsibility in conveying the same massage to Vigneshwaran who is his in law.
MP Indunil made this observation speaking at a press breif held at Sirikotha yesterday morning.
