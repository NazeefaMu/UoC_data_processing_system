Cabinet approval for drafting of local legislation on ‘Ottawa Convention

Cabinet approval has been granted for the drafting of local legislation that would enforce the ‘Ottawa Convention on the Prohibition of the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of anti-personnel mines and on their destruction’ in the country.
The Ottawa Convention known as the mine ban treaty aims at eliminating anti-personnel mines around the world. At present, there are 164 state parties to the treaty. One state (the Marshall Islands) has signed but not ratified the treaty, while 32 UN states, including the United States, Russia, China and India are non-signatories, making a total of 33 United Nations states not party to the treaty.
With cabinet approval being received, Justice and Prison Reforms Minister Thalatha Athukorale has directed the Legal Draftsman to draft legislation which would enable the provisions of the treaty enforceable within Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka acceded to the Treaty in December 2017.
