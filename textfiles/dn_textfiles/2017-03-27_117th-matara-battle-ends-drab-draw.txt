117th Matara Battle ends in drab draw

The 117th big match between St Servatius College and St Thomas’ College ended in a draw (the 58th in the series) at the Uyanwatta Stadium yesterday.
The Servatians invited to bat first managed to post 207 after which they rattled the Thomians with their trump card Thilan Prashan who had STC reeling with three wickets down for seven runs. They literally crawled to 211 batting for 110.1 overs.
Thilan ended the day with a six-wicket haul while Lahiru Dilshan (72), Raminda Pravinath (43) and Tharusha Kavindya (30) were the only batsmen to make noteworthy scores.
St Servatius declared their second essay at 174/6 in 68 overs giving the Thomians an impossible victory target of 171 runs to be scored in 8 overs.
The Thomians were 20 for no loss when the players claimed the stumps as mementos and the spectators invaded the field.
Scores:
St Servatius 207 and 174/6 dec in 68 overs (Supun Kavinda 42, Thilan Prashan 38, Keshara Nuwantha 24, Sandaru Nethmina 25 n.o., Hashin Dilman 4/59)
STC Matara 211 in 110.1 overs (Raminda Pravinath 43, Lahiru Dilshan 72, Tharush Kavindya 30, Akila Thiwanka 21, Thilan Prashan 6/48) and 20/0 in 3 overs.
