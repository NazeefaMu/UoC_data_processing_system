Alex Paranthaman in transcreation

Alex Paranthaman is a talented writer not widely known by academic critics His métier is poetry. From Mannar, Kaiveli, Chettikulam, Matalan and finally in Mullivaikkal (all in the Northern Province) he has seen and undergone severe calamity in the name of protected war.
Jeevanathi Publishers have published a 70-page book of his poems. Instead of my reviewing the book I prefer to transcreate some of his poems into English so that the non-Tamil readers could understand how a section of the humanity suffered in a prolonged war for nearly 30 years. His title of the book is befittingly called “Deadly Pains” (Marana Valikal). There are a large number of poems, short and long in this collection priced at Rs.300.
Let’s go into some of his poems as read in English:
Born as a Tamil, spoke in Tamil, laboured for Tamil, at last, the State gave me a gift to walk steadily
Two walking sticks. *
One is holding an umbrella to a governing party, and the one who voted for him is also holding an umbrella inside his leaking house*
Tamil corpses breathed out their last address- Mullivaaikaal*
Wealthy comfort policies changed places during one night
The Vanni warzone smiled silently within itself finding the smallness of the turncoat chairs when tens of thousands were uttered. *
“Blow him to kill” is the pastime slogan in the country, True. What’s its matter living or dead
So long as accused as “Drohi” hunting you, understand the death pit is not far from here*
Those escaping death are dying again psychologically affected. Apart from the heaviness of the losses, pain envelops further due to their helplessness. Cheaters are climbing up stepping on those dying escaping deaths and continuing their journey-these watchers. *
Caught in the shelling, losing parts of our bodies, unable to carry them, crossing the small canals we reach Chettikulam. And yet until now, it is not a fertile soil. *
I find it difficult to read more poems in this collection because reading his poems I am weeping and visualizing the agony of many generations of the Tamil community have undergone during the gruesome war and more importantly after the war. The people there are like walking shadows losing everything they had.
Sitting in Colombo, I never knew the horror they have experienced for more than five decades.
I wish that I trans create all his poems, particularly his longer poems, but I cannot do that because I am weeping most of the time reading his poems unable to find the appropriate words to use.
Alex Paranthaman’s poems are not merely a realistic account of what he had suffered or observed but the collection also reveals how an artist in him endures the present hoping some salvation could be provided by the state to all those innocent people affected. What they need is kindness, empathy, love and proper channelling of funds for their reasonable urgent needs by all of us.
The priority of the State is to attend to all the people who have lost everything in all parts of the country to live as decent citizens of the country.
