Outstanding Contribution to the Legal Profession

New President’s Counsel:
The appointing of President’s Counsel recognise the work of prominent lawyers who have made their mark in the legal field. They also reflect notable achievements over the years including outstanding work, impressive strategic growth and excellence within the legal system.
President’s Counsel is a professional rank and status, conferred by the President under Article 33 of the Constitution of Sri Lanka which is recognised by courts. It does not entail the title holder to be a state prosecutor or employed by the state or part of the office of the President.

Anura B. Meddegoda
Anura Bandara Meddegoda’s career as an Attorney-at-Law of the Supreme Court spans 34 years. He took Oaths on October 2, 1981.
Prior to being called to the Bar, Meddegoda apprenticed in the Chambers of Faisz Musthapha, President’s Counsel, late President’s Counsel Nehru Goonetilleke, and late President’s Counsel Tivanka Wickremesinghe, .
Shortly after his Call to the Bar, on January 1, 1982, Meddegoda joined the Department of the Attorney General as a State Counsel. In 1993, he was appointed a Senior State Counsel. During the course of his legal career in Sri Lanka, as Counsel for the State, he has appeared in major criminal prosecutions in the High Court and the Magistrates’ Courts of Sri Lanka and also appeared in the Superior Courts.
In 1994 Meddegoda joined the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal where he worked in the Office of the Prosecutor as a prosecuting Trial Attorney/Legal Adviser. He has acquired wide and varied experience in international law and relations, particularly in the investigation and prosecution of serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights and has also been actively involved with maintaining peace and security and working towards reconciliation amongst communities in strife torn countries in the former Yugoslavia.
In cases before the International Criminal Tribunal, Meddegoda has appeared as Counsel in trials as well as appeals before both the Trial and Appellate Chambers of the Tribunal. Whilst working in the International Criminal Tribunal, he has had nearly 10 years’ experience in negotiations between the Office of the Prosecutor and the Government of the Republic of Croatia (GRC) and the FRY. These negotiations at meetings with Prime Ministers, Ministers of government, Ambassadors, Judges, Prosecutors and other law enforcement officials have resulted in improved relations between the International Criminal Tribunal and the relevant States, particularly in the areas of State co-operation and support in the flow of information and evidence, establishing protocols and modalities for such purpose, enacting new legal instruments and proactive support in the arrest and surrender of fugitives.
In a letter addressed to the then Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs about his work in the International Criminal Tribunal, the then Prosecutor Justice Louise Arbour has stressed upon the important role Meddegoda has played in the Office of the Prosecutor “in the investigation and prosecution of persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in the former Yugoslavia” and commended him as an “outstanding lawyer” “performing work of the highest professional standard” and that the Government of Sri Lanka and the Department of the Attorney General “has every right to be proud of the contribution” made by him.
Upon his return to Sri Lanka in 2005, Meddegoda reverted to active legal practice and has developed an extensive and successful practice appearing in a very large number of cases, in both the original and appellate courts in the areas of Fundamental Rights, Criminal Law, Commercial Law, Matrimonial Law, Industrial and Labour Law, Testamentary Law, and Intellectual Property Law. He hs also been retained in particular cases to appear as Junior Counsel to eminent senior lawyers namely, Faisz Musthapha PC, Romesh de Silva PC, Shibly Aziz, PC, Gamini Marapana PC, S. Sivarasa PC, M. M. Zuhair PC, Dr. B. J. P. De Almeida Gunaratne PC, and the late C. R. de Silva PC.
He has also been retained to appear on behalf of, and also provided advice on Sri Lankan legal issues to, several foreign governments and Law Firms.
Meddegoda has also had the opportunity to address judicial and law enforcement agencies in the former Yugoslavia and public fora including the Asian Society of International Law and the International Committee of the Red Cross on a variety of legal issues pertaining to international humanitarian law. He possesses an Honour’s degree in International Law from King’s College University of London.
He has been a Lecturer in the law of Criminal Procedure at the Sri Lanka Law College and been a visiting lecturer in International Humanitarian Law in the University of Colombo. He has also lectured and made presentations at a number of Seminars including Seminars organized by the Bar Association of Sri Lanka and the Colombo Law Society.
Meddegoda has been actively involved with the activities of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) having served in the Executive Committee of BASL during the stewardship of President’s Counsel Shibly Aziz, and President’s Counsel. Upul Jaysuriya, .
He has served on numerous committees of BASL including being Chair of the Public Interest Litigation Committee, Continuing Legal Education Committee, Police-Bar Relations Committee and the Overseas Relations Committee. As Chair of the Public Interest Litigation Committee, Meddegoda appeared in support of several public interest litigation cases including the Pasyala Police shooting case in the Court of Appeal, Matale mass grave exhumation case in the Matale Magistrate’s Court, Rathupaswala incident in the Magistrate’s Court Gampaha, Beruwela communal violence case in the Magistrate’s Court Kalutara.
Meddegoda who has an unblemished record as an Attorney-at-Law has consistently maintained the highest standards of integrity, conduct and professional rectitude.
In April 2004, Meddegoda was appointed as Secretary Ministry of Justice and Judicial Reform by Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunge which appointment he could not take up due to his ongoing commitments at the time with the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague.

Herath started his career in the jurisdiction of the Anuradhapura Courts, won many clients and a reputation for hard work and commitment to his work within a short period of time.
