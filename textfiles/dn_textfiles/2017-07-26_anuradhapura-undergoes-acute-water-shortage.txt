Anuradhapura undergoes acute water shortage

A few irrigation tanks in the Anuradhapura district contain water at present even though district boasts 2,449 tanks, sources from the Agrarian Services Development Department said.
The district counts a population of 893,000 and 300,000 persons receive drinking water from the Tissawewa, Thuruvila, and Nuwarawewa reservoirs.
The Water Supply and Drainage Board indicates that if the water capacity of the Nuwarawewa tank goes down to around 6,000 acre feet, providing drinking water will be a major issue as the water available at that level get mixed with sediment and other waste.
The Mahaweli Authority has released additional water to the Tissawewa and Thuruwila tanks.
Although the government agent Anuradhapura and WSDB (NCP) have asked the Mahaweli Water Management Committee to release 300 acre feet of Mahaweli water to Nuwarawewa, so far they have not responded.
The Mahaweli water from the Kalawewa cannot be sent directly to the Nuwarawewa. It should come via the Nachchaduwa tank but it has to be filled to a larger capacity so as to get released the water.
Therefore, the public are requested to use the pipe-borne water from Nuwarawewa, Thuruvila and Tisawewa economically without wasting the water for unnecessary tasks like car washing, the Government Agent RM Wanninayake said.
