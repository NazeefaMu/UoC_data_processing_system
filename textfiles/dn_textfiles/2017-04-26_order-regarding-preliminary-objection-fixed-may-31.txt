Order regarding preliminary objection fixed for May 31

The Colombo Chief Magistrate yesterday fixed date for order regarding the preliminary objection raised by Major Nevil Wanniarachchi, the ex-Chief Security Officer (CSO) of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa over five corruption cases filed by the Bribery Commission.
Accordingly, the Court would deliver its order regarding the preliminary objections on May 31.
The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed five corruption cases in the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court against Major Nevil Wanniarachchi over non-declaration of assets and liabilities. The Bribery Commission alleged that Major Wanniarachchi had failed to declare his assets and liabilities for a period of five years since 2010 to 2014 while serving as an Army Commissioned Officer.
The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed charges against the former Minister in the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court under Section 9 of the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law No.1 of 1975. Defence Counsel Sampath Mendis appeared for the accused.
