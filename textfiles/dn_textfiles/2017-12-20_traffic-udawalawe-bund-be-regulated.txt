Traffic on Udawalawe bund to be regulated

Since the safety of the Udawalawe reservoir bund has been threatened due to the movement of heavy vehicles and unregulated parking of vehicles, Deputy Project Director, Engineer Sujeewa Gunasekara has decided to regulate vehicular traffic on the bund.
At a recent meeting held in this connection he had decided on the following measures to protect the bund and prevent any future damage to it.
They are to impose a speed limit on vehicles, including heavy vehicles using the bund, proscribe parking of vehicles on the road across the bund and to close down the adjoining road across the Udawalawe reserve for vehicular traffic.
The meeting was attended by the Walawe Mahaweli zone Project Manager Osmund de Silva and OICs of the Uda Walawe, Sevanagala and Embilipitiya Police Stations, among others.
