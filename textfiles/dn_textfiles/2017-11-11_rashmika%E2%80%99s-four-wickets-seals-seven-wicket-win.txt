U19 Youth Asia Cup:
Rashmika’s four wickets seals seven-wicket win

Thisaru Rashmika ran through the UAE batting with his left-arm fast-medium seamers taking four wickets for 17 runs to help Sri Lanka win their opening match of the Under 19 Youth Asia Cup by seven wickets at Malaysia.
Rashmika with the help of vice-captain Jehan Daniel’s right-arm fast-medium bowling (3/14) shot out UAE for a paltry 66 runs off 22 overs.
Sri Lanka lost three wickets in chasing down that target.
Scores:
UAE U19 – 66 in 22 overs (Syed Haider 16, Hrithik 11; Thisaru Rashmika 4/17, Jehan Daniel 3/14, Praveen Jayawickrama 2/13, Kalana Perera 1 for 18).
Sri Lanka U19 - 68/3 in 16 overs (Kamindu Mendis 27 n.o., Krishan Arachchige 15, Nipun Dhananjaya 11 n.o., Shah Faisal Khan 2/30, Fahad Nawaz 1/11)
