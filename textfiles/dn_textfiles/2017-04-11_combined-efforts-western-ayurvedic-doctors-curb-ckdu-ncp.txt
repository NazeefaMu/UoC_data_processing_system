Combined efforts by Western, Ayurvedic doctors to curb CKDu in N.C.P

Under the ‘Pibidemu’ Polonnaruwa Programme, priority has been given to providing drinking water to the public, with the aim of curbing the fast spreading kidney disease.
The Chinese government on the request of President Maithripala Sirisena has extended its financial support to realize this venture, said the CM (NCP) Peshala Jayarathna Bandara.
He said this at the inauguration of the newly constructed Medirigiriya Ayurvedic central dispensary. The PC (NCP) has spent Rs. 8.5 million for the completion of the Hospital.
The CM said native medicine and nature were very strongly interconnected . Today we have fallen prey to various health hazards including kidney and heart ailments since we challenge nature and resort to artificial methodologies.
The North Central Ayurvedic Commissioner Dr. Kumara Alwis said Cabinet had approved the proposal for upgrading the Medirigiriya central Dispensary to an Ayurvedic hospital consisting of a ward complex and other appropriate medical and health care facilities.
He emphasized that it was encouraging that western doctors in the NCP are working together with Ayurvedic and native doctors, to cure CKDu and CKD patients in the region.
North Central Provincial Health Minister K.H. Nandasena, Parliamentarian Sampath Sri Nilantha and Provincial Health Secretary Saman Bandulasena were present at the opening.
