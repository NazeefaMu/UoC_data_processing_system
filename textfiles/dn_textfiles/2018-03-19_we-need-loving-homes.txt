We need loving homes

Three cute fur balls are looking for homes. Two months old puppies (one male and two females), a Sri Lankan breed are vaccinated for Rabies, Pavo, DHL and are dewormed. Transport can be arranged and will take over the neutering and sterilization costs when the pups are older. Call on 0777576077 to adopt.
