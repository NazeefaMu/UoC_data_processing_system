Open warrant re-issued against Jaliya Wickramasuriya

Colombo Fort Magistrate yesterday, re-issued an open warrant for the arrest of former Sri Lankan Ambassador to the United States Jaliya Wickramasuriya due to his failure to appear before Court.
The FCID had filed a B report at the Fort Magistrate’s Court against Jaliya Wickramasuriya for allegedly misappropriating USD 330,000 out of USD 6.6 million allocated for the purchase of a building for the Sri Lankan Embassy in the US.
When the case came up before Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne, neither the suspect nor the sureties were present in Court.
At a previous occasion too, the Court was informed through the Defense Counsel that Jaliya Wickramasuriya had gone abroad for medical treatment with Court permission, but had failed to return before the due date. The Defense Counsel said that his client was still receiving treatment at a hospital in USA.
Accordingly, the Magistrate yesterday, re-issued warrants for the arrest of the two sureties including the wife of Jaliya Wickramasuriya, for their failure to appear before Court.
Meanwhile, the Court issued orders directing 79 banks and non bank financial institutions that financial transactions pertaining to Jaliya Wickramasuriya be provided to the FCID to carry out further investigations.
The FCID was directed to file a report regarding the progress of the investigation on August 27.
The FCID alleged that the suspect had misappropriated the concerned amount committed during the purchase of a building to house the Sri Lankan Embassy at 3025, White Haven Street, Washington 20008. The former Ambassador had remitted this money to Sri Lanka. The former Ambassador is a close relative of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
