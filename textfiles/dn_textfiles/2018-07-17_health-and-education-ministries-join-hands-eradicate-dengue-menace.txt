Health and Education Ministries join hands to eradicate dengue menace

Health Ministry and Education Ministry have agreed to launch a joint programme to destroy dengue mosquito breeding sites located inside school premises, Health Ministry spokesman said.
According to the spokesman, many school premises have also become breeding grounds of dengue. The entomologists had found dengue mosquito larvae even inside bamboo used for fences around schools. They had found dengue larvae in several leading schools in Colombo out of 56 schools inspected by them. Dengue Control Committees in schools will be activated as a result.
Construction sites are the other popular dengue mosquito breeding sites. It is discovered that around 4,000 construction sites in the country at the moment are targets of dengue mosquito breeding. Arrangements will be made to implement a special programme to destroy mosquito breeding sites located inside construction sites under the direction of Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, he said.
Special training and another allowance will be given to the 1,500 field assistants recruited to control dengue. Cabinet approval had been received to purchase 50 more vehicles for mosquito control activities, he added.
