Janet the amazing artist of the Donald Trunk book series explains that the secret to great story telling is always fantastic illustrations that bring the characters to life in memorable, unforgettable ways. After being driven off Nicobar island in hilarious circumstances due to accidentally creating Crabzilla, Donald Trunk, Sri Lanka’s Swimming elephant continues on his mission to find the meaning of life in the latest book to be launched in January 2019. This time taking on a serious job restoring the second kingdoms man made water reservoirs, only to be side-tracked on a mission to redeem the legendary graveyard elephant treasure, which he believes has been taken by the colonialists. As he travels on his quest across the world to Europe, the monstrous Crabzilla pursues him. Trunk negotiating the practical difficulties faced by an elephant dealing with overzealous Western immigration, using modern modes of transport and meeting another array of fascinating characters, who either thwart his progress by creating diversions or help him on his way. Donald experiences life of all colours: slogging away at rebuilding Sri Lanka’s irrigation system in Polonnaruwa created by the Great King , where he meets other elephants in the heat of the tropical sun; accidentally finding the cursed elephant killer’s grave in the Hill Country, which is struck by lightning every year; and only escaping Italian police by pretending to be an elephant fountain, before finally re-wilding in Sussex, of all places, where he joins Tusk Book to find a mate.
The book is full of more trunk-speak, twists and turns and humorous takes on the modern high tech confusing wired world we live in, including East-West contrasts such as Donald being told by butterflies that he can only meet a mate by taking lots of pictures using ‘flitter’ and going on the ‘bumble bee’ dating site, instead of meeting a mate at a watering hole in Sri Lanka. Trunk also gets tricked by his ego into thinking there is a fast food joint named after him, MrDonalds, where he can get a ‘Big MAC’ raincoat; mistakenly thinks jumbo jets were made for elephants when he tries to get a ticket on Sri Lankan Airlines; thinks photo booths should be made bigger if you want both ears in a passport shot; and gets into trouble over his love of bananas. There are also many visual laughs to be had, such as him attempting a selfie with his trunk, the incessant pursuit of the steaming monster crab and Trunk’s various dreams of glory as a footballer, space traveller or King-bearing elephant.
Janet learns as she sketches out the fascinating visual story line of the book just how important elephants are representing patience, wisdom and memory. It is said they help us find direction; with perfect memory handed down through the generations, the elephant knows its way around, always assessing how to find food and water, even in massive climatic changes, and how to protect the herd from attack by, for instance, walking miles around an area in which they sense poachers are operating. Through their ‘six’ senses, elephants negotiate with the world they live in, for example, by picking up vibrations in the air, on the ground and by knowing the calls and behaviours of other animals. They, in turn, pass messages on - using their feet they drum on the ground to send signals great distances. Currently, man’s lack of understanding of the importance of the natural world, of which we are all a part, has led to the elephant ‘corridors’, as they are called, being blocked by manmade structures, which has brought about a detachment from the natural path - this is a metaphor for the modern world we live in and needs to be addressed if we are to return to a more wholesome life. In the story, Donald embraces the bigger mission for him to redeem the fate of his heartlessly slaughtered ancestors in the high country, but is continually sidetracked by the promise of finding paradise on earth, from which he is relentlessly chased away by Crabzilla.
Crabzilla, although a monstrous scary character, was inspired by the BBC Blue Planet series that has connected us with the marine world hitherto beyond our understanding and reach. On his quest to track down Trunk, we are introduced to other cultures from which we can all learn. The crab, one of the 7 monsters in the eight part series, symbolises movements in a different direction to that which we are facing, but also the opportunity for renewal and rebirth through the shedding of their shells as they grow.
 These symbols represent an opportunity to get round the shadows in our lives. The crab is also seen as a talisman for protection, found at the bottom of the ocean, which signifies that we should look deep within ourselves to find our spiritual core and a new path.
The crab, with its oversize pincers, demands that we face our fears head on before it is too late and alter our behaviours to think bigger and better.
Using the symbolism in the paintings associated with animals, the Donald Trunk series takes our child into an imaginary world full of cultural knowledge and embraces how different people live their lives and learn ways in which we can reach a better place through humour, understanding and empathy for others as well as celebrating the world in which we live. Janet Anderton in this latest book to be launched on January 16, 2019 at The Jetwing Lighthouse Hotel Galle has brilliantly captured the humour and character of the rakish Crabzilla and Donald Trunk. Janet admitted to me, laughing as she did so, that she sometimes thinks she has become Trunk, as her bed disappears under a pile of elephant drawings for the books. The artist who hails from Bolton, a place that celebrates the importance of the elephant, having incorporated it on the coat of arms has a sister living in Sri Lanka and through her has learnt a great deal about this very special island that Anderton like so many others has totally fallen in love with. She received a B.A. in Fine Art from Loughborough Art College in 1985 and is famous for her paper cuts and collages using unloved books.
She puts every written page to good use and shows the importance of recycling, while impressing on the minds of children, the art and power of books. This allows children to live in the imaginary world and in the case of Donald Sri Lanka’s swimming elephant also learn about the incredible history of the island, which was as technically advanced as the ancient Greeks and Romans.
So go on join in the fun and book a ticket to a game changing event and learn first hand what really goes on behind the scenes of creating such a creative book at the fairy tale setting of the southern coastlines most beautiful hotel Jetwing Lighthouse.
