Kingsly H. Perera
A jovial individual
Kingsly H. Perera passed away after a brief illness on September 21 at Ratnapura. He was 87 years old when he died.
Kingsly and I joined the Department of Health as radiographers on July 1, 1953. We were together during our training period for one year at the General Hospital, Colombo.
Kingsly as I know him from 1953, was a carefree, jovial and a fun-loving person. Even while at work, he used to come and have short chats with us, cracking some joke which made us burst into laughter and have a short, but pleasant time.
His hobby was playing his electric guitar.
After the training at the General Hospital, Colombo, in 1953/1954, Kingsly was transferred to General Hospital, Ratnapura, from 1955. He returned to General Hospital, Colombo, in 1961 for the MSR training course wherein I met him again. We used to have some fun with Kingsly during the lunch interval as we were more busy with following lectures at other times.
After being successful at the MSR (Lond) Exam in November 1961, Kingsly went on transfer again to General Hospital, Ratnapura. He retired in 1985 and out of his total service period of 32 years, he was stationed at the Ratnapura chest clinic and at the General Hospital, Ratnapura, for about 30 years.
He had a great liking for Ratnapura, so much so he made Ratnapura his second home by renting a house belonging to the church and remaining in that house for quite a long time.
It was shocking and sad for Kingsly to lose his wife in the year 2000. In spite of this unbearable loss, Kingsly was courageous to remain in the rented house at Ratnapura. He was very much loved and cared for by his only son, Ravi, who took great pains to look after his loving father during his last years.
At the death of Kingsly, I lost a kind-hearted and loving friend with whom I communicated until his last moments.
I offer my deepest sympathy to Ravi at the loss of his loving father.
I wish Kingsly an everlasting rest in the arms of Jesus and may his soul rest in peace!
Your loving friend, Marshall Fernando
Cyril Abeysekera
A true gentleman
When the Society of Structural Engineers – Sri Lanka was formed in 1989, it had no stable home and no employees. It was only in 1994 that the Society was able to start to get away from its nomadic existence and also employ someone full-time to help the Executive Committee with its day-to-day administrative tasks. The person who took over this responsibility was Cyril Abeysekera.
He was the third of nine children born in Matale to a father who was a school principal and a mother who was a school teacher. His eldest brother was the distinguished public servant and civil rights activist, Charles Abeysekera. The second, Victor, was an executive in the Mahaweli Authority. The fourth, Leslie, was a High Court Judge. Another brother was an engineer and yet another worked for ESCAP in Bangkok. The youngest brother is a retired doctor in New York. It was, however, only Cyril who followed the lead given by his father by taking to teaching and also marrying a teacher, Pushpa de Silva.
He studied at St. Thomas’s College in Matale, St. Sylvester’s College in Kandy and also at Jaffna College, Vaddukkottai. He got a General Science degree from the University of Colombo, became a science teacher and was later a lecturer at the Maharagama Teachers’ Training College. He went on scholarship to Hiroshima in 1982 to learn about the latest methods in the teaching of science. Coincidentally, Pushpa’s brother had studied medicine in Hiroshima from 1954 to around 1962 before going on to the United States to become a successful Cardiologist in Chicago, where Cyril’s daughter Erandathi is also a doctor. His son Udula is a bank executive in Colombo. Cyril retired from government service in 1987 and worked thereafter at the Sri Lanka Association for the Advancement Science until 1994, when he joined the Society of Structural Engineers – Sri Lanka as its Administrative Officer. He retired in 2010.
During these 16 years, Cyril was a tower of strength to four Presidents, including the writer, Eng. A. D. Wickremasinghe, Eng. S. A. Karunaratne and Eng. D. A. Jayasinghe. After a few of years helping the Executive Committee to organise some excellent engineering seminars, Cyril himself took over most of the responsibility for the logistical side of these demanding events. All members of the Society held him in high regard. Cyril was one of the most honest and courteous persons the writer has ever had to deal with, not only at the Society but elsewhere in the wider world.
He has never been known to say a harsh word about anyone, however unpleasant or incompetent that person was. In fact, the writer’s only doubt about Cyril would be that it was not possible to discern whether he cared more for his family, his friends or his dogs! He died on the July 1, this year, aged 85 and will be long-missed by those who knew him as the most gentle of gentlemen.

M. H. M. Ashraff
A kind-hearted politician
Mohamed Hussain Mohamed Ashraff, a great and worthy son of the Eastern Province, was born in Sammanthurai. He was indeed not born with the proverbial silver spoon, but by the time of his untimely death, he had established himself as a silver lining in the politics of this country. Leaders are born everywhere in the world and the service rendered by them for the good of their community are many. Although such services are remembered by people now and then, all their names would not became historical.
Minister M. H. M. Ashraff's 17th year remembrance fell on September 16. During the short spell of half a dozen years, he was a Cabinet Minister, Member of Parliament and Sri Lanka Muslim Congress and National Unity Alliance Founder Leader.
While on his way to his native Ampara District, the Sri Lanka Air Force helicopter which he was travelling in crashed at Aranayake. It has been almost 17 years since he left us, but his supporters never forgot him.
Ashraff's qualities of leadership and his respect for bureaucracy developed loyalty and team spirit. Ashraff was a kind-hearted, sensitive and emotional personality, always with a smile and kind word to greet his staff, colleagues and supporters. He was a leader who wanted things done correctly and was a stickler for correct details.
Ashraff was a deeply religious man and would commence nothing without remembering the Almighty and seeking his guidance and blessings.
He played a constructive role to install the former President Chandrika Bandaranayake Kumaratunga Government. Ashraff will be long-remembered by every citizen of this country as he strengthened the hands of the former President in her efforts to find a meaningful solution to the ethnic conflict.
Ashraff saw as nobody did before him, the political potential of the Eastern Province with its predominant Muslim habitation. Before his advent, Muslim polticians aligned themselves to the two major political parties; the UNP and SLFP. He was no doubt permitted by the waves of radicalism then sweeping across the Islamic world and the growing power of the Arab States.
In 1974, Ashraff joined the Attorney General's Department as a State Counsel and worked there to get himself acquainted with the law to become a lawyer. He practiced in Kalmunai and Batticaloa.
He completed a Master's Degree in Law prior to becoming a senior Minister. He was then honoured with title President's Counsel.
Ashraff had almost the entire Muslim communtiy behind him. They appreciated his vision, sincerity and the immense sacrifices he made for their cause.
The late minister entered Parliament in 1989 through his then newly-formed Sri Lanka Muslim Congress. As the leader of the party, he extended his support to late President R. Premadasa, though he was in the opposition. He maintained a cordial relationship with the President to win back the rights of the Muslim community. He never tolerated injustice or discrimination.
The late minister appointed thousands of unemployed youth at the Colombo Harbour. But he included Sinhalese and the Tamils too in this drive. No Muslim leader will be cherished and remembered as Ashraff as he strove to get a Universtiy for Muslims. The South East University is the biggest achievement of the Muslim community.
In his heart of hearts, Ashraff was a poet. Sri Lanka made a poet a politician.

He was a loving father
Nearly three months have passed since the demise of my father at the age of 96, who spent the latter part of his life according to his wishes in his birthplace; Chunnakam East, Jaffna.
I have decided to pen some of the salient events that took place during his illustrious career and few of his admirable qualities because achievements of an officer and gentleman of such calibre, who served for a long period in Police Force without any blemish whatsoever, should go in records and be a good example for present-day Police officers.
My father commenced his career as constable in 1947 at the Bandarawella Police station after teaching for a short spell in Rakwana. Thereafter, he worked at various police stations, namely Diyatalawa, Badulla, Monaragala, Madulsima, Trincomalee, China Bay, Wellawatta and Bambalapitiya. Subsequently, in 1970, he was promoted to Sergeant and posted at Pettah. Afterwards, he was transferred to Mt. Lavinia and continued as a Court Sergeant. Consequently, he was attached to the ASP office in Dehiwala before his retirement in 1980, serving for 33 years in the Police force. Few contemporary high-calibre and well-respected officers whom I could remember, some of them who are no more, were Ana Seneviratne, Vamadevan and Ranmuthugala.
A noteworthy trait was his trilingual proficiency. This could be an ideal message to present day officials, for it contributes to the national policy towards building a united Sri Lanka. While working at Pettah, one German citizen had misplaced some important documents in Sri Lanka before his departure and this case was intimated to my father. Somehow, father was able to contact that foreigner and handed those documents to him at the airport. The foreigner wanted to compensate and father has had rejected it, as usual. Afterwards, this particular foreigner contacted the DIG and informed about this incident. My father was commended by the higher authorities. This is a lesson for junior Police officers and moreover, it demonstrates that if a person is very firm in his/her policies, no one can tarnish their image.
While on duty in the upcountry, the Police squad my father was a part of had come across a sambur in front of their jeep and the commanding officer (SI) had wanted to shoot it. Father advised the senior not to kill and this incident brought him praise from other police officers. This proved that he would never tolerate injustice and that he was strictly honest in every aspect.
At the Courts, he performed his duties exceptionally and received accolades from higher officials. At the time of his retirement, he received an 'Excellent Certificate' for his unblemished and dedicated services.
After retirement, he became a vegetarian and involved himself in Hindu religious activities in Trincomalee, while living with me for about 18 years when I was the Finance Director of the Provincial Treasury, EPC. He actively participated in numerous religious involvements, namely at the Koneswaram Temple, Muthukumaraswamy Temple and YMHA. He was offered the title 'Muuththa Othuwar (Senior songster)' and 'Sivanerith Thondar' at the felicitation ceremony held at Hindu college, Trincomalee, a few years back. Though we lost our mother during our schoolgoing days, he was our mentor and supported us wholeheartedly. He was a devoted husband to my beloved mother and a doting father to his children.
All the above merits are praiseworthy and we, as his children, adopted these principles. With regard to education, he enabled us to be educated in leading schools in Colombo. He was extremely proud of the achievements and careers of his grandchildren.
Thank you, father for giving us this wonderful life and for showing us the right path. Thank you for all the comfort and happiness you had brought into our life. There is no birth and there is no death for the Athma. The good deeds that we do go with us.
May his soul rest in peace with mother.
His eldest son,  T. Sivananthakumar (FCA)
