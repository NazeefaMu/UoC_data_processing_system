JO to file charges against Harrison to Bribery Commission

The Joint Opposition (JO) yesterday said they would complain to the Bribery and Corruption Commission about Rural Economic Affairs Minister P. Harrison that he allegedly caused a loss of Rs.10 billion to the state by releasing a stock of paddy to produce animal food
JO member MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage said the Paddy Marketing Board, which comes under the Rural Economic Affairs Ministry, had sold 200,000 MT of paddy at Rs. 24 per kilo to three private companies to produce animal food.
He charged that under minister's instructions, paddy had been sold at a price well below the market prices.
Aluthgamage addressing the media in Colombo said the JO will continue to expose corruption by government ministers and several other complaints against government politicians were in the pipeline.
