Vishva props up Cambrians

 The 67th Battle of the Golds between Prince of Wales College and St. Sebastians College came to a halt at 4 pm on day one at De Soysa Stadium Moratuwa due to bad weather.
Sebs skipper and Sri Lanka Under 19 player Mishen Silva called the coin correctly and invited his opposite number who is also an Under 19 player Vishva Chaturanga Peiris to take the strike early , but his gamble failed as Vishva and Sandun Fernando put on 100 runs for the first wicket.
At lunch Cambrians were 121 for 1 with Sandun Fernando scoring 26 runs.
After resuming Cambrians were all out for 230 runs exactly at 4 pm.
Vishva Chaturanga Peiris made the top score of 88 runs while Dilanka Maduranga and Sanjeeva Fernando scoring 32 and 24 runs respectively.
Another Sri lanka Under 19 Cap Praveen Jayawickrama was the most successful bowler for Sebs with 5 for 62 and Tharusha Fernando and Nuwanidu Fernando too claimed two wickets each.
