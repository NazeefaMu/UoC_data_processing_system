Sri Lanka participates in Montreal Int’l Tourism and Travel Show

Over 36,000 visitors walked the carpets of the 30th edition of the Montreal International Tourism & Travel Show in which the Sri Lanka High Commission in Ottawa, in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau, participated for the third consecutive year.
The event which took place from October 19 to 21 at Place Bonaventure in Montreal, attracted prospective travellers preparing for their trips, discovering new destinations and seeking expert advice on their future holiday destinations. More than one hundred countries were represented at the event through their tourism offices, tour operators and travel agents.
During the event, all visitors to the Sri Lanka booth were provided with maps of Sri Lanka and brochures. The Sri Lanka stall showcased tourist attractions, illustrating the rich cultural heritage, beautiful landscapes and wildlife and provided an ideal opportunity for prospective visitors to catch a glimpse of what Sri Lanka had to offer. Representatives of the Sri Lankan Tourism Industry from Sri Lanka and Toronto were also present at the event.
According to the Annual Statistical Report of the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority, around 46,896 Canadian tourists visited Sri Lanka in 2017, which is a 6% increase in the tourists’ arrivals from Canada to Sri Lanka. It is expected that Sri Lanka’s participation at this year’s Show would further enhance Sri Lanka’s tourism potential in the Canadian market.
