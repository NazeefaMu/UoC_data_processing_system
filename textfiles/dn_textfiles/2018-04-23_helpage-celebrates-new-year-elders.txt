HelpAge celebrates New Year with elders

Elders celebrated Avurudu with HelpAge at Dehiwala S. D. S. Jayasinghe Grounds recently. The event began around 9am with the participation of about 25 male and female elders. They were between the age group of 60 to 92 years from the H.P. Gooneratne HelpAge Day Centre, Ratmalana.
The elders were very keen to participate in traditional games such as marking the eye on elephant, breaking the pot by blind folded person, tug- of- war, bursting the balloon competition, passing the hat and the musical chair competition.
The festival was organized by HelpAge Sri Lanka (HASL) in par with its flagship programme of performing free cataract surgeries for underprivileged Senior Citizens at HelpAge Eye Hospital, Wellawatta.
HelpAge, Chairman Tilak de Zoysa and Council Member Nishantha Gooneratne were present on the occasion at the invitation of HelpAge Executive Director Samantha Liyanawaduge. HelpAge official Buddhika Nanayakkara organized the event.
