Sri islanders, natural talent and good genetics

2018 strides through oblivious of all things normal...as Augustus stands tall.
Traditionally accepted as the month of change...it gives rugby7s in Sri Lanka the best shot ever.
Essentially the comprehensive Asian 7s season opens with the Asian Games, followed by the Asian series....plus some additional tours as prep for our ranking tournaments.
Both Sri islanders men and women, get their annual opportunity to stamp their class and scale that elusive ladder for positions that muscle up our performance profile regionally.
The required level of conditioning is professional and intense...and little room for any options that constitutes luck or destiny.
The national selection led by Rohan Abeykoon need all their experience and acumen to get the player combination absolutely on the button.
I am a firm believer in specialists. matching skills, temperament, vision and instincts is a real balance and trusted value for players to rely on .
Muthutanthri will need solid options both in attack and defence ...but most significantly, players that are prepared to empty their tanks for our island flag.
The pure steel belief is hard to find and rare as platinum.
Danushka Ranjan, Sooriyabandara, Ratwatte, Naveen Heenakan, Jason Dassa, Ritchie Dharmapala, Anu Vilivera, Hirantha P, Anuradha Herath, Omalka Gunaratne, Gayan Weeraratne ...should be familiar faces that step up off the page at selection....experience, pace, understanding and a few magical skills too.
The 7s championship is harsh as it is relentless...so much hope slapped on the considerable shoulders.
Management must be able to clearly define the composition of our squad...we require the ability to match or better the lineup.
Japan, Hong Kong, Korea, possibly Malaysia will be the set up all through the series.
We need to mentally and physically match up and counter our opponents in all departments, that really make us cutting edge in the middle.
I am sure our resident experts are chewing their manicured nails about Sri 7s ability to deliver under pressure this season.
Let’s hope all the learning and meticulous work gives us dimension and venomous finishing.
The women will also be tested max ...and coach Sampath will need creative power to finish the job we started 5 years ago.
Japan, Hong Kong, Kazakhstan and Thailand stand between us and an elusive medal grab...it’s plenty history already, and time to deliver.
The required standard of clinical pace and finishing...Absolute priorities for team selection.
Ayesha Perry Perera, Randika Sambu, Sanju Wijeytilake, Anusha Attanayake, Munasinghe, Shani Madu, and the vast experience of Thanuja Weerakody ...fundamental to consistency this compulsive 2018.
Magical if they grab a medal when Sri Lanka Rugby host the final deciding leg in November.
Colombo 7s flagship arena ...the international Racecourse dressing up as our gracious host for the keenly anticipated ARFU season ender.
Grand news for new President Bonsa, deputy Dida Illyas and Nazeem Mohammed...to hit this 7s plan with gusto and pure belief.
Anything short of that is hard to absorb.
What a fabulous start for the new head executive committee at Sri Lanka Rugby to kick off their official ambitions.
Sevens U20, and U18 add to the scintillating possibilities this season....and not much doubt about being Asian champions again at both levels.
A repeat much desired and complete justice to our amazing and provocative natural schoolboy talent that makes our islanders paradise...phenomenal.
May Augustus herald and hail our best 7s season ever.
Be proud Sri rugby hearts ...it’s time to stamp our class in Asia.
Bula bula Sri Api!
