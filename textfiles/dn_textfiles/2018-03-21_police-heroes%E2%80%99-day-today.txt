Police Heroes’ Day today

Sri Lanka Police will celebrate Police Heroes’ Day today (21) to commemorate fallen Police heroes who valiantly sacrificed their lives over a period of 154 years in order to protect and preserve the lives and properties of Sri Lankan citizens.
Police Constable Sabhan succumbed to his injuries sustained by a gunshot fired by an accompalice of Saradiyel named Mammale Marikkar
on March 21,1864, in the Utuwankanda area at Mawanella, Kegalle District. This was during a mission to apprehend a bandit named Deekiri Kewage Saradiyel.
Based on this incident, which took the life of Police Constable Sabhan, March 21 each year has been designated as the Police Heroes’ Day.
Three thousand one hundred and eighteen Police officers of various ranks have sacrificed their lives over the years.
A special ceremony under the auspicies of Inspector General of Police Pujith Jayasundera with the participation of family members of Police heroes will be held at 8.00 am at the Police Heroes Memorial Monument at Field Force Headquarters, Bambalapitiya today.
Concurrent with this ceremony, a number of commemorative ceremonies will be held at Divisional level islandwide.
