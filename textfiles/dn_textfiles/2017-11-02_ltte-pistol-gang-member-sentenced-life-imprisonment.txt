LTTE pistol gang member sentenced to life imprisonment

A former LTTE pistol gang member was yesterday sentenced to life imprisonment by the Colombo High Court for committing the murder of former Dehiwala Intelligence Unit OIC Sunil Thabrew in 2003.
While handing out a judgement against the accused Sellathurai Kirupakaran, High Court Judge Piyasena Ranasinghe observed that the prosecution has proved the accused is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
The accused was further ordered to pay a compensation of Rs.25,000 for the possession of five live bullets.
On June 23, Dehiwala Intelligence Unit OIC IP Sunil Thabrew was shot dead in his quarters at Dehiwela Police by an LTTE pistol gang member. The accused, Sellathurai Kirupakaran alias Madan, was arrested by the police when he attempted to flee the area. The Attorney General had indicted the accused under the Prevention of Terrorism Act on three counts.
