That little blighter in a diaper is a love sniper!

Tuesday the 14 was V-Day. And the cash registers have been jingling incessantly throughout the whole of the last few weeks. For days tainted by commercialism Valentine’s Day gives even Christmas a run for its money - big money. It is heralded with a superfluity of marketing initiatives by cunning companies to cash in on the general emotional cupidity and stupidity on display.
That is why on V-Day you observe a great deal of people walking around feeling light-headed and full of love. Yes siree, Stupid Cupid’s arrows seem to be sending everyone quivering into a trance in romance.
The greeting card industry, florists, jewellers, confectioners and restaurateurs rake in over a billion bucks during V-Day every year. Now, do not get me wrong, I am not against romance. I think romance is an important part of the man-woman relationship. Yet, throughout the years I have found that there are many different types of romance, and it doesn’t necessarily involve flowers, chocolates and lacy heart-shaped cards.
Often it appears in the smallest of actions and in the simple, quiet moments of everyday life. I would choose comfort, security and old-fashioned loving devotion over wildly romantic encounters any day of the week. All you florists, confectioners, perfume dealers and card vendors are welcome to send your hate-mail to me.
But before that cherubic, chubby imp starts hitching up his diapers, ruffling his wings and stringing his bow, it would be a good idea to get ready to run. That is because Cupid’s arrows have been known to have caused mischief and mayhem from the time his darts drove Daphne away from Apollo.
lethal weapons
Yes, Stupid Cupid often gets it wrong. It seems pretty obvious that the little blighter in a diaper has a capricious disposition and I suspect a malicious streak as well. His arrows are lethal weapons to the lovelorn and he sometimes uses them willy-nilly. In this day and age he terrorises a good many hearts.
The rascally son of Venus could bar adults - and by adults I mean parents and teachers - from making children swap Valentines. What the heck are they trying to do with these very small kids anyway? Aiming to churn out whole generations of ‘Valen-tinies,’I guess.
Besides, think about some of the incurably romantic oldsters? They would be spared a world of grief when they are pierced broadside and the feelings are un-mutually one-sided. Sometimes plot does not always race at a pace that suggests love is just about the only force that keeps the universe moving with ever-palpitating geriatric hearts.
But then again the arrow picked from his frivolous quiver may not be the appropriate one. To be sure the missile does not always keep to the straight and narrow. It flies awry often. To add to the confusion the arch little archer does not always hit dead centre.
All the while, many of us are ducking and dodging the arrows from the sniping scallywag’s bow. Personally, I think this urchin dressed only in a diaper, flying around blindfolded and shooting arrows at folks, is just plain dangerous. Oh sure, it may seem like fun and games, until somebody gets an eye or both eyes put out!
hackneyed cliché
And then everybody invariably spews out the hackneyed cliché that ‘love is blind.’ Philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche appeared dead on target when he weighed in with this twist on the old ‘so ugly’ joke with: “A pair of powerful spectacles has sometimes sufficed to cure a person in love.”
For example, Plato, the ancient Greek philosopher and bon vivant, let it rip from the hip when he said: “Love is a serious mental disease.” But for true V-Day Day cynicism, you have got to go straight to the early 19th century American man of letters, H. L. Mencken who said: “Love is the triumph of imagination over intelligence,” adding: “Love is like war, easy to begin but very hard to stop.”
Satire columns
And ouch! There’s this witty love tap from British writer W. Somerset Maugham: “Love is only a dirty trick played on us to achieve continuation of the species.” Mencken, Maugham and Nietzsche, these are gentlemen who, history has shown, did not do particularly well on Valentine’s Day. But closer home there was myold friend and former schoolmate nicknamed Surchepps, who I have deservingly immortalised in many of my satire columns.
He was an inveterate punster and a darned good one at that. As an alumni of St. Ben’s he had a sort of paradoxical rivalry with a pretty, witty Shepherdian, in the convent next door. Her name was Mercy, although she never lived up to her name when crossing swords in any verbal battle.
Surchepps conceded that Mercy was his most worthy and versatile opponent when it came to the art of repartee. At a social gathering once we matched Surchepps with Mercy in a fun debate on love that called for insults in rhyming couplets. I was voted unanimously as moderator and set out the rules which decidedly forbade profanity of any kind. Surchepps won the coin toss and fired the first volley: “Of loving beauty you float with grace. If only you would hide your face.” Mercy returned fire: “I want to feel your sweet embrace. But leave that paper bag on your face.”
And so the battle went into a full-scale punny rhythmic war. Surchepps: “Kind, intelligent, loving and hot. This describes what you are not!” Mercy: “I like your smile, your face, your eyes. And I’m really good at telling lies.” Surchepps: “Violets are blue, roses are red. I hate your guts and I wish you were dead!” Mercy: “I see your face when I am dreaming. That’s why I always wake up screaming!”
As moderator I had to step in and cry halt to the debate when I observed it was going too far. Surchepps: “My feelings for you no words can tell. Except for maybe go to hell!” Mercy: “Violets are blue, roses are red. Shame, your backside is the size of a shed!”
Happy belated Valentine’s Day everybody!
