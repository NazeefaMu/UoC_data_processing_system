Helping hand for potato farmers

The All Ceylon Consumers Co-operative Federation (COOPFED) would assist potato farmers by purchasing 200 tonnes of potato at Rs.95 per kilo daily, from September 21, Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister Ravindra Samaraweera said.
He was addressing the media at his ministry on Tuesday, to discuss and find solutions to problems faced by potato farmers.
Minister Samaraweera said potatoes grown by farmers in Welimada and Uva Paranagama usually reached the market between September and December.
According to reports, the stocks reaching the market roughly included 4,000 metric tonnes in September, 13,000 metric tonnes in October, 8,000 metric tonnes in November and 4,000 metric tonnes in December.
Minister Samaraweera said earlier, he proposed a levy on imported potatoes to protect local farmers, and that the Cost of Living Committee decided on a tax of Rs.40 per kilo.
When the local crop was harvested in September, the price of potatoes recorded a sharp drop to Rs.60 per kilo, leading to protests by local farmers. Although they requested the imposition of a Rs.10 tax on imported potatoes, they found that traders who had already completed imports would also add the tax to their sales and hence, had to drop the idea.
An arrangement made with the Cooperative Wholesale Establishment (CWE) to purchase local produce also failed as the CWE had certain limitations on purchases.
After discussions with the Department of Cooperatives, COOPFED, Keells, Cargills Food City and Arpico, they agreed to purchase a small amount of potatoes at Rs.100 per kilo.
At the discussion, COOPFED agreed to purchase potato stocks, if they were provided with the necessary facilities. Now, COOPFED would purchase 200 metric tonnes of potatoes daily, six days a week. As COOPFED had asked for storage facilities, the ministry had arranged them free of change, Minister Samaraweera said. He said in future, they would hold discussions with the Finance, Agriculture and Trade Ministries to prevent the unlimited import of potatoes, and ensure that imports are limited to bridge the gap between demand and produce.
It was also decided to take measures to assist local farmers to reduce their production costs. State Disaster Management Ministry Secretary Kapila Jayasekara, Badulla Government Agent Damayanthi Paranagama, as well as representatives of the Cooperative Development Department, COOPFED, Cargills, Keells, Arpico, and the Potato Farmers’ Association were present.
