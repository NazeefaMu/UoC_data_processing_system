‘Anti-dumping Bill will be soon in Parliament’

"We are planning to present the draft Anti-dumping Bill to the Parliament very soon. Sri Lankan industries were assured that the FTAs being mooted will not affect them nor will it result in an imports dump that the domestic manufacturers are fearful of. In fact, the much sought after anti-dumping legislation was cleared by the Attorney General and is ready to head to the legislature,” Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen said.
He was addressing the 26th AGM of Industry Association of Sri Lanka (IASL) at the Cinnamon Grand in Colombo on September 27.
“Industries operate in challenging environments but with the help of Government agencies including the Trade Ministry, some of these were overcome,” IASL Chairman Dinesh Dharmadasa said.
“FTAs to be signed by Sri Lanka could bring forth numerous new challenges. We thank the Government for starting a dialogue with the industries and hope these dialogues will continue to facilitate viable operations of Sri Lankan Industries once the FTAs are signed and open up new opportunities for our members," he said.
He said any further liberation of trade has to be done after few basic safeguards like Anti-dumping legislation and lowering of duties of raw materials for local manufacture of finished products. Minister Bathiudeen said the industries in the country appeared to be worried about impacts of FTAs and dumping. "The unity government will not enter into such agreements without consulting local industries and without protecting them first. We are looking at new steps on anti-dumping and my officials are studying issues on this avenue. The Department of Commerce is a key institution working in this regard. We are planning to present the draft Anti-dumping Bill to Parliament in two-three weeks," he said.
