Cabinet approves Super Critical Coal for Sri Lanka

A policy paper detailing the energy mix for electricity generation which was approved by Cabinet this week calls for the use of clean coal technologies using super critical or ultra-super critical coal.
Coal remains the best least cost electricity generation option, according to energy sector ecperts.
“As coal power remains the least cost option, it has been decided that coal power should be there in the energy mix of the country,” the Cabinet paper no 21/2018/PE goes on to state. “Since environmental conservation is a prime policy, it has been proposed to employ clean coal technologies using super critical or ultra-super critical coal.”
The Cabinet has decided that 30 percent of Sri Lanka electricity generation will be sourced from Liquefied Natural Gas, another 30 percent by high-efficient coal power, 25 percent by large hydro, 15 percent from furnace oil and non-conventional renewable energy sources which can be used for firm power.
The Cabinet paper however does not detail the megawatt which would encompass the percentages given. The Joint Cabinet Memorandum submitted by the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry and the Special Assignments Ministry also cites that the Power Ministry has submitted a report to the National Economic Council in April stressing that the powers for preparing policies for the electricity sector be vested with the relevant minister and the Cabinet only.
