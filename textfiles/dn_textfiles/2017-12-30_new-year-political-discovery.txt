A New Year of  political discovery

The fast approaching New Year will bring the most rivalrous political contest in the country since the campaign from November 2014 and the Presidential Election in January 2015. The present national leaders and the country’s leader in the immediate past are contestants in a campaign of national importance for the control of local government bodies in the country, which would lead to the larger scope of national politics in the coming years.
While the celebrations of Christmas and New Year would have pushed the campaigns back a little, they will emerge with colour and commitment displaying the realities of political conflict in the country, largely on the basis of the rivalry and differences between and among political parties, and regrettably with little purpose for the needs of the people who comprise the vast electorate.
As the rival parties make their initial moves in the campaign, many observers see that the thousands of candidates contesting for the many thousand seats in local bodies in the country have very few policies or concepts of service for the people through effective local government; but will campaign to show which party in the fray is the most popular. This applies mainly in the seven provinces outside the North and East, although even in those two provinces too, the play of the party and the politician is clearly of more importance than service to the people.
As the drum beat of politics takes more importance than the rhythm of service, we are seeing an increasing rivalry between the official SLFP led by President Maithripala Sirisena, and the lotus bud SLPP effectively led by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, which is clearly showing a campaign for the control of the SLFP or Blue voters in the country, much more than any policies with regard to local government.
This is certainly posing major questions to the strength and policy formulations of the coalition of unity that controls the Central Government, with attempts by the SLFP members in key positions in government seeking to move away from their coalition ally – the UNP, in moves that seek to give more support to the SLPP and the leadership of Mahinda Rajapaksa.
The contradictory position of President Sirisena being the leader of the SLFP that is openly challenging the national leader he defeated, largely with UNP support, in January 2015, and the failure of efforts by President Sirisena and his SLFP Ministers in the coalition of unity to achieve any understanding with the SLPP and the Joint Opposition (JO) that is its main political front, have certainly placed the government in a visibly shaky position – because of threats to the continued unity between the UNP and SLFP in the coalition of unity in governance. The emerging campaign rhetoric of the formal (pro-Sirisena) SLFP that is hugely anti-UNP, with the identification of the UNP as the ‘Common Enemy' going back to the traditional rivalries of the past, and the allegations of corruption, especially with the Central Bank and Treasury bond issues, certainly places the unity government in a shaky position as the campaign gets hotter.
More to follow
The release of the Presidential Commission Report on the Treasury bond issues will certainly be a major campaign issue in an election said to be concerned with local government and not Treasury bonds. The findings of the Commission, if in keeping with or even more than the evidence led before it, will certainly be a major concern for the UNP, with issues of conflict of interest and individual and official corruption already exposed, placing it in a situation that needs a big fight back. The reality is that both the SLFP and the SLPP will be making capital of this in the poll campaign, with the belief that the maximum distance from the UNP in this situation is the best for both parties- for Maithripala Sirisena and Mahinda Rajapaksa.
After the efforts to have some unity between the SLFP and SLPP in the campaign having failed, the SLFP leaders are now talking about a unity of purpose, of forming alliances with the SLPP where there is such possibility the post-election situation. This will of course depend on how strong either party performs in the election. As the campaign moves on the ‘common enemy’ strategy against the UNP will have to be pushed back by both Blues, because it will almost lead to an infighting on a single slogan, which ultimately helps the UNP.
It is necessary to record here that many of the SLFP leaders who are trying their best to distance themselves from the UNP today, who are trying to distance themselves from the ‘common enemy’ – UNP, were those who crept back to the political and government leadership of Maithripala Sirisena, after the August 2015 General Election, and many of them were also defeated in the polls but came in as Nominated MPs who did not have the mandate of the people.
There present political strategies are decidedly shameless, when considering the fact that Maithripala Sirisena’s election as Executive President, defeating Mahinda Rajapaksa, was entirely due to the block UNP vote in January 2015, and their creeping in also followed the majority of 105 seats the UNP won in August 2015. This shameless politics of the position and power hunters is showing the depths to which Sri Lankan politics has descended in the last few decades, and especially in and after the Rajapaksa Regime, and will need much more than a huge local government election in the current context and strategies for politics in Sri Lanka to be concerned with issues and not people and power.
While the opposition to the UNP will be the key aspect of political rivalry in the coming month of campaigning, those who make increasing noise against the UNP should also understand that the SLFP and SLPP (plus JO) will not be able to form a government, that can have more parliamentary seats than the UNP and its allies – such as the TNA and some Muslim political parties.
The UNP thus moves into this campaign as the strongest political party, with its Green Flag having unbroken support among its membership throughout the country, and will remain undivided, especially in the context of being the strong part of a coalition government, and holding the key portfolios, after more than two decades of being out of power.
Despite the many disadvantages on corruption, especially on the Treasury bond issues, and possibly with a new Presidential Commission to probe the failures of SriLankan Airways, the nature of politics in the country today, with power preceding policy, and the crooked nature of governance dominating the political system, certainly places the UNP at a major advantage in a political system that is not emphasizing on the fight against corruption, but more on the power of party and personality, which pays little attention to a policy of service to the people. This is not the best situation for the UNP to be in, but it is the reality of the politics of today, which will need much more than a hugely manipulated local government poll to resolve.
The way forward
The coming local government poll has certainly moved to become an election of national importance, as it comes at almost the middle of the current government’s term. It will make a major contribution to give an indication of how far the present coalition of unity could go in the coming years. It will also be an indicator of the future political strategies of President Maithripala Sirisena, who on the day of his swearing in said this would be his only term in the Presidency, the key dictatorial conditions of which he would remove. Some of that has been done, but there is much more needed, which will need constitutional changes, which are not the highlight of today.
It is also an election that will be of importance in future policies of the UNP, the role of its leader Ranil Wickremesinghe, and its commitment to the policies of “liberal democracy” which is being strongly criticized as being much more pro-capitalism and very little by way of liberalism. It is also an election that will show what opportunities Ranil Wickremesinghe may have in a campaign for an Executive Presidency. It is also a poll that will show how far the Rajapaksa name has been weakened or strengthen in the politics of the country, and whether Mahinda Rajapaksa could move to be the next Prime Minister, and if so who would be the President he would have to serve under.
All this is the unknown politics of the future, and more importantly the realities of politics that the people of Sri Lanka would have to face up to in the coming months and years. It is a local government poll that is flying many kites in the emerging strong winds of rival politics, and hopefully policies, too. It will be a New Year of political discovery.
