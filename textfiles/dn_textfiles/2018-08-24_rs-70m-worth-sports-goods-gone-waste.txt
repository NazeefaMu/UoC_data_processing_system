Sports Minister labels it a “national disaster”
Rs. 70m worth sports goods gone waste

Over Rs. 70 million in public funds has been squandered by Sports Ministry officials prompting the Minster of Sports Faiszer Mustapha to label it a "national disaster".
Without a proper warehouse the Rs. 70 million wastage has been attributed to a huge heap of sports goods that was lying idle, damaged and spoiled.
Minister Mustapha said he requested the ministry auditor to take stock of the count and distribute the equipment to under privileged schools within the next three weeks.
Most of the equipment meant for cricket, badminton, football and gymnastics are not in a state fit for usage.
"I will conduct a proper investigation into this. I want to set up a system and most of the ministry officials will not like this. These are public funds gone waste and some officials will have to answer for this," the Minister said.

Sports goods lying idle, damaged and spoilt.
According to storekeeper HW Rohitha the sports goods mostly for cricket, basketball, were lying in their unloaded containers for more than two years due to lack of space in the sports development building.
He said he brought the matter to the ministry officials but nothing was done.
Most of the items were at the mercy of the elements with rain water taking a heavy toll.
Minister Mustapha was also displeased to learn that the Torrington sports complex had limited toilet facilities.
Apart from the sports gears there are 405 carrom boards that are almost rotting each with a cost of Rs.35,000 made in India.
Minister of Sports inspected the sports gears along with ministry officials.
