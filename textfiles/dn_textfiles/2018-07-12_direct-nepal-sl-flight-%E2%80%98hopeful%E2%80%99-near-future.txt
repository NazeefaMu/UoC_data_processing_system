Direct Nepal-SL flight ‘hopeful’ in the near future

Nepal will re look at launching direct flights to Colombo once again said the Ambassador of Nepal, Professor Bishwambher Pyakurya.
Speaking to Daily News Business at the Sri Lanka-Nepal Friendship and Business Council networking event under the title, “Foreign Investment Opportunities in Nepal,” in Colombo he said that this matter is discussed once again.
“The air link between Colombo and Kathmandu had previously been tried by Himalayan Airlines but was discontinued after flights reached only 40% capacity.”
Whether or not a direct flight between Kathmandu and Colombo would be established in the near future were also the most pertinent questions of the evening.
Many at the event and senior officials from the tourism industry in Nepal and Sri Lanka made the point that both countries could capitalize on their tourist seasons, which flow into one another.
“Tourists migrate towards the cooler climates of Nepal and the Himalayas in the summers, but the season abruptly ends in the fall.”
A direct flight between Kathmandu and Colombo may be more viable with a stopover in an Indian destination to increase capacity a participant said.
The evening also focused on strengthening economic ties between Sri Lanka and Nepal through infrastructure, energy, and tourism.
The four-member panel at the event included President of the Sri Lanka Nepal Council Jagath Savanadasa, Professor of Economics at the University of Colombo Dr. Sirimal Abeyratne, and President of SL’s Chamber of Commerce and Industry Ruwan Edirisinghe.
