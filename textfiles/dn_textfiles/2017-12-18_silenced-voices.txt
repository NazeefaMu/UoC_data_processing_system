Silenced voices

Most of the women who have ever lived left no trace of their existence on the record of history. In sixteenth-century Europe, it is likely that no more than 5 per cent of women – at most – were literate; ordinary women left no letters, diaries, or notebooks in which they expressed what they felt or thought. For us, their voices are silent.
From the mid-1530s, and especially from the 1550s, ordinary women and men in France started converting, in ever increasing numbers, to Calvinism. The Calvinists rejected the authority of the Pope, abhorred the Catholic Mass, and deplored what they saw as the corruption, hypocrisy, and idolatry of the Roman Church. Their Catholic enemies mocked them with the name “Huguenots”.
Civil matters
Protestantism spread fast in the south of France, especially in the Languedoc. In Nîmes, 8,000 people – roughly two-thirds of the population – gathered in 1561 to hear the famous Protestant cleric, Pierre Viret, preach. By the end of that year, some 50 per cent of Nîmes’s population had converted to Calvinism. These recruits included the local elite. By early 1562, 60 per cent of the twenty-six judges of the city’s présidial court (which had jurisdiction over minor criminal and civil matters) were Protestant, and, by 1563, Huguenots dominated the town council.
Such Calvinist popularity was not unique in the Midi. In Toulouse, it is estimated that one-seventh of the 35,000-strong population were Huguenot by 1562 – but that number would soon decline rapidly. The reason for this reversal was that, after Catherine de’Medici’s granting of legal toleration to Protestantism in January 1562, a confrontation between the Catholic nobleman François, duc de Guise, and a group of Protestant worshippers inside the walls of the small town of Vassy on March 1, 1562 ended in the death of fifty people.
The massacre marked the first turn of the cycle of the deadly religious wars that would recur repeatedly across France over the next four decades. The worst incident of the wars was the St Bartholomew’s Day Massacre of August 24, 1572, in which Catholics killed 3,000 Protestants in Paris, and another 7,000 across France, in episodes of brutal, sickening violence, over the space of four days. Understandably, many former Protestants apostatized.
Seized control
But in the south, certain cities retained their Calvinism, among them Nîmes and Montauban. In Nîmes, when a massacre occurred in 1567, it was of Catholics by Protestants. On September 30, the Nîmois Protestants seized control of the city gates, shouting “Kill! Kill the papists! New world!”; imprisoned all the leading Catholics; and slaughtered at least a hundred of them, leaving their bloody corpses to rot in the well at the bishop’s palace. Given the relative populations of the cities of Nîmes and Paris, this was proportionately nearly as bloody as the events of 1572. Full control of the city – town council, consuls and court – moved firmly into Protestant hands.
Surrounded by, and regularly under attack from, Catholic forces, the rebel Protestant cities tried to survive with their religion intact in a hostile world.
The chief way that inhabitants sought to distinguish themselves from their Catholic enemies and protect themselves from the wrath of God was to adhere to a strict moral code. In areas where Protestant power was at its strongest, therefore, the Calvinists established a mechanism for the imposition of morality, and for disciplinary action in the case of failure: the consistory, a form of church court. Although the consistories also functioned as the governing bodies and welfare centres for the local churches, the vast majority of their time was absorbed in moral supervision, interrogation and reprimand.
Each consistory consisted of around ten to eighteen men – ministers, elders, deacons and a scribe – who met frequently: in Nîmes, they gathered fifty-six times a year. The consistory’s elders were charged with policing a handful of local streets and reporting any wrongdoing to the panel. Routine gossip was carefully investigated. Every indiscretion was recorded. Anyone guilty of the slightest impropriety could expect to be summoned before these self-appointed arbiters of morality.
Public reparation
The immoral were punished through a graduated series of shaming penalties, from private admonition, public reparation before the congregation, temporary suspension from the Eucharist, and, for the obstinately recalcitrant, permanent excommunication. These may seem light by comparison to contemporary criminal sentences, which were generally corporal or capital – but evidence tells against this understanding.
Repentance entailed a display of humility that compromised personal honour and was consequently dreaded. When a butcher, Jehan Mingaud, confessed his adultery with Suzanne Bertrande to the consistory in Nîmes in 1589 and was ordered to repent before the whole church the following Sunday, he protested that the consistory was being “too severe against him” and that he would “prefer to suffer death immediately than make the said public reparation”.
This form of punishment actually aped sentences dealt out by the criminal courts. In Montauban, the register of criminal sentences pronounced by the consuls of the town indicates that secular justice also punished fornicators by the “amande honorable la torche au poing a genoulx” – that is, a public apology traditionally made in a church by an offender on his or her knees, holding a torch in one hand, in a state of undress, and with a rope around his or her neck. In addition, the church and civic authorities clearly worked together. A surviving register of criminal sentences for Montauban shows cases of paillardise (fornication; from the French paille for hay, as in “rolling in the hay”) appearing in both that register and the consistorial records: some offenders were being punished twice.
The upshot of this rigour is a series of consistorial records full of interrogations of the guilty, the innocent and the witnesses, which have survived to this day. I have studied thirty-five volumes of consistorial deliberations – some 8,728 pages – from ten cities and towns in the Languedoc between 1560 and 1615.
Consistorial registers
The major series are the consistorial records of Nîmes, which are not only some of the best surviving collection of consistorial registers in existence, but among the best records of the way common people lived their lives in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Europe. These registers rival better-known surviving court and inquisitorial records – such as those from the medieval French village of Montaillou, about which Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie wrote – in richness and insight. Yet, as a body of evidence, historians have neglected them: I am the third historian to read these manuscripts, the second to do so at any length, and the first to use them to explore the lives of ordinary people, and, above all, women.
Women were thought to be primarily responsible for sexual and other sins, so controlling morals meant controlling women. This means that the registers include over a thousand testimonies by and about women, most of whom could not write and left no other record to posterity. In responding to charges of sin or in testifying against others, women offered descriptions of their daily lives, and justifications for their behaviour.
