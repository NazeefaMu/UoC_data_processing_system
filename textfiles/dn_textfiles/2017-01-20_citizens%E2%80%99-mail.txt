Citizens’ Mail

Before you settle the electricity bill
It is very important to advise customers as regards settlement of bills on time to avoid disconnection. It is better to give modified information on the reverse of the statement.
a) All cheques should be written in favour of “People's Bank – 0/A Ceylon Electricity Board” duly crossed Account Payee only.
b) Electricity Board will not take responsibility in case of postal remittance lost or delayed. It is better to send by registered post or direct hand delivery duly entered in a book for acknowledgement.
It has been stated that in the event of cheque being defaulted and returned supply could be disconnected without any notice. However if the customer has paid on time, though the cheque is returned due to some technical error (need not be due to lack of funds always) he still has time to settle his dues by cash, if advised early. Therefore notice of disconnection or any other information should be sent to the consumer as he has time to settle. Electricity Board should develop this culture.
Bankers also should have the courtesy to inform the customer in case the cheque tendered in settlement of statutory dues (Income Tax, Rates and Taxes etc.) is returned.
It is high time for everybody to adopt courteous approach towards settlement of statutory dues.
