Indian Premier’s speech at Norwood indirectly supports separatism: NUTA

The National University Lecturers’ Association in a press release issued yesterday said it considered the speech delivered by visiting Indian Prime Minister Nardera Modi at Norwood, Hatton as a prop to separatism in the country.
The media release issued by Association General Secretary Dr. Channa Jayasumana said.
The inference made by Modi that the Plantation Tamil Community in Sri Lanka were upholding Indian culture would dissuade the community from integrating into Sri Lankan culture.
Maintenance of an Indian culture in Sri Lanka was contradictory to the reconciliation policy of the Sri Lanka government.
It was also wrong on the part of Modi to describe plantation Tamils of Indian origin as part of an Indian diaspora. This would create a wrong mentality among up country plantation Tamils, who are citizens of Sri Lanka rather than part of an Indian diaspora.
What could be elicited from Modi’s entire speech is that he considered plantation Tamils in Sri Lanka s a community in another Indian state rather than a community in a neighbouring state.
The association considered, therefore, the Modi’s speech as an attempt to sow the seeds of another separatist movement in Sri Lanka.
Northern terrorist outfits created by Indian Politics and secret services caused immense destruction to the lives of people of all communities in the country and vital national assets.
It was the duty of all to ensure that a repetition of such destruction was not caused in the hill country, the press release said.
