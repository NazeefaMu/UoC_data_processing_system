Rajans recover from poor start to beat Vidyartha

At Nittawela yesterday a good game of rugby was witnessed between Dharmaraja College and Vidyartha College in their Plate trophy second round match. Dharmaraja beat Vidyartha after a poor first half by 36 points (3 goals, 3 tries) to 16 (1 goal, 3 penalties).
Vidyartha who are playing in the top division after five long years fared creditably in holding the powerful Rajans side playing some good rugby. Vidyartha led 9-7 at half time.
After the breather the rains came down and Rajans played better and made Vidyartha defend. Rajans were well served by their forwards to the three-quarter line, and they pressed strongly in the second half.
Vidyartha failed to play the same game as in the first half and Rajans using their knowledge scored the points to turn the game in their favour. Referee: Nalin Lasantha
Thurstan trounce St Sylvester’s
Thurstan College trounced St. Sylvester’s College by 35 points (3 goals, 1 try, 2 penalties, 1 drop goal) to 10 (1 goal, 1 penalty) in their Bowl trophy rugby match played at Pallekelle rugby grounds on Saturday. At the end of the first half Thurstan led 18-10.
Thurstan ruggerites gave a good display of rugby dominating in forward and three quarter play.
In the second half Sylvestrians tried hard to score but were held down. The feature of this half was good touch finding by Thurstan. The home team was on the defensive for most of the game. There was no scoring from the Sylvestrians in the second half.
Referee: Deepal Punyawardene.
