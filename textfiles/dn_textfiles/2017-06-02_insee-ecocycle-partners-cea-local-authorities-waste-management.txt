INSEE Ecocycle partners CEA, local  authorities in waste management

The total municipal solid waste (MSW) generation in the country is estimated at 6,500 metric tons (MT) per day.
INSEE Ecocycle, the waste management arm of INSEE Cement, has spearheaded a well-structured public-private partnership (PPP) for municipal solid waste management in co-processing 'segregated non-recyclable plastic, polythene waste from MSW' since 2014 in Gampaha and Kurunegala districts.
The partnership has demonstrated how the combined strengths of proactive private entities, the Central Environmental Authority (CEA), Office of the Commissioner of the Western Province and participating municipal councils can join forces with a private group to launch sustainable projects.
Prof. Lal Mervin Dharmasiri, CEA Chairman, said “Ecocycle supported the national initiative of eradicating plastic, polythene waste and e-waste in Gampaha, Kurunegala and Puttalam districts together with the CEA in 2016. We appreciate the support extended by them to CEA."
Sanjeewa Chulakumara, General Manager of INSEE Ecocycle, said “We are very happy to partner in solving the national issue via public-private partnership. It is a very successful showcase when we look back after five years of all our efforts.” Chandrani Samarakoon, Provincial Commissioner of the Western Province said, "Having understood the systematic and professional processes of INSEE Ecocycle, local government department carried out a series of joint awareness sessions together with the support of INSEE Cement, in order to ensure waste segregation at local authority level, which became a reality.”
Director of Waste Management Authority (WMA) Nalin Mannaperuma said, “WMA gives utmost importance in inculcating the mindset and establishing the ‘Polluter Pay Principle’ amongst all sectors. Persuading someone to pay for his or her own waste is a challenge as we have the option of free dumping or burning. We appreciate INSEE Ecocycle for stepping forward to establish waste management practices for the corporates.”
