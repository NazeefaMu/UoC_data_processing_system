Nostalgic notes

Her name is among some of the greatest musicians in the world. For someone who had benefited from the program initiated by the Princess Grace of Monaco which allowed talented children to receive music lessons Shani Diluka has come far on a less trodden path to set her mark in the global music arena. Applause, awards and prizes, she has won all these by excelling in piano forte. Music has also found her the perfect partner in Gabriel Le Magadure, an award winning French violinist who is a part of a very famous classical quartet called Quatuor Ebene.
Shani the musician vs Shani the wife
Shani is a person who is always curious and very open to the world. She is passionate in her personal life as well as with her music. I think she is the same on stage and in life: generous and always looking into the best of everything. That is why she has become one of the greatest pianist of her generation, performing all over the world - in Japan, Russia, Germany, Italy, Austria, etc. , collaborating with great people and passionate about sharing her art.
The meeting
We met in Bilbao for the first time and then in Tokyo. Then we realized we lived in Paris almost on the same street! It was kind of “love at the first sight” and after playing in the same festivals in Spain and Japan in 2007, we were drawn to each other. Our love story began in that manner. That was exactly 10 years ago.
First date
Our first date was on border of the sea, on the beach of the Costa Brava in Spain. We were watching the sunrise and it was so romantic. I proposed to Shani to get married on the same place three years later. Our first trip was in the desert in Egypt in Siwa Oasis. It was a very special place with a great and contemplative atmosphere. We love travelling and discovering new cultures.
Tying the knot
I proposed her on the beach, exactly on the rock where we first kissed. I surprised her by taking her there and I was waiting for the sunrise again to ask her to marry me. Actually, I came there a bit too early before the sunrise, and we waited for a long time in the dark. Then the sun came up, and of course she said, “YES!!” We were so excited!
Then we got married in my home town, Brittany. There was a very nice castle on the coast of Brittany. We also had a very big wedding in Paris. We had friends coming from all over the world for this occasion: India, Japan, Germany, England, etc. It was very special as the cuisine with a Michelin three star chef. The menu as inspired by the French cuisine and spices from Sri Lanka. We did this to make a connection between our cultures. This day was like a dream… Shani was wearing saree and I was wearing a suit. We also had a wedding in Sri Lanka. I wore a salwar kameez for that! I loved it!
Greatest strength and greatest weakness
Her greatest strength would be that she is hard working, curious, always positive and very creative. Her weakness would be feeling lonely sometimes because she has to travel a lot and not sharing enough time with the one she loves. She is always caring and helpful. She is very passionate in everything she does but at the same time she doesn’t know how to stop! However, I am also like that.
Favourite musical piece from all of her compositions (SUB HEAD)
Shani plays great composers and did so many recordings. I would say my favorite CD is the Schubert which she plays with so much deepness, because it’s very dreamy and profound. She has a unique touch in the tune when she plays it. She has a very special sound on the piano. Everybody says that.
Most memorable performance
The first time I listened to her was in Tokyo at the great Festival “Folle journée”. I remember I cried even though I did not know her well. That was my first impression as an artiste. Then I listened to her performance once we became a couple at the La Roque d’Antheron Festival. That is the greatest piano festival in the world with more than 2000 seats in the theatre. That was impressive as she had a full house. The event was a huge success. That was the day I met her wonderful father. So these are the concerts I will never forget. Of course, there many others and I was unable to attend many since we travel both so much. But of course, we play together sometimes and playing together is always so special. We love it! We perform each year in Sri Lanka. That is also very special for both if us. Every time is unforgettable.
Other passions
Shani writes poetry and she will be releasing her first book next spring. We are all very excited about it. She loves reading and going to the cinema. Both of us share the love of good food and good wine. I am passionate about sports. I do a lot of yoga and swimming. I love watching any kind of sports especially football.
Bonding over tunes
Music is, of course, a very strong bonding between us. More than that, it is our way of looking at the world which united us. We love to share moments with our family and friends. We love inviting people and we try to be generous as possible, giving our time and donating every day as much as we can to help needy people.
We are very strong as a couple because of the values we share and we are also very open to the world. We love to discuss about politics or social topics. We try to be responsible as citizens as well as musicians. We love meeting people, going to the theater or concerts, museum, exhibitions. We adore art and culture. All these values and passions make our bond stronger every day even if we do not meet each other so often. Generally we are 10 days together in a month since we travel all the time because of our concert tours.
Favourite holiday destination
I would say that our favourite holiday destination is Sri Lanka! We love Sri Lanka and I in particular love it so much! I am very close to Shani’s family and to the culture. We also love to go to Japan where we are invited almost every year to perform. That’s why we chose Japan for our honeymoon! It is a fascinating country, very Asian, sophisticated and Buddhist in spirit.
Animal lovers
We love animals so much! In fact, we had three dogs for a while: Chico, Tyla and Lilou who are Shani’s family dogs. Unfortunately with our way of life, travelling so much, being never at home, it is almost impossible to have pets. We love those three like babies! That is also something we love in Sri Lankans: respecting nature and animals. That is so important.
Foodies
We love every kind of food, but our favourites are Japanese, Sri Lankan, Indian and Italian.
Shani loves cooking and she gives her attention to almost every meal. Sometimes I help her. I love cooking for her when I can. We are a good team in situations when we have many guests at home. She changes recipes all the time, but my favourite dish would be her curry or her “Istanbul Spices Chicken.”
Most touching gesture
She surprised me when she turned up with croissants and pastries at the laboratory where I had to take blood tests. She was also the best “nurse” ever when I had the Dengue fever last year in Sri Lanka. She and her family are really great to me. I feel very close to them and they are very affectionate and caring. Shani always has the best ideas in getting presents for me. She is a wonderful listener and adviser for my life.
Birthdays
Shani doesn’t like to celebrate her birthdays, but I try to take her out to a very good restaurant or spend nice weekends in the countryside. I make her a gift about culture: learning Germany or taking ballet dancing classes. She loves these kinds of gifts.
Alternative profession
If she could not become a professional pianist Shani would have been a poet. However she is talented in that arena too since she is releasing her first poetry book in 2018! She is talented in many things: giving lectures about culture, cooking, decorating or even creating websites!
