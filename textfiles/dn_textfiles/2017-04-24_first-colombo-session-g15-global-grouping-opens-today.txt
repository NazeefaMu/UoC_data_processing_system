First Colombo session by G15 global grouping opens today

The first direct partnering effort by G15 global grouping with Sri Lanka will commence in Colombo today.
Experts from the G15 grouping -the focused country group that works along with G77, which is the largest coalition of developing countries in UN -will conduct their intense sessions in Colombo on April 24 and 25 focusing on Intellectual Property (IP) rights of traditional knowledge.
Today’s Colombo session is a follow up to G15’s 2016 Algeria session on Protection of Intellectual Property (IP) rights of traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions.
Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen will unveil the session joined by Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka to the UN in Geneva Ambassador Ravinatha Aryasinha and World Intellectual Property Organisation’s (WIPO) Assistant Director General Minelik Alemu Getahun.
Also on the cards at Colombo session is the review of the historic Ten-Point Plan, unveiled by Minister Bathiudeen and World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) Director General Dr. Francis Gurry in November 2013 in Colombo.
The pioneering 10 point plan, during Dr. Gurry’s visit to Sri Lanka in 2013, included proposals around the Madrid Agreement helping Sri Lanka’s innovations base-securing international trademark rights creating the framework for a knowledge based economy.
Sri Lanka is the current Chair of G15.
