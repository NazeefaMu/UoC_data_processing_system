MHD launches first high rise apartment project ‘The Heights at Edmonton’

Millennium Housing Developers (MHD) diversified into high rise projects last year, launching its first high rise apartment project “The Heights at Edmonton” at Edmonton Road, Kirulapone, followed by The Heights at Nawala Road, Colombo 05.
Its latest at Rajagiriya Road, Rajagiriya reflect the same concept of providing high standards of luxury and style to corporate sector executives and entrepreneurs as residences or as investments.
Attractively priced to offer affordable luxury, Green Heights at Rajagiriya is particularly noteworthy for its design, which matches the needs of corporate sector managers and entrepreneurs for a higher standard of style and elegance, practical convenience, recreational and sports facilities and low maintenance costs.
Millennium Housing Developers has shown steady growth through this initiative. Chairman's Review of 2013/14 predicted such a scenario. “Despite this industrial set back experienced in 2013, the potential demand for affordable middle income housing continue to surge due to rapid urbanization, high price on renting or lease housing and decline in housing loan interest rates. Looking ahead, the government is focused on achieving a per capita of US$4,000 by 2016; highly encouraging for housing sector…” it said
“We learned a lot about the needs of our target consumer before we launched our first city high rise project The Heights at Edmonton Road Colombo 05. We gained more knowledge with The Heights @ Nawala Road.
We can now say this project is more keenly attuned to our customer’s genuine needs than ever before” said Mr. Harshith Dharmadasa Chairman of MHD.
“A luxury apartment in the outskirts can give you better value in terms of living style and standards, simply because the developer’s outlay for land is lower here than in Colombo; customers get the convenience of Colombo, with a much shorter commute plus higher standard of luxury at a lower price,” he said.
