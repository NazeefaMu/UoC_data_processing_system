Bollywood's 'Deadly Dutt' released from jail

 
INDIA: Bollywood actor Sanjay Dutt was released from prison early on Thursday after serving about four years of a five-year sentence for possessing weapons supplied by gangsters behind deadly bomb blasts in Mumbai in 1993.
The disgraced star kissed the ground and saluted at the prison as he walked free in the western city of Pune, after authorities decided to release him ahead of schedule for good behaviour.
Facing a crush of police and media outside Yerwada Central Jail, the smiling 56-year-old was bundled into a white SUV and driven away.
"I am out here because of their (fans') support. There is no easy walk to freedom, my friends," the 56-year-old later told media at Pune airport before reportedly taking a chartered flight to Mumbai.
Dutt was originally sentenced to a six-year term after being convicted in 2006 of possessing guns supplied by mafia bosses who orchestrated the series of bombings in Mumbai that killed 257 people. He spent 18 months in prison before being released on bail in 2007, pending an appeal.
In March 2013, the Supreme Court upheld his conviction but cut his prison term from six years to five, and the star was sent back to prison to serve the remaining three-and-a half years of his sentence.
Social activists fiercely opposed Dutt's release eight months ahead of schedule, claiming he was being given special treatment because of his celebrity status.
Dutt was granted several months of freedom at different times during his jail spell to work on unfinished Bollywood movies whose multi-million dollar productions were at risk.
Activists filed legal action in the Bombay High Court challenging his release, arguing that other prisoners waited years for a decision on their remission requests.
