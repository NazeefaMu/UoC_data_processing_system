Ratnapura gets Rs. 10 bn for flood control, roads

The government has allocated Rs 10 billion to construct new roads and preventing floods in the Ratnapura district, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
The Minister was speaking at a meeting in Ratnapura recently regarding the development of the Ratnapura district.
The Minister said that the project has already received foreign aid of US$ 60 million. The balance will be financed by the government, he said.
As a permanent solution to the occurrence of floods frequently experienced in the Ratnapura and Kalutara districts, a dam will be constructed across the Kalu Ganga in Malwala, close to Ratnapura town. The Kalu Ganga will also be diverted up to Hambantota via Embilipitiya through a tunnel, the Minister said.
He added that the government has paid attention to constructing a new road network to reduce traffic congestion in Ratnapura town.
