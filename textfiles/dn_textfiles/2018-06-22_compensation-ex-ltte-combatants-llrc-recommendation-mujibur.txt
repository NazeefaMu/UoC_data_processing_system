Compensation to Ex-LTTE combatants, an LLRC recommendation - Mujibur

United National Party (UNP) Colombo District MP Mujibur Rahuman yesterday said that the much debated Cabinet Paper submitted by Resettlement and Rehabilitation Minister D.M. Swaminathan seeking to grant compensation to war affected persons including ex-LTTE combatants consists of some of the recommendations of the Lesson Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) appointed by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
He was responding to a statement by National Freedom Font Leader MP Wimal Weerawansa on this Cabinet and asking people to stop paying taxes to the government, if it continues with its move to pay compensation to ex-LTTE combatants.
Addressing the media at Sirikotha yesterday, MP Rahuman said that Weerawansa is attempting to incite racism by making false statements.
As a person who survives in the field of politics by arousing racist feelings, he (Weerawansa) never raises his voice to strengthen religious harmony, national unity and reconciliation.
MP Rahuman further said that the ex-LTTE combatants are also citizens of this country. So they have a right to lead normal lives without any restriction or monitoring after completing the rehabilitation process.
