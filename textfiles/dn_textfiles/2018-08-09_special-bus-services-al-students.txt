Special bus services  for A/L students

With some railway employees resorting to strike action, the Government yesterday said special bus services will be arranged for students sitting the G.C.E Advanced Level.
Deputy Transport Minister Ashok Abeysinghe said all SLTB depots in the country have been informed to arrange special bus services for students and well as state and private sector employees.
Meanwhile, government sources said that if the need arises, the services of the Security Forces will be used to arrange transport facilities for students sitting the examination today.
The Transport Ministry has decided to cancel the leave of all SLTB employees considering the inconvenience faced by the public due to the railway workers strike.
