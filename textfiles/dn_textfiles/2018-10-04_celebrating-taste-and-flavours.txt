Celebrating taste  and flavours

The Colombo Gourmet Weekis created by Epicurean together with Wine World with the objective of celebrating food and wine. The Gourmet week was started in 2016 and was held exclusively at Galle face hotel, where local chefs created dishes to match different wines and other spirits from Sri Lanka and across the globe.
Uga Residence, Elevate and Galle Face Hotel have all agreed to host Colombo Gourmet week and Daily News went on a culinary expedition to Uga and Elevate to sample some of the food that will be served at these venues from October 3 – 7. Each venue is given different beverages from different countries and it is up to the chef to develop and create a menu to match the beverage.
At Uga Residence we were treated to a Bacon Wrapped black Tiger prawns with Tuna Carpaccio, goat cheese crumble with mango and Thai chili salsa which goes wonderfully with South African Wines. Chef Ganesh from Uga Residences says he had to experiment with each of his dishes three to four times over to make sure the food matched the wine they were serving for the South African Wine evening.

Chef Ganesh’s main dish of Angus Fillet and corn fed chicken ballotine Lyonnais potato with duck fat and truffle jus chicken stuffed with wild mushroom and young vegetables and Tarragon emulsion, was simply delicious.

 CULINARY SCHEDULE•October 3 - Uga Residence from 7pm onwards •October 5 - Elevate from 7pm onwards •October 6 – Galle Face Hotel 7pm onwards •October 7 – Galle Face Hotel 11am onwards (Royal Brunch)

Desserts consisted of Brie & Camembert Panna Cotta, spiced poached fruits with Bernard Series Chenin Blanc. After the culinary experience at Uga we visited Access Towers Elevate Restaurant. Here we sampled the cooking of Chef Anil Rodrigo. The Canapes he prepared goes well with Spanish Wines. The dishes that followed with those lip smacking and appetizing jumbo prawns made the afternoon better.
