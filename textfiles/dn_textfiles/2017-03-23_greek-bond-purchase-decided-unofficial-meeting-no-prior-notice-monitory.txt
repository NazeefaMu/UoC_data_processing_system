Greek Bond purchase decided at an unofficial meeting: No prior notice to Monitory Board

The decision on the controversial Greek Bond purchase in 2011 came from an unofficial meeting held between some officials of the Central Bank, the Presidential Commission inquiring into the Treasury Bond issue yesterday observed. Subsequently, the decision to purchase the Greek Bonds was approved by then Governor Ajit Nivard Cabraal, it was also noted.
The 30 million dollar Euro Greek bonds were then purchased with no prior notice to the Monetary Board, the Commission observed as well.
According to the Auditor General, the transaction has resulted in 15.6 million dollars loss, the Commission was informed. The questioned Greek Bond purchase caught the attention of the Commission when the legal representative President’s Counsel Nihal Fernando was leading evidence. He questioned the present Secretary to the Monetary Board H.A.Karunaratne whether he was involved in the Greek bonds transaction in April, 2011. On a request by the Commission to describe the said informal meeting, Karunaratne said it was a “particular gathering that took the decision. The Governor had the power to amend or adjust the decisions that were taken at the meeting.” To much amusement of those present at the Commission , Supreme Court Justice P. Jayawardane told Karunaratne, the ;”last time I heard of a gathering ,it was the elephants in Minneriya. So what is this gathering you are talking about?”
Karunaratne replied it was a “casual meeting” and that he would like to withdraw the word “gathering.” He also said the group included Deputy Governor Weerasinghe, Siriwardane, Ananda Silva and himself were among this so called ‘gathering or group’. Asked if this said meeting or discussion was official, Karunaratne said as a matter of fact it was not.
Justice Jayawardane then questioned Karunaratne whether he is suggesting to the Commission that “a gathering took a decision to purchase Greek Bonds with the approval of Governor Cabraal, and it was only after the purchase of them in April,2011 the Monetary Board was notified .” Justice P. Jayawardane also said even though Greek Bond issue is not within the mandate of the Commission, the questions were asked for everybody’s general interest as citizens.
