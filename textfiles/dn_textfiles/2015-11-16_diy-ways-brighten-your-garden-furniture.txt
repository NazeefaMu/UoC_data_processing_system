DIY ways to brighten up your garden furniture

Love sitting in your garden but feel your chairs are in need of a face-lift? Try this simple, yet effective DIY idea Are your outdoor chairs looking a little shabby? Follow this easy guide to make your garden the envy of all your neighbours...
You will need:
Garden furniture
Newspaper dust sheets
Sandpaper
Masking tape
2 cans of all-surfaces spray paint
Move your furniture to a well-ventilated area and place it on top of a large dust sheet or some old newspapers. You may want to cover the surrounding area with additional dust sheets newspaper to protect it from spray mist.
Make sure the surfaces that will be painted are free from loose paint, rust, wax, oil and grease, and lightly sand down furniture that's been previously painted.
Cover any areas you don't want painted with masking tape - like the metal legs on this rattan chair.
Using your selected colour (we chose bright orange), hold the can approximately 30cm from the surface of the furniture and spray in a steady back-and-forth motion, slightly overlapping with each stroke. For best results, apply several light coats a few minutes apart.
Once completely dry , they're ready to use.
Top tip: If you prefer a subtle look for your garden furniture, opt for cream or mossy green paint.
