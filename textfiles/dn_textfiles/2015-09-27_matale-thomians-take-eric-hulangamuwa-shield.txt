Matale Thomians take Eric Hulangamuwa Shield

St. Thomas College, Matale, won the Eric Hulangamuwa Challenge shield when they beat St. Thomas College, Kount Lavinia by 2 goals to nil in their inaugural hockey big match organised jointly by the Old Thomians Hockey Union, Mount Lavinia and Matale Old Thomians Hockey Association and sponsored by Nations Trust Bank and played at Edward Park, Matale Before a large crowd on Saturday. At half time the Matale Thomians led 1-0.
Though the Matale Thomians known for their prowess in hockey held the home advantage of playing in familiar conditions they were given a fright by their counterparts from the school by the sea. They defended their territory stout heartedly compelling the Matale stickers to pull every trick from their bag to breach their defence. This was something which the Matale Thomians never bargained for.
From the beginning the game was played at a furious pace with play swinging from one end to the other though the Matale boys enjoyed a better share of possession but they could not crack the whip with ease.
It took 20 witness for the Matale Thomians to open their account when left flanker S. Wijetunga dribbled past two defenders and scooped the ball to centre forward Dinusha Madhusanka who scored with a well calculated drive.
The teams changed ends and on resumption the Mount Lavinia stickers displayed that they wee no push overs and showed the “Thomian grit” in style.
Eighteen minutes into the second half the Matale Thomians scored again and this time through centre forward Dinusha Madhusanka who enjoyed a good tame. If there was a “Best Players’ award he would have been one of the top contenders for it.

It was a good game of hockey played in the best spirits and the Mount Lavinia Thomians were never thrown into a whirlpool of despair as they gave back as much as they received and it was simply that their moves did not have the required finish and they did not have many opportunities to the scoring range of the semi circle. Eric Hulangamuwa Challenge Shield was handed over to the Matale Thomian Skipper by the Principal of St. Thomas College, Matale Dampiya Wanasinghe and Chaplian of St. Thomas College Mount Lavinia Rev. Fr. Amal Fernando.
