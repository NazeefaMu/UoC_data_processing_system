(In)visible Dialogues at the Walawwa Gallery

Celebrated artist and sculptor Dr. Manoranjana Herath’s exhibition of paintings and sculptures opened last week at Sri Lanka’s newest art destination, ‘The Walawwa – Gallery’, housed amid salubrious surroundings in a historic old walawwa (mansion) at No 630, Kotte Road in Sri Jaywardenepura Kotte.
Open to the public each day from 9.30am to 6.30pm until June 18, this exhibition features 10 sculptures and 15 drawings based on a profound theme titled ‘(in)visible Dialogues.’
This masterful collection depicts his creative genius and artistic perspective to a world preoccupied with dialogues.
