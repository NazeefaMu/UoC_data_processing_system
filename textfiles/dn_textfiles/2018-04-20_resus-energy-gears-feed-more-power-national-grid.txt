Resus Energy gears to feed more power to national grid

Hydro electricity is the oldest and the principal source of electricity generation in Sri Lanka. Its unique geography renders the country perfectly suited for hydropower generation through large scale and mini hydropower plants. Joining the latest technologies with an environmentally responsible business proposition to generate renewable and sustainable energy, Resus Energy PLC operates several such mini hydropower plants in Sri Lanka.
While increasingly supporting the national effort to develop renewable energy resources in Sri Lanka, Resus Energy PLC last week acquired Sierra Power (Pvt) Ltd and is currently developing its hydropower project in the Nuwara Eliya district. Fed by the Madulla Oya, the project will feed an estimated 2 MW to the national grid.
The Company is also currently developing two more mini hydro power projects, both in their construction stages; the Ranwala Oya Project in the Kegalle district and Hulu Ganga Project in the Kandy District, both of which are estimated to contribute up to 700 KW and 1.9 MW respectively.
“As a company that is truly interested in the people and the planet in pursuit of its primary business goals, Resus Energy PLC, believes in creating a shared value that benefits all its stakeholders. Towards this end, we consistently strive to make sure that our carbon footprint remains at an absolute minimal level even as we scale up on our operations. Resus Energy PLC gives priority to ensure that none of its operations have negative impacts on the environment”, said Managing Director of Resus Energy PLC, Kishan Nanayakkara.
In the recent past Resus Energy PLC completed two more mini hydropower projects in its continuing efforts to further increase its supply to the national grid. In 2016 was the Gomale Oya mini hydropower project in Maliboda, and in 2017 was the Moragaha Oya mini hydropower project in Kandy, both generating an additional 1.4 MW and 1.5 MW respectively to the grid.
“We take great pride in our hydropower generation operations and in our ability to transmit over 30GWh of electricity to the national grid that eventually powers our nation. We take great responsibility in harnessing renewable and sustainable energy and to also ensure that all our projects have little or no impact on the environment. We intend to work very hard towards more efficient extraction of power and use sustainable technology as available to do so in the future,” Nanayakkara added.
Resus Energy PLC took its initial steps in renewables in 2007 with the development of 2.0MW Giddawa mini hydropower project in Teldeniya using water from the Hulu Ganga.
This was followed in 2010, with the acquisition 2.6MW Upper Agra Oya mini hydropower project in Lindula. In 2011 it developed and commissioned the 2.4MW Upper Magal Ganga hydropower project in Maliboda,
While the core growth strategy of Resus Energy PLC is centred around hydropower, the company has also been consistently exploring other renewable energy sources such as solar power, wind power and biomass. Resus Energy PLC has been awarded the rights for two 01 MW each solar power plants feeding into the Ampara grid substation under the CEB’s Soorya Bala Sangramaya Phase 1, that it is currently under pre-development stage.
Over the last few years Resus Energy PLC has been consistently recognised for its successful efforts. The company won in the Bronze category at The National Green Awards (Okanda Power Grid Pvt. Ltd.) for the Upper Magalganga Hydropower Power Project in 2017. It also won Silver at the CA Sri Lanka Annual Report Awards in 2015, 2016 and 2017, and, was a Runner Up in the SME Category at the ACCA Sustainability Reporting Awards in 2017.
Designed and developed using expert local knowledge, the latest technology and a true passion for nature conservation, Resus Energy projects are all planned and executed sustainably and responsibly. All project development budgets also include a considerable portion to develop the surrounding communities of each project.
Resus Energy PLC has provided infrastructural development to public properties, scholarship funds, community programs and employment to the surrounding communities of its projects. As a forerunner in renewable and sustainable energy and, focussed and efficient innovations, Resus Energy PLC is well placed to contribute more towards powering the nation in the future.
