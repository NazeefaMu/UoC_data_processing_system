Drinking water for Aragoda families

The Sri Lanka Malay Association (SLMA) with the Families Relief Sri Lanka Trust, launched 'Water for Life' drinking water project for Aragoda in Anamaduwa on a request of the Incumbent of the Sri Priyarathnarama Viharasthanaya in Monnekulame, Ven. Pankaduwe Gnanakitthi Thera, who said families have to trek for miles to obtain drinking water and are often exploited by private parties who sell bottled water for high prices.
Under the project, a tube well was dug and a water pump, storage and dispensing system was installed in the village to provide drinking water. Ven Pankaduwe Gnanakitthi Thera and SLMA President Taslim Rahaman unveiled the system. Rahaman said the SLMA was pleased to ease the burden of the families in Aragoda and will continue to lend a hand to Sri Lankans in need during the Association's 96th year of social service.
