Matthew Fleming next MCC president

Former England allrounder Matthew Fleming has been announced as the next Marylebone Cricket Club president. He was nominated by the current president Roger Knight at the AGM at Lord's.
"It is important to me to nominate a member who is well versed in, and fully supportive of, the ethos of MCC and who will be recognised, not only within the club, but also in the wider world of cricket," said Knight.
"Matthew was a fine allround cricketer, who captained Kent with distinction and who earned England recognition in one-day internationals. A brilliant cover-point fielder, he was often a daring cricketer - indeed his first two scoring shots in first-class cricket were sixes.
"He understands present-day cricketers, as a former Chairman of the Professional Cricketers' Association, and is respected widely around the game. Matthew will undoubtedly be an excellent President of MCC."
Fleming, who is the current Chairman of Cricket will take charge on October 1, 2016. The 51-year-old played 11 One-Day Internationals for England. He played 219 first-class games for Kent scoring 9206 runs at an average of 30.18 and took 290 wickets at 35.91. He then went on to play an important role in the MCC Foundation's work in Afghanistan.
"I would like to thank Roger Knight for nominating me to succeed him as MCC president, Fleming said.
