Harmony knows no race

The recent incidents of violence, intimidation, hate speeches and threats by few small groups of extremists on the Muslim community and their business and worship places have caused serious concern among the peace-loving people. The Government moved swiftly to mitigate the situation and President Maithripala Sirisena ordered law enforcement agencies to take stern action against those responsible. The Government also decided to create a special unit with full powers to curb religious and racial violence.
These were unfortunate incidents that should not have occurred. It has once again proven how fragile our inter-racial and inter-religious relations can be if there is no mutual understanding and respect among people of diverse races and religions. It has also demonstrated that we must never take our inter-racial and inter-religious harmony for granted. These incidents should serve as a warning sign to all of us on the need to improve peaceful co-existence among all communities in our country.
Of course, first of all, we need to carefully study the causes that provoked the recent discord and resulting violence. It seems obvious that the Police and the local political leadership failed to tackle the issues, then and there, when it cropped up at ground level. The reasons for such a lapse also need to be investigated and corrective action taken.
What we are witnessing today is that the social fabric which keeps the nation together can be affected by occasional incidents that portray intolerance, lack of respect for one another and even acts of extremism beyond acceptable norms.
Community leaders
Patriotic Sri Lankans, regardless of race, religion or political affiliation, must build bridges and not walls which will only divide us. We need more bridge builders to connect each other, not racial and religious bigots. As a nation, we cannot have any racial or religious tension, and attempts by certain quarters to instigate such strife will only further polarise our nation.
Racial and religious issues are the biggest obstacles to social cohesion and national unity and it should be the responsibility of all Sri Lankans to continue promoting harmony among different ethnicities despite the multifaceted challenges.
Perhaps Sri Lanka would be better served if the community leaders find space to engage in their communities in a constructive discussion so as to alter the sensitive climate that surrounds the topics of race and religion.
Role of school
It is in this aspect, that the school plays a very crucial role in maintaining religious and racial harmony. Take, for example, Singapore. They have a Racial Harmony Day which is regarded as an important date in the school calendar. On this day each year, schools celebrate in a variety of ways. Students share dishes traditionally associated with their ethnic cultures, wear traditional costumes, and organise small-scale exhibitions that showcase customs and festivals of different ethnic groups.
Such activities provide the opportunity for cultural interactions and the space for building inter-religious and inter-racial friendships. Additionally, schools also systematically foster better understanding through the curriculum of subjects like Social Studies, and Civics and Moral Education, where they develop students’ awareness on multiculturalism and teach them how to negotiate differences.
Unfortunately, Sri Lankan schools seldom discuss race and religious issues, because they are widely regarded as sensitive topics. Although most of the teachers know discussing such issues that emerge in daily life could potentially improve social cohesion, they would, however, avoid in-depth discussions in the class. They fear that they are ill-equipped to handle difficult situations, and some are even afraid that they would get into trouble with the law.
Guiding students
It is same with the general society also. We hesitate to upset the status quo and as a result, we fail to question, converse and understand others. Should this be the ideal cohesion that we should strive for? Wouldn’t this complacency potentially lead to an eruption of submerged animosity should something unfortunate happen in Sri Lanka?
We need to seek answers to these questions.
This writer believes that the real question at hand is not a matter of whether we should talk about race and religion. Rather, we should ponder about how we can engage in constructive discussion in a respectful and enlightened manner. After 69 years of Independence, it would perhaps serve Sri Lanka better if we are able to change the sensitive climate that surrounds race and religion to allow more space for educators and other professionals to broach related topics.
In guiding students to have deep and honest dialogues on racial and religious matters, educators can help students develop critical thinking as well as empathy and respect for others when handling related issues. With such training from schools, the young would be better equipped to exercise deep thought, responsibility and tact when expressing themselves. This would be better for racial and religious harmony in Sri Lanka in the long-term.
Platforms
The Inter-Racial and Religious Confidence Circles (IRCCs) are another platform introduced by the Singapore Government for local-level inter-religious and inter-racial platforms in every constituency. The work of the IRCCs is instrumental in strengthening social cohesion.
The IRCCs serve as important bridges between religious, ethnic and community groups at the local level. Leaders from various religious, ethnic and other community organisations have come together to join the IRCC networks to build friendships and trust. The IRCCs also aim to deepen people’s understanding of the various faiths, beliefs and practices through interfaith and inter-ethnic themed activities such as inter-faith heritage trails, inter-faith talks and dialogues and various ethnic and religious celebrations. The IRCCs are also primed to respond quickly to incidents with racial and religious tensions and to project solidarity on the ground during crises.
Through the IRCC, Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY) encourages leaders and their followers from religious organisations to join in the efforts to build networks of trust during peace time. MCCY is also actively involving the other ethnic and community organisations to participate in the IRCCs. In the aftermath of a crisis, they will be the key links to disseminate information, soothe and minimise communal tension, and maintain confidence in the community.
IRCC members also keep track of grievances and complaints from the ground, thus giving them a unique understanding of local racial or religious sentiments. IRCCs also function as the main sources of information from the Government on the ground. In addition, the IRCCs also organise important “sessions” like Networking Sessions, Interfaith Dialogues, interfaith/interracial visits, etc.
National IRCC Workshop
At this annual strategic workshop for members, key stakeholders reflect and take stock take on the IRCC milestones and achievements. The National IRCC Workshop is a platform for members, religious and community leaders to share, discuss and feedback on inter-racial and inter-religious issues. The workshop offers excellent opportunities for the members to network and cement valuable friendship bonds. In addition, the participants are appreciated and lauded for their efforts in promoting racial and religious harmony.
In the subject of racial and religious harmony, Singapore is a success story. Three years ago, the Pew Research Center (nonpartisan American “fact tank”) produced estimates of the religious makeup of 232 countries and territories. Singapore has the highest score on the Religious Diversity Index.
Common points
Let us honestly realise that Sri Lanka is facing a serious challenge today. The current religious and racial landscape is not something that can continue automatically through “cruise control”. We must be prepared to carry the torch; we must be conscious of the fault lines in our society. We must be prepared to do our part of managing our divisions and strengthening the cohesion in our society. To do this, we can learn a great deal from the experiences of other countries.
It is important to look back our history and celebrate our achievements but we must also look forward to the future and make sure we can continue to sustain many more centuries of peace and harmony in Sri Lanka. We should focus on the things we share - common reference points and shared experiences that bring us together as a nation that will build into our heritage and identity as Sri Lankans.
