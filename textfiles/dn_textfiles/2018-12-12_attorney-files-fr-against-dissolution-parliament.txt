Attorney files FR against dissolution of Parliament

Filing a motion in the Supreme Court, Attorney-at-law Aruna Laksiri said that President Maithripala Sirisena’s alleged decision urging the Chief Justice to deliver judgment on the dissolution of Parliament without delay, was detrimental to the independence of the judiciary in the country.
“The alleged decision taken by the President is detrimental to the country’s independent judiciary. I urge the Supreme Court to deliver the final judgment regarding Fundamental Rights petitions after perusing relevant facts presented before courts,” Laksiri said.
He was of the view that the President could not make such a request since he did not file an application in terms of Article 129 of the Constitution.
He further said that the media had reported the fact that President Sirisena had made a request through the Attorney-General, urging the Chief Justice to deliver judgment on the dissolution of Parliament without delay.
Aruna Laksiri is one of the petitioners who filed a Fundamental Rights petition challenging the dissolution of Parliament.
He also filed an application in the Supreme Court on Monday, requesting that a charge sheet be filed against Speaker Karu Jayasuriya for contempt of court in terms of Article 105 (3) of the Constitution.
