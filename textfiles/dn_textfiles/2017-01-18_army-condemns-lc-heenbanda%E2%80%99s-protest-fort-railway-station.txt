Army condemns LC Heenbanda’s protest at Fort railway station

Lance Corporal H. A. Heenbanda’s protest at the Fort Railway station on Monday is meant to publicly ridicule the Army and tarnish its image, the army said.
LC Heenbanda who was rendered disabled during the war was posted to the Yakkala Ranaviru Apparels factory for light duties as a subject clerk for accounts, related to the Sahana Welfare Loan project. During an Internal Audit conducted by the Directorate of the Army, discovered a financial discrepancy in the Sahana Welfare Loan project necessitating the appointment of a Court of Inquiry to investigate the matter.
Investigations confirmed both the officer-in-charge of the Sahana Welfare Loan project accounts and Lance Corporal Heenbanda were directly responsible for the financial fraud, committed through the preparation of forged name lists of his fellow-soldiers in the factory. During interrogations and his evidence, the Court of Inquiry recommended recovering Rs 465,525 from Heenbanda, which was re-affirmed in the Commander’s conclusions. Heenbanda had paid Rs 250,000 to the Yakkala Ranaviru Apparels, of the total missing sum. He had received a 50 percent disability category in the Medical Board and had gone on retirement with a monthly salary plus a disability pension of Rs 65,597.56 on August 26, 2013. Steps were taken to deduct the balance dues of Rs 215,252 from his gratuity payments, and he was subsequently intimated verbally and also in writing to report back to his mother unit for preparation of his final clearance process and settlement of outstanding issues.
