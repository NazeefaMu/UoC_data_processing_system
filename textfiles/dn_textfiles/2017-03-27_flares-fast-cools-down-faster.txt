Flares up fast, cools down faster...

On the field, he is known for his grip on the game. However one of the greatest test match bowlers of our times, Muttiah Muralitharan, has stumped us with his grip on matters off the field too. Little did we know that he makes an ace businessman as well. Take it from his wife, Madhimalar Ramamurthy, Murali leaves no stone unturned when it comes to his latest quest, the country’s first aluminum manufacturing plant. The company is now a year old but keeps him on his toes. However cricket and Murali can never be kept far apart. He is very much a family man too.
Murali in a nutshell
I think Murali is a very humble person. He is extremely dedicated as well. He is very passionate about his work. I believe that ‘humble’ and ‘dedicated’ are the two words which describe him the most.
An alternative profession for Murali
If he had not become a famous cricketer I think Murali would have made a great businessman. He has great business skills. We now own a factory in Horana. He runs it. We manufacture aluminum cans. I was surprised to realize that he is very smart in the business. He built it up from scratch, from organizing funds to getting the land details together. He comes from a non commercial background and the way that he has handled matters is fantastic.
Greatest strength and weakness
His passion for his work is his greatest strength. His greatest weakness is his short temper! He gets angry with the drop of a hat but cools down in the same manner.
The family man
Murali is a very good father. That automatically makes him a good husband as well. He is very mature. That sort of translates in the way he handles problems. This makes things easy to handle in a relationship. When I flare up he is calm. It is the same the other way round. When he gets annoyed at something I manage to keep cool.
If we have a disagreement about a matter like how we handle the kids, the first thing we do is not to talk about the matter in front of them. We have our own private discussion before we come to a decision. Then we inform the kids about the decision. However if the disagreement is about other matters like finance or travelling, and there is no other choice, then we just agree and go with it.
These days Murali’s time is taken up by our factory. Once or twice a month we visit a restaurant. My son, Naren, loves to eating out. If Murali has some free time we take the kids out to a play area.
Romance
Romance and Murali are two poles apart. We celebrated out 12th wedding anniversary on March 21. Even then nothing ‘romantic’ was between us. We are eight years apart. He did not bring me a flower or anything - probably because of his maturity.
We met each other for the first time for about 10 to 15 minutes in South India. It was an arranged marriage. I come from a family of doctors and I had no clue as to how a cricketer lives his life. One of the first words Murali told me was that he practically “lives in a suitcase”. I was baffled by the term. But once I got married to him I realized what he meant. He had to be away every month to take part in matches. I think it was Murali’s frankness and his caring nature towards his family and friends which captivated me. He brought everything out onto the table. I guess what made me say “yes” to him was the right time, the right people, the right person and being at the right place!
When I am with the children and I need something to be done, he is always there to help me. I think that is very important when a person becomes a mother. When I need help Murali is always hands on with the children. He has always been supportive of me wherever I go.
Foodwise
Murali loves his rice and curry. He is not into red meat much. He likes certain seafood items like fish. He is not a fan of crabs and prawns. His favourite food out of the dishes I cook is the South Indian chicken curry.
One change...
Nothing! His strengths are more than his weakness so I would not like to make any alterations in Murali.
Murali is particular about...
He is very specific about his workouts. He would always be consistent. He takes care of himself and he would suggest that to our children as well because it is essential for us to take care of our health in the long run.
Murali goes for a five kilometer run in the Parliament Grounds every morning. Now he is done doing strength training. So no more gym for him. When he was with the team they had an extensive workout pattern which demanded cardio exercises and flow workouts. Now he is only doing cardio workouts.
Holidaying
Holiday usually means going to India for the IPL in April. I get to spend 30 days with my parents and family in Chennai. The children get to meet their cousins, explore the city and taste some Indian food. If Murali is coaching abroad I would either join him there for around five days and come back or if the kids accompany me, it will be a longer stay.
Temperwise
I think a lot of little things annoy Murali. He flares up fast but luckily he also has the ability to cool down fast. I don’t get annoyed fast but when I do, it usually takes time for me to regain myself. He does not like to be disturbed when he is on a business call. Naren is quite enthusiastic about cricket and plays in the under 13 team. So he is always asking all sort of questions about the game from Murali and if Murali is on the phone then that really gets to him.
Best present
He once bought me a Cartier watch during one of his tours. I had to stay behind then because Naren was too small to travel. I was quite taken surprise when he gave me that gift.
He has less patience for things like shopping, so I always go on my own shopping sprees. He also finds it difficult to engage in such activities in public places for a long span because of the fans.
Fanatic fans
Sri Lankan fans respect our privacy. They would come and say things like “Aiya, can I take a picture with you after you finish your dinner.” But in other Asian countries like Pakistan and Bangladesh the situation is so not like that. That is because they think cricketers are Gods. I think for them to even think like that is a great honour for a person. Our daughter, Krisha, was puzzled once about why everyone was taking photos of Murali at the airport in Bangladesh. I had to explain the matter to her and she said that she too wants to be a cricketer when she grows up so that everybody will want to take photos of her!
Favourite past times
We love watching movies together. Films starring the Superstar Rajinikanth are our all time favourites.
Three lesser known facts
1) Murali is not very bothered about his appearance. He likes to be laid back. If you call him for an interview, he would come in his track pants. If you call him for a national interview on TV - track pants again - unless the person informs him what to wear and come. Once I told him “Murali, you will be on TV!” Then he said “They would capture my visuals from the bust upwards, right?” Clothing and Murali do not blend together at all. He goes for blue coloured clothes but I have forced him to wear maroons as well because I think that goes well with his skin colour.
2) Murali is very close to his family and helps them out always. He prioritizes a lot on his three brothers. He is close to his 1996 World Cup winning team and ex-cricketers like Mahela and Sanga. He is also into charity big time. I truly believe that Murali is a great man because it is not always that you come across people who are willing to help people, instantly.
3) Murali loves to do things by himself. He always drives his car and does the grocery. Once another customer came up to him at the store and exclaimed “I can’t believe that you are actually carrying all the vegetables!” “So? I eat those vegetables and it is okay for me to carry them because they are for my family,” Murali replied.
