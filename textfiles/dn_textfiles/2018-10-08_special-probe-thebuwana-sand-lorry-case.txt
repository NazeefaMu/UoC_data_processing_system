Special probe into Thebuwana sand lorry case

Police Headquarters Special Investigation Unit will inquire into the Thebuwana incident where a sergeant was arrested for being unruly last week.
The sergeant attached to the Thebuwana Police claimed that he arrested a lorry transporting sand illegally on September 29, but the OIC released it later without action.
Police Media Spokesman SP Gunasekara said the Special Investigation Unit was ordered to investigate the sand transport lorry and its licence by the IGP on the instructions of Public Administration, Management and Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara.
