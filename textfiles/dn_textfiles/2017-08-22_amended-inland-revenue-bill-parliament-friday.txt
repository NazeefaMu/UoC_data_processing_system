Amended Inland  Revenue bill to  Parliament on Friday

The amended Inland Revenue bill will be presented in Parliament on Friday by Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera.
An official from the Finance Ministry said that concerns raised by the Supreme Court have been addressed. The Supreme Court’s directives were mostly administrative issues.
“In addition issues brought up by the business community and trade chambers too have been considered and necessary amendments included,” he said.
