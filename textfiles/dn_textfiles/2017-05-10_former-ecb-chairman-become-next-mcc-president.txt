Former ECB chairman to become next MCC president

Former England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Lord MacLaurin is to become the next president of the MCC.
He will take over the role at the Marylebone Cricket Club from current president Matthew Fleming and his year in office will begin on October 1.
Lord MacLaurin said: ‘It is one of the greatest honours in cricket to be invited to be the president of the finest cricket club in the world and I am thankful to Matthew Fleming for asking me to succeed him. “I have been a member of MCC for over 50 years, and I take great pride in seeing how the club has blossomed over that period - not only with the development of this iconic ground but also with all of the work done to promote the game for men and women, boys and girls, around the world,” said MacLaurin.
“‘I very much look forward to my year in office and hope to help the excellent team at MCC continue all this good work.”
Lord MacLaurin chaired the ECB from 1997 to 2002, and in his business career has been chairman of Tesco and Vodafone.
The MCC said in a statement that Lord MacLaurin’s appointment had been announced at its annual general meeting on Wednesday.
As well as being the owner of the Lord’s cricket ground, the MCC is also known as guardian of the laws and spirit of the sport. It was founded in 1787 and has been based at Lord’s since 1814. – Daily Mail
