The proper way of applying make up is you should first cleanse your face, tone and use a moisturizer. The primer, concealer, foundation, face powder, blush, eye shadow, eyeliner, mascara, lip liner and lip stick should follow next.
Eyeliner, eye shadow or mascara first?
There is a certain level of creativity you can apply to make up, meaning there are no hard and fast rules that designate when to use your products. Still, there are guidelines you may find helpful to follow. When it comes to eye shadows and eyeliners, it’s best to start with eye shadow, then move on to your eyeliner and the last would be your mascara.
Lining the inner rims of your eyes
Wearing eyeliner on the inner rims of the eye may be a bad idea for people who wear contact lenses or for those who have sensitive eyes. You can be prone to eye infection if your eyeliner harbours bacteria.
Using it in the inner rims of your eyes could be just as bad as shoving it into your eyes. However, wearing eyeliner inside or outside the lash line is a personal choice.
Eyelash extensions
Lash extensions are tiny individual lashes that are dipped in a special glue that bonds them to your natural eyelash. It makes your natural lashes look fuller and longer. You can get the look customized to your liking.
Natural eyebrow liner
Pencils and powders work wonders to bridge the gaps and set off a natural look for your eyebrow liner. , Place a brush along the sides of your nose to find where your brows should ideally start. Angle the brush from the outside of your nose to the outer corner of your eye to find where your brows should end. This should be your guideline for your eyebrows. Brush the brows upwards with an eyebrow brush. This helps you to see the shape of the brows and to see the uneven areas. When using the brow pencil apply short, feathery, hair-like stokes angled in the same direction as the hair growth. Refrain from drawing a solid, hard-looking line. Short, feather strokes gives a natural look to the eyebrows.
Smudged liquid eyeliner
It is all about the based when it comes to making your eyeliner last. Apply an eye shadow primer to your lids to give your eyeliner lasting power.
Face premier as eye primer
Face primer will not work better than eye primer which is designed to use on the eyes. This is because the skin on your face is significantly different from the skin on your eyes. As a result of this what each product is designed to do is different.
More than one eye shadow brush
You need to have more than one eye shadow brush because you get different brushes for different areas of the eyes. You get the crease blending brush to smudge the eye shadow and to blend it. You get dense rounded blending brush for quick applications and blended cream shadow looks. The fluffy rounded blending brush is used with a transition shade for a sheer wash of colours on the crease and to avoid harsh lines. The small, tapered blending brush is for a cut-crease look. The duo fiber blending brush needs to be used with light pressure around the brow bone to help crease colors and seamlessly fade them. Use slightly more pressure in the crease to blend multiple colours.
Eye shadow colour to match one’s eyes or clothes
There are no hardcore rules for applying eye shadow colours. If your dress is a real statement, piece maybe you don’t need much make up at all. As for colour, you probably wouldn’t want to match it to your dress - unless you are wearing black, grey or neutrals.
In that case it would be fine to match your eye shadow with the outfit since those colours are basics anyway.
Eye make up for spectacle users
You need to draw your eye liner thicker as this ensures your specs don’t overpower your eyes. Dramatic smokey eyes look good on those who wear glasses.
Removing waterproof mascara
Use an eye makeup remover to remove mascara. A good waterproof eye make up remover will remove all vestiges of the waterproof mascara quickly, safely and effectively. If you wear waterproof mascara a lot investing on a good waterproof eye make up remover is definitely worth it.
Do’s and don'ts while applying eyeliner, mascara and eye shadow
 
4 When applying liner, try not to pull the skin on the side of your face. If things get a little messy, clean up your line with a makeup remover–soaked cotton swab.
 
4 If you are just starting out with liquid liner, begin with dots. Then slowly connect them.
 
4 Wedge the brush at the base of the lashes and sweep the wand outwards with a slight wiggling motion.
 
4 For the lower lashes, just use the tip of the wand and stroke down from the base to the tips of the lashes.
 
4 For the thickest, darkest lashes apply a coat of mascara and wait for it to dry, using a lash comb to separate the lashes while you are waiting, then reapply a final coat.
 
4 Don’t share mascara, as you risk contaminating the product.
 
4 Never ‘pump’ the wand in and out of your mascara tube. This pushes air into the tube and dries out the product, causing clumps to form. Instead twist your mascara wand.
 
4 Clean your lashes well before using mascara .
 
4 Use more than one eye shadow colour. Using more than one colour on your lid will create depth and dimension to your look. It also allows you to be more creative with your application. If done correctly it can make your eyes appear bigger.
 
4 Change your makeup application to stay fresh and to have fun! If you wear a black smoky eye one day, why not try a bronze smoky eye the next day?
All of the makeup out there makes it really fun to be a lady. While there aren’t too many “rules” that you must stick to, the above do’s and don’ts are really great guidelines to keep in mind. Creating a beautiful canvas on your face with makeup can boost your confidence and make you feel on top of the world! And really, isn’t that what we all would love to feel?
