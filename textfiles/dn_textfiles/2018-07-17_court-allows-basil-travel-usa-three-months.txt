Court allows Basil to travel to USA for three months

The Colombo High Court yesterday, permitted former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa to travel to USA for a three-month period.
Basil Rajapaksa, a member of the Sri Lanka Podujana Party (SLPP), whose passport was impounded by court in connection with the alleged fraud at the Divineguma Department, had sought the Colombo High Court’s permission to temporarily lift his travel ban.
High Court Judge Vikum Kaluarachchi ordered the release of the former minister’s passport on a personal bond of Rs. 200,000.
Deputy Solicitor General Asath Navavi, appearing on behalf of the Attorney General, did not raise objections to the request since the defence agreed to represent a lawyer in court if the case was taken up during the period the accused is absent.
President’s Counsel Ali Sabry, appearing for the former minister, moved court that his client be allowed to travel to USA for medical treatment. He submitted in court the relevant documents and flight travel information including departure/arrival time.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against four accused, including former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa, for allegedly misappropriating Rs. 2,991 million of funds belonging to theDivineguma Department while distributing roofing sheets and other housing materials among Divineguma beneficiaries during the previous Presidential election. Meanwhile, Colombo High Court Judge A. A. R. Heiyanthuduwa also permitted the former minister to travel to USA in relation to a case over an allegation of misappropriating of Rs.36.5 million of funds which belonged to the Divineguma Development Department to purchase and distribute GI pipes during the last Presidential election. He is currently out on bail.
