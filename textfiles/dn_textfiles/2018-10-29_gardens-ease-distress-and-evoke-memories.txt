Gardens ease distress and evoke memories

In the world of garden design, it seems we can’t get enough of the dramatic, the breathtaking and that all-important wow factor. But when it comes to gardens that are good for mental health, there’s a different kind of showstopper that can do us all a power of good.
Visitors to this year’s Bord Bia Bloom festival will have a chance to experience this for themselves with one of the show’s highlights, a garden called ‘Moments in Time’ designed especially for people with dementia.
Sponsored by the HSE’s Understand Together team, the project is a collaboration between landscape gardener Clive Jones of Newtown Saunders, TrinityHaus research centre at TCD, and Sonas apc, a charity that provides training and support for people with dementia and their carers.
It’s the second successive year the team has brought a dementia-friendly garden to Bloom, following the silver medal-winning success of their previous entry, set in an urban garden. This year they’re going for gold by turning their attention to public spaces.
“We want to showcase how communities can create a garden designed to stimulate the senses for people with dementia, and provide a place where those with the disease and their carers can come together and socialise,” says Clive Jones.
“With a dementia-friendly garden, you don’t want to overdo the bling. It has to be very calming and stimulate the senses in a deep, meaningful way, enabling people with dementia to access long-forgotten memories and reduce anxiety.”
The Moments in Time garden is an oasis filled with different colours, aromas, sounds and textures, featuring a circular, weaving walkway with coloured concrete and brightly coloured handrails to encourage ease of access.
“The walkway has a number of zones, each with raised beds filled with distinct planting to tap into the five senses and evoke memories,” says Clive. “We’ve used more than 30 types of plants, flowers and shrubs, including lavender, wild grasses, hydrangeas, bright daisies, forest ferns and lemon thyme, which has a wonderful scent.”
The idea of creating a dementia-friendly garden came to Clive almost by accident, during a casual conversation with Professor Mark Dyer, director of TrinityHaus.
“He told me his team was researching how buildings could be designed for people with dementia, and I asked, ‘What about the gardens?’” he says. Further research between the partners led to Sonas apc coming on board. The team now designs gardens for nursing and care homes nationwide.
“It’s not a one-design-fits-all process,” says Clive. “We did a garden for a nursing home in Kinsale with a nautical theme. Each project has to reflect its own local history and heritage so that people can connect with it.” independent
