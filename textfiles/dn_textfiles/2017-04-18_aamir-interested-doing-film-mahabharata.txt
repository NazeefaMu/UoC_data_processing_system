The ace director told Bollywood Life that the plan is very much on and that he has already spoken to Aamir about the movie. “I want to do Mahabharata and I have said that many times but definitely not immediately after Baahubali. Mahabharat is such an epic that I need to up my craftsmanship to handle such a subject. Yeah I met Aamir ji once quite sometime back, we spoke about Mahabharata. I know that he’s very much interested in doing the film. But as I said, at present I am not thinking anything beyond Baahubali. Mahabharata is definitely not after this.”
