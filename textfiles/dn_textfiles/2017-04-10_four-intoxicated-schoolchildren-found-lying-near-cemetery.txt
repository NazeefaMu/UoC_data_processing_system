Four intoxicated schoolchildren found lying near cemetery

Four schoolchildren were found lying in an intoxicated condition near the Kataragama cemetery by residents recently.
The Kataragama police on a tip off had admitted them to the Kataragama District Hospital. The children had told the police that three of them were studying in a leading school in Tissamaharama, while other was studying in a school in Mahsenpura. All of them are grade 10 students.
They had bought liquor from Tissamaharama and consumed them at a friend’s house at Kataragama to celebrate their term vacation.
On their way back, they had fallen asleep near the cemetery, police said.
