Kandurata Umbrella fosters SSC cricket for 6th year

Kandurata Umbrella Industries (Pvt) Ltd once again is proud to offer their sponsorship to the prestigious 118 years old Sinhalese Sports Club as the clothing sponsor, for SSC cricket long concerned as the cradle of National cricket.
The good partnership between SSC and Kandurata Umbrellas has enabled SSC to support their cricket academy to reach greater height in this very competitive field of sport. We at Kandurata Umbrellas are very much honored and proud to be associated and interact actively with this prestigious club which has always looked for top quality and high standard of cricketing excellence. Kandurata Umbrella’s logo was embedded in the players' clothing assuring the company’s great commitment and the encouragement towards this gentlemen' game, stated DGM of Kandurata Umbrella Ind.(Pvt) Ltd, Riza Thahir.
Kandurata Umbrella Ind. (Pvt) Ltd manufacturing and marketing of 'Penguin Brand' products consists of a range of high quality Umbrellas, Mosquito Nets, Socks, and Raincoats.
Chairman SSC Cricket, Samantha Dodanwela went on to mention that; "Unlike good old days, cricket is no longer a game which is played for the prestige or for the love of it.”
“It has now become a profession. Hence like all other sports in the world, cricket too need financial assistance. Kandurata umbrellas coming forward to support SSC cricket for the sixth consecutive year will no doubt help SSC to recruit new talent and also to assist the budding cricketers financially to improve their skills, and I believe this relationship will go on for many more years for mutual benefit.”
