Power sharing, only way forward: Dayasiri

A final solution to the national question can only be brought through power sharing. If it fails this time, all extremist groups which fought against it should take responsibility, said co-Cabinet Spokesperson Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara.
Addressing the weekly Cabinet media briefing at the Government Information Department, the Minister made it clear that if the opponents against a new Constitution had a better method to solve the ethnic problem, they should then propose it and start working on it.
“The Tamil people have a problem in the manner in which power is shared at present. This is the only opportunity we have to sit and discuss it with the Tamil people,” said Minister Jayasekara answering questions as to how the government would proceed with the Constitution given the current opposition to it from the clergy and certain political groups.
He added that they would only agree to power devolution within a unitary state.President Maithripala Sirisena and his rainbow coalition contested the January 8 election in 2015 under the platform of introducing changes to the existing Constitution and with the promise of abolishing the Executive Presidency, said the minister.
Thereafter, a Constituent Assembly was established to set about drafting a new Constitution. The Public Representations Committee on Constitutional Reform headed by Lal Wijenayake travelled to the 25 districts asking people what they want in a new Constitution. The minister questioned as to why the present opponents did not make their views known to Wijenayake’s committee then.
Dayasiri pointed out that the recent report on the draft Constitution was only a collection of viewpoints forwarded by all political parties and that it was not the final draft of the Constitution.
“We don’t even have a draft yet and certain people are against it. We need to sit down and write it and then we can resolve many of the issues,” he said.
“We have a problem with reconciliation. With regard to devolution, we have issues with our Provincial Councils even in the South. For example, if the Provincial Council wants to put a new bus to a village, the permit is needed from the National Transport Commission which has no idea about regional issues. So we have many problems. Chief Ministers around the country have pointed out problems.
Problems exist not only in the North but also in the South when Governors interfere,” added the minister.Dayasiri explained that failure to resolve the issue now would provide incentive to Tamil extremists to push their cause further and silence moderate Tamil politicians once again.
Commenting on the stance of the clergy, the minister said the President had previously discussed the matter with the Mahanayakas and that they would have to speak to the clergy once again to clarify doubts.
