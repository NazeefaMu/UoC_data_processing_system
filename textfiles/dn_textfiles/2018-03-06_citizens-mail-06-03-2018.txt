A reception centre not so welcome
There was a spate of building collapses in Colombo in the recent past, at the height of the rainy season, most widely publicized. One such is a multi-storey reception centre at Charlemont Road, Wellawatta.
At that time, there was a big public outcry against the Colombo Municipal Council, which approves of building plans. How can one put up a building on a road reservation or a canal bank? What can CMC do, when approval is given for five-stories, and if a developer puts up two more stories?
This argument and excuses put forward by the CMC are totally wrong, lame and illegal. CMC has Municipal engineers and inspectors, who are supposed to go to the field and report such irregularities. CMC can certainly stop such illegal constructions. It is their job and they are paid for that. Of course, in a poor third world country like Sri Lanka, anything can be done with money!
Now all have forgotten about Charlemont Road building. Business is as usual, until the next rainy season, and the next building collapses’ Alas!
Dear Municipal Commissioner, do not try to sweep your garbage under the Carpet.
It is stinking. Get your staff to do their jobs. Tell them not to accept bribes. Remove all unauthorized buildings from Colombo.
