Citizens' Mail

Why not make CMC rates also payable through ATMs?
The utility payments such as water bills (from NWSDB), electricity bills (from both CEB and LECO), and telephone bills (from SLT and other mobile operators) could be very easily settled at any time convenient to the consumer through CDM/ATM/kiosks installed at leading banks. This facility, both card and cardless transactions, is very time saving as you don’t have to take a token and await your turn/ wait in a queue to settle these bills.
This is to suggest that the Colombo Municipal Council should collaborate with banks so that the Property tax (rates) also could be paid through the above machines which is operative 24/7 and also user friendly. Otherwise, the rate payers have to visit the Municipality to settle these assessment rates which will be very time consuming with the heavy traffic nowadays.
