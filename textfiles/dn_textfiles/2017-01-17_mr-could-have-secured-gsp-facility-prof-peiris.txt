MR could have secured GSP+ facility: Prof. Peiris

Former Minister Prof. G.L. Peiris yesterday said that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa could have secured the GSP+ facility, if he had agreed to the conditions laid down by the European Union at the risk of country’s sovereignty.
He said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is talking about the regaining of this facility to Sri Lanka, but no a single word uttered about the conditions laid down by the EU to grant this facility to Sri Lanka.
The former Minister said the government has to comply with 58 conditions laid down by the EU to restore this facility to Sri Lanka. These conditions include the repealing of the Prevention of Terrorism Act too, he said.
He said former President Rajapaksa rejected to accept these conditions which would put the country at risk. “We can not pawn the country for the sake of economic growth,” Prof. Peiris said.
