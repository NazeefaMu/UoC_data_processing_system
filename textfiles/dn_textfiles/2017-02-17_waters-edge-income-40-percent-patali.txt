The revenue of state owned Waters Edge Hotel has increased by 40 percent. The hotel was capable of creating a competition among many private sector hotels, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said. Speaking at a foundation stone laying ceremony to establish an entertainment hub at Waters Edge Hotel premises yesterday, Ranawaka said a programme will be implemented to develop the area as an ‘Entertainment Town’ in collaboration with the Sports Ministry and the Urban Development Authority (UDA).
The minister said a target of implementing and opening 100 projects will be achieved from January 8 to April 8 with the participation of UDA, Land Reclamation and Development Corporation and other organisations.
He said the development project will convert acres of land into an area that provides the public with an opportunity to relax.
Waters Edge Hotel Chairman Chamath de Silva said the hotel will provide a platform for all sports in the country along with a train revamped into a restaurant serving hawker style street food.
Land Reclamation and Development Corporation Working Director Roshan Gunawardena, Waters Edge Hotel General Manager Rohan Fernandopulle and Megapolis and Western Development Ministry Secretary Nihal Rupasinghe also participated.
