NPC stirs up again over appointment of two ministers

A group of Northern Provincial Councillors who had submitted a No Confidence Motion against Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran, are preparing to hold a secret meeting to discuss the appointment of two provincial ministers.
These two provincial ministers were appointed by the Chief Minister on Thursday.
Sources from the Northern Provincial Council said the appointment of the two new ministers had become a problem since two names had been proposed for the post of Education Minister by two different groups of council members .
Reports said, members of the Illangai Thamil Arusakachchi (ITAK) group which submitted the no confidence motion against the Chief Minister, had proposed the name of Emmanuel Arnold for the post of Education Minister, while the group of 15 members who opposed the no confidence motion had proposed the name of Kandiah Sarveshan for the post.
Meanwhile, this group had got the name of Sarveshan certified for the Education Minister post during their discussion with the Chief Minister.
But, since the ITAK members have opposed this name, analysts predict that these provincial ministers could face opposition in the future.
