SriLankan to fly to Myanmar on codeshare

SriLankan Airlines will expand its network to Yangon, capital of Myanmar, from June 1, 2017, with the commencement of a codeshare partnership with Myanmar Airways International (MAI), one of Myanmar’s best-known airlines.
SriLankan will codeshare on flights operated by MAI between Bangkok and Yangon and also Singapore and Yangon, while MAI will codeshare on flights operated by SriLankan between Colombo and Bangkok, and Colombo and Singapore. Passengers will enjoy the conveniences of the partnership such as a single ticket itinerary and interlined luggage.
SriLankan Airlines’ Chief Commercial Officer Siva Ramachandran said: “We are pleased to extend our network to Yangon, as part of our dynamic ongoing strategy of focusing on the Asia-Middle East region, which is the fastest growing market for global air travel.
Myanmar is currently experiencing considerable growth in tourism, and we are confident that the addition of Yangon will strengthen our network and help serve the needs of our customers.”
SriLankan has in recent months expanded its codeshare agreements with several other airlines in order to strengthen its network and provide enhanced travel options for its customers.
With the addition of Yangon, SriLankan’s global network will span 101 destinations in 48 countries. SriLankan is also part of the prestigious oneworld global airline alliance network which serves over 1,000 cities in 160 countries.
