SLID conducts first customised training programme

The Sri Lanka Institute of Directors (SLID) actively promotes best practice and professionalism within and beyond the boardroom. On August 26, SLID successfully held its first in-house customized training for Council Members, Executive Council and staff of the Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM).
The programme was designed and delivered by expert business practitioners from the SLID Faculty to SLIM requirements.
The opening remarks were made by Aroshi Nanayakkara, Council Member and SLID faculty member followed by the delivery of the training by SLID Vice Chairman and faculty member Faizal Salieh and Anthony Jayaranjan, SLID faculty member. They integrated their sessions seamlessly interspersing local and international examples making it interesting and lively.
The Session was for three hours and was highly interactive using a real-life case study on corporate governance (CG) covering the key principles, elements and trends in good CG systems, the business case for CG and the key concerns and challenges.
The success of the programme was also due to the high level of interaction all participants brought into the session drawing from their personal experiences and critical analysis of the case study.
SLIM Vice President - Education Pradeep Edwards said their objective was achieved and the programme was good.
“We now offer bespoke training where we work in tandem with you to develop tailored programmes” said Nanayakkara.
