CBK does not want divided or crooks-run SLFP

Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunge yesterday said she does not want to see her party, Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), divided just as much she does not want to see well-known crooks leading it.
In reply to a question posed by the Daily News whether she wanted to see a division in the SLFP, Kumaratunge said, “ No,”
”But I also don’t want to see well-known crooks and murderers leading the party,”she said.
“People voted for us because they wanted a clean-up of the political system. They voted for us against corruption, lack of freedoms, lack of decency and against the corruption of the former regime under the former President, his brothers and children,” she said.
She said even if some people had to go out of the party; it will benefit because it will have better people and not well-recognised crooks and murderers.
“Therefore, It will be stronger,” she said.
