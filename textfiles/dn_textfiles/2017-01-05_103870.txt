Operation to drive away wild elephants from Hambantota

An operation was launched to drive away a herd of about 10 wild elephants that had entered a village in Hambanthota, Suriyawewa and Nabadagaswewa, on Tuesday, Forest Ranger of Wild Life in Hambanthota Wijaya Kumara said.
“Driving away the wild elephants was difficult because these elephants frequently enter the village in search of food,” he said.
Kumara said the forest was being used for various development projects and people engage in cultivation near those areas. He said this was the main cause of wild elephants entering the viillage, he added.
According to Kumara, a separate elephant reserve should be established as a solution to overcome this issue.
