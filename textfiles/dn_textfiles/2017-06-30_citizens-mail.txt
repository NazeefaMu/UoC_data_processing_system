Citizens' Mail

Moving towards an ethical media culture
Lionel Wijesiri's story - “Moving towards an ethical media culture” (CDN June 27) is interesting.
The Yahapalana government may have 101 shortcomings, but it is to their credit that they managed to restore (to a large degree) media freedom.
Even the state controlled media now maintain a reasonable balance in their reporting. The state media’s regular political talk shows often present the opposition viewpoint.
We have also seen how opposition party leaders ruthlessly criticise the government. This is a good sign of freedom.
With this new media freedom, it is the paramount duty of all media to adhere to the principle that media rights accompany and are inseparable from media responsibilities with equal significance given to both.
There also needs to be reverence for life, upholding non-violent conflict resolution, promoting national reconciliation, upholding and sustaining plurality in all its dimensions, respecting the rights of readers or audiences and advocating the inviolability of their privacy.
Are our media taking that responsibility? I personally have my doubts. In his story, Lionel Wijesiri offers some suggestions which are well worth looking into.
