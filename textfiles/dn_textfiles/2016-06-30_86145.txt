Sri Lanka set England a challenging total of 308

 
LONDON: Sri Lanka set England a challenging target of 308 runs to chase after rain had reduced the fourth One-Day International to a 42-overs a side contest at the Oval on Wednesday.
Sri Lanka invited to bat first reached an impressive 305-5 following half-centuries from Babushka Gunathilaka (62), Kusal Mendis (77), Dinesh Chandimal (63) and skipper Angelo Mathews who remained not out 67.
England’s total was adjusted to 308 on the Duckworth and Lewis rain rule.
For the first time in the series the England bowlers were put under pressure as Sri Lanka recovered from losing Kusal Perera early in the innings – run out for one through three fine partnerships.
Gunathilaka and Mendis were well set to take Sri Lanka to a massive total when rain interrupted play with the score on 123-1 in 18 overs. Mendis delighted the massive crowd with a superb display of stroke play and was looking good to reach his maiden ODI hundred when the rains came.
The break gave England a chance to regroup and when play resumed Mendis lost his wicket with his score on 77 scored off 64 balls with 13 fours.
Adel Rashid who picked up his wicket also dismissed Gunathilaka for 62 scored off 64 balls with seven fours. The pair added 131 for the second wicket.
Their dismissals brought the captain and vice-captain together in another fruitful stand that produced 87 for the fourth wicket.
Chandimal made 63 off 51 balls with one four and three sixes, but Mathews despite losing Seekkuge Prasanna cheaply for nine continued to attack the England bowling to reach his half century and when the innings closed had hit six fours and one six in his 54-ball innings.
England lead the five-match series 1-0.
