Government ignored better proposals over Hambantota Port Project: Former Speaker

The Government failed to pay attention to even better proposals regarding the operation of the Hambantota Port Project, Parliamentarian and former Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa said.
He was addressing a meeting attended by his party membership at the Budhirajarama Viharaya Sooriyawewa on August 15.
He said Joint Opposition (JO) members main concern was the manner the resources of the country could be safeguarded and used for the benefit of the future generation.
Rajapaksa said handing over these facilities or selling them to companies for long terms thereby harming national interests is not JO objective, he said.
Chamal Rajapaksa said foreign collaboration was required for developing the country. “But that should be obtained without causing harm to national interests. The conditions that the Hambantota Port was leased out was inimical to country’s interests,” he said.
“Although better proposals were given for the project, they seemed to have been ignored by the Government,” he said.
They feared now that a similar fate would befall the Mattala Airport. “The 99-year lease was totally unfair and when people led by the Maha Sangha took to the streets to protest against the Hambantota Port Agreement, they were set upon by thugs brought down from Colombo. Such an unfortunate fate would not have befallen the Hambantota Port if the Government heeded the public opinion,” he said.
The former Speaker said the Government need to take further action against the bond scam without trying to save its face.
Rajapaksa said Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe was a person who took decisions in keeping with the national interest. “As a person born in Hambantota, Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe has a right to express his views on the Hambantota Port,” he said. “The most strange thing was the complete silence of the two ministers representing the Hambantota district over the whole issue,” the former Speaker said.
