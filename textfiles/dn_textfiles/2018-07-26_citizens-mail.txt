Citizens' Mail

Alternative measure to death penalty
The European Union is opposing the re-introduction of the Death Penalty although our serious crime rates like the rate for murder and child abuse are a world record. Although this is an unwarranted interference in our domestic policies we are not in a position to say boo to a goose. We may have to comply.
What alternative measures can we take to reduce the serious crimes rate? We may have to streamline our punishments. Are our prisoners treated with a kid glove? Do we treat them too softly in prison? Should we not work to death those murderers who have been given the death penalty? Should not all benefits and concessions be withdrawn from them since they cannot be hanged? Where is the deterrent effect in our present treatment of convicted prisoners?
Isn't it necessary to review the present concessions given to those who have been given the death penalty since it cannot be carried out now?
