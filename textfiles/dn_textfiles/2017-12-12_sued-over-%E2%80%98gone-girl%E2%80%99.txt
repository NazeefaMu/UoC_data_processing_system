Sued over  ‘Gone Girl’

Actress Reese Witherspoon has been sued by a writer who claims ‘Gone Girl’ is a rip-off of a screenplay penned by her. Witherspoon received various awards for producing the 2014 film ‘Gone Girl’. A screenplay writer named Leslie Weller has claimed she wrote a screenplay called ‘Out of the Blue’ back in 2005 and sent a copy of the same to a script consultant. That allowed someone to lift her work.
Reportedly, she said the book ‘Gone Girl’, which came out in 2012, is a rip off of her screenplay. Mentioning similarities between the book and her screenplay, Weller said they both focus on a married couple’s relationship where the husband and wife are slowly drifting apart.
“They both contain a key twist where the wife is not the nice, normal, and somewhat naive housewife and is in fact a psychopath who sets up her husband,” she said. Besides Witherspoon, Weller is also suing the book’s author Gillian Flynn and the movie’s director David Fincher.
