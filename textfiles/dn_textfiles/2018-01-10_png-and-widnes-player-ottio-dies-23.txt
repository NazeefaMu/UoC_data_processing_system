PNG and Widnes  player Ottio  dies at 23

Sydney: Papua New Guinea rugby league player Kato Ottio, who recently signed with English side Widnes Vikings, has died aged 23 from “a sudden health issue” while training, officials said Tuesday.
Ottio spent two seasons with the Canberra Raiders in Australia but after failing to break into their National Rugby League squad, which saw him sign with Widnes in December. PNG Rugby Football League chairman Sandis Tsaka said died at a hospital in Port Moresby early Tuesday.
“Details of (his) death will be released later,” he added on Facebook. Ottio was expected to travel to England next week to get ready for the start of the new Super League season in February.
“We are devastated to learn that Kato Ottio has passed away. Kato was an incredibly talented player, with a bright future ahead of him in rugby league,” Widnes chief executive James Rule said on the club’s website. AFP
