Three oldest players to score a century in ODIs

One-day cricket has always been known as a youngsters' game. It takes a toll on the player as it demands a lot of physical activity. To score a century in one-day cricket, a player should not only be well-equipped to play a wide range of shots and get boundaries but also have the awareness to rotate strike and get some quick singles and doubles.
While a century is an achievement any cricketer craves for, some cricketers have been more fortunate to get a century when they are relatively older. In this article, we look at the three oldest cricketers ever to score a century in ODIs.
#3 ED JOYCE (39 years 111 days)
Ed Joyce is one of the most popular cricketers to have ever played for Ireland. He is also one of the very few cricketers to have played for two countries ( Ireland and England ). At the beginning of 2018, Ed Joyce slammed a century against UAE in the tri-series (also featuring Scotland) at Dubai.
After being put to bat first by Ireland, UAE could only put up a paltry score of 222-9 in 50 overs. Rameez Shahzad was the top scorer for UAE with 75 off 111. Niall O'Brien was really good behind the stumps and took five catches.
In return, Ireland lost wickets in quick succession and were left reeling at 91-5. Ed Joyce then went on to add 131-run partnership with Gary Wilson for the sixth wicket to take Ireland home. He played a very calculated innings and finished with 116 off 149 balls, with 13 fours and a six.

#2 SANATH JAYASURIYA (39 years 212 days)
Sanath Jayasuriya is one of the most dangerous batsmen of all-time. His exploits at the top gave the Sri Lankan batting line up, much-needed confidence and allowed the other batsman to express themselves.
He scored 13430 runs in 433 matches, at an average of 32.36, with 28 hundreds and 68 fifties. He became the then oldest player to record a century, when he did it against his favorite, India in 2009.
In the first match of the 5-ODI series at home, Jayasuriya played a scintillating knock, scoring 107 off 114 balls. His innings had 10 fours and a six, played at a very good strike-rate of 93.86. No one apart from him could get it going and the hosts only scored 246-7 in 50 overs. India chased it down very easily but Jayasuriya's innings gained a lot of attention.

#1 KHURRAM KHAN (43 years 162 days)
A very surprising name here at No.1 on the list. It is Khurram Khan of UAE who is the oldest player to score a century in ODIs. He achieved this feat when he scored a century against Afghanistan in a 4-match ODI series.
After beating Afghanistan in the first ODI very convincingly, the focus shifted to the second ODI in Dubai. The hosts won the toss and chose to bowl first. Afghanistan posted a chaseable total of 280-8, on the back of Nawroz Mangal's 129 off 123.
In return, the hosts lost two early wickets and were reduced to 32-2. Khurram Khan, who came in at No.4, steered the innings along with Mohammad Shahzad and the duo added 160 runs for the third wicket, before the latter got dismissed.
Khurram Khan then went on to smash a century, scoring 137 off 138 balls, accompanied by 17 fours and a six. This was Khurram's only century in ODIs and he also became the first UAE player to score a century. – sportsk
