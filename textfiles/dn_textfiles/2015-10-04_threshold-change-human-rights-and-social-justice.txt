On threshold to change for Human Rights and Social Justice

The world is fully aware of Sri Lanka’s progress towards democracy and the necessity for reconciliation and understanding to ensure the best results of peace.
President Maithripala Sirisena’s address to the United Nations General Assembly on Thursday, expressed the new vision of the country, for sustainable development and reconciliation.
The focus of his statement is the fundamental requirement to deal with the past honestly, and build a modern Sri Lankan nation, which requires the process of truth seeking, reparation and non-recurrence of the past events that led to the tragedy faced by this nation through nearly three decades. He emphasized Sri Lanka’s need to adopt a new social, economic, and political approach to rise up to the challenges of the 21st century, underlining that reconciliation requires priority in this context.
In understanding the background to the developments that brought about the situation the country is now determined to overcome, I recall what a current Cabinet Minister of the SLFP-UPFA, said at Rupavahini’s “Aththa-Neththa” programme on Monday this week. The discussion was about the UNHRC’s resolution that recommended a “hybrid mechanism” into the conflict and post-conflict situation in Sri Lanka. The Minister who was happy at the developments that have now taken place, emphasized that it was not the advise of any astrologer or the need to extend one’s term of office, that made President Mahinda Rajapaksa to call for the January Presidential election. Instead, he was certain it was the prevailing fear in the government that come March 2015, the UNHRC Sessions in Geneva would certainly have framed charges against Mahinda Rajapaksa, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and many of the armed services personnel, engaged in the battle to defeat the LTTE. He had no word about any charges against the then Army Commander Gen. Sarath Fonseka, possibly because he thought Gen. Fonseka had been already punished by Mahinda Rajapaksa, in his quest for internal political revenge.
UPFA campaign
What is strange is that none of this was the highlight of the UPFA’s election campaign, where mainly spoke of the dangers to the Sinhala majority due to a rise of the LTTE, the danger of the “Tamil Diaspora”, with Tamil separatism and terrorism, and the great development work done by the MR regime. We do know that MR, his key supporters Weerawansa and Gammanpila, and other catchers in the campaign did talk of the electric chair that awaited MR, but if the message that this minister said on TV was told to the public, with as much effect as he did, the result on January 8 may have been different.
However, the minister is now most satisfied that with the new resolution at the UNHRC all those dangers are gone, and Sri Lanka is on the correct path to progress and reconciliation, with all the opportunities for development in the years ahead. One hopes such thinking will trickle to others in the UPFA, too.
Yet, what is left of the “UPFA Opposition” – within quotes because the main part of the UPFA is in government -- has not given up its opposition to the Government’s position of working in cooperation with the United Nations, and the revised Geneva resolution, where “hybrid” is no more, and a fully domestic mechanism has been accepted. This section of the UPFA sees this as part of American and Western imperialism, targeting Sri Lanka, in the strategy for Western hegemony in the world. UPFA MPs Dinesh Gunawardena and Vasudeva Nanayakkara made this clear at a media briefing earlier this week. I refer to these two names only, because they have the seniority, and a strong leftist background, to know better about the current developments; and with due diligence and proper political analysis, be able to move away from hackneyed thinking about imperialism, when the country is moving forward in a era of new democracy. This does not rule out the machinations of capitalist and neo-liberal thinking and forces of the West, but it is certainly not sensible to look at every issue with such tinted glasses.
Journey to the future
What President Sirisena told the UN and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has been conveying to the people of this country, with much commitment, is the need for us to take a new turn in our journey to the future. This needs a clear acknowledgment of the past mistakes by all governments, the worst aspects of it being in the near decade of the Rajapaksa regime.
What the Prime Minister has been emphasizing is the need to work in cooperation with the world as represented by the UN and its institutions, as well as, other organizations such as the Commonwealth, and go ahead with much effort and even difficulty, towards reconciliation and understanding. This is seen as the only way forward for a country lagging behind, despite very costly highways, displaying the extent of fraud and corruption that has prevailed, which needs rooting out through every means possible.
The progress made in Geneva would mean, as the PM Ranil Wickremesinghe has shown, that we are moving into a new era of Commissions, which are necessary to guide the country in the search for the truth as to how our crises began and were allowed to grow until the county and people were smothered by a crisis that caused so much bloodshed from 1971 to 2005. In addition to knowing the truth, these are necessary for the process of reconciliation, which is so vital for proper island wide development of the sustainable type; development that is not directed by a family tree of political power, and racist or majoritarian thinking, but a wider holistic thinking of the entire nation.
It is useful to recall that after the JVP insurrection in 1971, there was a commission appointed to study the needs of youth. It did make many valuable recommendations, but most of them remain unimplemented, which as part of what led to the next uprising of youth in the North, going on to become a terrorist war for separation.
Shoulders to the wheel
What is required by all political forces, those who speak for progress for the country, and not for special families or interest groups, is putting their shoulders to the wheels that will drive us towards a new age of modern and constructive development. The idea of consensual government must be effective, by proceeding with no hesitation against the forces of corruption that have prevailed over the past decades. This will mean, showing more to our own people, than to the world, that we can be a democratic society, with a truly independent judiciary, an independent and properly functional administrative machinery, a proper audit authority, and very importantly a police that truly serves the needs of society, and not the narrow interests or the false image building of its efficiency.
As stated last week, we cannot blame the world or the UNHRC for having doubts about the quality and capacity of our judiciary, when we look at what has happened to it through continued political interference and manipulation over the years. The record is one that is contemptible and we have much to do give our judiciary the shining image it had and deserves.
Those who gathered information to prepare the UNHRC’s latest report on Sri Lanka would not have been unaware of the problems we have in the police, seen to this day, and the problems regarding the office of the Attorney General, which is again up for much criticism, and even areas such as legal education and the wider area of higher education.
The sum and substance of what Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has been telling us in the past weeks, in his many statements on the Geneva process and the necessity for political change, is that the country needs to change in every area of national importance. It is a revolution of very wide proportions; with the necessity to suspend disbelief that proper change can be achieved.
We cannot let the old hacks and new catchers of what is called the left, who made a disgrace of Parliament, mislead us into thinking that is neither leftist nor progressive, in the context of today’s needs.
We must look at the broader picture of progress that holds promise through the Commissions on Truth, Reconciliation and Compassion and other aspects of good governance. We must also look with speed at the changes the system and content of education, and the patterns of cultural thinking, that are demanded, by the increased violence in society and the growing call to take a step backwards in civilization to the death penalty. Let us look at Human Rights as the issue of major importance that can positively impact on progress in all aspects of society.
The country is on a threshold of change, calling to strengthen Human Rights and Social Justice. It is worth looking at what the old leaders of the left called for, and not the voices of those left behind.
