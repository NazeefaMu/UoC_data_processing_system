SL shines at JATA Tourism Expo in Japan

Sri Lanka’s pavilion was the highlight at Japan Tourism Expo, the biggest tourism event of Asia, which was held recently by Japan Association of Travel Agents (JATA) in Tokyo.
The fair, said to be the world’s largest tourism trade fair, is held annually during the last week of September in Tokyo’s Permanent Fair Ground known as Tokyo BigSite. Sri Lanka Tourism has always participated in the event with the main goal of promoting and introducing Sri Lanka’s cultural and historical attractions to the world.
The JATA Tourism Expo saw the participation of 17 DMC’s and a footfall reaching over 200 000. The exhibitors this year set a record number of business meeting appointments through the TEJ system. During the event, over 7,000 business meetings had taken place.
The Sri Lankan Ambassador to Japan, Prof Ganganath Disanayake speaking at the event said there is a common misconception among Japanese that Sri Lanka is part of the Indian continent, but only travellers to the island know just how distinct and diverse Sri Lanka is as an Island and country”.
The state Minister for Tourism Development in Sri Lanka Ranjith Aluvihare said, “The Japanese market is very important and I would like to see us build more partnerships to promote Sri Lanka among Japanese travellers.” He said.

The Sri Lankan delegation with Japanese counterparts:  State Minister of Tourism Development Hon. Ranjith Aluvihare, Monitoring MP for Tourism Sujith Perera, Chairman, Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau,  Dehan Senevirathne, Madubhani Perera, Director Marketing SLTPB and Kalpa Gunasinghe, Marketing Officer SLTPB.
To coincide with Sri Lanka’s participation at JATA, the Promotion Bureau also held two separate roadshows. The road show in Tokyo was held at the Intercontinental Tokyo Bay Hotel.
