Fireball dancer loses control

Over 20 children and young people sustained severe burn injuries when a wheel with fireballs carried by a traditional fireball dancer during a ceremony at a Hindu temple in Batticaloa area, went swirling into a group of onlookers.
The incident had happened on Saturday night close to midnight at the Unnichchai Sri Muthumariamman temple at the 7th mile post.
The dancer is said to have lost control of the wheel containing fireballs.
Nine of the severely burned young people were rushed to the Batticaloa Teaching Hospital and the rest were admitted to the Karadiyanaru Divisional Hospital said Aeythiyamalai Police.
Hospital sources said the people admitted to the Batticaloa hospital sustained severe burn injuries. Devotees of the temple had organised a procession with dancers for the ceremony held on Saturday. Aeythiyamalai Police are conducting further investigations.
