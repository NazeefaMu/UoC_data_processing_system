SriLankan Company Secretary to give more information on Regional Manager

Company Secretary of SriLankan Airlines Dalarene Thirukumar, giving evidence before the Presidential Commission on July 9, said she would inform the commissioner as to whether the SriLankan Airlines Regional Manager, who allegedly sexually abused an Indian woman in North India in 2014 and the officer who held various high posts in the Airline as revealed before the Commission, was one and the same person after perusing the relevant documents.
Additional Solicitor General Neil Unamboowe PC in his submissions said the former secretary to the Treasury Dr. P. B. Jayasundara had appointed two new directors to SriLankan Airlines by letter dated March 18, 2008 but the Company Secretary's file had certified the appointment letters with the March 17 date stamp. Submitting the relevant documents in court he asked Thirukumar how this had happened.
Thirukumar replied that she could not comment on the matter as she was not holding the post of Company Secretary at that time.
Additional Solicitor General Neil Unamboowe PC informed the commission that Treasury Secretary Dr. P.B. Jayasundera, through his relevant letters, had appointed Nishantha Wickramasinghe as Executive Director and Lalith de Silva as consultant but the appointment letters had entered the Company Secretary's file a day prior to the date of appointment mentioned in Dr. Jayasundera's letter.
He requested the commission to take this matter into consideration.
