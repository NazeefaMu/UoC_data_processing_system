Avant Garde employed over 2,000 Army deserters - Fonseka

The Avant Garde Company employed over 2,000 Army deserters and earned money illegally during the last three years, said Democratic Party leader Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka.
He said this matter could be investigated by checking the names of security guards the Company employed with the lists of the Army deserters in the Police.
Fonseka made these observations at a press conference at the Democratic Party headquarters at Pelawatta, Battaramulla yesterday.
"The Avant Garde employed more than 4,000 workers and 50 percent of them were Army deserters," Field Marshal Fonseka said. "It underpaid its employees and got the services of deserters getting the cover of the then Defence Secretary."
Fonseka said the head of the Avant Garde Company spoke to him over the telephone three days after the Presidential election and offered to fund his general election campaign fully.
"I said he could fund the construction of my Party Office but I would never call off investigations over allegations against him," Fonseka said. "However he did not call me later".
He said he was aware for whom Avant Garde funded during the last election campaigns.
"Did the UNPers vote for Wijayadasa Rajapaksa to protect Avant Garde Company and its leaders, Gotabhaya Rajapksha or any other corrupt Rajapaksa?" Field Marshal questioned. "Wijayadasa Rajapaksa says persons who speak against Avant Garde are those who were not funded by it".
Field Marshal Fonseka said the same statement implies that those who attempt to protect Avant Garde are those who are bribed.
