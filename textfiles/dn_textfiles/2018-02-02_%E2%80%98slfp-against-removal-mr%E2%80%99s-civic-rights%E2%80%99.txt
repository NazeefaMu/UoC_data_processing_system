‘SLFP against removal of MR’s civic rights’

The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) will not support the removal of civic rights of Mahinda Rajapaksa but legal action should be taken under civil and criminal laws against the former President, Highways State Minister Dilan Perera said.
Addressing a media briefing at the SLFP headquarters in Colombo yesterday, the State minister stressed that depriving a person’s of his or her civic rights was against the policies of the SLFP.
The Presidential Commission of Inquiry into Large Scale Corruption and Fraud (PRECIFAC) recommended that legal action be taken against MP Rajapaksa, his brothers and several ministers and officials of the previous regime over charges of corruption and fraud.
The SLFP will not take part in the process of depriving Rajapaksa of his civic rights but the SLFP stands for taking legal action under civil and criminal laws against the alleged financial malpractices of Rajapaksa, the State minister further explained.
