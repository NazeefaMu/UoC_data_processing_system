Cozier joins formidable squad up in the celestial commentary box

 
 Down on the beach, the pitch was gathering pace as the sand dried in the Caribbean heat.
Taking guard, the batsman noticed both men saving the single on the off-side were waist-high in the surf. A third, chortling behind the stumps, seemed to know what was coming next. Off his Sunday league run, former Pakistan Test bowler Sikhander Bakht didn’t bother with any kiss-the-surface nonsense, nor with back-of-a-length aiming for the top of off-stump.
It was a full bunger, head-high, and although the hapless striker tried to hook it off his nose, the tennis ball smacked him right between the eyes.
The gallery of spectators looking down from the garden of Tony Cozier’s beach house, on the windward coast of Barbados, roared with laughter as your correspondent was ‘sconned’ by an international cricketer for the first time.
Cozier later offered the befuddled hack another bottle of beer from the cool box, a fish cutter (the island’s signature snack) and a word of sage advice: “Never hook when the tide’s going out.”
On cricket tours of the Caribbean, Cozier’s beach party was always the best day of all – because he was as genial a host as he was in the commentary box.
When the West Indies were putting England to the sword in the 1980s with consecutive ‘Blackwash’ wipeouts, Cozier’s soundtrack on the radio was warm and soothing – like a doctor’s kind words as he cased your broken arm in plaster.
If you needed to know anything about West Indies cricket, Cozier’s was the first name you wanted on speed dial.
He was as proud of the island confederation dominating world cricket for 20 years towards the end of the 20 century as he was dismayed by its decline at Test level, although it would have warmed his heart to see the Windies win the World Twenty20 in such dramatic fashion six weeks ago.
Tony Cozier died on Wednesday in Barbados at the age of 75, and up in the celestial commentary box they are forming a formidable squad.
When rain stops play upstairs, Benaud, Martin-Jenkins, Greig and Cozier – to name just a few revered voices of cricket to fall silent in recent years – will be the million-dollar eavesdrop on Test Match Special. MIRROR
