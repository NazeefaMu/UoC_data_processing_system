Walk the word

Travelling back and forth between his home and the hospital in Maharagama was strenuous enough. With his father in a struggle between life and death, it turned out to be even worse. Plus, he had to take decisions – the most crucial ones. The stress engine has revved up to the full throttle.
But then that bundle of anxiety, stress, depression and weariness led him to a Shangri-La.
He began writing. That exercise came as a relief to rise above the adverse emotions. He sat down and went on writing. All that came to him spontaneously. And that’s how an Ashok Ferrey was born at the age of 42 to the Sri Lankan English literary sphere.
His latest work of fiction, The Ceaseless Chatter of Demons, has been longlisted for two international prizes: The DSC Prize longlist (the last 13 out of 60+ entries) and the Atta Galatta Bangalore Lit Fest Prize (the last 11 out of 120 entries).
The book will also be translated and published in France early next year, making it only the second indigenous Sri Lankan novel to have this honour – the first being Martin Wickremesinghe’s Viragaya, over 50 years ago. There have been a few expatriate writers of Sri Lankan origin whose novels have been translated and published in France. But they have been Sri Lankans who live in the UK, US, Australia and Canada, and are citizens of the respective countries - so not strictly speaking indigenous.
All this goes to show that Sri Lankan English writing is slowly and quietly making its way onto the world stage, Ferrey comments.
“I write well when I am sad. Sometimes it is just the right mood when I cannot sleep. You can never write well when basked in luxuries. In day-to-day life, we don’t find much peace. We should be able to blur everything else and zone in on our job. We need to be in the zone amid all that chaos of the surrounding,” Ferrey notes on writing.
But then he climbs on to another concept: the unconditioned mind, a must for a writer. Someone who had been starving for days would jump at whatever the food on hand. You might even wolf down cotton. But once hunger is satisfied you tend to have reservations about the very same food on your hand. You may not prefer chicken. A particular vegetable might be too sour. In such occurences, you cannot savour the real flavour.
The writer, in a similar vein, shall cultivate the habit of seeing things as they are. An individual is an individual; his profession and other matters are simply mundane. Without a conditioned mindset, the writer can observe an individual or a thing within a full scope.
From the unconditioned mindset, Ferrey descends to his home turf: writing.
When you are under stress, everything else comes to a rest, he reminds us. It applies to rewriting as well. But wait up, for Ferrey cautions!
“Sometimes you might be overwriting. Most writers tend to go on adding and adding. It gets only worse then. A genius excels in the art of cutting and cutting, while a novice knows how to go on adding and adding.”
And the remedy? Give your writing a break. It could be a day at first. Then give it a week. That done, revisit your manuscript after a month. It is a slow process. That is why fiction writing takes so long.
But will this theory apply to other types such as non-fiction and content writing as well?
“It is a different story. You do not need much time when you are working on writings other than fiction. Other writings require only a few pages. You can revise them conveniently. But what is most important is to know whether you have written too much or not.”
Ferrey names it too: overwrought. Although he has ample examples to quote, he would not dare do that. Writers will spot that in other writers, Ferrey notes, but he would not for the fear of making foes among his literary friends.
And that provides us with a clue as to why Sri Lankan English literature does not enjoy a comfortable presence on the global platform. However, there is more to come from Ferrey in his dissection of where we might have erred.
“Many of us – me included – want to run before the walk. Take those artists on the pavement by the Art Gallery for instance. Most of those paintings belong to the movement of cubism. Most paintings look exactly like what George Keyt drew. But what we need to remember is that Keyt mastered the traditional painting first, before moving on to cubism. But when we see a cubist or an abstract painting, we feel as if we can do that too.”
If painting is writing, then you assume you can indulge in postmodernist, absurd and other contemporary genres. But you need to have your tools – grammar, vocabulary and structure – in order. You need to learn the rules to a professional extent, and then you can break them like an artist.
“There is absolutely nothing wrong with experimenting. In fact, it is a good thing to see experiments. But we tend to forget that we should know our craft really well. That’s not our fault though. We have a huge dearth of English teachers. Many newspapers do not have proofreaders. When a child reads a newspaper article full of bad mistakes, they will learn those mistakes.”
In an encounter with a foreign head teacher, Ashok Ferrey has come to know the primary difference between the local O-Ls and the foreign A-Ls. The local students enter the examination with a vocabulary of 14000 words while the foreign counterparts are equipped with a vocabulary of 18000 words. The difference has created a huge impact.
“And the politicians! They put English in cold storage during the 50s, the 60s and the 70s. Before then we were very much ahead of Singapore and India. Whenever I go to India or Bangalore, it is such a joy to read their newspapers. It does not mean that they are cleverer than us. Their contents are sometimes stupider than that of our newspapers. But it is the style they adopt. They have excellent proofreaders and editors. We suffer from that dearth because English was snatched away from us.”
But Ferrey wants us to rest assured for we are slowly recovering. The recovery is most definite because we are a bright nation.
During the creative writing workshops, Ferrey would ask the participants to select five books they really like. Put them before you - he would ask the participants - and think over why you like them. Try to spot the common features. That is the trick of identifying your own voice as a would-be writer.
“The voice is essential. Having a story alone will not suffice. You should have a voice to support your style. The voice comes to surface once you go on writing. You should have your story as well as the voice on a fifty-fifty basis. When you read widely, your style will come to you naturally. It will come soon if you are lucky.”
We need to read the likes of Charles Dickens and Henry James to understand how verbose they are, Ferrey offers advice. We need to move on to the contemporary writers such as Salman Rushdie to understand his mastery of wordplay. “I won’t call Rushdie verbose. His is a brilliant wordplay. That wordplay is something that neither Dickens nor James could accomplish.”
Among the local wordsmiths, Ferrey is enamoured by Tissa Abeysekara for his simple and poetic style adopted in Bringing Tony Home. It is simply the way that the writer puts the words together. Sometimes I am not satisfied with one adjective, Ashok remarks, and replace it with another.
A writer is a magician. He makes something, which you are well familiar with, disappear and makes something else appear unbeknownst to you. He can make an elephant appear without your knowledge. But then some writers keep on alerting you of an elephant about to appear. When the elephant appears at last, there is nothing to marvel at.
Such writers, Ashok Ferrey warns, are the bad guys.
