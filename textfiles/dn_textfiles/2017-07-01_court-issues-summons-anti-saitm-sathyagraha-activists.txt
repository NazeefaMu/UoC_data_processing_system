Court issues summons on anti-SAITM Sathyagraha activists

Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne yesterday, issued summons on six activists who are currently engaging in a Sathyagraha campaign against the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine Limited (SAITM), opposite the Fort Railway Station.
Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne made this order persuant to a request made by the Railway Department which had alleged that a stage erected on a land belonging to the Railways Department opposite the Fort Railway Station was causing disturbance to the people.
Accordingly, Dr. Hemantha de Silva, the Chairman of the Parents’ Union, Wasantha Sarojani, Deshan Simron, Deepthi Wijeratne, Buddhima Madushanka and Sameera Dilshan were ordered to appear in Courts on July 14.
Last Thursday, the Fort Magistrate had issued an order directing the 11 activists to take steps to remove the platform of the protesters which has been set up opposite the Fort Railway Station.
Assistant Superintendent of Railway Protection Force Lalith Kumara maintained that the stage has been erected on land belonging to the Railways Department and they received complaints against this campaign and they acted to bring the matter before Courts accordingly.
