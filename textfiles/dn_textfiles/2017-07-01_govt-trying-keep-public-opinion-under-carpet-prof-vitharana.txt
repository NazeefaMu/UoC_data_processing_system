Govt trying to keep public opinion under carpet: Prof. Vitharana

The Government does not like to reveal the country what the people think about the Government by trying to postpone the Local Government election for another two or three years, LSSP Leader Prof. Tissa Vitharana said.
Addressing the media at the LSSP Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the LG polls would be delayed for another two or three years if the percentage of members elected from wards is reduced from 70 percent to 60 percent proposed by the UNP, JVP, SLMC and a few other political parties. The delimitation process should be done again, he said.
According to Prof. Vitharana, dengue is raising its head in the country because there are no people's representatives in LG bodies to carry out dengue control activities. The Health Minister should provide equipment to test blood in hospitals to identify dengue patients, he said. Prof. Vitharana said funds should be allocated to the Disaster Management Ministry to provide homes for the victims of natural disasters.
