Drug prices raised by 5%

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said prices of 48 drugs have been raised by five percent to prevent local importers from incurring losses.
This is due to the continuously rising prices of medicine in the global market.
Dr. Senaratne said prices were raised in accordance with a request made by local pharmaceutical companies importing drugs. The importers are making losses due to the price increase in drugs in the global market.
The price increase will be valid for one year with no price increase again even the prices of drugs in the global market increase in future (during the year). The prices of 48 drugs were reduced significantly on October 21 in 2016 (one year and two months ago), he said.
Earlier the price of a paracetamol tablet was Rs. 1.30 and now it is only Rs. 1.37 (only seven cents increased). All pharmacies should sell the drugs according to the prices in the Special Gazette Notification 2049/31 of December 14. The National Medicine Regulatory Authority (NMRA) will conduct raids to nab pharmacies which sell drugs at higher prices than gazetted, he added.
