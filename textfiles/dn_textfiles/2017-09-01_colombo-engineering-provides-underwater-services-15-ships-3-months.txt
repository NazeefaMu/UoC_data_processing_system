Colombo Engineering provides  underwater services to 15 ships in 3 months

 Turning out to be a major foreign exchange earner to Sri Lanka, Colombo Engineering, an MTD WALKERS Group company located inside the Port of Colombo and classed as one of the most sophisticated afloat ship service organizations in Sri Lankan waters, provided underwater services to 15 ships within the past three months.
“Positive and dynamic international marketing was the result of the company securing business to the country amidst stiff competition from neighbouring countries in the South Asian region,” an elated CEO Kiran Atapattu said.
Atapattu also went on to say that after getting the business to the country the efficient and speedy response of their skilled and professional service mattered as top priority.
The company in the past has won 50 top class business awards for recognition of its export-oriented services and the foreign exchange earned to the country.
