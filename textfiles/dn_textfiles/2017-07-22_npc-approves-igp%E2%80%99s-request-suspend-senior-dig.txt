NPC approves IGP’s request to suspend Senior DIG

The National Police Commission has approved a request forwarded by Inspector General of Police Pujitha Jayasundara in writing to suspend Senior D.I.G. Lalith Jayasinghe from his duties.
Senior D.I.G. Lalith Jayasinghe was arrested on July 15, 2017, in connection with helping a person who was a suspect in the murder of schoolgirl “Sivaloganathan Vidya” in Jaffna.
The 18-year-old schoolgirl “Vidya” was abducted, raped and murdered while she was on her way home from school. The incident which took place on May 13, 2015 had spread throughout the country, including the international community. However, the Police were able to arrest 9 suspects who were indicted over the murder.
The main suspect related to the incident was captured by residents of the area and later handed over to the relevant authorities, but was later released by the Kayts Police.
