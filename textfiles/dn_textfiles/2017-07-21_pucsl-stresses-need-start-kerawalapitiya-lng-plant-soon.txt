PUCSL stresses on need to start Kerawalapitiya LNG plant soon

The Director General of the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) yesterday warned that the Kerawalapitiya Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) plant would need to be started soon if they are to keep to the CEB’s timeline of commissioning it by 2019.
Plans for the 300MW LNG plant was put on hold last week after certain irregularities were found in the tender procedure to select the company which would construct the plant. The plant has been in the planning stage for the last 10 years.
“We have to award it now if we expect to keep to the timeline. It is still not clear whether there is a delay but there is a dilemma. The Procurement Committee has to decide on that and they have to decide soon,” PUCSL Director General Damitha Kumarasinghe said yesterday addressing a media briefing on the Commission’s decision on the Ceylon Electricity Boards’ (CEB) Least Cost Long Term Generation Expansion Plan (LCLTGEP). The scenario they approved, removes coal out of the picture and has LNG play a big role in the country’s energy mix in the next 20 years.
“Kerawalapitiya is the first LNG plant proposed in the CEB plan,” the DG said explaining that given the time constraints, the CEB had proposed that it be a dual fuel plant in the short term. The PUCSL has continuously warned that the country would face an energy crisis soon if they did not keep to the approved generation plans and implement what has been proposed. Over the last 20 years, the country has had to resort to diesel and thermal power plants to meet increasing power needs as the long term power plants proposed for over 20 years have not materialized.
“The situation we are here right now, whatever the reasons, is due to non-implementation.
In the 2013 plan, we spoke of Sampur, we expected it again in 2015, then in the 2018 plan we expected it in 2021. Subsequently it was taken off. If Sampur had been there by 2018, we would not need to be talking about diesel plants now but since it is not there, we need to bridge the gap quickly,” Kumarasinghe said.
