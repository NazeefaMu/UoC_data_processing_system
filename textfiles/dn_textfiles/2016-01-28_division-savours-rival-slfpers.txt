Division savours the rival - SLFPers

When considering the behaviour of Sri Lankan politics, it can be analyzed in such a way that the benefit of dividing a major political party goes to the major rival political party, Ministers Anura Priyadarshna Yapa and Dayasiri Jayasekara said.
The ministers were addressing the weekly media briefing of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) at the SLFP headquarters yesterday.
Minister Yapa highlighting the political history of the country pointed out that at every time when a major political party was divided, the other rival party got the benefit of that division.
He said the SLFP was divided by various people from 1977 to 1994 resulting in a severe impact to the party. In certain occasions, several SLFPers formed other parties.
“For instance, People’s Party (Mahajana Pakshaya) was formed under the leadership of Vijaya Kumaratunga, Chandrika Kumaratunga and T. B. Illangaratne in 1984. However, Chandrika Kumaratunga returned to the party and became the President and the leader of the SLFP. Similar to this incident, a new party was formed by several frontline UNPers such as Lalith Athulathmudali, Gamini Dissanayake, etc.,” he said.
If the SLFP is divided, the UNP will definitely be benefited at the forthcoming local government election, Minister Yapa added.
When the minister was asked by the media about the outcome of the recently held Executive Meeting of the SLFP, he said that no idea came up regarding forming a new political party.
“At the meeting nine proposals were tabled to be presented to the Constitutional Council. The President said that Geneva issue will be addressed under local legal provisions,” Yapa said.
All members should abide by the decisions of party leadership, Central or Executive Committees. The SLFP has engaged in a coalition government on a decision by the Central Committee, he said.
Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said the SLFP will be defeated at elections if it is divided. Whatever party is formed, the UNP and the SLFP will rule the country at least for the next 40 - 50 years.
“Many parties were formed time and again by many persons. Except for a few parties, all others have ceased to exist. If an SLFPer formed a new party dividing the SLFP, it can be considered that the particular member is ruining the SLFP. Therefore work with the head but not with heart,” he said.
When he was questioned about allegations leveled by SLFP Parliamentarian Dullas Allahapperuma that President Maithripala Sirisena removed the bra of the SLFP and throw it to the UNP by forming a coalition government with the UNP, the minister said that Allahapperuma also expressed his concerns at the Central Committee to go for coalition government with the UNP.
“If it is so, it indicates that Allahapperuma has also joined in removing the bra,” he said.
Parliamentarian Lakshman Senevirathne said that UNP had been in the opposition for 20 years as a result of the internal disputes. Therefore all SLFP members should be in brotherly manner with the aim of achieving common goals.
