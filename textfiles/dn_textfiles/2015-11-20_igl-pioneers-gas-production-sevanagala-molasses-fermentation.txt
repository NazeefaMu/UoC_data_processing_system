IGL pioneers gas production from Sevanagala molasses fermentation

Industrial Gases Ltd. (IGL) will partner with Sri Lanka Sugar Company (A 100% Government owned entity), in pioneering a project involving the installation of its own plant with state-of-the-art environmental-friendly technology enabling a more cost effective method of capturing CO2 emitted during the molasses fermentation process at Sevanagala Sugar Plantations.
IGLChairman Sumith Guruge said they are pleased to be the pioneers of such projects; this being the first of its kind in Sri Lanka, and are excited about the potential opportunities for their enterprise in this sector.
"Capturing the CO2 that is otherwise released into the atmosphere will help reduce this emission into the environment that could result in harmful effects. In addition to contributing towards reduction in CO2 imports, we hope to provide a boost to the economy as a result of this venture. The combination of IGL's financial strength and development capability together with the specialist knowledge and experience of the best engineering team will help to position us as the leading CO2 manufacturer in this sector."
Gas World Pvt. Ltd., which is under the IGL umbrella, recently launched the supply of medical gases to private and government health sector establishments.
CO2 production is estimated at around 200 to 300 tons of CO2 per month. IGL will in addition, provide Sri Lanka Sugar Co. the opportunity of obtaining carbon credit in lieu of this operation.
As part of IGL's acceleration of its plan for growth and development, this undertaking provides advanced capabilities from a dedicated on-site supply of CO2 liquid gas anytime, anywhere. Commercial production is presently underway after extensive pilot testing and final commissioning of the production process.
The resulting CO2 is trapped, cleaned and safely stored in special storage tanks which would be delivered to any part of the country by the company's efficient fleet of bowsers.
The commissioning of this vital project provides efficient facilities for CO2 manufacture and storage, backed by standardized technologies that ensure reliability and safety while optimizing logistics. Installation of the plant was carried out by IGL engineering staff under the supervision of the manufacturers.
Major equipment is PLC controlled with automatic operation designed to produce the highest quality and purity that is compatible for the food and beverage industry. Other sectors that would benefit from this project are the welding industry, fish exports, airline industry and courier sector, in addition to the servicing of fire extinguishing systems, carbonation of soft drinks, freezing of food products.
