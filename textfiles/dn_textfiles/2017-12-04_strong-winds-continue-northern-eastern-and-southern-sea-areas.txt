Strong winds to continue in Northern, Eastern and Southern sea areas

 
Strong winds are expected to increase particularly in the Northern, Eastern and Southern sea areas from tomorrow due to the development of a low pressure area in the South Andaman Islands the Meteorology Department said.
Fairly heavy rains or thundershowers of above 75mm are expected in Northern, North-Central, Eastern and Uva provinces.
Gusty winds of 50kmph are expected in the Western, Sabaragamuwa and Uva provinces and in Ampara and Batticaloa districts.
The Meteorology Department urged the public to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by lightning activity.
