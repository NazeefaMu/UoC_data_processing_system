Nature is a part and parcel of human life, so we are duty bound to conserve and love it with much enthusiasm, said Moneragala District Secretary D.S.Pathmakulasuriya.
He was speaking at a tree planting campaign held last Monday at Moneragala Maduruketiya School under the 'A Plant for US' project, parallel to the National Environment Conservation Programme organized by the Presidential Secretariat office. The District Secretary said at present we experience a severe environmental inequality and it is a timely need to a bring firm solution by planting trees and conserving the environment with love and care.
“The participation of students in the tree planting has an immense impact as it helps to create an environment-friendly young generation who are sensitive to environment-related issues in future,” the Secretary said. The District Secretary emphasized the importance of moulding the young generation towards environment conservation.
Over 1,000 students of 15 selected schools who were admitted to Grade One from different Divisional Secretariat areas in Moneragala were given fruit plants and coconut saplings under the project organized by the Moneragala District Secretariat office in collaboration with the Divisional Secretariat offices and Moneragala Zonal Education office.
The Presidential Secretariat office earmarked Rs, 2,27,272.00 for this project.
