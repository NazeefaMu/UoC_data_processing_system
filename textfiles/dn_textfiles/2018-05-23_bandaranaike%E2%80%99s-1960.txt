Bandaranaike’s 1960

Playwright, dramatist, actor, lyricist and radio artist, Dayananda Gunawardena’s first outstanding play was 'Nari Bena' (1960). Based on a folk-tale it was full of songs. Lionel Algama’s music added extra elegance to this play – two songs, ‘Kumatada Sobaniye Kandulu Salanne’ (do not sob beloved) and 'Ehela Malin Gas Pirila Balanna Hari Lassanai' (it’s a spectacular view of blooming Ehela trees in the vicinity) became extremely popular, the play continues to be staged for over fifty years.
When a few veteran stage actors sang ‘Kumatada Sobhaniye Kandulu Salanne…’, in a TV programme recently, I reminisced of the year 1960, when two general elections followed the assassination of Prime Minister SWRD Bandaranaike a few months before.
General perception within the electorate was that the last nail into the UNP’s casket had been driven in 1956. The SLFP, Bandaranaike’s new party swept the polls capturing control with all senior UNP ministers losing their territories except Sir John Kothalawala, the PM. Sir John Kotalawala dissolved the Parliament hastily in March 1956 and called for fresh elections. SWRD grabbed the opportunity to form a grand alliance with a few other nationalists and left parties to meet the UNP led by Sir John and his deputy JR Jayewardene in the absence of Dudley Senanayake who bid good-bye to politics a couple of years before. He named it Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP, led by SLFP). The MEP invited the LSSP and CP, the two Marxist parties to go into a no-contest deal for defeating the ‘common enemy’ at the elections.
Multi-party politics
With the assassination of Prime Minister Bandaranaike in September 1959, Ceylon as a nation faced confusion and instability. However, the well-established institution of parliamentary multi-party politics proved strong. The orderly constitutional process resolved the transfer of leadership and the office of Prime Minister was passed on to Wijaynanda Dahanayake, a non-SLFPer and leader of ‘Bhasha Peramuna’ (Language front), a constituent party in the MEP, he was the most senior parliamentarian, in the absence of SLFP’s second in command and leader of the house CP de Silva, who was hospitalized in London.
Policy and personality clashes among the ruling coalition’s hierarchy forced the new leader to dissolve Parliament prematurely in December 1959. By this time the SLFP became extremely unpopular with the unfolding of evidence in the assassination case, that almost all the accused belonged to SLFP hierarchy.
As Sirimavo, the widow of slain PM, Bandaranaike declined the offer of party leadership; the SLFP during the elections was led by its deputy, C P de Silva. Bandaranaike, however, during the latter part of the campaign reluctantly agreed to appear on election platform. Her tears and grieving over the killing of her husband’s created a wave of sympathy which drew massive crowds. The government film unit produced a well directed short film titled, “Gamanaka Awasanaya” (Journey’s end) on Bandaranaike, his assassination and the funeral and it was shown free of charge at all film halls in the island in between the normal film show times. Crowds thronged to watch the 25-minute clip. The short-lived Dahanayake government was defeated by the UNP in the March 1960 general elections.
Sirimavo’s late entry, however, as an outsider was not sufficient to account for the required number, the SLFP securing only 30 seats against UNP’s 50, in a 125-member House. Dudley Senanayake who was brought back to politics by the party men was sworn in as PM in a minority government.
The new Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake Government’s overall parliamentary majority, in terms of the number of seats, being below the minimum requirement was defeated at the vote on the Throne Speech (Policy Statement), within a month from its formation. Then there were no ‘jumping frogs’; Also, politics was then more or less totally the province of men who were by now rich, not of those on the make, so the scope for personal monetary corruption was much less. Representatives were motivated by loyalty to the party that is untainted by the ‘under-the-table’ deals.
PR system
With the fall of the UNP government, a second general election became mandatory: it was fixed for July 1960. The elections were held in quick succession in March and July, as the March election failed to elect a winning party with an absolute majority. The writer was preparing for his O/L examination when the Dudley Senanayake’s one-month-old minority government collapsed at the vote on Crown Speech.
On this occasion, the assassinated Prime Minister’s widow, Sirimavo Rattwatte Dias Bandaranaike, with the support of few other smaller parties with both right and left leanings, agreed to carry on the mandate of her husband. On July 20th, helped by public sympathy, the SLFP won 75 seats out of 98 fielded, though they obtained only 33.6 percent of the total votes cast. Meanwhile, the UNP contested 128 seats won only 30 but raked in 37.6 percent of the valid votes, a remarkable discrepancy that justified introduction of the Proportional Representation (PR) system in later years. The LSSP and the CP entered into a no-contest pact with the SLFP and fielded 28 candidates, of which the LSSP and the CP won 12 and 4 seats respectively. Sirimavo Bandaranaike took oaths as the Prime Minister of Ceylon and gained the unprecedented honour of being the world's first woman head of state, an exceptional distinction welcomed universally.
The second election was fixed for July 20 under a UNP caretaker government; and the campaign commenced, which used and abused the state Radio, Lake House and the Times Group the only media available then to vilify, insult and vituperate Sirimavo, who on this occasion accepted the leadership and campaigned enthusiastically for her party.
SWRD’s life and assassination
“Kumatada Sobhaniye Kandulu Salanne” was played ad nauseam over the two channels at Radio Ceylon, the sole electronic media, and the then Care-taker government banned the short film ‘Journey’s end’ on SWRD’s life and assassination. This gave the novice Sirimavo, the ‘iron lady’ all the dynamism, vitality, courage and determination in leading the SLFP to win 75 seats out of 146, a clear ruling majority and she set an everlasting world record as ‘First Woman Head of State’.
The campaign carried out by the government in July 1960, by banning the documentary, ‘JOURNEY'S END’ and abusing the state media to repeat Nari Bena song ‘Kumatada sobhanye kandulu salnney’ had negative impact on them; this reminds one, the much worse abusive and discourteous strategies adopted by the Rajapaksas during Presidential elections in January 2015.
Such undignified and reprehensible methods as well as attempts to postpone elections in the past always did boomerang on the ruling party causing victory to the opposition. Will they ever learn lessons?
