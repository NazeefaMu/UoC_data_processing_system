Cable car service won’t be at Sirigiriya

Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam yesterday said he, as the Chairperson of the Sri Lanka National Commission for UNESCO, will not allow any activity that damage Sigiriya.
The Minister said that no permission was granted for a cable car project at Sigiriya.
He said several media reported a proposal to start a cable car project with the permission of the Central Cultural Fund officials. He said the Central Cultural Fund and the Archeological Department were under him and the project would damage the status of the world heritage site of Sigiriya.
Now the Central Cultural Fund and the Archeological Department are vested with Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe. Any proposal for a cable car project would come under the Minister and he will look into the report that a Chinese company has conducted a feasibility study for cable car project at Sigiriya. He will defiantly reveal the truth about the incident later.
Minister Kariyawasam said that some elements are trying to use this incident to create a conflict between him and Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe. They try to show that the government is conspiring to destroy the world heritage sites.
“I categorically condemn this kind of dirty politics and media manipulation. The government is committed to protect world heritages sites and will not allow anyone to destroy them,” the Minister said.
“Today we have to face adverse consequences of the illegal and haphazard constructions built during the Rajapaksa regime to gain political mileages,” he said.
