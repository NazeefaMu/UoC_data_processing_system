NW province farmers ask for fertliser subsidy

Farmers in several areas in the North Western Province undergo severe difficulties since they lack fertiliser for their cultivation.
Members of Hiriyala, Galewela, Devahuwa and Siyabalangamuwa farmer associations met the Kurunegala District Secretary and the Agrarian Services Deputy Commissioner seeking fertiliser subsidies They said they will be affected very much if fertilizer subsidy is not provided on time.
The Lak Pohora Company lacks enough fertiliser stocks and a company distributes fertiliser, the farmers complain.
They allege that in certain areas a bag of fertiliser is sold at different prices even though the government stipulated a fixed price.
