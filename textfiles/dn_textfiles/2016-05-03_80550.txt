LG polls early next year: Faiszer

The Local Government polls will be held early next year once the delimitation process is completed, Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Mustapha said.
“The SLFP or the government does not fear holding the LG elections as said by some at May Day rallies,” he said at a press briefing in Colombo yesterday.
Musthapha said holding LG polls according to the old system without completing the delimitation process was going against the people’s mandate given to President Maithripala Sirisena during the Presidential election.
The minister said even the UPFA General Secretary wanted to hold the LG polls soon as the UPFA had the advantage of winning the election.
“It cannot be done as protecting people’s democratic rights is more important than following time frames. There are over 2,000 complaints with the Delimitation Commission. Some ethnicities do not have a representation in some electorates,” he said. Minister Mustapha said one more month will be given to the commission from August 1 to complete its work.
“Delimitation should be done for more than 1,000 electorates. I do not interfere with the committee which is represented by all political parties. Nobody was against holding LG polls according to the new system when the issues was taken up in Parliament,” he said.
