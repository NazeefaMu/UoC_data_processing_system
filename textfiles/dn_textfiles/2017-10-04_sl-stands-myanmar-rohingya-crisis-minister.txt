SL stands by Myanmar in Rohingya crisis - Minister

Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe yesterday stressed that the Sri Lankan Government stands by the Myanmar Government’s position with regard to the Rohingya crisis.
The minister defended the recent statement of Nobel Peace Prize Winner Aung San Suu Kyi on the Rohingya people.
“Sri Lanka has strong bilateral relations with Myanmar. As a Theravadi Buddhist country, Sri Lanka has historical ties with Myanmar.
We can relate Myanmar’s situation to what we experienced during the war time. I can recall the false charges and misinterpretation of facts Sri Lanka faced during those times.Suu Kyi has faced a similar situation now.However, she has assured that no Rohingya person is looked down upon and that the Government would investigate if anybody has subjected to persecution,” the minister noted.
Commenting on President Maithripala Sirisena being nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, the minister said it was a great achievement that the whole country could be proud of. “It was for the first time in history that a leader of our country was shortlisted for it. It reflects the international recognition he enjoys,” he stated.
