Creative Software expands office space

A leading IT company Creative Software, formerly known as Creative Solutions, has doubled their office space to accommodate their rapidly growing teams and client base.
The expansion has generated attractive employment opportunities for software professionals and recent graduates looking to grow their careers in “an informal, fun and creative work environment” as the company describes it.
“Given our growth rate, we have had to upgrade to an eight-storey R&D centre. We will continue to grow and create many job opportunities this year,” said Director Sushena Ranatunga.
To fill their modern and spacious new premises in the heart of Colombo, the company announced that it will be recruiting aggressively throughout the year.
Channa De Silva, Creative Software’s director of software engineering, explained the company’s ideal candidate profile. According to him, knowledge and experience alone are not enough; Creative Software looks for specific personal traits as well.
“We look for true passion,” said De Silva.“Passion coupled with a ‘can-do’ attitude, team spirit and creativity are key ingredients to succeed at Creative Software. Those values have made Creative Software a leader in its field.”
When asked about his advice to applicants, De Silva encouraged all creative and passionate software professionals and graduates to apply.
