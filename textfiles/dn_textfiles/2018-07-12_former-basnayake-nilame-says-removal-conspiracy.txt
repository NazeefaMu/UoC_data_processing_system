Former Basnayake Nilame says removal a conspiracy

Former Basnayake Nilame of the Ruhunu Maha Kataragama Devalaya D.P. Kumarage said that although three months had lapsed since he was removed from the Basnayake Nilame post, no disciplinary inquiry had been held so far. As such, he considered his removal as part of a major conspiracy.
He said he was removed with the assurance that an investigation would be conducted in three months and a decision would be made consequently. As nothing had been done in this direction so far, it was incumbent on the Buddhasasana Minister to reinstate him in the post.
He said this after he called on the Malwatte and Asgiriya Prelates at their temples in Kandy and received their blessings yesterday.
