Siva takes charge of  Old Trinitians Rugby Scrummage

One of the finest rugby forwards of the mid 1980’s Duraisamy Sivasubramaniam was elected as chairman of the Old Trinitians Rugby Scrummage at their Annual General Meeting held last Saturday at the at the Orient Club. The previous committee under Dharshan Munasinghe from 2016/17 resigned to make way for the next OTRS Committee to establish themselves.
Siva, as he is popularly known was a top front row forward who sported Trinity College jersey in 1983, for the first time under the leadership of Ashan Ratwatte, and some of his first team mates were R. Gunasekara, Rohan Abeyakoon, D. Ratwatte, Hassan Ally, Manoj Jayatissa, J. Hadunge, J. Perera. In his first year he won his colors and the following year 1984 he led the side in five games when the regular captain was injured, and guided Trinity to win the Cannon R de Saram Shield against S. Thomas’ College.
That is the year he won the coveted Lion and it was the one and only award for that season. He played for Outstation Schools against Colombo Schools in the Gratiaen Cup and also for the Combined Schools XV. Straight from school he joined Kandy Sports Club and played for many years and also for Up-Country, and later was in the committee, as a committee member, treasurer, vice president and rugby chairman for well over ten years. It was under his chairmanship that Kandy SC won the first League title in 1994. He was involved with Kandy SC for nearly 25 years. He was also the Up Country Lions SC chairman. So, with his experience he is sure to continue the good work done by the past chairman.
New appointees to the Scrummage apart from the chairman are: Vice Chairmen: Adrain Basnayake, a prop forward and Channa Pathirana, a second row forward, Secretary: Dinesh Nugegoda played as a forward, Treasurer: Amil Ramanathan a good runner as wing-three-quarter. Filling the role as committee members are M.T.L.J. Perera a top full back, N.L.K. Ratnayake a talented wing-three-quarter, Jannindra Dunwuille hooked well during his days, Thaksala Hettiarachchi second row, Shalindra Wickramasiri a center, Murad Ramzeen third row forward and Hariss Omar a talented third row forward.
Old Trinitians Rugby Scrummage (OTRS) is an organization affiliated to the Old Boys Association of Trinity College Kandy and manages rugby across all age groups at the school under the guidance of the principal. It remains responsible in the areas of management, administration and coaching of rugby at Trinity. From the day, they started this Scrummage; it has been good for Trinity rugby in all forms of the game. The main object of the Scrummage is to promote the advancement and progress of rugby, within the means of the rugby Scrummage, in concurrence with the Principal, to enlist the support of the former rugby players of the school to Trinity College, foster fellowship among all former players and to raise funds in support of Trinity rugby.
Rugby Scrummage was the brainchild of Kenneth Boteju who played for Trinity in the late 1940’s as a wing three quarter. Boteju started it around 1992 together with his friend Rajah ‘Dabar’ Adihetty. He gathered around some former players including M.T.M. Zaruk, Dr. Robert Soujha, Dr. Abeyratne, Dr. Kenneth Gunawardena, Wilhelm Balthazar, Ken de Joodt. Dr. Robert Soujha was the first chairman with Dr. Kenneth Gunawardena as vice chairman, Kenneth Boteju as secretary, Dabar Adihetty as treasurer. With a fifteen member committee in the next few years many stalwarts like Jayantha Jayawardena, Jayantissa Ratwatta, Indrajith Balasooriya who travelled all the way from Matara for meetings joined in.
The aim was to help in all aspects of rugby, in an advisory capacity and financially wherever possible and also getting together and fellowship of all former players.
In those early years a few small projects were tried out to collect some money, mugs, ceramic wall-hangings of the Bradby Shield, etc. Later on the younger ex players took over the Committee.
