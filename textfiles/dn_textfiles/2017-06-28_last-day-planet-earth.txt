Last day on planet earth

Since his childhood, he had been interested in reading books on science fiction, science magazines and astronomy. His interest in Astronomy led him to avidly research on the books about planets and Space. The more he read, the more interested he became.
The Last Days on Planet Earth, a science fiction narrative authored by Udaya Thalangama, will be launched at National Library and Documentation Services Board on July 6 at 5 pm as a Sadeepa publication.
Udaya Thalangama who is a graduate in BSc in Computer Science from the University of Colombo is currently employed as a Senior Software Engineer at a leading Bank in Sri Lanka.
When he heard about the Planet X or Nibiru in 2007, he started deep research into this subject to find out what the ancient civilisation like Sumerians, Mayans and Hopi Indians knew about Nibiru and how those civilisations got wiped out due to Cosmic Events. He has mainly focused on the Sumerian Culture in order to find out what the Sumerian tablets and their text in stones had mentioned about Nibiru more than 6000 years ago, based on the books written by Zecharia Sitchin, the linguist who published many books on Sumerians and Nibiru,
He explored what the Ancient text say about Nibiru, what the Bible, Veda and other historical books had revealed about Nibiru.
He has devised his own mathematical models and software applications in order to analyse the behaviour and the orbital path of Nibiru and also to find out the time period of next fly-by of Nibiru.
After the completion of his analysis of this information for a period of more than 10 years, he decided to publish a book which will reveal the evidence of the arrival of Nibiru.
If you have not noticed lately, nature is speaking out to us. It appears that our planet is spiralling out of control, that is influenced by the cosmic force, which affects the inner core of the earth, and thus affecting the earth’s magnetic field allowing harmful radiation to permeate the earth atmosphere and subsequently endangering the health of the earth inhabitants. It is what we call the dominant effect, in which one concrete object is responsible for the collapse of all other objects in its path.
What exactly is happening around the world at this time? Well, not much of these are covered in the mainstream media. But if you follow the social media or alternative news sites, then you will come to know that there are significant events taking place at this time. The question is whether the world is entering a series of cataclysm events or not.
Since the 1990s, natural disasters have consistently increased, and have affected more than 500 Million people every year. And the numbers continue to increase. This category falls into a category of apocalyptic. This is what we need to focus. If you consider the overall geological disasters in that time frame, then the numbers have remained fairly constant. If we then take, the related climate number of disasters, you will see that the numbers have drastically increased. When we refer to earth changes, it is believed that the world would enter a series of cataclysmic events that would cause major alterations on the planet.
If you go through our climate, the atmosphere and the changes that are taking place both on the surface of the earth and below the surface, couldn’t get any worst. Then you may pay a close attention and read this book.
There are countless prophecies about future times, but only one is repeated across many cultures: the arrival of a huge planet whose magnetism will alter our world. Since ancient times this planet has been known as Nibiru or Hercólubus. However, it is recognised in many traditions, prophecies and sacred books under different names such as Planet X, Nibiru, Baal, Wormwood, Marduk, Nemesis, The Beast, Red Planet, The Planet of crossing and much more.
Nibiru is a gigantic world, it is bigger than earth. In the past, it put an end to the Atlantean civilisation and it is approaching Earth again. In its present encounter, the progressive approach of Nibiru will bring about all type of volcanic eruptions, earthquakes and tidal waves, which will become more and more infrequent and intense until total devastation come about. The approach of Nibiru is an event that will cause deep changes on our planet. Regarding celestial mechanics, Nibiru will help the pole shift. Indeed, it is a part of the great machinery.
When Nibiru comes closer to the Earth and aligns with the Sun, deadly epidemics will begin to spread over the entire planet. Neither doctors nor official science will know what sort of illnesses they are or how to cure them. They will be powerless in the face of the epidemics.
“The moment of tragedy and darkness will come tremors, earthquakes, Volcanoes and tidal waves. “What I am affirming in this book is a prophecy that will be fulfilled very shortly, because I am certain about the end of the planet; I know it. I am not frightening, but warning, because I am distressed about this poor Humanity. These events will not be long in coming and there is no time to waste with illusory things.”
