Sustainability  on a platter

The Road to Rights became a finalist of the United Nations SDG Action Awards under the Mobilizer category. The Awards recognizes the most outstanding and innovative efforts to inspire action on the Sustainable Development Goals, a set of goals adopted by countries to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all, as part of a new sustainable development agenda.
The Awards are powered by the United Nations SDG Action Campaign. Winners will be announced at the Awards Ceremony on March 21, during the second edition of the Global Festival of Action for Sustainable Development, the world’s annual gathering to catalyze action for the SDGs, happening in Bonn, Germany from March 21 to 23.
‘The Road to Rights’ is a unique platform where ideas are pumped from the youth. As a youth-led organization ‘The Road to Rights’ work to educate and empower the younger generation through human rights education and 2030 agenda. They believe that understanding of basic values would lead to a society where people respect and love each other, especially respect everyone’s independence. If the SDGs are achieved, eventually human right will be preserved. With that objective, they are working on incorporating SDGs into different types of institutions, as they believe institutionalizing SDGs would bring strong impacts. They are also working on building the capacity of the younger generation from different parts of the country so that they will be able to take their own actions mobilizing their own resources. They educate, inspire, and empower people while addressing problems based on gender, peace, and environment.
In 2013 they were able to conduct the My World 2015 Global survey to collect data for drafting of the SDGs, mobilizing youth from all around the country, making sure that every voice been counted! They initiated campaigns to mobilize SDGs through rights based activities in each sector from arts to sports, as we believe Rights can make a bigger impact in fostering SDGs.
In 2016 with the support from their chapters they conducted the biggest youth summit gathering 500 youngsters from all around the world, where they strongly addressed how youth could make an impact through SDGs in their community. In 2017, they brought the SDG Media Zone to Sri Lanka with the support of many youth networks and conducted the biggest festival for SDGs, especially addressing Goal Number 16 stating the importance of Peace and Reconciliation in Sri Lanka.
As a result of that event we were able to launch My Rights My Goals National Campaign to educate young people as well as school children about 2030 agenda and strengthen them on taking actions in their own communities. Implementing Human Rights education and SDGs in to the Tourism Curriculum of University of Colombo was also one of their highlighted results.
The SDG Action Awards draw attention to the need to learn from change-makers from across the globe and celebrate the most impactful and innovative achievements contributing to the global sustainable development movement.
The first edition received over 740 nominations from seven continents and 125 countries, ranging from Zambia to Fiji, from Benin to Norway, from civil society and grassroots initiatives to public sectors and municipal government projects, as well as private sector engagements.
Finalists are being carefully reviewed by 12 prominent figures within the global SDG community.
