Women in IT Forum held

The Federation of Information Technology Industry Sri Lanka (FITIS) launched their Women in IT chapter in July 2017, to promote and encourage diversity in the Industry and to break away from the perception of gender based roles.
As a part of 2017 calendar events, a Women in IT forum was held with a panel discussion named ‘IT for a better society;’ which happened in parallel to INFOTEL 2017, which is the South East Asia’s Premier ICT exhibition by FITIS.
