Healing hearts

The ‘Lyceum Kindness to Hinuggala Children’ CSR programme was held at Hinuggala Junior School, recently. The students and parents of Hinuggala Junior School, a school that falls under the low income region of the Kurunegala district, were all in smiles as the students of Lyceum International School, Kurunegala, visited them. They were happy to receive the basic facilities for their school. Sanitary facilities, stationary, past papers, books and educational support and equipment were given to them under the Lyceum International School, Kurunegala’s CSR project.
The students and management of Lyceum Kurunegala also organised various activities throughout the day. The activities included were a parental education programme for villagers, outbound training for students, singing, dancing and many more performances. The event had been organized under the guidance of the principal of Lyceum International School, Kurunegala, Nikitha Grero.
