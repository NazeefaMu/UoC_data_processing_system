Harin challenges MR over NYT article

UNP Media Spokesman, Telecommunication, Digital Infrastructure and Foreign Employment Minister Harin Fernando yesterday challenged former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to swear through an affidavit that he has never received any financial gratuities from China Harbour Corporation.
Addressing the media at Sirikotha yesterday, Minister Fernando said that the New York Times (NYT) is an American newspaper based in New York City with worldwide influence and readership. Founded in 1851, the paper has won 125 Pulitzer Prizes.
“The New York Times is ranked 17th in the world by circulation. So it never misleads its readers by publishing fake news,” said the Minister.
He further said that an adjournment motion over the article published in the New York Times will be taken up for debate in Parliament.
