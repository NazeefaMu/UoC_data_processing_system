Navy- Havies should be a close game

The high-riding Navy Sports Club will have the edge over Havelock Sports Club in their Dialog ‘A’ Division League rugby tournament return game today at Havelock’s grounds in Havelock Park under lights at 6.30 pm.
Navy lads played a superb game against CR & FC two weeks back at Welisara pulling off a spectacular win by 34 points to 18, hence they will have to come up with a similar performance if they hope to overcome Havies with a bonus point victory as they lost their last match to League winners Kandy SC by 17-41 last week.
Forte of the Navy side have been their power-packed forwards and along with their speedy three quarter line and with players of the calibre of skipper Roshan Ranasinghe, Raveen De silva, captain Danushka “Gertha “ Perera, Dulanjana Wijesinghe, Adeesha Weerathunga, Stefan Greogary, lanky Supun Peiris, Hashan Maduranga, Musheen Falleel, Budhdhima Piyaratne, Tharindu Maduranga, along with their ever green full back Thilina Weerasinghe are likely to give of their best to earn a bonus point win. Meanwhile the hapless Havies outfit lost to CR & FC by 22 points to 30 after a miserable performance last week at Havelock Park. So they have to really improve their playing standard, get their act together and play a good game if they are to beat the formidable Sailors on t heir home ground at Havelock Park.
