Renewable Energy Park in former LTTE stronghold

The one time stronghold of the LTTE in the North is to be turned into a 6,000 hectare Renewable Energy Park generating 240MW of wind and 800MW of solar power.
Cabinet this week granted approval to the proposal made by Minister of Power and Renewable Energy, Ranjith Siyambalapitiya to build a renewable energy park in Pooneryn to be completed by 2030.
The Sustainable Energy Authority in a feasibility study has identified this village in the Kilinochchi District to be the most viable; economically, environmentally and socially to set up a hybrid energy park with both wind and solar power. The Authority will also in the near future declare Pooneryn as a ‘Renewable Energy Development area’ as per the provisions of section 12 of the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority Act.
According to the Cabinet proposal on the project, it is to be set up in three phases; 120MW solar power and 150MW wind power by 2022, further 100MW of wind and 100MW solar by 2025 and the balance by 2030.
The project also proposes to provide around 2000 indirect and direct employment within two years in one of the poorest districts in the country.
The Energy Park proposal however is yet to find an investor and the minister proposes that this would be done through a competitive international bidding process. In addition, the project will also need necessary infrastructure developments in areas such as transmission lines, grid substation control rooms and access roads.
Once built, the park is to be managed by the Sustainable Energy Authority and the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB).
Sri Lanka in 2015, ratified the UN COP 21 Agreement to reduce 20 percent of Green House Gas Emissions by 2030 where 4 percent should be reduced without any condition and 16 percent would be conditional reductions with the assistance of foreign sources. Thus this project declares that it would reduce 1,050,000 MT of Carbon dioxide emissions by the end of it.
Renewable energy has been a strong focus of the government with similar wind and solar plants being built in Mannar, Siyambalanduwa, Chunnakam, Polonnaruwa and Batticaloa.
