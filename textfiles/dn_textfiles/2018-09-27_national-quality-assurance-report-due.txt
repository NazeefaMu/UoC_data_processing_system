Complications following eye injection
National Quality  Assurance report due

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne instructed Health Services Director General Dr. Anil Jasinghe to conduct an investigation into the incident at the Nuwara Eliya Hospital regarding the use of an injection for eye patients, a health ministry spokesman said.
According to the spokesman, complications were reported from 17 eye patients who underwent treatment at the Eye Unit of the hospital after receiving the injection.
Dr. Jasinghe said the injection was handed over to the National Quality Assurance Laboratory for Drugs for investigation.
He had given instructions to authorities to temporarily halt the use of the questionable injection.
The 17 patients who experienced complications are now recovering with medical treatment.
A total of 55 eye patients were treated by the unit on this day. Of them, 17 were re-admitted for medical treatment after developing complications, he said. No similar incidents were reported from other hospitals where the same injection was used on eye patients.
