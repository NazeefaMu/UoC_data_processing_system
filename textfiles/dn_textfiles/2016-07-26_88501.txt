‘Star Trek Beyond’ gracefully finds orbit amid tragedy

When the ‘Star Trek Beyond’ cast and filmmakers gathered in Los Angeles last month for Anton Yelchin’s funeral, they had a decision to make. Their film, the third in the rebooted series, was coming out in less than a month and a rigorous press tour was imminent. They could either put themselves out there to promote the film in the raw and devastating weeks after the death of their beloved co-star, or they could withdraw.
“We came to the conclusion in the end (that) if we withdraw, we’re going to risk not helping a film that should be seen, not least because it stars Anton Yelchin,” said Simon Pegg. “That’s how we found the strength to be here ... It’s hard to talk about, but we don’t want to not talk about it.”
And then, in late February 2015, Leonard Nimoy — the man who originated Mr. Spock — died of end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at age 83. While Quinto had taken over his character officially, Nimoy had appeared in both new films as Spock Prime and the door was left open for his return.
“We knew we were going to make a tribute to Leonard when it happened, but we thought let’s make him part of the DNA of the story too,” Pegg said.
So Pegg and Jung wrote Ambassador Spock’s off-screen death into the film, using it to affect Quinto’s arc, and also serve as an elegy to the actor.
Of course, no one could have foreseen that they would lose another before the film came out, and one of their youngest, in Yelchin who was only 27 when he died after being struck by his own car last month. The close-knit cast and crew of “Star Trek” were also able to say goodbye together at the funeral.
