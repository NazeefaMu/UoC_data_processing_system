Government to construct two fishery harbours at Pt. Pedro, Pesalai

The government had planned to construct two fishery harbours at Point Pedro and Pesalai along with an anchorage at Mandaitivu in Jaffna, under a financial subsidy of USD 158 million provided by the Asian Development Bank. Eight fishery harbours each in the Jaffna and Mannar districts, six fishery harbours in the Mullativu district and three in the Kilinochchi district had been identified as those that require repairs.
Accordingly, the Cabinet of Ministers approved the proposal presented by Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Wijith Wijayamuni Zoysa, to select consulting companies for the project, which would be implemented under three components:
* Construction and development of fishery harbours
* Construction and development of anchorages and ferries
* Development of aquaculture and livelihoods
