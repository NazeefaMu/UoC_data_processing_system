Leopard saved from Gampola estate

A hill country leopard facing death after getting caught in a wire mesh trap laid in a tea plantation in Angurumulla Millagahamula, Gampola was rescued by wildlife officers and veterinarians.
Earlier four leopards died getting caught in similar traps laid in this region. The rescued leopard a female of five feet was taken to the Nuwara Eliya wildlife office.
This particular leopard which had broken away from the trap with part of the wire strapped in the neck struck around tea bushes had been spotted by two tea pluckers who arrived in the morning.
After they alerted the neighbouring residents they had got in touch with an animal lover named Gunaratne who in turn had alerted the Zoologists’ Association of Sri Lanka. Wildlife Minister Gamini Jayawickreme Perera had intervened to dispatch the rescue team to save the life of the leopard.
Leopards straying into the estates very often get caught in wire traps laid by poachers with bicycle and three wheeler cables laid to hunt wild boar and other game.
The rescue Wildlife team was led by OIC Wimalaratne of the Nuwara Eliya Wildlife office together with veterinary surgeons Dr Kamani Dedunupitiya and Dr Yvonne Gunawardena.
