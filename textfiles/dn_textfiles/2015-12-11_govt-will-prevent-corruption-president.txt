Govt. will prevent corruption - President

President Maithripala Sirisena said he would make every arrangement to have the institutions that work towards the prevention of corruption, work in a free and fair manner without any political influence.
He added that the amendments to the Prevention of Corruption Act will be formulated, enabling the Commission to Investigate Allegation of Bribery or Corruption to work freely and independently.
He said the requests by the Commission to Investigate Allegation of Bribery or Corruption will be presented to the Parliament and Cabinet approvals will be taken to implement it.
The president made these remarks at the concluding ceremony of the walk 'A Bribery and Corruption Free Country' at the Independence Square on Wednesday.
The walk was organised by the Transparency International of Sri Lanka and the Commission to Investigate Allegation of Bribery or Corruption, in line with the International Anti-Corruption Day.
The President noted that this is the first instance in which a President of Sri Lanka is participating in an anti-corruption walk.
He pointed out that the former governments did not have the ability to mark this day towards the prevention of corruption.
"Today the people are enjoying the 19th amendment to the constitution brought about by the new government they elected on January 8," he said
action has been taken to free this country from bribery and corruption through this amendment, fulfilling the expectations of the people," the President said.
The Sri Lanka Anti-Corruption Integrity Award was presented posthumously to the Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thero and the former Editor of Ravaya newspaper Victor Ivan.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, Ministers Sagala Rathnayaka and Malik Samarawickrama, Deputy Ministers Harsha de Silva, Karunarathne Paranawithana, Ajith P. Perera, Members of Parliament Sunil Handunnetti, Chairman of the Commission to Investigate Allegation of Bribery or Corruption T. B.
