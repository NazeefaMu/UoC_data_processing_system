Raja Hewabowala re-elected CNCI Chairman
Govt initiatives for FDI will create opportunities

The Ceylon National Chamber of Industries (CNCI) held its 57 Annual General Meeting (AGM) recently in Colombo. Raja Hewabowala, who had been the Chairman CNCI for the past year was re-elected Chairman for another term of one year.
Presenting the Chairman’s Review, Hewabowala said that the post war era with a peaceful atmosphere after a three decades war, the infra-structural development programmes in the country, measures taken by the government to attract Foreign Direct Investors will hopefully create more opportunities in the areas of business both to start and improve. However, the CNCI believes that such opportunities alone do not suffice to make a good businessman without know how and the direction. This is an important era where the chamber involves in filling the gap.

He pointed out that during the period under review, there have also been instances where the Sri Lankan industries have happened to face challenges. Global threats, natural disasters, labour issues, environmental issues, social and political issues coupled with competition have been among a bundle of challenges. The monetary an fiscal policy of the Government also created novel experiences to the local industries amid all these challenges.
He further said that the proposed Free trade Agreement (FTA) between Sri Lanka and China, ETCA with India and the already signed FTA with Singapore were significant factors to be concerned by the industrial sector. The Latest is the Singapore Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement, where the association believed that there were certain adverse implications to the industrial sector. “We submitted the industrial concerns to the Committee appointed by the President,” he said.
Hewabowala added that as the pioneering chamber for industries in the country, their endeavour was to create a level playing field for the local industries which should be free of undue constraints.
