LG bodies member allocation to be completed by next week: Faiszer
The allocation of the number of members in each of the Local Government body will be completed by next week, Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha said in Parliament yesterday.
He was replying to a question by UPFA MP Dullas Alahapperuma as to when the gazette in this regard would be published.
The MP pointed out the Elections Commission is unable to declare the Local Government Elections until the Minister publishes the relevant gazettes and make amendments to the Local Government Elections Act. MP Alahapperuma said the Elections Commission Chairman has highlighted 52 revisions needed to the Act.
The MP made these observations when the minister said holding Local Government elections is on the hands of the Elections Commission.
Minister Musthapha said the Attorney General’s clarification on the incorporation (the allocation of the number of members in each of the Local Government body) of LG bodies was sought by the ministry as there was a new legislation pertaining to facilitating 25 percent female representation in the LG bodies.
He said the AG has given green light to go ahead with the gazette on the incorporation of the LG bodies. He said the amendments pertaining to the LG Election Act would be presented for the Cabinet approval shortly.
It was revealed in the House that the report of the Delimitation Review Committee has not been gazetted. The minister said he handed it over to the Government Printer to be published in the Gazette. However, when MP Alahapperuma said the Gazette has not come out, the minister said he would ask to expedite the process, adding that part of it has been printed.
Minister Musthapha said the Delimitation Review Committee has proposed 1,036 revisions to the boundaries of the wards. He said there are 133 Local Government bodies on which there would be no revision of boundaries.

Road opposite Temple of Tooth Relic won't be opened for vehicles: Kiriella
The road opposite the Temple of the Tooth Relic which is the most venerated place for the Buddhists all over the world will not be opened for the vehicles, Leader of the House and Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said yesterday.
He made this assurance in Parliament in response to a query by Joint Opposition Parliamentary group leader Dinesh Gunawardena under standing order 23(2).
"We have decided to construct a tunnel road from Tennekumbura to Ampitiya and from Bogambara to Gatambe to reduce the traffic congestion in Kandy," Minister Kiriella said. "We got the Cabinet approval today for the construction of the tunnel roads,"he said.
Minister Kiriella said it was hilarious that those who organised car races around the Temple of the Tooth Relic are shedding crocodile tears over the protection of the temple. "It was a UNP government that demarcated the premises where the temple is located as a sacred premises," Minister Kiriella said.
"The UPFA government was in power for 20 years, but they complain that there is traffic congestion in the Kandy city. The previous government only closed the road opposite the Temple of the Tooth Relic. But they did not provide an alternative road for the closed road. But this government has given the solution," he said.
Moving the motion, MP Dinesh Gunawardena said the UPFA government took measures to remove the Court and the Kachcheri which had been constructed within the sacred premises of the Temple of the Tooth Relic by force by the British Colonials. He asked if the government knew that there was an attempt to open the road opposite the temple. "The Chief incumbents of the Malwathu and Asgiriya chapters and Diyawadena Nilame had also requested not to open the road for vehicles," MP Gunawardena said.
He questioned if the government would prevent opening the road for vehicles.
Following the response of Minister Kiriella, MP Gunawardena demanded to make a statement and the Speaker observed that it was a statement.
