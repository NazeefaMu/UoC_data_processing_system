The umpire, DRS and the ICC

The recently concluded Test series between Sri Lanka and England brought to light the imperfection of the Decision Review System (DRS) which has been in use for the past seven years. It is through trial and error that one can rectify and fine tune the system that is in place. So the time has come to make a few changes to the rules governing LBW especially the one dealing with Umpire’s Call.
What the series highlighted was the margin given to umpire’s call which glaringly revealed decisions where the batsmen got away scot free even though the replays showed the ball clearly hitting the stumps. As the present rule stands if it is an umpire’s call it is left to the sole discretion of the onfield umpire to decide on whether to change his decision or not.
In this manner there were several obvious errors to which the naked eye looked plumb out but because of the ball tracking technology and umpire’s call the batsman got away with it.
The consensus of opinion is that the ICC was giving too much to the umpires and the time has come for a change.
Several opinions against the umpire’s call have been expressed that has brought the ICC cricket committee to strongly review the present system and make recommendations to change it.
A strong case in point was the decision given in favour of England wicket-keeper batsman Jonny Bairstow in the Lord’s Test. Sri Lanka opted to challenge umpire S Ravi's on-field call of not out when Shaminda Eranga thudded Bairstow's back pad when he was on 56. The ball-tracking technology (Hawk-Eye) showed the umpire's call standing as the ball missed the 50 per cent mark by a millimeter, as a result of which Bairstow escaped a close shave.
Angelo Mathews and his team were left stunned when the final verdict came from the third umpire. Eventually, Bairstow went on to score a big hundred – 167 not out, which put England in the driving seat.
The Bairstow incident drew strong comments from none other than former Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara who tweeted, “High time the ICC got rid of this umpire's call. If the ball is hitting the stumps it should be out on review, regardless of [the umpire's] decision. With the umpire's call, technology is used as an excuse for the umpire making a mistake. Technology should ensure the correct decision's made.
“If the umpire wants a comfort zone, give him a margin of 20%. If anything more of the ball is hitting it, his decision can be overturned,” Sangakkara added.
Twitter viewers responding to Sangakkara’s comments said, “Sanga is absolutely right, if ball hitting the stumps it should be given out. Suppose if umpire has given out and then England gone for review then it was out because it stays as umpire decision.”
Another tweeted, “This is what exactly Dhoni meant when he said that the Umpire's Call is being used to protect the Umpires and is of no benefit to the game or players!! It's just a mockery and insult to people's intelligence....”
The current DRS rule suggests that 50 per cent of the ball has to hit the stumps for a batsman to be given out LBW. The remaining 50 per cent is jointly allotted to benefit of doubt to the on-field umpire's decision and the lack of foolproof technology, which can accurately track the path of a ball towards the stumps after it hits the batsman.
Sangakkara’s former team mate and captain Mahela Jayawardene, who is now part of the ICC’s cricket committee, revealed that a recommendation has been made to change the DRS rule for LBW.
"We sat in the cricket committee last week and we decided that the 50% rule should be reduced to 25%, so that recommendation will probably go in and it's something for the stakeholders and ICC to take up," Jayawardene told ESPN Cricinfo.
"Even the MCC rule book says if it hits any part of the wicket it should be given out, so you are going away from all that with the 50% rule."
Jayawardene added that it was unfair for teams to lose a review when an lbw decision is so close to be being overturned. Research has shown that up to 80% of umpire's calls that currently remain on-field would be given out under the adjusted procedures.
"That argument has been there for the last three or four years when captains are losing reviews so that is another reason the reduction came into play," he said. "If you take 25% out, I think the stats say that 75-80% of the umpire's calls decisions would be given out. When umpires are considering benefit of the doubt I think 25% is okay, but 50% is too much."
The issue is expected to be discussed at the ICCs annual meeting in Edinburgh later this month. If approved, the DRS rule will be reduced from 50 per cent to 25 per cent and is expected come into effect by the end of September.
