Sri Lanka is a paradise of hospitality: Canadian Tamils

The international image of Sri Lanka should be changed. Sri Lankans are friendly people, Canadian delegates of the Tamil Diaspora said.
A team of Canadian delegates of the Tamil Diaspora visited Ven. Mahanayake Theras and engaged in religious observances at the Temple of the Tooth Relic recently.
Addressing the media, they said the hospitality of the people, including Mahanayaka Theras is amazing.
The delegates said: “Sri Lanka is a beautiful country. The country has different cultures and religions. People are very kind. We also met President Maithripala Sirisena with Minister Faiszer Musthapha. We were treated well. Hospitality in Sri Lanka is outstanding. We are ready to take this message to the world. We invited Ven. Mahanayake Theras to help us change the wrong attitude towards Sri Lanka.”
There were three Canadian representatives in the team of delegates. Yasmin Abdulla Karim Ratansi, a Member of Parliament in Canada along with 25 other members, including other Canadian Members of Parliament Irin Manyasin, Chandrakanth Arya and Parliament representative Arther Shorts were in the team of delegates of the Tamil Diaspora. The team also included investors. They agreed to invest in Sri Lanka.
