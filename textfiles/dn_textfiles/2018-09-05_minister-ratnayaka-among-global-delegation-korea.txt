Minister Ratnayaka among global delegation to Korea

The Korea Foundation stated that Project Management, Youth Affairs and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka will be among the 19 high-level government delegates from around the world visiting South Korea this week.
Korea Foundation President Sihyung Lee told the Korean media that the purpose of the visit is to strengthen Korea’s global image by educating world political leaders on Korean society, its economy and system of governance. “The visit also focuses on people-to-people networking,” Lee told the Korean media.
Honduras Vice President Maria Antonieta is included in the global leaders' delegation.
During the visit, the group will interact with a number of political and business leaders of the East Asian economic giant. The Korean Foundation is affiliated with Korea's Foreign Affairs Ministry and functions as a non-profit public diplomacy organisation working to strengthen Korea’s international organization.
Since its establishment in 1991, the Korean Foundation has hosted many prominent global leaders and it operates seven overseas offices in three continents, including
Beijing, Berlin, Tokyo, Moscow, Washington DC, Los Angeles, and Hanoi.
