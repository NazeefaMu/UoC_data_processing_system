Be man enough to read a woman’s story!

Legal and social restrictions made it difficult for women to easily take on literary careers. Women were not encouraged to become writers until fairly recently, and often did not dare publish under their own names, to protect their families from scandal. Despite rigid gender roles that emphasized a woman’s proper place in the domestic sphere, nineteenth century British women confidently took up the pen to write their own stories. The journey continued and today women are no strangers in the world of literature.
“In Sri Lanka female writers do not appear to have been discriminated against because they are women. But perhaps as in any profession the criticism they face may be gender biased and often irrelevant to their work,” says Ameena Hussein, the only writer from Sri Lanka to be long-listed for her work, “The Moon in The Water” for the first Man Asian Literary Award in 2007. Hussein has proven to be one of the powerful authors who can tell and sell a good story.
Writing process might be some times a challenge and in some places in the world women writers are burdened with societal norms and limits that they cannot easily challenge. Hussein happens to be among the lucky few who have the flair to pen down the formed thoughts or the dreams that happen to pass. Thus she now can call herself a writer.
Has it ever boggled her mind how a woman needs to write or did she meet roadblocks where she either decided not to go any further or decided to deliberately change the course of her process?
“While Sri Lanka is a South Asian country and still retains some of the chauvinism that is rife in the region, of all the countries, it is perhaps the most women friendly. I don’t think I have faced any challenges as a ‘woman’ writer per se and perhaps I am very lucky. I believe that today, most of the people writing in the English language are female writers. In the Sinhala literary field, it looks as if it is the same. Perhaps writing is one arena, where men and women can be judged equally. In the international arena not too long ago, it was believed that men wrote serious stuff and women wrote fluff. I doubt that anyone would direct that charge to Sri Lankan writers. Both men and women tackle difficult subjects and both men and women can write fluff quite well too,” Hussein said.
Strong positive role models
She believes that the portrayal of women in literary works has shifted through the generations. “Today you will find depictions of strong positive role models in literature. But I find that men rarely want to read of a woman protagonist or what may appear to them as a woman’s story. That to me is more troubling than any other. Parents don’t want to buy books that deal with a female heroine for their sons. This conditioning may be what dissuades them from reading women centered books in later life,” Hussein pointed out.
She is the co-founder of Perera Hussein Publishing House in Colombo, which publishes cutting-edge Sri Lankan writing in English. Hussein established the publishing house with her husband Sam Perera after she completed her studies in Los Angeles and returned to Sri Lanka in 2003. The Perera Hussein Publishing House has become the haven and meeting ground for many established and aspiring local writers.
A well-known writer herself, Hussein has published two collections of short stories. Her first book “Fifteen” a collection of short stories, published in 1999 was shortlisted for the Gratiaen award. Zillij, her next book, titled after a traditional Islamic art form of creating intricate designs using hand cut tiles gives the reader a glimpse into a bygone era whilst dealing with perplexing and troubling questions that has spilled over into the present day. It won her the State Literary Prize in 2005.
Limited ambitions
“Being an author was not a profession or a career choice during the time I grew up in Sri Lanka. I had no idea what I wanted to be as a child. We grew up in an age, where parents had limited ambitions for their children. The scope was narrow and restricted to doctor, lawyer, engineer, accountant and so on, none of which had any appeal to me. It was a series of happy events that took me to study in Los Angeles that led me to do a degree in Sociology. Being an author was the farthest thing from my mind,” Hussein says of her start.
“But obviously, that has all changed. Today, there are many parents who say their children want to be authors and many children who will say they want to be authors. I am not sure what motivates them, though. Is it the stupendous success of authors like J.K. Rowling or is it that they think they write really well, or is it because they have stories to tell?” she questions.
For Hussein, inspiration and motivation to write a story can come at anytime and anywhere. “Even the mundane can be inspiring for me. I must not be a very complicated person, because all of life inspires me. It has become a joke among my friends and family that I can travel to the Colpetty market and come back ‘with a story!’ Yet there have been many people who have influenced and inspired me. My parents, my grand-aunt – a strong and formidable matriarch; my bosses, Neelan Tiruchelvam and Radhika Coomaraswamy; my first editor – Regi Siriwardene; and today I am constantly being inspired by people I come across,” Hussein said.
Read. Read. Read. She says to the youth who are interested in writing. “I worked for about ten days at the Colombo Book Fair, and saw too many parents and children shopping for text books exclusively. Fiction or nonfiction that is not related to their studies is considered a waste of time. Perhaps that accounts for their dismal vocabulary, spelling and speech. Reading gives you that edge, where you learn new words, see how sentences are constructed, imbibe spelling, and enjoy the time spent learning. It is effortless,” she said.
Family life and work
Hussein sees just a little separation between family life and work. “I happen to work with my husband and partner in business Sam Perera and so we have the opportunity to talk shop at any given moment. Many times a benefit though sometimes it is a hindrance. But on the whole, since I work for myself it is all about having a balance. Sometimes one wins and sometimes the other. It’s like any other life, I suppose,” she says.
“The publishing house Perera Hussein has just entered the non-fiction arena from this year, and I am enjoying it hugely. For many years, we felt that fiction was our forte, but this expansion has given the publishing house an added dimension we didn’t have earlier. As for me, I too am involved in a non-fiction project that will hopefully result in a book on Ibn Battuta the fourteenth century traveler. I don’t like to plan too many projects at the same time, I like the year to bring me strange and interesting things that I would like to get involved in.
As expected the publishing house will have its usual quota of manuscripts that I will have to edit and make ready for publication for the coming years. My plan for next year is to devote equal time to my own work as well as my assigned work. Hopefully, fingers crossed, my new book will come out soon,” Hussein said of her future plans giving hope for readers to await another exciting book on the shelf.
