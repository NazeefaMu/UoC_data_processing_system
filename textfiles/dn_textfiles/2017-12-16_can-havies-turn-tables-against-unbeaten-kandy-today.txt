Can Havies turn tables against unbeaten Kandy today?

Can Havelock Sports Club turn tables against unbeaten Kandy Sports Club in their Dialog ‘A’ division inter-club league rugby tournament first round
final match at Havelock Park at 6.30 pm under lights today will be the question among the local rugby fraternity.
Havelock SC will miss the services of their experienced national skipper cum granite hard number eight Sudarshana Muthuthantttri due to him being
overseas, while Sri Lanka national sevens star Kevin Dixon will not return to the side for this all important encounter after sustaining a serious jaw injury.
Burly forward Liston Flatney will start as one of the prop forwards for today’s game alongside last year’s skipper Dushmantha Priyadarshana, pushing Lasindu Ishan karunathilake to play in his pet position as number eight.
The Kandy ‘eight’ led by national player cum number eight Buwaneka Udangamuwa will have the services of Shehan Pathirana, Soyuru Anthony,
Jason Dissanayake, Ganuka Dissanayake and Ashan Darling to give a terrific display in the loose.
Havelock’s have been hard at practices under the leadership of their captain and second row forward Jason Melder this week and they are aiming for a morale-boosting win in their home grounds at Havelock Park.
Mean while Kandy SC cannot afford to have any mistakes in this game and will have to play really well to topple the Havies side since Havelock’s are playing in their home grounds in Havelock Park.
Even if Havelock’s win this game, Kandy will go through to head the league championship points table due to the luxury of total bonus extra points and total number of tries that they are presently enjoying over Havies.
Going by the two teams performances Kandy are definite favourites to pull this game through but in all probability it can turn out to be a closely fought out affair if Havies give a good fight to the hill capital boys.
Kandy SC (Probable XV) Ganuka Dissanayake, Uchitha Jayasuriya, Ashan darling, Shehan Dimitri, Soyuru Anthony, Jason Dissanayake, Shehan Pathirana, Buwaneka Udangamuwa, Roshan Weeraratne and Fazil Marija, Richard Darmapala, Gayan Weeraratne(Captain), Danushka Ranjan, Anurudda Willwara, Nigel Ratwatte or Thilina Wijesinghe
