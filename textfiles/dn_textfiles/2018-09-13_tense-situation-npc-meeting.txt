Tense situation at NPC meeting

A tense situation prevailed at yesterday’s Northern Provincial Council (NPC) session when Chief Minister C.V. Vigneswaran entered the council premises. A group of Provincial Councilors started questioning the Chief Minister about the provincial Ministers.
They asked the Chief Minister as to how six provincial ministers were appointed to the council in contravention of the Provincial Councils Act. Wigneswaran said that he would disclose the names of provincial ministers at the next council session.
