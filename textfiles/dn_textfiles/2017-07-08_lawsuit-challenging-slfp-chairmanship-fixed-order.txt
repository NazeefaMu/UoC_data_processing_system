Lawsuit challenging SLFP Chairmanship fixed for order

The Colombo District Court yesterday set August 3 to deliver its order regarding the preliminary objections raised against a lawsuit that sought an order to re-instate former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the chairman of the party once again.
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) General Secretary through his counsel had raised objections citing that there is no legal basis to proceed with the case.
This lawsuit had been filed by two plaintiffs K.D.Aruna Priyashantha and Asanka Nandana Srinath citing the SLFP General Secretary and the Elections Commission Chairman as defendants.
The plaintiffs alleged that the former SLFP General Secretary Anura Priyadarshana Yapa had sent a letter to the EC in January 2015 over the appointment of a new SLFP Chairman.
They plaintiffs further alleged that the executive committer of the party without holding a proper committee meeting, had taken the decision to make new appointments to the SLFP leadership.
