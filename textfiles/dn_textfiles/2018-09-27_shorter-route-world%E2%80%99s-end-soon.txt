Shorter route  to World’s End soon

A shorter access road to World’s End escarpment in Horton Plains will soon be opened to the public, Sabaragamuwa Province Governor Niluka Ekanayake said, during an observation tour of the present access road to Horton Plains recently.
The World’s End escarpment situated in Horton Plains National Park in Nuwara Eliya, located at 4,000 feet, is a major attraction among local and foreign tourists. Today, it takes almost three hours for tourists to reach it by travelling through Ohiya, she said.
Recently, a private television station announced the availability of a much shorter route to this attraction from Balangoda via Nonpareil Estate, which is only about two-and-a-half kilometres in length.
A team led by Governor Ekanayake conducted an observation tour of the proposed route.
This route established during the period of British planters is still usable . However, the management of Nonpareil Estate had blocked it by erecting a gate at the estate side entrance.
Governor Ekanayake asked the estate authorities to dismantle the gate before the group on the observation tour. She said she would take steps to legalise this shorter route to help boost tourism.
