Mahogany Masterpieces opens new showroom

Mahogany Masterpieces expands its presence with the opening of its new store at Dickmans Road Colombo 5.
Adding to its expansive range that hallmarks a diverse collection from the contemporary to the classical, the avant garde to the traditional, Mahogany Masterpieces also presents an entire portfolio of new designs and new ?nishes including its latest piano ?nish, pantry units and built in closets in solid luxury timber including teak and a wide range of accessories and ?ne art at this new showroom.
Mahogany Masterpieces has also just launched its new app which details its entire product catalogue, new designs, latest promotions, services, care tips and order follow ups compatible with all iOS and Android devices, available on iTunes or Playstore.
While customers will have technology at their ?ngertips to be better informed, purchasing furniture is now much more experiential. The new showroom has convenient parking and is centrally located, while the app takes customers into virtual reality.
Explains Managing Partner Kishan Gooneratne, “Selecting furniture for a home or o?ce is a personal experience and sometimes, it is quite challenging to visualise how a piece would look in the actual setting,” he says. “Our app now enables a customer to select a product from the catalogue, via its augmented reality function, place it in the desired space and make an informed decision after seeing how it looks.”
There are some fundamental values that Mahogany Masterpieces has always abided by and become key to its continued brand recall and customer loyalty. Says Kishan: “Each of our pieces are created, crafted and ?nished to perfection. But that’s not all that sets us apart.
Priding themselves on crafting spaces that prompt lifestyle transformations, Kishan states whether its living, dining, bedroom, pantries or accessories for homes, corporates, hotels, restaurants or any interior solutions, Mahogany Masterpieces ensures that the triad of quality, craftsmanship and unique design makes each space a customised setting.
The genesis of Mahogany Masterpieces began with a uniquely crafted button made for an iconic Sri Lankan fashion brand. It was the success of this ?rst order that prompted Sumith Gooneratne to found Craft Supplies in 1974, eventually launching their lifestyle brand Mahogany Masterpieces.
The legacy of quality, creativity and perfection had already paved the way for the new chapter and now,43 years later, Mahogany Masterpieces etches a further chapter with its new showroom and technologically advanced user-friendly app.
