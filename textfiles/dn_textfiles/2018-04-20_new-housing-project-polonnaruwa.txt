New housing project for Polonnaruwa

Foreign Affairs State Minister Wasantha Senanayake on Wednesday (18) laid the foundation stone for a housing project which will establish 18 model villages in the Polonnaruwa electorate. Each village will have 24 houses.
Concurrently, the State Minister also started a livelihood programme for the villagers with the provision of TJC mango plants. The houses were built on the request made by the State Minister to Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa. Each house was allocated Rs. 500,000 as housing aid and loans.
The farmer families for the project were chosen by the Housing Development Authority.
