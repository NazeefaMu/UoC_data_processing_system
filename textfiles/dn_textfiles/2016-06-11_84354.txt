We cannot condone efforts to create problems to Army - Prime Minister

Efforts taken by some interested parties to create problems between the Army and the people living in close proximity to the Salawa Army Camp where ammunition caught fire destroying the whole camp recently could not be approved, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament yesterday.
The Premier made this observation in response to Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake who made a special statement under Standing Order 23(2) stating that delays in providing relief to the affected had led to protests along the Colombo - Awissawella Road.
“We cannot condone such efforts to create problems to the Army,” Premier Wickremesinghe said. “We are providing all the relief possible to the affected people.”
The Premier further said it would take at least 60 days to reconstruct those houses that were destroyed by the fire. He said compensation would also be provided to those whose houses have been partly damaged and not usable. He added that however until the security forces give their approval assuring the security, nobody would be able to reach certain areas.
“There could be blasts in such areas and it is the duty of the security forces to give us an assurance that the area is safe,” the Premier said.
He further said that nearly 125 contaminated wells in the area have been cleaned up as of yesterday and the rest would be cleaned up soon. “ Water Supply Minister Rauf Hakkem pledged to provide 10,000 mineral bottles of water,” the Premier said. “But the Divisional Secretary needed water bowsers and they have been duly deployed to provide drinking water."
The Premier also said the survey to assess the damages caused by the fire was in progress.
MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake said the government should have gone into action immediately to provide relief and assess the damages. He said that people have faced serious issues with drinking water. He also added that the people who were settled in partially damaged houses had no means to prepare their meals. “At least there is no procedure formulated to asses the damages caused to their property,” MP Dissanayake said. “People would not have got on to the streets if there were no issues.”
