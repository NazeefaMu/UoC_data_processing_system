Romelu Lukaku chant is 'racist'

Anti-discrimination group Kick It Out has contacted Manchester United to ask them to stop the club's fans singing a "racist" chant about Romelu Lukaku.
It says the lyrics, about the size of the Belgium striker's penis, are "offensive and discriminatory".
"Racist stereotypes are never acceptable, irrespective of any intention to show support for a player," said Kick It Out.
A United blog has already asked the club's fans to refrain from the song. "It's a cheap and insulting stereotype that has no place in this day and age," United fan Scott Patterson wrote in a post on The Republik of Mancunia. BBC
