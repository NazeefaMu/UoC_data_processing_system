‘SLPP only contesting party without a  picture of its leader’

Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Mahinda Amaraweera, addressing an election rally at Agunakolapelessa, said that the Podujana Peramuna Party that is contesting the forthcoming local government elections is the only political party without a picture of its leader. Instead of the picture of the leader of the party, they are using the picture of Kurunegala District MP, Mahinda Rajapaksa.
The minister said that Minister Sajith Premadasa had disbursed housing loans to about 3,000 people this year. He asked what the JVP and the pohottuwa party can promise the people. “Politicians will not rob the public resources or engage in corruption because they know the regime headed by President Maithripala Sirisena will order relevant authorities to bring them to book and bring them before courts of law. President Sirisena will be tough towards corrupt politicians,” he said.
