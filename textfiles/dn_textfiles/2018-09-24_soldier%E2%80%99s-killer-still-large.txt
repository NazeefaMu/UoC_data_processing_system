Soldier’s killer  still at large

The suspected killer of a soldier attached to the Ambepussa Sinha Regiment camp remains at large with the Police still unable to identify a possible suspect.
The soldier was found stabbed to death with a sharp object at his guard post at around 4.40 am on Friday.
Speaking to the Daily News, OIC of the Mirigama Police, Chief Inspector Chinthaka Peiris said they had not received any lead to the possible suspect.
“We are currently recording statements from soldiers within the camp,” he said.
 
 However, inside sources were able to reveal that the soldier’s duty weapon had gone missing during the incident and that it was the second weapon to go missing from the camp in recent times. Several months ago, a weapon at the camp’s armoury was found to have disappeared without explanation.
According to camp sources, the perpetrator is believed to have arrived on a motorbike from outside the camp before committing the act. The use of Police sniffer dogs along the suspected route used by the killer had not provided any results as yet.
Meanwhile, the Sri Lanka Army has commenced their own inquiry into the killing, Military Spokesman Brigadier Sumith Atapattu said.
“The Military Police will conduct their own inquiry apart from Police investigations,” he said, adding that a course of inquiry as required by government institutions in similar circumstances will also be conducted. The deceased soldier was identified as 21-year-old W.M.N.S. Jayasena, a resident of Bulathkohupitiya, Kegalle.
Camp sources say the soldier was on duty at the post between 2.00 am - 4.00 am before being discovered dead in the guard room at around 4.40 am on the day.
