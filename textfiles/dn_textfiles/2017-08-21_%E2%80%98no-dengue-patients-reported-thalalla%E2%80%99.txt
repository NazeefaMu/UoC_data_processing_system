‘No dengue patients reported from Thalalla’

“No dengue patients were reported from the Thalalla area when thousands dengue patients were reported from other areas in the country,” Thalalla Public Health Inspector Indika Gunawardena said.
He was participating a beach clean up campaign at the Thalalla beach last Saturday morning (19) along with tourists and hotel employees.
The campaign was initiated by stakeholders in the tourist industry in Devinuwara.
“94 dengue cases were reported in the Devinuwara PS area during the last six months but Thalalla had not reported any. 20 were recorded from the Kandegodella. I appreciate the initiative taken by the hotel staff and foreign nationals to clean up mosquito breeding grounds in my area,” he said.
Convener of the beach cleanup campaign Lal Jayadewa said tourists arrivals were considerably reduced after the outbreak of dengue. "We should ensure that our area is free of dengue and other
diseases or tourists would not arrive in the region anymore,” he said.
A tourist hotel GM Chathura Gajasinghe said many tourists had cancelled their bookings at tourist hotels due to dengue outbreak in the country.
Australian tourist Helen Langston said she joined the campaign seeing the dismal sight of the once beautiful Thalalla beach.
“I visit Thalalla regularly and the beach was spotless when I first visited the area. It is sad that the Sri Lankans do not value their beaches. Authorities should place litter bins at places frequented by the public,” she said.
Devinuwara Pradesheeya Sabha Secretary S. W. A. Karunasiri and many others participated.
