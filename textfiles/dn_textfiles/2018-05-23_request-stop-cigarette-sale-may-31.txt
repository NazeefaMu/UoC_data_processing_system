Request to stop cigarette sale on May 31

National Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol (NATA) Chairman Dr. Palitha Abeykoon requests all Sri Lankans to refrain from selling and using tobacco on May 31.
Addressing a press conference held at the Government Information Department Auditorium yesterday, he said the World No Tobacco Day falls on May 31 every year and this year, all Sri Lankans are being requested to refrain from selling cigarettes and smoking cigarettes on this day.
Cabinet approval has been received to ban selling cigarettes within a 100-metre radius of a school and introduce plain packaging with the pictorial warning. Cabinet approval will be received within the next few weeks to ban the sale of single cigarettes, he said.
At present, only 10 or 12 percent of the population smoke in Sri Lanka and if the country can reduce this percentage to below 10 percent, it would not be a public health issue any longer. Then it would be a significant achievement for the country, he added.
