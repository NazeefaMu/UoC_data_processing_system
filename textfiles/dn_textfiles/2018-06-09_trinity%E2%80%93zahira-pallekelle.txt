KANDY SPORTS ROUND UP:
Trinity–Zahira at Pallekelle

Trinity who are brimming with confidence after their win last week go out firm favorites when they clash with Zahira College in their inter school Cup competition rugby encounter at Pallekelle. It was evident at the last outing that the Trinitarians have a powerful set of forwards and their quarters moved gallantly and their forte is to attack from the moment they are on the move. Zahirians who did well in the first half of their last game failed to do so in the second half, this was due to the entire team observing Ramadan fast. They too have plenty of talent and experience behind them. Trinitians are placed 6th in the table and Zahirians are 8th. The game will kick off at 3.30 p.m, because Zahira College players who are fasting have to break fast at 6.25 p.m.
Blaze trophy - Kingswood in Colombo to play Wesley
Kingswood College will play Wesley College in their 2nd round Cup game at Race course in Colombo for the L.E. Blaze trophy. Both sides are brimming with confidence and should present a good game of rugby. They have a powerful set of forwards and their three quarters move gallantly and their forte is to attack from the moment they are on the move. The better side of the day should come out as winners.

Change of rugby coach for Trinity
Trinity College unfortunately failed to live up to its reputation and Fijian coach Lote Raikabula cannot be found fault alone, the players and atmosphere around also has a part to play. The new interim coach Inthie Marikar is no newcomer to rugby, he learnt his rugby at this school. He started his first day on Monday, but it all depends on how best he will be able to perform, a coach can teach rugby but it is up to the players to do well. Today if a team loses the blames goes to the coach, not to the players who failed to do well.

In 1995 they finished runners-up in the Sara Trophy limited over tournament. They also had a brief ‘marriage’ with rugby due to the efforts of Malcolm Perera, H. Marikar and Bodi Liyanage. But after two seasons they had to give up due to financial constraints.
