Airtel helps to find last location of missing persons

Bharti Airtel, a leading global telecommunications company with operations in 17 countries across Asia and Africa, pioneered to assist those who are affected by the recent floods. Anyone can locate a missing Airtel customer through the number 0752443443 to find the last location of their loved ones during the disaster.
As at June 1, 96 people were still missing after the torrential rains wreaked havoc across fifteen districts. Airtel rose with their trusted telecommunication facilities to help the affected community to recover from this adverse situation.
The facility aids location of the missing ones via a SMS sent to Airtel. Airtel requests to SMS, the AIRTEL NUMBER (space) NAME of the missing person to 0752443443 and Airtel will revert to the customer with the last location of the missing person. Based on the location which the specific number was last used, the location is notified to the requester and the missing person will also be notified via SMS.
Airtel has further initiated a free of charge safety alerts system to inform safe and risk-prone locations to its customers.
Acknowledging the vitality of being connected during an emergency, Airtel managed to restore all the affected towers within days. Airtel is dedicated to providing uninterrupted service to its customers by keeping all their networks functioning while providing free calls and SMSs. The company gave higher recharge loans for Airtel users in the disaster areas to stay connected with the loved ones during the nation's disaster situation.
Apart from the technological support given, Airtel employees volunteered to hand over much needed recovery items for the disaster victims impacting over 5,000 members across Kalawana, Molkawa, Thalawama and Agalawatte.
“Airtel network was the only network which was connected during the three days of the heavy rain,” said Pavithra NisansalaWimalasooriya, Assistant Divisional Secretary, Kalawana, Ratnapura District.
