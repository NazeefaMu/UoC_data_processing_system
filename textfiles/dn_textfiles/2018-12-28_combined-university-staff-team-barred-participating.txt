States Services TT in Jaffna
Combined University Staff team barred from participating

Combined University staff team was inconvenienced when their entry was rejected at the last moment at the States Services table tennis championship worked off at Jaffna Central College yesterday.
The organizers did not allow Combined University to participate saying that they were not eligible to participate according to the rules.
Combined University staff team captain Anoma Ratnayake told the Daily News: “We applied to participate in this tournament a couple of months before, and our application was accepted by the organizers. But at last minute they rejected it after we had reached Jaffna for the tournament. If they had any issues of us participating they could have informed us earlier.”
The organizers stated that the University staff team does not come under State Services category but the question remained unanswered why they had accepted their application if it was so.
“I requested the organizers to the allow us to compete and said that we don’t need any trophies or anything but the for betterment of sports, but they rejected our request,” Anoma said.
The Combined University staff team won the ‘C’ category title of the State Services championship held in Anuradhapura last year. Thus it is strange that they were not allowed to participate this year.
