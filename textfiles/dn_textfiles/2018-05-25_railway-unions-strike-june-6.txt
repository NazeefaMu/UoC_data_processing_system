Railway unions to strike from June 6

Railway trade unions are preparing to engage in strike action from June 6 midnight, based on several demands.
A spokesman from the Railway Trade Unions Alliance (RTUA) said the strike will be launched demanding authorities to provide solutions for six matters including the withdrawal of a proposal made by the Cabinet subcommittee headed by Minister Sarath Amunugama to set up a Railway Administrative Board.
“We are also against the proposal of structuring the Railway Department when the service improves,” he said. He said the issues related to the employee recruitment process should be resolved in a fixed timeframe.
