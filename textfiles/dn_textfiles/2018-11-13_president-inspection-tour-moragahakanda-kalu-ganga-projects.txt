President on inspection tour of Moragahakanda, Kalu Ganga projects

President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday conducted an inspection tour of the Moragahakanda, Kalu Ganga Irrigation development projects and was told by Mahaweli officials that the dam was filling up at a satisfactory level.
The filling of the reservoir began in July of this year and with the rains, they expect it to be full by January. The completion of this dam will help farmers even during the drought season to continue with their irrigation activities.
The President, who held a meeting with officials after the inspection tour, discussed the progress of the inland fisheries industry, power generation, tourism, and other additional industries created as a result of the Morgahakanda-Kalu Ganga Irrigation Development project.
In addition, the development works in the new Laggala town, Sri Lanka first organic agriculture park and special zonal agricultural projects were discussed.
The President paid attention to the release of lands in the Mahaweli zones and asked that officials complete the processes soon. The President thereafter visited the Gem and Jewellery Authority on an inspection tour and later visited the reception area of the Presidential Secretariat to inspect whether visitors to the Secretariat had adequate facilities.
