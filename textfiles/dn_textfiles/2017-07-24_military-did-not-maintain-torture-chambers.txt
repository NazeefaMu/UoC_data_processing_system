Military did not maintain torture chambers

Defence State Minister Ruwan Wijewardene yesterday strongly refuted claims made by United Nations Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and Counter-terrorism Ben Emmerson that the military was maintaining torture-chambers.
Wijewardene said the government does not agree with the alleged comments made by Ben Emmerson with regards to the above subject, following his visit to Sri Lanka with several other UN Rapporteurs. Wijewardene vehemently refuted that Sri Lanka military was keeping torture-chambers at present and added that the government has a zero-tolerance policy on torture.
Wijewardene made these observations at a media brief held at the UNP head quarters Sirikotha yesterday morning. The Defence Minister also said the government has “nothing to hide” from international human rights organisations of the present operation of the military forces in the country.
“Any human rights organisation can come to investigate to see if such torture-chambers are available,” he added.
Minister Wijewardene said it is very clear that international human rights organisations are ‘fed’ with ‘false facts’ by certain groups of Diaspora in order to continue their status as ‘refugees of war’ and subsequently to raise funds.
He also said the Yahapalana government has has assured all Sri Lankans of their human rights.
Minister Wijewardene pointed out the government will not allow an inclusion of foreign judges to the examinations done on war crimes in Sri Lanka.
“If they desire, they can observe the proceedings but not to examine,” he said.
