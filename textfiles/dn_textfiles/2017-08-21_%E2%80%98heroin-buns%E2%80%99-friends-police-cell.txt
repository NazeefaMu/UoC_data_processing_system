‘Heroin buns’ for friends in police cell

A man who brought 'heroin' hidden inside buns into a Police station meant for his drug addict friends in custody, was arrested in Kadugannawa yesterday.
Earlier in the day Kadugannawa police had arrested four men who are believed to be drug addicts after they found heroin in their possession.
The four suspects had been kept in a Police cell to be produced in courts the next day.
Another person said to be a friend of the arrested had visited them later at the Police station with buns and tea.
The Police officer on duty at the cell had felt suspicious about the person's behaviour and had checked the buns he was carrying for his friends.
Upon finding several packets of heroin hidden inside the buns the man who brought them had to join his friends inside the cell.
