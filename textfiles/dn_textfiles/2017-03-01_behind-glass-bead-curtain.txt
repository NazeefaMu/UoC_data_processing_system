Behind the glass bead curtain

An internationally favoured writer in English, Dr Lakshmi Kannan’s, latest work recounts in fictional terms the realities in the lives of a few characters in British India in a very interesting way marked by a flow of English writing that is remarkable. You would enjoy the carefully used selective words and phrases the writer employs which are effective in bringing out the nuances in detail as one notices in French writing even in translation. I am not exaggerating. University students in English Departments will find it a valuable tool for their dissection and thesis content writing.
The novel is not only successful in structure but also rich meat in substance as a window to show about many things in Brahman families then with their practices, conventions, rituals, child marriages and the like the in neighboring India.
It is better for me and you to tell the theme and plot of the story clearly if I give what the blurb of the book published by Vitasta Publishing Pvt Ltd, 2/15, Ansari Road, Daryaganj, New Delhi, 110 002 in 2016 priced at Indian 299 Rupees:
“Kalyani and Athai. Two feisty women, sail through the turn-of-the century Madras Presidency under British rule, despite archaic and tyrannical customs such as child marriage and gender bias.
Kalyani’s child marriage ends her formal education because of a prevalent superstition that married girls would be widowed if sent to school. Tutored at home by the intrepid Susan O’Leary of Irish origin. Kalyani joyfully oaks in Shakespeare and Bacon along with O’Leary’s humour.
Packed off to her husband’s home at the onset of puberty, she faces the taunts of her retrograde females-in-law as she has grown taller than her husband Natarajan.
Kalyani battles her way through funny situations to evolve as a successful badminton coach with the support of her husband, father-in-law and grand mother-in-law.
Ambujam, her mother-in-law mocks her English and English education but is forced to seek Kalyani’s help for her daughter Karpagam, rejected by her husband for not knowing English.
Athai, a child widow, is fired by a relentless quest for education. She emerges as an intellectual who is far ahead of her times in addressing women’s issues. Her family discovers an astonishing secret about her when she dies.”
As you would see, Lakshmi Kannan, the novelist unobtrusively in a sense, one of the pioneer feminist writers in India. She is bilingual- Thamil and English. Her first novel was in her mother tongue. The English title of the book reads Going Home. That too dealt with social issues. The novel under review- The Glass Bead Curtain-, is in English. She translates her works by herself.
We learn that ” she has published extensively her critical essays on gender issues, language issues, on the art of translation and the afterlife of a translated work… he has presented papers in various national and international forums including the International Feminist Book Fairs in Canada and the Netherlands.”
Dr Lakshmi Kannan is a scholar in English. Humble and modest. I have met her on two occasions in New Delhi, where she lives.
“She has received Resident Fellowships from international writing Program at the University of Iowa (USA); Charles Wallace Trust with the University of Kent at Canterbury (UK); the Indian Institute of Advanced Study, Shimla and Sahitya Akademi, Delhi and was a British Council Visitor to the University of Cambridge (UK).
Raving reviews of her chiseled writing in English has already appeared in Indian and foreign journals.
I enjoyed reading this novel for the implicit social comment and meticulously constructed structure of the novel and the beautiful and effective language used. This is evident in several passages in the novel. There is a superb description of how badminton should be played as explained by the main character Kalyani.
The humour and sarcasm come out nicely. The story is narrated by a writer named Shailaja. Interesting observations of writers and writing are recorded where sarcasm is conveyed subtly.
To demonstrate an example of the writer’s style of writing here is a short passage at the opening of the novel:
“She attended some of the book launches dressed in her casual best and made the usual polite noises. Or she stood back and watched the typical drama unfolding – a swanky event in a big hotel, the evening- dotted with stylish, high profile people, a celebrity to release the book, followed by the wines and the multi-cuisine dinner, after which, at times, one heard nothing more about the book… Many of the books launched with so much fanfare sank without a trace. But who cared? (Pages 2 & 3)”
The narrator Shailaja calls her enclosure at home where she spends most of the time writing – The Glass Bead Curtain. “Shailaja wrote on the top of the sheet, THE GLASS BEAD CURTAIN, all in upper case. Two lines below, she wrote Chapter One, What God Left Out.
She wrote on till midnight. She just could not stem the flow of her writing” concludes Lakshmi Kannan.
It is worth to be put in your library to relish from time to time.
