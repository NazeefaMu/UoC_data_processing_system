Kremlin Guard of honour for President

President Maithripala Sirisena was received with a Guard of Honour at the Kremlin’s Alexender Garden when he visited the Red Square to place a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. It was a touching moment for the President - a son of a soldier who served in the 2nd World War- when he placed the wreath at the war memorial dedicated to the soldiers killed during the WWII.
The Military Commandant of Moscow received the President at the magnificent War Memorial and the President inspected the Guard of Honour before placing the wreath.
The Russian Military Band played the national anthems of two countries while President and the delegation stood at attention. President Sirisena was scheduled to meet President Putin, Prime Minister Dimitri Medvedev and other leaders in Kremlin. He will also attend the ceremony to mark 60th Anniversary of establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.
Jayanthi Sirisena, Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera, Science and Technology Research Minister, Susil Premajayantha, Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Minister, John Amaratunga, Skills Development and Vocational Training Minister Mahinda Samarasimghe, Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development and Cultural Affairs Minister S B Navinna, Minister of Sports, Dayasir Jayasekera and Deputy Minister of Tourism Arundika Fernando were also present.
