Inland Revenue Union workers launch token strike against Inland Revenue draft bill

 
The Inland Revenue Joint Trade Union Joint Committee launched a token strike today against what they termed the Inland Revenue draft bill proposed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
Trade Union Joint Committee Co-Secretary H.A.L. Udayasiri said that the protest is against the intention to obtain revenue from religious organizations, welfare societies and death donation societies by the proposed draft bill.
Trade Union Joint Committee General Secretary Ajith Pushpakumara alleged the government to have not held any discussions regarding the decision with the Trade Union.
