UNP, SLFP to decide on PC  polls system

The SLFP and UNP will discuss whether to hold the next Provincial Council election on the old PR system or the new electoral system.
Co-cabinet Spokesman, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said all political parties except the SLFP have agreed to hold the upcoming Provincial Council election according to the old system. However, they have all agreed to go for a new mixed system after that election. But, we all uphold the mixed system as a matter of principal,” he said at the weekly Cabinet press briefing held yesterday.
President Maithripala Sirisena has also advised both parties to reach a conclusion regarding this matter after discussions. The five-member Committee rectifying anomalies in the Delimitation report has asked for another two months to complete its work. Therefore, we expect to hold the Provincial Council election before the next Sinhala and Tamil New Year after these conclusions,” he added.
Lands and Parliamentary Reforms Minister Gayantha Karunathilake said all political parties will be convened to discuss this matter.
