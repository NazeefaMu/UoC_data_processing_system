Parliament convened for special session on Jan.10

 
A special sitting of Parliament has been convened tomorrow at 10.30 am to discuss the bond report following the request of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Acting Secretary-General of Parliament Neil Iddawala issuing a press release today said all Parliamentarians have been informed to attend the special sitting.
Speaking to the Daily News Iddawala added a Party Leaders Meeting chaired by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya has been scheduled at 2pm tomorrow to discuss the agenda for January 10.
He said most probably the Prime Minister would make a statement at the commencement of the sittings.
The report of Presidential Commission of Inquiry on the Bond issue is likely to be tabled on the same day.
The Prime Minister addressing the UNP Convention rally at Campbell Park on Sunday stated that he had formerly requested Speaker Jayasuriya to convene Parliament ahead of schedule to discuss the Commission report.
The first sitting of Parliament for 2018 was earlier scheduled on January 23.
