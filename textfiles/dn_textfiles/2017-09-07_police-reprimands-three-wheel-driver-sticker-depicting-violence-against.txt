Police reprimands three-wheel driver with sticker depicting violence against women

 
Police have taken steps to warn a three-wheel driver who had a sticker depicting violence against women on the back of his three-wheeler to refrain from inciting violence against women in that manner.
Police had educated the three-wheel driver, a resident of Haldamulla, on the graver consequences of the sticker - that depicted a man kicking a woman - and also of the laws protecting women in society.
Police said they would not hesitate to implement the law against perpetrators of crimes against women, and the driver was let go only after he had removed the offensive sticker from his vehicle.
Police had also questioned the three-wheel driver at length to find out where he had procured the sticker in order to ensure no other stickers of that nature were being sold anywhere else in Sri Lanka.
Police said they were acting on a complaint directed by Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayaka and said they would continue to monitor the situation to ensure there was no casual discrimination against women.
