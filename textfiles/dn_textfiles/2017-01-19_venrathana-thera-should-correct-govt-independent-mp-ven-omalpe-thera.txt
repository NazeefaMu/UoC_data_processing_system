Ven.Rathana Thera should correct govt. as an independent MP: Ven. Omalpe Thera

 The move to act independently will be more purposeful lest Ven.Athuraliye Rathana Thera could give up his MP position, Ven.Omalpe Sobhitha Thera said.
Ven.Sobhitha Thera was speaking at a media brief on Ven.Athuraliye Rathana Thera’s decision to stand as an independent MP in Parliament.
Ven.Sobhitha Thera said Ven.Rathana Thera’s decision to correct the present government while standing as an independent MP is well received.
“It is only after holding an independent stance, that one will be able to look at something from all dimensions,” Ven.Sobhitha Thera said.
“However,this decision will be more productive if Ven. Rathana Thera is not attached to a political party or an organisation,” the Thera said.
“If Ven.Rathana Thera could resign from his MP position, it will give more meaning to his decision to become independent,” Ven. Sobhitha Thera further said.
