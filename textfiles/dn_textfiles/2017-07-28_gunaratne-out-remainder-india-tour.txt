Gunaratne out for remainder of India tour

Sri Lanka Cricket yesterday confirmed that Asela Gunaratne has been ruled out of the ongoing Test series and for the rest of the tour by India after fracturing his left thumb on the first day of the first cricket Test currently being played at Galle. Gunaratne sustained an intra articular comminuted fracture to his left thumb while fielding and underwent reconstructive surgery in Colombo on Wednesday evening.
Medical experts have indicated that Gunaratne will be out of action for a minimum of 6-8 weeks, and will be able to return to full mobility under a strictly managed rehabilitation regime over the period.
Gunaratne played a crucial role in Sri Lanka’s four-wicket win in the one-off Test against Zimbabwe last week scoring an unbeaten 80. In his absence Sri Lanka are down to ten batsmen for the Galle Test.
