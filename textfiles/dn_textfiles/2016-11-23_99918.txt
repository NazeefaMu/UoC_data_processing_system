‘Feeling young’ Pacquiao eager for Mayweather

WBO welterweight world champion Manny Pacquiao said Tuesday he felt like a young man in his twenties and would relish another crack at Floyd Mayweather.
The Filipino icon, 37, made a winning comeback from his brief retirement earlier this month and said he was in great shape to try to avenge his defeat to Mayweather last year in the richest fight in boxing history.
“I feel young. I feel like I’m just 25, or that I’m just 28 years old,” Pacquiao told ABS-CBN television.
Asked if he wanted to fight Mayweather again, Pacquiao said: “Of course, if he wants to come back (to) boxing”.
Pacquiao fuelled talk of “Pacquiao-Mayweather 2” when he invited the undefeated American, who retired in September 2015, to attend his successful comeback against Jessie Vargas in Las Vegas on November 5.
Last week, Pacquiao teased fans about a possible rematch by posting pictures on social media wearing a suit bearing photos of him and Mayweather in the lining. But Mayweather, 39, said days later he had no plans to come out of retirement. AFP
