Load up on fibre to curb diabetes

High fiber diets could control diabetics’ blood sugar better than we ever realized, new research suggests. For decades, nutritionists have urged everyone - diabetes diagnosis or not - to have more leafy greens, whole grains, and bananas since their fiber content keeps digestion stable and smooth.
But new research by Rutgers University has found fiber plays a far more active role than ever recorded in nurturing the gut bacteria that control blood sugars and fats. The findings could pave the way to personalized high-fiber diets as a first-line treatment for the disease.
The researchers say it could also help to curb the rapidly climbing rates of diabetes diagnoses - driven by the obesity crisis - if more non-diabetics take up a high-fiber diet as well.
‘Our study lays the foundation and opens the possibility that fibers targeting this group of gut bacteria could eventually become a major part of your diet and your treatment,’ said Professor Liping Zhao, a microbiologist at Rutgers University-New Brunswick in New Jersey.
Type 2 diabetes can lead to a range of devastating problems from heart attacks and strokes to kidney failure, blindness and losing a limb. It develops when the pancreas makes too little of glucose controlling insulin, or when the body doesn’t use the hormone well. Gut bacteria produce short-chain fatty acids that nourish intestine lining cells, reducing inflammation and helping to control appetite. Foods high in fiber boost gut bacteria that control blood sugar by breaking down carbohydrates.
Last year, a study showed losing weight by following an 800-calorie-a-day eating plan for eight to 12 weeks can send the disease into remission. The more weight participants lost, the more likely patients were to see an end to the condition.
But while previous research has found increasing dietary fiber consumption may relieve type 2 diabetes, Professor Zhao and colleagues say they have finally unlocked the mechanism to explain why and how.
Professor Zhao’s pioneering high-fiber diet, which included whole grains and Chinese medicinal foods, followed participants for six years and found it re-balanced their gut bacteria. The study found dramatic improvements in those who followed the eating plan - in less than three months.
