Rs.136 bn profit by 39 state enterprises in 2017

Thirty nine State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) recorded a net profit of Rs. 136 billion in 2017 while 16 made net losses amounted to Rs. 87 billion, said Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera yesterday.
He further said that some of the SOEs have not yet achieved their fullest potential while other have recorded dismal performances that leaving room for a public outcry over the mismanagement of the country’s national resources.
Minister Samaraweera made these observations delivering the key note address at the Heads of the State Owned Enterprises Conference (SOEs) at the Colombo Hilton.
The event was organised by the Public Enterprise Department and the Finance and Mass Media Ministry to equip the Heads of State Owned Enterprises (SOE’s) with the operational aspects on certain financial and administrative instruments.
Minister Samaraweera also said that many of the SOEs are managing vital economic activities in Sri Lanka such as public transport, public utilities and services. Their conduct of business plays an essential role in the daily life of the people, together with the productive performance of the country’s national economy. The Minister further said that in the Vision 2025 document, the government’s policy on the management of public enterprises that proposes to eliminate unproductive expenditure is envisaged in which it pledged to restructure SOEs to enable them to operate as commercially viable ventures with accountability.
“During 2017, 55 public ventures alone have recorded a total turnover of nearly Rs.1, 800 billion which was almost 13.22 percent of the GDP. Out of the 55 SOEs, 39 recorded a net profit amounting to Rs.136 billion while 16 made net losses amounting to Rs. 87 billion in 2017. The total asset base of SOEs grew by 13.6 percent in 2017 over 2016 and it accounted for almost 56.8 percent of the GDP,” Minister Samaraweera said.
“However, despite their strategic importance, SOEs have not achieved
full potential, which is reflected by its low Return Over Assets (ROA) ratio at 0.64 percent,” Minister Samaraweera said.
“The reasons for such underperformance range from lack of Good Governance practices, including lack of a clear accountability mechanism, policy and legal framework, to a weak supervisory role. I encourage you to address those difficult, but serious issues at your deliberations today”. The Minister also said that the performance of some SOEs in the recent years has been a source of concern for the fiscal balance. He added that total government revenue in 2017 declined from 14.2 percent to 13.8 percent, influenced by a drop of revenue from SOEs reaching a 50 percent decline in dividends and levies as compared to 2016. In 2017, four of the main loss making SOEs specially Ceylon Electricity Board, SriLankan Airlines, Sathosa and Agriculture and Agrarian Insurance Board combined in losses amounting to Rs.84 billion.
“I may say this as a dismal performance that creates public outcry over the mismanagement of our national resources,” Minister Samaraweera said.
The Minister also said that given the importance of the SOE’s, the government’s strategy is to encourage and facilitate the SOEs to be self-sufficient through improved corporate practices, management reforms, innovative financing, strong and prudent financial management, exposure to competitiveness and international best-practices and effective human resource management, while enhancing public accountability. It is pertinent that 2018 Budget allocated funds to operationalise the National Agency for Public Private Partnership (NAPPP), which would be the single facilitation point for all stakeholders in designing and implementing PPPs.
He added that the SOEs must now make efforts to closely work with the NAPPP in compliance with the PPP initiatives to gain the strength of the private sector to remain viable business operations.
“The Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) has adopted a new approach with the introduction of the Statements of Corporate Intents (SCIs) to support your entities,” Minister Samaraweera said.
“The SCI is a statement that contains key performance indicators targeting the core activities of the entity which will be reflected in improved financial and non-financial performance. During 2017, five key SOEs became party to the SCI, having signed tripartite agreements. I encourage all of you to follow suit without any delay.”
“We cannot pass on the cost of inefficiency on to the consumer or the public and therefore, it is essential that SOEs eliminate management inefficiencies prior to the implementation of fully cost reflective pricing,” the Minister said.
“As the key players in our national ventures, you may have to relook at your operations seriously to achieve reasonable management improvements in the interest of our fellow citizens,” the Minister added.
Minister Samaraweera also said that the objectives of the entity should be achieved effectively and efficiently having utilized the available resources. He added it was important that the Boards and the senior management exhibit due diligence given that the resources under their custody are non-other than public property.
“It is noted that you are vested with a responsibility to ensure that the entities operate as commercially viable having exercised best business practices. This demands the appointment of personnel who are properly qualified and have the capacity to guide your entities to achieve their objectives. In this context the Treasury envisages conducting awareness programs for the members of Boards and the senior management on the best practices that must be adopted in guiding the operations of these entities,” Minister Samaraweera said. “I expect to see a marked improvement in your performance in the ensuing year to bring our economy to greater heights.”
Australian High Commissioner Bryce Hutchesson, Secretary to the Treasury Dr. R.H.S. Samarathunga also spoke.
Finance and Mass Media Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna was also present at the occasion.
