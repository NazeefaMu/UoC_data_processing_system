Why kill animals
Lot of discussions are going on about animal rights and compassion to animals. These discussions are related to a statement made by one of the Ministers.
Lot of people have misunderstood this subject.
In Sri Lanka it is not a secret that there are farms rearing chicken and pigs. Beef, pork, chicken and fish are available all over the country. We have very few vegetarians. Many Buddhists eat fish and meat. There are government departments managing fishing and farms.
But the Buddhist teachings have to be respected. People running farms and selling fish is not the fault of Buddhism. Anyone can do these things but do not drag Buddhism into these activities.
As Buddhists we do not ask others not to eat meat, fish and eggs. Bu we want to show what is right and what is wrong according to Buddhist teachings.
The key teachings of Buddhism about animals are these.
Animals and human beings share the same essential nature. We are not separate class of beings to whom a separate class of ethical rule applies.
The highest Buddhist virtue is compassion, which we are to show to all sentient beings at all time.
We should do all in our power to avoid causing suffering or death for any sentient being.
According to Buddhism, all beings tremble before danger. All fear death. When you consider this, you will not kill or cause someone else to kill. All beings fear before danger. Life is dear to all. When you consider this, you will not kill or cause someone else to kill.
