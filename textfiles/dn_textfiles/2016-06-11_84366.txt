MR did not vote as it is not worth his valuable time: Gammanpila

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa did not take part in the vote of No Confidence Motion against Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake because it is not worth his valuable time, Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Leader Udaya Gammanpila said.
He was responding to a question by a journalist at a press conference at the Parliamentary Complex yesterday.
“In Parliament, former President Rajapaksa’s vote is only another one vote, but he is a great personality and an exclusive citizen of this country. His vote must be special. It is useless to ask for his presence in the House, if his vote cannot change the final result. He did not vote at the previous budget as well. If you see former President Rajapaksa in the House for a vote, it will be a critical moment that signs the shift of political power,” he said.
