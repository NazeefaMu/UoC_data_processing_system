Lankans in Qatar safe - Ambassador

Sri Lankans resident in Qatar desiring to return to Sri Lanka could get their money converted into US dollars in Qatar before emplaning, Sri Lanka’s Ambassador in Qatar A.S.P. Liyanage said. He emphasised that Sri Lankans in Qatar are not affected in any way by the decision taken by several Arab countries led by Saudi Arabia to sever ties with Qatar. The Ambassador said daily activities in Qatar are continuing peacefully as usual however he said there was a heavy rush of passengers on outbound air traffic from Qatar. There is also a heavy rush of customers in supermarkets in cities clamouring to buy goods and essentials fearing a shortage of food in future. However Sri Lankans resident in Qatar need not entertain any doubts or fears about their future, he added. Any Sri Lankan needing further information in this regard should contact Liyanage on 0097455564936.
