DID MARY SING A LULLABY?

 The lights were dimmed as a gentle breeze swept across the cathedral when within the Festival of Nine Lessons, the Cathedral Choir spiritually rose to create the Nativity with a Sinhala lullaby, DOIYA, perhaps Mother Mary would have whispered in her heart as baby Jesus fell asleep, like all mothers do to their new born babes.
The music was set to a Sri Lankan rural background in tender Nocturne. The recreation was so prefect that every word sung by the soloist touched all hearts present and took us back to over two thousand years to a lowly manger in Bethlehem.
The magnificent choir with a single flute, violin, crass quintet, timpani and the Cathedral organ in the background was conducted by Ishan de Laneroll to the rendering of Doiya.
The Ven. Perry Brohier, Vicar of the Cathedral along with Rev Ernest Nadeem and Rev Ratnamala Ratnaraja, the assistant curates led the Festival of Nine Lessons that climaxed with the Nativity. A warm and touching sermon by Ven. Brohier soothed and mellowed our hearts towards the importance of why Jesus came into this world.
As the Cathedral prepared for this event, we were reminded of the sensitive needs of all Christians in the true Anglican tradition of welcoming people of all traditions to join in worship as a worshipping community comprising from believers from different walks of life.
WHY GOD SENT HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON
Let us reflect and recall in our hearts why God sent his only begotten Son. Every Christian or non-Christian have the answer; to save the world from sin. When His son grew up, he was prepared to take our sins upon him and save us. The important thing is not wherher our faith is great or small, weak or strong. What is important is the object of our faith. Why baby Jesus had to sacrifice his beautiful unstained life for all. As much as nativity is joy, it also makes us sad because we all know where he is heading; to the cross.
Today is the birth of Jesus Christ and the beginning of thirty three years of his young life he will spend caring, nurturing his scattered sheep and bringing them together with loving tenderness to fulfill his mission on earth; spread the Word of God, his father in heaven who sent him to do so. As the Christian world celebrate the Christmas message, we as his chosen children must look beyond the lavish celebrations we coincide with the great day with extravagant spending gone commercial forgetting the true meaning of the WORD. No doubt it is the most joyful event in a Christians' life but eventually lead us to repent that we all are responsible for nailing him upon the cross by our misdoings, sins and disobeyance to God. It is this beautiful perfect baby Jesus who will make the supreme sacrifice to save us sinners.
Let us meditate, ponder and think on these terms as we welcome the Holy baby to our homes.
HOW IT ALL BEGAN
As promised God sent angel Gabriel to visit Mary; who lived in Nazareth in the town of Galilee. She had already pledged to marry a man named Joseph who was a descendent of kind David. The angle came and said 'Peace be with you. The Lord is with you and He has greatly blessed you.
The message troubled her as she wondered Gabriel's words but the angel assured her ' Don’t be afraid Mary. God has been generous to you. You will become pregnant and give birth to a son and you will name him Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High God.
The Lord God will make him a king, as his ancestor David was and he will be the king of the descendents of Jacob and his Kingdom will never end.
The confused Mary said to the angel. I'm virgin. How then can this be? and the angel answered :-
'The Holy Spirit will come on you and God's power will rest on you. For this reason the holy child will be called the Son of God. Remember your relative Elizabeth. It is said that she cannot have children but she herself is five months pregnant, even though she is very old.
For there is nothing that God cannot do'
MARY AND ELIZABETH
After the angel had left her, Mary who was very excited and happy, went off quickly to a town in the hill-country of Judaea where Zachariah and Elizabeth lived. The moment Elizabeth heard Mary's greetings, the baby within her moved. Elizabeth who was filled with the Holy Spirit and said in a trembling voice, 'Mary you are the most blessed of all women and blessed is the child you will bear. Why should this miracle happen to me that my Lord's mother come to visit me. For, sooner the I heard your greeting, the baby within me jumped with gladness. How blessed you are to believe that the Lord' message to you will come true' and Mary replied her,
'My heart praises the Lord. My soul is glad because of God my Saviour has remembered me, his lowly servant'
Later, Elizabeth gave birth to John the Baptist, the cousin of Jesus whose voice in the wilderness, praised the coming of Jesus and baptised him in the River of Jordan.
MARY AND JOSEPH
When Joseph heard of Mary's pregnancy, he was perturbed. How was he to marry her when she was already with child but Joseph was a man who always did the right thing and did not wish Mary to be disgraced publicly and decided to break off the engagement privately. As he was thinking about his dilemma, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said 'Joseph, thou art the descendent of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife. For it is by the Holy Spirit that she has conceived and she will have a son and you will name him Jesus and he will save the people from sin.
So, when Joseph woke from his dream, he married Mary as the angel of the Lord told him to do so.
Thus, Jesus was born in the town of Bethlehem in Judaea when Herod was the king.
In the list of ancestors, Jesus Christ was a descendant of David who was a descendent of Abraham. From Abraham to King David, there was this long list that came from a royal lineage to Joseph who married Mary, the mother of Jesus, the Messiah.
Then there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David, fourteen from David to the exile in Babylon and then fourteen from them to the birth of Jesus Christ.
Over two thousand years ago and in 3 B. C. there lived in the Judean Hills not far away from Jerusalam a new priest by the name of Zachariah who was very old along with his wife, Elizabeth who too had passed the age of having a child. but Zachariah had faith in God that nothing was impossible for him and served God in his temple. Suddenly Gabriel appered at the right side of the incense altar and spoke to him :-
'Have no fear, Zacharias because your supplication have been favourably heard and your wife, Elizabeth will become a mother to a son and you are to name him John. He will prepare the way to the Messiah.' He was frightened and would not believe what Angel Gabriel announced. People outside the temple were concerned why he delayed to come out and when he did, he was not able to talk.
The Angel punished him for not believing his word and until the baby was born, he would remain dumb. True to God's words, Elizabeth became pregnant and kept away from the temple for about five months.
