Arafat Sunny arrested

Dhaka: Bangladesh police Sunday arrested national cricketer Arafat Sunny for allegedly breaching strict internet laws after his girlfriend accused him of uploading sensitive photos on social media.
Police raided the home of the 30-year-old slow left-arm bowler in the Dhaka suburb of Aminbazar after his longtime girlfriend filed a complaint two weeks ago, said local police chief Jamaluddin Mir.
"She said Sunny opened up a fake Facebook account of hers and posted their personal photos, which she found offensive and defamatory," he told AFP. AFP
