Justice Murdu Fernando, new Supreme Court Judge

Addressing the gathering at the ceremonial sitting to welcome Justice M. N. B. Fernando to the Supreme Court, Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya delivered the following speech:
I am privileged and honoured for this opportunity to welcome President’s Counsel Justice Murdu Nirupa Bidushinie Fernando as a judge of the Apex Court of Sri Lanka. You would bring in with you, the experience gained through 34 years of service in the public sector. You are further-decorating the list of distinguished former members of the Attorney-General’s Department who were appointed as judges of the Supreme Court. With your appointment, a fair balance is maintained in the composition of the final Appellate Court.
Having served an institution that has a history exceeding 130 years, you are now joining another institution that had inherited a longer history; one which exceeds 200 years—the Supreme Court.
The Royal Charter of Justice issued in London on April 18, 1801, established a new Supreme Court of Judicature in Ceylon consisting of a Chief Justice and a Puisne Judge. This court was given both criminal and civil Jurisdiction including areas such as testamentary, matrimonial and revenue. Further, the court was empowered to admit persons to act as advocates or proctors, or both. The first Chief Justice Sir Codrington Edmund Carrington, opened its first session on February 12, 1802. Since then, the institution, that was entrusted with the power and authority to dispense justice, embarked on a journey of evolution in our legal system. You are joining this institution when it has completed four decades in its current form—The Supreme Court established under the Second Republican Constitution. This institution which evolved for more than 200 years, is enriched with its traditions, rules and practices.
Justice Murdu Fernando has taken upon the responsibility to protect, preserve and further-enrich its grandeur by joining with the Chief Justice and other Justices who had already embarked on this journey. The importance to protect those rich traditions, practices and rules, was echoed by Chief Justice Sir Stanley Fisher at a ceremonial Sitting on April 16, 1930, in the following words:
“Judges come and go, but the continuity of these courts is unbroken. The atmosphere remains and I do think that if it were possible for a judge of 50 years ago to return to these courts, he would at once, feel himself at home and recognise the same atmosphere and the same sense of justice animating and inspiring those who worked in these courts during his own days.”
Academic excellence achieved in fields of Trade Law and Practice and International Business Law, including the areas of Marine Insurance, Copy Rights and Related Rights, had further-strengthened your ability to discharge duties assigned to you in the Attorney General’s Department and thereby, serve the Republic effectively and efficiently. The University of Colombo and King’s College of the University of London, in recognition of your academic excellence, awarded you with a diploma and a degree of Master of Law, respectively.
Leadership qualities acquired, possessed and developed since schooldays, provided you the strength to supervise and manage nearly 100 members of the legal profession, serving in the Attorney General’s Department Civil Division.
An educational institution founded more than 14 decades ago by famous Philanthropist Sir Charles Henry De Soyza, Princess of Wales’ College in Moratuwa nurtured and guided you during your 13-year long student life. You not only excelled in studies, but also successfully contributed to many extra-curricular activities. They included oratorical contests, debating, literary associations and student movements. Leading the school debating team, winning special awards such as Best Debater, Junior Prize for the Most Outstanding Student; holding posts of House Captain, School Prefect and ultimately becoming the Head Prefect, are nothing but features of an excellent school career. It is from such an elevated pedestal that you conquered challenges in professional studies.
Completing both preliminary and final examinations at the Sri Lanka Law College with Honours, while becoming the first in the order of merit at the final examination and being further-decorated with the First Scholarship, the Sir Lalitha Rajapakse Memorial Prize and the A. B. Cooray Memorial Prize, reflects the strong foundation you laid to build this illustrious professional career.
You continued with legal studies and obtained a Bachelor of Law Degree from the University of Colombo. You have brought pride and honour to your alma mater similar to other distinguished past pupils such as the first female Member of Parliament Florance Senanayake and Lady Evlyn De Soyza, a member of the Senate.
Justice Murdu Fernando; State Counsel, Senior State Counsel, Deputy Solicitor General, Additional Solicitor General and Senior Additional Solicitor General are the different capacities in which you served the Attorney General’s Department; an institution which has a history of nearly 13 decades.
During your three-decade long career in the Attorney General’s Department, you attracted respect and honour from all quarters. The firm but pleasing manner with which you discharged supervisory duties, created a welcoming and conducive environment to all junior officers who sought your guidance and support. Duty to the state and responsibilities arising in the discharge of such duties, were the foremost considerations that attracted your attention.
Your diligent and committed service during the last 34 years in public service, has further-illuminated your path. Simplicity and patience are added qualities that you possess, that would help you to sustain and preserve respect and honour accumulated throughout this long journey and continue it with pride.
The advise and guidance you received from former President’s Counsels late Lena C. Fernando and late Eardly Perera during your apprenticeship and thereafter, would no doubt be of strength to you. Eardly Perera had recognised you as a person who is “Brilliant, hardworking and completely engrossed in the Law.”
Chief Justice Hema Henry Basnayake Q.C. aptly described the important role an independent and impartial Supreme Court plays in a society, at a ceremonial sitting on July 31, 1964.
“To people, the judiciary is the sole protection against tyranny, autocracy and intemperate acts of bureaucracy. To them, it is the forum in which the liberty of the subject could be asserted. It is the place where their wrongs can be remedied, be they committed by a fellow citizen or by the State. To them, it is the only forum in which they can challenge the State on even ground. Every step the government takes to preserve the independence of the courts, every measure introduced to safeguard them, will inevitably redound to its credit. No State is safe with a subservient judiciary. It is the bane of a country, and it enfeebles a nation and makes cowards of its citizens”
All achievements from your childhood coupled with your academic excellence, professional experience and skills developed as a Counsel, would bring in a blend, further-enhancing the quality of justice meted out by the Supreme Court. They would no doubt be of immense strength and courage to dispense justice not only to the satisfaction of parties who would come before you, but also society as a whole. The sense of fairness with which you had discharged duties at the Attorney General’s Department, reflects your ability to dispense justice to all parties equally, without fear or favour.
Whilst assuring you our fullest co-operation, I wish you a successful and pleasant tenure of office as a Judge of the Supreme Court!
Thank You.
