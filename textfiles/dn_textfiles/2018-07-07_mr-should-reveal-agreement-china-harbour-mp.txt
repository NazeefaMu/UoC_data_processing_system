MR should reveal agreement with China Harbour - MP

UNP Colombo District MP Mujibur Rahuman said yesterday that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa should reveal what kind of agreement he had with China Harbour company to receive US$ 7.6 million for his election campaign.
“As far as we know private companies do not give money to politicians without a reason.We like to know what former President promised to give them if he came to power,” he said.
Today, we are in a Chinese debt trap having obtained loans at highest interest rate of more than 6 percent. Both the Mattala airport and Hambantota port begun by former President from Chinese funds are loss making ventures today.
Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday, he called on President Maithripala Sirisena to appoint a special Presidential Commission to probe what kind of promises former President had pledged to China.
“We would also like to know whether this the attempt of selling public property to China. We know that many projects including Port city were given to China on a freehold basis.
Eventhough the China Harbour company had rejected the report published in the New York Times, in a recently issued press release, it had never said anywhere that they did not give money to the former President. So, we want to know whether Standard Chartered Bank too refused to issue cheques amounting to US$ 7.6 Million and US$ 3.7 M Dollars to Mahinda Rajapaksa’s 2015 Election Campaign via two Standard Chartered Bank accounts.
