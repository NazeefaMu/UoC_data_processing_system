Founder of Dusit International, receives SHTM Lifetime Achievement Award

Thanpuying Chanut Piyaoui, Founder and Honorary Chairperson of Dusit International, one of Thailand’s foremost hotel and property development companies, which also has presence in Sri Lanka has received the prestigious SHTM Lifetime Achievement Award from the School of Hotel and Tourism Management (SHTM) of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU).
Ranked among the top 3 “Hospitality and Leisure Management” institutions globally in the QS World University Rankings by Subject in 2017 and 2018, the SHTM is a symbol of excellence in the field.
Established in 2016, SHTM’s annual awards are designed to honour outstanding personalities who have contributed substantially to the development of hospitality and tourism in Hong Kong, the region and around the world.
This year, the recipient was selected in accordance with the theme ‘Celebration of Women in Leadership.’
Thanpuying Chanut established Dusit International in 1948 and opened her first property in Bangkok, Princess Hotel, in 1949. It was one of the first properties in the city to feature a swimming pool, an elevator, and air conditioning.
Determined to open a five-star hotel offering luxury hospitality with a distinctively Thai touch, in 1970 she achieved this aim with the opening of the flagship Dusit Thani Bangkok – then the city’s tallest, grandest building – which has been a true icon ever since.
Building on the success of this property, Thanpuying Chanut opened more five-star hotels in major tourism destinations in Thailand and overseas, and branched out into hotel and culinary education with the Dusit Thani College in 1993, and Le Cordon Bleu Dusit Culinary School, a joint venture with Le Cordon Bleu, in 2007.
