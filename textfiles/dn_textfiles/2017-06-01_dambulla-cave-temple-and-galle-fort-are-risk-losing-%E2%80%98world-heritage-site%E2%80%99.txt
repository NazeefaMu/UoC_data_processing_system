Dambulla cave temple and Galle Fort are at a risk of losing the ‘World Heritage Site’ status: Akila Viraj Kariyawasam

 
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam  said UNESCO has recently warned that Dambulla cave temple and Galle Fort would have to be removed from the World Heritage Site list considering the deterioration of their conditions.
The Minister made this revelation while addressing a press conference at Sirikotha today.
“The negligence of Archeological Department has contributed to this state of affairs. It has not taken adequate measures to conserve them during the previous reign. Now we have taken urgent measures to improve their conditions and conserve them. We have also sought the help of international experts in this regard,” the Minister said.
Minister Kariyawasam further said that law has not been implemented by the previous government for the illegal settlements in these heritage sites. And Department has failed to identify the archeological sites and mark their boundaries in the East after the war ended.
Now the law is strictly implementing and illegal settlements are not allowed in reservation areas the Minister added.
