Fertilizer shortage over from January 1

The country's current scarcity of fertilizer ends after December 31. We commence distributing fertilizer, especially urea, from December 30 on the basis of 3,000 MT of fertilizer for each district. As such, no farmer is required to amass fertilizer in bulk in fear that the shortage would continue, said Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake.
He said according to information, some fertilizer agents are responsible for exaggerating the shortage while the act of some farmers hoarding fertilizer at domestic level aggravated the scarcity unnecessarily, the Minister said.
He was speaking at a local government election rally held at Solama Village in the Thambuttegama area, where nearly 100 UNP supporter families crossed over to the SLFP before the minister received the party membership.
The farmers, who were present at the meeting, questioned the minster about measure to take during inadequate rain, earning livelihoods, the scarcity of fertilizer in the market and poor distribution of fertilizer through agrarian service centers as an alternative method, which as a whole hampered the cultivation efforts at the verge of elections.
The Minister responding to inquiries said the shortage was created as the consignment of 40,000 MTs of fertilizer to be brought from Pakistan was not executed. Pakistan stopped the delivery of stocks since Pakistan itself suffered a scarcity. He said as a temporary measure, the government purchased 7,000 MTs from private companies locally at a higher price and distributed them among farmers at Rs. 2,500 per bag.
“A shipment of 75,000 MTs of fertilizer will arrive here and we are providing 3,000 MTs of fertilizer initially, including urea, to all districts by December 31. Farmers should not buy fertilizer at exorbitant prices. We feel that there should be a large-scale agricultural fertilizer processing project based in Eppawala Phospate deposit, to address local fertilizer needs. Also, we are determined to accelerate the carbonic fertilizer industry on village to village basis, Minister Dissanayake said.
He said farmers, who have undergone heavy agricultural losses in four consecutive seasons, are suffering.
In the Anuradhapura district alone, the government, so far, spent Rs. 1,500 million for the distribution of dry food rations among 140,000 farmer families and continue to do so depending on the rainfall. He said it was a pity that some bankrupted and power greedy political characters are unwarrantedly using natural disasters such as drought, flood, landslides etc in the election campaign against the government to hoodwink voters.
