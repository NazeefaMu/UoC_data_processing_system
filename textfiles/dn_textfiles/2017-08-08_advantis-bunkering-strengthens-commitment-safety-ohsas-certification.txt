Advantis Bunkering strengthens commitment to safety with OHSAS certification

Advantis Bunkering was recently awarded the International Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series certification or OHSAS 18001:2007 by Société Générale de Surveillance (SGS), the world’s leading inspection, verification, testing and certification company.
The certification covers all three legal entities of the business: Moceti International (Pvt) Limited, Lanka Bunkering Services (Pvt) Limited and Lanka Maritime Services Limited.
The OHSAS 18001:2007 certification was awarded following a stringent evaluation process of the health and safety standards maintained by the company.
It ensures that all employees are trained to carry out all operational activities without incident and in the event of an incident are able to minimize and mitigate further adversities.
Furthermore, the OHSAS uses a management approach tool called the PDCA (Plan, DO, Check, Act) cycle, which is an ongoing process that enables an organization to establish, implement and maintain its health and safety policy based on top management leadership and commitment to the safety management system.
“The safety of our employees is of paramount importance to us. Providing them with a safe working environment is a responsibility we take very seriously. This drives us to minimize risks associated with health and safety within the workplace.
This dedication has allowed us to maintain an impressive safety track record and this latest certification is further validation of our commitment to the highest safety standards,” said Advantis Bunkering Director Praneeth Gunawardena.
Advantis Bunkering is a fully owned subsidiary of Hayley Advantis Limited, the transportation and logistics arm of Hayleys PLC. Established in 2008 Advantis Bunkering is built on a combination of strengths of Moceti International (Pvt) Limited, Lanka Bunkering Services (Pvt) Limited and Lanka Maritime Services Limited. The company has established itself as a reliable bunker supplier at all ports in Sri Lanka, and went on to expand its services to the Maldives in 2016.
OHSAS 18001 is an Occupation Health and Safety Assessment Series for health and safety management systems and is intended to help organizations mitigate occupational health and safety risks. It was developed in response to the widespread demand for a recognized standard against which to be assessed and certified.
