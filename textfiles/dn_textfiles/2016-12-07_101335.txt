IPL 2017 in real danger: BCCI

The Indian Cricket Board (BCCI) is walking on very thin ice as far as the 2017 edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) is concerned. With the T20 tournament scheduled to begin on April 8, there are only four
months left before the first ball is scheduled to be bowled and the BCCI says “not a single contract has been signed yet”. From hosting of player auctions to planning logistics, hiring of creative
and management agencies, advertising the league and signing up with a host of vendors for the two-month long cricketing extravaganza have been pending for more than two months already .
After the Supreme Court hearing got adjourned from December 5 to 9 on Monday, a top BCCI official admitted that the Board was staring into an abyss with the IPL. - TNN
