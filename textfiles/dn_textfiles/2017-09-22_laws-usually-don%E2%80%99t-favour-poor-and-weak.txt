Laws usually don’t favour the poor and weak

The Sykes- Picot agreement was horrendous:
The idea of states with boundaries was a colonial export:
Law is an instrument of Politics:
Prof. Alfred H.A. Soons, Emeritus Professor of International Law, University of Utrecht, academic and international jurist, visited the Island on the invitation of the Moragoda International Law Trust recently to deliver a series of lectures.
Since 2014, each year a renowned academic in the field of Public International Law has been invited to conduct workshops at the Kotelawala Defence University as the “Moragoda Endowment Professor of Public International Law.” The past invitees of the yearly workshops include Prof. Terry Gill of the University of Amsterdam, a specialist in International Humanitarian Law in August, 2014; Prof. Veerle Heyvaert of the London School of Economics who conducted a series of successful workshops on International Environmental Law in August, 2015 and Prof. (Dr.) V. Balakista Reddy, Professor of International Law, Coordinator M.K. Nayambar SAARC Law Center and Head, Center for Air and Space Law, NALSAR University of Law, Hyderabad in September, 2016.
Taking time off his schedule during which he was to deliver a series of lectures on the Laws of the Seas, Prof. Soons spoke to the Daily News on a gamut of contentious issues with regard to International Law and its applicability in the Sri Lankan context.
Following are excerpts of the interview:
Q: Professor, the book that you had written titled The Right to Self-determination and the Dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles, was a fascinating read. If you could help us understand the process which as the subject matter of the book and on the crux of which was the issue of self determination?
A: This is another area that is close to my research interest. The right to self determination in international law I think, is really still highly relevant in many areas of the world. Within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, it still plays a role with regard to the six islands in the Caribbean which formed part of the kingdom. We have 6 islands that still belong to the Kingdom of the Netherlands and those islands have an individual right to self determination. So it’s interesting that within the kingdom of the Netherlands which most of the world identifies as this country in Europe, there is still 300,000 people living in the six islands in the Carribean that are still a part of the Kingdom of Netherlands and they have a right to self determination. Their status is separate from the status of the population in Europe. I have to always explain to my countrymen that within the Kingdom of Netherlands, that we have seven units of peoples. One, the vast majority of them in the Netherlands and then the six islanders in the Caribbean, with populations varying from 150,000 to 2,000. They are individual units of self determination. This is the result of the fact of our colonial past. The Kingdom of Netherlands until 1949, was a very big colonial power. What is interesting to see is that, what you often see with states consisting of islands is that the populations of these islands go their own separate ways. Unless the populations have for a long period been so close together, they have been one social community. If that is not the case there is this need for autonomy. The Netherlands had to struggle with that as well. It’s a complicated thing with the Netherlands even to explain. This obviously is a consequence of colonization and creating new societies which by colonial administrations were put together because they were very close together. It is a very obvious thing to do in a colonial perspective, but it didn’t succeed. In the sense that it didn’t really form one single nation, which led to this splitting up although attempts were made to prevent it. This is some sort of the general background to this issue.
Q: Sri Lanka has inherited a part of the legacy of colonisation resulting in the call for self determination by one section within the island, resulting in a long drawn out civil war. Do you see parallels ?
A: One of the fascinating aspects of dealing with these issues and getting to know more about local situations is by travelling to them , is that they are ultimately all unique. Just like any person is unique, countries are unique. They are a product of history. And even though colonial times have had a big impact, if you take Sri Lanka for example, history goes back to thousands of years. But with what I spoke of on the Caribbean and the Kingdom of Netherlands, the peoples living there are relatively recent products of colonization. That’s a combination of the conquering of the Spanish, the British, the Dutch etc., and the importation of slaves from Africa which had a huge impact on the Caribbean, which it still has. You could say that most of the current population started only around the 17th century through importation from outside, which include the slaves. The traffic to the Caribbean went on and in the 20th century, because of oil refineries in some of the islands - it attracted thousands of workers from within and outside the region. On some plantations also in the British Caribbean island, no slaves were imported, but migrant workers from India were imported to work in Sugar Cane fields. So in the Caribbean you may have many people of Indian descent. You also have Chinese families living in these islands. So populations which are now units of self determination under the UN decolonization rules, were relatively recently created communities.
Now when you come to Sri Lanka, you get a totally different picture. These are ancient communities which have developed over thousands of years and in addition what you have to keep in mind always is that the European notion of states, as the main subject of international law for a number of centuries now, since the 17th century. The Europeans in their colonization of the rest of the world, exported their notion of the state in the European sense. This meant relatively clear boundaries. You could live on one side of the boundary or the other side of the boundary, but that made a huge difference because people on one side of the boundary you would be a subject of State A and on the other side a subject of State B.
I think that in Africa and in Asia, the notion of state was completely different in varying degrees. Perhaps in India, you also had the notion of boundaries, but in most parts of Africa and Asia, the belonging was to a community. The community had local rulers and superior rulers and may have been an ultimate ruler. But the communities under their local ruler often changed their loyalties or had loyalty to two competing super rulers far away. They paid tribute to the two superior rulers to keep the peace and after awhile, they may have changed their loyalty to another, without really fixing limits and boundaries.
So the Europeans when fixing the boundaries tended to look at rivers or mountain ranges as a nice boundary. But for the local people in Asia and Africa, rivers were not boundaries, the rivers were used by the same people of the same community. They used the two sides of the river. When the Europeans decided they had colonies and that they needed boundaries between the French, the British, the Dutch, the Portuguese, etc., they often used rivers as a boundary. So they split the same community of people in two as a result, even though they were one people and one nation.
What I understand of Sri Lanka is that you have different peoples - Sinhalese, Tamils, Moors and some others. The Tamils are one people which has ethnic, cultural, religious ties with mainland India. But I suspect that the same applies to the Sinhalese people. I understand that Sri Lanka has always been a separate kingdom in competition or cooperation with different nations such as India.
Q: Yes. Just as you explained the working of the pre colonial nations
A: Yes this is my limited understanding of Sri Lanka. I have only superficial knowledge about her. But Sri Lanka appears to be a State which includes in an ethnic sense, several peoples and that means you have a majority or a few majorities and minorities. One of the minorities predominantly lives in a particular geographic area. I have no idea of the quality of how these communities lived together in pre-colonial times. During colonial times, you had the colonial power governing the entire area who dictated how “living together” should be and how they must live together. Usually, the call for self determination starts with the call for more autonomy and equality in civil and political rights. But the more the minority is suppressed or there is perceived suppression which often is not understood by the peoples themselves and is assisted by outsiders to really understand the nature and degree of relations and as to the actions of the majority are suppression or not. Perception is more important than reality and it helps if you could demonstrate the understanding of need for respect of minority rights which are often cultural and religious. If it is only cultural and religious, it could be accommodated. Language could also be accommodated with no discrimination at all. But if there is a social economic feeling of not being well looked after, then we often see conflict. You can see what happened in Ireland for example, where the religion and social economic issues took to the fore even among ethnically the same people. It was the social cultural differences which have developed over the centuries which ultimately took to the fore.
If you don’t take care of those concerns by the majority for the minority, then you very often see developments of the minorities wish for autonomy expressed in ultimately violent ways. That I suspect is what happened here. I hope it will not resurface.
Q: That is a very fascinating breakdown you gave on the intertwining of these complex issues. On the same lines, the question of Kurdisthan. If one goes to Istanbul, Ankara, or Izmir any Turk would tell you that there really is no problem for the Kurds and that they are as equal as everyone else in Turkey. They will tell you that they don’t see logic in what is being fought for by the Kurds. You see the same phenomenon here. When you talk to a person living in the South, they would point out to the constitution and ask you “ tell me what in this document discriminates of a minority”, and if you look at it, it is very hard to point out. What is your understanding of these factors?
A: I am a lawyer, not a sociologist or anthropologist. Of course my specialization is in International Law which is closely related to the social sciences. Conversely, social sciences and politics play a huge role in this area of law. Sciences are sciences, but Law is an instrument of politics, which makes law different. Purely formal assurances are apparently not satisfactory. Why sometimes it is and sometimes it is not - probably only can be explained by knowing a lot about the particular history of the situation.
For example the Kurds in fact, have in the background of their minds, I think, that they were promised and for a very brief time had their own state. Many of them wished for the establishment of that state. And perhaps its from the perspective of what you don’t have, do you look at what others have and feel that what you get isn’t enough. As I said, all these issues are unique. The issue of the Kurds is a nice example of how unique these issues are. The people who regard themselves as Kurds, live in three or four states across these boundaries. But these boundaries across these areas were made after the first World War by the French and the British.
Q: The Skyes - Picot agreement?
A: Yes. This was a horrendous legacy of colonialism. Of the way the powers of the day thought they could arrange things and rule the world in their interest. Huge mistakes in the long term by not recognizing the uniqueness of the people. Now in Sri Lanka’s case, I don’t know enough about how autonomous in their daily lives they were in the past. And how independent they were in taking care of their economic and social needs throughout history. Was there any sort of autonomy? So I would be interested in learning more about that. The Tamil militancy started in the late 1960s and what triggered that I don’t know. There must have been something in their perception of how they were being governed that they were not recognised sufficiently as being a separate state. With separate wishes wanting to do things differently, than the Sinhalese majority. There must be an explanation in the background there, which I don’t know much about.
I read somewhere that the Sinhalese majority thought that during colonial times that the Tamils were almost favoured by the British. If that is true, there could’ve been some resentment on the part of the majority against the minority for its previous privileged position. But I have no idea to what extent this is true.
Q: To give you a bit of perspective Professor, it was the elitist of the Sinhala and Tamil Community who dominated and decided on the day to day decisions affecting the masses. They were supporters of the British or the colonial masters and there was also the caste and class issue which I think, played a dominant role in both the South and the North Militancy. It is all intertwined. Moving on Public International Law is seen as a fallacy, it’s viewed as a tool to oppress the small nations. As a jurist what is your stake on this?
A: Such a general view must be immediately rectified by pointing to areas in which this is obviously not the case. For example, the right to self determination, which is a product of International Law. The right to self determination was primarily a construct of the United Nations with respect to colonized people - and it goes beyond it. So we have self determination issues in Europe. What I mentioned about the Caribbean - where they had the right to Self Determination - comes from international law. International Law provides for this and that is one example. The whole areas of Human Rights law and International Humanitarian Law where the individuals rights are recognized are also made certain now. Although Human Rights Law is a rather recent construct, international humanitarian law - the law applicable during armed conflict is centuries old. It is an area of international law today, which you cannot just do away with and say it is in the interest of big powers. That is complete nonsense.
But at the same time of course in many respects, International Law like any law, is a reflection of power configuration at any moment. In many countries there are a lots of law that are either enacted by Parliament or enacted by an authoritarian system, but many laws are established and adopted which favour particular interests. Usually they don’t favour the poorest part of the population. Look at what is happening in the United States. Big economic interests have much more chance of being heard and accepted and their interests represented in national legislation over the weak and the poor. This happens in any society. So it cannot be a surprise that in international law which developed over centuries, which is in fact the Public Law of Europe, exported all over the world and since developed, is a reflection of this. However, the newly independent states since the developments following the Second World War to this area of law have made a significant impact on International law. Where not only the rich and powerful have had a say. So the law cannot only be regarded as representing the interests of the strong.
