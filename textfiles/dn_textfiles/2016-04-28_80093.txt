Minister refutes drug shortage charges

 
 There is no shortage of drugs in hospitals, assured Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne.
He said some sections of the media without proper facts had mistakenly reported recently that there was a drug shortage in the country. He challenged any one to provide the facts if there was a drug shortage at hospitals.
The minister made these observations at yesterday’s Cabinet press briefing at the Information Department Auditorium.
Dr. Senaratne said the government spends billions of rupees on drugs for the country’s free health service.
Over 1,400 types of drugs are available at hospitals and only 16 types of drugs which are rarely used are in short supply at hospitals.
“If there is a shortage of drugs, just point out to us where such a shortage exists and what type of drug is not available,” the Minister requested. “The other matter is if someone makes baseless allegations about substandard drugs, it is the private sector that stands to benefit.
The quality of drugs at public hospitals are far better than those of private hospitals,” he said.
The minister added that measures are also being taken to provide more MRI scanners to the Colombo North and Kalutara Hospitals.
Parliamentary Affairs and Mass Media Deputy Minister Karunaratne Paranavithana and Military Spokesman Brigadier Jayantha Jayaweera were also present.
