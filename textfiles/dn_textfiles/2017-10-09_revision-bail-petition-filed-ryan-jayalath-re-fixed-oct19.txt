Revision bail petition filed by Ryan Jayalath re-fixed for Oct.19

 
The Colombo High Court today deferred for October 19 to consider a revision bail application filed by Medical Faculty Students' Action Committee Convener Ryan Jayalath.
Medical Faculty Students' Action Committee Convener Ryan Jayalath arrested on charges of causing damages to public property by forcibly entering the premises of the Ministry of Health during an anti-SAITM protest had been ordered to be further remanded by Maligakanda Magistrate's Court.
When the revision bail application came up before High Court Judge A.A.R. Heiyanthuduwa, the Attorney General sought a further date for hearing.
Through this revision application, the petitioner Ryan Jayalath sought an order against the Maligakanda Magistrate’s Court refusal to grant bail. The petitioner is seeking an order to release him on bail.
