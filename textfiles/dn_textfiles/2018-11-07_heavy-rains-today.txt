Heavy rains today

The Meteorology Department predicted a heavy fall above 100mm in the Northern, North-central, Eastern, North-western, Central, Uva and Sabaragamuwa provinces today.
It also advised naval and fishing communities to be alert on the weather advisories on temporarily strong gusty winds (up to 70-80 kmph) and rough seas.
“Under the influence of the low-pressure system in the vicinity of Sri Lanka, a showery and cloudy condition is expected to continue over the island and surrounding sea areas.
Misty conditions may occur at some places in the Central and Sabaragamuwa provinces in the morning.
Fairly strong gusty winds up to 50-60 kmph can be expected over the island, particularly over the Northern half of the island,” the Department said in its weather bulletin.
The highest rainfall during the 24-hour period ended at 8.30 am yesterday and it was reported in Kiran in Batticaloa (270mm).
Polonnaruwa too received a rainfall exceeding 100 mm. Rantambe and Randenigala hydro catchment areas too received 195mm and 107mm rainfalls.
