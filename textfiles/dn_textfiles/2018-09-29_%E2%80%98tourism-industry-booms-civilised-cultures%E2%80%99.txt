‘Tourism industry booms in civilised cultures’

The relationship between the tourism and the culture of a given country is indispensable, Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Ministry Additional Secretary Ashoka Siriwardena said.
He was addressing the gathering at the ceremony organised by the Galle Project Office of the Central Cultural Fund to mark the World Tourism Day on Thursday.
He said that if the culture of a country is affected by its tourism or technology that is a disaster and the Pindurangala incident is one of them. Siriwardena said the authorities have already taken measures to prevent such incidents.
“Civil organisations and the public should directly involve to prevent such incidents,” he said.
“The culture helps develop the tourism industry of a country and modern technology should not affect it.” He said the youth should not misuse the freedom given by this government.
“The freedom sans discipline destructs a country,” he said.
