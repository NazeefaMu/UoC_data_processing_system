Dialysis machines to be increased to 1000 by 2018 end

The number of total dialysis machines available in Sri Lanka will be increased up to 1000 by the end of next year (2018), Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Senaratne said only 159 dialysis machines were available in Sri Lanka by the time the Government came into power in January 2015 and now there are 450 dialysis machines in the country. A new dialysis unit at the National Hospital of Sri Lanka in Colombo was opened yesterday.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that a proposal had come from an Indian company to bring 900 dialysis machines to Sri Lanka and install dialysis units. If the discussions end successfully 900 more dialysis machines will be added to the total number of dialysis machines available in the county.
The human resources required for dialysis units will be supplied. At the moment there are 31,000 trained nurses in the service but another 6000 trained nurses are required to meet the full demand, he added. A total of 30 dialysis machines installed at the NHSL and a total of 30,000 dialysis sessions conducted annually in the NHSL and at the National Institute for Nephrology, Dialysis and Transplantation.
