Singer Under 19 Division 1 first round-match roundup

Lasith shines in Maris Stella’s triumph
Lasith Croospulle, one of the all-rounders who performed creditably during the last school-season at U19 level for De Mazenod, making yet another useful all-round contribution helped his new school Maris Stella collect first-innings points over St.Joseph Vaz, Wennappuwa in one of the Group D matches of Singer U19 D1 Tournament 2016/17 concluded on Tuesday at Katuneriya-Sebastian’s ground.
Put into bat, Joseph Vaz scored a modest 172 with Dananjaya Perera (48) and Anjana Rukmal (43) making top contributions with the bat before Lasith Croospulle-led batting helped Maris Stella gain a healthy first-innings lead of 70 in their reply. Joseph Vaz in their second innings batted more confidently to reach 205 for eight at close on the back of two good scores from first innings top scorer Dananjaya Perera who made 94 in his second effort and a useful 65 from Madushan Ranatunga. Lasith Croospulle following his 67 with the bat collected a match-bag of seven wickets to finish with a good all-round performance for Maris-Stella.
St. Jospeh Vaz College, Wennappuwa: 172 in 59.3 overs (Dananjaya Perera 48, Anjana Rukmal 43, Madushan Ranathunga 26, Lasith Croosepulle 3/28, Sachindu Kolamabage 2/14, Sanka Poorna 2/16) & 205/8 in 65 overs (Dananjaya Perera 94, Madushan Ranatunga 65, Lasith Croosepulle 4/67, Pasindu Madawa 4/60) – (8.27 points)
Maris Stella College, Negombo: 242 in 67.5 overs (Lasith Croosepulle 67, Kevin Perera 47*, Sadeesha Perera 48, Ashan Fernando 25, Madushan Ranathunga 3/47, Dananjaya Perera 2/42, Kanishka Nanayakkara 2/53) – (13.92 points)
Harin and batsmen carry St. Aloysius to top of group C
St.Aloysius College, Galle further strengthening their position in Group C surged to their second innings-victory within their group beating Moratu Vidyalaya by an innings and 40 runs on Thursday. It was their second comprehensive win after they beat Gurukula by an innings and 34 runs in their opening group game this season. After a tremendous batting display, with four of their top order making fifty-plus scores, a dominant bowling effort by Harin Weerasinghe with a 10-wicket match-bag helped Aloysius become a team to be reckoned with in their group collecting a good 46.23 points from just two matches out of eight fixed within their group. Nishantha Madhushka scoring a solid 76 helped Moratu make a reasonable 163 in their first innings, but their woeful batting in the second innings cost them the match by a wider margin.
Moratu Vidyalaya: 163 in 72.5 overs (Nishan Madhushka 76, Isuru Udayanga 24, Harin Weerasinghe 4/48, Kavishka Dilshan 3/35) & 80 in 32.3 overs (Harin Surasinghe 6/21) - (3.43 points)
St. Aloysius College, Galle: 283/4 dec. in 58 overs (Ashen Bandara 67, Gimhana Ashirwada 65, Navindu Nirmal 59*, Niluksha Dulmina 53, Hareen Weerasinghe 30*) - (22.33 points)
Ushan and Nadeeshan bowl Dharmasoka to a nine-wicket win
Ushan Nimantha and Kavindu Nadeeshan accounting for 13 of the 20 wickets to fall in Gurukula’s two innings at a cost of just 97 runs made the task of their batsmen easy as Dharmasoka chasing just 31 runs to win the match outright got home in just under five overs to win the match by 9 wickets collecting useful 20.68 points. Ambalangoda school’s Ravindu Roshantha (71) and Kasun Madhuranga (43) batting with a tremendous composure extended a great support to their bowlers in achieving this morale-boosting victory. Though Gurukula lost this match, the single-handed effort of Udara Ravindu with the bat was the most promising batting effort in this match as Udara missed out on centuries in both innings by just 5 and 14 runs and he was very unfortunate as he could turn neither of his efforts into a century which would have been thoroughly deserving . Gurukula’s fate in this match would have been a different one had another batsman of Udra’s caliber been in Gurukula lineup to support him.
Gurukula College: 180 in 58.2 overs (Udara Ravindu 95, Asintha Malshan 21, Kavindu Nadeeshan 3/13, Ushan Imantha 2/13) & 135 in 47.1 overs (Udara Ravindu 86, Ushan Nimantha 5/43, Kavindu Nadeeshan 3/28) - (5.9 points)
Dharmasoka College: 285 in 65.5 overs ( Ravindu Roshantha 71, Kasun Madhuranga 43, Kaveesh Kumara 24, Subash Lasanga 39*, Sachintha Chamith 4/92, Pruthivi Roosara 35/2) & 33/1 in 4.1 overs (Kaveesh Kumara 21) - (20.68 points)
Debian Buyzer’s ton gains first-innings points for St.Sebastian’s
Last year’s one of the joint-champions of U19 D1 Tournament, St.Sebastian’s College, Moratuwa scoring an imposing 340 with the help of Debian D Buyzer’s entertaining 129 collected vital first-innings points in their group match against Richmond College, another key-team in this tournament, after their bowlers led by Tharusha Fernando and Praveen Jayawickrama reduced Richmond’s first innings to 220 in which Dhananjaya Lakshan and Kamindu Mendis made the bulk of scoring. However, Richmond following on with a first innings deficit of 120 came back strongly to amass 262 for seven thanks to Kamindu Mendis’s match-saving century and force a draw in the end.
St Sebastian College, Moratuwa: 340 in 60.1 overs (Debian D Buyzer 129, Tharusha Fernando 83, Nuwanidu Fernando 31, Sandun Mendis 3/117, Thaveesha Abhishek 2/28) – (15.15 points)
Richmond College, Galle: 220 in 49.1 overs (Dhananjaya Lakshan 70, Kamindu Mendis 59, Thaveesha Abhishek 31, Adithya Siriwardana 22*, Tharusha Fernando 3/41, Praveen Jayawickrama 3/48, Nuwanidu Fernando 2/44) & F/O 262/7 in 76 overs (Kamindu Mendis 114, Hasaru Chamikara 48, Thaveesha Abishek 45, Dhananjaya Lakshan 21, Adithya Siriwardana 20*, Imesh Bandara 3/38, Praveen Jayawickrama 3/86) – (9.82 points)
Two tons by Sahan Suraweera and Sammu Ashan pilot Ananda to an innings-win
Sahan Suraweera’s 118 and Sammu Ashan’s 106 pushed Ananda to a huge 377 for four in just under 61 overs after Ananda won the toss and took the first lease on a typical batting track at Wesley ground before Ananda bowlers, Sammu Ashan and Dileepa Jayalath sharing 17 of 20 wickets to fall in Wesley’s two innings bowled Ananda to a three-innings win as runs accumulated by Wesley in their two innings were not sufficient to make Ananda bat for the second time.
Ananda College: 377/4 dec. in 60.5 overs (Sahan Suraweera 118, Sammu Ashan 106, Dushan Hettige 89, Asel Sigera 51*, Kavinda Dissanayake 2/107) – (24.77 points)
Wesley College: 153 in 32.3 overs (Sakunthaka Liyanage 52, Shamod Athulathmudali 33, Thilina Perera 20, Thisuraka Akmeemana 25, Sammu Ashan 5/66, Dileepa Jayalath 3/28) & F/O 214 in 65.2 overs (Thisuraka Akmeemana 45, Helitha Bambarenda 48, Movin Subasinghe 51, Sammu Ashan 3/78, Dileepa Jayalath 6/86) – (4.67 points)
Trinity crush Dharmaraja by an innings
A run-feast by Trinitians amassing 422 for six in just 72 overs with Shanmuganathan Shanogeeth and Hasitha Boyagoda both scoring centuries made things difficult for Dharamaraja when Trinity recorded a huge innings and 118-run victory over their town-mate in one of the U19 D1 group A matches ended at Asgiriya on Saturday. After batsmen’s heroic act, Trinity bowlers led by Thisaru Dilshan capturing an 8 for 31 in Dharmaraja’s first innings restricted Dharmaraja to a paltry 90 in the first innings and a stubborn 214 in the second to win the match with ease collecting as many as 25.22 points.
Trinity College, Kandy: 422/6 in 72 overs (Shanmuganathan Shanogeeth 136, Hasitha Boyagoda 109, S Percivel 51*, Niwantha Herath 4/66) – (25.22 points)
Dharmaraja College, Kandy: 90 in 29.5 overs (Niwantha Herath 30, Thisaru Dilshan 8/31) & F/O 214 in 65.4 overs (Deshan Gunasinghe 70, Udantha Amarakoon 47, Gihan Vitharana 33, Mohammed Shuib 3/21, Thisaru Dilshan 2/23, Shanmuganathan Shanogeeth 2/29) – (4.54 points)
Shashika’s ton highlight of DSS’ 9-wicket triumph
DS Senanayaka recording a comprehensive win in their opening Group-fixture whilst inflicting Anuradhapura their second outright defeat collected useful 20.96 points when they handed Anuradhapura a nine-wicket defeat in one of the U19 D1 Group C fixtures concluded on Friday at DCA ground, Anuradhapura. After Shashika Gamage with an unbeaten 137 and Vihan Gunasekara a brisk 51 set the tone for DSS’s early dominance with a first innings score of 306 for six in just 52 overs, DSS bowlers led by Muditha Lakshan did the rest forcing Anuradhapura to follow on with a first innings deficit of 172. However, Anuradhapura batsmen in a well improved batting performance after following on scored 209 with Sandaru Madhushan top scoring with 78 to make DSS bat again. DSS needing just 39 to win romped home with nine wickets to spare.
DS Senanayke College, Colombo: 306/6 dec. in 52 overs (Sashika Gamage 137*, Vihan Gunasekara 51, Shehzad Ameen 46, Dasun Himasha 25, Muditha Lakshan 24, Maduranga Sri Chandrarathna 2/108) & 40/1 in 5 overs – (20.96 points)
Anuradhapura Central College: 134 in 47.2 overs (Dhananjaya Thamvita 35, Maduranga Sri Chandrarathna 24, Muditha Lakshan 3/22, Dasun Himasha 3/23) & F/O 209 in 58.5 overs ( Sadaru Madushan 78, Dhananjaya Thamvita 38, Yasith Samaradiwakara 3/63, Muditha Lakshan 3/59) – (5.18 points)
Charana bowls St.Joseph’s out for 23, season’s second lowest total
St. Joseph’s rebounding in an amazing fashion after they were bowled-out for this season’s second lowest total of 23, scored 315 for nine in their second innings as Dineth Madurawala finishing with an unbeaten 144 deprived Thurstan of an easy outright chance. It was Thurstan’s Charana Nanayakkara who finished with a match bag of 11 wickets destroyed Joseph’s first innings picking up eight wickets of Joseph’s first innings for a mere 11 runs whilst Jehan Daniel completing a five-for did well with the ball for St.Joseph’s. Thurstan winning first innings points collected a total of 15.02 points
St Joseph College: 23 in 13.5 overs (Charana Nanayakkara 8/15) & 315/9 in 120 overs (Dineth Madurawala 144*, Shewon Fonseka 44, Pahan Perera 42, Jehan Daniel 21, Sandaru Dias 4/51, Charana Nanayakkara 3/76) – (8.88 points)
Thurstan College: 227 in 46 overs (Yeshan Wickramarachchi 69, Nipun Lakshan 38, Charana Nanayakkara 20, Jehan Daniel 5/81) – (15.02 points)
Krishan’s 253 sets up De Mazenod’s first-innings triumph
A dominant bowling effort by Deshan Fernando and Roshitha Senevirathne sharing all 10 wickets between them at 5 apiece followed by Krishan Sanjula’s blistering 253, seemingly the highest individual score this season steered De Mazenod to a first-innings win over Maliyadewa in one of the U19 D1 group D matches that ended in a tame draw at De Mazenod ground on Friday. Dananjaya Premarathna’s half century and Damitha Silva’s all-round effort including a five-for with the ball all were over shadowed by the bowler-roasting 253 of Krishan Sanjula.
Maliyadewa College: 167 in 41.3 overs (Dananjaya Premarathne 51, Damitha Silva 27, Supun Sumanarathne 26, Deshan Fernando 5/39, Roshitha senevirathne 5/42) & 210/8 in 70 overs (Dulaj Ranathunga 47, Dilshan Kollure 28, Pavithra Liyanage 26*, Damitha Silva 24) – (8.77 points)
De Mazenod College: 322 in 77 overs (Krishan Sanjula 253, Damitha Silva 5/92, Dilshan Kollure 2/17 ) – (16.72 points)
