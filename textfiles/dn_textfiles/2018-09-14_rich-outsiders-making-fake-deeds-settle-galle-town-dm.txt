Rich outsiders making fake deeds  to settle in Galle town - DM

The Fundamental Rights of many innocent people of the Galle town are violated as rich persons from outside Galle fraudulently prove their citizenship within the Galle Municipality by way of registering counterfeit deeds at the Land Registry, Telecommunications, Digital Infrastructure and Foreign Employment Deputy Minister Manusha Nanayakkara said.
He made the above statement at the Regional Coordinating Committee Meeting of Galle Four Gravets, held recently. Minister Vajira Abeywardana and Deputy Minister Manusha Nanayakkara co-presided at the meeting.
“The Grama Seva Niladhari of the Galle Fort has allegedly issued Certificates of Residence in respect of 74 newly settled families which is unbelievable and cannot happen. There are only 276 registered families in the Galle Fort. Latest reports reveal that 74 newcomer families have been registered at a stretch,” Nanayakkara said. “This development is impossible. A large majority of properties in the Galle Fort area are business places. Wealthy people substantiate their citizenship by way of preparing fake deeds spending exorbitant amounts of money thereby infringing many basic rights of the poor people of Galle who are the real citizens of the city,” the Deputy Minister further stated.
“It is reported that this duplicitous practice of preparing bogus deeds are mainly carried out in the China Garden, Mahamodara and Weliwatte areas. I urge the authorities to initiate a tangible investigation into this dishonest practice,” he added. In response to the Deputy Minister’s disclosure, Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardana ordered the Divisional Secretary to carry out a proper investigation into the charges raised by Nanayakkara.
