Electing Chairman, Vice Chairman for Chilaw UC postponed

Electing a Chairman and a Vice Chairman to the Chilaw Urban Council was postponed for another day by Wayamba Province Local Government Commissioner Ranjan Jayasinghe as the meeting summoned at the Chilaw Town Hall for setting up the council on February 27 had no quorum.
When the meeting began at 8.30 am yesterday, only nine members were present in the chamber whereas the 20 member council should have at least 10 members to ensure a quorum. The nine members present included seven UNP members one SLFP member and one JVP member.
When the SLFP member and former Chairman Hilary Prasanna opposed and walked away from the chamber, another SLFP member walked in and took his seat, but it was insufficient to ensure the quorum.
Although UNP members demanded the Local Government Commissioner to conduct the election, he ignored their plea and postponed the meeting.
The JVP member who was non committal remained silent at the meeting. There was tight police security around the Town Hall.
