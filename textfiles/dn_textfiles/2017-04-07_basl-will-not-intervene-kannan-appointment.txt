BASL will not intervene in Kannan appointment

The Executive Committee of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) has decided not to intervene in the appointment of R. Kannan to the High Court.
The BASL Executive Committee which met on April 5, studied the recommendations put forward by the expert committee consisting of past presidents who looked into the appointment and decided they would need to study the matter further, said BASL Secretary, Amal Randeniya yesterday. One of the recommendations put forward by the expert committee was that there was no just cause in asking for the removal of the judge as he had not violated Article 111 (2) of the Constitution which deals with the removal of judges.
Randeniya also explained that since the BASL had also earlier stated that they did not recommend such an appointment, they would now not intervene to either ask for his removal or continuance. The Judges Association however in a letter written to the BASL on April 4 has asked for an appointment to meet with the BASL over Kannan and Randeniya said that the meeting would most probably be arranged after the New Year.
