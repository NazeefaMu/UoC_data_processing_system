Increase in human – elephant conflict due to drought

A record increase in the human - elephant conflict is reported from Anuradhapura district with the prevailing drought.
According to information from wildlife conservation and district management sources, during the last six months, nine deaths had occurred as a result of wild elephant attacks in the district.
A majority of jumbos are killed due to swallowing ‘Hakka Patas’ - an explosive device hidden sophisticatedly inside a pumpkin.
Anuradhapura Government Agent R. M. Wanninayake told the Daily News that wild elephants are playing havoc invading remote villages such as Horowpothana, Kahatagasdigiliya, Kebithigollewa, Palagala, Palugaswewa and Thirappane DS divisions due to a lack of food and water in the jungle.
“We are receiving a large number of applications seeking compensation for damages caused to property including cultivations due to elephant attacks. During the last few months, we paid Rs. 1.5 million as compensation. The payment of compensation and gratuities on behalf of those killed by jumbos is being accelerated,” Wannianayake said. Meanwhile, it is learnt that the construction of electrified fences to an extent of around 800 km in the Anuradhapura district as proposed by the divisional secretaries has been dragging mainly due to the lack of funds and wrong information.
