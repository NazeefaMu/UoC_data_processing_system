‘Ex-SriLankan Chairman’s drivers received over Rs. 100,000 as OT’

When Nishantha Wickramasinghe was the Chairman of SriLankan Airlines from 2008 to 2014, two official drivers attached to the Chairman had received monthly overtime payments from Rs. 50,000 to over Rs. 100,000.
In contrast to this, after Ajith Nissanka Dias took over as SriLankan Airlines Chairman in 2015, his official drivers monthly overtime payment was not more than Rs. 28,000.
This was disclosed by Company Secretary of SriLankan Airlines Dalrene Thirukumar in her evidence before the Presidential Commission investigating alleged Fraud, Corruption and Misappropriation of State Funds and Assets on July 11.
Cross examined by Additional Solicitor General Neil Unamboowe PC, Thirukumar said Nishantha Wickramasinghe's official driver Vasantha Devapirya was paid Rs. 139,000 as overtime in February 2012, also for working 21 hours daily.
Devapriya had been paid Rs. 129,000 as overtime for June 2012 for working 18 hours daily. Lakmal Cooray, who was the other official drivers of Nishantha Wickremesinghe had been paid Rs. 188,000 in respect of June 2012 for working 23 hours daily. She said the official driver of Ajith Dias had been one Sudath Ranasinghe.
The Presidential Commission is chaired by retired Supreme Court Justice Anil Goonaratne. Its other members are retired Appeal Court Judge A.G.R. Amarasekara, retired High Court Judge Piyasena Ranasinghe and Director General Auditing Standards Monitoring Board W.G.K. Geeganage.
State Counsel Sajith Bandara is assisting the commission.
