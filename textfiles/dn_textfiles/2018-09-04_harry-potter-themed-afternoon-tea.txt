Harry Potter-themed afternoon tea

A hotel in Norwich will be putting on the most magical Harry Potter-themed afternoon tea this Christmas.
Muggles can line up at the Assembly House to fill their plates with Hogwarts-inspired delights from November 28 until January 2 next year.
Nicknamed the ‘School of Magic Afternoon Tea’, the experience will offer a ‘spellbinding selection of cakes, sandwiches and Philosopher’s Scones’ – and apparently you should most definitely get dressed for the occasion (which means cloaks and wands, people).
The cakes include the Boy Wizard’s Gateau Opera: the hotel’s signature cake with a scarlet and gold twist, topped with a tiny sugar scarf. Or try Dudley’s Knickerbocker Glory drizzled with Exploding Lemonade: A glass filled with chocolate syrup, strawberry compote, vanilla cream and scattered with lemon sherbet, freeze-dried raspberries and popping candy.
There’s also A Bolt out of the Blue Macaron – stuffed with a butterbeer flavoured filling and decorated with a glitter lightning bolt – and The Wizard’s Choosing Hat; a solid sugar hat to take away, placed on top of a chocolate-dipped mousse cake that hides a colourful vanilla secret.
Vegans need not be sad, because Assembly House presents vegan versions of The Wizard’s Choosing Hat and Dudley’s Knickerbocker Glory, as well as other vegan cakes such as ‘enchanting’ glittered shortbread and a chocolate wand. Yum! Metro
