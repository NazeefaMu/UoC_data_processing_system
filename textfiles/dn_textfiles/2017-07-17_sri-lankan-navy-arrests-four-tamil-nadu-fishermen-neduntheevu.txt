Sri Lankan Navy arrests four Tamil Nadu fishermen in Neduntheevu

 
Four Tamil Nadu fishermen were arrested by the Sri Lankan Navy today while fishing in their territorial waters, Indian Police said.
The fishermen from Jagadapattinam in Pudukottai district were arrested for fishing off Neduntheevu near the Sri Lankan coast and were taken to Kangesanthurai by the Sri Lankan naval men along with their boat.
This is the fourth time the Sri Lankan Navy arrested Tamil Nadu fishermen this month.
The fishermen ventured into the sea four days ago before they were arrested, they said.
On 13 July, seven fishermen from Mandapam near Rameswaram were arrested by the Sri Lankan Navy at Neduntheevu and taken to Kangesanthurai port, for allegedly fishing in Sri Lankan boarders.
The Tamil Nadu government has maintained that the retrieval of Katchatheevu, an islet ceded to Sri Lanka in the 1970s, was the "only solution" to the vexed fishermen's issue.
