CSD donates equipment to Thambalawewa Health Centre

The Thambalawewa, Jayanthipura Yaya - 05 Health Centre which was functioning under dire conditions due to the lack of equipment and facilities, were provided equipment, including a state of the art examination bed equipped with all modern facilities. Further, the Civil Security Department(CSD) also provided the Centre with clean water facilities by constructing a water supply network for the Health Centre.
The donation was made by the Director General of CSD Chandraratne Pallegama, who also declared open the water supply facility. The Health Centre caters to the health needs of the villagers, while providing maternal care, child care and infant care facilities through their relevant clinics.
However, due to the lack of facilities, the health officers were facing great difficulties in carrying out medical services.
The ceremony to hand over the equipment was attended by the Director General of the CSD Chandraratne Pallegama, Director Welfare Vajira Kumaratunge and Brigade Commander Colonel M.I.V. Fernando.
