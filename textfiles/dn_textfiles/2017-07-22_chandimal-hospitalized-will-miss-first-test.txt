Chandimal hospitalized, will miss first Test

Sri Lanka Cricket confirmed that Test captain Dinesh Chandimal has been hospitalised following a diagnosis of pneumonia yesterday morning.
The newly appointed captain, who led his side to a historic Test victory, chasing the highest ever total on Asian soil early this week contracted a viral influenza that has been dogging the Sri Lankan team over the past few weeks and was recommended a rest period of 3-5 days.
However he was hospitalised yesterday when increased symptoms showed a development of pneumonia.
Chandimal will miss the first Test against India at Galle from July 26-30 and in his absence the team will be led by veteran spinner Rangana Herath.
