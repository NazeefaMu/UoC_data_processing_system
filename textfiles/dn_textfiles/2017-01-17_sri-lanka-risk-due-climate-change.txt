Sri Lanka at risk due to climate change

Sri Lanka, which has become a victim of natural disaster in recent years, will be at a greater risk following climate change, especially global warming, Chairman of the Community Resilience Center (CRC) Dr. Novil Wijesekara said.
He said the next generation will be the ones which will face direct impact of the global climate change, and it is important to educate and empower the youth to go green, he said.
The Sri Lanka Youth Climate Summit (YCS)-2017 funded by the US embassy to Sri Lanka, is to take place from January 20 to 22 at MAS Athena Thulhiriya.
Dr. Wijesekara pointed out it is timely that such a summit on climate change being held, where Sri Lanka is at the verge of a severe drought.
The YCS is a dynamic climate education process to empower youth and create a network actively calls for sustainable development. YCS is organised by the Community Resilience Center (CRC), an organisation promoting community capacity against challenges such as natural disasters, environmental pollution and climate change.
The summit aims to create youth climate action champions provided with mentorship, advocacy, networking and resources.
Hundred university students from Sri Lanka have been selected to participate in the YCS.
The technical facilitation for the YCS is provided by the Wild Centre, New York, USA.
Climate Change Secretariat of the Ministry of Environment and Mahaweli Development is a technical partner for the summit.
The Wild Center Project Manager Jennifer Kretser said the Youth Climate Programme pioneered by their non-profit-organisation, started in 2008 and progressed rapidly to win the recognition of US President Barck Obama in 2014.
Responding to a question from the Daily News on the environmental perspective of the current large scale development projects taking place in Sri Lanka. Kretser said, as an organisation they are promoting the UN’s sustainable development goals.
Whatever and wherever the projects are, the Wild Centre promotes development programmes to assess the pluses and the minuses of those development projects and encourages finding a solution leading to sustainable development, she said.
Youth Climate Programme Coordinator of the Wild Centre Keiti Morgan said the best part of the YCS is the youth empowerment. The youth are given skills and tools while assisting them to become active young leaders in their communities and at a global level, Morgan said.
The crux of the YCS is the climate action plan created at the summit by the student participants for their own communities, which they want to actualise, she added. The Disaster Management Centre, Consortium of humanitarian Agencies, Janathakshana and many corporate sector organisations are accommodating the YCS.
