JO urges Government not to postpone PC elections

The Joint Opposition (JO) yesterday said they would send a letter to the Speaker of Parliament requesting him not to allow the Government to postpone the Provincial Council elections.
Former minister G.L. Peiris addressing the media in Colombo said the Government continued to postpone polls as they were afraid of going before the people.
He said the Government was continuing to violate the people’s mandate by postponing polls.
“JO will go to court if the Government makes an effort to postpone the PC elections,” he said.
