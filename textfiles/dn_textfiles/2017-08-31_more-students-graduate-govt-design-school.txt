More students graduate from govt design school

Almost 100 students graduated with diplomas from the Sri Lanka National Design Institute at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall on Wednesday. They joined about 500 interior designers who have graduated from the programme since 1997, Industry and Commerce Secretary Chinthaka Lokuhetti said.
The graduation “is a proof of the centre’s efforts to advance design education in the country,” he said.
The Sri Lanka National Design Institute was created through a Parliamentary Act in 1982. The institute is part of the National Design Centre. It is a service-oriented government corporation, aimed at developing local craftsmen, Lokuhetti said.
The interior design course is funded by student fees, he said. The National Design Centre also trains students in craft sectors like Palmyra, fibre and rubber, tailoring, textiles, and screen-printing.
“I call the youth of Sri Lanka to join the programmes, offered by the National Design Centre, and contribute to the government’s vision of one million employment opportunities that do not burden public funds,” Lokuhetti said.
