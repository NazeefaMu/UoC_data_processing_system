Government will defend decision makers of flood relief work: Wickramaratne

 
State Enterprise Development Deputy Minister Eran Wickramaratne said today that the Government will defend decision makers of the public sector involved in flood relief work.
He said this while addressing a press conference at Sirikotha.
Minister Wickramaratne requested the public officials to take necessary decisions without fear, adding that the President, Prime Minister and Finance Ministry are behind them for their defence.
“At this emergency situation, the public officials may not be able to adhere to procurement procedures. They may hesitate to do so thinking that they might be questioned later. This situation was due to abuse of power by few officials in the past, but we always defend the officials who go beyond their limits to help people” he said.
He said that his Ministry has initiated a special programme through banks to help small scale enterprises affected by floods and landslides.
He said that the Ministry will obtain details of affected small scale entrepreneurs in each district by Friday. 
Wickremaratne further noted that a programme to distribute school books and stationary items to enable children to go back to their schools from next week has also been initiated with the support of banks.    
 The Deputy Minister, pointing out that the majority of deaths were caused due to landslides, called on the Geologists to do a comprehensive study, to produce a report to the Government.
 “Most of the recent incidents were related to mud-slides where the upper soil falls. The researchers may update the Government on necessary revisions to existing laws and regulations” he added.
The Deputy Minister observed the inundation of Southern Expressway was a wake-up call to take precautions in this regard in future Expressway constructions. 
He also commended the tri-force personnel for their invaluable service rendered towards relief work.
