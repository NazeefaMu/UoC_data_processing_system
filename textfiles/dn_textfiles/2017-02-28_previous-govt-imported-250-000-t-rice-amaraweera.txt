Previous govt imported 250, 000 T rice: Amaraweera

Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Mahinda Amaraweera said that people who blame the government for importing rice have forgotten that the previous regime imported 250,000 T of rice despite the country attaining self-sufficiency in rice production.
He said this while addressing the gathering after launching development work in the Mamaduwa fisheries village in Vavuniya, under the ministry's 'Wewak Samaga Gamak' programme, recently.
The minster, who admitted that there was a problem regarding the price of rice, to which the government had given special attention, said that the price of fish had remained stable for quite sometime despite the fluctuation of other commodities.
Rice price increase was the work of a 'millers' mafia. Millers hid the paddy stock released by the PMB without milling it, and issued the rice to nearby markets. Nearly 200 black-marketeers who hid rice stocks were taken into custody to institute legal action against them. The long spell of drought was another factor which contributed to the shortage of rice. Price of rice has become the best tool of bankrupt politicians.
The government would never allow the people to starve without their staple food.
The government had insisted rice imports as a contingency plan, and prices in the local markets progressively decreased.
Minister Amaraweera said that the government never postponed local elections intentionally despite allegations made by critics.
The government never feared elections because as it was certain that the SLFP led UPFA would emerge victorious in any election under the able and astute leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena.
The SLFP had arrived at a firm decision that it would team up with small parties which promoted communalism.
