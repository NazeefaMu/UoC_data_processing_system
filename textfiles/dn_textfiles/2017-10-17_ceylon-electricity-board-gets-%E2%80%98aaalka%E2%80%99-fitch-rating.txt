Ceylon Electricity Board gets ‘AAA(lka)’ Fitch rating

Fitch Ratings Lanka has published Ceylon Electricity Board’s (CEB) National Long-Term Rating of ‘AAA(lka)’ with a Stable Outlook. CEB is fully owned by the Sri Lanka sovereign (B+/Stable).
CEB’s rating is equalised with that of the sovereign based on the strong linkages with its parent, in line with Fitch’s Parent and Subsidiary Rating Linkage criteria. The equalisation takes into consideration CEB’s strategic importance to Sri Lanka in ensuring power security and supply of affordable electricity to the public.
