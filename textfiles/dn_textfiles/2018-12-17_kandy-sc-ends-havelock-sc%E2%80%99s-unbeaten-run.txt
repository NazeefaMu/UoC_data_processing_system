Dialog inter-club ‘A’ division rugby league
Kandy SC ends Havelock SC’s unbeaten run

Kandy Sports Club produced a superb performance to outwit Havelock Sports Club and win their sixth Dialog sponsored inter-club first round rugby match with a 31-21 win at Nittawela yesterday.
Kandy SC was in full form scoring their 31 points off 4 goals and a penalty kick at goal against the 21 that came off 3 goals.
Kandy SC controlled the tackle area, denying Havelocks quick possession and fracturing the supply line. They went into the interval with a 21-7 lead. They duly won the first half with the opponents not prepared to roll over.
Havelock SC was left shocked by Kandy SC’s superb ball handling. Havelocks forwards were in the game with some good moves, but Kandy knew how to handle them. Kandy SC players from number one to fifteen showcased in contrasting styles, and a big hand should be given to their no. 8 Buwanika Udangamuwa for three super touch downs.
It was Havelock SC’s first defeat in six games. Havelocks looked to move the ball out of the tackle as often as possible, while Kandy looked for their big men to carry into contact. However, it was the winning team’s intent, physicality and ambition - matched by an accuracy that won the day.
Havelocks showed plenty of character as they fought their way into the game, but ultimately they ran out of time and ideas. They started the game at great pace as they looked to get the ball wide at every opportunity and got around Kandy’s defence on several occasions.
In this all important game Kandy showed their character as they came out with intent and got the start they wanted. What a performance from the linkman Roshan Weeraratne who showed real grit of performance. He controlled the game brilliantly. They were excellent in attack but it was also their defence that impressed as they matched the Park club physically and did not take a step backwards.
All in all there were a good numbers of yellow cards on show.
For Kandy the tries came from Buwanika Udangamuwa (3), Anuruddha Wilawara (1) and the goal kicking came off the boot of Thilina Wijesinghe. For Havelocks the tries came from Sethum Peries, Dushmantha Priyadarshana and Dinuk Amarasinghe and the goal kicking was done by Reza Mubarak.
