Parliament

As it was not handed in time: Speaker:
Adjournment Motion not included in Order Paper
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday, observed that the Adjournment Motion had not been included in the Order Paper yesterday, as the Joint Opposition had handed it over to the Secretary General two hours after the scheduled time.
The Speaker observed that when the Joint Opposition had neglected the time frame, he could not urge the officials to deviate from decisions that had earlier been taken on the same matters.
He made these observations yesterday, when Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group leader Dinesh Gunawardena queried as to why the adjournment motion that was to be moved by the Joint Opposition was not included in the Order Paper.
The Speaker said the Adjournment Motion had been handed over to the Secretary General at 2.25 pm on Wednesday, whereas the deadline was 12 noon the same day.
He said that due to this reason, the same was not included in the Order Paper.
At this stage MP Gunawardena said that the motion was on the strikes that was to be staged today and it was of great importance. "At least give us a chance to move the motion," MP Gunawardena said.
"The government could answer the motion some other day." "But there was no such tradition," the Speaker said. "So it cannot be allowed."
PHU leader questions as to why a principal accused of fraud was appointed to Richmond College
Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Leader Udaya Gammanpila, yesterday in Parliament questioned the rationale of appointing a principal accused of an alleged financial fraud to Richmond College, Galle.
Gammanpila pointed out that Sampath Weragoda, the Principal of Richmond College in Galle, was given a charge sheet over an alleged financial fraud during the period he functioned as the Principal of Prince of Wales College, Moratuwa.
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam responding to the question, said the appointment was made on a temporary basis as there was a shortage of principals in the country. He said the disciplinary inquiry and the inquiry conducted by the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption against the Principal had not concluded yet.
He pointed out that three salary increments of the said Principal had been deducted and that he had been thoroughly reprimanded as per the recommendation of the Public Service Commission after finding him guilty of several charges.
Gammanpila observed that this appointment was unfair to other Principals and that it encouraged bribery and corruption.
Bandula raises arguments on validity of currency notes
UPFA MP Bandula Gunawardena yesterday in Parliament, raised fresh arguments on the validity of currency notes signed by former Central Bank Governor Arjun Mahendran in the wake of a Court ruling on the Parliamentary seat of MP Geetha Kumarasinghe.
“Arjun Mahendran is a Singaporean citizen. A Singaporean citizen could not obtain a dual citizenship. Despite that, Mahendran was appointed the CB Governor and currency notes were issued under his signature. If currency notes signed by a non-Sri Lankan citizen are valid, how can MP Kumarasinghe, who even withdrew her dual citizenship, be disqualified from holding a Parliamentary seat? Mahendran had not even taken oaths as per the Constitution when he assumed duties,” Gunawardena said.
The MP also tabled a Rs 100 currency note signed by the former CB Governor, observing that the recent Court ruling posed a serious challenge to the validity of those currency notes.
