Sampath Bank partners  Colombo Scouts Camporee

Sampath Bank joined hands with the 53rd Colombo Scouts Camporee held from August 10-14, at the Vihara Maha Devi Park in Colombo as the official Banking Partner.
The partnership with this year’s camp is a result of Sampath Bank’s steadfast commitment to support socially responsible initiatives, especially those that are aimed at nurturing the next generation of Sri Lankans.
“At Sampath Bank, we have always been firm believers in the potential of the nation’s youth to drive positive change. Being actively involved in programs aimed at shaping them into responsible citizens of the future, we are honoured to extend our support to the 53rd Colombo Scouts Camporee,” said Nanda Fernando, Managing Director, Sampath Bank, who has been a District Commissioner and Camporee Organizing Commissioner. “Scouting has had a profound and lasting impact on my life. Encouraged by the enthusiasm with which these young boys and girls took part in the camporee, I look forward to seeing them being shaped into leaders of the future.”
Fernando personally handed over the Bank’s sponsorship cheque to Amil Abeysundara, Organizing Commissioner of this year’s Camporee. He commended the Organizing Commissioner and the committee on behalf of the Bank for organizing this invaluable event that brought together the fellowship of 6,000 Scouts, Cub Scouts and Singithi Scouts and undoubtedly helped build good citizens of tomorrow.
Going beyond offering financial support, Sampath Bank also organized a series of competitions and other engaging activities around banking and finance to help them sharpen their leadership and entrepreneurial skills.
Leaders of the 60 Troops that took part in the camporee were given a token sum in the game’s currencies and were tasked with working with their teams on raising money by organizing games and competing with one another.Offering them a glimpse of the world of banking and business, the activities were aimed at developing the youngsters’ entrepreneurial spirit and building their decisions making, strategic thinking and financial skills.The troops were excited about the fresh dimension that the game brought to the camp and actively took part in it with great enthusiasm. The winners of the top ten places walked away with a host of breathtaking prizes from the Bank.
Sampath Bank also conducted a raffle draw for the participants and gave away Scooties, Drones, and Mountain Bikes.
