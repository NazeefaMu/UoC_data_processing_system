SLFP May Day rally only in Kandy

Action against MP absentees :
The SLFP May Day rally will only be held in Kandy. Those who wish to attend other rallies, can do so, UPFA General Secretary Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said yesterday.
He said the SLFP Central Committee will take action against SLFP MPs who don’t attend the Kandy rally.
“There will be no personal vendetta against anyone. It is the Central Committee of the SLFP that makes all decisions,” he said.
Addressing the media at the SLFP Headquarters, Amaraweera said they will hold the largest May Day rally under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena in Getambe.
“We have managed to attract more and more crowds after the poor performance of the first May Day rally in Galle,” he said.
