Telugu version of Hrithik Roshan film titled ‘Balam’

The Telugu dubbed version of Bollywood film, ‘Kaabil’ finally gets a title. Directed by Sanjay Gupta and produced by actor-turned-producer Rakesh Roshan, the film stars the latter’s son and Bollywood superstar Hrithik Roshan and Yami Gautam as the main leads.
Earlier, Catch had reported that the Telugu dubbed version of the Hrithik Roshan-starrer is slated to be released in Telangana along with it’s original version on 26 January.
And now, the makers had decided to name the film ‘Balam’, which means strength in English. The producers have released a statement to the media announcing details of the release of the first look and trailer of ‘Balam’.
The statement was, “Hrithik Roshan and Rakesh Roshan are back together for the new action thriller ‘Kaabil’. This movie will have a big release in Telugu markets and the Telugu version has been titled ‘Balam’. The first look and trailer of Balam will be out for Diwali.”
Hrithik Roshan has a huge fan base in Telangana, especially in Andhra Pradesh, where the actor’s last film, ‘Mohenjo Daro’ - a Box Office disaster - did reasonable business. The ‘Kaho Na Pyar Hai’ star’s earlier blockbusters – ‘Koi Mil Gaya’ and the ‘Krrish’ series - too released in Telugu and did wonders at the Box Office.
