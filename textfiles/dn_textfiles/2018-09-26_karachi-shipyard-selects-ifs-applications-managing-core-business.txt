Karachi Shipyard and Engineering Works (KS&EW) to implement IFS Applications for ship and submarine construction projects, manufacturing, supply chain, finance, HR, maintenance and engineering works
IFS, the global enterprise applications company, has announced that Karachi Shipyard and Engineering Works Ltd.(KS & EW) would deploy IFS Applications 10 as its ERPbackbone for managing core business processes such as project management, manufacturing, maintenance and engineering.
As Pakistan’s largest shipyard and oldest heavy engineering establishment, KS & EW plays an important role in the broadening of the country’s industrial base.

“We are impressed with the capabilities of IFS Applications and are delighted to work with a global ERP provider which has successful track record in supporting companies particularly in shipbuilding,” expressed Rear Admiral Ather Saleem SI(M); Managing Director KS&EW. He added that the IFS will endeavor to accomplish the project well in time and pave the way to bring improvement and enhance efficiency in the yard’s processes and working methodologies.
