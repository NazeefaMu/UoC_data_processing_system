KPMG to demystify principles of Value Added Tax in Sri Lanka

The Value Added Tax system and legislature has undergone multiple amendments and continues to evolve over the years. However the intricacies of VAT and the finer points of its application are a complex concept for many.
KPMG will be conducting an interactive and in-depth seminar to unravel complexities on the application of VAT, the Statutory rules and Rulings issued and the administrative practices adopted by tax officers.
The workshop will be held at the Movenpick Hotel, on January 16, 2018. Hasna Hassan, Director – Tax & Regulatory, KPMG will be conducting the seminar.
Hasna Hassan is an Associate Member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka as well as the Certified Practicing Accountants (CPA) of Australia. She has been with KPMG for over 15 years and has in-depth knowledge on the VAT related issues affecting taxpayers.
