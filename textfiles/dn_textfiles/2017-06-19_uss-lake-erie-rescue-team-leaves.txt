USS Lake Erie rescue team leaves

A ceremony to bid farewell to the crew of USS Lake Erie, which provided relief assistance to the people affected by the recent weather disaster, was held at the Colombo Harbour complex last Friday.
The ceremony was held with the patronage of Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake, Ambassador of the United States of America to Sri Lanka Atul Keshap and Navy Commander Vice Admiral Ravindra Wijegunawardena.
300 US soldiers arrived in the country by this vessel to provide relief assistance to the people affected by the recent inclement weather in the country. Captain of USS Erie Darren McPherson welcomed the Sri Lankan guests including Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake. Later Captain McPherson gave a presentation about their operations in the country.
Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake said the assistance extended by the United States of America to help the weather affected people could not be forgotten.
He said that the cooperation extended by powerful nations including the United States to Sri Lanka in this hour of need is extremely admirable.
The minister also pointed out that such a huge assistance was given to Sri Lanka as the International community has placed such a reliance on President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
American Ambassador in Sri Lanka Atul Keshap thanked the solders of Vessel US Erie for their commitment during the stay in Sri Lanka.
The US rescue team engaged in various activities in several areas in the Southern Province during the last two weeks to bring the devastated lives of the people to normalcy. Among such operations are cleaning of damaged schools, purifying contaminated drinking water wells and repairing irrigation tank bunds. USAID spent nearly Rs.350 million to provide relief to the affected.
Funds granted by USAID have been used to provide water filters, emergency kits, house repairing kits and essential health services to prevent various infectious diseases that could spread after floods.
