Electrified fences around elephant threatened villages: Special committees for maintenance

In an effort to protect people in rural areas from the wild elephant menace, Sustainable Development and Wildlife Ministry will erect electrified fences around threatened villages and set up special committees for their maintenance by providing financial assistance, Sustainable Development and Wildlife Deputy Minister Sumedha G Jayasena said.
She disclosed this after activating the operation of an electrified fence for the protection of the Maradankadawala Ranaviru village recently.
Jayasena said the government while protecting country’s wildlife would do its utmost to protect people from the threat of wild animals. Steps have been taken to ensure a five-fold increase in the compensation offered to people falling victim to rampaging wild elephants.
Deputy Minister Jayasena said the Wildlife Department has meagre resources, including human capital. There is a dearth of wildlife officials. Although Cabinet approval had been granted for an intake of officers and minor staff, they had failed to fill the vacancies.
She said the Civil Security Service was entrusted with the task of maintaining electrified fences. It was ill-equipped to carry out the job.
The ministry had devised a novel plan for the maintenance of the fences by setting up welfare clubs at rural level and pay their members a daily allowance of Rs. 750 hitherto given to Civil Security personnel engaged in the job.
