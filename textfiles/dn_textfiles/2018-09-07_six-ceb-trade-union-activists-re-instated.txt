Six CEB trade union activists re-instated

The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) yesterday informed the Supreme Court that authorities have taken a decision to re-instate six employees attached to the CEB Joint Trade Union Alliance.
The six petitioners had filed a Fundamental Rights petition in the Supreme Court challenging CEB's decision to interdict them over an allegation that they organized a protest campaign against authorities on January 17, 2018.
When the matter came up before a three-judge-bench headed by Justice Nalin Perera, all parties to the petition agreed for a settlement following the CEB's positive response to re-instate the six trade union activists. (LS)
