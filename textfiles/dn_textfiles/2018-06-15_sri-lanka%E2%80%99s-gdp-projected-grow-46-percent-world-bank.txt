Sri Lanka’s GDP  projected to grow  4.6 percent - WORLD BANK

After reaching 3.1 percent in both 2017 and 2018, the Wolrd Bank says that the global growth is expected to decelerate over the next two years as global slack dissipates, major central banks remove policy accommodation, and the recovery in commodity exporters matures. Amid moderating international trade and tightening global financing conditions, growth in emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) is projected to plateau, reaching 4.7 percent in 2019 and 2020, up from 4.5 percent in 2018.
Global growth is expected to edge down over the next two years, as global slack dissipates, trade and investment moderate, and financing conditions tighten. In EMDEs, growth in commodity importers is expected to remain robust, while the rebound in commodity exporters is projected to mature.
Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside, including the possibility of disorderly financial market movements, escalating trade protectionism, heightened policy uncertainty, and rising geopolitical tensions. EMDE policymakers need to rebuild monetary and fiscal policy buffers and boost potential growth by promoting competitiveness, adaptability to technological change, and trade openness.
Growth in South Asia is projected to accelerate to 6.9 percent in 2018 from 6.6 in 2017, mainly reflecting fading disruptions to economic activity in India. Growth in the rest of the region is expected to stabilize at 5.6 percent in 2018.
Over the forecast horizon, growth is projected to reach 7.1 percent on average in 2019-20, reflecting broad-based strengthening across the region.
Despite the possibility of upside surprises to global activity, risks to the outlook are still tilted to the downside. Downside risks relate to both domestic factors, especially policy slippages amid sizable fiscal adjustment needs, and external factors, including the possibility of a faster-than-expected tightening of global financial conditions and increased global trade tensions.
Growth in South Asia slowed but remained strong at an estimated 6.6 percent in 2017. Growth in the region has improved markedly since mid-2017 and continued to firm in early 2018, reflecting improved consumer and investor sentiment, higher investment, and firming exports (e.g., Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka).
Domestic Demand
Growth in South Asia continues to rely on domestic demand, with firming but modest support from export growth (e.g., Bangladesh, India). Import growth is accelerating amid strengthening domestic demand, while higher energy prices are also contributing to a further deterioration of trade and current account balances (e.g., India, Nepal, and Pakistan).
Domestic and external financial market conditions have been generally supportive, but sovereign bond spreads have increased in 2018 amid rising inflation expectations and monetary policy normalization in advanced economies.
Monetary policy in the region has remained broadly accommodative and supported fast credit growth (e.g., Bangladesh, Pakistan); however, the State Bank of Pakistan recently hiked its policy rate to reduce growing external pressures.
Inflation has been increasing in the region recently, and is close to or above targets in some countries (e.g., India, Sri Lanka).
In many countries, budget deficits continue to be sizable or have widened further in 2018 reflecting both weaker-than-expected revenues and expansionary policies (e.g., Bangladesh, Nepal) with fiscal policies being generally pro-cyclical in the region.
India’s GDP growth bottomed out in the middle of 2017 after slowing for five consecutive quarters, and has since improved significantly, with momentum carrying over into 2018 on the back of a recovery in investment.
Although investment growth was still moderately lower in 2017 than in 2016, high-frequency indicators suggest that it accelerated into 2018. The temporary disruptions caused by the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax dissipated by mid-2017, and manufacturing output and industrial production have continued to firm since then.
Growth in the region excluding India has been mixed in the first half of 2018. In Bangladesh, growth has rebounded following the natural disasters of mid-2017 (e.g., severe floods and landslides), and activity has remained strong and broad-based in 2018.
In Sri Lanka, activity in 2018 has been supported by a recovery in investment, especially in the construction and agriculture sectors, and related activities, following a slowdown in 2017 driven in part by adverse weather conditions.
Pakistan’s GDP growth rose in FY2017/18, supported by infrastructure projects funded by the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), improvements in energy supply, and persistent private consumption growth.
In Bhutan, growth has been moderating, partly owing to delays in hydropower projects. However, growth is still strong, at 5.8 percent in FY2017/18.
In Afghanistan, the recovery continues to be disrupted by security challenges and political uncertainty.
Growth in South Asia is forecast to pick up to 6.9 percent in 2018, mainly reflecting the fading effects of temporary factors that weakened activity in India.
The forecast is broadly unchanged from January 2018. Domestic demand is the key driver of growth in the region, although firming exports should provide additional support in 2018.
The baseline scenario assumes a moderating recovery in global trade, higher commodity prices, and gradually tightening global financing conditions.
Forecast for 2018
Growth in India is projected to accelerate to 7.3 percent in FY2018/19 and 7.5 percent on average in 2019-20, reflecting robust private consumption and firming investment, broadly in line with January projections. In the rest of the region, growth will remain stable at about 5.6 percent in 2018 and throughout the forecast horizon as ongoing recoveries in Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka are offset by slower growth in Afghanistan, Bhutan, and Maldives.
In Pakistan, GDP growth is estimated to rise to 5.8 percent in FY2017/18, before moderating to 5.0 percent in FY2018/19, reflecting tighter policies to improve macroeconomic stability. In Bangladesh, growth is expected to recover from the effects of natural disasters in FY2017/18 and reach 6.7 percent in FY2018/19, supported in part by robust export growth and remittances.
Sri Lanka’s GDP is projected to grow 4.6 percent on average over the period 2018-20, reflecting a recovery from the effects of last year’s natural disasters on agriculture, as well as robust consumption and investment growth.
After the strong rebound in FY2016/17 from the effects of the devastating earthquakes in FY2015/16, Nepal’s GDP growth is forecast to moderate to 4.6 percent in FY 2017/18 and average 4.3 percent in 2019-20.
In Bhutan and Maldives, growth will continue to benefit from construction and services, especially tourism, and average 7.4 and 5 percent respectively over the forecast horizon.
In Afghanistan, growth will remain subdued due to continued security challenges and political uncertainty.
Risks
Risks to South Asia outlook are tilted to the downside, although upside surprises to global growth remain a possibility in the short-term.
These include domestic policy slippages, renewed security challenges, and natural disasters. The outlook could also be adversely affected by external shocks such as an abrupt tightening of global financial conditions and escalating trade protectionism, even though the region is relatively less open to trade.
Since South Asia is net oil importer, a higher-than-expected rise in oil prices might amplify macroeconomic vulnerabilities and weigh on economic activity.
In a number of countries, a further deterioration in fiscal balances (e.g., India, Maldives, Pakistan, Sri Lanka), a continued build-up of debt, and widening current account deficits (e.g., Pakistan), present significant vulnerabilities to a tightening of domestic or external financing conditions (Basu, Eichengreen, and Gupta 2015).
Furthermore, a setback in the implementation of reforms to resolve weakening corporate and financial sector balance sheets could hold back the investment recovery currently underway and dampen credit growth in the region.
An increase in political uncertainty (e.g., Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka) and further deterioration in the security environment in some countries (e.g., Afghanistan) might dampen confidence and set back growth.
In recent years, the number of people and geographical areas affected by natural disasters such as drought, floods, and earthquakes has risen in the region.
A rise in the prevalence of natural disasters, including those caused by climate change, could disrupt infrastructure, agricultural output, and economic activity in general (e.g., Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka).
