With absorption of students to KDU: SAITM will stand abolished by law: Dr. Rajapakshe
The Medical Faculty of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM), will stand abolished by law after absorbing its students to the Kotelawala Defence University (KDU), Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Dr Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said.
The Minister moving the General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University (Special Provisions) Bill for debate in Parliament yesterday, said a special Clause to revoke the degree awarding status of the SAITM Medical Faculty and thereby to stand it abolished would be included in the Bill at its Third Reading.
As per the Bill, the students registered with the SAITM in between September 15, 2009 and May 15, 2017, would be absorbed to the Kotelawala University to follow the MBBS Degree Programme if they had obtained basic qualifications. “Basic qualifications” mean 3 ‘S’ passes for Chemistry, Physics and Biology at the Advanced Level Examination or an equivalent foreign qualification including equivalent qualifications of students who have offered the subjects Chemistry, Biology and Mathematics.
The absorbed students would be awarded the MBBS Degree (KDU) if they successfully complete the study programme. The Minister said each SAITM student absorbed to the KDU would be assessed and that clinical training had been made mandatory for all of them, including those who have already passed out from the SAITM.
The Minister, observing that the Bill was presented in agreement with all stakeholders, regretted that a handful of students were protesting near the Parliament roundabout yesterday and the day before. “If any party was against the Bill, they have seven days to challenge the Bill in the Supreme Court. No petition was filed against so far and that was the reason we could take it for debate very soon. The SAITM students must be meted out with justice as they have nothing to do with its erroneous start and everybody was in agreement with this solution,” he added.
The Minister said the passage of legislation to absorb SAITM students to the KDU would amicably settle a long standing burning issue that hampered the education of medical students for 10 months, triggering incessant protests, causing road blocks and disturbance to the day-to-day life of the people. He pointed out the quality of university education had deteriorated drastically due the issue.
He revealed that Agencies that send students abroad for medical education, have mushroomed in the recent years, while they receive a commission of Rs 500,000 for each student they send to Medical Colleges in countries such as India, Bangladesh and Nepal. “This commission is Rs 1 million for a student they send to European countries. These Agencies were pumping money to some of those student protests and unrest as they have benefitted by the protraction of the issue,” he added.
Parliamentarians humiliate themselves by speaking of 118 list:Kiriella
Parliamentarians humiliate themselves by repeatedly speaking of a list of 118 names which nobody was sure of existing, Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
He made this comment in response to UPFA MP Dullas Alahapperuma, who called on Deputy Speaker Ananada Kumarasiri to reveal the names of MPs who had obtained cheques, property or any other benefit from Arjun Aloysius and put an end to the matter.
The MP made this request in reference to the speech of Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake in Parliament on Tuesday, where he alleged that certain MPs had obtained various other perks from Aloysius in addition to money.
Minister Kiriella pointed out that Speaker Karu Jayasuriya on many occasions, had refuted the existence of such a list. “The story of this alleged list of 118 MPs started by MP Dayasiri Jayasekara. But the Speaker clearly said that there was no such thing. In this backdrop, it is inappropriate to take the same matter into discussion during Parliamentary sittings. By doing so, we are defaming ourselves as well as the House. It is true that Ranjan Ramanayake made some claims regarding it. But why do you need to bring it up the same today?” he questioned.
The Deputy Speaker said that he would bring Alahapperuma’s concerns to the attention of the Speaker.
Postal fees increased by Gazette Notification
The Government yesterday in Parliament, presented a Gazette Notification to increase postage fees.
According to the notification issued by the Postal Services and Muslim Religious Affairs Minister, the minimum postage fee has been increased to Rs 15 from Rs 5. Postage fee for each 20g has been increased by Rs 15.
The Gazette Notification says that this fee would apply up to 100g.
Moreover, the postage fee for mail which weighs from 100g to 250g had also been increased. Accordingly, the postage fee for each 50g has been increased by Rs.10 for mail which weighs between 100g to 250g.
The price of a postcard had also been increased up to Rs 30 from Rs 20.
JVP wants educational qualifications of SAITM students tabled
JVP MP Dr Nalinda Jayatissa said 33 students from among those in the first four batches of SAITM have obtained less than 2 C passes and 1 S pass at the GCE AL Examination.
Joining the debate on General Sir John Kotelawala Defense University (Special Provisions) Bill to absorb the SAITM Medical students to the KDU, he said the University Grants Commission (UGC) provided the educational qualifications of students registered with the SAITM Medical Faculty to COPE upon the request of the committee.
He said as per the given document, three out of 16 local students in the first batch, 13 out of 37 local students in the second batch, three out of 14 local students in the third batch and 14 out of 55 local students in the fourth batch have obtained less than 2 Cs and 1 S at the AL Exam.
Stating that setting 3 ‘S’ passes as the minimum qualification was not fair.
He requested that it be made at least 2 Cs and one S.
He said this was also the request of the Deans of eight State Medical Faculties.
Observing that even the students who obtain higher Z-scores as 1.8 or 1.9, miss the opportunity to enter State Medical Faculties, he said two students whose Z-scores were merely 0.058 and 0.0744 were also among the students registered with the SAITM Medial Faculty.
He requested the Government to table in Parliament the basic educational qualifications of SAITM students to be absorbed to the KDU.
Govt. presents Apartment Ownership (Special Provisions) Bill to Parliament
The Government presented the Apartment Ownership (Special Provisions) Bill in Parliament yesterday, to facilitate the registration and disposition of certain Condominium properties owned by the State or by a State agency.
The provisions of the Bill would be in operation for a period of five years. The Bill was presented for First Reading by the Chief Government Whip and Minister Gayantha Karunathilake.
The Bill removes the existing impediments to vesting the title of the condominium houses constructed by the National Housing Development Authority, Urban Development Authority, Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation and other State institutions prior to December 31, 2009.
Under the Bill, the properties would be registered notwithstanding the non-availability of the building plans approved by the Local Authority and the non-availability of the Certificate of Conformity issued by the local authority.
The Bill gives legal approval for condominium houses constructed before 2009, by state institutions even if the floor areas have been extended by the owners in violation of regulations.
Debate on private education: Grero, Bimal don’t see eye to eye
A heated argument between JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake and Higher Education State Minister Mohan Lal Grero erupted during the course of the debate on private education in Parliament yesterday.
JVP MP Rathnayake said it was inappropriate for State Minister Grero to take part in a debate on private education as he is a stakeholder in the private education business who owns an international school. He made this remark at Grero when the latter stood up to reply the concerns raised by Rathnayake.
“There is a clear conflict of interest in State Minister Grero participating in this debate. Do not use your position for the sake of your business. You are no different to Arjun Aloysius. It is a shame that a person who finds his livelihood by selling education participates in this debate. You came to the JVP office once, seeking our support to save the Lyceum school which belonged to you. You have no moral right to speak in this debate,” charged MP Rathnayake.
However, Grero said that he simply wanted to make a clarification as the State Minister.
“You should not sling mud at me when I attempted to make a clarification in my capacity as a state minister. I remember that you were one of my students sometime back. You should be ashamed of what you said,” Grero replied.
Dr. Rajapakshe reaffirms lecturer solicited sexual favours
Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, reaffirming that a Lecturer at the South Eastern University had solicited sexual favours from female students, said he had referred the matter to the Bribery Commission for investigation.
He made this observation in Parliament yesterday, when Deputy Minister H. M. M. Harees questioned whether the Minister had evidence to prove his claim in the House at a previous day. Deputy Minister Harees said parents, students and lecturers of the Oluwil University had been inconvenienced due to this statement as it was highlighted in the media.
“I am not speaking without evidence. The female student came along with her parents and submitted an affidavit to the University Grants Commission (UGC), detailing sexual harassment claims. The Lecturer had threatened that he would break the bones of the girl unless she agreed to provide him sexual pleasure. The Lecturer in question, had demanded sexual favours in return for good grades and I specifically named the Lecturer in question in my previous speech in Parliament,” he said.
He added that the UGC had initiated an investigation concerning the allegation and also forwarded the case to the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption.
“The plight of the Oluwil University cannot be hidden. There was no discipline in it and was completely out of control. Vice Chancellor Prof. M. Najim who was appointed three years ago, was trying hard to bring the University to proper standards. Yet, a few lecturers together with the Registrar were trying to sabotage his attempt,” Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe added.
