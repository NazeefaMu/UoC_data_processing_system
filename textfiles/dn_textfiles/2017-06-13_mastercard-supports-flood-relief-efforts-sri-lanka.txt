Mastercard supports  flood relief efforts in Sri Lanka

Mastercard partners with United Nations World Food Programme

Lending its support to the innumerable Sri Lankans affected by torrential rains, Mastercard announced that it has partnered with the United Nations World Food Programme's (WFP) flood relief efforts in Sri Lanka.
Silvio Barzi, Independent Director, Mastercard Inc., handed over a donation from the company to WFP Deputy Country Director, Nguyen Duc Hoang recently.
The WFP is supporting the flood relief efforts with the Government of Sri Lanka by initially providing 22.5 million tonnes (mt) of dhal to supplement the hot-meals of the 75,000 affected population, with the support of Mastercard funding.
“While we are pained by the scale of devastation by the floods around the island, we are truly inspired by the resilience and unity of Sri Lankans who have come together in support of one another,” said Silvio Barzi.
“As a company that has been a part of this community for around 30 years, we are committed to providing support and assistance to its people during this difficult time. As a first step, we have contributed funds to the World Food Programme's ongoing relief efforts and will continue to do what we can to help the country recover from this natural calamity.”
Mastercard and WFP have been working together for over five years towards a single mission: to end hunger. Believing that technology has the power to unlock innovation in food assistance delivery, the partnership has worked to bring new ideas to WFP programs and raise important funds.
In addition to leveraging its technology, Mastercard has enabled employees around the world to undertake temporary assignments at WFP offices in order to take a hands-on approach to the partnership.
In one example, a cost-benefit analysis of the School Meals Programme conducted by WFP in Sri Lanka with the support of Mastercard found that each dollar invested to feed a schoolchild produces a return on investment of US$8.32 throughout the child's life.
Furthermore, with the creation of a donation platform that integrates charitable giving into everyday life, Mastercard and its bank and retail partners have helped raise funds to provide over 17 million school meals to vulnerable children around the world.
