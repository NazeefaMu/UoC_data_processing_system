Poems

 WAVES OF THE SEA
Why is the sea so upset and tense Without enjoying repose in the vast bed of space? Her life is restless and rises with gigantic hands of waves And in utter fatigue her toiled hands fall for a while The sea Queen donning the royal crown of blue water Leads a busy life extending her good governance to the citizens of The sea kingdom with devotion and dedication The living creatures in this sea bottom and surface Enjoy swimming contest all the days and nights The roaming boats and ships demonstrate rocking of the cradle waves The sight seers welcome the flourishing happy waves Dashing towards the sea shore Desiring to touch the feet of anxious humans I wonder how the eternal waves resemble the non stopping workers In the productive fields! I feel surprised to watch sea waves as the nature’s gifts That were bestowed by the Almighty God.

Old sins and long shadows
Past in time carries Reawake memories Tensed instances Reminding old differences Wounding conscience hurt Bleeding spirit curt Agitated selves Old cruel sins tell Brings its long shadows Tears swell fear goes Tension dispeled evident Agitating torment Seeks all comforts ensign Long shadows remind How sinfull this told Repentant souls Make amends never fall when shadows meet Compromise will greet

SHADOWS FROM THE PAST
Flashing back in my septuagenarian mind Were images of my happy childhood days. Holding our hands we stood at the beach Enjoying the waters washing our feet Golden sand was tickling our soles Salty winds were touching our lips. No boulders were there to mark the sea On shivering sands we waded free. Collected sea shells abundant on our shores Built sand castles that waves carried by force The salty waters crowned with white foams Would dash on the beach crowning us all. We hardly saw a ship for they were rare, For hours at a ‘lighted’ ship we would stare We’d watch the sun dive before sinking into the sea Homeward we marched so cheerful and glee. Everything is changed, old we are too Only in my dreams I recall these scenes.
Lalitha Somathilaka
I Am Dying
I am the Earth. Mother of them all. I’m getting hotter and hotter each day, I just want to lay and rest. Let me rest, I’m dying. My babies are dying, The ice is melting, The sun is burning my skin, My babies, My life. You cruel people, You choke me to death. Your chemicals are killing What I have tried to raise. How is life supposed to carry on... If my people destroy what Makes us live And breathe? My poor trees! Just think and feel how they feel. Why are you putting rubbish on my skin? STOP... OH, STOP it now! You’re giving me a disease, And it’s burning to my core. Get in my mind, come on, Look deep down and find My heart is slowly stopping. You’re killing me, You murderer.
Marie Negus
A Prayer in Time Of War
Thou, whose deep ways are in the sea, Whose footsteps are not known, To-night a world that turned from Thee Is waiting -- at Thy Throne. The towering Babels that we raised Where scoffing sophists brawl, The little Antichrists we praised -- The night is on them all. The fool hath said . . . The fool hath said . .. And we, who deemed him wise, We who believed that Thou wast dead, How should we seek Thine eyes? How should we seek to Thee for power Who scorned Thee yesterday? How should we kneel, in this dread hour? Lord, teach us how to pray! Grant us the single heart, once more, That mocks no sacred thing, The Sword of Truth our fathers wore When Thou wast Lord and King. Let darkness unto darkness tell Our deep unspoken prayer, For, while our souls in darkness dwell, We know that Thou art there.
Alfred Noyes
If I Thought
If I thought for just one moment that this would be my last breath, I’d tell you I’ll love you forever, even beyond death. If I thought for just one moment that your face would be the last I’d see, I’d take a million pictures and save them just for me. If I thought for just one moment that your voice would be the last I’d hear, I’d listen attentively and promise not to shed a tear. If I thought for just one moment that your touch would be the last I’d feel, I’d embrace you and know that this has all been real. If I thought for just one moment that my heart would beat its last beat, I’d thank the Lord for allowing us to meet.
