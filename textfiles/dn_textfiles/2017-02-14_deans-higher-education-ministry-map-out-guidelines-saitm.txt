Deans, Higher Education Ministry map out guidelines for SAITM

The Deans of eight state medical faculties and the Higher Education Ministry yesterday agreed to submit several proposals to the administration of the private medical college in Malabe including  suspending admission of students temporarily, further clinical training in several medical disciplines for those who have passed the final MBBS exam and pass a licensing exam conducted by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC).
During the next six months, the Higher Education and Highways Ministry, University Grants Commission (UGC), the SLMC and other stake holders will jointly develop an operational procedure applicable to non-state medical education.
Following a discussion yesterday, the two parties agreed to propose to the administration of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) to suspend admission of medical students for six months until the periodic review of the medical degree programme is conducted by the Higher Education Ministry.
They had also decided to propose that SAITM students who have passed the final MBBS examination must undergo a further period of clinical training in surgery, medicine, gynaecology and obstetrics and paediatrics, one month each, in a state hospital and at the end of the period of clinical training, the student must pass a licensing examination conducted by the SLMC.
The Deans had also agreed to discuss the proposals at the SLMC.
When contacted, Higher Education and Highways Ministry Secretary D.C.Dissanayake said the above were only proposals and will be adopted if both the SLMC and the SAITM agree to them.
Questioned whether the SLMC will register SAITM students who have passed the MBBS examination as medical practitioners in accordance with the court ruling, Dissanayake said it was up to the SLMC to decide.
The Court of Appeal which heard the writ petition filed by a SAITM MBBS graduate recently determined that SAITM is empowered to grant MBBS degrees and the petitioner has legal rights to register at the SLMC as a medical practitioner in accordance with the Medical Ordinance.
Dissanayake yesterday said these issues will be ironed out during further discussions in the future.
Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella, State Minister Mohan Lal Grero, Secretary D.C.Dissanayake, UGC chairman Prof. Mohan de Silva and UGC Vice Chairman Prof. P.M. Guneratne participated in the discussions with the Deans of eight state medical faculties yesterday.
