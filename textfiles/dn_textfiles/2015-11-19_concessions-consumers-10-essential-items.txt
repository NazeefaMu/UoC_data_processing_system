Concessions to consumers on 10 essential items

Ten essential commodities will be given to the people at concessionary prices by the 2016 budget, which is the second budget of
the government formed under the leadership of Maithripala Sirisena, Special Assignments Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama said.
Addressing the media at the SLFP Headquarters in Colombo yesterday he said that the main objective is protecting the living standards of needy people. The people will be offered a 'relief package' to safeguard their living standards and consuming patterns.
The budget deficit was over Rs. 1450 billion last year. It is expected to be reduced to 3.2 percent of the GDP by 2020. It is 6.8 in 2015. In 2016, it is expected to be brought down to 6.1 percent.
According to Dr. Amunugama, there are 20 or 30 different taxes that exist now and these taxes will be simplified by the 2016 budget. Those who stand bellow the tax line will not be subjected to direct taxes except indirect taxes. This means those who do not pay taxes at present will not pay tax in the future.
Dr. Amunugama pointed out that Sri Lanka has established a better International relationship and smooth coordination which will be benefit the country's exporters. Earlier there was a contradiction in the Sri Lankan foreign policy where we opposed the US politically while having exported 70 percent of our products to the US. Our paddy production is more than the requirement and now we have post harvest issues which are something connected to prosperity.
