A strange revelation

Director General of the Bribery Commission Sarath Jayamanne PC has made a strange revelation at the eleventh hour, as it were. He says that the Bribery Act and the Assets and Liabilities law , in their present form, lacked teeth for the Commission to go on an all out offensive to tackle bribery and corruption. Speaking to the Daily News, he said that although the 19th Amendment enabled the Commission to act on its own volition, without waiting for complaints, they were hamstrung for want of sufficient muscle power in terms of a strong Bribery Act and also by way of manpower and infrastructure. He says the Act, has not been changed for 21 years. Although the 19th Amendment is there, it has been rendered ineffective due to existing legal barriers and lack of infrastructure. He went onto state that in other countries there were specialized intelligence units operating all over the country and their anti graft bodies were filtered with information provided by those intelligence officers. “We do not have such a system here. If we are to initiate investigations on our own we need witnesses and evidence”. He also said the Commission was not empowered to investigate into money laundering although this is a serious offense.
So, now we have the Head of the country’s premier bribery investigating body claiming that it’s hands are tied due to the archaic anti- graft legislation in the statute books. Why, pray, was no action taken to remedy this situation, at the outset, when the 19th Amendment was passed, over two years ago? Surely the Attorney General’s Department should have picked on this anomaly? Was this glaring omission not pointed out to the former Justice Minister who burnt the midnight oil to get the 19th amendment into shape? So, now, according to the DG's own admission, things are still in abeyance because nobody thought it fit to ascertain if the Bribery Act needed to be amended to go hand in hand with the 19th Amendment. It is only now that it has dawned on the DG that the Act needs amending, after taking over his new duties over one year ago.
True, the role of the Bribery Commission has got somewhat diluted with the advent of investigation bodies such as the FCID, but even in the best of times, the BC, it has to be said, had been dawdling. This is in contrast to the days of Ian Wickramanayake, and to a lesser extent, Nelum Gamage, where the Bribery Commission, admittedly, was more dynamic and result oriented, even with the archaic Bribery Act to contend with. The BC was always in the news for netting in high profile figures, though it could be argued that these were mostly political vendettas. The DG also says that they have succeeded in clearing the heavy backlog of case files to a great extent amidst limited resources. He said they have brought down the number of pending cases from 10,000 to 4,050 during the last two years. The Commission filed 24 cases in the magistrate's court and 26 cases in the high court this year, he says.
But, apart from the successful prosecution of a lady school principal, some police constables and Grama Sevakas, the public have yet to witness the arraignment of a big time crook. Or is it the DG’s case that they are helpless to apprehend those who have amassed illegal assets, due to the inadequacies in the Assets and Liabilities law and that only those falling within the scope of the Bribery Act, in its present form, such as school principals and police constables are fair game? Whatever happened to all the bribery cases against the Rajapaksa acolytes? What became of the case of a former deputy minister in the Rajapaksa government, who pleaded that he was stung by a polanga, when summoned by the Bribery Commission (during the time of the former regime) to answer how he acquired assets to the value of Rs. 40 million. True, this case is still being heard and the suspect told to appear and reappear in court for what seems to be an interminable length of time.
Be that as it may, the Bribery Commission should play a more dynamic role and go after the big fish, now that it does not a need a complaint to act. It should move for the necessary amendments, without delay, bestowing it with full powers to act effectively and independently.
WW’s love for the police
Joint Opposition front liner Wimal Weerawansa has taken up cudgels on behalf of the Police officers serving in the North. He has reportedly told a newspaper that police personnel are being harassed in the north and they were prevented from performing their legitimate duties.
This is the same individual who led a mob that grabbed a police officer from his uniform while another hooligan removed the policeman’s hat, opposite the UN compound in Colombo, after he (Weerawansa) was given the green light by Gota to do as they please.
