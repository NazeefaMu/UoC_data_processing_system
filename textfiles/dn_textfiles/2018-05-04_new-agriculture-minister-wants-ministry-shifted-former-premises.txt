New Agriculture Minister wants ministry shifted to former premises

Newly appointed Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera yesterday pledged to take the necessary measures to shift the Agriculture Ministry to its former building ‘Govi Jana Mandiraya’ in Rajamalwatte, Battaramulla.
He was responding to a question raised by a journalist regarding the current building which was the subject of various allegations and criticisms, after assuming duties at his ministry yesterday.
The Minister pledged to discuss with the relevant authorities to acquire the former building ‘Govi Jana Mandiraya’ since it is the most suitable for the purpose.
In September 2015, Cabinet gave approval to acquire the Agricultural Ministry’s building ‘Govijana Mandiraya’ occupied by the Agriculture Ministry.
“I do not want luxury buildings or any other facilities. I only want to provide better facilities to the farmers,” he added.
Amaraweera said the Agriculture Ministry will assiduously continue the programme of encouraging toxin free farming introduced by the President without any abeyance or reversal.
The Minister pledged to take immediate measures to provide financial assistance to farmers those who engage in toxin free farming and will also take measures to provide subsidized fertilizer to the farmers without a shortage or any delay.
“After the Local Government elections , the whole country remained unstable. This unstable situation badly affected the country’s progress. A Cabinet reshuffle was done according to a scientific manner and the relevant subjects of the ministries will be gazetted soon,” Minister Amaraweera said.
“Now we have no time to waste blaming each other. Everybody should understand that the UNP and the SLFP cannot implement only their party policies within the government. So the Unity Government should be continued by taking only the best policies of both parties,” the Minister said.
He stressed that both parties should take the responsibility and work for the betterment of the country without engaging in party politics.
