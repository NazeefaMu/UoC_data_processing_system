Army to release more lands near Myladi Fisheries Harbour

Security Forces Headquarters-Jaffna (SFHQ-J) will release another land patch of 54 acres where the Myladi Fisheries Harbour is situated during a formal ceremony in Jaffna, today.
With the release of this patch of land, displaced families, mostly living with their next of kin are able to return to their original places of residence in Myladi.
A similar release of 35 acres of land in Urani, used by the Security Forces in Jaffna took place earlier on April 7, 2017 in response to humanitarian concerns of displaced people in Jaffna, the Army media unit said.
