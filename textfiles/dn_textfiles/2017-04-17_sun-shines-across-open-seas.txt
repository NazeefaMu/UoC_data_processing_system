Sun shines across open seas

As the flowers of the cherry blossom bloomed in the backdrop of a cold spring in Tokyo, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe sought to champion a vision of Sri Lanka as the trading and logistics hub of the Indian Ocean and a key strategic partner in Japan’s ‘Open and free seas’ policy.
In the Prime Minister’s second official visit to the country and the government’s seventh since taking over office in 2015, the delegation met a host of key Japanese political and business leaders the importance of ‘investing in Sri Lanka’ and to reassure Japan that China’s interest in the island nation did not herald a sunset in Japan.
As Wickremesinghe chose to tie in his foreign policy of ‘freedom of navigation in the oceans’ to that of more open and free commerce between nations, it blended in well with Japanese Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe’s own foreign policy of ‘bounty of the Open Seas: five principles of Japanese diplomacy’.
As Abe spoke of a free and open Indo-Pacific, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe too reiterated such a call and asked that Japan invest in Sri Lanka’s ports - similar to China. He assured that no Sri Lankan port would be used for military activities of any foreign nation and that Sri Lanka would not support any military activity in the Indian Ocean.
Abe in return promised that Japan would invest a billion yen in the development of the Trincomalee port, together with India while he called on Japanese private investments to work look into investing more in Sri Lanka.
Apart from foreign policy, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe concentrated on further strengthening business ties with Japan during his visit and met the Japan Sri Lanka Parliamentarians League, Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO), Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, Mitsubishi Corporation, former Prime Minister of Japan, Yasuo Fukuda, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshide Suga, Minister of Defence, Tomomi Inada, the Japan-Sri Lanka Business Cooperation Committee and Minister of Finance, Taro Aso in a bid to promote Japanese investments into the country.
He emphasized that it was time that more Japanese private investments flowed into Sri Lanka and they were looking to work more with the Japanese private instead of public sector.

At present 150 Japanese firms have set up businesses in Sri Lanka and while Japan and Sri Lanka have enjoyed close ties over the decades, governments have found it difficult to turn Japanese aid and grants into large scale investments in the country. Many of the projects in Sri Lanka like “Infrastructure development, institutional and capacity building, health, telecommunication, IT sector, Colombo Port expansion project, Mahaweli development, irrigation, Colombo Airport expansion, Telecom Network expansion and road and railway rehabilitation”, as Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade, Malik Samarawickrama pointed out to a Business Forum organized by JETRO, were supported by Japan but he also observed that the three year average Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) from Japan to Sri Lanka had been at a mere USD 20 million.
At present trade between Sri Lanka and Japan stands at USD 1.2 billion; the exports from Sri Lanka to Japan is at USD 200 million while the imports from Japan to Sri Lanka is at USD 1.2 billion- six times the value of our annual exports.
“This is hardly anything to talk about. In comparison Japan invests in Thailand as FDI approximately USD 10 billion annually”, said the minister.
Samarawickrama who is on his fourth visit to Japan this year was clear that Japan was very much on Sri Lanka’s agenda and said, “We welcome further investment and collaboration, the time is right now to do so”. He also assured the Japanese businessmen that Sri Lanka was in the process of implementing a “series of reforms to uplift country’s trade and investments especially in the areas of; labour reforms, fiscal and monetary policy reforms, ease of doing business and so on”.
Samarawickrama added that they have also sought advice from the World Bank, Harvard Centre for International Development, and US consultants McKinsey and Company to help usher in reforms. The latter especially has identified that the country should concentrate on the areas of tourism, agriculture and manufacturing to have accelerated growth in the economy.
The minister also hoped to establish an Agency for Development and an Agency for International Trade to “Accelerate enterprise growth and job creation objectives”. He promised that they would further deregulate and offer various incentives such as not charging corporate taxes until the full investment of the business has been recovered to encourage Japanese investments in the country.
“We are also looking at setting up a Japanese industrial township to encourage Japanese companies to set up their businesses in the field of IT, automobile parts manufacturing, electronics, rubber based products manufacturing and fisheries”, he said.
Japanese companies have already submitted proposals for the import and distribution of LNG gas to power plants in the western region of Sri Lanka. Commercial operations are expected to start in 2019 with the generation of 600MW of electricity from existing power plants converted to run on LNG and by 2020, Samarawickrama expected another 2000MW of additional capacity to be generated from newly established plants.
More importantly he touched on the various free trade agreements (FTAs) the government was working on. FTAs are a key policy initiative of the government and it is a move they expect would make Sri Lanka attractive as a trade and logistics hub in the Indian Ocean.
“The Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) with India will increase Sri Lanka’s competitiveness in industrial exports and also increase our supply capacity to better utilize market capacity to India. We are negotiating with an FTA with China and hope to finalize on an FTA with Singapore before June”, said the minister and added,
“We are also looking at the feasibility of an FTA with Japan. This will give Sri Lanka duty free access to a middle class market of 500 million people”.
Minister of Special Assignments, Dr Sarath Amunugama in the meantime also addressing the Business Forum noted that given the expansion in the Japanese economy, “they would have to beyond Japan’s own borders”. This a practice Japan has been doing very well in Sri Lanka and Dr Amunugama pointed out that Japan was the first country to engage in major infrastructure development in Sri Lanka and was a “champion of joint ventures”.
The most famed of its joint ventures was the collaboration of Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corporation (NTT) of Japan with Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) in 1996 when the latter was privatised. The collaboration which turned SLT around also raked in major profits for the Japanese company. When it decided to exit the partnership due to various conflicts, it did so by selling its 35.2 percent stake in SLT to a Malaysian mobile network operator for $297 million, sending Sri Lanka Telecom shares to a record high.
Dr Amunugama who also touched on the Japanese investments in Sri Lanka’s television network in the 80s, said it was a generous gift by the government of Japan at the time.
What he did not touch on was that the while Japan did build two transmitters for Sri Lanka Rupavahini and helped set up our national television network, they also secured the opportunity to sell all Japanese television sets for decades to come as a result.
More recently, when Sri Lanka looked to digitize its television network, it was Japan once again which offered assistance for the upgrade. The deal for the digitization programme which the previous government entered into through a loan agreement with JICA in 2014, came under wide criticism for corruption.
The present government also suspended the project as the “Japanese system was not widely used in countries worldwide and Sri Lanka would have to import Japanese television sets as it is very unlikely that the TV sets available in the Lankan market are compatible with the Japanese system”.
But when the Prime Minister met Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary, Yoshihide Suga last week, they touched on the digitization project and Suga spoke of ways in which they could further speed things up with the deal.
Rolling out the carpet for Japanese investments
“The present Sri Lankan government is the most favourable to private investment. We are looking at the private sector as the engine of growth in Sri Lanka. While previous governments have said this, we are trying to put flesh and blood in that vision”, said Dr Amunugama and asked that Japan come in big, “Particularly in the area of joint venture development for infrastructure and set up a special manufacturing centre in the country”.
Japanese businesses have shown certain interest in Sri Lanka and the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry together with the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO) and JICA organised a third working group meeting in Colombo in March of this year to promote Japanese investment to Sri Lanka. They discussed ways in which they could “realize a competitive business environment, improve customs and logistics operations and establish an effective dialogue and problem solving mechanisms between Sri Lanka and Japan”.
Resident representative of JETRO Colombo, Kazuhiko Obama addressing the Business Forum said Sri Lanka should be approached as a ‘Gateway to India”.
Chairman and CEO of JETRO, Hiroyuki Ishige added that as Indian ports were very difficult to access, Sri Lanka could become an important export and logistics centre.
Obama explained that while labour costs in Sri Lanka were rising, Japanese companies should move towards hiring quality people rather than cheap labour.
As the per capita income of the country rises, Obama noted that there was a growing middle class market within Sri Lanka too which looked for better quality goods, “They have consumers but no retailers’, he said.
Greater inflow of tourists into the island nation has also been observed with great interest by Obama as he explained that “70 percent of Noritake sales in Sri Lanka came from tourists, especially Indian tourists”.
End of May this year, the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce is to hold a conference to promote exchanges between businesses of the two countries and Obama asked that Japanese businessmen use this opportunity to look for a local partner they can work with.
Location, Location, Location
The underlying theme of the trip made clear at every meeting was that ‘if Japan wanted markets to expand to, Sri Lanka would offer them the platform for expansion’.
“One of the main reasons why you should invest in Sri Lanka, is because of its location”, said Dr Amunugama as he explained that while this would not only give access to India- one of the biggest emerging markets in the world but the island’s location was also excellent for exporting to the European, Middle Eastern and African markets.
“Sri Lanka also shares close ties with China, the next biggest market. Furthermore to the South of Sri Lanka we have a tension free sea and almost every drop of oil which travels to Japan passes through Sri Lanka”, added Dr Amunugama, as he hoped that the country’s location alone would attract the much needed FDIs into Sri Lanka.
