President calls for better coordination between politicians, SLAS officials

The link between politicians and members of the Sri Lanka Administrative Service (SLAS) should be strengthened for the speedy implementation of development projects, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
The President also said that due to poor coordination between public servants and politicians, most of the funds allocated for various development programmes is sent back to the Treasury at the end of the year.
President Sirisena added that this phenomenon affects the country’s development and regular meetings need to be held tio irin out various issues.
President Sirisena was speaking at the 34th Annual General Meeting of the Sri Lanka Administrative Service Association at the Nelum Pokuna Mahinda Rajapaksa Performing Art Theatre. The President also said that mostly the monthly, quarterly and progress review meetings of public institutions, Provincial Development Committees, District Development Committees are not often held due to the difficulty of fixing a day that the politicians could attend.
“Therefore, an annual calendar should be prepared fixing the days which do not clash with Parliament and Provincial Council sittings,” the President added.
“When these problems are overcome, development projects could be implemented and the public will stand to benefit the most,” the President said. President Sirisena also said that the government has set up independent commissions introducing the Right to Information Act, Audit Act and many other laws strengthening the Sri Lanka Administrative Service. The President added that governments have provided the SLAS members with the knowledge and experience to render an efficient public service. The President also appreciated the services rendered by the SLAS to the country.
