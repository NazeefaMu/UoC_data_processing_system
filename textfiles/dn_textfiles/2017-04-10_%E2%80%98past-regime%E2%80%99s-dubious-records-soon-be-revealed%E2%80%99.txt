‘Past regime’s dubious records soon to be revealed’

All details of murders, corruption, and malpractices of the previous regime will be revealed to the public in a few months, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Minister Dr. Senaratne said once the details were revealed, the Joint Opposition will breathe its last.
He expressed these views after opening the new Dialysis Unit of Kebithigollewa Base Hospital on Saturday.
Minister Dr. Senaratne said the people will not take part in the Joint Opposition’s (JO) May Day rally as predicted by the JO.
He added that the proposals on the SAITM which had been approved by the President will be jointly implemented by the Higher Education Ministry and the Health Ministry.
