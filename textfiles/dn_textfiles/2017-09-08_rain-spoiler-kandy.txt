Rain, a spoiler in Kandy

The first inter school match in the central hills for the 2017/18 season between Dharmaraja College and Vidyartha College came to a disappointing end at Lake View grounds on Thursday with the game called off due to rain. In this traditional game Rajans won the toss, and elected to bat first and the game started late due to rain at 11 a.m. Rajans who are under the watchful eyes of Senaka Dissanayake took lunch with the score reading 58 for 4. When play was stopped for a second time at 2.53 pm Rajans were 141 for 5 with Sachintha Senanayake making a solid 43 with seven hits to the ropes and Isuru Dayananda not out on 46 with six fours.
Raviska Upananda and Isuru Praboda took two wickets each. On the second day not a ball was bowled, due to wet weather and the match was called off. Rajans next play Maliyadeva College on Monday and Tuesday.
Scores: Dharmaraja College 141-5 (Sachintha Senanayake 43, Isuru Dayananda 46 n.o., Raviska Upananda 2/11, Isuru Praboda 2/23) v Vidyartha.
