Unparalleled academic progress

A marvellously renowned spot known as Sujatha Vidyalaya with a heritage of glorious history stands out as the most significant and popular among many schools in Colombo. Situated around five minutes’ drive from Nugegoda junction in a picturesque scenic location, originally surrounded by lush greenery, now consisting of an intellectual crowd is a well-established perfect educational institution in the true sense of the word.
This enchanting place is among the oldest set ups in Colombo well before the international schools came into existence which throws light on the immediate post-Independence era. History of Sujatha Vidyalaya dates back to 1965 when it was first founded in No. 17, Alfred Place, Colpetty, Colombo. Whatever this may mean, it cannot be denied that Sujatha Vidyalaya owes its origin to Colpetty though later moved to reputed places in Queens Road, Jayah Road and finally to Nugegoda where the highest quality of education is offered for a better world.
Early beginnings
The school was founded on June 1, 1965, by the Founder, Architect and Pioneer late Linton Kuruppu, joined by Clara Motwani as the Principal well experienced. They both devoted their lives to the magnificent task.
There lies the beginning of this great institution. It heralded the beginning of Sri Lanka’s education in English medium after the departure of the colonial masters from then Ceylon, the fascinating history that was to change the face of Sri Lanka. It was during this time that the then Sujathians dipped their pens in the ink pot to write English for the first time.
This needs no further explanation to the intelligentsia of the present day. The name of Sujatha has spread around the globe. Here is the central and main destination that part of the city of Nugegoda is being adorned by Sujatha in several places and also Maharagama.
The tactful manner in facing immediate problems and their determinations to guide it in the correct path made them work hard. A good foundation was laid by giving special attention to religious work and numerous other extra activities like sports aesthetic and other living skills like home science and needlework (subjects of the day) popularising them with exhibitions and competitions. Reading is encouraged by setting up a good library. The prefect system is well organised.
The challenges faced so bravely by the duo was what made Sujatha unique to be carried forward by his son Lakshman Kuruppu who took over an icon in the field of education. The demise of his father meant a lifetime commitment by him culminating in a wide awakening in education par excellence renowned for its high standards.
Wonderful effort
Lakshman Kuruppu, being young and vibrant, soon after his foreign education, took over Sujatha and opened the door to a new era. He was offered the TOYP award for exceptional academic success and selflessly devoted service to the nation. His dream was to reach the highest level possible. In his mission for the quality education he did succeed and Sujatha today has made her mark in all-around performance island-wide and across the globe.
Sujatha has been a focus of worldwide admiration more so for the unlimited ability and talent of the present management. His work in this sphere is too numerous to be mentioned here in detail. It is to be witnessed by the present generation.
Massive contribution
However, it must be stated that admission to Sujatha has certainly become a major concern. There are many schools to choose from in the vicinity. But the rush is for name Sujatha is nothing strange. He is widely known for his dedication and his massive contribution to his loyal staff cannot be estimated in black and white. The name and fame of Sujatha have spread everywhere so much so that it ranks best among the best performing schools winning acclaim for the best English medium school. Sujatha today has become a household name the entire complex and the Sujathian family found in the above mentioned places is a clear indication of vision and foresight of the determined young manager. This is quite a successful noble mission.
Having just concluded the Golden Jubilee celebrations with much grandeur, the school birthday too is an important celebration in the school calendar. This conveys a deep message to the student generation. It is full of rich culture and history and is truly a learning experience to the present students. This really and truly conveys a deep message to the student generation the historic significance and what Sujatha truly means – a request by the writer who served Sujatha for nearly two decades (1985 – 2004).
Sujathians, across the globe wherever you are, do respect, revere and salute your Alma Mater unsparingly on this day and ever afterwards.
