Fighting to improve the lives of workers

As strikes cripple the country and unions become a ‘dirty word’ in the eyes of the public, Rakhi Sehgal, Indian labour researcher, trade unionist, Vice President of the Contract Workers Union (Hero Honda Theka Mazdoor Sangathan) in the State of Haryana and Member of the National Executive Committee, New Trade Union Initiative (NTUI), a national federation of independent trade unions, spoke of a new movement of trade unionists who are breaking away from the traditional and politicized union centres to challenge the status quo and reclaim the labour movement to fight for what it fundamentally stands for- the rights of the workers.
Following are the excerpts of the interview
Q. You returned to India for your post graduate research and chose to stay back?
A. I have abandoned my PhD for the moment. My PhD research was on labour, the official title was ‘social reproduction of labour’ looking at contract labour in the garment and auto manufacturing industry and I wanted to look at new manufacturing areas, which Gurgaon was. Initially, I was talking to garment factory workers on simple battles like; getting their provident fund, trying to get children into school, getting their minimum wage or just being treated with respect when they go to the Labour Department. Many of the issues were affecting me and the workers told me, ‘so many of you have come and gone. Done your research and become professors but our situation is the same’. Also at the time, I too felt that the research I was doing was far too removed from the realities of the workers.
In 2003, I landed in Delhi and it was the same year there was a General Strike in opposition to the neo-liberal turn the government had taken. It was an interesting time, for the labour movement and that caught my attention. I went to all the rallies and strikes we had.
Q. India is experiencing fast economic growth and industrialization, in that respect, do you see labour movements too growing along or being pulled back?
A. the labour movement has no choice but to grow. Workers have no choice but to organize, whether the central trade unions are able to address the issues or not.
And if you see the Maruti struggle; which is a very organized sector, the way in which the plant level workers articulated and headed the struggle, it was ahead of what our imagination; shaped by what central trade unions and established trade unions had told us was possible. So the fact these workers stood for the longest time in solidarity with their contract worker comrades was instructive in that it told us that the core of this struggle was the inequality between the contract and permanent worker.
And they ensured that they were fighting as much for the contract workers as themselves. And here they displayed a certain maturity in understanding. If the shop floor had a majority of contract workers, what is the point in forming a permanent workers’ union which is ultimately going to speak for a very small population?
Organizing movements in Sri Lanka should also happen outside of the traditional sectors, outside of government and in the private sector. Possibly where there are large numbers of migrant workers, precarious, manpower, illegal migrants and contract workers.
Q. In the sub-continent, more often than not, trade unions are often politicized and few stand for the rights of workers. Do you see workers moving away from such political affiliations?
A. In India, yes. The new trade union I am affiliated to, the National Federation of Independent Trade Unions (NFIT), they are not affiliated to any political party. It does not mean we don’t follow a left ideology, which we of course do, but the experience of the neo-liberal turn of the Indian policies and how left parties were part of the electoral process and the space for addressing labour issues, narrowed down, even for the parent parties. And that was what triggered the battles within the unions and either there was exodus- voluntary or not out of those spaces and the workers felt that they needed to take it the battles into their own hands to be able to lead their own battles without their interest being used as a bargaining chip in electoral politics. I think increasingly we are finding the same thing happening in other South Asian countries as well.
Sri Lanka is an interesting example because it experimented with neo-liberalism much earlier than other South Asian countries. In a way we are seeing the extreme devastation of labour because of neo-liberal policies and the need to recover from that and rebuild the labour movement; it is a unique challenge and is something that the rest of South Asia is watching.
Q. But do you see many trade unions breaking away from the old trade union structures?
A. It is an interesting negotiation between the two and there too, it depends on the demographic profile. When you take India, the demographic profile of new workers is that they are young, they have economic aspirations given the kind of consumer culture they are exposed to and have the militancy of youth.
There is new dynamism coming from India in the organization of contract workers, the unorganized sector workers, women workers saying no to the central trade unions when they don’t give space for the women leadership or if they don’t give space to air their issues. There they say they will form their own unions.
This is not to say that the new movements are not collaborating with the older unions or taking their advice, but they are certainly re-negotiating their relationship with their older trade union centres.
Q. What is the role of women in these trade unions? Most of the agricultural and industrial workforce, at least in Sri Lanka is made up of women, but we see few in leadership positions in unions?
A. Yes it continues to be a struggle on how we can create a space for women’s issues and women’s ways of articulating issues that male comrades don’t see as important. This would also help break the gender dynamic within the family. As long as these chores are contained within the private household, it is a woman’s job, but the minute it comes out into the public sphere, the men do it and have no problems doing it. That’s one way of addressing it.
Q. You have spoken of the idea of criminalisation of labour and securitisation of industrial spaces?
A. When workers are in that desperate situation, they have no choice but to unionise because they realize that their only protection is in numbers.
Many in the middle class, don’t understand the motivation of the people whose backs are against the walls constantly. They are the ones who are really fighting the battle for all of us.
At times there are no other options. There are no other jobs and when they do have jobs, it doesn’t pay well so they want to stay in there, dig in their heels and fight.
But the fact that they are being criminalized is serious. It is no longer a labour or industrial issue, it is quickly being turned into a law and order issue and criminal cases are being filed against the workers. And somewhere there, the injustice of it is fuelling the anger of the workers and they are able to overcome their fears.
Q. You have also spoken about how not having a proper space to articulate issues related to industry is leading to such serious problems?
A. Yes that is the case at least in Gurgaon.
The larger question is, ‘what is the extent of crisis in capitalism in this existing phase of accumulation that it is forcing capital to rely on the state and repressive mechanisms and institutions of the state to discipline labour?’. Usually economic methods are sufficient, so why does capital now globally have to rely on extra-economic and coercive apparatuses? It is something we as labour activists haven’t fully grappled with or understood. Therein lies perhaps a seed of a fight back. If this is a moment of extreme crisis of accumulation, then how do we reshape this balance of power battle? I still don’t have answers to that. But this is how I read the securitisation of industrial spaces.
Q. Some of these demands such as fair wages, clean and safe environments to work in are quite basic. Why do you think there is such resistance from industries to grant these demands to workers?
A. In my personal opinion, to treat workers as rights based individuals is to empower them. Capitalists do not want an empowered labour force which demands a seat at the table with them. There is also a remnant feudal mentality here, we think that workers are sub human. The discourse of capitalism has created workers as the ‘other’ and therefore not someone that should be demanding any rights. That construct is certainly at work in South Asia. Also the belief that they are getting enough and that they need not get more. It is also a disciplining mechanism; the spectre of poverty is disciplining mechanism. The premise that there are another 100 workers waiting to get your job is a disciplining mechanism, similarly the increasing use of sexual violence against women.
In Sri Lanka, you are facing a shortage of construction and garment workers, why isn’t there enough training of local workers? Why do you have to import workers? And even if there is a requirement, why isn’t there an agreement for skills transfer and training of workers so that you don’t have to depend on foreign workers? The government also has to have the imagination and pressure from the people to say that we are fine with X number of people coming into Y sectors, for a certain number of months, etc…
Q. When you take the struggles in Maruti or Honda in India, the working conditions of their workers in their home country are better than that of India. Why is the level of accountability low when they invest abroad?
A. That is because of the manner in which their own local laws have emerged and are backed by the kind of social forces that are at work. When they come over here, our own state is saying we have lax labour laws and that we won’t implement them, so our state is also complacent in it.
That is why we need an engaged citizenry which does not allow national boundaries to colour what is right and wrong. If we want to the companies to be held accountable to the same standards as in their home countries, it is also our responsibility to hold our companies accountable when they are engaging in similar activities abroad.
As labour activists in South Asia, we also need to look outside of the box, and understand the proper level we have in which to confront capitalism. We need to collaborate in the region more for meaningful action on the ground.
Q. What makes the relationship between industry and unions always antagonistic?
A. That is a post 1970s interpretation. If you see the labour movement post World War II, there was a certain equilibrium worked out between the labour movements and capital. A certain amount of rebuilding needed to happen and as we came into assembly lines, a certain amount of regularization had to be done. At that moment, unions were seen as friends that could help capital do that kind of work and also inculcate those values among workers. A social pact was made with the workers, that they too would see a sort of improvement in their living standard as industry grew. Post 1970s, attack on labour came with the moment of crisis of global accumulation of capital, I think when we cast our eyes on unions and capital, it has to be a more historic gaze. Today they are antagonistic, because capital is in crisis and wants a free hand to over exploit whether it is a natural resource or human. Anyone who challenges capital’s right to take shortcuts to accumulate short term profits is seen as the enemy.
