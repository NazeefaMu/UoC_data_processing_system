Lasantha, Noyahr controversies:MR refutes  allegations

Kurunegala District Parliamentarian and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said he had no connection whatsoever to the killing of editor Lasantha Wickrematunge or the abduction of journalist Keith Noyahr.
Certain people are drawning his name into these two incidents merely to sling mud at him, he seaid.
Mahinda Rajapaksa was speaking to the media after opening a branch of 'Rich Look' department store in Ratnapura on February 24. He said parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa's decision to sever conenctions with the UPFA group in parliament was a good thing. He said, however, Weerawansa was working in league with the joint opposition.
The former President said the 'Flower Bud' was now slowly blossoming. He added that there is a rumour about an election in May. "But one could not be certain until it is announced," he said. However, the joint opposition was ready to face an election at anytime, he said.
Parliamentarians Ranjith Zoysa, Janaka Wakkumbura, Dallus Alahapperuma, Rohitha Abeygunawardena, and Sabaragumwa Pronvicial Council Chairman Kanchana Jayaratne were present.
