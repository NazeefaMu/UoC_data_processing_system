Trinco Oil Tank Farm to be developed as a joint venture between CPC,Lanka IOC :PM

The political decision to develop Trincomalee Oil Tank Farm as a joint venture between the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and the Lanka IOC has been made, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe informed Parliament yesterday.
The Prime Minister, tabling the MoU on cooperation in economic development projects signed between the Governments of Sri Lanka and India during his visit to India last month, observed the MoU includes developing Trincomalee Upper Tank Farm as a joint venture.
“Since 2003, the Sri Lankan Government is obtaining USD 100,000 per annum from the LIOC for the tanks leased to it. None said no to those monies. Now we have decided to lease this land to a joint venture and develop it. Our plan is to make use of this storage facility to enable the CPC to enter Indian market. There is no legal agreement yet. All stakeholders including the trade unions would be consulted before finalising the agreement,” he noted.
The Prime Minister said the political MoU also includes proposals of a 500 MW LNG plant in Kerawalapitiya, 50 MW solar power plant in Sampur, appointing a joint committee to develop the Trincomalee harbour, encouraging Indian investors to invest in special economic zones in Sri Lanka, development of Northern road network and Lankan Railway line, construction of a new container terminal at the Colombo port also with Japan and CPC, and development of agriculture and livestock.
“We have set time frames and now the two Governments should initiate discussions on each of the proposal in the MoU and ink agreements separately,” he said.
He said Parliament would be informed of those agreements once finalised.
The Prime Minister commenting on Trincomalee development said the Magapolis and Western Development Ministry is making plans in this regard with a Singaporean company.
“The private sector can make their own investments here and Japan and India have expressed their willingness to bring such investments. The operation of the port will be under the Sri Lankan Government. We should be able to deal with any country, attract their investments and develop our country. We are dealing with the companies of those countries and not the Governments. We will be unable to pay our debts unless we double our exports,” he added.
The Premier, responding to a supplementary question by Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Leader Udaya Gammanpila on the proposal over the gas distribution pipeline mentioned in the MoU, said it was only a concept adding that all parties could discuss and work out the details later.
“The LNG Terminal/Floating Storage Regasification Unit in Kerawalapitiya is a project which Sri Lanka, India and Japan will work together. Minister Kabir Hashim proposed to include even Litro Gas Company to this project. Likewise, the concept can be developed through discussion. By any means, we will not let the security of the country be at stake. This has no connection to Manner gas deposits. Mannar gas deposits belong to our country and it is up to us to decide how to use it commercially” the Premier explained.
The Prime Minister said the Cabinet of Ministers had given its approval for the MoU.
