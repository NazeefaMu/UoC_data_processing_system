Piyasena Gamage next in line

Piyasena Gamage is next in line to be appointed to the Parliament seat rendered vancant by the Court of Appeal due to disqualification of Geetha Kumarasinghe although the latter can appeal to the Supreme Court against the judgement, UPFA General Secretary and Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
Addressing a press conference at the SLFP Head quarters in Colombo yesterday he said that the judgement was given based on the 19th Amendment which was passed in Parliament with the intention of ensuring the rightful place to citizens of Sri Lanka to be elected to Parliament.
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said MP Geetha Kumarasinghe can appeal to the Supreme Court against the judgement delivered by the Court of Appeal but if the Supreme Court gives the same judgement, several other MPs in the current Parliament too will be disqualified to be in Parliament as members.
