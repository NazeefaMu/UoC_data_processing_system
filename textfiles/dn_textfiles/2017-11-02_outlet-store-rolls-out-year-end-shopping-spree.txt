The Outlet Store rolls out year-end shopping spree

With a passion to provide an exclusive family shopping experience and a continuous drive to be one of Sri Lanka’s leading fashion stores, The Outlet Store has yet again rolled out a fabulous shopping spree from October 27 to November 4, as part of its year-end sale.
Since its inception just early this year The Outlet Store has witnessed an ever increasing interest and success throughout all shopper segments and probably today is Colombo’s hottest trending clothing retail space. With numerous additions to its range of portfolio every now and then, customers are always sure to be picking up something new and contemporary.
The Outlet Store Clothing Managing Director Sharhan Mansoor said ‘We are very delighted to give our shoppers significant discounts that are almost half of the total bill as part of our year-end sales strategy. We have brought together a much bigger range and variety this time around to complement every aspect of one’s lifestyle. It truly brings us happiness to see them smile while they shop till they drop.’ The Outlet Store is gaining grounds as a much sought after shopping destination featuring contemporary and trending merchandise, and is very ambitious to open up more stores in Sri Lanka’s most preferred fashion destinations in the future.
