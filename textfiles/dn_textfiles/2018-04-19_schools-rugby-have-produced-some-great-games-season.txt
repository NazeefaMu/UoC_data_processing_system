Schools rugby have produced some great games this season

Schools rugby has produced some great games this season except for three lower division teams, the other Kandy schools have not fared that well in their first round games, however, after a week’s lay off they are bound to come back strongly for the rest of the first round.
Although all schools have hit a winning streak they will however be looking for more victories. They will have plenty of work ahead of them with tough games left on the schedule, and the boys will need to consistently produce wins to be in contention during the second round. Players will be looking to keep improving their skills and show their worth so that the coaches know who will be in the reckoning.
The second round matches are going to be competitive, interesting and very close games with close finishes. The organizers must therefore ensure that there are no good games clashing on the same day.
Kingswood who are placed 3rd in Segment –I A will play St. Joseph’s College on April 20 Friday in Colombo. Kingswood has won two against Trinity and St. Anthony’s and lost two. They are well guided by Dinesh Gamage. They played well in their two wins and should look to a good combination for the rest of the games.
Trinity are placed 4th in the Segment -I A and will play their key game on April 21 in Colombo against Royal College, in the first leg of the most looked forward to Bradby Shield. Trinitians this time did not live up to expectations they beat St. Anthony’s and St. Thomas’, and lost to St. Joseph’s and Kingswood. Coach Lote Taikabula is going all out to put things in order but something is lacking in the Trinity line up.
They have not matched the level they should have; it was disappointing they failed to win the important matches. It was very clear that their defence, the contact play and attacking accuracy - weren't anywhere near where they need to be. In stages they play well but are unable to sustain any continuity, most of the time the options they take as a team go the other way. St. Anthony’s College, who are 4th placed, were expected to fare well this season with all areas of coaching and player development taken care of, but somehow they have failed. They have lost all four games played so far in Segment –I A to Trinity, Royal, Kingswood and St. Joseph’s. Their next game is on April 24 Thursday with S.Thomas’ at Nittawela.
Dharmaraja playing in the Division I Segment “B” coached by Kapila Silva, unfortunately have failed to win any matches in their segment. They have lost to Isipathana, St. Peter’s and D.S. Senanayake.
Their next game is with Zahira College on April 21Saturday in Colombo. Their coach has done his best, and have put them on the right path by citing the improvements made to his squad’s depth since he took over. But the players have failed to perform as a team.
St. Sylvester’s playing in Segment – I B, under the coaching of Aruna Rankothge have played four games, out of which they have two wins against Ananda and Piliyandala Central and lost two games to Science and Vidyartha. Their next game is on April 24 against St. Benedict’s College in Colombo.
Vidyartha College playing in Segment - I B have won all the matches they played beating Ananda, Piliyandala Central, St. Benedict's and St. Sylvester’s. Their next game is on April 22 against Science College. A big hand to their coaches Sumeda Malawena and Danushka Pushpakumara former players of Kandy Sports Club for the excellent job done this season.
Sri Rahula playing the Division 2 Segment – I B under the guidance of Nalin Wijesinghe have played three and won all matches, against Mahinda College Galle, President’s College Maharagama and Sri Sumangala Panadura and have to play Vidyaloka Galle, Zahira Mawanella and Eheliyagoda MMV.
Sri Sumangala (St.Paul’s) coached by G. Gunadasa, are playing in the Segment I IC and have done their best by beating all the schools they met, Nalanda, Moratuwa MV, Royal Panadura by over 100 points and their next game is with St .John’s Nugegoda on April 24 at Digana grounds.
