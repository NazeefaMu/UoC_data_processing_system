Lankan held in islet off Dhanushkodi

Dhanushkodi Police arrested a Sri Lankan Tamil when he clandestinely landed in an islet off Dhanushkodi on Thursday night.
A police party on routine patrolling found M. Duke Prithiviraj, 36, walking towards the shore and arrested him. Prithiviraj, a native of Mannar district, had left Mannar around 3 p.m. on Thursday after engaging a fibre boat, paying 60,000 Sri Lankan rupees and reached the fifth islet off Dhanushkodi around 9 p.m.
Two boatmen returned after dropping him, police said. After waiting for an hour in the islet, he was walking towards the shore at Palam when the police arrested him.
He was arrested under Section 4 of the Foreigners Act, read with Section 3 (a) and 6 (a) of the Passport (Entry into India) Rules, 1950. He was produced before the local magistrate court and taken to Chennai to be lodged in Puzhal Central Prison, the police said. Q Branch Inspector of Police R. Kennedy said the Lankan Tamil, who was living separately pending a divorce case, had visited Madurai in 2014 with his two children. After reaching Madipakkam in Chennai, he went to Australia along with 140 Lankan Tamils. - The Hindu
