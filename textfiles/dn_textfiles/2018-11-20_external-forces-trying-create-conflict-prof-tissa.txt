External forces trying to create conflict - Prof. Tissa

Some external forces are behind the attempt to create a conflict between the Executive and the Legislature and bring the unpopular UNP government back to power, former Minister Prof.Tissa Vitarana charged yesterday.
Addressing a media briefing organised by the Socialist Alliance in Colombo, Prof. Vitarana said President Mithripala Sirisena had acted in accordance with the powers vested in him under the Constitution when appointing a new Prime Minister.
Prof. Vitarana explained that after the collapse of the coalition government, the President had tried to get a senior leader from the UNP as the Premier instead of Ranil Wickremesinghe and after the attempt failed, he had decided to appoint former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who had wide support not only among Parliamentarians but from the people as well.
The former minister stressed that the best way out this political impasse was to hold a General Election and let the people’s sovereignty prevail.
Prof. Vitarana accused some Western nations and external forces of trying to aggravate the situation and create a conflict between the Executive and the Legislature.
He said the President had been absolutely correct when he called for a General Election and added that all Parliamentarians should support the move.
He said 6.2 million had voted for President Maithripala Sirisena and 5.8 million people had voted for Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa at the last Presidential polls and added that a government under the two strong leaders was the best way forward for the country.
Meanwhile, Socialist Alliance member Raja Collure said the UNP had no majority of their own and were depending on the JVP and the TNA for support in Parliament.
He also said that a General Election was the only way out of this political imbroglio.
Collure also criticised the behaviour of the Speaker during the recent turmoil in Parliament and added instead of protecting Parliament traditions and standing orders the Speaker had violated them.
