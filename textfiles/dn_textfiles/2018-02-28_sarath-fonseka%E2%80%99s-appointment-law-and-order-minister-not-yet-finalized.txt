Sarath Fonseka’s appointment as Law and Order Minister not yet finalized

 
Co-Cabinet Spokesman Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said that a new Cabinet Minister for Law and Order will definitely be appointed in two weeks and the decision to appoint Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka has not yet been finalized.
The Minister said this while responding to a question raised by a Journalist at the weekly Cabinet Media Briefing held today at the Government Information Department.
The Minister said that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe swore in as the Law and Order Minister only for two weeks.
Proposals were made to appoint Filed Marshal Fonseka as the Law and Order Minister and he was abroad when the Cabinet reshuffle took place.
 “There is nothing strange in appointing Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe as the Law and Order Minister and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa also took over the same Ministry under his purview for a period of nearly two years.” said the Minister.
