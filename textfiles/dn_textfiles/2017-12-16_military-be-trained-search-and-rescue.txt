Military to be trained in search and rescue

The Asia Pacific Alliance for Disaster Management (A-PAD) has forged a partnership with the Sri Lanka military, especially the Air Force (SLAF) in conducting a professional training with international experts in an effort to formalize the approaches taken in search and rescue for volunteers and the military.
The Disaster Management Centre provided assistance and coordination related to the training. The SLAF disposed of its ground and air assets to train the first-ever civil-military coordinated exercise under the leadership of the Commander of the Air Force. A-PAD SL with other volunteer groups coordinated the training programme at the SLAF Station in Koggala.
“Urban flooding too poses a severe threat which requires better professionalism and the identification of appropriate search and rescue equipment for lifesaving operations. While the military has its search and rescue capacity; enhancing their knowledge via training to achieve international standards in S&R, will provide an opportunity to save more lives by promoting efficiency, enhance quality and coordination.
This will also enable these teams to be deployed in the region to support other countries. Due to these reasons, the need to train volunteers and the SL Forces to further enhance capacity in Search and Rescue operations is vital,” stated A-PAD in a media release.
Through the expertise of four A-PAD international trainers from Japan, the training programme was conducted for the Sri Lankan Forces and volunteers from November 19 to 21, 2017. The objective of the training was to introduce and practice disaster response methodologies for sudden-onset disaster aligned with internationally accepted International Search and Rescue Advisory Group (INSARAG) guidelines in the process of preparedness, cooperation and coordination.
The training programme consisted of a ‘Preparation Phase’ to familiarize participants with internationally agreed upon deployment and coordination procedures, based on INSARAG Guidelines. The ‘Operational Phase’ incorporated a two-and-a-half-day training and simulation exercise where the participant groups were confronted with an initial situation where only limited information is provided and “tasks” which the role players should complete are injected by exercise controllers through various channels such as field assessment, technology, media reports etc.
Civil-military coordinated flood rescue simulation exercise was carried out following competency of individual and collective skills. Ground and air rescue simulation exercises provided live experience for participants and also identified limitations.
The combined resource strength between civil and military in saving lives was evident following the training.
Whilst the current training was limited to flood rescue, training in all disciplines will be conducted systematically. Civil Military cooperation will be further strengthened to create better humanitarian responses with professional training and appropriate equipment.
