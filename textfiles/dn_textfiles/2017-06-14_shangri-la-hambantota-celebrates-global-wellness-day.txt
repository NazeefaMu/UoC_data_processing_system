Shangri-La - Hambantota celebrates Global Wellness Day

Shangri-La’s Hambantota Resort & Spa celebrated ‘Global Wellness Day’ on June 10 at their down South luxury resort with an array of activities where the guests, staffers and invitees were involved enthusiastically. A day-long programme commenced at 8.00 am with a one hour exercising session, ‘The Boot Camp’ conducted by the resort’s dynamic physical instructruss Sasha. It seemed a casual musical exercising session at the beginning, but did not take much time to bathe the participants in sweat. Sasha carried on with her commands while performing the exercises at the same time, which only a professional trainer would have been capable of. With a few short water breaks and relaxing sessions, the action continued to the rhythm of music. One would never thought such simple physical activities will push your strengths to its limits until the whole body feels the strain. At least if everyone can accomodate a 15-25 minutes exercising session into their day-to-day life, there will be a huge drop in country’s money spent on medicines. While their parents were at the Boot Camp, their rioting kids were seem tamed during the kids’ yoga session at the children’s play station. It was amazing to see little kids performing yoga postures in unison enticed by the spirit of yoga.
Shangri-La - Hambantota offers many recreational and sporting activities with three swimming pools, a scenic 18 hole golf course, modern exercising gym, cycling, badminton, billiards, table tennis and a unique sporting facility for trampoline and trapeze. Very few participated in this seemingly dangerous trapeze acquaintance session which is an activity demands both lot of physical and mental strength. The trapeze facility at Shangri-La - Hambantota is a well maintained premises with safety at its best. It’s just for those who dare and confident of let their body swing to and fro from about 30 feet high. The start is the hardest, but when you hold the hanging bar firmly and let your body swing, you slowly get the peaceful easy feeling. It was an unforgettable experience for those who tried. The activity has a significance on this ‘Global Wellness Day’ as it combines main two aspects of wellness, the physic and the mind.
The lunch at ‘Bojunhala’ had a special arrangement under the theme of ‘Rooted in Nature’ where some traditionally cooked healthy food dishes were offered to savour.
Resort’s one of the restaurants, Gimanhala was the venue for evening’s most anticipated event, ‘Conquer Your Everest’ with Jayanthi and Johann. It was nearly two and a half hours of mixed emotions listening to one of the greatest stories ever told of courage, commitment, strength and Perseverance by a great daughter and a son of mother Lanka, Jayanthi Kuru-Utumpala and Jojann Peries, the first Sri Lankans to stamp their footprints on top of the world.

They summed up their long story from preparation to triumph taking the listeners on an emotional voyage full of excitement, fear, sorrow and pride. It was no surprise to see many listeners wiping their eyes at the end of the presentation. Their story remains an example to how people can turn impossible to reality. Every bit of their journey holds a great story behind which we all have lessons to learn, not just in achieving goals, but for the wellness of our day-to-day lives.
The final activity of the programme, the yoga session for adults on the beach near Sunset Pool was a smooth treat to the mind and body. The weekly yoga session at the resort is another most looked forward event and many staffers were seen participating in the session on ‘Global Wellness Day’. The musical chants, the setting sun and cool breeze caressed body and soul, leaving us at total peace and contentment. What a wonderful wellness day..!
