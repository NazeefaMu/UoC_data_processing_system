India, Sri Lanka resume bilateral talks on maritime boundary issue today at Taj Samudra

Round two of the bilateral discussions over Indo-Sri Lanka fishery and maritime boundary issue take place today at Taj Samudra, Colombo.
The Sri Lankan ocean floor is gradually turning into a lifeless seabed due to the illegal bottom trolling method being used by the Indian fishermen.
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, considering these circumstances, ordered to arrest the Indian fishing boats and bring to the court.
122 fishing vessels and other equipment were confiscated in 2015. The arrested were released on humanitarian reasons.
Bilateral discussions began between the two countries on a request by the Indian government. The first session took place in New Delhi last November. Indian Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh along with a delegation of 11 will participate in the discussion.
The Sri Lankan delegation comprises Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, State Fisheries Minister Dilip Wedaarachchi, government officials, TNA MP M.A. Sumanthiran, Defence Secretary Karunasena Hettiarachchi and 15 navy officials.
