Solar cells for low income families

Soorya Bala Sangramaya is to provide free solar cells for low-income families, Minister of Power and Renewable Energy Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.
Minister Siyambalapitiya pointed out this revolutionary plan will be a turning point in Sri Lanka’s sustainable energy generation.
He said the Green Climate Fund is to facilitate the project together with the Electricity Board at present.
Minister Siyambalapitiya pointed out, the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy is to introduce this program since the low-income families were reluctant to invest in net metering and net accounting methods introduced by the Sooriya Bala Sangramaya, due to their serious financial difficulties.
“In this method, the low-income families need not spend any money to fix a solar cell on their rooftops. They only have to come to a written agreement with the Electricity Board and the company which is providing them a solar cell.” Minister Siyambalapitiya pointed out.
The low income families who have provided their rooftops for this project will not have to pay their electricity bill for five years, Minister Siyambalapitiya said.
“Add to this, the rooftop lender will receive a monthly payment, at least a minimum of Rs.500 for their given out space,” he also said. “When the agreement is over, the rooftop lenders will receive the half of the income generated by the solar cell,” Minister Siyabalapitiya added.
Minister Siyabalapitiya invited private investors to join hands with this project.
