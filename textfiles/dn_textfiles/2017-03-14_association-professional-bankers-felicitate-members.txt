Association of Professional Bankers felicitate members

It is customary for the Association of Professional Bankers, the premier organization of banking professionals in the country, to recognize members who have reached the pinnacle of their professional careers or achieved high officers. The Council recently recognized two such high achievers in Colombo. The felicitated members were Ravi Dias in recognition of his appointment to the office of Chairman Seylan Bank PLC and Nanda Fernando, in recognition of his appointment to the office of Managing Director Sampath Bank PLC.
