If established in Sri Lanks: India’s Coca Cola factory could diminish our natural water sources:Devananda
EPDP leader Parliamentarian Douglas Devananda yesterday, stated that the Coca Cola factory proposed to be established in Sri Lanka would further reduce the island's already diminishing natural water sources and queried as to what the Government plans to avert a serious crisis.
MP Devananda made this observation yesterday, in a special statement under Standing Order 23/2.He also said that the Coca Cola Company was attempting to set up its largest manufacturing plant in the South Asian region in Sri Lanka to supply to its largest market in the region which is India.
MP Devananda said that currently the Coca Cola was facing serious criticism in India.
He added that there were around 57 coca cola plants in India and they criticized the Indian legal system for the violation of the water usage limits. He also said due to the severe drought in India, their courts had banned the company from using water from the Thamirabarani River.
He added that under such a situation, the Coca Cola Company was planning to set up its manufacturing plant in Sri Lanka and use our water sources.
He further said that although the company would bring in profits from foreign exchange and numerous employment opportunities, the damage that could be done to the islands water sources would be tremendous.
MP Devananda also said that Sri Lanka was also facing a serious drought.
"However Coca Cola wanted to use our water resources to meet the market demands of their largest consumer market in the region," MP Devananda said. "How could we permit this, he queried.”
