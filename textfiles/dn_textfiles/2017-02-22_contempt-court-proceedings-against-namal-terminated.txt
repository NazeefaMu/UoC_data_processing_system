Contempt of Court proceedings against Namal terminated

The Supreme Court yesterday decided to terminate Contempt of Court proceedings filed against Hambantota District Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa following his undertaking that he would cooperate with the investigations carried out by Bribery Commission.
MP Namal Rajapaksa gave this undertaking when the Contempt of Court action filed by Bribery Commission that he had allegedly disrespected the authority of the Bribery Commission by failing to appear before the Commission without reasonable cause was taken up for mention.
Expressing the opinion of the Bribery Commission, Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Rajaratnam with Deputy Solicitor General Nerin Pulle informed Court that Namal Rajapaksa had given statements to the Bribery Commission on February 15 and 20. They requested Court to make an appropriate order.
Therefore, the Supreme Court three-judge-bench comprising Chief Justice K. Sripavan, Justice Priyasath Dep and Justice Buwaneka Aluvihare decided to terminate Contempt of Court proceedings against Namal Rajapaksa and further ordered him to cooperate with the ongoing investigations. A charge sheet filed by Bribery Commission against Namal Rajapaksa was readout in the Supreme Court on a previous occasion. However, MP Namal Rajapaksa, the elder son of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa pleaded not guilty to the charges when the charges filed against him were read out by the Registrar of the Supreme Court. On a previous occasion, the SC served a charge sheet on Hambantota District MP Namal Rajapaksa regarding the complaint.
The former CIABOC Director General had filed a complaint in the SC against MP Namal Rajapaksa for allegedly disrespecting the authority of the Bribery Commission by failing to appear before the Commission without reasonable cause and failing to produce an affidavit in connection with an investigation on the assets of the MP.
In her complaint, former CIABOC Director General Dilrukshi Dias Wickremasinghe PC requested the Supreme Court that proceedings against NamalRajapaksa be initiated for the offence of Contempt under Article 105(3) of the constitution.
The complainant maintained that the CIABOC commenced an investigation on the assets of Rajapaksa which would be an indictable offence under Section 23 of the Bribery Act, if the investigation reveals evidence to substantiate an offence of bribery. The complainant stated that as part of a routine investigation step and for the purpose of ascertaining the truth of the matter being investigated, respondent Namal Rajapaksa was required by notice December 14, 2015 to produce an affidavit by January 20, 2016 under section 5(1)(g) of the CIABOC.
Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Rajaratnam with Deputy Solicitor General Nerin Pulle appeared for the CIABOC.
