‘SL Economic Summit 2017’to build global competitiveness

The upcoming ‘Sri Lanka Economic Summit 2017’ organized by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce will conduct a dedicated thematic session to discuss how important it is for the Lankan manufacturing sector to become competitive to attract global markets.
The session titled, ‘Realizing New Competitiveness in Sri Lankan Manufacturing’, will line up some of the finest industry practitioners to share insights on how local manufacturers can transform to become globally competitive.
Kushan Kodituwakku, Founder and Managing Director of Orel Corporation and Arun Miranda, Chairman/Managing Director of Astrotech Steels (Pvt.) Ltd. and Managing Director of Trinity Steels (Pvt.) Ltd.” will deliver keynote presentations at the session.
The two speeches would be followed by a panel discussion with the participation of industry veterans such as Dr. Mahesha Ranasoma, Managing Director, Dipped Products PLC, Suresh Shah, Director and CEO, Lion Brewery (Ceylon) PLC and Sean Van Dort, Director - Logistics, MAS Holdings.
The session would be moderated by Deshal De Mel, Head of Business Development, Hayleys Global Beverages.
They will discuss the latest global trends in best manufacturing practices, critical bottlenecks faced by local manufacturers that need immediate tackling, where the process should begin and also local success stories in niches like carbon black and high-value apparels.
The all-important session takes place at a moment when Lankan manufacturers are facing severe pressure from rising costs in input materials, labor and energy costs.
Moreover the import protection that has crept in over the years, while helping some industries to survive and grow, is hurting others due to higher intermediate input costs.
The two-day annual summit will take place on July 25 and 26, 2017, at the Cinnamon Grand Hotel, Colombo under the title ‘Execute – Transform - Realize’.
Sunshine Holdings PLC comes in as the Platinum Sponsor of the event, Standard Chartered Bank is the Gold Sponsor, Fonterra Brands, the Silver Sponsor and Dialog Axiata the Telecommunications Partner of the event. Janashakthi Insurance, Prima Group, and Nestle Lanka join in as the strategic partners. OMD of OmniCom MediaGroup is the Communications Partner. Those interested can email [email protected].
