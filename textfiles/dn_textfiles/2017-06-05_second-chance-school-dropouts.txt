Second chance for school dropouts

What can be done for young students who drop out of the education system without a single major certificate to their name? Do we have a comprehensive plan for fighting against student dropout?
According Jayasinghe Weerakkodi, a prominent social worker who heads the Sri Lanka National Social Service and Youth of Education organisations, currently, there is no proper plan to both, identifing school dropouts and fighting against it.
According to Weerakkodi, high dropout rates beget social and economic woes for communities. Dropouts are far more likely to become unemployed, commit crimes and become incarcerated.
Weerakkodi, who conducts student motivational workshops and lectures in chosen schools throughout the country as one of his social service programmes says student dropouts in Sri Lanka mainly occur either at grade eight or after failing the ordinary level exam.
He believes students without at least the Ordinary Level certificate will struggle to find viable employment and is more likely to become a social misfit.
“We need to give the admirable idea of a second chance its full place in our system. The obtainment of a qualification is the best way of combating unemployment,” he said.
With this in mind, Weerakkodi has embarked on a new mission, which is to help students who drop out of school after failing their ordinary level exam. Weerakkodi believes a fresh start and a new school, coupled with proper remedial work for their issues, will help such students to get back on track.
He has identified several such students and currently gives them shelter, food, education material and other support free of charge. He also has arranged a new School in Gonapola area in Horana for them to sit for OL’s again
Shenal, who hails from the Gampaha area, is one such student. He had refused to go back to school after failing at the OL’s. Shenal, who belongs to a well-to-do family, believed he should try his luck at business instead.
“Weerakkodi sir spoke to me over skype for about 5 hours. Finally, he convinced me that I should pursue education again. I was quite demoralized after failing OL’s. Sir came to my house and spoke with my parents and they agreed. So now, I am studying at the Weediyagoda Maha Vidyalaya in Gonapola and preparing for OL’s again. Being in the company of several others like me and the support Weerakkodi sir gives has given me confidence,” said Shenal.
Kosala from the former war-ravaged Welioya in the north, is another student whom Weerakkodi has given safe shelter and education to. Kosala had been identified by Weerakkodi during one his motivational lectures at the Welioya School which Kosala formerly attended.
Kosala was dejected after failing OL’s and had decided to end his school-going as he believed he did not have the knowledge or capability to do it.
“I had no desire to go to School again, but one day, Weerakkodi sir came to our School. He conducted a lecture and later singled me out and spoke to me alone as well. He encouraged me to do OL’s again. So I came to Gonapola with my parents consent. I am enjoying studying with my friends here. I also want to do my AL’s here and Weerakkodi sir has told me he will help,” said Kosala.
Meanwhile, Lakmal from Udugampola became a Buddhist monk at an early age. He had first ended his education at grade 2. He also had later given up robes. His attempts to make a comeback to school also had failed.
"That is when I met Weerakkodi sir. He spoke to my grandmother. He encouraged me to go back to school. So I came to Gonapola with him and I am preparing for OL’s. I am confident of doing well. Shenal and Kosla are also helping me," said Lakmal.
According to Lakmal, the students under Weerakkodi work on daily time table and they have targets. They are also free to play, engage in extra-curricular activities and meet relatives and parents. But discipline is also a key factor and those who step out of boundaries are not tolerated. He also encourage students under his tutelage to live independently.
Weerakkodi only has a few students currently. He spends his own money, as well as those of the well wishers to carry out the programme. He expects to extend his programme in the future and encompass more deserving and needy students.
"When it comes to School drop-outs, my oganisation is striving to deal with prevention, re-entry education and remedial work. My main objective is giving young people a new chance to succeed in education," Weerakkodi said.
