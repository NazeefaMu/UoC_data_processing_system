Procurement Authority finds foul play by tender board :Sugathadasa track re-laying tender cancelled

The tender for re-laying of the Sugathadasa synthetic running track has been cancelled by the Procurement Authority after considering the appeal made by a group of rejected tender applicants. The appeal stated that the Sports Ministry tender board has acted partially in favour of the approved candidate and the Procurement Authority has confirmed that the approved company has not fulfilled the required standards and the approval is illegal.
According to the sources violation of tender procedure by the tender board and other controversial issues have been the fundamentals of Procurement Authority’s recommendation to cancel the tender approval.
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara pledged his support to the Procurement Authority’s decision, but said he has to present the recommendations to the Cabinet for its consent.
To re-do the tender procedure will take at least six more months and the Sports Minister said that he will make arrangements to minimize the inconvenience to athletes during this period.
The athletic pools for Asian Junior Athletics Championship and World Athletic Championship must be selected before April 28 and the Sports Minister said that he will try to make arrangements to complete the track before May. He also said that he will change the tender board to evade such incidents in the future.
The tender approval was criticized on many allegations among them that the favoured company was categorized as a C3 company which is only allowed to apply for projects below Rs. 300 million whereas this is a Rs. 350 million project.
