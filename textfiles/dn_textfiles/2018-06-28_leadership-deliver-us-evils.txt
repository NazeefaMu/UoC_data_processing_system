LEADERSHIP TO DELIVER  US FROM EVILS

The widespread wrongdoing and evil in the political culture, the public service in the social and community life has brought on a repellant degeneracy to our society. All are aware that deception and lying are evil, stealing is evil, murder, adultery and fornication are evil; betrayal and treachery, fraudulence, bribery and corruption are evil; hate speech, denigrating and threatening other persons or a community is evil; insulting, intimidating and invading another’s person is evil; racialism, fanaticism and bigotry are evil. Conceit, arrogance, instigating social disorder, discord and law-breaking with impunity are evil. And all these evils in the personal and communitarian life of the people and their leaders are incompatible with the genuine doctrines of the religions and their followers’ supposed faithful and coherent adherence to them.
PEOPLE OUTRAGED BY SHIRKERS
Widespread public wrongdoing in society by a comparatively few miscreants makes the many ordinary law abiding citizens almost desperate because such unlawful activity cause dismay and bring confusion and chaos upon their lives. When the agencies of law and order are made to remain ineffective, they add insult to injury. The people wonder whether Sri Lanka as a nation would be ever capable of ordering our national communitarian life in a disciplined manner of a civilized people even nearly a decade after a thirty-year civil war the traumatic and sad experiences of which should have brought the people and their leaders to their senses.
Indeed many human beings are afflicted with these and various other kinds of evil. These evils are there in fluctuating intensity and overshadow the lives of all people and harm others in varying degrees consciously or unconsciously. People often fail to discern these evils in their own lives even though they do not miss noticing them in others.
However when these evils are glaringly visible especially in prominent personalities in politics their harmful effects on human dignity, human rights and well-being of people in society cause agony and annoyance. When in the face of the occurrence of these evils subtle excuses are made and the evils of dodging, skirting and shirking public issues without squarely facing national questions are resorted to, the public is outraged and great harm is done to all.
SELF-EXAMINATION PRECEDES REFORM
The issues that have estranged the people and need to be settled are well known. Those who do not have the strength of character are reluctant to diagnose and identify the fangs of these evils in their own lives. Nor could they put right the disorder in the minds, the emotions and the understanding of their colleagues. Pride, narcissism, fear and self-absorption together prevent the acknowledgement of evils and guilt. Though we are often called to sanity by thoughtfulness, reflection, understanding, insight and knowledge, we seem to be reluctant and/or unaided to grow to or recover our better self. Many are hesitant though not incapable of recognizing the demonic within themselves. To do that humility is necessary. With humility one embarks on self examination. That is the first step to abandoning evil ways of behaviour that lead to repentance preceding self-reform which brings on a spirit of benevolence, magnanimity and generosity.
A just and righteous person is not self-centred; he is a man for others. When a just and upright leader and, in our context, a group of like-minded individuals – a captain and a team – is genuinely intent on freeing the people, their fellow citizens, from the many shackles of injustice and unfairness that enchain and demean them, they should not be enticed and tempted by the power, perks and wealth to be acquired and secured to possess it exclusively for themselves. They should not prioritize their spouses and children, relatives and friends
These are indeed the life-forces of a civilized and cultured people. Civilization and culture are not merely in vestiges in archaeological sites and venerable doctrinal documents but imbued in the hearts and minds of living people. A civilized cultured people are conscious of the humane values which constantly operate in their lives and enrich them due to their thoughtful, meditative, prayerful and meek sub-consciousness of them. When this capacity in opportune circumstances suddenly erupt and activate the lives of people, they come alive with a new vision of life full of spiritual vigour and humane energy and amicable solidarity.
RULERS, DON’T SOW DISCONTENT
A respected economist who adorned the public service is remembered today in honour due to his remarkable sagacity and his humility. Quite unlike are some of the people sitting in high places holding responsible positions, wielding power and influence who are lacking in both of these qualities; when they let their pride, arrogance and egoism dominate and let the evil of their manifest flaws overflow on to society, they cause irreparable harm not only to themselves and others but also to institutions and structures of law and order which they manipulate selfishly to advance their narrow purposes and perpetuate their tunnel vision thereby causing social evils. This is currently happening in Sri Lanka today.
When a righteous person and a loyal team gives leadership to any society or community, there is order, harmony in relationships and the people are content. They find meaning and purpose in life. When a wicked person, a tyrant rules there is discontent and sadness and the people groan. Today among us there is much that is not considered right with those who have governed in the past and some of those who govern presently and much that is debase in the way things have been and are administered.
A UNIFIER NOT A DIVIDER
A just and righteous person is not self-centred; he is a man for others. When a just and upright leader and, in our context, a group of like-minded individuals – a captain and a team – is genuinely intent on freeing the people, their fellow citizens, from the many shackles of injustice and unfairness that enchain and demean them, they should not be enticed and tempted by the power, perks and wealth to be acquired and secured to possess it exclusively for themselves.
They should not prioritize their spouses and children, relatives and friends. Like Moses of old who led his people from slavery to freedom and human solidarity, on an occasion opposing his own brother who misled the people, true leaders uphold the law, despise privileges, favoured positions and riches and prefer to share the afflictions and the abject condition of their people, suffer with them and set out to liberate them. (Cf. Biblical Letter to the Hebrews, Ch 11 vv 24-26).
Jesus Christ, in a parable on talents, referred to public service as a reward bestowed on faithful servants who were appointed to rule the people. (Gospel of Luke, Ch. 19).
The prominent people who present themselves to us their fellow citizens as their prospective leaders are focused on a praiseworthy project if they could come before the people as genuine servants who are sincere in their commitment to public service. They should come forward not to take revenge but to restore justice, not to assure security and satisfaction to a majority, even the majority that elect them, at the expense of a minority, but to restore the bonds of national solidarity, peace and unity and the contentment of all the citizens in the pleasantly multifaceted pluralist national community in Sri Lanka enriched by her rich cultural heritage and traditions.
For support they should not appeal to baser feelings of rivalry, tribalism and clannish ideologies but to the genuine good sense and feelings of fraternity among the people, unifying them, not dividing them on biases and superficial values that go against democratic principles.
True patriotism embraces all the citizens of the country in a spirit of sharing, mutual forgiveness where needed and islandwide solidarity. We need a leader and a team free of prejudice and partiality who will deliver us from the social evils that afflict our country and give us hope of a brighter tomorrow.
