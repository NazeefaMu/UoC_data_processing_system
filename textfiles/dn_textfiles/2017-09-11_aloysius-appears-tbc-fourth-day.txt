Aloysius appears before TBC for fourth day

Perpetual Treasuries Limited owner Arjun Aloysius appeared at the Treasury Bond Commission to give statements to Criminal Investigation Department officers for the fourth consecutive day yesterday.
Aloysius arrived at the Treasury Bond Commission around 10 in the morning. He left the premises three hours later.
Recording statements from Aloysius was to be concluded by Sunday.
Aloysius received 48 hours from conclusion of statement to the CID to provide an affidavit to the Presidential Commission of Inquiry Investigating into the Treasury Bond Issue.
Aloysius’s lawyer objected summoning his client to testify before the commission on the basis of compellability. President’s Counsel Anuja Premaratne said they would make a formal submission objecting Aloysius giving evidence before the PCoI, today.
