Sri Lanka Tourism  deepens its reach in Germany

Sri Lanka Tourism conducted B2B (business to business) meetings in four German cities starting from September 12-15.
This tourism promotional activity provides an opportunity to position Sri Lanka as a preferred destination in Asia. The travel and leisure industry of Sri Lanka serving the German market met with potential German outbound tour operators across Germany to establish new partnerships.
Sri Lanka has been a favorable long haul destination among German travelers for the last few decades.
Jürgen Becker of BCD Travel in Cologne said that after travelling to Sri Lanka in the 1980s he was quite excited to go back next year and explore the changes in the country. After his experience back then, he recommends a visit Sri Lanka, nevertheless. The European market continues to remain important to Sri Lanka as Europeans are high spenders with a longer duration of stay.
The roadshow kicked off in Cologne on September12 and continued till September 15, covering Dortmund, Hannover and Bremen too. This further widens the reach in Germany after the series of roadshows conducted nearly a year ago, which included Munich, Stuttgart, Frankfurt, Dusseldorf, Hamburg and Berlin.
Karunasena Hettiarachchi, Sri Lanka Ambassador in Germany, Honorary Consul General of Consulate of Sri Lanka in Cologne and Dortmund addressed the audience and shared the vision of tourism, the long-standing relationship between the two governments and the strong democracy of Sri Lanka.
The destination promotional presentation made by Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau Managing Director Sutheash Balasubramaniam highlighted the diversity, authenticity and compactness to position Sri Lanka in the minds of German participants as a unique destination in Asia.
Jessica Weyers of Reisebüro Weyers said, “It is really an alternative for those who already know the Caribbean Islands and South East Asia and the most important thing is that it is suitable for all ages.
"These positive endorsements from the participants highlight the potential which Sri Lanka has as a leading tourist destination which contributes immensely to the growth of the tourism sector.
