Wildlife fails, angry mob kills leopard  in Kilinochchi

A group of villagers captured and killed a leopard after it had reportedly attacked and injured nearly10 people at Ambakulam, Kilinochchi yesterday.
Our reporters said villagers had informed Wildlife Officers after the leopard had attacked several people earlier and efforts to capture it had failed previously.
It is said that the leopard had attacked and injured a man looking after cattle yesterday after which the villagers had again informed the Wildlife Officers.
However villagers had later begun a hunt for the leopard which had attacked one of the hunting group prompting a retaliation which ended with villagers killing the leopard.
Several people had been admitted to Kilinochchi hospital with injuries which according to Police had been sustained due to the leopard attack .
A video of men killing the leopard went viral on social media which prompted condemnation by animal welfare activists with a question mark on the role played by the Wildlife officers whom according to our reporters were lethargic and late on acting on the complaints of the villagers.
