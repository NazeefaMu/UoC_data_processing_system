Duvindu Silva, a star cricketer in the making

Duvindu Silva is a 12-year-old budding cricketer who showed great promise at tender age. But not like for many young cricketers, Duvindu’s school, Maharagama Highland School does not included cricket in their sports activities. Duvindu’s passion for cricket guided his parents to enter him to the Sanath Jayasuriya Cricket Academy. His talent as an all-rounder was identified there and bestowed the captaincy of academy’s under-13 team while making him the team’s opening batsman.
He toured with the team to several regional countries such as Malaysia and India where his credentials were highly praised by foreign media. Duvindu is a stylish right hand batsman with a high technical accuracy. His best batting performance was against under-17 Anuradhapura district schools united team where he scored 120 runs remaining in the wicket from opener to the last man. The twelve-year lad hammered all the elderly opponent bowlers with no mercy in his superb knock. He bowled best against touring Brisbane Cricket Academy under 14 team with his venomous off-spine bowling spell to capture 6/24.
Duvindu excelled at the annual inter-house cricket tournament of the academy and guided the Balck Cats team to U-13 title under his captaincy. With no other cricket practices than the two-hour weekly session at the Sanath Jayasuriya Cricket Academy, Duvindu has proven his potential in the sport of gentlemen. But he badly need a cricket playing school to continue his cricket career. Duvindu appreciates the support he receive from the Academy’s coaches, his personal coach Chamara Guruge, his parents, Mahendra Kumara and Chamari Siddhisena. He also thanked his only brother Pasindu Silva for all the encouragement.
