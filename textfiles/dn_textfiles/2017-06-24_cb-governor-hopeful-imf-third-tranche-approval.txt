CB Governor hopeful of IMF third tranche approval

Central Bank Governor Dr.Indrajit Coomaraswamy expected the third tranche of the IMF US$ 1.5 billion 3-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) to be approved once the new Inland Revenue Bill is tabled in Parliament.
The new Inland Revenue Bill was gazetted on 19 June and can be tabled in Parliament after 10 working days.
“There is only one prior action that needs be completed and that is the tabling of the new Inland Revenue Bill in Parliament. After that we satisfy all requirements”, said the Governor addressing the media at the Central Bank yesterday.
He further explained that the IMF board was expected to meet during the second week of July and the expectation was that it would be approved then. The IMF thus far has released two tranches of USD 168 million each and the third tranche of USD 168 was expected by April 20. The Governor however noted that the IMF did not require that the government to enact the Bill into legislation as a prior action to receive the tranche,
“The government has committed to several prior actions and one of it is to only table it in Parliament; not pass it.
The IMF understands that as a sovereign country we have every right to decide what the Inland Revenue Bill should look like and they will understand that there will be a debate and various steps that are associated with legal enactments of legislation,”Dr. Coomaraswamy added.
