New OPD complex at National Hospital

A new OPD complex with 22 floors will be set up replacing the old OPD of the National Hospital of Sri Lanka. Nine floors will be a grant from the Chinese Government, while the rest will be built with funds provided by China under a soft loan, Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Speaking at the 25th anniversary celebrations of the Accident Ward at the NHSL yesterday, he said the new OPD complex of the NHSL will be constructed in two phases.
China will also provide a new Cardiology Unit of the 13th floor to Sri Lanka, he said.
Dr. Senaratne said approval has been granted to a Cabinet paper presented to pay compensation for the people who moved away from the land where the new Cardiology Unit is to be set up.
The Chinese government will provide all the funds next year. There will be a significant development in the free health service within the next two or three years, he said.
Dr. Senaratne said NHSL is the world's second largest hospital.
"It has 4,500 beds. The hospital stands ahead of all the other similar hospitals in the region and it is because of the dedication of the health staff. I received treatment from the accident ward after the Thotalanga bomb explosion which killed many leading politicians," he added.
The Colombo National Hospital Accident Ward was a grant by Finland in 1991 under the FINDA Project. The ward completes 25 next year.
