A Magisterial order was issued to Colombo National Hospital Director, Dr. Anil Jasinghe today (13) to submit a medical record of Former MP Duminda Silva on February 28.
Colombo Additional Magistrate Aruni Artigala ordered the medical report to be recommended by a board of medical experts.
The Colombo Additional Magistrate also ordered the Superintendent of Welikada Prison to produce the former Parliamentarian before the panel of medical experts to be examined.
The Welikada Prison Superintendent was previously ordered to produce former MP Duminda Silva before a neurologist attached to the Colombo National Hospital to obtain a medical report.
However, Colombo Chief Medical Officer Ajith Thennakoon had consistently ordered the reports to be obtained from a panel of medical experts representing neurology, physical health and psychiatric.
The prison authorities failed to present the former Parliamentarian, alleged for three corruption cases filed by the Bribery Commission before Courts today.
Previously, the Prison officials informed courts that Duminda Silva was not fit enough be brought before courts even by wheelchair.
However Former MP Duminda Silva was brought to the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Courts in an ambulance on January 5, by prison authorities.
The Bribery Commission alleged former Parliamentarian for failing to declare his assets and liabilities in accordance with the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law No.1 of 1975, for a period of three years since 2011 to 2013.
Former MP Duminda Silva was sentenced to death on September 8, 2016 by the Colombo High Court for murdering four people including former MP Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra On October 8, 2011 and is now serving a sentence of imprisonment in the Welikada Prison.
When observing this case, the defence counsel appearing on behalf of former MP informed Colombo Additional Magistrate Aruni Artigala that his client was willing to plead guilty if the court would impose only a fine.
The Bribery Commission officials told Court that according to Assets and Liabilities Law, the Court has jurisdiction to impose a fine of Rs.1000 with a year’s jail term for an individual condemned guilty of charges.
Subsequently, defence counsel informed the Court that his client will not pledge guilty to the charges against him, instead will move for a trial.
Assistant Legal Director of Bribery Commission, Thushari Dayaratne appeared on behalf of the prosecution.
 Defence counsel Anuja Premaratne appeared on behalf of Former MP Duminda Silva.
The Bribery Commission named the Deputy Secretary General of Parliament P.M.Neil Parakrama and several others as witnesses for these cases.
