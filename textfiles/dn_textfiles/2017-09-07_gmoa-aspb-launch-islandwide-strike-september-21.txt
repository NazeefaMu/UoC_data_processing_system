GMOA, ASPB to launch islandwide strike on September 21

 
A joint islandwide strike will be launched by the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) along with the Anti-SAITM People's Barricade (ASPB) on September 21 if the Government fails to offer a real solution to the SAITM issue, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA headquarters in Colombo today he said that the GMOA along with the anti SAITM organization requested the President and the Prime Minister to offer a practical solution for the SAITM issue that is acceptable to the entire country and not only to Dr. Neville Fernando.  
According to Aluthge, the GMOA received information that a `committee' will be appointed to regulate medical education.
"This task belongs to the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC). If anyone tries to interfere with the independence of the SLMC, the GMOA will give an answer for any such future attempt", he said.  
"The Anti-SAITM vehicle parade will commence on September 12 until 14. The parade will reach Colombo on September 15. The entire Colombo city will be blocked and all activities will be disrupted", Aluthge assured.
"The Government should not let this to happen and solve the SAITM issue immediately. The report of the Committee to be released on September 10 and it is good if the committee members realize the public opinion on the SAITM issue before releasing their report", he added.
