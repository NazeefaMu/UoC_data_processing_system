SLSCA files objections against St. Sebastian’s Katuneriya

The Sri Lanka School Cricket Association (SLSCA) has informed the Colombo District Courts that the decision to suspend St Sebastian College Katuneriya from the inter school under 19 Division II cricket tournament was taken after it was revealed that the school has fielded a student in their team who did not have stipulated qualification to remain in the school as a student.
In filing statements of objections Dilshan de Silva, the Secretary of Sri Lanka School Cricket Association (SLSCA) who is named as a defendant among others submitted to the District Court of Colombo that, the plaintiff’s school St. Sebastian’s College Katuneriya was disqualified upon being revealed that its captain was not eligible to be named as a player, as he was not a student of the college.
The said captain had not been registered to sit for the GCE O/L examination in December 2017 from the school and that the principal of the school had in writing confirmed same, whilst stating that the said school cricketer had not at all registered.
The SLSCA has informed courts that the Principal of St. Sebastian’s College Katuneriya is also a member of the SLSCA Executive committee and he is aware of the inquiry conducted against the college cricket team by the Association. The students have filed the case against only eleven members of the Executive committee where the full membership exceeds 100.
Previously the District Court of Colombo had issued an enjoining order preventing the SLSCA from relegating to Division (III), disqualifying them for awards and as well as taking disciplinary actions against the said team.. The said defendant further submitted to the courts that, proper representative order had not been obtained as envisaged by law and further that as per the reveal that stated above the said team had already been disqualified as per the tournament rule and that further disciplinary actions if any would be taken by the disciplinary committee of the said association.
And further it was submitted that plaintiffs are being only 7 members of such team have no locus standi to bring this action and as such the action is misconceived in law. The other defendants moved time to file their respective written objections and the court whilst granting permission same extended the enjoining order already issued until the next date.
Next hearing will take place on the 13 July 2018.
Chandana Liyanapatabendy President’s Counsel with Sepala Rathnayake and Harshana Ranasinghe Attorneys-at-Law appeared for the defendants instructed by Mr. Chandrakumar De Silva Attorney-at-Law. . Hilary Livera appeared for the plaintiffs.
