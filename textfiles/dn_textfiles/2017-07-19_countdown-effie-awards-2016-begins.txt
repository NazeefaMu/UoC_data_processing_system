Countdown to Effie Awards 2016 begins

The momentous day when the winners of the prestigious Effies Awards 2016 will be announced is getting closer and there’s anticipation as the advertising industry waits for the results.
Effie Awards are recognized as the global symbol of marketing communication effectiveness.
Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM) has the franchise to hold the award ceremony in Sri Lanka and this will be the tenth year they will be conducting the event.
SLIM President Illangovan Karthik said “We are very excited about conducting this much celebrated and highly prestigious award ceremony which promises to be exceptional this year with far more entries than ever before which clearly demonstrates its rapidly increasing importance in the advertising industry. SLIM will conclude a decade of holding the Effie Award and this gives us tremendous pride.”
Imal Fonseka, an iconic figure in Sri Lanka’s marketing industry is the head of the jury panel this year. Explaining how Effies selects the judging panel, he said“the organizers intend to garner the collective wisdom of diverse specialties. This allows for debate and critique and finally fair, educated evaluation and scoring of the submissions.” Explaining the stringent process of judging entries for the coveted Effies Awards, Fonseka said: “Each juror independently scores the entries in round one based on the stated criteria. Scores are tabulated and cutoff points are established by the Head of Jury. Entries are shortlisted based on this score. A similar process is followed in round two. However, each juror may bring in pertinent observations to the table before scoring.”
According to Fonseka, the jury goes through a very stringent procedure when picking a winning entry.
“The jury will look for a liner thought that links the four key criteria for evaluation which are - if the challenge and objective is clear and there’s some really smart bit of strategic thinking involved."
