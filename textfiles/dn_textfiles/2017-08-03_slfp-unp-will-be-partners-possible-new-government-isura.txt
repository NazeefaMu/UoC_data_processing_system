SLFP, UNP will be partners of possible new government: Isura

The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and the United National Party (UNP) will be the major partners of a possible new government formation as both parties possess equal powers and authority, Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya said.
Addressing the media at the Western Provincial Council Auditorium yesterday, he said President Maithripala Sirisena would not provide opportunities for the rise of terrorism.
The chief minister said credit should go to President Maithripala Sirisena for protecting War Heroes when they had been alleged for violating human rights during the previous regime.
Devapriya said, “We have ended the war. Yet, it is not possible to eradicate terrorism since there can be people with extremist ideas. We may come across various groups of people who try to make the country unstable to satisfy their narrow needs. The government will take precautionary measures to prevent disruptive issues.”
He said the President would not support any activity that negatively affects to the unity of the country. The chief minister said the Hambantota port was leased out to China with an agreement which had vested the powers to amend the agreement at any time.
