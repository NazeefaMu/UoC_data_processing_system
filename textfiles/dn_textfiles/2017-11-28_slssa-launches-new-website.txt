SLSSA launches new website

Sri Lanka Ship Suppliers Association (SLSSA) launched a new website to promote their activities after their annual general meeting last Friday.
'We stand at a crucial point in time for our Industry in a situation where Sri Lanka is gradually moving towards realizing its potential as a Maritime Hub, this brings with it many opportunities as well as unique challenges', said the President elect, Oshan Fernando.
To exploit these opportunities, I firmly believe we need to keep evolving as Ship Suppliers in facing the challenges we face in the local and global landscape and together as members of the Ship Supply Association, we should aim to utilize our combined strength, knowledge and vision to our advantage.
During the year ahead, we hope to explore several areas in assisting our members in facing the international challenges, he said.
In strengthening our own capabilities, the Association will aim to explore how we can better utilize our combined strengths, primarily in infrastructure, storage and logistics toward the betterment of all our members where we can maximize underutilized resources.
Further, we aim to equip our members towards competing at an international level with rival supply hubs in the region and internationally. We aim to accomplish this through a programme involving facilitating our members’ participation in International conferences informing our members of the benefits of our association with SLSSA and its network of 2,000 Ship suppliers and links with multiple important representatives in the Global Maritime sphere and promoting international quality standards to our members.
“I would like to take a moment to expand on one aspect in particular: our commitment to international quality standards, we firmly believe it is of paramount importance that our Members adopt international Quality Standards which have become mandatory in competing internationally.”
To this end, the SLSSA aims to provide awareness of the benefits of these standards, guidance toward obtaining the certifications, and obtaining concessionary rates from Standards Awarding Bodies for SLSSA members. (SS)
