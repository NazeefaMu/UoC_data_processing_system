Govt taxing the ordinary to please IMF - Dinesh

 
MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena yesterday said in Parliament that the government was imposing more taxes on the ordinary people while curtailing their relief measures to satisfy the IMF.
He was participating in the adjournment motion moved by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayaka on the economic situation of the country.
Gunawardena said the government was planning to bring in a Contingency Bill to manage the EPF and ETF as of a condition laid by the IMF and added that the Bill would affect the people negatively. He said the IMF had also asked to privatize the three state banks. The parliamentarian asked whether the government agrees to these conditions.
MP Gunawardena said the first grant of the IMF loan of USD 1.1billion would not be facilitated if the government does not agree to the conditions laid by the IMF. He said the government is preparing to present a mini-budget to cater to the IMF conditions.
Commenting on the Colombo Port City Project, the MP demanded that the ministers who were vociferous critics of the project should resign from their portfolios, as the Prime Minister is to sign the agreements for the project in his upcoming Chinese tour. Criticising the economic management of the government, the MP asked what had the government done with the USD 2 billion saved from the drop in oil prices in the world market.
