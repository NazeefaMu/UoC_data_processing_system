Govt. to boycott today’s  Parliament session

UPFA MP Bandula Gunawardena said they will boycott from participating in today’s Parliamentary sessions.
He said today’s sessions and its proceedings were unlawful and were being conducted in a manner contradictory to parliamentary protocol.
“It does not make sense for us to gather at a given place, call it Parliament and conduct it the same way. Parliament remains dissolved and we have no intention to participate in it,” he told media at a hurried press briefing yesterday.
