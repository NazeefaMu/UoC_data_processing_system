Vain effort by Vihas

A splendid unbeaten 104 runs by Vihas Kudakuruduwage of Thurstan College, Colombo was of no avail as their inter school under 13 division one tournament cricket match ended in a draw against St. Thomas College, Kotte and played at Colombo.
So far in four outings Vihas has scored 301 runs in four innings. (vs Mahanama College 17, vs Ananda College 96 n/o and vs Bandaranayake, Gampaha 84) at a Bradsmanque average of 150.5. Batting first Thurstanites declared at 269 for 3 runs and Navindu Fernando and Asith Wickramasinghe scoring 58 and an unbeaten 77 runs respectively and at stumps Kottawa Thomians were reeling at 82 for 6. Thurstanites are coached by former Cambrian Nalinda Dissanayake.
