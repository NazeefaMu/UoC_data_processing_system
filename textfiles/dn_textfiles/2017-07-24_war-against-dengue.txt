War against dengue

A nationwide campaign involving tens of thousands of volunteers and security personnel will be launched this week placing the battle against dengue on a war-footing to destroy mosquito breeding grounds in schools.
A four-day intensive clean-up drive will be initiated from Friday when students, parents, teachers and well-wishers will be invited to participate along with health officials and thousands of troops and police, education ministry officials said. Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam has instructed his officials to issue a circular to formally inform all schools about the coordinated effort to ensure that there is no room for mosquito breeding in schools.
“Protecting our children from the dengue epidemic is a responsibility of all of us,” Minister Kariyawasam said.
“No other government has given such priority to tackle the dengue issue,”Kariyawasam said.
“The government has given the highest priority to battling the spread of dengue which has claimed some 290 lives so far this year and infected over 100,000 people, according to official figures.
Nearly half of all dengue cases have been reported from the Western province, the Minister said.
The Health Ministry is also assisting the unprecedented clean-up campaign in schools and asked principals to coordinate with local health authorities for arranging fumigation and other technical help.
President Maitrhripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne spoke over the weekend of the need for concerted action to contain dengue which spread more rapidly this year due to the twin effects of the garbage crisis and floods.
Education Ministry officials said there will be no teaching on Friday, but students could turn up in appropriate clothing to join the clean-up effort that will be supervised and guided by health authorities.
From the beginning of this month, thousands of soldiers, airmen and sailors have supported public health inspectors in a house-to-house campaign to identify mosquito breeding areas and take corrective action.
Army Spokesman Brigadier Roshan Seneviratne said the military had been deployed initially for a three month period to assist the dengue prevention work carried out in line with the advise of the Presidential Task Force on Dengue Control.
Surprise inspection of several schools, including so called prestigious colleges, showed a shocking level mosquito larvae in their compounds and haphazard disposal of rubbish undermining the health of students.
