‘Garment, fisheries sectors need incentives’

The government should give special incentives to the garment and fisheries industries to boost exports, UNP backbench MP S.M. Marikkar said, at a press conference at Sirikotha yesterday.
He proposed the above measures observing that boosting exports is vital to ease the current economic pressures faced by the country.
“Curtailing non-essential imports is necessary, but that alone would not help us to come out of the current situation we are in. We need to strengthen our exports sector and we must earn dollars in all possible ways,” he said.
“We have an import economy. Our export revenue is 20 percent whereas import expenditure is 80 percent. This import economy was created by successive SLFP governments which ruled since 1994. All countries with import economies have faced difficulties, while the countries with export economies have been able to resist the global economic crisis,” he said.
