Gharasarapa Love Vs the Supernatural

In local lore, there are a few ghosts that lurk among us. You can apparently see them if you are unfortunate enough to cross their paths. Among them are Maha Sona, Mana Mohini, Kalu Kumaraya and Reeri Yaka. My grandmother and my father were expert ghost story tellers and kept my brothers, sister and I recoiling in fear late at night. These characters figured prominently in their stories. I have read many stories that incorporated elements from these ghostly characters, but one movie I saw last week convinced me that there are many ways of looking at them.
Black Prince concept
That movie was Gharasarapa (The Lurking Serpent), another innovative outing from renowned director Jayantha Chandrasiri, who wears another hat as a senior journalist. It is a unique take on the legend of the Kalu Kumaraya (Black Prince), who generally possesses female souls. (On the other hand, Mana Mohini likes to invade male souls). Without giving out any spoilers, the story in a nutshell: Vidya and Sandares (played by Kavindya Adhikari and Devnaka Porage) meet on a pilgrimage and their love blossoms. But the Black Prince (Jackson Anthony) wants to claim her heart. However, the Black Prince cannot break through the intense human love between Vidya and Sandares. As often happens with one’s first love, the duo has to go their separate ways, but the Black Prince is everywhere, even when you don’t want him. Our Black Prince is not as bad as he seems to be, as Sandares discovers. You have to see the movie to discover what happens.
Chandrasiri is known for crafting movies that touch on different aspects of our lives. Each Jayantha Chandrasiri is different from the earlier one. While this is not the first time he has tackled supernatural elements on film or television, Gharasarapa is not a horror movie in the conventional sense of the word. It is actually a love story with an all-pervading sense of the supernatural. No one is likely to be scared while watching Gharasarapa which however reminds us that there is a world that we cannot see or explain.
It is a pity though that Jackson Anthony, in the titular role, gets only a little screen time to express his acting prowess. But he exploits his brief appearances to the fullest – there are also voice-only tracks where he does not appear. This is perfectly understandable, given that he is a ghost. Kamal Addaraarachchi excels in his role as the adult Sandares, whose artist wife Frankie (Ameesha Kavindi) is possessed by the Black Prince. Sangetha Weeraratne is the adult Vidya, though she also has a very limited screen time. I though the final scenes where the two adult characters meet sounded contrived – this might sound like a spoiler but Sandares should have been instantly able to identify Vidya even after 37 years if their teenage love was that strong. Nevertheless, your mileage on this scene may vary. You must see the movie to find out how and when the Black Prince comes into the scene here.
Sriyantha Mendis is a good fit for the role of Rev. Fr. Camillus Dabare, who is one of the few people who can “tame” the Black Prince. My only gripe about the cast is that Yashoda Wimaladharma has been totally miscast as an “athuraya” (patient) at a Thovil ceremony – the script should have given her a bigger role, even from a cameo perspective.
undercurrent theme
The movie’s timeline begins in the 1980s. Since the movie’s main protagonists belong to the Sinhala (Sandares) and Tamil (Vidya) communities, they cannot escape the effects of the conflict. Chandrasiri does not portray the horrors of war on-screen, but it is the main undercurrent that drives the movie. At one point, Vidya mentions that her father is fed up of paying ransom to the “Boys”, an euphuism for the Tigers (LTTE) and hence his decision to migrate to Canada. Sandares, of course, has no such inhibitions and yells “Koti” (the Sinhala word for Tigers) loud enough for everyone to hear. Vidya instantly recoils in horror at this very public uttering of the dreaded word. One wishes the movie explored this narrative a bit more, though.
Multi-ethnic storyline
This is a movie for all communities. In fact, at the Roxy (now renamed Savoy Premiere) Wellawatte where I saw the movie, there were members of every community, with a couple of foreigners too in the mix. I want to make two points here. It is a pity that the movie has so far not been subtitled or even dubbed in Tamil for exhibiting in the North and the East, given its multi-ethnic storyline. I am sure it will be well received in those regions. The English subtitling is average, with a few glaring mistakes as well. For example, when Vidya says “mata oyawa nethiwei kiyala bayai”, the subtitle translation is “I am afraid I am going to loose you”, whereas the correct word is “lose”. If the producers wish to do a DVD or Blu-Ray for sale abroad, primarily in countries with a large Sri Lankan Diaspora, they should re-do the subtitles and add a few other Asian and Western languages as well. The film also needs a good English dub using the same cast or even a different voice acting cast if that can be managed.
The producers deserve kudos for maintaining an authentic 80s look during those sequences.
They have been careful not to include any modern vehicles, cell phones etc for that era. For vehicle lovers like me, the well-maintained Volkswagen campervan is another highlight of the movie. The only sore point I noticed was that in one sequence, Vidya is dressed in Jeans, which were not very popular among girls back in 1980.
The cinematography is uniformly excellent. The opening scene of the lorry and VW van “racing” each other has been staged and photographed extremely well. The effects shots too have been done well, though not up to Hollywood standards. But in the context of the film, they do a good job.
The film has been shot digitally as far as I can tell and it shows. Some purists may mourn the absence of film grain, but for me what matters is the story, not the medium. You must see this movie in a cinema with a state-of-the-art projection and sound system to fully appreciate it. The 5.1 surround mix is good but there is room for improvement. Again, if the producers do a Blu-Ray, they should go for a full Dolby Atmos mix (theatre - 64 speakers, home - 12 speakers) that is much more immersive.
There are only two songs in the movie and they are both excellent. “Hema Deyak Pene” is an outstanding song penned by Chandrasiri himself and sung by Samitha Mudunkotuwa (coincidentally, young Vidya – Kavindi Adhikari is her daughter) and Bachi Susan. This song is played on two occasions in different timelines. “Kalu Kumara” the other song, sung by Dumal Warnakulasiriya, features Jackson Anthony on-screen.
Gharasarapa is a must-see movie. Once again, Chandrasiri has delivered an out-of the-box experience to moviegoers. Like every movie, it does have shortcomings and plot holes, but movies are not necessarily about real life. It is a thought-provoking way to spend two hours of your time and your eyes and ears – especially the ears – will thank you for it.
