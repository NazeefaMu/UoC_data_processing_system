Surreal mixture of ballpoint art

After going through a collection of ballpoint art done recently by Chandana Ranaweera, I found that he has improved by leaps and bounds. His recent sketches of Gods, lovers, raban players, drummers, dancers, funny faces of men and women, decorations, waves, houses, trees, shapes and lines, boats and tripods remind me of what Franz Kafka said about Picasso's art.
“Picasso only registers the deformities which have not yet penetrated our consciousness. Art is a mirror which goes ‘fast’ like a watch – sometimes”.
Chandana Ranaweera

Having viewed the paintings of a wide range of Sri Lankan and foreign artists, I feel Chandana belongs to a class of his own. This is because he has not attempted to copy the style of any other artist. He has evolved his own style using only ballpoint pens of different colours. More than a decade ago, I reviewed his exhibition of paintings held in Colombo. At that time I referred to him as a ballpoint artist – pure and simple. However, I find that he has widened his horizon subject-wise and created marvellous pieces of art which appeal more to the brain that to the heart.
Having taught art as a school teacher Chandana devotes his life giving vent to his pent-up feelings. I have not seen any of his water-colour, oil or acrylic paintings. He seems to be wedded to ballpoint pens and paper leaving aside the palette and the brush. An artist needs not necessarily use traditional raw materials such as watercolours, acrylic and oil paint. A creative artist can use a pen, pencil or even a piece of charcoal to give expression to his feelings.
Living away from the bustling city of Colombo, Chandana is not in a position to hold regular exhibitions of his paintings. It does not mean that he should give up his vocation. As a genuine artist, he breaks new ground every time he puts pen to paper. Some of his creations show his inner feelings about art in a fast-changing world where almost everybody is running behind fame and power. His “Hathares Minisa” (Square man) has a touch of Picasso's style. It has been done with a black ballpoint pen reminding the viewer that every man's life is mysterious to a point. He has captured man's suffering too in the painting.
In the painting titled “Vrushaba Maranaya” (The death of a bull) we see to men armed with weapons attacking a defenceless bull with the intention of killing it and selling its flesh. The dumb animal remains helpless. It serves to drive home the point that men and even animals are victims of the immanent will of God. Buddhists may call it kammic forces that drive them from birth to death and beyond.
His painting titled “Pem Yuvala” (Lovers) has its own charm and depth of meaning. The lovers sit very close to each other and they are holding hands. With a few dexterous lines Chandana has recreated the grandeur of human love not tainted with lust. In a world full of lustful activities innocent and true love appears to be something of the past.
The “Sithar Vadakaya” (Sitar Player) sits erect and plays the instrument as if he is in a trance. The sitar is a difficult musical instrument to play and it is used mostly in classical music. The background shows curved lines to depict musical notes that come out of the instrument. It is a beautiful painting to look at.
In another painting titled “Vrushaba Minis Adaraya” (Love between man and bull) we see a man more or less praying to a bull for succour. The man appears to be an innocent villager who has numerous problems. He has no one to tell his story of woes except the bull who appears to listen to him. In a way, the bull symbolizes the authorities who remain deaf and dumb when poor people come to them for relief.
Hopefully, Chandana will do some more creations with his ballpoint pens to enrich art in his retirement.
