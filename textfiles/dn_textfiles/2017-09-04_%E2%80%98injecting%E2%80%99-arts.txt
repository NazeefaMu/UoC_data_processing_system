‘Injecting’ arts !

Nurses say that “nursing is an art,” and 24-year-old Kimberly Joy Magbanua of the Philippines gave another beautiful meaning to that.
Kimberly, who works as a registered nurse in a hospital in the Philippines, is making waves online for her unique artwork that she creates using a syringe.
How she came up with that idea is no surprise: “I started scribbling by using only a pen and paper. I’ve always wanted to try in on canvas, but I needed paint to do it. The idea came up to me two years ago. One time during duty, I was giving meds to my patients, and the idea struck me of using a syringe as my paintbrush.”
It usually takes her three to six hours to finish one, easy as it may sound, it’s a lot more technical than you think: “I remove the needle shaft leaving only a piece of it. I use different needle gauges depending on the details of the painting. Since I’m working with paint, it dries up quickly, and I have to change the needle if it clogs up.”
Kimberly served as a volunteer nurse for two years then worked as a community health nurse for months before landing a job in a government hospital in her hometown as a medical-surgical nurse. When not taking care of patients, she creates another form of art - “syringe art” as what she calls it. You can palpate her passion when she: “Art is my comfort zone. Art feeds my soul.”
An art-lover since she was a child, Kimberly remembers being fascinated by colors and paints: “I remember I have been in-love with colors, paints, and other art stuff since I was in kindergarten. During my elementary years and beyond, I started joining different art contests in our school.”
But it was her parents who nurtured her talent, “When I was a kid, my parents would buy me art supplies instead of toys. Also, during story times, they would read me bedtime stories while doing drawings and doodles of the character and the scene on a piece of paper.”
Faithful to being a nurse, Kimberly performs proper hand hygiene “while singing the Happy Birthday song,” before and after painting with a syringe, she jests. And mind you, she uses clean and unused needles. Bored Panda
