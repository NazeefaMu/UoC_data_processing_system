Best and worst dressed on the IIFA 2017 Green Carpet

The first event of the International Indian Film Academy (IIFA) Awards wrapped in sheer elan and style despite rain playing a major spoilsport on Friday night. The entire Bollywood brigade including Salman Khan, Katrina Kaif, Saif Ali Khan, Alia Bhatt, Varun Dhawan, Dia Mirza walked the green carpet and made heads turn. The award ceremonies are as much about the winners as they are about the style quotient of the film fraternity members.
While IIFA 2017 saw some stunning fashion choices, it also witnessed some disappointing choices. Famed international designers like Ziad Nakad, Zuhair Murad, Gucci, Emporio Armani made their foray on the IIFA traditional green carpet along with some splendid Indian designers like Gauri & Nainika, Swapnil Shinde and Anju Madan. Shining, shimmering and glistening away to glory, the divas were complimented by the dapper dudes and here’s how they looked.
