Milan Maersk to call at Colombo Port

Maersk Line, with a presence in Sri Lanka for more than 25 years, continues to invest in Sri Lanka and contribute to its economy by bringing some of the latest and largest ships to Colombo.
These megaships provide efficiencies and economies of scale to exporters and importers, thereby driving efficiencies in their supply chains. As such, the “Milan ” one of the world’s largest ships, will arrive in Colombo on October 17 at 1200 hrs local time and berth at the Colombo International Container Terminal (CICT) With an overall length of 399 metres and a capacity of 20,568 TEU (twenty-foot equivalent unit) the container vessel is the largest thus far to arrive in Colombo. The megaship belongs to the second generation of Line’s well-known Triple-E class, that is currently setting new standards in container shipping, replacing smaller, less efficient ships on the East-West-trade.
The “Milan ” calls Colombo as part of the AE1 service which is currently the fastest service from Colombo into major North European countries like UK, Netherlands & Germany. It also brings essential imports from China and South East Asia into the Sri Lankan market.
Commenting on this historic moment, Zeeshan R Mukhi, Country Head, Line, Sri Lanka stated “Sri Lanka is a strategic market for & this is a momentous occasion for us as well as the industry as a whole.

It is with this vision, that we are bringing one of our largest ships into the port of Colombo.”
