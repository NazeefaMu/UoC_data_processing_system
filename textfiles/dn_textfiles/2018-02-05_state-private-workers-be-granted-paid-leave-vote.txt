State, private workers to be granted paid leave to vote

The Election Commission has instructed all private sector employers and heads of government firms, to take steps to grant paid leave to their employees who have qualified to cast votes on February 10 for the upcoming local government polls to be held countrywide.
The Election Commission, in a special circular, has informed all secretaries to the ministries, to instruct their department heads accordingly, that it is compulsory that state and private employees should be granted enough time to cast their votes and that time given to them should not be counted for their normal leave entitlements, North Western Province Chief Minister Dharmasiri Dassanayake told the Daily News yesterday in Kurunegala.
