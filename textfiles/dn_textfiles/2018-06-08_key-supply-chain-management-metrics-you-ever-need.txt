Key Supply Chain  Management  Metrics  that you ever need

To make rapid decisions in today’s fast-acting environment, we need smart, time-saving, easy to interpret and most importantly decision-supporting key performance indicators. We have collected the most important supply chain metrics.
Kaizen, Lean and Six Sigma
When looking at business process improvement methodologies like Kaizen, Lean and Six Sigma, it’s very easy to see a lot of similarities. After all, these frameworks aim to make a business as competitive as possible, while striving for top-notch performance, efficiency, effectiveness and reliability. Additionally, all of the three methods employ cycles of gathering data, evaluating it, making practical and quantifiable optimization, and tracking the results. This means that even if you have a previous familiarity with each methodology, it’s easy to spot a lot of similarities and apparent overlaps, especially as one gets buried under an avalanche of buzzwords. On top of this, many of the professionals implementing each methodology might also draw additional inspiration for refinements from other frameworks, which blurs the lines another step further.
While many methods might sound analogous in theory, Kaizen, Lean and Six Sigma have some significant differences that stem from their core values and assumptions about business and improvement in general. To put this in practical terms, the most influential differences between these three methodologies lie in the exact type of metrics each one values the most, and devotes effort to improving. It should come as no surprise that even the slightest changes to the particular metric that importance is placed upon would certainly lead to decisively divergent outcomes and results.
Because of these facts, comparing Kaizen, Lean and Six Sigma can be of great value to a business and its management team, and is an integral part of selecting the best methodology to implement in any given situation.
What is Kaizen
The first of the three approaches to examine is Kaizen. Its name comes from Japanese, and loosely translates to “change for the better”. Broadly speaking, it’s not just a management and business process optimization methodology, but a general philosophy that could be applied to both one’s personal life and a business organization.
The two core beliefs that inform how Kaizen operates are:
1. Everything can be improved
2. Small gradual changes can lead to significant overall and long term improvements
This means that Kaizen can be applied to absolutely anything, and it doesn’t really have a specific type of metric that it favors. It doesn’t usually produce rapid results. However, when applied over a long period of time, it creates a mentality where problems are fixed without a committee or leadership approval for every little change. This leads to more employee engagement and involvement in the process.
What is Lean?
While Kaizen is a very general approach to improvement, Lean is a methodology with a background in manufacturing that focuses on a very specific type of metrics. It’s a framework that is already older than a century, and it was a pivotal part for Henry Ford’s Model T’s success. Obviously, the Lean methodology has evolved over the years, but its main focus has remained the same – eliminating waste in order to free up time to increase value to your customer. The main target of this approach is efficiency across the system (value stream). It has proven quite successful in improving or removing all the inefficient steps of a process that waste time, energy, finance or raw materials. Lean provides a competitive edge since it allows a business to manufacture products or provide services faster and at lower costs. It also is easy to learn, which makes it easy for all employees to be involved in improvements.
What is Six Sigma
While Kaizen and Lean both look at resources and ways to optimize a process, the core goal of Six Sigma is achieving consistent and reliable results. It is primarily focused on improving the quality of the result or outcome of the process. This is why it’s sometimes referred to as a quality assurance methodology, despite the fact that it has been successfully applied beyond just quality improvements.
As far as results go, Six Sigma strives for near perfection, where the process succeeds 99.99966% of the time. To achieve this seemingly impossible result, training and coaching is required in order to learn the tools and framework, modeled after the martial arts belt system. These results lead to lower costs, improved customer satisfaction, and helps drive continuous improvement in order to achieve higher and higher sigma levels.
In an organization undertaking a lean transformation and striving for operational excellence and continuous improvement, leadership’s role is even more critical, since many lean-leader attributes are not taught in business schools, nor are they intuitive. When rolling out an improvement effort, executives are initially excited by the early returns from low-hanging fruit, but many quickly become disenchanted when the pace of improvement weakens or pauses. 
Zero loss thinking
“Zero loss” thinking identifies where to focus your improvement activities. Zero-based thinking is a performance management mind-set in which there is no acceptable level of failure: no off quality, no breakdowns, no delays, no customer complaints, no manufacturing wastes, etc. Through this systematic approach of uncovering root causes of less-than-optimized work streams.
Milliken performance system
Like other business management strategies, such as Six Sigma and lean manufacturing, the Milliken Performance System helps businesses increase productivity, quality, and efficiency. But the Milliken Performance System’s distinction is that it changes the entire business culture by engaging everyone, resulting in long-term, holistic, sustainable improvement.The Milliken Performance System promotes the goal of reducing defects, breakdowns, waste and other abnormalities to almost “zero” as the expected norm. The system is characterized by a foundation of safety and strategic clarity and is supported by 9 pillars which continue to drive Milliken to be a lean enterprise. By implementing the Milliken Performance System, you can dramatically improve your operational performance and employee engagement.
System is built to focus on:
* Properly managing equipment
* Improving associates’ skills and knowledge
* Preventive and predictive maintenance
Six steps of transformation:
* Accommodate, educate, and demonstrate
* Assessment
* Master plan
* Plant implementation plan
* Model within plant
* Replication
Lean Six Sigma in future manufacturing
To hypothesize about the future importance of Lean Six Sigma, we first need to make clear if it has been successful in the past. It has! Numerous high-quality empirical papers—including several of the panel participants—establish that both Lean and Six Sigma have measurable positive benefits on performance. Lean is a powerful system. So why not use it. It claims that “if you have a process, and you have a customer for that process, then Lean applies“. Thus, only when something is produced for the sake of art, Lean has limited or no application.
Second, we need to evaluate whether the manufacturing paradigm will be the same as the one we have today or change radically. It describe, how the Lean Six Sigma we have today, is the result of hundred years of development: Lean comes from the Toyota Production System (TPS), which is based a lot on Ford’s mass production system, which again builds on Frederick Taylor, and so on and so on. Now we have been in the same manufacturing paradigm for a century. So, what will happen when we move to the next manufacturing paradigm—when we seriously start to apply the internet of things, 3D printing, automation, and nano-technologies in manufacturing?
The panel agrees that: “Lean Six Sigma might take new forms, but it will not be abandoned.” A participant in the audience points out that “Lean was defined in the 20thcentury; probably it has to be somewhat redefined for the 21st century”. It suggest that the “value created” should be redefined from the financial measures we use today to sustainability at large. That’s a good suggestion!
Lean Six Sigma—worthy of future research?
Despite the enormous amount of research that has gone into studying improvement programs like Lean and Six Sigma, there is no sign of a declining interest. We know that implementation of Lean Six Sigma is troublesome for many companies, so there is still a need for a better understanding of when and where it applies. Lean Six Sigma is clearly worthy of more research, and the panel suggests a few routes it could take:
The Six Sigma Renaissance
Process standardization and quality improvement had been neglected in the financial service industry for decades. When the manufacturing industry needed to become more efficient and reduce waste, the financial service industry was flourishing and therefore, found itself not in need for major improvement initiatives. When this situation changed, everyone suddenly started to look for a quick fix and Six Sigma, which had already been so successful in the manufacturing industry a method of Quality control, was seen by many as the golden path.
Countless financial services companies have followed this path and have implemented Six Sigma in the last decade. Some have been very successful and happily announce their multi-million dollar savings. However, many others keep very quiet about their returns or have stopped their engagement in Six Sigma all together because they didn’t attain the expected return on their investment. This is reflected in the coverage of Six Sigma in the financial service sector – there is only a handful of books available on the topic, while there are hundreds on the use of Six Sigma in manufacturing.
Why Six Sigma has been so successful in the manufacturing industry, but only worked for a small group of finance firms? More importantly, how can the financial service sector make better use of Six Sigma? Without question, Six Sigma is a well-accepted quality enhancement method which has been applied with great success in the manufacturing industry for decades. However, Six Sigma methods cannot just be transferred from the manufacturing industry to the financial service industry without any changes. Let us review the main strengths and pitfalls of Six Sigma, when transferring it to the financial service industry strengths.
Unique customer focus
Focus on the customer is one of the main strengths of Six Sigma. By linking quality improvement initiatives to customer needs, Six Sigma teams ensure that the improvement has a positive impact on the customer. Particularly in the financial service industry, where the interaction with the customer takes place on a daily basis, customer focus is of utmost importance. When implementing Six Sigma in finance processes, customer needs have to be given highest priority. Short-sighted focus on cost or headcount reduction will not bring the long term benefits Six Sigma promises. Only a close cooperation with customers and a clear focus on customer needs can lead Six Sigma to success in a financial service environment.
2. Six Sigma framework and tool kit
Many financial service organizations have not engaged in structured process improvement until recently. Therefore, they often lack standardized processes, organized quality and engineering departments and a general understanding of what quality improvement means to them. Six Sigma provides, with the grater cycle, a structured framework to guide users throughout the improvement efforts and ensures that the project develops in the desired direction. Additionally, Six Sigma comes with a whole tool kit of brainstorming, analysis and prioritization tools that help to unfold its power. This structured approach, combined with the Six Sigma tools are particularly valuable for teams with a financial service background.
3. Data-driven and statistical methodology
Some may argue that financial service process improvement greatly benefits from its data richness. However, in my experience exactly this data overflow is one of the main problems for successful project selection and completion in this industry. Too many improvement efforts are based on ill selected data and the general assumption that the problem root cause is already known before the project even starts. This causes projects to fail and the improvement efforts to lose their reputation. Six Sigma offers a more statistical approach to measuring and analyzing data, thereby minimizing the risk of quick assumptions and allowing projects to be wisely selected and executed.
Weaknesses:
1. Resistance from people
I experienced that resistance towards change is even greater in the service industry, than in manufacturing. The average white-collar worker seems to be extremely unaware of the waste in his daily work and is, to my surprise, very resistant towards others outlining this waste to him. Now this most likely originates from the fact that processes in the service industry are invisible, following an unwritten process through electronic data exchange and peoples’ heads. Seeing and accepting waste in such a virtual environment is more difficult than in a factory, where bottlenecks and process defaults are physically existing. This resistance leads to many project failures and makes it very difficult to implement Six Sigma.
2. High initial investment and slow return on investment
The financial service industry is famous for its fast-paced culture, striving from one budget to another. However, for anyone looking for short term return on investment, Six Sigma is not the right cure. Six Sigma requires a high level of initial investment for implementation and the first years of Six Sigma introduction into an organization are particularly costly. During this period Six Sigma experts and employees have to be trained or recruited and senior management focus on Six Sigma implementation is required. Additionally, return on investment is often not realized in the short term.
From an organization-wide perspective, achieving a break-even from implementing Six Sigma takes a considerable amount of time as initial investment is high and results from improvements might only become apparent after several months.
Recommendations and Outlook for Six Sigma in Financial Services
Six Sigma is more a culture than it is a methodology. In order to make it work, you have to prepare your whole organization to embrace the values and ideas behind the concept. If you are looking for a quick fix to make the next budget, then Six Sigma is definitely not the right thing for you. The same holds for organizations that have not yet had any or only limited engagement with quality and process improvement. If you still have a lot of low hanging fruits out there, then go for Lean and 5S first.
However, if you are willing to take your organization through a true transformation, to standardize and re-engineer processes and to make a long-term commitment to Six Sigma, then go for it.
Success cases from the financial service industry and many years of successful implementation in the manufacturing industry prove that Six Sigma is indeed a very effective method to bring your organization to the next level.
Both of the weaknesses outlined in this article can, with the right commitment, be reduced to a minimal. Once you have made the initial investment of time, effort and money, Six Sigma will reward you with a very worthy return on your investment.
In my opinion, particularly the ever increasing importance of outsourced finance services brings a never before seen centralization and standardization to financial organizations.
This allows for large scale projects and makes the return on investment more favorable, than implementing Six Sigma in small decentralized offices. The most recent developments in the financial and supply chain industry and the harsh competition following the financial crisis have further strengthened the need for more cost efficient solutions and better quality.
At the same time, many players in the financial service industry have already hit their climax in getting process improvement from Lean. That’s why I predict that Six Sigma will see a renaissance – this time not in manufacturing, but in Supply Chain.
