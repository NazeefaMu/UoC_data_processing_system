Premier promises to renovate ‘Ran Viyana’ of Dalada Maligawa

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said he would take steps to renovate the Kandy Sri Dalada Maligawa 'Ran Viyana' (Golden Canopy) with the approval and advice of the Malwatte and Asgiriya prelates.
He was attending a religious observance held at the Sri Dalada Maligawa yesterday to mark the completion of his 40 years of political life.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said the 'Ran Viyana' gifted by the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa was a little worn off and needing repairs. So he hoped to repair the facility soon with the advice of the two Mahananayke Theras.
It is significant that the 'Ran Viyana' damaged during the LTTE bomb attack on the Maligawa was repaired in 2001 during the time of Ranil Wickremesinghe's premiership.
He said the Sri Lanka government had promised a donation of one million US dollars to the Government of Nepal towards archeological excavations carried out in Lumbini and Kapilwastu, the two important Buddhist citadels.
After paying homage to the Sacred Tooth Relics and receiving blessings, the Prime Minister met the people who crowded round the Sri Dalada Maligawa and interacted with them. He promised to usher in a massive development programme in the Kandy city shortly.
When some people in the crowed asked the Prime Minister about delay in bringing corrupt figures in the previous regime to book, the Prime Minister said no one would be able to escape from the law because the legal activities regarding 80 incidents of fraud and corruption were now being finalised. He said work on the Colombo-Kandy Expressway would be completed soon.
