Scouts need to adapt to modern advances - President

The policies and objectives of the Scout movement founded by Lord Baden-Powell were made according to the economic, social and cultural features of society at that time and amendments should be made on par with the modern world based on knowledge and technology while protecting the original values of the movement, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
He was speaking at the President’s Scout Award 2014–2018 ceremony held at the Cooperative Institute in Polgolla, on Saturday.
President Sirisena said the success of children’s future could not be decided only by examination results and the Scout movement will provide a great opportunity to overcome the practical challenges we face in our lifetime.
One thousand, one hundred and ninety-five scouts representing 37 districts received awards at this ceremony organised by the Sri Lanka Scout Association.
President Sirisena also launched the new website of the Sri Lanka Scout movement. The President also extended his best wishes to the scouts participating in the Air Scout Jamboree.
The Sri Lanka Scout Association presented a special award to the President in recognition of his great contribution towards the Sri Lanka Scout movement. Recalling the financial sponsorship provided by the President to Kandy Dharmaraja College scouts who went on a mountain expedition in Nepal, a special honorary award was presented to the President. Central Province Governor P.B. Dissanayake, Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake, Sri Lanka Scout Association Chief Commissioner Merrill Gunathilake and others participated in this event.
