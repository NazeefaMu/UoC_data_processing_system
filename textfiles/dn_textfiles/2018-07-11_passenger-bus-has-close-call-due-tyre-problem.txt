Passenger bus has close call due to tyre problem

The front tyre of an SLTB bus plying between Badulla and Mahiyanganaya had a close call when its front tyre had come off along with its axel and some other parts recently. The bus was carrying 80 passengers along with schoolchildren when the accident occurred at the 15th mile post.
According to the passengers, if the bus had been travelling on a slope or near a water body, the accident would have been serious.
