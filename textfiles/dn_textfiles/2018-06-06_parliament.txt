Parliament

Kumarasiri’s name was proposed as post had to be retained from govt ranks:PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said the name of MP Ananda Kumarasiri was proposed because the Deputy Speaker post had to be retained within Government ranks.
He told Parliament yesterday, that the convention when appointing the Speaker, Deputy Speaker and Deputy Chairman of Committees, was that two of them are from Government ranks, while one from the Opposition.
He made this observation in response to Opposition Leader R Sampanthan, who urged the Government to accept the SLFP nomination of Dr Sudarshini Fernandopulle for the Deputy Speaker’s post.
The PM replied that it was the TNA who objected to the initial proposal by the Government to appoint SLFP Jaffna District MP Angajan Ramanathan as the Deputy Speaker.
“When the Government first suggested a member, it is you all who opposed him, not us. When you all objected, we came up with another name. We bowed to your wishes in withdrawing the first candidate. Not that we told the SLFP that we did not want that MP. What we said was that it had to be a back bencher. There was no other SLFP back bench MP remaining in the Government and none of the SLFP Deputy Ministers were willing to resign to take it up. Therefore, we had no option other than to propose someone else from the Government side,” the PM responded to Sampanthan.
The Opposition Leader, taking the floor immediately after the Speaker announced that a secret vote would be taken for the Deputy Speaker post, said, “We have been working on the basis of a consensus with regard to the election of a Speaker, Deputy Speaker and Deputy Chairman of Committees. In terms of that consensual arrangement, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya was appointed from the UNP and Deputy Chairman of Committees S Adeikkalanathan was appointed from the TNA. The SLFP had proposed a name for the Deputy Speaker.
I urge that we accept that name in keeping with the tradition and work on the basis of consensus. It has been a healthy tradition that had prevailed.”
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe noted that the consensus was to appoint the Speaker from the UNP, a member of the Government Group as the Deputy Speaker and an Opposition MP as the Deputy Chairman of Committees.
“This was different from earlier times when all three members were from the Government. As long as, the nominated member is from the Government Group, it did not matter to us.
There had never been a situation where the Government had to take a minority. Always the Government has had two members and the Opposition has had one member. We are keeping with that tradition,” the PM said.
The Opposition Leader before the vote begins once again urged that the matter be reconsidered, despite the initial thinking of the PM and accommodate and accept the SLFP nominee.
‘Commissions obtained from Norochcholai Power Plant more than $20 Million’
Evidence has been unearthed pertaining to the Norochcholai Power Plant suggesting that more than 20 million dollars had been obtained as commissions from foreign companies involved in the construction of the plant, Power and Renewable Energy State Minister Ajith P. Perera yesterday said.
The evidence had surfaced from international investigations carried out on certain irregularities that had taken place when constructing the power plant, he further said. State Minister Perera also said that persons who were involved in such irregularities were enjoying the delay of these investigations. However, enjoying such delays would be possible only for a short period of time, Perera said.
State Minister Perera pointed out that there had been no irregularities recorded in the 11 tenders that had been granted by the present government on the supply of coal to the CEB.
He said that the present government had operated with transparency when granting of tenders, unlike the previous regime.
Answering to a question by UNP MP Nalin Bandara with regard to a company named Nobel Resource Limited, which was involved in supplying coal to the CEB, State Minister Perera also said that US Dollars 366.353 million had been paid to a quantity of MT 4,585,670 supplied by the said company to the CEB without a standard tender procedure.
According to Perera, Nobel Resource Limited has supplied a total quantity of MT 4,585,670 to the Ceylon Electricity Board from 2010 to 2015. He pointed out that the said company had been granted the tender from a special Cabinet approval during all these years, without any proper procurement procedure.
Perera also said that there was an ongoing investigation on the transactions with regard to these coal supplies. CEB trade unions have filed a case at the Bribery Commission on the matter, he pointed out.
Perera said that the operation of the Norochcholai Coal Power Station was interrupted for 24 days, as it had failed to supply coal on time.
The time duration was from September 28, 2011 to October 23, 2011. The loss pertaining to the delay had amounted to Rs. 3,500 million, he said. Another Rs. 12,500 million loss had been recorded due to the same reason during the year 2014 - 2015, State Minister Perera observed. Perera also said that there was no valid agreement with this company pertaining to the coal supply as well.
He also said there are no local representatives separately in respect of tenders numbered LCC/09/T/02, LCC/01 and LCC/13T/01 obtained by the Nobel Resources Limited.
FCID dispatches 101 files to AG’s Department after investigations:Minister
The FCID has sent 101 files to the Attorney General’s Department after the completion of investigations, Public Administration and Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara told Parliament yesterday. He was responding to a question by JVP MP Dr Nalinda Jayatissa. He said the FCID which was established on February 24, 2015, had received a total of 336 complaints. However, the minister refused to provide details on the complaints of which investigations have been completed, stating that he could not divulge information before the AG proceeds on legal action. Questioned as to when those files were referred to the AG, the minister replied that he had to take the AG’s permission prior giving such information.
‘Clear division witnessed in JOs voting pattern’
A clear division in the Joint Opposition could be seen in the voting pattern at the secret vote to elect the Deputy Speaker of Parliament.
Some JO MPs were seen deliberately dodging the vote by remaining at the Parliament canteen for the entire period of the secret vote which lasted for about one hour and 45 minutes.
Nearly 11 JO MPs were conscious of their absence during the vote and some of them even spoke in Parliament during the oral question round which was held prior to the election.
JO MPs who abstained from voting and remained in the canteen when the voting was in progress were Shehan Semasinghe, Kanaka Herath, Mohan P Silva, Ramesh Pathirana, Kanchana Wijesekera, DV Chanaka, Piyal Nishantha, Kumara Welgama, Rohitha Abeygunawardena, Tharaka Balasuriya and Chamal Rajapaksa. Some other JO members were seen casting their votes.
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa too had earlier been in Parliament, but did not turn up for the vote.
JO Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena, speaking in the House just before the vote commenced, asked the support of all to appoint MP Dr Sudarshani Fernandopulle as the Deputy Speaker.
Scope of Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act broadened
The scope of the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act has been broadened to include the tracing of crimes committed via internet, information communications technology, cloud computing, blockchain technology and trading in of any digital currencies.
The Government yesterday in Parliament presented a Bill to amend Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act for First Reading.
The Act provides for combating transnational crimes and strengthening the prevention of crimes. The amendment had included new sections to provide for the facilitation of video conferencing technology and joint investigations for the above purposes.
The Bill has expanded the grounds of refusing assistance by including instances where the criminal investigations or proceedings have commenced in Sri Lanka. It has provided provisions to expedite the process of taking evidence or receiving documents or articles for investigations.
A new part has been added to the Act to provide for the assistance in relation to findings of bribery of foreign public officials or officials of public international organizations.
COPE MPs Aluthgamage, Samaraweera not suitable to be in Committee: Ajith P Perera
COPE MPs Mahindananda Aluthgamage, Jayantha Samaraweera and Susantha Punchinilame submitted affidavits in Parliament yesterday, stating that they had not received any grant from the Perpetual Treasuries Ltd., or its Beneficiary Owner Arjun Aloysius.
MP Aluthgamage called on other COPE members to follow suit and submit affidavits if they had not obtained any money from Aloysius. He urged to avoid appointing tainted MPs back to the COPE. He went on to say that the CID had questioned the personnel attached to the MSD of 24 MPs over cashing certain cheques.
Intervening at this point, UNP MP Ajith P Perera said that he approved the request to avoid appointing tainted MPs back to the COPE, adding that both MPs Mahindananda Aluthgamage and Jayantha Samaraweera had been indicted by court for misappropriation of public funds and property. “They are also not suitable to be in the Committee,” he said.
Prime Minister says it is timely that a female be appointed Speaker
While congratulating the newly elected Deputy Speaker Ananda Kumarasiri, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said that it was time that a female Parliamentarian be appointed as the Speaker of the House. The statement was made in a lighter vein, however with deserved significance.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe pointed out that UNP Senate Member Adline Molamure was selected as the first female Deputy Speaker in 1955.
“We have had a female President, a Prime Minister and a Chief Justice. The position of Speaker of the House however, has been held continuously by males. With the government’s policy to promote females in politics, a large number of female representatives are now at Local Government bodies,” PM Wickremesinghe observed.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe pointed out that despite the vote for the Deputy Speaker being a politically motivated one, the Deputy Speaker will remain impartial.
“The ballot for the post of Deputy Speaker indeed took a political nature. The parliamentarians voted according to their political affiliations. UNP MP Ananda Kumarasiri was elected by a majority. But who we have now is Deputy Speaker Ananda Kumarasiri, who we all expect to be impartial and just,” PM Wickremesinghe pointed out. Premier Wickremesinghe expressed his confidence in Kumarasiri for fulfilling his responsibilities as the Deputy Speaker to its best.
The Prime Minister also commended MP Sudarshani Fernandopulle for her significant contribution and service done to the people as well as in supporting the common candidate in 2015. He also thanked former Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala for successfully fulfilling the duties of Deputy Speaker while he held the position.
Govt. ready to distribute Influenza vaccine at any given time:Dr. Senaratne
The government is ready to distribute the influenza vaccine at any given time; however, we are still awaiting the approval of the National Technical Committee on Influenza to take action, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said yesterday.
Dr. Senaratne pointed out that the present government had already allocated Rs. 8,500 million on vaccines given to cancer patients and on stems for cardiac patients, while allocating funds for influenza vaccine was not a difficult task. Minister Senaratne said that the vaccine was already registered in Sri Lanka, but the distribution of it was not his personal call. There area a number of specialists in the National Technical Committee on Influenza, who will decide on the matter, he said. Minister Senaratne also observed that the World Health Organization has commended Sri Lanka for its advanced immunization programme.
Meanwhile, referring to a matter raised by MP Sudarshini Fernandopulle, Minister Senaratne said that he himself did not agree with appointing a medical administrator to the post of Chief Epidemiologist.
A significant drop in the number of influenza patients had been recorded from May 31 to June 3, 2018, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said. According to Dr. Senaratne, there had been 2,510 influenza patients reported from Galle, Matara and Hambantota as at June 3, 2018. Accordingly, 930 patients from Galle, 864 from Matara and 716 from Hambantota have been reported. Dr. Senaratne stressed that only 15 deaths had been reported caused by the influenza virus.
Minister Senaratne also said that three additional specialists have been assigned to the Karapitiya and Kamburugamuwa hospitals, while 20 nurses were also assigned to the same.
Cabinet approval had been granted to purchase drugs and other requirements necessary to control the viral flue, without tender procedure. He also said that all requirements to expand the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit of the Karapitiya hospital had been taken by the government as well.
