US Independence Day : ‘Sri Lanka, US have solidified cooperation’

President Maithripala Sirisena extended his greetings yesterday to the President of the United States of America Donald J. Trump and the people of US on their Independence Day on July 4.
“The government and the people of Sri Lanka join me in congratulating you, the government, and the people of the United States of America as your great country celebrates 241 years of independence on July 4,” President Sirisena said in a message. His message added: “Relations between our two countries are almost as old as the American Republic itself, dating back to the time that the American Constitution was adopted. Our peoples have been at the forefront in strengthening our bonds. With the establishment of formal diplomatic relations in 1948 and ensuing political and commercial engagements, the longstanding ties between Sri Lanka and the United States continued to flourish and gain greater momentum.
“Today, especially after the election of the national unity government in Sri Lanka that I lead, relations between the United States and Sri Lanka have reached a high point, with solidified cooperation in both bilateral and multilateral spheres. I am confident that under your able leadership, the Sri Lanka - United States Partnership will receive further impetus based on our common commitment to democratic values and mutually beneficial vibrant trade and business relations.
“Please accept, Excellency, my best wishes for your happiness and wellbeing and for the continued progress and prosperity of the people of the United States of America,” the message stated.
