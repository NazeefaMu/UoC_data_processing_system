Third Space Learning to expand operations in Sri Lanka

Third Space Learning, a UK owned BOI approved company which has made significant investments in Sri Lanka, is looking to expand in key cities in the country, said Tom Hooper, Founder and CEO of Third Space Learning speaking to Daily News Business recently.
“As a company we have raised £3.5 million for investment for offices in London and in Sri Lanka. We are creating a number of jobs for Sri Lankans, especially in Colombo and, in near future, in key cities in the country. We have given employment for 220 people at our new regional headquarters at Orion City, Colombo 9,” he said.
“We are planning to open offices in other key cities in Sri Lanka, while Colombo will remains as the core operation centre. Within the next 12 months we are looking at other options; we have not finalized anything as yet,” he said.
“We began operations in August 2015 in Sri Lanka and we strongly believe that Sri Lanka has talented people, great culture, and a stable economy. We had great success during the past two years in Sri Lanka and the location is well positioned to support for our global ambitions,” he said.
“Over the next one to three years we are targeting to double our tutors here in Sri Lanka and building other operational centres in key cities in the country,” he added.
“We are planning to create more than 1,000 jobs for young Sri Lankans to engage in the global digital economy,” said Roshan Nilaweera, CEO of Third Space Global.
“Third Space Learning is projected to grow 200% over the next 24 months as it expands to new markets and geographies. This will result in Third Space Global creating another 250 jobs and opening new offices across Sri Lanka. Third Space Global is an exciting statement of the innovation and development that Sri Lanka is capable of,” he said.
“We moved recently to our new regional headquarters at Orion Cityon a three-year lease and we have invested over Rs. 30 million. We are planning to set up new offices across the island. We are looking to set up two offices in Kandy and the South, between Galle and Matara and we are going to invest more for these expansions,” he said.
“Third Space Global is here in Sri Lanka for the long term and we see that Sri Lanka as playing the regional hub for South East Asia. Currently we have two offices in India and we believe that Sri Lanka would be the hub for the entire region,” he added.
“Third Space Learning is building the world’s first global and scalable teaching network of highly trained online tutors supported by cutting edge technology. Third Space Learning offers the largest network of one-on-one Math tuition in the UK. In the last four years, the company has worked with 16,000 children across 600 schools, delivering 200,000+ teaching hours.”
