SriLankan makes progressive  changes to Winter 2018 schedule

In keeping with its strategy of optimizing and rationalizing market opportunities throughout its route network, SriLankan Airlines will be introducing a range of significant changes to its winter schedule.
Accordingly, the National Carrier will be deploying state-of-the-art A330-300 aircraft on its daily Melbourne operations from October 28, 2018. The Airline is pleased to offer its passengers an unmatchable travel experience, with its elegant cabin ambience completed with mood lighting and entertainment featuring over 100 movies, live news and weather updates. With Wi-Fi connectivity available on-board, passengers also have the luxury of staying connected; making calls or sending mails and browsing.
The Airline is also expanding its capacity on the Colombo-Singapore-Colombo route from October 29, 2018 with the introduction of wide bodied Airbus A330 aircraft that are equipped to provide modern inflight comforts with the latest inflight entertainment systems, luxurious seating and on-board cuisine that is among the finest in the sky. The Airlines’ weekly frequencies will be increased to 21 flights per week from the current schedule of 17 flights per week. Out of this, 7 flights will be operated by A 330-300 aircraft, while the remaining 14 frequencies will be operated by A 320/ A 321 Neo’s. This capacity enhancement is aimed to offer over 2400 additional seats per week, thus enabling the Airline to serve more passengers.
Having re-evaluated its presence in the Far East, the Airline is suspending operations to Hong Kong with effect from October 27, 2018. This decision has been taken following careful assessment of commercial results over a significant period of time.
The airline will continue to evaluate future opportunities in the Hong Kong region, as it does with all its markets.
Arrangements are being made to route passengers who have already purchased tickets to and from Hong Kong, on other airlines. SriLankan apologizes for any inconvenience caused due to changes in flight timings.
SriLankan operates a route network of 114 cities in 48 countries from its hub in Colombo, with a fleet of modern aircraft with the latest comforts such as flatbeds in Business Class and sophisticated in-flight entertainment, to complement its world class service. As a member of the prestigious oneworld global airline alliance, SriLankan also connects its passengers to over 1,000 cities in 160 countries around the globe through its oneworld partner airlines.
