Non-display of pandals on Vesak only a request: Minister

The Buddha Sasana Ministry has not banned the display of Vesak pandals altogether but has only requested not to display them on Vesak Full Moon Poya Day, said Buddha Sasana and Sustainable Development and Wildlife Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera, yesterday.
He said Vesak pandals can be displayed from the day following Vesak Poya Day. He added that these are only requests and not orders. The requests are applicable to Poson Full Moon Poya Day and Poson pandals as well, he said.
Minister Perera added that he made the request based on the wishes of the Venerable Maha Sangha in order to direct more Buddhist devotees towards Prathipatti Pooja (practices) in temples.
The Minister made these observations during a ceremony to launch the commemorative issue of the First Day Cover and three stamps to mark the 2,562 Vesak Full Moon Poya Day, at the Buddha Sasana Ministry auditorium in Colombo.
He said he included the proposals made by the Venerable Maha Sangha in a report he tabled in Parliament during his Budget speech for 2018, in which the Ven Sangha’s proposal not to display pandals on Vesak and Poson Full Moon Poya Days is envisaged.
He added that there had been instances when the display of Vesak pandals was banned through circulars. He pointed out that it had happened in 2002 when W. J. M. Lokubandara was the Buddha Sasana Minister.
“Sri Lanka is the only country that postponed May Day due to Vesak Full Moon Poya Day, which falls a day before May Day,” Minister Perera. He said based on the request of the Mahanayake Theras, the government decided to postpone May Day and rallies.”
“We are planning to formulate a three-year national policy for the development of Buddhist culture and temples in the country. This would be presented for Cabinet approval. We have categorized the temples in the country as A, B, C and D of which the latter two are those that have minimal facilities,” Minister Perera said. “We have planned to provide basic facilities to these temples within three years. A Cabinet paper in this regard will be presented soon.”
He said an insurance policy would also be introduced to Buddhist monks for their education and to cover health expenses. He added that the Ministry would take measures to conduct meditation programmes in government institutions at district level.
Buddha Sasana Ministry Secretary Chandrapema Gamage also spoke on the occasion and Buddhist Affairs Commissioner General Nimal Kotawelagedara was present.
