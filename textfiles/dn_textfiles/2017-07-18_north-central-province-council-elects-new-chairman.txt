North Central Province Council elects new Chairman

 
United National Party (UNP) Councillor D.M. Amaratunge was elected as the North Central Provincial Council (NCPC) Chairman a short while ago.
Former NCPC Chairman T.M.R. Siripala was forced to step down from the post following a no confidence motion presented by 11 UNP provincial council members at the NCP Council meeting held today.
