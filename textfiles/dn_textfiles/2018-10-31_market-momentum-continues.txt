The Sri Lanka Stock market has seen a positive upward trend from last Friday, said MP Anura Priyadharshana Yapa.
He said that this started after removing Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe last Friday.
Colombo Stock Exchange’s main index the All Share Price Index has gained 115 points or 2 percent, closing in the 6, 000 mark following the changes that took place in the country’s political landscape last Friday. On Monday too the stock market ended on a positive note, with the ASPI gaining 20.14 within the day to close at 5964.32 points, while the S&P SL 20 gained 24.61 points within the day to close at 3,083.20 at the end of trading. This is the third consecutive market day where both indices have made gains, since last Friday (26). The points gain recorded in the ASPI (29th) of 112.22 points, was the highest daily points improvement in the index since February 2015.
