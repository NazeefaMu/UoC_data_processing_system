Swift trademarks cats’ names for new projects

Taylor Swift has moved to trademark the names of her beloved pet cats for a variety of potential new ventures, including musical recordings and a live show.
The Shake It Off hitmaker often features her furry friends Olivia Benson and Dr. Meredith Grey on her social media pages, and has even started to use their images on various merchandise sold on her website.
However, Taylor has now applied to register "Meredith and Olivia Swift" at the U.S. Patent and Trademark office, with the documents seeking to reserve the rights to the phrase for use on clothing, handbags, and jewellery, among other items.
According to TMZ.com, the paperwork also indicates the possibility of using the names on musical recordings and a Meredith and Olivia Swift series.
The news emerges months after Taylor's famous felines scored cameos in the ‘Deadpool 2’ movie, where their images were used on a T-shirt worn by celebrity pal Ryan Reynolds as his anti-hero character Deadpool, alongside the words, "Olivia & Meredith Best Friends Purrrrr-Ever". Music News
