The pitches play a vital role

As the saying goes ‘Sri Lankans are like rabbits being chased by wolves’. At present, against the Proteas the curse is said to be fast bouncy wickets, with a good measure of swing thrown into the melting pot.
When a young team is struggling to find its feet in no-man’s-land even the dormant of critics might spring out of the woodwork to make hay while the sun shines. This is the normal form and one should not get agitated by this scenario.
Delving into the past, it is interesting to note what Partab Ramchand in his book “The Gentle Executioners” had to say. He was referring to Anil Kumble, the present coach of the all conquering Indian team who are blazing a victory trail in India at present.
Apparently Kumble has had a poor tour in South Africa, and Ramchand states as follows, “The allegations returned to haunt him on the tour of Sri Lanka where the pitches were heavily loaded in favour of the batsman exemplified by the events at the Premadasa Stadium during the first Test at Colombo that saw 1489 runs being scored and only 14 wickets being taken. The average of 106.35 runs per wicket was the second highest in the 120 year old history of Test Cricket and Sri Lanka ran up the highest total ever 952 for 6. Things were slightly better for the bowlers in the second Test adds Ramchand , this was also played at Colombo but at the nearby SSC grounds when 1403 runs were scored and 32 wickets taken. The home team batsmen teased, tormented and toyed with the Indian bowlers who in absolute adverse conditions found the going tough. All the bowlers were dealt with harshly but somehow it was Kumble, who bore the brunt of the criticism probably because of his stature and because of the stories that were already circulating that he was ineffective abroad.
Ramchand goes on to add that it was okay for bowlers like Nilesh Kulkarni and Rajesh Chauhan to finish with the kind of figures that they would see in their bad dreams but given his reputation Kumble was expected to take wickets in any clime and in any condition. No bowler took more than his haul of five wickets in the two Tests but the fact that these were obtained at 86 runs a piece attracted adverse comments. For the record Kulkarni and Chauhan who played in only the run riot at the Premadasa Stadium had figures of one for 195 and one for 276 respectively.
Ramchand states that, Kumble’s critics also overlooked the fact that Sri Lanka by then was formidable opposition not only at home but also abroad. Their status as the World Cup champions had given them the confidence of tackling the best even at Test Level and Ramchand mentions that in batsmen like Sanath Jayasuriya, Roshan Mahanama, Mahela Jayawardene, Aravinda de Silva, Arjuna Ranatunga, Marvan Atapattu and Hashan Tillekaratne they had world class players.
If any proof was needed of their rising stature in the longer version of the game they provided it on the return tour of India later in the season.
This goes to show that Sri Lankan Cricket peaked in 1996; the above mentioned names mentioned by him were world class to a man indeed. Leave alone seven world class players, at present we have none and Mathews and Chandimal are still no match to the above mentioned stalwarts.
The gaping holes left by Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene are getting wider and deeper by the day. It certainly is disheartening to note that in the 3rd ODI played on Saturday, the two young batsmen Kusal Mendis and Dhananjaya de Silva who are earmarked for greater things in the future failed miserably. Mendis after showing glimpses of his brilliant talent went reaching out to drive a ball he could have left alone or played off the back foot and gave a catch to the covers.
This was poor shot selection and unnecessary haste. Dhananjaya on the other hand came and played a lethargic forward defensive shot to Imran Thahir, as if he was in a hurry to get back to the comfort zone of the dressing room. No wonder, the boy must have witnessed the thumping on the helmet that brave skipper Upul Tharanga absorbed. De Silva the talented batsman looked jaded I feel that at this level the enthusiasm should be sustained.
With the material at hand one cannot point fingers at the people up above. My guess is that let the pot simmer until it gets to boil one fine day in the future.
