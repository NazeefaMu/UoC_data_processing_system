SLCP condemns any form of violence against human beings

The Council of the Sri Lanka College of Paediatricians (SLCP) at the Council meeting recently, brought in an Emergency Resolution, to condemn all forms of violence against human beings of any religion, race or political affiliation, which would lead to physical or emotional trauma to children and adolescents.
“We believe that such events would ultimately lead the way to revenge and retaliation which would result in long-lasting effects on the minds and psyche of children and youth of our motherland. The outcome of such a scenario would continued with youth violence. We need to understand that the laudable principles propagated by all religions are that vengeance leads to more vengeance and only compassion and dialogue could heal differences.”
“The College of Paediatricians would earnestly request the public to refrain from acts of violence and retaliation against other human beings, while our institution would wish condemn any such activities by extremists and will collaborate with the government in strengthening ethnic harmony,” Professor Asiri Abeyagunawardena, President of the Sri Lanka College of Paediatricians stated in a statement.
