Johnston seeks bail from SC

Former Minister and Kurunegala District MP Johnston Fernando, has filed a Special Leave to Appeal application in the Supreme Court seeking an Interim Order directing the Kurunegala High Court to release him on bail until the final determination of this application.
A revision application filed by former Minister Johnston Fernando seeking an interim order to release on bail was yesterday refused by the Court of Appeal.
Johnston Fernando remanded in connection with the misappropriation of Rs. 5.2 million in public funds, filed this application challenging the Kurunegala High Court order to remand him until the conclusion of the trial. He is also challenging the Court of Appeal judgement dated September 17, 2018, to dismiss the petitioner’s revision application.
On September 17, 2018, the Court of Appeal delivered a judgment dismissing Johnston Fernando’s revision application.
On September 3, the Kurunegala High Court issued an order to remand former Minister Johnston Fernando, former Lak Sathosa Chairman K.M. Fernando and the former Minister’s Private Secretary Raj Mohideen Mohamod Sakeer, until the conclusion of the trial.
The Attorney General alleged that Johnston Fernando as then Minister in charge of the Cooperative Wholesale Establishment (CWE) had allegedly ordered that goods worth over Rs. 5.2 million be released from three CWE warehouses in Yanthampalawa, Wehera and Mallawapitiya in the Kurunegala District during the North Western Provincial Council Election in September 2013.
This petition was filed through counsel Sanath Wijewardane.
