Sumithrayo: Your friend in need

Sumithrayo’s primary aim is to prevent suicide, which is being promoted by providing emotional support through befriending. Open daily from 9.00 am to 8.00 pm including holidays and Poya days where it enables distressed persons to reach them.
The service is free, provided by trained volunteers. Anyone could walk in or telephone to share their concerns in a language of their choice in total confidentiality. Mel Medura is the outreach arm of the Sumithrayo, assisting those with substance dependence to overcome addiction. It is funded through the donations of well-wishers and also by funds raised during their annual Avurudhu sale. This year’s sale is being held at the Shalika Hall, Park Road, Colombo 5, on March 24, from 9.00 am to 4.00 pm.
