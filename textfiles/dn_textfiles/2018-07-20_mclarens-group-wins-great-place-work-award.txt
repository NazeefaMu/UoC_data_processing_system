McLarens Group wins Great Place to Work Award

The McLarens Group, was recognized as one of the “Top 25 Great Places to Work” in Sri Lanka, for the third consecutive year, at an awards ceremony held at Hilton Colombo on July 11.
The Great Place to Work Institute primarily focuses on developing high trust workplace cultures by helping companies recognize, mold, improve and sustain their unique workplace environments. Many A-list corporates apply for this award and this year the survey was conducted based on a study of over 30,000 employees from an excess of 115 companies representing over 20 industry sectors.
Since the award is about assessing a company’s workplace culture, the survey is purely based on whether the employee thinks the company is a great place to work or not. This involves obtaining and evaluating confidential and anonymous feedback from employees about behavior; respect and fairness at the workplace through the Trust Index Employee survey while information about the company’s value system, programs and practices is gaged through The Culture Audit Management Questionnaire.
“A company is only as strong as the people who make up its foundation. The McLarens Group has been in the industry for over 70 years and it’s the passion, the enthusiasm and the consistency of our employees that has been one of our key driving forces. Our family oriented culture further strengthens the relationships amongst employees across the Group and promotes togetherness,” commented Shehara Jayawardana, Joint Managing Director of McLarens Group.
The name ‘McLarens’ has been synonymous with service excellence over the last 70 years and remains committed to maintaining and continuously enhancing the quality of services provided.
