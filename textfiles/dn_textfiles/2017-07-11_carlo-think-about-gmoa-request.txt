Carlo to think about GMOA request

GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge yesterday said that Prof.Carlo Fonseka told Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) officials that he would think about the request made by the Association and come to a decision in connection with continuing to serve in his current position.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, Dr. Aluthge said that the GMOA met SLMC President Prof. Carlo Fonseka at his home yesterday and handed over a letter requesting him to continue his service in his current position which is legally not vacant yet.
Prof. Fonseka is still holding his position under the provisions of the Sri Lanka Medical Council Ordinance which permits to appoint the SLMC President for a period of five years. The Health Minister has no authority to remove a SLMC President from his position before his completion of the full term under the Sri Lanka Medical Council Ordinance.
