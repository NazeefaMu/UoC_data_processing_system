Education Minister to appoint committee to improve school cricket

Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam addressing officials of the Sri Lanka’s Schools’ Cricket Association said that one of the reasons of the Sri Lanka National team’s disastrous performance was due to the inability of the authorities to pick talented school cricketers in the junior teams.
The officials of the Schools’ Cricket Association have failed to identify outstanding cricketers from rural areas and absorb them into the national junior pool which has resulted in school cricketers being unable to reach international standards when they are picked for the national team. He said that the Education Ministry hope to form a committee comprising former cricketers and coachers to get their advice to unearth rural cricketing talent and nurture them.
So that they would go on to represent the national team. He said a special meeting has been scheduled for September 12, Tuesday at 3.00 pm at the Education Ministry which will be attended by well known former Sri Lanka cricketers and coachers to get their views on how to improve school cricket in the country.
