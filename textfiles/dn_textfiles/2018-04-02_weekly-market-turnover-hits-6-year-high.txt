Point of view
Equity markets received a boost this week as LOLC Holdings (Pvt) Ltd.’s purchase of a 29.97% stake in its own subsidiary, Lanka Orix Leasing Company (LOLC Plc) pushed markets away from its 8-week low and to its highest weekly turnover in 6-years.
Weekly market turnover hit a 6 year high of Rs.19.4Bn (+432% W-o-W) as LOLC Holdings purchased a 29.97% stake in LOLC Plc from ORIX Corporation of Japan for a value of Rs.12.8Bn.
The transaction, which helped push turnover levels to 6-year highs, is the highest since Mar’2012 when Khazanah Nasional bought an 8.85% stake in JKH for 14.5Bn, and surpasses both Singaporean company Group Lease Holding’s Rs.10.9Bn acquisition of 29.99% stake in Commercial Credit & Finance Plc in December 2016, and Hayley’s Rs.10.5Bn acquisition of Singer Sri Lanka in Sep’2017.
Although the transaction led to a net foreign outflow of Rs.9.9Bn and dragged the YTD net outflow on the CSE to Rs.2.5Bn (cf. YTD net inflow Rs.7.4Bn on 23rd March), the activity in the market helped the ASPI post a slight recovery after 4 consecutive weeks of W-o-W declines.
The broad-share price Index consequently gained ~33 points (+0.51% W-o-W) despite hitting an eight week low of 6440.2 on Wednesday.
The Index’s ~37 point gain on Thursday (following the LOLC transaction) helped the ASPI end on positive note (on a W-o-W basis) for first time since the rise of communal tensions in early-March.
Markets in the week ahead are likely to look for cues from the results of the upcoming no-faith motion against PM due mid next week and the CBSL’s 2nd monetary policy meeting for the year.
LKR records highest appreciation for 2018 YTD
The CBSL this week called for proposals to raise upto $1Bn, adding that the Foreign Currency Term Financing Facility (FTFF) could be denominated in USD, Yen or Euro or any combination of these currencies.
The FTFF is aimed at helping finance the country’s bunched up external debt repayments beyond 2019 which are estimated at $3.6Bn per annum between 2019/20224.
The CBSL added that rates on the 3 year maturity FTFF could be fixed or floating at a USD, JPY or Euro 6 Month LIBOR.
The LKR meanwhile appreciated against the USD for the 1st time in 3-weeks as exporter dollar sales and inward remittances outweighed seasonal importer demand for the US currency.
Worker remittances are typically higher during the traditional new year period while this year’s seasonal importer demand has reduced somewhat providing greater support for the LKR.
The LKR consequently strengthened 0.3% W-o-W against the USD following 3-consecutive weeks of weekly depreciation in the range of 0.1-0.3%.
The LKR appreciation this week was the highest appreciation again the USD so far this year, as the previous instances of LKR appreciation ranged between 0.07% W-o-W (in late-Jan) and 0.1% W-o-W (in early march).
The LKR has lost ~1.5% of its value against the USD so far this year in line with the LKR depreciation in the comparable period last year (1.4% in Jan-Mar’17) but notably higher than the depreciation of 0.4% in Jan-Mar’16.
With the approach of the traditional New Year in mid-April, currency dealers expect the LKR to remain under pressure on the back of continued importer demand for dollars.
