Chorusing for a cause

For the past few months, there was music in the air for Sujatha Vidyalaya, Nugegoda. The Sujatha Vidyalaya choristers spoke the language of music, underscoring its ability to unite all universal realms. They not only had a rich experience at their debut participation at an international choral event, but also managed to bag both silver and bronze prizes at the Kuala Lumpur International Choir Competition (KLICC) 2018.
The event has been taking place in Kuala Lampur, Malaysia, for three consecutive years. The previous events were titled MICF 2016 and KLICC 2017. Choir groups from Malaysia, Indonesia, China and the Philippines took part in the event. The Sujatha College choirs represented Sri Lanka.
A friendship concert had started off the event on May 11. Then the senior choir competed in the youth category while the junior choir took part under the children’s category. There was also an open category at the event.
The choir which competed for the youth category had 21 members. The girls were divided into soprano and alto. Four altos comprised the choir while the rest sang in soprano. Around 22 choirs from different countries competed with them. The choir sang the songs “When You Believe” and Celine Dion’s “I’m Alive” at the event. They had decided on those two because the songs and their beats were quite different from each other.
“We got to know about the event through a parent who works at a travel agency. She sent us the information and encouraged us to take part. We too realized that this is a chance for the students to show their colours on international stage. So there was a lot of enthusiasm to take part,” teacher in charge of Western Music at Sujatha Vidyalaya and Highlands College Tharanga Abeygunawardena said.
Speaking to the Daily News choir leader Uleena Udabage said that that the experience has been memorable as well as exciting.
“We sang a Sinhala song - Bathiya and Santhush’s ‘Sri Lanka Matha’ for the friendship concert and that gave us a lot of confidence to face the actual competition. It was like a warm up round,” she said adding that she has been a member of the choir from grade six.
“We have done well at all island singing competitions too and had won many accolades. It was a different atmosphere at the international event. We were both nervous as well as excited to take part. However our experience in taking part in national competitions helped us adjust ourselves for the competitive nature of the event,” she expressed.
Tharuki Ranasinghe says that they managed to learn a lot from KLICC.
“We were able to watch the performances by other choirs and learn from them. Malaysia won the gold and Indonesia bagged the silver in the youth category. We were overjoyed that we managed to clinch the bronze. The Malaysian choir performed exceptionally and I was enthralled by their performance,” she enthused.
Nimasha Panditharatna is in grade seven. She says that the practice sessions went on till around 7 am early mornings. They had also practiced during holidays because there had been very little time for preparations.
“Besides singing I am into badminton. I have loved singing from childhood and have been in the junior choir from primary onwards. Some might think that being a part of a choir demands a lot of time. True, you have to be dedicated to it but there is time for studies and other extracurricular activities too if you plan properly,” she opined.
Chirani de Silva notes that she would encourage other students to join a choir because it enriches ones life experiences.
“They too can take part in international choir competitions and win like us. I was a part of the primary choir too,” she said with a smile.
Enuri Jayasinghe says that the most challenging moment in the competition was when they sang “I’m Alive”.
“That was a tough one but we managed to pull it off in the end and impress the judges,” she said.
Dulyaa Dissanaike Bandara advices choristers of other schools to work hard so that they can win anything.
“Cooperation, team spirit and hard work helped us win the event. Our colleagues were overjoyed by our win and wished us well,” she added.
The Sujatha Primary Choir comprises of 33 members who took part in KLICC 2018. They sang “Somewhere Only We Know” and “Try Everything” for the event. Six choirs from Malaysia competed in the Children’s Category along with the Sujatha Vidyalaya Junior Choir. Sujatha Vidyalaya Junior choir bagged the silver prize at the event. Nadeeka Bakmiwewa and Supushpi Jayasundara were the teachers in charge of the junior choir who went for KLICC 2018.
“Most of us were new to the choir so we had to practice a lot. We were selected out of an audition. The teachers fine tuned our singing and we got to show our talents at the ‘Sparkling Sujathians’ annual concerts, “Junior Choir leader Senulima Dhananji Thirinamma said.
The Sujatha Vidyalaya choristers said that they would like to thank their principal Pushpa Kalubovila and all those who helped them in their path to success.
