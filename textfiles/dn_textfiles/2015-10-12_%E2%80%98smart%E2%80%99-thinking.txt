‘Smart’ thinking!

She is Sri Lanka’s pioneering woman film director of national and international repute. At 80 years Sumitra Peries says that if she were 21 today she would pursue exactly what she had chosen in life at present: a life dedicated to cinema.
“Making movies is no walk in the park. However that is my passion and I would have taken the same career path even in the modern world,” said the ‘poetess of Sinhala cinema’.
She was the first Sri Lankan director to shoot with one of the most advanced cameras in the modern world: the Red Epic. She shot her latest movie ‘Vaishnavee’ with the camera and laid the foundation for the next generation digital cinema in Sri Lanka. This shows her willingness to put the latest technology to good use.
Sumitra says that she would not shy away from the latest technological devices even if she was more than half a century young.
“The smartphone is the most revolutionary addition to the modern world. I would certainly possess one if I were 21, but would use it with the utmost responsibility. It should be used to share thoughts and connect with people not for destructive purposes,” she said. She notes that she had engaged in many memorable adventures when she had been around that age in past.
“I sailed on a yacht in France. It was something quite exotic then. I would repeat the process even today,” she said. Sumitra notes that she has always broken away from the stereotype. She says that even today she would be different from the modern youth.
“I wish to break away from the image of the average, Buddhist, middle class girl. I would have chosen Visakha College, Colombo, as my Alma Mater again because I believe it is rooted in our culture. The home I use to live in is still there. My school too has remained unchanged,” Sumitra says.
She believes that she would be more of an environmentalist. Since pollution is destroying Mother Nature, she would do whatever she can to save the planet. “There are a lot of things I wouldn’t do today,” she adds with a smile naming tuition classes, Hindi films and public display of private emotions as taboo for her.
“I am against exhibiting one’s personal feelings in public places. Therefore I would go to the park only to catch a breath of fresh air. Holding hands is fine but some youth go over the limit. Now Bollywood speaks in a language that I do not want to understand even at the age of 21 years today. The media has opened doors to a lot of areas for young people to communicate private feelings. This is harmful.
They need to cope with their emotions,” she said. A positive thing she sees in becoming much younger is that she would get the opportunity to meet good friends who are not available by her side today. If she was many years younger, she would be able to visit them more easily.
“One fact that I am sure is that I would not be the stereotype person. I would be different from the other youth. Yesterday, today or tomorrow I would be a special person who contributes to the betterment of the society. I would try to cope with the world around me and take more care in handling matters. I am thoroughly against violence. I wish to celebrate life by engaging in acts which beckons the humane side of people,” she concluded.
