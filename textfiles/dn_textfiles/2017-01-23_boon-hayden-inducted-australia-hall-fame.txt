Boon, Hayden inducted into Australia Hall of Fame

Sydney: Test greats David Boon, Matthew Hayden and the late Betty Wilson will be inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame this week, Cricket Australia said on Sunday. Top-order batsmen Boon and Hayden were key figures who played more than 100 Tests for Australia, while all-rounder Wilson was a female cricketer "ahead of her time", Hall of Fame chairman Peter King said.
"David Boon and Matthew Hayden are among a select group of just 12 players to have appeared in 100 Test matches but their significance goes way beyond that simple statistic," he said. AFP
