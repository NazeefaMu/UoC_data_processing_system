NELSON MENDIS –THE COMPLETE COACH

 
Nelson Mendis is the director of coaching at the CCC School of Cricket at Maitland Crescent since 1998.
His coaching career started at Dharmasoka College Ambalangoda in 1960 - later he moved to Nalanda in 1965, as the Junior Coach, when Gunapala Wickremaratne was the Principal. During this time apart from coaching junior cricketers, Mendis also had to train the cadets as the Officer in Charge of the contingent. He was the Junior Coach cum Master in Charge of the cricket teams of the college. He was also the Teacher in Charge of Discipline and was a Warden of the Hostel.
He served Nalanda College in two spells as he had to join the Teachers Training College in 1969 and later during the insurrection in 1971 he was mobilized in the Sri Lankan Army where he served for nearly five years as an English and Current Affairs instructor to the Army Officer Cadets at the Sri Lanka Military Academy Diyatalawa.
In his first spell from 1965 to 1969 he was able to coach guide, and produce Sri Lankan cricketers of the caliber of Bandula Warnapura, Anura de Silva, Lalith Kaluperuma, Sanath Kaluperuma, Sunil Jayasinghe, Jayantha Seneviratne, Anura Ranasinghe and Keerthi Ranasinghe.
Mendis rejoined Nalanda in 1975 and served till 1979. During this spell, the veteran coach recalls, that he was able to produce more national players like Roshan Mahanama, Asanka Gurusinha, Kumar Dharmasena, Gamini Wickremasinghe, Chamara Dunusinghe, late Roshan Gunaratne, Yohan Gunasekera, Hemantha Devapriya and Susantha Karunaratne.
Nelson Mendis had the unique distinction of bagging 5 wickets in 5 balls which is a record in Mercantile Cricket history. He took 3 wickets in the last three balls of one over and followed it up with 2 wickets in the first two balls of the next over. He represented Singer Sports Club and his opponents were Stafford Motors. In his era he represented Bloomfield, Badulla, Army and Old Sokians.
The “Guru” was full of praise for Anura de Silva, the complete cricketer. Nelson narrates an interesting story about the Nalanda team visiting St. Anthony’s Katugastota on their annual 1st eleven encounter in the late sixties. Anura de Silva was the captain and when the train transporting the Nalanda cricketers reached the Kandy station, he was mobbed by all the ‘Market johnnies” of the Kandy market who were staunch supporters of the State religion. They were telling “Anura putha, Anthony’s eke evunta bada sudda wenna denna.” From the station the team went to the College, where they were billed to stay. Once they were there some members of the team and a few others got permission from Nelson Mendis to go to a host’s get-together in Kandy town.
Afterwards they arrived at the college hall well past the curfew time of 8.00 pm. The following morning Anura de Silva was feeling a bit “under the weather.” By noon they were to start the match and Anura being the skipper was ready to go to toss. Nelson Mendis the strict disciplinarian recalls once again, that he prevented Anura from going to toss because he was feeling ill at the time, as a result Palitha Seneviratne went to toss and won, Nalanda elected to bat, late Wasantha Seneviratne (another prodigious talent who never fulfilled his intent due to circumstances beyond his control, he also was not related to Jayantha or Palitha) got out, and in walked Anura de Silva to a tremendous roar from the crowd , he settled into his element from the word go and hammered the Anthonian attack into smithereens . The end product was a glorious 137 runs. For reasons best known to them, the crowd who were not affiliated to St Anthony’s went delirious and they strode out of the ground with pride. The occasion was rare for them as well as special. Not only did Anura shone with the bat, he performed well with the ball as well scalping five wickets. This stupendous performance enabled Nalanda to beat St Anthony’s for the very first time. The veteran coach recalls that the wayward genius stamped his class in no uncertain terms.
Anura broke into the SSC enclave through sheer talent, but he was cold shouldered by the men who mattered at the time, in spite of that he scored a century in his first outing. The next match in their fixture was on a Saturday and the SSC dance was on the previous Friday. The most prominent figure in that era at the SSC was a grand old gentleman, who called his shots at will. He banned all the team players from going to the dance. Anura had the audacity to defy the ban and went and stayed till 12.30 a.m. the following day. He sauntered into the dressing room on Saturday morning to find out that he was made the 12th man, Anura was dumb-struck and he slung his kit bag over his shoulder and walked out disgusted and that ended a career of the most gifted Nalanda cricketer thus far. It was a pity that Sri Lanka lost another great who would have been as good as Aravinda de Silva, according to Nelson Mendis.
The latest feather in the cap of Nelson Mendis is the tour of England with the Sri Lankan under 19 cricket team recently, where they created history being the first under 19 team to win both the Test and ODI series against England. Nelson Mendis was the chef-de-mission of the tour party with Mahinda Halangoda as manager and Roy Dias as coach.
Nelson Mendis still coaches his charges at CCC School of Cricket six days of the week.
