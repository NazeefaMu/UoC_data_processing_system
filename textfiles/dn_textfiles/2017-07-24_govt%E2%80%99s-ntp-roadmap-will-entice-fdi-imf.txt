Govt’s NTP, Roadmap will entice FDI -IMF

The National Trade Policy (NTP) formulated by the Government recently and the Roadmap on Investment Climate Reforms that identify strategies to create an enabling environment will attract Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) to Sri Lanka in future, said IMF mission Chief of Sri Lanka, Jaewoo Lee during a video conference from IMF Headquarters in Washington.
The media briefing in Colombo was conducted by IMF members Jeff Danforth and Cory Hillier.
Sri Lanka and Maldives ILO Resident Representative Eteri Kvintradze co-ordinated the briefing.
The main objective of conducting the video conference was to highlight the second review of the Sri Lanka’ s economic programme, related to the three –year Extended Fund Facility (EFF), granted by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to Sri Lanka .
IMF Mission Chief Lee was also assisted by IMF senior economist Sarwat Jahan , IMF Economist Suchanan Tambunlertchai and IMF Senior Communications Keiko Utsunomiya,
During the presentation from Washington Lee also explained several key points of the second review of Sri Lanka’s economic programme.
Responding to a question Lee said it was true that Sri Lanka’s world ranking on the Ease of Doing Business is not the strongest, but they knew that the government was working on improving it.
“Furthermore, the IRA will simplify the country’s tax system, making it more efficient and transparent which should be favorable to foreign investors, he said. Lee also said the IMF is hoping to publish the staff report soon which will provide Sri Lanka with IMF views and analysis more in depth, as well as more detailed data.
“ You can also see the authorities views on issues related to economic policies,”.
At the conclusion Lee said the IMF is hoping to have a 2-way dialogue with Sri Lanka to hear your interests and concerns.
It is also said that the ILO mission had discussions with several key Government representatives including in this regard. The IMF mission also discussed with Sri Lankan business community, civil society and International partners.
According to Lee, the mission made a significant progress to reach a staff level agreement with the Sri Lankan Government on completion of the first review.
It is said the mission and the authorities discussed plans for a transition to flexible targeting as the monetary policy framework, possibly supported by IMF technical assistance.
The Mission also encouraged the Government to make concerted efforts in implementing structural reforms in public financial management and state owned enterprises that were building on technical assistance received over the years.
