To join the brimming river

The brilliance and radiance of the Victorian period of English poetry are partly owed to one of the greatest poetic icons, Alfred Lord Tennyson. I might have come to this understanding due to the very reasons how my teachers at the school and the university level would have imparted their knowledge to me in such a penetrating manner or my further reading about the poet for my literary pursuits.
A profound study into the depth and width of his poetry paves one to widen his spectrum of aesthetic faculty while the affective and cognitive domains also would effortlessly propel him to land in a quite new world of reawakening. The ultimate bliss for him would rest in his eagerness to empower the fellow human beings to follow suit.
The teachers of the yesteryear were the genuine pathfinders of the modern world. Such is the noble duty of the teacher.
Let me revisit ‘The Brook’ by my muse Alfred Lord Tennyson hopingly to take you to a brand new world of poetic experience to the amateur and a poetic retreat to the literati. The brook he saw in England then is the same throughout the world in the profound sense except a little fretting here and there. To a more advanced learner, it would be more interesting and inspirational to remember the eagle in ‘The Eagle by the same poet.
Authentic details
In the poetic narration, it is implied that the poet might have walked the whole length of the beautiful flowing of the brook. It is evident in the authentic details given in the poem. Would you kindly imagine that you are at the very place where the water is gushing out to start the brook?
The Eagles may be in flight in the blue deep. We are enveloped in the lush green. The cooling effect would wrap you as we are in a virgin jungle away from human habitat. Tiny drops of chilly water are at your feet, better to remove your shoes to feel it. While the Eagles are clasping the rock face of the high mountains and some others are in a picturesque circling in the deep blue, see how the coots and herns are very near you in their haunts.
Please do not disturb them, it is their natural habitat. The place is slippery, take utmost care and keep your balance. See how the little brook is making a sudden attack and splash sparkling among the ferns. What a wonderful wealth for a poet! The Brook is going to bicker all the way down the valley.
I come from haunts of coot and hern
I make a sudden sally
And sparkle out among the fern
To bicker down the valley.
The coot and the hern are two kinds of small birds that live close to the water courses in shady places. They make our walk down the valley quite interesting and harmony among natural elements is beyond our imagination.
See around! You could count around thirty hills in a very natural array. Let’s go down on the untrodden paths. The brook is slowly getting speed so let’s quicken our steps. You can see the mossy stones with the violets very nigh, yet half-hidden from the eye. See the lovely slipping of the brook between the narrow and raised parts on her way. Down there are the villages twenty in number.
Our journey is not tedious; we are on the flat land.
See the town at the distance, a little one. On the way, with the brook, we have to pass fifty bridges. Don’t you feel tired? Let’s have a rest on the bank of the brook in the shade of the lush green.
By thirty hills I hurry down,
Or slip between the ridges,
By twenty thorps, a little town,
And half a hundred bridges.
From pure nature, we are entering the dreadful mouth of peril, environmental pollution. Pure water in our beloved brook would get putrid also.
Philip’s farm is ahead. She flows down by the farm. Some comely damsels are reaping the harvest. Please do not disturb. Stop here or gently pass. The lovely flow is heading towards the brimful river. It is her desire and of us all, the tiny spring, then the stream is pregnant with water. The writer is also pregnant with aesthetic feelings. The brook flows looking for the river to end in the sea.
Tennyson adds a bit of his philosophy into the brook but not to flow with water to an unknown destination, yet to open the eyes of the people to the truth of life that will come to light at the end of the poem when the brook joins the brimful river.
‘For men may come and men may go,
But I may go on for ever.’
Varying sounds
The brook flows down on a rocky surface. It is in personification. She chatters all the way in varying sounds, musically in a high pitch sound. She takes a lovely circular shape. The beauty of this brook ‘s dance is at the helm when she bubbles on pebbles. Her gait on the small round stones with the auditory effects tantalises us. Tennyson’s diction is superb, ‘Bubble on the pebbles’ The alliteration produced by ‘bb’ creates mesmerising poetry to the aesthetically aroused reader.
How the brook is fretting the banks takes us to our common scenes in the tranquil idyllic life by a river. Tennyson rhythmically takes us to his aesthetic world. Tennyson describes the catchment area with many a field and fallows with Willow –weed and mallow. Again the array of the consonant ‘w’ creates a lovely scene. The repetition of the chattering sound with the desire of joining the brimming river reminding how men may come and men may go, yet she is on a continuous journey without stopping to reach her aim, gives us the message.
The book tells us the sounds that she makes, she chatters and clatters – can you hear her sounds. Let’s go along parallel to her, yet the bank is slippery and so, take utmost care, don’t embrace her, now she is proud as her belly is large. She has a strong desire – to join the brimming river. She always reminds us that her journey is unstoppable, yet ‘men may come and men may go’.
The lovely journey is now very picturesque ‘a blossoming sailing’ not only that strong and lively trout fish `are in brook waters and by her, you can see grayling , a kind of duck. The bucolic neighbourhood is eye catching. The flow of water makes foam. Now she flows over golden gravel. Taking all these things she is hurrying towards her aim, the brimming river. She reminds us,’ men may come and men may go’
The vicinity of the water snake-like Brook now is greenish with lawns and grass. She flows romantically. She sees the forget –me-nots of the happy lovers. You can just imagine the idyllic environment that pleases our senses, it is purely palpable, the loveliest of all is as follows,
I slip, I slide, I gloom, I glance.
The short action words are frequently used by Tennyson in his oeuvre. It is a peculiar way of the poet. How she gets into a dancing mood is in the company of the sunbeams is kinesthetic and the water is shallow above the sands. The scene is picturesque and very inviting, pleasing the eyes, a watery treat to our tedious journey down the brook. It is a soothing balm to our weary mind.
Poetic excellence
The letter ‘l’ in the above line performs an enormous duty as alliteration. Again ‘sl’ followed by ‘gl’ create a magnificent line in poetic excellence. The effect of the visual imagery arouses our emotions, gives ideas and we form attitudes about her, the brook. She is a very active promising damsel now.
Among my skimming swallows:
I make the netted sunbeam dance
Against my sandy swallows.
Her lovely gait gains new beauty with moonlight in the starry heaven. Sometime, she may join her brimming river tonight itself. Murmuring sound under the moon and starlight is perfectly matching. With the flowing brook, we are also making for the brimming river in another sense.
Thick vegetation along the bank is mainly bramble. The fragrant enchanting environment is palpable even in the moonlit night. She is very proud. She takes everything around her as hers. Cresses belongings to the cabbage family. She says, ‘my cresses’ she is loitering, not flowing. In fact loitering around her cresses. In this penultimate line, Tennyson prepares the springboard to enter the bringing river.
She negotiates her last , yet the comely bend she is taking prior to joining the brimming river.
And out again I curve and flow
To join the brimming river.
By this time, I do believe, you may be feeling awfully tired on this long journey with me. Here’s good news. You might not have expected to end the journey because of the cooling effect of pure nature with her watery treat and the virgin soil at your feet and the sylvan glades, I showed you. The immortal pleasure for being able to take you down all the way unhurt on a slippery path, keeps me kicking.
‘ For men may come and men may go,
But I go on forever.
The tapestry of English literature is gem –studded. In a way, the bards who brought this wealth to us are redoubtable.
