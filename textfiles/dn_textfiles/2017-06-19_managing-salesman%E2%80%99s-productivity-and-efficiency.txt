Managing the salesman’s productivity and efficiency

The modern way of viewing sales is not the volume and value, but the sales efficiency. Customers will be looking for the value creation by the sales person.
Managing the salesman as a productive, efficient sales generator is the responsibility of thesales manager. The sales manager needs to manage the sales enablers effectively. Sales versus sales enablers (also referred to as the key performance indicators) are extremely critical for successful performance and to monitor control, manage and stimulate the salesforce.
In any business model whose primary value offering is providing products and/or services to customers, there is one universal truth: no matter how great your project or service is, your business will certainly fail if you have an inefficient sales process.
Motivation as a tool for improving productivity
Improving the efficiency of your sales team starts with motivation. It will be illustrated in detail as a function of sales management, but in a nutshell, the best way of motivating the salesforce is creating a competitive culture with compensation and rewards systems in place.
Most organisations use sales automation systems which integrate the daily performance of each person and it is upto date and transparent reporting.
It also lets everyone in the company feel more connected with the sales teams and to our sales process since we are able to display sales figures, sales trends and competition in real time on a large central display in our office.
Sales efficiency is the way of managing time (time management) in a competitive business environment where time is money, meaning managing time efficiency results in cost efficiency. Moreover, we will discuss how the salesman becomes a cost saving instrument and contributes towards the profitability of the organisation.
Sales efficiency refers to the speed at which each task is performed in the sales process. To increase sales, companies need to investigate their sales process to detect the weaknesses that can be treated with sales effectiveness software or by reorganising and strengthening existing processes.
For example, sellers spend too much time on administrative tasks. Efficiency is measured by input versus output concept. The input is the salesman point of view; likewise output is the volume.
On the contrary, what is the sales manager's role in this context? Take a stick and be a principal behind the salesman or lead the salesman from the front towards efficiency?
Instead of adding sales resources, many companies can begin to see if they are utilising the resources that they already have. For startup companies that have resources at their disposal or more established companies wanting to try a more customizable and flexible approach to deal with changing market conditions,the efficiency of sales growth has become more important.
Sales productivity measure
Sales productivity is a measurement of the amount of money that you make from the efforts of each salesperson. Conversely, effort refers to the selling time per salesperson and also the average sales per day.
Likewise, the sales value per person can be measured continuously but the sales manager needs to monitor based on a set benchmark.
Firstly, what is sales productivity and why should you worry? The revenue productivity and the cost, effort and time, usingminimsl resources - this means to maximise the sales results.
In the 20/60/20 rule usually, about 20% of the sales, is done by top performers who meet or exceed the sales targets. Therefore, a large part of the sales team leaves room for improvement and opportunities to improve productivity.
In many cases, the productivity of optimised sales, you only need to eliminate the rationalisation and unnecessary work and rework of workflow.
The sales manager needs to make sure that there is accurate benchmarking by analysing the external factors, sales trends, and competitor activities which impact theorganisation's strategies. Sales forecasting is different from monthly sales benchmarking and productivity measure, which we will be discussing in the future. For example, if Salesman A is at 90 % in comparison to salesman B who is at 85% achievement in sales volumes, is Salesman A more productive than Salesman B?Is this conclusion correct? It is necessary to argue on the efficiency for the correct conclusion.
Sales productivity means greater sales volume, lower payroll expenses and more efficient time management. Measuring the salesforce size for a particular business strategy is a technique. Under territory management methods, the factors to consider the salesforce size decisions will be discussed.
But the inefficiency of the incorrect decision on “salesforce size” will lead into many financial and business losses. Most of the time the assumptions and calculations can be accurate but the mistakes done by the sales manager is that the efficiency and the effectiveness of the individual deployed for the territoryare not measured.
In performance delivery, quicker conversions of prospects into sales closures, upselling, cross-selling and repeat purchase ratio will vary from person to person. When there are slower performers, the annual effectiveness of the territory will be low. This is one crucial area where the profitability of the organisation is affected.
Higher payroll expenses will not give equal return to the organisation. As discussed earlier, Pareto spoke about this situation with 80/20 principle where the responsibility of the sales manager is to manage this efficiency at the ground level.
Training as a tool for improving productivity
Also, the way to improve the productivity of your salespeople is to train them properly, reinforce the training and observe them carefully in the field.
Training is not a magic stick to improving the sales productivity but sharing the knowledge and knowhow of the sales team will enable the sales efforts by the sales team and the techniques of sales efforts will generate effective sales.
Great training is useless without reinforcement and the sales manager must train salespersons to practice, rehearse and then make sure they are actually doing it in the real world. It takes time and effort but that is what the sales manager gets paid for.
Effective time management is all about prioritising the efforts versus the time and effort deployed. It is an important sales management function to manage the sales people or productive mechanism which produces the quality output. Later, in sales training and coaching, we will be discussing the techniques to improve productivity through training and measurement for performance.
Personality traits of the sales team
It is vital understanding, knowing and working with the personality style of each team member. This has to be a conscious effort by the sales manager and the strengths and weaknesses of weak salesperson should be clearly understoodby the sales manager and the areas for improvements as well.
One of the key characteristics of a great team is being able to leverage their strengths. Salespeople may be task-oriented or people-oriented or reserved introvert versus outgoing extrovert; sales individuals need to be understood and managed and led them accordingly.
Also, each personality has natural strengths and great teams or leaders know who is good at what and how to leverage the strengths to maximise the productivity and efficiency.
Some of the strengths that can be identified within the salesmen are:
l Planning the sales function and strategizing the approach
l Being innovative and having the ability to solve customer problems
l Persuasion of customers by presenting and handling objections
l Extraordinary relationship building and maintenance
The sales manager should use the team and individuals accordingly and expect the output of weak areas of an individual will lead to inefficiency; also infective management will leadto demotivation and as a result, the salesman will leave the manager, but not the organisation most of the time.
Those that have the strength of sales planning and structuring the approach would be specialists to put in place the best sales process for selling and delivering the right solutions.
Some of the sales approaches, such as problemsolving and sales consultation are strengths that the sales team should develop.
Those salesmen that have the strength of problem solving and innovation can craft the best solution for the customer. The salesmen that have the strength of presenting and persuasion can leverage their ability to be over the competition by delivering and convincing the customer of value offering better than the competition. And those that have great relationship skills and the ability to build trust, can win the customer and create the lifetime value of the customer (LTV).
Each personality style makes decisions differently, communicates according to their style, and is motivated when their strengths are leveraged by their peers and superiors. When a team knows each individual member’s personality, they know how to effectively communicate and work to maximise team performance.
Sales labour productivity
The basic measure of salesforce productivity with the labour productivity equation: total output versus total input. For example, if a company generated Rs. 100,000 worth of goods or services (output) utilising 1,000 labour hours (input).
To calculate the company's labour productivity, you would divide 100,000 by 1,000, which equals 100. This can be measured salesman-wise and drive the labour productivity of each salesperson.
Also, it could be measured as for the sales team month on month and drive the labour productivity month on month. But this will depend on the industry, type of products and services, business environment and the market conditions.
Cost efficiency
Measuring the cost incurred at acquisition of customers is another measure of sales productivity and if the sales manager sees from this measurement that he spent an excessive amount of money in gaining certain kinds of customers, it means that it is a losing deal. The recommendation in this situation is to focus on a different market.
The sales manager may determine the cost by adding up how much he spent in acquiring a customer. If he finds that he spent Rs. 1,000 to acquire sales worth just Rs. 2,000, he might determine that such a sale will not be profitable in the long run, even for a startup business.
Efficiency in revenue to cost
Another way of measuring the sales productivity of your team is to measure all costs incurred as a percentage of the total revenue generated by the same sales team during the same period.
In this context, add up all costs, including salaries, benefits, commissions, and perks. To understand the total cost and calculate the revenue brought in by the salesforce,divide the revenue by the sales costs which will be equal to the ratio of revenue to cost.
If two organisations or two sales teams maintain 30% versus 50% efficiency in revenue to cost, the team maintains that 30% has a higher efficiency compared to the 50% team.
This ratio gives a pretty good idea of the team's sales productivity. After analysing the big picture, the sales manager can calculate each salesperson’s revenue and expenses to find out which salesperson is the most profitable.
Not only are these measures helpful in guiding your future plans and strategies, but they also give you concrete numbers on which to set the benchmark. When you have measurable goals to give to your sales teams and individual salespersons, you are much more likely to improve your success.
Concrete, measurable goals give your team something to work towards and you can celebrate their success as they improve their performance.
Increasing salesman’s productivity and efficiency
Driving revenue and improving customer engagement are the two most common challenges faced by businesses using salesforces today.
To overcome these challenges, companies must focus firstly on the employee engagement. Sales management need to focus on providing sales teams with the solutions they need which will be as effective as possible.
So the question is why is this still a problem after so much investment in ‘sales effectiveness’? One of the main reasons is poor engagement. Poor engagement with salespeople and in turn poor engagement with the customers.
The lack of employee engagement impacts client engagement, creating a poor experience for clients which impacts revenue.
The recommended solution is that salespeople need to do their ‘day job’ and sell, therefore they are unlikely to commit significant time to explain their challenges on an individual basis.
The sales manager firstly and foremost needs to understand the real needs of the salespeople without disrupting their day-to-day activities so that management can truly understand the current situation.
Engaging and collaborating directly with sales teams is the quickest way to get to the core of their issues. By developing solutions based on reality, not management’s perception of their reality, we can truly develop processes and solutions that provide a significant benefit to sales representativess in align with management’s business outcomes.
