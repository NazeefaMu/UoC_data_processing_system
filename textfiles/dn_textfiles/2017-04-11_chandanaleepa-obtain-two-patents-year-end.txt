Chandanaleepa to obtain two patents by year end

One of the largest local cosmetic manufactures, Chandanaleepa will be plans to obtain two international patents for two new products by the end of the year.
Philip Nehri Mullegama, CEO of the company, told Daily News Business that research in this regard which has been done jointly by the Chandanalepa R&D team and two companies in the USA and France have now been completed and were on final test runs.
Some traditional ayurvedha recipes used by the chairman’s (Ranjith Prematillike) father, Dr. D. P. P. Jayaratne too would be used for this innovation. He said that two products would be made using 100% local ayurvedha material and would be marketed both locally and internationally. He said that the factory based in Veyangoda has invested around Rs. 450 million last year for R&D and also for machinery to increase production.
“We are currently exporting to 10 countries including Japan, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Malaysia, Singapore and Dubai. We hope to increase our overseas market to 40 countries by 2020.”
He also said that they will also introduce a child care range and soap by the end of the year. Commenting on the industry he said that there are many cosmetic products that are dumped from China and due to this the gray market is huge. The government must look at curtailing these imports to protect the large local cosmetic industry.” (SS)
