Divi Neguma protest obstructs traffic in Matara

A demonstration launched by Divi Neguma officers, managers and beneficiaries in the Matara town created a two hour traffic jam as they marched from Uyanwatta stadium to the bus stand. The demonstrators demanded an early solution to the problems of Divi Neguma officers and a halt to the pruning down of Samurdhi benefits. Picture by S. Mahinda Weligama group corr
