The nature of survival and success!

The time has indeed come ...many a walrus will grin and all of us islanders, cloaked in anticipation as the Dialog league finally concludes. Survival has been the name of the game Öand the definition of measured performance from the first kick-off back in November 2016. Kandy, Havelocks, Navy and CR likely contenders from their early season form ...but eventually turned out to be lulled into a false sense of security for us fans and team supporters.
Navy certainly looked for that step up and a chance to push the bigger teams out of the way ...and for 80% of the league lived upto expectations, especially beating the defending champions Kandy in the first round and spinning the wheel of fortune their way. But it was desperately short lived and whatever ambition the Navy had.....soon evaporated.
Would have been exquisite prospect for CR, Havies and Kandy ...to fight for the title and write their own history...
The potential to be creative and ability to react under pressure....pretty much the decisive factor, between all teams.
CR on the other hand never really looked the part, or did their businessÖ.with any conviction ....result ....tough reality and just about living up to their potential in the premier division ...interesting to see if they change their combination, for the knock outs.
Driving the badge of courage and flying the traditional club flag, was the old guard and vastly improved Havelocks, whose team performance gave them the best possible opportunity to win the league title. Coach Ronnie Ibrahim defiant about proving his skills, inspiring the team and out thinking Kandy, then grabbing the league cup back to clubhouse in Colombo.
Letís try to nudge some additional performance in the knockouts ...the complex nature of rugby gives them plenty of time to decideÖthe pressure is that the player can be made to react differently.
Knockouts are totally different and anything is possible, given what we have already seen ...Havies can muscle up for a repeat in the knockouts and still feel confident about some silverware ...this month.
Kandy added their own drama by dropping two games in round 1....they spent the 2nd round a lot more focussed and with purpose ...brushing aside all and sundry,
Leading that fight for Havelocks is Dulaj Perera, whose form with ball and anything else, rugby related ...is nothing short of phenomenal ... 171 points from his trusted right boot as he commands respect and nearly had the cup back at the park.
Many will be contemplating how to support the frame.....and outfox Kandy to the next cup title....same team but little fitter, more confident and perhaps their own system of delivering despite the injuries ....with the error of margin so close ...itís really a small fact that will change the nature of this re-clash and a 2nd title to grab some headliners.
Rugby needs another serious contender or two, to match up to Kandy on every level in the middle ...that way we are able to enjoy the highest level of skills, fitness, power, passion and strategy in the middle.
People talk about the brand of rugby played here in Sri ...itís a jealously guarded and heavily protected virtual reality that pops up around this time of our rugby season, and gets the purists all fired up about the order of things etcÖneedless to say, the brand of rugby and our resident experts hallowed opinionÖglorious fiction!
But the stubborn reality, is that we need to set our sights on this most needed brand of island rugby ...then intravenously administer to the coaches and performance staff so our squads are graded on this particular skill set, most important ...the mind for more.
England coach Eddie Jones gave his bench on Saturday Öfor the opening RBS 6 Nations against France - massive compliments for a job well done Öhe said Englandís win was an ugly one and the W was vital.
Most significantly it was the step up from skipper Hartly, the likes of Itoje and Daly who kept the marauding French at bay ...England were lucky to scrape home on the final whistle 19-16 and will take the ugly win with open arms, especially considering 7 injuries to their regulars like Vunipola x 2, Tuilangii, Robshaw, Haskell, Kruis etc. The Lions tour down under putting more pressure on the regulars to have recovered in time to make the cut.
Scotland on the same note sniffed past an in form Ireland 27-22, and shocked the RBS platform 2017 ...it was an equally hard graft 80mins with some lung busting loose work that confronted the mighty Irish boiler house to a grinding halt.
The pundits must be well intimidated and forecast suitable caution with speculation for the rest of the 6 Nations.
Wales have their work cut out and will need some magical performance upgrades to get past England, France and Scotland over the next 2 months RBS 6 Nations schedule.
Breaking news on the schools rugby season being pushed back by another month to accommodate ground availability...cricket big matches...and most significantly of all...a possibility of new partners for title sponsorship of this incredible Sri asset ...and easily the most popular sport in Sri Lanka Ösecond only to international one-day and T20 cricket ...protection for this platform is vital and fortuitous.
We wait with abated breath for the schools association announcement and acceptance of their new partnership with Singer PLC or Dialog Axiata PLC...a massive step for the school game and an assured future for our Asian and Commonwealth Games platforms.
Biggest hand to Kandy for clawing their way back and showing that quality in your squad and on your bench is a massive performance asset ...and gives the coach such flexibility and confidence that can break the opposition.
Kandy tore the 2nd half up with Danushka Ranjan power and skills that separates him from all three quarters in Sri rugby ...he is a sensation and plenty petrol too.
Finally add super substitute Sooriyabandara for 6 mins to full time and his scintillating pace from some dull ruck ball inside his own 22metres ...to pure space down the right touchline past all defenders and just Kutty Dixon’s desperate cover tackle ...to stop the try failed. Full time icing on the cake and a mesmerized stadium that held their breath till Sooriya B flew over the line - his talent and skills the next level of exceptional and vastly underutilized up at their Nittawela championís cauldron.
Blessings rugby hearts ...prepare to absorb the intense knockouts starting shortly...bula bula a new champion club in the making!
