Deepika Padukone-Ranveer Singh avoid each other

Is all well with Bollywood's golden couple, Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone? If recent events are any indication, they seem to be going through testing times.
We told you how the two have been having several fights.
Now, we hear, they have been keeping a distance from each other at the gym that they train at. In fact, Ranveer had become a member of the gym on Deepika's insistence and the couple often worked out together. Things are slightly different today.
"Deepika mingles with the other girls, especially her fellow actresses who work out at the same gym. But whenever Ranveer comes along with her, he keeps to himself in a corner and works out intensely. He doesn't talk to anyone except the trainer assigned to him," says an eyewitness who also works out at the same gym.
Uh oh. That's not the Ranveer we know. After all, the actor is as gregarious as they come and has never shied away from displaying his affections for his darlin' Dippy.
Of course, he showed his caring side at the recent song launch of Bajirao Mastani, where he hugged Deepika to protect her from the thronging crowd.
But sources close to the couple say that the PDA is meant only for the cameras.
Buzz is the two are maintaining a happy facade solely for their forthcoming release, Bajirao Mastani.
You guys may remember that romance had blossomed between them on the sets of Sanjay Leela Bhansali's 2013 release Ram-Leela. And now, their love story has taken a different turn before their next release together.
Let's hope it's nothing but a minor hiccup. We're keeping our fingers crossed.
