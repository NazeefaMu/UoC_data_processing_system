AmCham holds luncheon meeting featuring two Silicon Valley personalities

The American Chamber of Commerce in Sri Lanka held a luncheon meeting last week with two speakers hailing from Silicon Valley, on emerging technologies and their impact on local businesses.
The event was titled, 'Evolution of Silicon Valley tech companies and how it impacts you'.
Mani Kulasooriya, founder of Sysco LABS (formerly CAKE) and Ron May, Vice President - e-Solutions, Sysco Corporation were the two speakers at the event. Both speakers have ample industry experience in the Valley and will be sharing their insights during this session.
Mani led Sysco LABS from a startup in Silicon Valley to eventually be acquired by Sysco Corporation, a top Fortune 100 company. Having worked for companies like Citigroup e-Citi, and Yahoo prior to this venture, he has deep connections in the Valley. An astute tech investor, he has investments in over 25 tech companies.
May is a professional services leader with proven expertise in digital customer experience, direct sales, contract negotiation, P&L management, large scale operations, strategic solution delivery and cultivation of executive level client relationships.
The event was held on December 12 at the Hilton Colombo. It covered some of the foundational technologies that will drive the next wave for disruption and how Silicon Valley companies are leveraging this technology for their own gain.
Silicon Valley technology companies are quickly evolving from being your enabler to becoming your competitor, and are no longer satisfied being the tech leaders of the world - instead, their aspirations now are inclined towards disrupting every industry globally.
The session looked at how one can mitigate this new competitive risk - through leadership, organizational structure, talent and brand with Ron May discussing the example of how Sysco Corporation is going through their own transition.
The main sponsor of the event was Brandix, while it was co-sponsored by Microsoft.
