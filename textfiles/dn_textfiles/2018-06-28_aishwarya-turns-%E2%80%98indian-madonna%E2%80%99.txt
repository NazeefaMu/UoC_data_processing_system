Aishwarya  turns ‘Indian Madonna’

Aishwarya Rai Bachchan will kick off the biggest song of her career this week. Sung by Sunidhi Chauhan for debutant director Atul Manjrekar’s musical-drama ‘Fanney Khan’, it features the actress as an “Indian Madonna”.
The song is being choreographed by award-winning dancer and creative director, Frank Gatson Jr (inset), who has worked with Beyoncé and Rihanna in the past.
“Aishwarya plays a huge pop icon who’s extremely popular with the youngsters. Her character is a fabulous dancer and singer who performs on the global stage. While fleshing out her character, we began referencing a bunch of choreographers who do international live shows. Frank is among the best in the world and we decided to approach him,” Atul tells Mirror, adding that the song is an elaborate portrayal of Ash’s city tours, covering three-four acts and will be shot over eight-10 days in Mumbai.
“Frank was excited at the opportunity to work with Aishwarya whom he knows of and immediately came on board,” says Atul.
Produced by Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra, Anil Kapoor and Bhushan Kumar, ‘Fanney Khan’ also features Anil Kapoor, Rajkummar Rao and Divya Dutta. The August 3 release is loosely based on the Oscar-nominated Dutch film ‘Everybody’s Famous’! Mumbai Mirror
