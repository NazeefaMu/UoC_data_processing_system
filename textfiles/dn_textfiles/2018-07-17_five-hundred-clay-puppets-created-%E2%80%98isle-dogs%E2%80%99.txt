Five hundred clay  puppets created for  ‘Isle of Dogs’

This monsoon is going to be a nostalgic extravaganza for all dog lovers out there with filmmaker Wes Anderson’s upcoming stop-motion animation venture ‘Isle Of Dogs’.
The English stop animation film is set in a fictional Japanese town of Megasaki, which is hit by a canine flu forcing the Mayor to shift the canine population to a barren island. Thereafter begins the story of a young boy in search of his dog. Humans play integral characters in the story.
However, it’s the dogs who rule the film.
‘Isle of Dogs’, with a star-studded cast, 1,000 puppets and 240 micro sets is a wonder to behold. Anderson, who has written, directed and produced the film, wanted to keep the look of all the dogs authentic.
Hence, he filmed all kind of pups in order to analyse their behaviour. The director then began sculpting clay dog puppets based on his observations and analysis. With more than 70 artists on the puppet team, a total of 1000 clay puppets were created out of which 500 puppets were humans and 500 were dogs.
