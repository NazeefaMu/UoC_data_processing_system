Thambapanni Leisure to build Rs 600 mn Yoga Spa Retreat in Galle

Thambapanni Leisure Management in Unavatuna will build Sri Lanka’s first purposely built yoga retreat spa in Pilana, Galle.
Thambapanni Leisure Managing Director, Prashan Dissanayake said their hotel, Thambapanni Retreat introduced Yoga to the area a few years ago and today it is very popular. “We have large groups patronising this service and we decided to expand,” he said.
The company will invest around Rs. 600 million for this project and will build 25 villas in the initial stage.
He said that they have already purchased a 10 acre land for this project and hope to start construction by the end of this year. “We hope to open the hotel in August 2018.”
Dissanayake said that today European travellers are on the lookout for purpose built Yoga hotels and India, Bali and Thailand attract a huge size from this global market which is growing fast.
“We will start marketing the hotel from next year and hope to maintain high occupancy.”
The hotel chain started in 1989 with a restaurant and a three room hotel and today they have three hotels, Thaprobana and Thambapanni Retreat and Thaproban Retreat Pavilion, also in Unawatuna.
Asked why they invested in Unavatuna he said it was because they had business in the area and their brand name was strong.
Monty Ariyaratne Group Genaral Manager said that they will employ foreign staff and also train locals. “The project will generate over 125 direct employment.”
Thambapanni leisure will invest another Rs. 350 million in a 50 room luxury hotel in Kalpitiya “We have already bought the land and hope to start construction next year and this is the first time we are moving away from the South”
