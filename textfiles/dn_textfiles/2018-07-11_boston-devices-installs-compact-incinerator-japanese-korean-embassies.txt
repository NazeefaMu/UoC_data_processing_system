Boston Devices installs compact incinerator at Japanese, Korean Embassies

A compact garbage incinerator, one of the latest methods to waste management, was installed at the Japanese and Korean Embassy premises recently.
This incinerator disposes the waste collected daily from the Embassies in an environmentally friendly manner. A number of people, including the Embassy staff, were present at the occasion.
“The incinerator was introduced to Sri Lanka by Boston Devices (Pvt) Ltd, which is one of the fastest growing Environmental and HVAC service providers in the country. Similar devices are being used in many state and private hospitals, factories, tourist hotels and other establishments in Sri Lanka”, Manjula Navaratne, Managing Director of Boston Devices (Pvt) Ltd said.
The incinerator, which uses Japanese technology, burns waste at temperatures above 1000 degrees Celsius. This enables complete combustion and minimizes the emission of hazardous gases. The amount of ash, left by the process, is also minimal.
The incinerator does not release noxious gases like dioxins and purines. An additional benefit of using these machines is that it produces steam and hot water. The incinerator requires minimal amounts of fuel and uses the gasification process to completely combust waste. The machine can be operated using a small amount of kerosene and there is no need to treat or sort waste prior to disposal.
The system which can be efficiently operated after a brief training can complete a combustion cycle within an hour.
