Chocolate price hike if Brexit deal fails, warns Mars

Chocolate prices could rise if the UK does not secure a trade deal post-Brexit, according to Mars’ top boss.
Fiona Dawson, global president for Mars, said the absence of a deal with EU member states would see tariffs of up to 30% for the industry.
Speaking at the American Chamber of Commerce to the EU, she warned this would “threaten [the] supply chain and the jobs that come with it.” BBC
