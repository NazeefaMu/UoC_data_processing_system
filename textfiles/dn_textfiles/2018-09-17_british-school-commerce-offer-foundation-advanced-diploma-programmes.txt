Furthermore the Foundation as well as the Advanced Diploma, both are offered by the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA), which is validated in over many countries across the globe”.
John Phillips went on to say that the advantage in following the Advanced Diploma in Business was that students who complete the Advanced Diploma course, then have the opportunity to complete their top-up degree in Sri Lanka for a lesser cost.
