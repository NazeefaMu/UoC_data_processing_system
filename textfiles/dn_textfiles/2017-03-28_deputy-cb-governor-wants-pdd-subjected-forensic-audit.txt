Deputy CB governor wants PDD subjected to forensic audit

The Deputy Governor of the Central Bank P. Samarasiri called for a forensic audit yesterday to examine massive irregularities that have taken place in the Public Debt Department when issuing Bonds under direct placements.
He said the forensic audit should not be carried out internally but by an external audit firm.
Samarasiri was testifying before the Presidential Commission to inquire into the Treasury Bond Issue. Additional Solicitor General Yasanta Kodagoda led evidence.
Up to 2015, the PDD has done Rs. 5 trillion worth direct placements of which 95 percent are placed with primary dealers.
The procedure followed by the PDD in issuing direct placements have caused serious discrepancies, Samarasiri pointed out.
He also said that over the years, any officer in the PDD were able to decide on an interest rate upon which the direct placements are issued.
There was no reporting to the public with regard to the issuance of direct placements as well, Samarasiri pointed out.
“Then how did the Monetary Board of any other body get to know about the value and the volume of the bids made, identity of the successful bidders, direct placements’ yield rates?” the Presidential Commission questioned. “Nobody knew,” Samarasiri answered. There have been 2,600 direct placements taken place throughout the course of time, which should be examined by a forensic audit, Samarasiri pointed out.
