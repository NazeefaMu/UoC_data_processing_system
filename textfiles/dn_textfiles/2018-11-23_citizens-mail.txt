Citizens' Mail

Country is everyone’s concern
Anti-democratic pandemonium staged by the pseudo-patriots the other day in the parliament compels me to speak my heart out because of the very fact that I am away from my motherland on a sojourn in Australia to have a retreat from the unpleasant hustle and bustle of undemocratic demeanour of the wrongly elected members to the supreme body of legislature.
Mother and the native land are more excellent than swarga, so says a Sanskrit proverb. My woe is that while most of the other countries are heading steadily toward development, our country is day-by-day becoming hell-bound.
It is discernible to any Tom, Dick and Harry that most of the people in our country are ignorant. Universal suffrage has proved unfitting to our country.
The pith of the matter is vividly exhibited in the ludicrous election pledges such as rice from the moon, eight measures of grain, giving bread at a low price and so on. The worst of the things is that every ruling party takes the school going population as a guinea pig to intellectually ruin the backbone of the nation.
The whole country is dragged into a treacherous bog of intellectual malnutrition to have their political ride forever.
The long-term tragedy is that almost all the rulers, ministers and parliamentarians send their sons and daughters to advanced countries for their higher education while ruining the national system of education. In other words, these rulers who appear as true leaders seem to turn no stone unturned to come to power through devious channels.
People in other countries label us as a very primitive nation that is not able to digest democracy. The whole country seems to have a loose motion of democracy due to indigestion.
The country’s welfare is every citizen’s concern at the final count. Therefore only a handful of bogus patriots should not take it as their birthright. That is where the problem lies. The newly elected parliamentarians below O/L, A/L and below ought to be given a thorough footing on religion, literature, history, sociology, political science and other relevant disciplines to politics.
Before becoming the matters worse, in my opinion, it is opportune to remind our leaders America’s first president Abraham Lincoln's definition of democracy “Democracy is by the people, for the people, of the people.” To cap them all, “The ruler thinks of the next election; the statesman thinks of the nation.’’
The ongoing situation seems to be purely because of the very reason that present-day Sri Lanka has become a battlefield of rulers, but not of the statesmanlike patriots.
