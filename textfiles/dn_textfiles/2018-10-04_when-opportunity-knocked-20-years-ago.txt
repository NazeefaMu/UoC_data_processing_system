When opportunity knocked 20 years ago

‘Four things come not back -- the spoken word, the sped arrow, the past life, and the neglected opportunity’
-Arabian Proverb
In October 1998, exactly twenty years ago, trade chambers and Sri Lanka’s top corporate sector leaders in a unique move jointly requested the then government of Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga and the opposition led by Ranil Wickremasinghe to rise above party divisions to formulate an economic policy and a feasible solution to ethnic crisis to boost the country’s economy. The business leaders felt that Sri Lanka had not achieved the preferred level of economic progress even after economy was opened two decades ago.
Armyne Wirasingha, Patrick Amarasinghe, Lalith Kotelawala, Ken Balendra, Nimal Samarakkody and Nigel Austin were signatories to the appeal that spelt out a formula of ten points.
The ten-point formula
Ensuring parity for all citizens irrespective of religion, race, gender, political connections. North-East conflict resolution to be given priority. Peace and security for all citizens. Official language status to English as a link language. An independent Public Service Commission, Police and Judicial Service Commission. Prior to legislation public debates through white papers published on all important vital issues. A sustainable set policies on (a) Trade and Commerce, (b) Agriculture, (c) Industry and (d) Foreign to remain unaffected for 15 years, which if necessary would change only on mutual agreement by both the government and the Opposition. Reformed Labour Laws introduced (with emphasis on:- Flexibility in labour market, rights and obligations of employees and employers, cut in the number of holidays, productivity linked remuneration system) Educational reforms. National economic plans formulated in consultation with the Chambers of Commerce and industry, trade associations, and employers’ organisations.
The areas listed by the corporate leaders are topics of any party’s concern. They would initially meet President and Opposition Leader separately for talks on the current political and socio-economic situation, before bringing both President Kumaratunga and UNP leader Wickremesinghe together.
The UNP in the previous month summoned an all party conference to discuss fresh procedures for conducting free and fair elections which Minister G L Peiris, of the government undermined.
But whether the two leaders would agree to come on a common platform is another matter. Many small political parties have responded positively to the initiative by the top business leaders’ strategy to resolve ethnic and other problems. The entrepreneurs were optimistic at the end of the first session of dialogue and expressed hope they could convince the UNP leader to join. However, CBK’s scathing attack on Opposition who were contemplating on whether to join or not hindered the progress at the very beginning. The business community’s main objective was to make the two big political parties to work together on a common programme.
The opposition was suspicious of the move thinking the business community’s idea was a trap by the government in conspiracy with some vested interests. The UNP in a letter addressed to the business leaders said:
‘…the North-East issue is the main disaster that faces the country today, therefore we agree to President’s request to accept a bi-partisan approach to it. Regretfully, the government has not acted on this matter. The situation in the North-East continues to worsen. A humanitarian crisis in both the areas of the Wanni, needing imperative consideration is the hunger and malnourishment faced by the people. We would appeal you to make this a topic of priority in your negotiations with the government and help avert the loss of lives. Wishing your programme every success’

Blame game and talks fail
Briefed by Lalith Kotelawala on the action plan, and Armyne Weerasinghe explaining them, the then President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga highly praised the corporate Chairmen for taking the initiative. She analysed the then political situation and how it came about. She blamed the UNP for delaying tactics; said her government wanted to finish the war quickly and introduce constitutional reforms for power devolution, but the process was stuck due to opposition’s attitude. “UNP is responsible for delaying the process”, she told the corporate Chairmen, “we need only 16 votes for the required 2/3 majority” she grieved prompting a member of the delegation to warn the President against ‘harassment’ on the UNP and its leader Ranil Wickremesinghe.
“The war is escalating,” she said, “It is important that we find a lasting solution to the matter early, I want the opposition to join hands with governments to make this a success. It is a joint effort I don’t want personal credit.” she said. She then requested the business leaders to keep RW informed of what emerged at the meeting.
Lalith Kotelawala, Soon after the meeting telephoned Ranil Wickremesinghe and briefed him on the latest developments and wanted to meet him for discussions, who summoned them to his residence immediately. Wickremesinghe expressed approval on what had happened but lamented it was too late, that the UNP’s choice to stay out of it has already been taken by the Parliamentary Group and endorsed by Exco. However, the opposition leader gave an assurance that he would be available the next day to further discuss the issue. Commending the private sector’s initiative to take up national economic issues he said, “We have to disregard the past.”
The business leaders maintained mum and did not give up hopes. In the meantime, on the very next day, a scathing attack by CBK on the UNP at a public meeting created irrecoverable harm to ‘peace talks’, and a serious problem for the corporate leaders. They lost even the little space available to them for negotiation with the UNP about an All Party Conference.
Current economic crises and stark reality
One of the reasons that caused the current economic crises could result from the rejection of the Corporate Sector Formula by the two major political parties two decades ago. Today we are facing an unparalleled calamity that began in the Rajapaksa era and accelerated by effects of Trump’s decision to raise the American interest rates further burdened by the effects of the neo-liberal policies of J. R. Jayewardene.
The efforts of Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera to increase the ratio of Direct taxes against indirect, reversing the trend set during JRJ and continued by successive governments, should be praised. The indirect tax today stands at 85% of the total state revenue. JR reduced direct income tax to the minimum. All these resulted in a plunge of state revenue from relative to GDP by 2014, leaving all the FMs thereafter to seek to minimize the budget shortfall through debt. The indirect tax was the worst feature of neo-liberal economic principals; it replaced the burden of tax from the rich to the masses. Failure by all regimes in the past 40 years are responsible for not developing the industrial sector, the Premadasa rule being the exception. The rupee which stood at Rs 8 for a $ US had depreciated over the past 40 years, under administrations of JR, CBK, MR and the present, all following open/liberal economies to Rs 170.
Any major economic crisis or ethnic problems cannot be effectively solved but for the political parties agree on a course of co-operation rather than conflict, it is a stark reality.
