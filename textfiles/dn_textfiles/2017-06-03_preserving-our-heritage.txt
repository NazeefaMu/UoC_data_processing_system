Preserving our heritage

UNESCO’s World Heritage Sites comprise natural and man-made sites that are exceptionally important for the collective heritage of humanity. There are 1052 World Heritage Sites in 165 countries and territories. Among them are 814 cultural and 203 natural sites, with another 35 “mixed” sites.
Sri Lanka has an amazingly high number of World Heritage Sites – eight – for a country of its size. Italy, which has the highest number of World Heritage Sites (47) is five times bigger than Sri Lanka. The World Heritage Sites in Sri Lanka (in no particular order) are: Sri Dalada Maligawa/Kandy, Dambulla Cave Temple, Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Galle Fort, Sigiriya, Sinharaja Forest and Central Highlands. These are all very popular attractions among locals and foreigners alike.
There was speculation over the last few years that the Dambulla Cave Temple could lose its World Heritage Site listing and according to Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, Galle Fort is also facing the same risk. The Golden Temple of Dambulla (Len Viharaya) was inscribed as a World Heritage Site in 1991 and, the old town of Galle and its fortifications were inscribed as a World Heritage Site in 1988. Their inclusion in the World Heritage Sites list has been a boon for tourism and losing that status would be severely damaging to Sri Lanka’s tourism prospects as well.
So far, only two sites have been delisted from the World Heritage List – the Dresden Elbe Valley in Germany and the Arabian Oryx Sanctuary in Oman. Interestingly, both these are natural sites and no man made sites have been delisted. However, UNESCO says that 55 sites (37 cultural and 18 natural) sites worldwide are in danger. For the moment, this does not include the Galle Fort and the Dambulla Cave Temple, but UNESCO will be making an assessment soon.
The Minister said the UNESCO has recently warned that the above two sites would have to be removed from the World Heritage Site list considering their deteriorating condition. The Minister blamed the Department of Archeology for this state of affairs and we agree with him. Obviously, it has not taken adequate measures to conserve them during the recent past. The Minister revealed that the Government has taken urgent measures to improve their conditions and sought the help of international experts.
There is a precedent for the latter. When the Sigiriya frescoes were threatened by vandalism and decay in the late 1960s, the then Government obtained the services of internationally famous Italian artist and art restoration expert Dr. Luciano Maranzi on the advice of Sri Lanka’s foremost authority on archeology Dr. Senarath Paranavithana, who himself was regarded as a national treasure. They were assisted in this effort by Dr. Raja de Silva, a brilliant chemist. We hope that the Government would be able to obtain the services of a team of restoration and architectural experts both local and foreign to get the two iconic sites back in shape.
Minister Kariyawasam also pointed out another factor - the law has not been implemented by the previous government regarding the illegal settlements in heritage sites. Even in the East, the Department has failed to identify the archeological sites and mark their boundaries. We are glad to hear that the Government is now implementing the law and no illegal settlements are allowed in reservation or heritage areas.
In the light of this revelation, the Government must now review the other six heritage sites too for any sign of decay or damage. Obviously, the requirements for maintaining man-made and natural sites are different. Sinharaja and Highlands face the threat of illicit felling of trees and plants including medicinal plants. Any damage to these sites could also adversely affect the country’s biodiversity, because they host a large number of endemic flora and fauna species.
The archeological and environmental ministries must also draw up a list of other cultural and natural sites that deserve inclusion in the World Heritage List (The World Heritage Committee is meeting next month to decide on this year’s winners). Today, there is worldwide concern for Dambulla and Galle Fort thanks to the publicity generated by the UNESCO list. If further sites are approved, more interest will be generated in these sites worldwide. The authorities should also team up with Discovery Channel or National Geographic Channel to feature documentaries on the World Heritage Sites in Sri Lanka.
It is also vital to train our officials on latest conservation and restoration techniques. They can learn new trends by participating in UNESCO training programmes such as the High-Level Training Course on World Heritage to be held in Beijing in September. UNESCO also recommends having separate museums for world heritage sites which will help educate the visitors and certain antiquities could literally have a far longer shelf life under climate controlled conditions. The Government alone cannot preserve our heritage sites for posterity. Visitors should also be aware of the need to protect these sites. For example, leaving trash at these sites should be a strict no-no. It is only through a collective effort that we can preserve these sites for the future.
