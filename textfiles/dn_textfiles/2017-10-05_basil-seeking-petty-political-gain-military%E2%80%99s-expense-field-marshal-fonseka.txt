Basil seeking petty political gain at military’s expense: Field Marshal Fonseka

Field Marshal Minister Sarath Fonseka yesterday said former Minister Basil Rajapaksa had sought petty political gain at the expense of the entire military when he remarked in Jaffna recently that ‘individuals’ within the Security Forces may have committed crimes during and after the war.
Fonseka said that Rajapaksa who was in Jaffna last week to promote his new party, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna, had betrayed the entire military for petty political gain.
Addressing Journalists in Colombo, Fonseka said that during the recent elections, the Tamil people in the North had clearly rejected the Rajapaksa’s and added that now Basil Rajapaksa was stooping to low levels to win them back for his new political party.
Fonseka also charged that those who protested when he made allegations against former Army Commander Gen. Jagath Jayasuriya of crimes, were silent about comments made by Rajapaksa.
The minister said he had only pointed the finger at one individual and said he was always of the view that if anyone has committed crimes they should be punished, irrespective of status.
