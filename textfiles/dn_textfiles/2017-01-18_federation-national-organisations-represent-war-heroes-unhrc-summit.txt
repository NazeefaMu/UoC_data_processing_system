Federation of National Organisations to represent war heroes at UNHRC summit

Members of the Jathika Sanvidana Ekamuthuwa (Federation of National Organisations) will represent Sri Lankan War Heroes at the UN Geneva Human Rights Summit in March, Dr. Sarath Weerasekara said.
He was speaking at a media conference at the National Library and Documentation Services Board yesterday. Weerasekara said the report by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Prince Zeid Al-Hussein on Sri Lanka war crimes is a hoax.
He said if Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera appreciates Hussein’s report, it is highly unlikely the government will defend Sri Lanka’s war heroes at an international hearing. Speaking on the Manouri Muttettugama Report, Weerasekara alleged that it [the government] supports the needs of separatists.
“This committee report was welcomed by the Tamil National Alliance and the Global Tamil Forum, which are the political pawns of the LTTE,” he said.Weerasekara said with a government of their own all traitors working against the country will be brought before court.
“What we had in Sri Lanka was a non-international armed conflict. For such a conflict, it is not International Human Rights but International Humanitarian Rights which is applied. So the UN is not qualified to accuse Sri Lanka of war crimes on that ground,” Weerasekara said.
He said if any parties are involved in war crimes, they should be brought to justice within Sri Lanka and their offences should be presented before the local judiciary.
“We are currently seeking registration to participate in this summit, which hopefully we will get. If we will not be able to register on time, we have another organisation via which we can participate in the summit,” Weerasekara said.
Ven. Bengamuwe Nalaka Thera, attorney-at-law Kalyananda Thiranagamage and Patriotic National Movement Secretary Dr. Wasantha Bandara also spoke at the media briefing.
