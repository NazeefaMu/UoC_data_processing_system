Freedom of Speech Vs Right to Privacy

British Celebrity Chef Gordon Ramsay’s father-in-law Christopher Hutcheson claimed an injunction against newspapers published by News Group Newspapers Ltd. The objective of the injunction was to restrain newspapers publishing details of a second family maintained by him. The High Court has refused to grant the injunction to him.
The Court of Appeal upheld the decision of the High Court. The case officially is known as Hutcheson v News Group Newspapers Ltd. [2011]. In this case, the Court has made a balance between freedom of expression and right to privacy by giving importance to the fact that the claimant used to publicly argue about his private life: hence, the freedom of speech easily outweighs the right to privacy.
Which rights were in conflict?
Freedom of expression and the freedom of the privacy, in this case, referred to Articles 10 and 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights Convention (ECHR). According to Article 10 (1) of the ECHR, every person has the right to freedom of expression. This right includes freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers.
However, this right shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises. In addition, this right is subject to certain restrictions imposed by Article 10 (2) such as formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties which are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.
The right to privacy is mentioned in Article 8 (1) of the ECHR as ‘Right to respect for private and family life’. Accordingly, every person has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence. Public authorities cannot interfere with the exercise of this right except the situations mentioned in Article 8 (2) such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.
How freedom of speech outweighs the privacy?
When there is a conflict between the right to freedom of speech and the right to privacy, a confusion arises, which one would prevail and how to strike a necessary balance between them. In this case, the claimant and his son-in-law used to argue about their personal and business matters in the newspapers. A newspaper published an allegation that the claimant was dismissed from a company because he had been misappropriating corporate monies to fund his second and secret family. The claimant sought a ‘privacy injunction’ against it to restrain publication. The Queen’s Bench Division of the High Court refused to grant it. The Court of Appeal upheld this decision.
The Lord Justice Gross held that right to privacy could be ‘engaged’. This is rational since the information was related to family life. However, the relationship of the second family was considered a ‘bare fact’ by the Court. It further held, the evidence must come from the affected family members to prove the privacy, otherwise, there is no reasonable expectation of privacy. The Court held that the awareness of the first family about the second one has reduced the weight of privacy claim. It seems irrational because the awareness of the first family does not necessarily mean, the information is placed in the public domain.
Furthermore, one of the most important arguments considered by the Court in favour of freedom of speech was the public interest, mainly consisting the fact that Hutcheson and Ramsey were arguing about their problems in newspapers. However, this argument could be rebutted because when someone is talking about his private life in newspapers, it does not necessarily lead to a public interest which contributes to a democratic debate, while in the present case, the issue appears to be purely private.
Moreover, since the claimant has selected which part of his private life to be disclosed, newspapers should not be allowed to use freedom of speech to publish other details. Accordingly, in the cases Rocknroll v News Group Newspapers Ltd [2013], Contostavlos v Mendahum [2012] and AMP v Persons Unknown [2011], Courts held, although certain information was already in the public domain, a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy for the remaining undisclosed information.
Public forum
Nevertheless, when regularly giving details about one’s private life, a public forum is created. Therefore, it is not unreasonable that newspapers desire to learn more about it because such behaviour develops a public curiosity. Hence, repeated publications by the claimant on newspapers have created a public forum which deprives his privacy claim. Therefore, claimant's inability to maintain privacy in the past has already been counted against him by Courts. A similar view was taken in Carina Trimingham v Associated Newspapers Ltd [2012].
Eventually, the Court of Appeal has given importance to the fact that the claimant has given many personal details about his private life. Consequently, if someone reveals his private life he cannot remain completely private in a public forum. Such a situation permits Article 10 to be applied and outweighs the right to privacy. The Court could have possibly improved the justifications, by investigating whether the claimant was a public figure or not, to make a balance between Article 10 and Article 8.
