Big Bad Wolf lures crowds

The Big Bad Wolf Book Sale will be held at the Sri Lanka Exhibition and Convention Centre (SLECC) until July 8 for 24 hours, non-stop. Entry to the sale is absolutely free.
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said the sale is a good opportunity for Sri Lankan book lovers to get their hands on quality books. “We all have realized the importance of reading and to encourage reading habits among school children Ministry has lined up several programmes. This book sale is a good opportunity for book lovers to get quality English books,” he said.
“The 24-hour book sale concept is to allow all those who are travelling from outskirts of Colombo and those who are working late, to still come and get their reading needs at any time of the day that is most convenient to them. Customers can enjoy 255 hours of non-stop book browsing and get their hands on various types of books,” Malaysian Partner of Big Bad Wolf Books Dipak Madhavan said.
This year, The Big Bad Wolf Sale is supported by the Education Ministry. The partners of the sale are Bank of Ceylon as the official banking partner, Mobitel as the official telco partner, and the sale is powered by The Capital Maharaja Organisation Limited.
Based on last year’s feedback, the sale returns to Sri Lanka bigger and better this year. Book lovers will be able to find a wider variety of fiction books such as romance, thriller, science fiction, literature, and more. There will also be best-sellers and books by popular authors to pick from.
Indulge into a diverse selection of non-fiction books, arts and design, business, biographies, cookbooks, coffee table books and more. Parents can expect an extensive collection of children’s books, including bedtime stories, colouring and activity books, educational books and interactive books, all at bargain prices. All books at The Big Bad Wolf Book Sale are brand new, quality English books.
ProRead Lanka Director, Nishan Wasalathanthri said the aim of a book sale of this scale and nature is to make good books available at an affordable price and to contribute towards the rising readership numbers by increasing awareness on the value of quality English books that can help improve English literacy among Sri Lankans.
This year The Big Bad Wolf will also be donating books to communities in need through their Red Readerhood programme, supporting The Capital Maharaja Organisation Limited’s Gammadda initiative.
