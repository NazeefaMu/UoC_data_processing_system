‘Fake news’ campaign to discredit ministers – Rajitha Senaratne

An organised campaign of manufacturing ‘fake news’ was being carried out to discredit the ministers, Co-Cabinet spokesman Minister Rajitha Senaratne said yesterday.
The minister made this remark at the weekly Cabinet briefing held yesterday at the Government Information Department.
Senaratne was responding to allegations that Co-cabinet spokesman Minister Gayantha Karunathilake was distributing bananas with his picture and name among flood victims. “We have found out who is orchestrating all this. It is a secretary of a son of a famous family who is responsible for creating such fake news. This secretary has been asked to launch campaigns every day to discredit the government," Minister Senaratne said.
He said the ‘Secretary’ had established a centre with computers and around 40 staff members to work on this campaign.
“This time, they happen to choose bananas to do the job," he said.
Meanwhile, Minister Karunathilake denied rumours that he was branding flood relief items and said he had submitted a written complaint to the CID to investigate into the matter.
“In the midst of the floods, there has been certain political activity and an organised attempt to discredit me.
Those who are from my district know that I would never do such a thing, but people outside and abroad have believed such propaganda," he said.
He said this incident was being used not only to attack him but also the government. The minister had given a statement to the CID in this regard on Tuesday.
