Senior cadets arrested for taking nude pictures of juniors

Three senior students of a school in Pilawala attached to the school cadet troop were arrested by the Wattegama Police for allegedly stripping six members of the Cadet Contingent naked and taking video pictures of them on their mobile phones during training.
They attended a Cadet Training Camp at the Rantembe Cadet Training Centre recently. The arrest was made following a complaint made by the school principal on the Police hotline that the students were caught watching the nude pictures in school recently.
Since the filming had been allegedly done at the Rantembe Camp the suspect students have been handed over to the Hasalaka Police as the camp area comes under its area of authority. The suspect students were produced before the Mahiyangana Magistrate and released on Rs 100,000 personal bail each and ordered to appear in Court on July 3.
