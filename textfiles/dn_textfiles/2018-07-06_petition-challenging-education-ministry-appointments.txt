Petition challenging Education Ministry appointments

A Fundamental Rights petition was filed in the Supreme Court seeking an Interim Order staying the Education Minister and other respondents from taking any steps to appoint any persons on a “supernumerary basis” to the Sri Lanka Education Administrative Service in any manner contrary to the schemes prescribed in the Sri Lanka Education Administrative Service Minute 2015.
Sri Lanka Educational Administrative Service Professionals' Association and its Secretary Prabath Withanage filed this petition naming Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, Ministry Secretary Sunil Hettiarachchi and twelve others as respondents. The petitioners further sought an Interim Order staying the operation of any appointment letters or promotion letters issued to any person in violation of the Service Minute. The petitioners stated that they became aware that the the Education Minister had sought approval of the Cabinet of Ministers to appoint an unknown number of persons to various posts of the Sri Lanka Education Administrative Service on a purported “supernumerary” in the pretext of providing relief to persons who have been politically victimised between 1994 and 2015.
This petition was filed through counsel Thishya Weragoda and Niluka Dissanayake.
