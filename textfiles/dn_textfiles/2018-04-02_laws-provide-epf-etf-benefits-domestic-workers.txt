Laws to provide EPF, ETF benefits to domestic workers

Laws to make it mandatory for domestic workers including housemaids to contribute towards the Employees Provident Fund (EPF), will be introduced to Parliament after drafting them, Labour and Trade Union Relations and Sabaragamuwa Development Minister W.D.J. Seneviratne said.
Cabinet approval has already been received for drafting the necessary laws. Once these laws are approved, all domestic servants would be entitled to EPF and ETF benefits as well as accident compensation payments.
The Minister said a minimum salary of Rs. 10,000 is applicable to domestic servants too.
Minister Seneviratne disclosed this at a meeting held to mark the opening of the newly built Polonnaruwa District Labour Office recently.
The three storeyed labour office situated at Kaduruwela built at a cost of Rs. 158 million, has all modern facilities.
It will provide services to nearly 50,000 employees attached to nearly 3,000 institutions in the Polonnaruwa district.
