Saudi grants US $ 45 m for Mahaweli expansion project

The Saudi government granted US $ 45 million to expand the Mahaweli water projects to Kinniya and Kanthalai areas for agriculture cultivation to benefit over 2,000 acres of agricultural lands.
An agreement was signed between Finance Ministry Secretary R. H. S. Samarathunga and Saudi Development Fund Director General and Operations Fowzi Al Saiud in this regard at the Finance Ministry on October 24.
This was a result of Sri Lanka Muslim Congress Trincomalee District Member of Parliament M. S. Thowfeek making a proposal to the Saudi government for the Mahaweli expansion projects.
The Saudi Development Fund also signed an agreement for the Wayamba University building project.
Thowfeek and Secretary of the Saudi Arabia Embassy in Colombo also participated in the signing ceremony.
