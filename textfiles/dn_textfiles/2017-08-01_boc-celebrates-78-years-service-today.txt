BOC celebrates 78 years of service today

With the confidence and trust that has been build over the years in the Sri Lankan Banking and Financial Services sector, Country’s NO.1 Brand steps into its successful 78th year of service as “Banker’s to the Nation” on August 1.
“Having to celebrate 78 years of being the No.1 Bank in the Sri Lankan Banking Industry is an extraordinary tale to tell. Since the Bank’s inception in 1939 to assist the Sri Lankans to come out of the difficult situation that prevailed at that time depriving locals from obtaining financial assistance reasonably, the Bank has been committed to socio-economic development through financial inclusion, providing genuinely value-added services to those who seek reliable and convenient financial solutions and the overall up liftment of the country’s banking and financial landscape to align it with international banking standards.” The Bank of Ceylon’s Chairman, President’s Counsel Ronald C. Perera said.
“I take this opportunity to thank all our beloved customers to whom we owe our success and our main stakeholder the Government of Sri Lanka for the direction, finally to all stakeholders and all Sri Lankans in general,” he further added.
A state council member George E De Silva spearheaded a demand which led to the calling for the establishment of a state aided bank. The inauguration took place at Bristol Street, Colombo Fort on August 1, 1939 with the patronage of the British Governor Sir Andrew Caldecott.
Just as it addressed the need of that time for a commercial bank for people of this country, the Bank still proudly upholds same core values that were transmitted by its founders to be a leader of positive economic change and a passionate banking service provider.
“We know that every step we take to re-modify and transform our banking processes has the effect of providing greater value to Sri Lankans at large. Addressing this concern at all times the Bank continuously maintains and enhances its services to suit the changing lifestyle of Sri Lankans,” stated the General Manager D.M Gunasekera.
In more recent times, innovative steps and out-of-the-box thinking has enabled BOC to grow stronger and strengthen the country’s economic resources.
The Bank has scheduled several events to take place in celebration of its 78th anniversary. Among them are the BOC Ran Kekulu “Little Picasso” Art competition, special Ran Kekulu promotion for babies born in the month of August, several CSR campaigns including a blood donation campaign, a religious procession followed by an overnight “pirith” chanting on 4th August and an almsgiving on the following day.
