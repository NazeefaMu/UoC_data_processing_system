Net- lingo leaves every Bimbo in cyber limbo!

It’s all about that hip new jive lingo all those crazy computer whiz-kids are using! I am gradually getting used to deciphering some of the coined Netlingo by these high-tech oddballs. But I am doing so with the greatest difficulty. I must admit, though that I’m a technological retard in the age of Cyber Civilisation.
For one thing, this computer ‘geek’ jargon is all Greek to me but far worse to many others who are totally illiterate when it comes to comprehending the technical gobbledygook. To the uninitiated, computer parlance may sound a bewildering complexity of the most fanciful terms and phrases.
It may prove mind-boggling at the beginning but comprehension soon dawns on those determined to learn its bizarre terminology. Perhaps I could offer a few tips to the totally ignorant on the slang that certainly has nothing to do with my dear departed aunt Rhonda’s lingo in Bingo. Besides it is often replete with seemingly ever-so suggestive terms which sometimes abound with shades of double entendre.
Let’s begin with the basics. The Internet is not a cafeteria where workers put their hair in. And a Mouse Pad has absolutely nothing to do with where Disney’s Mickey and Minnie live. One incurable moron thought that a keyboard was some sort of rack where he was supposed to hang the keys so the wife could find them. And a keyboard to his Bimbo wife was nothing less than a piano or electronic organ!
Be aware that a laptop is not necessarily a place where grandkids or sexy willing secretaries are allowed to park their butts. An application to pre-computer era minds was a letter for seeking employment. A program was a radio or TV show you tuned into. A cursor, we usually spelled it curser, referred to an obnoxious individual who used profanity. And ‘memory’ was something that you lost with age. A web was a spider's home. And a virus was the flu!
CD was a Cash Deposit you made into a bank account! And if you had a broken disk, with a slight variation in spelling, it was a darn agonising spinal symptom. The inexperienced should be warned not to take words such as unzip in its literal sense. Those naive enough to do so in public would find themselves facing an indecent exposure charge, zipped up and in the lock-up in no time. In computer-speak it simply means to decompress and open up a ZIP file using a file decompression program.
Worst of all was a recent one I came across. It was ‘Hairball,’ which has nothing to do with our succulent ‘rambuttans’ or any other coarse hirsute object you might fancy thinking it is. Hairball, in computer slang means any tangled mess and often refers to a poorly written computer code with Microsoft's name.
A poor geek found himself in a real domestic blitz situation and had to explain to his wife while back-pedalling and parrying a series of blows that the Diskette he was talking of buying was certainly not a female disco dancer. It’s quite bewildering really when you suddenly realise that all of your friends have an @ in their names.
One clueless user called the online helpdesk asking how to solve a problem. The conversation went on with helpdesk advising her: “Double click on My Computer!” The user: “How can I when I can't see your computer?” Helpdesk: “No ma’am, double click on My Computer on your computer.” User: “What? This is all so confusing!” Helpdesk: Look lady, there is an icon on your computer labelled My Computer. Now double click on it.” User: “What the heck is your computer doing on mine?”
I told a young woman writer to call the office technician when her computer crashed. She described the problem and the technician concluded that the computer needed to be brought in and serviced. He told her to unplug the power cord and bring it over to his workstation so that he could fix it. About ten minutes later she showed up at his door with the power cord in her hand. Believe it or not some people can’t figure out the mouse. One story of a woman computer debutante has become part of Geek mythology.
It appeared she had complained that her mouse was hard to control with the ‘dust cover’ on.
The cover turned out to be the plastic bag the mouse was packaged in. More hilarious still was the one related by another technician that one of his customers held the mouse and pointed it at the screen, all the while clicking madly as she would a TV remote control.
The customer got no response and the technician had a hard time explaining to her that the mouse works only if it’s moved over a flat surface.
And talking about mice or rather a mouse is this phrase called word-of-mouse – meaning gossip or information spread via the net, usually through e-mail, blogs or newsgroup postings.
Then again I was persuaded to allow the family seamstress to gain some hands-on experience with my spanking new PC as she had been offered a job as a manageress of a swank women’s clothing shop. I told her to go ahead and left her to it and returned a few minutes later.
The exasperated woman, whose only technical experience had been confined to sewing machines, complained she couldn’t get the computer to turn on.
I asked her what happened when she pushed the power button. “I’ve pushed and pushed on this foot pedal and nothing happens,” she replied. “Foot pedal?” I queried. “Yes,” she said, “this little white foot pedal with the on switch. “The ‘foot pedal,’ it turned out, was the computer’s mouse.
And a cyberpunk looked at me quite pityingly when I inquired whether a ‘fatal error’ made with the e-mail I sent meant that I had killed somebody. But I refused to lose my cool and decided to get even. I asked him quite innocently whether the Adam and Eve virus is one that takes a couple of bytes out of his Apple?
He got a bit suspicious when I explained to him confidently that a Freudian virus is when his computer becomes obsessed with marrying its own motherboard. He left in a huff only to return with the query: “I can’t find my dongle anywhere. I thought I plugged the dongle direct into the back of your PC”.
Revenge is sweet as I spat out at him: “Get out of here you technical pervert and take your darn dangling dongle along with you!”
