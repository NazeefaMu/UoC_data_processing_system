A yummy delight indeed

The Sooriya Village will celebrate the Maldivian Independence Day “Minivan Dhuvas” on July 26 from 6 pm onwards in appreciation and celebration of the thousands of Maldivian people here in Sri Lanka, who study and work amongst us every day.
July Sabbies await a night of pandemonium immersed in Maldivian culture with a lineup that includes a performance by Varadhaana Beru, exhibits and live performances by the Maldivian students at the Academy of Design and lots of yummy delights such as Gulha, Havaadhuli Bis, Bhajiya, Majha, Roas Paan and Gerikiru Boakiba all on the house.
Bodu Beru translated from Divehi literally means Big Drums and is a very energetic form of Maldivian entertainment where everyone is invited to dance and clap along while the songs are going on. Bodu Beru which is actually a dance song starts with a slow beat and in due course would lead to a hyperactive, frenetic and tumultuous beat. The first and official Maldivian Bodu Beru group made in Sri Lanka, Varadhana Beru consisting of a group of young Maldivian students residing here will be performing on the night of the 26th bringing us Maldivian Traditional Music in its best form.
Given the vast number of Maldivian students studying at the Academy of Design, they too have partnered up with The Sooriya Village to showcase the designs of their students which have been influenced by traditional Maldivian arts, crafts and culture. The showcase will include an exhibition and live performances!
Out of the yummy delights you can expect to revel in Gulha, Havaadhuli Bis and Majha are savoury items made out of fish (their main ingredient!) and Roas Paan and Gerikiru Boakiba are sweet items with condensed milk that will titillate your taste buds.
The Sooriya Village, located in the heart of Colombo, provides amenities such as rehearsal suits, a top gear recording studio, library and research services, a tech based lecture room, a restaurant with mouth watering delights, dorms, tea/coffee/juice lounge, performance spaces and plenty of hang-out areas. Sooriya’s vision is to provide a facility for artists and art enthusiasts to nurture and explore the culture of arts delivering the best possible service and experience.
The Sooriya Village welcomes all you vibrant lovers of culture for a refreshing evening away from the daily hustle and bustle to enjoy the best of Maldivian culture.
