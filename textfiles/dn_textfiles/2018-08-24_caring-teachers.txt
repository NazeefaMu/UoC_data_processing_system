Caring for teachers

The group of students in the years between 60s and 70s of Sri Sumangala College Panadura shows gratitude in abundance. The bond between those students and their teachers is unique.
Teachers, who are in financial difficulties, receive their students’ attention very often. One such student is Dr. Dharmasiri Silva who is helping three of his former teachers financially.
The yearend lunch for the retired teachers is an event which is eagerly awaited by them. It is an occasion to recall the past memories when the teachers were together. However, this event depends on generous financial contributions by our past students towards this event.
Majority of teachers are in their twilight years. They need medical assistance and they are under medication due to aging. Consultant Physician Dr. Kosala De Silva due to his initiative along with other doctors, who were all Sumangaliyans, had organized several health camps for the retired teachers. The arrangement to purchase drugs at a special discount of 6 per cent from a private pharmacy is a big relief, as a big slice of the pension of the teachers is being spent on drugs. Dr. Kosala can be consulted at any time of the day for medical advice. He hardly charges a fee from retired teachers. This is a rare quality as majority of medical practitioners are equated with rupees and cents.
The retired teachers had the privilege of participating in two outings. The first tour was sponsored and organized by Anuruth Abeyratna, a successful entrepreneur.
It was a three day trip from February 3 to 6, 2011. The destination was Polonnaruwa. A comfortable luxury bus was provided and the journey was not tiring as teachers were singing along recalling the good old days when were together. The teachers were accommodated in a luxury resort. Teachers organized a reception in honour of Anuruth Abeyratna in appreciation for funding the trip and also working tirelessly to making the outing a memorable one.
The second outing was also organized by Anuruth Abeyratna, Tissa Illeperuma, and D. A. Perera. The latter two are also business magnates like Anuruth who spread their business wings to the Asian region.
It was a two day trip to Pasikuda after visiting Maduru Oya in the first leg. At Maduru Oya, the teachers had the opportunity to sighting the wild elephants in their natural habitat. Both outings were meticulously planned by sponsors attending to minute details depriving any omissions to be occurred.
As one of the participants summed up caring is a rare commodity in an era where the goal is always rupees and cents this trip was sponsored. Where by the aged one was in oasis enjoying the streams in the desert.
Another group of students organized a felicitation ceremony on December 27, 2015 for eleven of their former teachers at Laya Beach Hotel, Wadduwa. The amazing thing was that this group was from Australia.
It was a momentous occasion. We as teachers are happy to note that we are blessed with grateful pupils. Although they are thousands of miles away their hearts and minds are still with teachers. What matters is the thought. We had the privilege of enjoying a sumptuous lunch while listening to music. The grand finale of this event was the gift of Rs. 50,000 to each of eleven teachers who were invited to grace the occasion. This became handy for the low pensioners. Majority of teachers are not in the best health.
The second felicitation was held on December 29, 2017 by the same group of students. The venue was White Heaven Hotel, Talpitiya. Jayantha Silva, who had come from Australia in advance worked tirelessly to make this event success. He was aided by Dharmasiri Silva who generously gave one of his vehicles to visit elderly teachers and ensuring their participation for this event by providing transport facilities to them.
We also had the privilege of meeting our past students who had come from New Zealand, France, England, USA and Australia. Teachers were thrilled to see them. Each teacher was given a gift of some utility value. What was noteworthy were two felicitations were organized by a group of students from Australia and the Old Boys Association of Colombo. We as teachers will treasure all this. In the words of William James, “the deepest craving of human nature is the need to be appreciated”.
We wish to thank all past students and especially the following Dr. Dharmasiri Silva, Upali Wijesiri, Jayantha Silva, Ajith Silva, Ranjith Ananda and also the members of Colombo branch of Old Students Association.
