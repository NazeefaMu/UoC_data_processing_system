Army engage in Wellawatte rescue operations

 
The Armed Forces have been called to help with ongoing rescue operations in Wellawatte, where this morning a seven-storey building collapsed injuring as many as 19.

Rescue operations are still underway in Wellawatte, severely hampered by the rain.
Two floors of the building, located on Charlemont Road, Wellawatte, were occupied but the remaining seven were still under construction.
