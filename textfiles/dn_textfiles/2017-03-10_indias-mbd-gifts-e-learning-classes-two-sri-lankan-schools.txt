India's MBD gifts e-learning classes to two Sri Lankan schools

 India's MBD, one of the country's largest education companies, will gift two Sri Lankan schools with two integrated digital learning solutions.
The two schools are Nakkawatta Central college in Kuliyapitiya and Gannethena Maha Vidyalaya in Hingula Mawanella. This is part of the Group's objective is to encourage Sri Lankan students to venture into e-Learning, a new initiative by the Sri Lankan education authorities.
Valued at Rs 1.2 million, the first two e-learning classrooms were presented to Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam by MBD Group Managing Director Monica Malhotra Kandhari at the Education Ministry recently.
MBD Group, an ISO 9001:2008 certified company, is one of India's largest education companies with more than six decades of experience in the domain. Under the category of e-learning, MBD is offering a customised learning management system that consists of classroom-based training modules, interactive e-content, teacher support kit and other support services along with training teachers to get accustomed to newer methodologies of teaching and creating their own e-content.
“The system provides an environment for students to put their textual knowledge and practical skills to test and enhance their learning levels. Besides, various modern teaching methodologies have been incorporated to make learning a fun and effortless process. This aims to standardise teaching resources along with encouraging teachers to create their own e-content and assessments and make learning more receptive”, MBD Group Managing Director Monica Malhotra Kandhari said.
The m-learning solution from MBD is an extension of the traditional approach. For instance, the freely available Nytra app, an indigenously developed augmented reality app makes images and illustrations come alive in books with the help of animations and voice-overs. This app also supports all formats of digital content, videos and animations and works on Android, iOS and Windows-based mobile devices.
Several educational apps, such as ABCD Kids and Joy of Rhymes, developed by MBD are also available free of cost (at Google Play Store, iTunes Store, Windows Store) for end users. MBD recently launched Virtual Reality for K-12 education which was also appreciated by the learning and teaching community across India.
Along with this, all books published by MBD are available online in the form of interactive e-books; learners can access these from MBD e-Bookstore (www.octopuslearn.com) by paying a nominal fee.
MBD Group has received accreditation from the Sri Lankan Ministry of Education for more than 30 titles and projects, including Moderns ABC books for Grades 11 and 12; books of Physics, Chemistry and Biology for Grades 6, 7 and 8; Learnwell Computer books for Grades 1 to 8; Learnwell Science for Grades 6 to 8; and Web Designing books. A warehouse has been set up to ease the supply and delivery system in Sri Lanka. Last year, MBD donated science books worth Rs 1 million to the Colombo Municipal Council on the latter's celebration of 150 years of service; four of MBDs authors sponsored a science symposium in Colombo. Again this year, the Group will be distributing a hundred thousand exercise books.
MBD books will be available at local bookshops and libraries across Sri Lanka, through its key distributors. Currently the Group is engaged in creating books in the local language (Sinhalese) for Grades K to 12. There are plans to boost e-learning projects; more books are in the process of accreditation, too.
MBD Group is a leading education company with its presence across the globe, and publishes 50 million books a year and around 30 million notebooks.
Today, the Group has diversified into various industries including e-learning, m-learning, skill development, eco-friendly notebooks, capacity building, paper manufacturing, ICT infrastructure, hospitality, real estate, mall development and management.
