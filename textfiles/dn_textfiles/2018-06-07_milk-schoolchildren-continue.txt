Milk for schoolchildren to continue

The government will continue providing schoolchildren with milk packets daily, despite the increase in the market price of milk.
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, submitting a Cabinet paper on the above subject, received Cabinet approval to proceed with the daily milk programme.
Since 2013, chosen schools and special education units have been given 150ml milk packets worth Rs. 30 each, daily. The milk is provided by MILCO.
The milk programme was initiated to reduce the level of malnutrition among schoolchildren and its continuation is seen as an important measure in the fight against malnutrition.
