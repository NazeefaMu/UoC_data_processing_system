Youth to Sri Pada end in cop shed

Several youth on pilgrimage to Sri Pada carrying heroin and cannabis were arrested by the Hatton Police at dawn yesterday.
Hatton police said that sniffer dogs helped in these detections. Police were also able to detect cigarettes smuggled to Sri Lanka in their possession. The suspect youth are residents in Kegalle, Matale, Galle, Matara, Kalutara, Panadura and Avissawella and are in the age groups of 18 to 30. The suspect group of youth will be produced before the Hatton Magistrate's Court by police. Hatton Division SP Ravindra Ambeypitiya said six hundred pilgrims visiting Sri Pada with drugs and cannabis were arrested by police during the last three months.
They were fined by the Magistrate's court.
