Johnston’s asset declaration case: Trial fixed for November 13

The case filed against former Minister and MP Johnston Fernando for his failure to disclose his assets and liabilities was yesterday fixed for trial on November 13 by Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake.
Fernando was not present in court and was informed by the Bribery Commission that he had been remanded by the Kurunegala High Court over another case.
The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption Bribery Commission alleged that the former Minister had failed to declare his assets and liabilities for two years since 2010.
The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed charges against Fernando in the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court under Section 9 of the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law No. 1 of 1975.
The Magistrate ordered prison officials to produce Fernando before court on the next trial date.
