“JMC have proved their approach to education by producing competent, skillful intellectuals and professionals who values the proud Sri Lankan culture and updated with the latest developments in technology.”
Education is a universal right and every child is entitled to receive the best education made available to them. However, many schools around the country tend to steer away from ensuring that a child receives a learning experience that is beyond that of simply graduating with a paper credential.
JMC’s whole objective is to provide quality education to children at an affordable cost. When a student enroll JMC as a kindergarten student the academic education will be provided up to advanced level through JMC College International.

“Additional academic education needs will be satisfied through the JMC Saturday School and a Tuition Segment, Information Technology education will be covered through JMC School of Computing, Professional education will be covered though JMC Professional Education Faculty, language education will be covered though JMC Language Faculty and Degree path will be covered though JMC Graduate School,” he said.
JMC ensures quality is maintained focusing on a child-centered education, where each and every student receives individual attention. This means that beginning from the moment a child enrolls at JMC, the entire context of learning and development is built, allowing them to face the real world and not simply limit their knowledge to the pages of a book.
JMC has provided all the necessary infrastructure to students in order to facilitate a better-quality education. Further, extra-curricular activities from Sports meet, Art and Craft Exhibition, Annual concert, Fun fair, Wesak, Ramazan, Nawa Rathri and Christmas celebrations to competitions such as oratory, debating, dancing, singing, and IT literacy are being organized to identify and develop different skills of JMC students.

Thus, the final JMC products are both academically sound, skillful and filled with positive attitudes. JMC has produced 9 A’s in O/L and 3 A’s in A/ L showing their excellence in academic studies. JMC past year 2018 was a remarkable year for JMC. Twenty years back when JMC started the International School in Colombo 09 branch, there was a small 6 year old student, Tharindu Perera in the first batch. The student made the history by becoming a Chartered accountant in year 2018 by studying only at JMC.
JMC, has also embraced the need to offer extra classes covering core subjects and taking the concept to a whole new level, where each school operates as yet another separate schooling entity that takes place every Saturday and accommodates a different set of teachers, a Principal and students who come from various other schools.
Technology being an essential element in current context, children must be given a proper guidance from inception. Thus, JMC School of computing has provided a separate Kids IT Academy platform to all students realizing the requirement.
Technology being a trendy feature, JMC has already taken major steps to establish a web-based student management system (www.jmc.lk) to have a better coordination. Through this web site portal JMC has initiated an online registration platform which allows parents to enroll their child without visiting the school.
