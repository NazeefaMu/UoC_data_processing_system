Riu Sri Lanka: For families and friends

Excerpts from Thanzyl Thajudeen’s interview with RIU Sri Lanka General Manager, Giorgio Chiarel
Q: What inspired RIU to choose Sri Lanka for its first resort in the Asian region?
We’ve been in the family holiday business for several decades with an important presence in Europe, the Caribbean, Mexico, Central America and North Africa. It felt like a definite must to expand into the diversified Asian market. After much research we strongly believed Sri Lanka to be the ideal destination for our first hotel in Asia. Sri Lanka is known all over the world as the pearl of the continent and the country certainly does fulfill all the characteristics of a very good tourism destination. It has a rich history in tourism and is experiencing a significant yearly growth in the industry. The island has lovely weather, a varied landscape, blissful nature, wildlife, mountains, beaches, waterfalls and rivers, natural parks, jungles, ancient historic sites, beach sports, adventures and so much more. Not to forget the wonderful, welcoming and charming people. Having been to many countries, I personally believe that Sri Lanka is a perfect holiday destination. You have everything here!
The key to our hotels is the philosophy of service provided by our employees. We are known for offering a very warm and professional service and for making each and every guest feel welcome and at home. To provide this in our hotel in Sri Lanka,we have built a great team in the hotel, in which the great majority are locals.
Q:  Riu Sri Lanka is part of one of world’s leading hospitality chains. Could you tell us more?
The hotel Riu Sri Lanka is part of the international RIU Hotels & Resorts chain. We started our business back in 1953 with a small hotel in Playa de Palma, on the Spanish island of Mallorca, and in the 80s opened the first hotel outside the Balearic Islands, on the island of Gran Canaria. The hotel exhibited a great success and today the Canary Islands still are one of RIU’s main destinations with almost 20 hotels located there. In the early 90s we opened our first international hotel in the Dominican Republic and it was the first step in RIU Hotels’ impressive growth in America where we currently have over 40 hotels.
Today RIU Hotels & Resorts has almost 100 hotels in 19 countries which welcome over 4 million guests a year and provide jobs to more than 26,500 employees. We are currently the world’s 29th ranked chain, one of the Caribbean’s most popular and the third largest in Spain.
In the next two years, we will be opening a 174-room Riu Palace hotel and a 248-room Riu Classic hotel in two islets in the Maldives and the first 24hr all inclusive resort in Dubai.
Q:  How would you describe the ‘all-inclusive’ experience at Riu Sri Lanka?
I think that it is safe to say that we have mastered the ‘all-inclusive’ after over 20 years of experience in this concept. The first all inclusive RIU hotel opened in 1996 in the Dominican Republic and today, over 70% of our hotels provide this service. Everything is available at any time for our guests.
We believe that guests shouldn’t have that extra headache of worrying about the extra costs or the need to carry their wallet around when having a wonderful vacation. From the moment guests check-in and wear theall inclusive wristband, they have full access to all meals and snacks served in our main and themed restaurants, beverages at all bars, sports and activities, and entertainment programs. There is also free Wi-Fi throughout the hotel. We have three swimming pools and a children's pool with water slides, free gym, steam bath and whirlpool bath.
Guests can have a special dinner arranged in the themed restaurant based on reservation. All our services are of international standards.
Q:  Riu Sri Lanka is ‘the’ hotel for families and groups of friends. How would you describe this?
The RIU hotels worldwide fall into four categories namely Riu Classic, Riu Plaza, Riu Palace, and RiuClubHotel. Hotel Riu Sri Lanka is part of the classic hotel category which are holiday hotels designed to offer the best services for families, couples, groups of friends or guests traveling on their own. We are a five-star rated hotel, and welcomeall kinds of guests. It is the perfect choice for a family break, an unforgettable honeymoon or a holiday with friends. Overall, to enjoy a unique experience.
We have comfortable rooms, excellent facilities and services for leisure and relaxation, as well as varied and delicious food and drink. We have a variety of music, dance, live shows, various entertainment programs and much more that guests can indulge in all day. Adults can enjoy a wide range of unlimited local and imported beverages free of charge at our Nuwaralobby bar, Lounge Bar, Karaoke Pacha discotheque and Flamingos pool bar. Our philosophy truly lives and thrives in the all-inclusive concept.
Q: Riu Sri Lanka features many restaurants that offer a variety of specialties. Could you describe the gastronomy?
We have two main restaurants, RitiPanna and Ceylon, and three themed restaurants. The main restaurants offer a buffet with a large variety, from Sri Lankan and Asian to Italian and Mediterranean dishes, in addition to continental breakfast and snacks at the barbeque restaurant Saute. We have live cooking stations and irresistible dessert corners. We also offer a themed buffet dinner three times a week. Guests from all nationalities, especially the locals, enjoy our food variety very much.
In addition to this offering, guest can also choose to have dinner at our Asian restaurant Kaori or Italian at La Forchetta.
Our executive chef is from Spain and our assistant chef is a Sri Lankan national who is well experienced and has worked in several different countries.
Q:  Riu Sri Lanka is probably the best hotel for families with kids. What can the guests expect?
The hotel definitely stands for a full-on fun package made for families with kids too. At RiuLand, kids can experience adventures and have an unforgettable time under the supervision of our RiuLand activity coordinators. We organize diverse programs and theme days for our youngest guests, divided in two different age groups: 4 to 7 years, and 8 to 12 years. We have a large, fantastic kids pool with a beautifully built –in playground. We have a swimming pool built with slides that kids enjoy very much and at the same time, are very safe. We also have a pool that’s meant just for water games and competitions. We have play areas inside the hotel too. They get to also play, learn and dance together with our mascot Calú who is a friendly sea turtle that was‘born’ on one of RIU’s wonderful beaches.
We also have our creative programRiuArt for adults and children over 12 years of age where they can express their creativity in a relaxed environment with no time pressure, creating designs with colors, shapes, structures and just about anything, and an in-house drawing expert is available to guide them.
