Wild elephant damages agrarian services centre

A wild elephant had recently entered the Karaitivu Agrarian Services Centre premises and damaged the centre's parapet wall and crops.
Elephants have found their way into villages of the Addalaichenai, Akkaraipattu, Karaitivu, Sammanthurai, Irakkamam, Alayadivembu, Thirukkovil and Pottuvil Divisional Secretariat areas in the Ampara district.
Wild elephants have damaged paddy fields, other crops and home gardens and as a result, the livelihood of the public is affected.
Parents complained that the education of their children was also affected due to this prevalent situation. Villagers urge the authorities responsible to set up an electric fence in order to prevent wild elephants from entering their villages.
