‘Hub point’ launches modern, innovative co working office spaces

The global movement of co working has arrived in Sri Lanka with the launch of Hub point; a company that provides purpose-built shared office spaces in Colombo.
The first Hub point office, located in Colombo 1 – close to the World Trade Centre, offers dynamic corporate environments with all the modern amenities. Hub point appeals to companies and entrepreneurs looking for professional office spaces with none of the hassle of expensive leases, high upfront costs or long term commitments. Co working office spaces offer the convenience and flexibility required by a growing start-up industry in Colombo.
Hub point members will enjoy features such as security, 24/7 utilities (AC, WIFI, coffee machines), flexible contracts and more in a shared office environment. Co working gives you all the benefits of a full-time office, but is more convenient as you only pay for the number of desks you use. Contemporary concepts, modern interior design and custom-made furniture create aesthetic and functional spaces you will want to work in. Vibrant greenery and plenty of natural light enhance working spaces helping your employees to feel more comfortable, energized and productive. Members can also use the conference room facilities provided for client and company meetings.
Hub point was founded by Thusith Muthumala, Talal Rafi and Thasim Rafi, who, influenced by their education in the UK, were determined to bring a transformative change to the work culture in Sri Lanka. Thusith Muthumala has a wealth of expertise in the corporate sector as head of a reputed company. Talal Rafi and Thasim Rafi have a varied and extensive experience across digital media, consultancy and branding. They now look forward to using their experience to transform city working with a new easy, enjoyable and innovative co working concept.
