Japanese government to provide firefighting gear

The Japanese government has decided to provide eight fire engines along with firefighting equipment, to Export Processing Zones (EPZs) in Katunayake, Biyagama, Seethawaka and Wathupitiwala, where more than 100,000 employees are working.
The equipment donated by local governments in Japan would be utilised for the safety of not only EPZs, but adjacent areas as well. The grant contract for the Project for Upgrading Fire Units in Export Processing Zones (EPZs) of Sri Lanka amounting US$ 90,778 (approx. Rs. 14.1 million) under the scheme Grant Assistance for Grassroots Human Securities Project, was signed on March 20, at the Board of Investment (BOI) head office in Colombo, between Japanese Ambassador to Sri Lanka Kenichi Suganuma and BOI Director-General Duminda Ariyasinghe.
Ariyasinghe said, “BOI acts as the first point of contact for investors who intend to set up projects in manufacturing, infrastructure, tourism, agriculture, IT-related services or other chosen sectors in Sri Lanka. To ensure safety and security of the people in BOI Zones, BOI Fire Units are based in the Katunayake, Biyagama, Seethawaka and Wathupitiwala Export Processing Zones.”
“Every effort is being made to provide a secured working environment for a considerable number of workers and factories located within these zones. In 2014, BOI received five firefighting vehicles from the Japanese government, which are now used in several EPZs. Through this new project, in which we would receive another set of eight reconditioned fire engines, BOI could enhance fire units at BOI EPZs, as well as factories outside those zones. We thank the Japanese government.”
