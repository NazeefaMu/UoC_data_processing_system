Innovation Towards Sustainable Agricultural Productivity

Since of 1990, the Agriculture Faculty of the Jaffna University has endured untold hardship and evacuation and now, after years of handicap, the faculty has ultimately returned to its official home, after a quarter century with effect from the beginning of the faculty.
It is remarkable that this faculty initiated by late Professor Alagaiah Thurairaja and a like-minded progressive movement on December 3, 1990, in Kilinochchi; for a period of seven years, was in total disarray, wandering about with uncertainty. In 1998, the faculty began functioning in the University of Jaffna and until 2014, continued in a state of instability and privation.
Enduring hardships

Notwithstanding the hardships endured, graduates of the university's Agriculture Faculty are in gainful employment here and abroad in respectable and responsible offices. For this achievement, the faculty is indebted to the united and untiring effort of the staff who helped shape the formidable personalities who are now to be reckoned with. We remember their selfless services continuously. The following were the deans in chronological order from the inception of the faculty under whose consistent guidance and direction, the prevailing status of the faculty was achieved. They are; Prof. K. Kandaih, Prof. S. Mohanadas, Prof. A. Navaratnarajah, Eng. R. Vijayaratnam, Prof. S. Rajadurai, Dr. S. Sivamathy, Prof. G. Mihunthan and Prof. M. Thushyanthy.
Having finally returned to its prescribed permanent location, the Agriculture Faculty proposes to persevere towards compensating for the loss of time and usurped opportunities and targets in the agricultural sector of the region.
Inaugural conference
The Agriculture Faculty, in its jubilee year, conducted an inaugural conference titled 'International Conference on Dry Zone Agriculture' (ICDA). It was intended to bring together eminent researchers of the local and international community of all disciplines related to agricultural science. The main focus of the conference was to give priority for dry zone agriculture with special emphasis on agriculture and environment by providing a platform for delegates to disseminate their research findings.

The third international research conference with reference to dry zone agriculture has been scheduled to be held at the auditorium at the Agriculture Faculty from November 1-2 at Ariviyalnagar, Kilinochchi. The faculty acknowledges with appreciation, the contribution of the Indian Government for the infrastructure which is an integral part of the faculty currently.
In view of the needs of changing times, local and foreign professors, professionals, scholars, young researchers and students would attend this conference titled 'Innovation Towards Sustainable Agricultural Productivity.'
In this event, which will be chaired by the Agriculture Faculty Dean, the special guest will be Science, Technology and Research Minister Susil Premajayantha. The chief guest will be Jaffna University Vice Chancellor Prof. R. Vigneswaren.
The conference commences at 8.30 am on November 1. Academic Affairs Director and Horticulture Professor at Annamali University, Tamil Nadu, India, Professor K. Manivannanan is scheduled to deliver the plenary address.
The following dignitaries shall deliver keynote addresses. Prof. G. L. L. Pradeepa Silva of the Department of Animal Science at Peradeniya University, Prof. Jeevika Weerahewa of the Department of Agricultural Economics and Business Management at Peradeniya University, Prof. Terence Madhujith of the Department of Food Science and Technology at Peradeniya University and Dr. Meethika Vinthanage of the Faculty of Applied Sciences at Sri Jayawardenepura University.

On the second day of the conference, the theme address will be delivered by American University of Nigeria Dean and Professor of Economics John E. Leonard. Following this, UNICEF Health and Nutrition Program Officer N. Sutharman will speak on 'Contemporary Issues-Sustainable Development Goal' (SDG). The day will end with a panel discussion on ‘Contemporary Issues and Future Engagement of Issues in Dry Zone Agriculture,’ chaired by Professor. C. Sivayoganathan.
The panel will consist of Prof. Manivannan, Jaffna University Graduate Studies Dean Prof. G. Mihunthan, World Bank Development Economist Geeva Perumalpillai, Agriculture Research Additional Director Dr. S. J. Arasakesary, HNB Northern Region Senior Regional Head S. Sunthareswaran and UNICEF Health and Nutrition Programme Officer N. Sutharman.
In the above international conference to be held in six sittings, in each sitting, researchers will be submitting their findings under distinct independent subtitles. Thus, nationally and internationally, a cumulative number of 66 research papers are to be submitted.
Climate Change and Agriculture, Agricultural Economics, Post-Harvest Technology, Farm Mechanization and Irrigation Water Management, Applied Economics, Agro-forestry and Crop Production, Food Science and Technology; Livestock, Aquaculture and Fisheries; Plant Protection and Biotechnology and Soil, Water and Environmental Management, are the sub-themes under which the nine sittings will be conducted.
For prolonged viability and feasibility of this conference, it is imperative that regional entrepreneurs take an active role in all its aspects.
It is essential that the Agriculture Faculty should endeavour to promote both regional and national development, particularly in the field of agriculture. In that sense, future research conferences shall form the base for envisaged development.
Jaffna University Agriculture Faculty Senior Lecturer K. Umashankar took five and a half years to finish his degree in Agriculture which would have otherwise taken 3-4 years to complete. He persevered like many of those who chose to study in the Agriculture Faculty of the University of Jaffna. The faculty, initially based in Jaffna, had to be moved many a time as the war front caught up with them.
“At times, we were functioning out of private homes,” recalled Umashankar.
During the final phases of the war, the Faculty functioned out of Jaffna and though the peninsula practiced intensive agriculture, it was not the best place to set up an agriculture faculty in.
“There was no space for our farms; we could not conduct our practical examinations or trials. We also felt that the other academics in the University would treat us differently. We all wanted to go back to Kilinochchi,” he said.
During the last few years, the faculty was finally able to move back to Kilinochchi and they are rebuilding their legacy from scratch.
We recently got more buildings and though we have 27 permanent staff and 30 temporary, we are still short of human resources and other facilities, said Umashankar; but more importantly, he noted that they still have not been able to deliver on their purpose of serving society and contributing to regional development through their work.
The Northern Province though mostly agrarian has shown very little interest in pursuing agriculture as a field of study. Umashankar pointed out that 70 percent of their students were from the South and that those who did end up in their faculty, were the ones with too low a Z Score to enter medicine or science.
“They do not choose agriculture here. They are here because they have no other alternative, thus, we don’t see the passion towards the field. Naturally, we have less people contributing to agriculture in the area,” said Umshankar.
Over the years, the faculty has only produced six agri-entrepreneurs, a handful working in the Department of Agriculture and around 20-25 who have taken up agriculture part time to take care of their family farms. The rest have either chosen to go abroad or get into other fields such as banking or NGO work.
In countries like India and the west, students choose agriculture; they have an interest in it and thus they contribute to the progress of the field, said Umashankar. This was important to ensure the food security of a country currently preoccupied with being consumers, rather than producers.
The third International Dry Zone Conference, thus, is seen as a positive step to give focus to the Faculty and create more interest in the field.
“When we first started three years ago, academics from other universities were surprised to know that the University of Jaffna even had an Agriculture Faculty. In our first year, we only got around 20 papers, then it gradually increased to 35 and now we have 66!” said Umashankar.
“We are progressing. In the next 2-3 years, we will get enough papers and the best would be sent in for general publication and used for policy recommendation purposes,” he added.
The Conference is also seen as a good opportunity for the faculty’s students to interact with other academics in the field and get the exposure they need. For the moment, however, it signifies that the Agriculture Faculty at the University of Jaffna has finally arrived on the map.
