SLASA Batticaloa branch urges legal action against Thera

The Sri Lanka Administrative Service Association (SLASA) Batticaloa branch held a demonstration on Thursday urging legal action against Ven. Ampitiye Sumanarathana Thera of the Mangalaramaya Temple in Batticaloa for allegedly trying to assault Eravurpattu Divisional Secretary N.Vilvaratnam.
SLASA Batticaloa branch officer Al Ameen speaking to the Daily News yesterday, said it also made a written request to the Eastern Province Senior DIG urging immediate action against the incident.
“We strongly condemn the attempted assault by the monk on the Eravurpattu (Chenkalady) Divisional Secretary over an issue of cutting down several branches of a Bo-tree. This is not the first time that this Buddhist monk behaved violently. It was not long ago that a female Divisional Secretary was threatened by him in the same manner. We have been tolerating his aggressive behaviour for a long time in order to protect social harmony,” he commented.
A video clip, which was doing the rounds on social media, showed how the monk allegedly behaving in an aggressive manner and trying to assault the DS while using abusive language. When contacted by the Daily News, Eravurpattu Divisional Secretary Vilvaratnam said he lodged a complaint with the Eravur Police that the monk tried to assault him. The incident took place around 2.30pm on Tuesday and it had also been reported to the Batticaloa District Secretary.
The Divisional Secretary explained that he gave approval to cut down several branches of the Bo-tree situated in a private land on the request of the residents in the area, adding that the approval was given after obtaining the Forest Conservation Department’s recommendation.
“The monk objected stating that the tree has a religious value and we are sad that this incident happened. This particular land had been used as an Army Camp previously and it was released back to the people recently. The people requested to cut down several branches as it blocked the electricity supply lines,” he commented.
When contacted by the Daily News, Eravur Police OIC said the incident was being investigated but refused to give any details.
SLASA Batticaloa branch officer Al Ameen requested his superiors to take this matter up with the relevant authorities and ensure the public servants’ security to work according to the rule of law. “We seek the Government’s intervention to stop these unlawful influences,” he said.
