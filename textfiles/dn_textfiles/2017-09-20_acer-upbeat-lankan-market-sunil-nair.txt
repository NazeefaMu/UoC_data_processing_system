Acer upbeat in Lankan market - Sunil Nair

Since the last two years Acer has focused heavily on Sri Lanka, said Sunil Nair General Manager Sales, Acer Computer (Singapore)Pte Ltd at the Launch of the latest Intel 8th gen CPU based Notebooks in Sri Lanka on Thursday.
The reason for this is that it is one of the unique markets in the sense that Sri Lankan market is one of the few in the world that is growing double digit for the IT scenario.
“ In 2015, our market share was less than 3 per cent and it is over 18 percent today. We are the top three brands in Sri Lanka and have been the first to bring the latest technology to the Sri Lankan market.”
He said they launched the Core i7 7th generation first in the Sri Lankan market last year and this year the 8th generation processor too has been launched in Sri Lanka and is ready to buy. “So our focus is not only to bring the latest technology to Sri Lanka first, but to ensure that we are addressing all market segments.
So we not only address the consumer segment we are also into small and medium business and also into government.
So we have won large projects and last year we won the all in one project from the Ministry of Agriculture and recently we have received a large notebook tender from the ICTA so we are penetrating well and are very well accepted by the Sri Lankan consumers.
In the future too we will continue to invest in Sri Lanka and expand our product portfolio so that we have projectors audio visual communications we will also bring in servers and storing solutions and as the months go by you will see more product portfolio from Acer to be lanced in Sri Lanka,” Nair added.
Acer launched a wide range of products which included Intel’s 8th gen CPU based Notebooks in Sri Lanka –Aspire E5, Spin 5, Swift 3 , Swift 5, Switch 7 black edition at the event.
