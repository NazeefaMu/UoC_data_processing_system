Loan scheme for electric three wheelers

Tuk-tuk,three wheeler, trishaw, auto-rickshaw - no matter what you call them, those, three-wheeled autos are to be replaced soon with environmental friendly electric three wheelers under the Enterprise Sri Lanka: Blue Green imitative.
Sri Lanka’s 1.5 million three wheeler drivers will get an opportunity to become owners of brand new electric three wheelers under a scheme proposed by Minister Mangala Samaraweera’s maiden budget in parliament on Thursday.
It has proposed to provide loan facilities for leasing electric three wheelers in the ratio of 10:90.
Anyone can purchase electric three wheelers by paying 10 percent of its value up front under this scheme.
The government will also take measures to export the used fossil fuel trishaws to needy countries like Bangladesh, as this country has already expressed willingness to import those used trishaws from Sri Lanka.
Further, the green three wheeler service will be made a mode of transport for foreign tourists by providing necessary training for tuk tuk drivers with licence from the Tourist board.
Although riding in a tuk-tuk at present has become more messy than comfortable, this new initiative will make it a convenient trade of transport and brand for a true, Sri Lanka experience with a smile!
