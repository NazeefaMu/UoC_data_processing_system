Where the world ends

The elephant he was in pursuit of, after being severely wounded and driven back into the forest, reappeared close to Major Haddock, who fired and immediately moved to one side; his servant, who had stood behind him, then fired; and the animal turned off towards Major Haddock, whom he seized, threw down, and trampled to death. This was the work of a moment; for the servant flew to the spot, and, while he was raising the mangled remains of his gallant master, the elephant walked slowly off. Sir Robert Wilmot Horton, Governor of Ceylon, has erected a stone pillar, with an inscription, to mark the precise spot where this melancholy catastrophe occurred.

Jonathan Forbes makes such a reference to Sir Robert Wilmot Horton in his work, Eleven Years in Ceylon. Sir Robert does not sound much familiar to contemporary Sri Lankans, most of who have already been to the national park named after him: Horton Plains.
If you are in Colombo, sketching plans to reach this destination, be mindful of one thing: it is the destination that is cool, more than the journey. Whether it is private or public transport, the journey is going to be a long, arduous, one unless you opt for a helicopter. Travelling by train will be cost-effective, but remember to book the seats in advance. Neglect such a small thing and be ready to travel for eight hours from Colombo Fort to Ohiya.
Sunrise over the plains is a burgundy spectacle. The almost snowy peaks of the early morning hold the colour of the sky. The grass is wet and tangles the grass in verdant greenery. Horton Plains is blessed with other attractions such as World’s End and Baker’s Fall. The birdsong is inconstant, but the wildlife presence is very much felt.
Located at an altitude of 6000 feet above sea level, you need to be prepared for a great climb in order to reach the World’s End. En route, you will hear stories about young couples who have committed suicide on the World’s End. The more depressing thing, however, is the sight of garbage sprinkled across the plains. You have two choices on such an occasion: either lash out the fellow Sri Lankans or volunteer to gather the dirt into a bag to freshen the picturesque plains.
Whatever the choice you may pick, it is going to be about nine kilometres if you really plan to reach the World’s End. And that means a walk of six hours – or so, depending on your pace. That walk with the cool breeze wafting across is not that strenuous like walking in the Colombo heat. You will still feel exhausted, but all that tiredness will dissolve into one of accomplishment as you finally reach the peak. Draw a breath, steel yourself and fix your gaze downwards.
And take a while to explore the souls of those of us, the humans, who had the courage to take that lethal leap.
Horton Plains is home to two els: leopard and sambar. You might have a chance to pay a call upon either of them, despite sighting a leopard is a rare prospect. Your chance of encountering a leopard is high if you choose to spend the night at the Plains. Leopard and Sambar have an interconnection. The Sambar is constantly on a vigil about the leopards, and the latter takes about 10 days to finish off a carcass of the former. That leaves much room for us humans to dread. Rather oddly, however, their taste buds are more tailored for sambar flesh than that of humans. A sambar squints at you for a moment and will look forward to a bribe of a grub.
If you have plans to spend a day or two, be armed with winter clothes. At night the temperature tends to go down to the minus. However wintry it may feel, try a bath in the freezing water and you will get accustomed to the cold weather.
Before Sir Robert Horton stumbled upon here, the plains were known as Maha Thenna (Great Open Plains), because of the meadow extraordinaire. During the times of the British, the area was not much developed. Only the horse-riders could access the jungle. The travellers mostly belonged to the colonial elite who were in pursuit of game.
There is so much to watch out for in Horton Plains thanks to its rich flora and fauna. And that is exactly why you should take extra care of your clothing, footwear in particular. Put on proper footwear; because you have several hours to walk, for one, and on the other hand you might be greeted by unwelcome earthly creatures ready to feast on your skin.
