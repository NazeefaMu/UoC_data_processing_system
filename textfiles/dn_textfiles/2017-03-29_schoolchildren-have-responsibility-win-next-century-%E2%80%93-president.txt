Schoolchildren have responsibility to win the next century – President

President Maithripala Sirisena said school children have the responsibility of winning the next century by building on past experiences.
Addressing the centenary celebration of Ferguson High School, Ratnapura, on Monday, where he was the chief guest, the President said, “As evident, the history of a country is the foundation for what would happen in that country in the future. In this current era when everything depends on money, we should understand the challenge to win not only exams but also life,” he pointed out.
“The school children in Sri Lanka excel in passing exams, but we cannot be satisfied with their discipline,” he said, citing several recent examples.
A souvenir stamp was issued to mark the 100th anniversary of the school. The President presented gifts to the students who demonstrated outstanding skills. He declared open the newly built indoor stadium of the school and visited the stalls of the exhibition, organized to mark the anniversary.
President Sirisena presented a plant to the Principal of the school, M. Galagama, symbolizing of the project to plant 4,000 trees, under the programme of Sustainable Schools.
He also presented a notice which was made by the Environment Ministry.
The notice which has been designed to raise awareness about the environmental protection will be exhibited at every school. Two students of the school presented an environmental-friendly bag to the President.
This bag has been produced by the Ferguson High School. The Principal of the school presented a souvenir to the President at this occasion.
Ministers Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, W. D. J. Senevirathne, Deputy Minister Dunesh Gankanda, Governor Marshal Perera and the Chief Minister of Sabaragamuwa Province Maheepala Herath were among those participated in this ceremony.
