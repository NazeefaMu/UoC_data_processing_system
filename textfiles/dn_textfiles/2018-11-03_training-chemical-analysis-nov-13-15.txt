Training on chemical analysis from Nov. 13 - 15

A training programme has been organised by the Industrial Technology Institute (ITI) on ‘Single laboratory analytical method validation and measurement uncertainty in chemical analysis’ from November 13 to 15 at the ITI Main Auditorium.
Uncertainty calculation and Analytical Method Validation (AMV) is a long-felt need in the country, mainly in the fields of food, medicines, agriculture, environmental studies etc. Any laboratory wishing to obtain ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation is required to estimate uncertainties of measurement in laboratory tests or calibrations covered by their scope of accreditation, a release stated.
ITI is a fully government-own multidisciplinary research and testing institution, where the laboratories are equipped with state-of-the-art analytical instruments and expert analysts. ITI’s worldwide acceptance is evident through ISO 9001 and ISO 17025 certifications and SLAB accreditation. This training is organised by ITI with the view of sharing the expert knowledge and experience in AMV and uncertainty calculation.
This three-day training programme will help participants understand method validation and its requirements; select and apply the statistics required during method validation; use of appropriate types of method validation studies and appreciate and understand the links with measurement uncertainty. This training provides users a combination of lectures and interactive exercises with real case studies to take participants through the process of calculating uncertainties.
