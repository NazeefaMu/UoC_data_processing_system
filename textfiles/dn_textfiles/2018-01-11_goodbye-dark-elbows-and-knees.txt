Goodbye dark elbows and knees

Pigmented areas are hard to clean by scrubbing with soaps as you will make the skin feel dry instead of making it look even.
If you’re someone who is not much strict with their hygiene routine, then you are on the verge of facing this issue.
Friction is another reason. Surprised, right? Yes, when the body faces any sort of friction in these areas they naturally build up a thick layer to protect the sensitive dermis in the underlying layers.
Sunlight is responsible for darkening of the skin. Dead cells absorb more rays and become darker. So, try covering your knees and elbows with more SPF.
Other factors include dry skin, obesity, genetic factors, hormonal imbalance, an increase of dead skin and melanin pigment secretion.
Tips:
Lemon

You just have to apply it to the dark area and leave them for 10 minutes. Then rinse it with water. If you have a sensitive skin you can also add some rose water to it to dilute the solution.
Yogurt
 
 
Lactic acid is great for lightening the skin tone by moisturizing and cleansing the skin. All you need to do is mix the yogurt with some vinegar to make a fine paste. Now apply it to the affected area and keep it for 10 minutes. Rinse it properly with water and apply some moisturizer.
Sugar
