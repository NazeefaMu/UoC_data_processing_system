Nawaloka College of higher studies introduces  health science pathway programme in SL

Nawaloka College of Higher Education (NCHS) has introduced a new uniLink Diploma in Health Science for the first time in Sri Lanka.
This diploma of which the duration is eight months is a direct pathway to the second year of a degree in Health Science at the Swinburne University, Australia and Malaysia.
The syllabus of the Diploma is similar to that of the first year of a conventional degree. As the classes are smaller, the lecturers get to engage better with the students and pay close and individual attention to them and assist when and where necessary. 
“We view this UniLink Diploma as a timely opportunity where both education and health sectors are concerned.
"NCHS has a great relationship with Swinburne University in Australia and we are associated with Nawaloka Hospitals PLC as well, which is the first fully-fledged private hospital in Sri Lanka.
"We are excited to be offering the future of Sri Lanka the opportunity to benefit from this relationship,” said CEO of NCHS, Victor Ramanan, commenting on the uniLink Diploma. 
NCHS is a guaranteed pathway to the Swinburne University of Technology and will open the door to a future filled with the latest and best trends in Business, IT, Engineering and Health Science.

The facilities at NCHS are built according to the specifications of the partner universities, ensuring that the students have nothing but the best!
