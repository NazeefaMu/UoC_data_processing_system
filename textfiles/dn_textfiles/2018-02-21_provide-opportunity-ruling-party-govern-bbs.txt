Provide opportunity for ruling party to govern: BBS

All political parties which ruled the country over the past seven decades should be responsible for the present situation in the country. The present political and economic crisis is the result of those narrow-sighted, power-centred and power-craving politicians, Bodu Bala Sena Organisation Leader Ven. Galagodatte Gnanasara Thera said.
Ven Gnanasara Thera, addressing the media yesterday, said both the country and people are stagnating without witnessing any progress as a result of the political crisis. But at this juncture, power-craving politicians and their parties are trying to get the lion’s share, he said.
“As a result, the country is falling back day by day. Whatever the ruling party is, it should be given necessary opportunities and facilities by other parties to rule the country without pulling its legs. Today, the country marks the 200 years of the historic Uva Wellassa riot. It is significant that that the situation which prevailed 200 years ago can be seen even today,” the Thera said.
The Thera urged President Maithripala Sirisena to exercise the powers of the Executive Presidency aiming to gain political and economic stability.
“There should be one leader in the country. The country might fall back when there are many rulers or when there isn’t a ruler. It can be seen that there are many rulers today.”
The Thera added that there should be national policies for the county. In line with implementing national policies, it is necessary to implement people-friendly policies, he added.
