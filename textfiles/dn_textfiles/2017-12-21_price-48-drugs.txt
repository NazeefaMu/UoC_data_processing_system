Price of 48 drugs up

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne stated that the price of 48 drugs had been raised only by five percent.
This is to prevent local importers from incurring losses due to the continuous rise in the price of medicine in the global market.
According to Minister Senaratne, the prices were raised in accordance with a request made by local pharmaceutical companies which import drugs. The importers are making a loss due to the price increase in drugs in the global market.
The price increase will be valid for a period of one year. Thereafter, there will be no price increase again even if the price of drugs in the global market increases again in the future within one year. The prices of 48 drugs reduced significantly on October 21, 2016, he said.
Earlier, the price of a paracetamol tablet was Rs. 1.30. Now it is only Rs. 1.37 – increased by only seven cents. All pharmacies should sell drugs according to the prices stipulated in the Special Gazette Notification 2049/31 of December 14.
The National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) will conduct raids to nab pharmacies which sell drugs at higher prices than gazetted, he added.
