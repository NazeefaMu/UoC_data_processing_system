Turkey supports 3,000 Jaffna children

The Turkish government handed over school bags and stationery to 3,000 children in Jaffna on April 22.
The event was held at the Velanai Central College. The project was initiated by State Minister of Child Affairs Vijayakala Maheswaran and financed by the Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency (TKA), the official aid agency of Turkey.
Turkish Ambassador to Sri Lanka Tunca Özçuhadar said, “This donation may be a small drop in the ocean, but it can have a remarkable impact on the children’s enthusiasm to study.” This event also reflects the Turkish people’s solidarity with the children of Sri Lanka, as it coincided with the April 23 ‘Sovereignty and Children’s Day’ in Turkey.
Turkey has been providing humanitarian aid to Sri Lanka for more than a decade. In 2006, Turkey funded a large-scale housing project in Midigama, Matara, where 450 houses were built for the victims of the devastating Tsunami. In 2015, Turkey helped build the 'Sri Lanka-Turkey Friendship Village,' with 100 houses for the IDPs in Mannar.
