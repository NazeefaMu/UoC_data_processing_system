Significant decrease in dengue patients

Only 5,196 dengue patients had been reported from all parts of the country as of September 21 which is a significant decrease in the number of dengue patients when compared to the number (40,862) reported in July, Epidemiology Unit sources said.
According to the sources, 154,529 dengue patients and nearly 400 dengue deaths had been reported from all parts of the country as of September 21. This is the highest number of dengue patients and dengue deaths reported in Sri Lankan history.
Dengue could increase again due to the ongoing Eastern monsoon rains. There is a risk of increasing dengue patients in districts such as Colombo, Gampaha, Kalutara, Kurunegala, Puttalam, Ratnapura, Kegalle, Galle, Matara, Kandy, Jaffna, Batticaloa, Trincomalee and Kalmunai, the sources said.
Homes, construction sites, religious institutions, schools, etc. have been identified as common mosquito breeding sites by entomologists, the sources added.
The ongoing National Mosquito Control Week will end on September 26, the sources added.
