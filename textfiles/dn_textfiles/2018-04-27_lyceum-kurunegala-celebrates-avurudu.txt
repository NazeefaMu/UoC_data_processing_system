Lyceum Kurunegala celebrates avurudu

It is the responsibility of every educational institution to impart our traditional customs, culture, morals and values to the future generation. Accordingly, the Lyceum Kurunegala organised Sinhala - Tamil New Year festival which was both educational and a fun filled event for the children.
