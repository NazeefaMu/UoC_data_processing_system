Around 750,000 cases pending in Courts

The number of cases pending in courts around the country is as high as 750,000, Justice Minister Thalatha Atukorale said yesterday.
The Minister said the delay in expediting cases may result in litigants losing faith in the country’s judicial system.
Minister Atukorale expressed these views at a ceremony to mark National Mediation Day at Temple Trees held under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena. Voicing her disappointment on such a large backlog of cases, the Minister said, “it is imperative that proper attention be paid to the matter.
“Just as much as we care about the legal profession, we need to take some action to prevent such a large number of cases pending in courts. We cannot be happy about getting cases postponed. People undergo numerous problems due to cases getting postponed.”
The Minister pointed out that Community Mediation Boards are doing a great service in preventing a delay in the law. The mediation service has grown into a large tree that shelters the society, she also said. “It is important that we make this mediation program popular among school children. Now when an event is organized by a school, it usually ends in a brawl. This is today’s situation. So making school children aware of mediation is a productive cause.” Minister Atukorale said.
Meanwhile, the Minister also said legal studies will be included to the school curriculum. Accordingly, the curriculum will be designed to expand from grade six to grade 11, she also said.
“I am looking forward to raise awareness on law in school children. I wish to include legal studies as a subject in the school curriculum. Accordingly, a basic knowledge in law will be provided to students in Grade Six and Seven. In Grade 9,10 and 11, the students will be taught Civil Law, Criminal Law and the Penal Code,” Minister Athukorale said.
The Minister also said that school children must be made aware of drug trafficking and the social issues that arise as a result of it.
“Students don’t have a clear idea about drug trafficking. Drugs have become a major societal issue at present. Children are not aware of this issue. The Penal Code states that such drug traffickers should be sentenced to death or be sentenced to life imprisonment. It is important that we educate our children about the Penal Code as well,” she said.
Minister Athukorale also read out the statement issued by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe for the National Mediation Day celebration.
“The mediators who are honoured by the President today are a group of volunteers who are committed to building a good and humane society,” the statement said.
