New evidence in SLA investigation:
Former chairman allegedly rerouted flight for personal benefit

Former SriLankan Airlines (SLA) Chairman Nishantha Wickramasinghe, who could not withstand a flight delay of one-and-a-half-hours in Singapore on January 24, 2014, had allegedly arranged for another SriLankan plane flying on a different route, to be diverted through Singapore for him to travel to Sri Lanka.
He had used a ruse, claiming that a State delegation was waiting in Singapore to return Sri Lanka in order to get the plane directed. This was disclosed before the Presidential Commission investigating the alleged frauds, including the misappropriation of state funds and properties connected to SriLankan Airlines, during evidence given by SLA Airlines Operations Manager Gopitha Indrajith Ranasinghe, recently.
Cross-examined by Additional Solicitor-General Neil Unambowe, witness Indrajith Ranasinghe said that to his knowledge, it was the first time in the history of the SLA that a chairman had changed the official route of a SriLankan Airlines plane for personal reasons.
Wickramasinghe had made Kuala Lumpur – Colombo flight no. 319 diverted through Singapore, to travel to Colombo. The flight had a compliment of 130 passengers on board, and four of them were flying business class.
He said the normal route of a SriLankan plane was only changed for the country's President, adding that the said incident was contrary to normal practice. He said the list of the names given in the so-called State delegation included only Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama and Nishantha Wickremsinghe's wife. He said Minister Dr. Amunugama had never complained about flight delays. There were no records showing that any plane had been directed at short notice for his benefit.
