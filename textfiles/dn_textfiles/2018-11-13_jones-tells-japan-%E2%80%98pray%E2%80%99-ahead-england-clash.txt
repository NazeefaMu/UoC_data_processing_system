Jones tells Japan to ‘pray’ ahead of England clash

Twickenham, Sunday: England coach Eddie Jones has advised Japan to go to the temple and pray as he promised to show no mercy when the team he coached at the 2015 World Cup come to Twickenham.
England will head into the November 17 clash buoyed, if ultimately frustrated by a hugely encouraging display in an agonising 16-15 loss to reigning world champions New Zealand at Twickenham on Saturday.
That result, allied to England’s 12-11 win over South Africa in their opening November international, has calmed the fevered debate over Jones’ future that erupted after a run of five straight defeats earlier this year.
Jones knows how much Japan would love to cause another shock on English soil having guided them to a stunning 34-32 win over South Africa in Brighton during the last World Cup -- a result now widely regarded as the biggest upset in rugby union history.
Japan captain Michael Leitch was quoted as saying recently “we’ve been bullied a lot by Eddie and would like to give it back by beating England as a sign of gratitude”.
Jones responded with a stark warning for his old side. AFP
