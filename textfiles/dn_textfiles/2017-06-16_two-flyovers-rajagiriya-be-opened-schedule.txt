Two flyovers at Rajagiriya to be opened before schedule

Steps will be taken to open the two flyovers at Rajagiriya before schedule by December, National Policy and Economic Affairs Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva said.
The deputy minister said this during an inspection tour of the two flyovers at Rajagiriya.
The deputy minister said earlier it was planned to build two flyovers in two parts. One bridge was due to be completed by December 2018. However, work on the two parts were progressing expeditiously. Both bridges will be completed by the year end.
He said a certain TV channel was carrying false and fabricated news saying work on the bridges were at snails pace and some parts of the bridges had been broken and removed. Work on the bridges were progressing speedily than expected, de Silva said.
