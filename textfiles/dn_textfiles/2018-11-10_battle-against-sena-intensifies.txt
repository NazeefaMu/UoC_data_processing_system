Battle against Sena intensifies

The Agriculture Ministry has already taken measures to control the spread of crop-destroying caterpillar known as ‘Sena’ (Fall Armyworm - Spodoptera frugiperda), reported from three districts including Ampara.
The spraying of pesticides was started in the three districts and the Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera has instructed officials to provide funds for the purpose without delay.
Farmers were made aware about the pest and warned to be vigilant on the caterpillars in their crops by the ministry.
The farmers were instructed to inform the Agrarian Officer of the area or the Ministry via 1920 or 081-2388316 if they suspect that their crops have the pest.
Female caterpillars lay eggs more often and spread fast.
The pest was noticed for the first time in Nigeria and it has spread now across the Asia. The pest was spotted in India three months ago.
The FAW is a highly invasive species due to its ability to spread and reproduce quickly. The female wormlays over 1,000 eggs during her lifespan. Its larvae damage the crop, and the adult moths move in the direction of the wind, reaching up to 100 km a day.
The moth has dark gray, mottled forewings with light and dark splotches, and a noticeable white spot near the extreme end of each. Newly hatched larvae are green and move in a looping motion.
The larvae are smooth-skinned and in light tan or green and they have three yellow-white hairlines down their backs. Full-grown larvae are about 1-1/2 inches (38 mm) long. The face of the mature larva is with a white inverted ‘Y’.
