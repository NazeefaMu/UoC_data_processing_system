World Environment Day:
Anantaya Resorts to minimize one-time plastic products

Coinciding with the World Environmental Day, Anantaya Resorts & Spas of LAUGFS Leisure launched a special initiative to minimize the use of one-time plastic products at its resorts in Chilaw and Passikudah.
As a signatory to the World Tourism Organization’s (UNWTO) Responsible Tourism Initiative, which has set Sustainable Development Goals for Responsible Tourism by 2030, LAUGFS Leisure operates with a strong commitment to promote sustainable tourism through its Anantaya chain of luxury resorts.
“As a responsible hospitality brand in Sri Lanka, we launched this initiative with the aim to reduce the use of one-time-use plastics, such as plastic straws, bottles and cups, in order to promote responsible waste management in our Resorts, while encouraging our guests to be conscious of their environmental footprint. We hope to take this initiative to the community and across the LAUGFS group in the future,” commented LAUGFS Leisure Director and Chief Executive Officer, Roshan R. Perera. “We are delighted to launch this project to minimize the usage of plastic, which will be another key initiative to support the LAUGFS group’s commitment to create zero-plastic zones. The Resort Managers are working closely with our resort staff, who will be championing this initiative to create further awareness. This will also be a key focus area in the training calendar for our colleagues,” commented LAUGFS Leisure Training Manager, Kasun de Silva.
