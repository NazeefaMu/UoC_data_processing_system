We should be equipped with modern technology to move forward: PM

“We should be equipped with modern technology if we are to move forward as an economically developed country,” Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
He said the world has made immense strides in new technology during the last 15 years, and we too should reach that status if we are to march towards progress.
He was speaking as chief guest at the 150th anniversary celebrations of the Kegalle St. Mary’s Maha Vidyalaya on its concluding day on March 5.
The Prime Minister said we would not have a future as a country unless we acquired modern technology. “In 1977, we introduced the free market economy and the garment industries. Today we cannot gain much progress by depending on the garment industry unless we more onto other industries,” he said. The Prime Minister said entire villages flocked together in the past and joined hands during the harvesting season. Today harvesting was done using machinery and some people earned money by lending machineries nicknamed ‘Bhoothayo’ to harvest paddy and thresh.
“Our motive should be to reach the status of producing motors and mobile phone spare parts. Certain people had mixed feelings about industrialization thinking technology would deprive large number of people of jobs by making intensive labour superfluous. This was a false notion. Technology would not displace people from jobs,” he said.
The Prime Minister appreciated the support extended to the development of the school by Chief Minister Herath and Minister Kabir Hashim. He said the government too would help the school build its proposed swimming pool.
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, State Enterprise Development Minister Kabir Hashim, and Industries State Minister Champika Premadasa were present.
