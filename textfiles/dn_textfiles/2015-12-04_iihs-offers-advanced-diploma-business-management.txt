IIHS offers advanced diploma in Business Management

The International Institute of Health Sciences (IIHS) breaks new ground and introduces the 'Advanced Diploma in Business Management' in January, 2016.
The new enrollment for this three year advanced diploma programme is for students who have obtained at least three minimal passes for G.C.E. Advanced Level examination.
The advanced diploma programme will enable students to be eligible to pursue a Bachelors' degree in Business Management in a variety of foreign universities.
The significance of this advanced diploma programme is that apart from giving theoretical knowledge, students will be sent to reputed institutions in the country for internships once the first year has been completed.
This will ensure that the students complete a three year advanced diploma programme along with two years of work experience in the field. IIHS focuses on building student personality and skills in Public relations, while following the programme, which in return will guarantee working opportunities for the students.
This is what sets apart IIHS from other institutions, which provide only theoretical knowledge at a diploma or at a degree level.
The Advanced Diploma in Business Management delivered at IIHS qualifies students to study further by creating pathways in which students may study 2 years in Sri Lanka and complete 2 years in selected universities abroad such as in Australia and United Kingdom.
This Advanced Diploma in Business Management programme by IIHS can be followed by those who are currently employed in the field and have five years of working experience as lectures are held during the weekends.
Students who have five minimal passes including English and mathematics at G.C.E. Ordinary Level examination, can also apply for this programme even if they have not completed or got through the Advanced Level.
This is possible after following eight months of study in the 'International Foundation in Business Management' at IIHS.
The payment for the advanced diploma programme is provided in convenient packages by IIHS, as they are the only institution which provides this program in the Gampaha District.
