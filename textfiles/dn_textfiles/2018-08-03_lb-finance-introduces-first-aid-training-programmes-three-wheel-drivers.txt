LB Finance introduces First Aid training programmes for three wheel drivers

Aiming to fulfill a specific need of the community through the Company’s CSR agenda, LB Finance has introduced a ‘First Aid training programme’ to three wheel drivers with the support
of well-establish Training partner , BeSmart Solutions ( pvt) Ltd. The training programme which aims to fill the knowledge gap in three wheel drivers consists of theoretical and practical
training sessions on a range of first aid techniques including performing Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and safe transportation of casualties.
The pilot programme of the entire project is scheduled to take place in Matara in partnership with the Three Wheel Drivers’
Association and the motor traffic division of Superintendent police office, Matara with the participation of 100 three wheel drivers. Upon completion of the pilot project, LB Finance plans to implement a series of similar training sessions across the nation. Statistics compiled by Sri Lanka Police indicate that in year 2016 the total number of accidental road deaths reached an alarming total of 3,003. General observations indicate that three wheel drivers are quick to act on such occasions to provide aid and transportation services.
Once LB Finance became aware of this situation, the Company took the initiative to launch a training programme of this nature in a bid to minimize road accident casualties.
When requested to comment on the training programme, Sumith Adhihetty, Managing Director of LB Finance said, “it is a known fact that generally three wheel drivers often come
to the rescue of unfortunate victims of road accidents. However, lack of knowledge and training puts these victims at the risk of losing their lives or suffering serious complications during
transportation to the hospital or prior to that due to improper administration of first aid.”
“Introduction of this training programme is our way of filling this vacuum through training three wheel drivers. The pilot project in Matara will enable us to identify the practical requirements and redesign the programme. Once we are ready to launch the programme island-wide, we plan to train approximately 1000 three wheel drivers during the first phase itself.”
The pilot training session will include four separate training sessions during which 25 selected three wheel drivers will train under a professional First Aid Trainer. The First Aid Trainer will cover both theoretical and the practical part of First Aid training using modern techniques and tools.
Once the training programme concludes, the participants each will receive a portable first aid kit as well as a sticker confirming that he or she has undergone professional training in
administration of first aid.
“This is a worthy cause that we are pleased to introduce for the benefit of all Sri Lankans. I am confident that with proper training, three wheel drivers will be able to effectively help victims of road accidents,” said Suresh Nalaka, OIC - Motor Traffic Division of Superintendent Police office, Matara . LB Finance has continued to remain a pioneer in aligning the needs and interests of Sri Lanka with the many CSR initiatives carried out over the years. As a responsible corporate citizen,
LB Finance has etched CSR as one of the top priorities amongst the various business activities it engages in. The commitment to uplift the well-being of citizens of the nation with initiatives as
such is a strong depiction of LB Finance pledge to factor social responsibility and sustainability into their business.
