The Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport Sri Lanka, popularly known as CILT Sri Lanka, organized the much awaited, first ever, National Logistics and Transport Awards ceremony in Sri Lanka.
The most colourful event in the Logistics and Transport sector ever in Sri Lanka was recently concluded at the Kingsbury with the participation of top level government representatives, industry players, policy makers, professionals and academia.
Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, who graced the occasion as the Chief Guest said, “Every rupee you save on logistics and transport make you that much more competitive. We are depending on you to play that important role of making Sri Lanka a high middle-income country.”
“Without internal connectivity, the ports and the airports would not bring to us the final benefits. Logistics matters very much. It was the life blood of the ancient times. It is the lifeblood today. You all are playing an important role. You are helping us to create that employment, and its professionalism. It shows your dedication and the fact that your institute has been from the beginning being committed to build up the professionalism in the industry as the way of expansion. Because of you we will have a higher level of professionalism in the logistics and transport industry,” Prime Minister, Wickremesinghe added.
The Minister of Transport and Aviation, Nimal Siripala de Silva, in his address, pointed out that an award ceremony of this nature will bring much strength to Sri Lankan professionals and motivate them. He further stated, “You all are very much superior to many people in the world in this trade. [Whilst] advocating the free market economy, we are there to ensure that the Sri Lankans and the people of the soil are protected, benefited, and enriched.”
Mohan Pandithage, who has served the Logistics and Transport industry for five decades, was awarded with most prestigious CILT Sri Lanka Pinnacle Life-time Award by the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka.
The Platinum Award from the Corporate Category was claimed by the South Asia Gateway Terminals (SAGT) having given a close battle with the Gold Award winner Hayleys Advantis.
The Silver Award was secured by Unilever Sri Lanka. Recognizing the contribution by government institutes, Sri Lanka Transport Board won a Bronze Award. The three Merit Awards were awarded to CL Synergy, GAC Group, and the Colombo International Nautical and Engineering College (CINEC Campus). Dr. Edirisinghe quoting Billie Jean King, stating that “A champion is afraid of losing. Everyone else is afraid of winning.
We had many champions who were unable to claim the Platinum. Excitement is the beauty of an impartial judgement based on claims made in the application forms of nominees.”According to the panel of judges, the key area that needs improvement is the clarity and visibility of documentation of the applicants. Some applications were either rejected or received lower marks for the presentation due to this issue.
