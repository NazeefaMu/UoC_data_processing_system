Rita Hayworth

Rita Hayworth was a screen queen in the 1940s and a pinup idol for the troops during World War II.
She was married twice before (including to Orson Welles) and left Hollywood behind to marry Italian-born Prince Ali Salman Aga Khan.
He was known as Aly Khan and was the son of Sultan Mahommed Shah, Aga Khan III and leader of the Nizari Ismaili sect of Shia Islam.
The two wed near Cannes, France, on May 27, 1949. While she had little interest in the royal family's involvement in horse racing, she did win several races in France with a filly named Double Rose.
Things began to unravel in 1951, or so the story goes, when Khan was seen dancing with actress Joan Fontaine at the nightclub where he and Hayworth met.
She filed for a Nevada divorce that September, citing 'extreme cruelty, entirely mental in nature', and a custody battle for their daughter, Yasmin Aga Khan, ensued
Religion was the focus: Hayworth wanted to raise the child Christian and the prince offered her $1 million if she would rear Yasmin as a Muslim and allow him extended visits in Europe.
Hayworth rejected the offer, explaining that she respected all faiths but wished for her daughter to be 'raised as a normal, healthy American girl in the Christian faith'.
Hayworth was finally granted a divorce in January 1953. She died in 1987 at 68 of complications from Alzheimer's.
