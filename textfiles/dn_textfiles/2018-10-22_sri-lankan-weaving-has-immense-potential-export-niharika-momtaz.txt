Sri Lankan weaving has immense potential  for export - Niharika Momtaz

I have started designing sarees and I have found that Sri Lankan weaving is very neat and has immense potential for export. I will be meeting some of the weavers soon, said Niharika Momtaz, Fashion and Jewellery Designer.
“I have done Trunk Shows and participated in fashion shows in Bangladesh, UK, France, Singapore, Doha and Dubai, showcasing my latest jewellery collections. My last show was in Colombo at Massira Inclusive - Asian European Charity Fashion Show. We are planning to do something big in Sri Lank soon,” she said.
From an old age concept of “Brick & Mortar,” now it has moved to “Click and Mortar” model. For a good product with a good design, it could be marketed globally through online business model. There is a good demand for sarees and jewellery in Asia, the Middle East and North America. This demand could be increased manifold if we could offer good products at a competitive price. We have started hand-loom projects in Bangladesh recently and we wish to expand it to Sri Lanka too, she said.
“Sri Lanka and Bangladesh has had close ties for centuries, while they share similar tastes in fashion and culture. When two countries join together for a purpose, they achieve more and are more successful than if they worked separately. As such, I wish to bring out the best of both the countries in terms of design and quality, while creating a larger market where everyone could be benefitted,” she said.
“I always have a keen designing skill and now I have created a line of silver and other metal – jewellery. We make exclusive jewellery by using brass, copper, mix silver, pure silver and gold. We do a lot of bridal jewellery in gold and my next target is to promote silver and semi-precious jewellery in bridal ware,” she added.
Niharika has showcased her new collection called “Colours of Life” in Tiffany’s Red Carpet Week - Cannes during the 71st Cannes Film Festival in May, representing Bangladesh at the International platform. Moreover, she was one of the Jury and the official Fashion consultant for “Miss Universal 2018” held in Turkey.
Hailing from an upscale neighbourhood of Chittagong, Bangladesh, Niharika stepped into the domain of clothing design at the very early age of 18. The stint was brief and after having veered into the world of corporate finance for a decade, she has once again resumed her passionate path by designing jewellery and fashion labels. Come year 2012 and her jewellery labels Outliner and 1972 Couture Jewellery were launched from such inspiration. Point to note that as a professional, she did her Chartered Accountancy Articleship with KPMG Bangladesh.
Under the creative direction of Niharika Momtaz, the company has positioned itself as a high-end luxury brand. The products appeal to a sophisticated and modern clientele that appreciates the unique statement pieces. The launch of the products is part of a well-planned and carefully executed strategy, always consistent with the brand’s strong philosophy to engage local craftsmen. As a result, Niharika’s jewellery line has developed signature lines embodying funk and radical femininity. Looking on, the company would continue its focus on creating design icons: pieces you can keep in your accessories collection forever. (DJ)
