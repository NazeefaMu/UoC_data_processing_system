Kapurala seeks Int’l intervention

A former kapurala of the Ruhunu Kataragama Maha Devalaya has sought the intervention of the United Nations High Commissioner, the British Prime Minister, and the International Commission of Justices in respect of the violation of his rights and severe injustices endured by him consequence of malicious conduct of certain individuals and the inability of the judicial system to grant him relief in respect of the hereditary rights for the post of kapurala at the devalaya.
Pathmasiri Ranjith Adhikaram, a kapurala (religious cleric) of Ruhunu Maha Kataragama Devalaya, has sent letters to United Nations High Commissioner Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, British Prime Minister Theresa May, and International Commission of Justices Prof. Robert Goldman urging their urgent intervention in this regard.
Adhikaram said he was Ruhunu Kataragama Maha Kapurala of the devalaya in terms of the ancient rituals and customs of the devalaya. He was inducted to the office of kapurala of the devalaya in or about 1960 to perform the duties.
He stated that, despite his induction to the office, commencing from on or about 1997, certain individuals have collectively colluded and deprived him of entering the devalaya and performing his duties.
He stated that his rights to perform his duties in the temple was recognised by the Courts in Sri Lanka as far back as 2005, but owing to the contrived and determined machinations of some individuals, he has been deprived of his hereditary rights and has been helpless with even the judicial processes in Sri Lanka rendered seemingly impotent to safeguard his rights.
On an earlier occasion, the Supreme Court vacated an interim order issued restraining the Basnayake Nilame of Kataragama Devalaya from appointing former kapurala Pathmasiri Adhikaram as the kapurala of the Ruhunu Kataragama Maha Devalaya.
The Supreme Court ordered the secretary of the Ruhunu Kataragama Maha Devalaya that necessary arrangements be made for Pathmasiri Adhikaram to function as a kapurala for one month each year in the devalaya.
A Contempt of Court application was filed thereafter in the Supreme Court against the Basnayake Nilame of the Ruhunu Kataragama Maha Devalaya for allegedly not complying with a Supreme Court order.
Adhikaram stated that his family has been holding the post of caretaker of the devalaya since 161 BC. He stated that king Dutugemunu before he launched his battle against king Elara made a vow to god Kataragama and having won the war, he built the devalaya and appointed his (Adhikaram's) great grand father as its caretaker to perform rituals. He claimed that his family held the post for over 2,300 years. The Supreme Court on April 4, 2004 declared that Pathmasiri Adhikaram of Boralesgamuwa had a right to function as a kapurala for one month each year in the Ruhunu Kataragama Maha Devalaya.
