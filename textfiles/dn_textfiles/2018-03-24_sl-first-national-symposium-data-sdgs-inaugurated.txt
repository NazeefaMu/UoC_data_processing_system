SL first National Symposium on data for the SDGs inaugurated

Sri Lanka’s First National Symposium on Data for the SDGs was inaugurated with the presence of the Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, Deputy Speaker and Parliament Select Committee Chairman for the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Thilanga Sumpathipala, and the UN Resident Coordinator Simrin Singh. The two-day symposium is a platform for enhancing the use of data towards evidence-based policy making and coordination of monitoring the progress on the SDGs in Sri Lanka.
Ten sessions will be conducted during the two days by 24 esteemed local and international resource persons. The sessions will discuss three main points: 1) Impact and Importance of Data; 2) Context and Challenges of SDG data in Sri Lanka, and 3) Strategy and Way Forward in using data for the SDGs. The discussions will focus on the need for mapping baseline data in Sri Lanka, against the 244 SDG indicators, to understand where Sri Lanka currently stands in the journey towards achieving the SDGs by 2030.
“We have been working for more than a year since November 2016 and we have managed to publish a Parliamentary Report on SDGs, as the first country in the world to do so, making an assessment of the SDGs and the impact it can have on the country. For any country to go forward in achieving the global goals, they need to have a plan to achieve those respective goals,” Thilanga Sumathipala stated.
