GMOA vows to present facts of SAITM to SC

The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) will present all facts of the SAITM issue and the contradictory conduct of the Health Minister to the Supreme Court. President Maithripala Sirisena will intervene to solve the issue, GMOA Secretary Dr. Navin de Zoysa said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo 7 yesterday, he said police investigations will reveal the details about the shooting incident in connection with SAITM CEO.
The Sri Lanka Medical Council recognised the medical faculty at the Kothalawala Defence Academy. There is no argument about it, Dr. Zoysa said.
The GMOA invited all for a common platform to fight against the SAITM, he said.
GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said the GMOA will reveal hidden facts of the SAITM to the country.
"There is not much difference between the former Higher Education Minister and the present one, but there is a big difference between the former Health Minister and the current one. No gazette notification was issued empowering the SAITM," he said.
