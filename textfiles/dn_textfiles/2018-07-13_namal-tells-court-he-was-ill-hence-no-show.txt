Money laundering case
Namal tells court he was ill, hence no show

Filing a motion before Colombo Chief Magistrate’s court, Hambantota district MP Namal Rajapaksa yesterday informed that he was unable to appear before the FCID on June 24 as per a bail condition into a magisterial inquiry, since he was suffering from an illness. The FCID had filed a B report in Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court (No.3) against five suspects, including Hambantota district MP Namal Rajapaksa for their alleged involvement in money laundering amounting to Rs.15 million in a company owned by Namal Rajapaksa. Counsel Sampath Mendis appearing on behalf of MP Namal Rajapaksa through a motion informed that his client had to appear before FCID on June 24 as per a bail condition imposed by court, but he could not do so since he was suffering from an illness. He said FCID has been informed in this regard with relevant medical certificates.
The Additional Magistrate decided to ignore the suspect’s failure to appear before FCID since he tendered the relevant documents to support his absence. Further magisterial inquiry into the incident was fixed for October 25. The FCID had commenced investigation into a complaint that MP Namal Rajapaksa had purchased Hello Corp.Pvt. Ltd for Rs.100 million using ill-gotten funds of Gowers Corporation and NR Consultation Pvt Ltd, allegedly owned by Namal Rajapaksa. Defence counsel Sampath Mendis, Didula Rajapaksa and Mahesh Rajapaksa appeared for the suspect.
