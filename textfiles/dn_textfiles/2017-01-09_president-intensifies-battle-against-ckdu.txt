President intensifies battle against CKDu

President Maithripala Sirisena is to meet all ambassadors to Sri Lanka to seek international facilitation for the battle against Chronic Kidney Disease of Uncertain Etilogy (CKDu), currently progressing full force ahead, the Presidential Task Force on Prevention of Chronic Kidney Disease said.
A special hospital for CKD, funded by the Chinese government is to be established in Polonnaruwa, Presidential Task Force on Prevention of CKDu project director Asela Iddawela also said.
Iddawela further said they are focused on coordinating researchers on the chronic kidney disease, early detection of patients and supplying clean drinking water.
“We have set stage a consortium for national and international teams researching on CKDu in Sri Lanka. Such coordination was nonexistent before. The researches have not yet identified what causes this chronic kidney disease,” Iddawela said.
The Presidential Task Force on Prevention of CKDu together with the Health Ministry and the Social Welfare Ministry hase supplied clean drinking water for 58,000 families in affected areas, distributing 11 water filters worth Rs. 208 million, Iddawela pointed out.
New Irrigation projects in Medirigiriya, Galgamuwa, Matale and some other areas, will produce clean drinking water for more than 100,000 families who are in affected areas, Iddawela further said.
Asked on the agro-chemical pesticides still circulating in the market suspected to be a cause for CKDu, Iddawela said President Sirisena has ordered the Agriculture Department to take strict legal action against selling such harmful pesticides.
Director-General of Public Health ( DDGPH) Dr Sarath Amunugama said kidney donation is to be promoted since kidney transplant is the best treatment for the CKDu patients.
“A card has been issued for the interested kidney donators to give permission for them to donate their kidneys if they are to have a sudden death,” Dr. Amunugama said.
He further said that the cases identified as CKDu, have slightly risen in 2016.
“This rise may have been due to the method we followed to identify patients. We do not wait until the patients come to us. We reach the villages where CKDu has been reported and do regular check-ups. We have reached more than 300,000 villages to check on the spread of the disease.” Dr. Amunugama said.
Around 21,000 patients are identified to be suffering from CKDu. Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa districts record the highest number of CKDu patients, followed by Kurunegala, Vavunia and Matale.
