Oman opens premier free port facility for Lankan exporters

In a new breakthrough for Sri Lankan exports sector, one of the fastest growing free ports in the world, and one of the biggest free-ports in the powerful Gulf Cooperation Council has opened its doors to Sri Lanka.
This is with unparalleled incentives of entry hitherto not offered by other free ports in the world-and historic Ceylon Tea, and several other Lankan sectors, are the immediate beneficiaries in the proposed win-win play.
“Sri Lanka has multiple benefits beyond exports when starting at Sohar which can be Sri Lanka’s main manufacturing and re-exports base in the Middle East,” said acting Undersecretary of the Foreign Ministry for Diplomatic Affairs of Sultanate of Oman’s Dr. Mohammed bin Awad Al Hassan on April 6 in Colombo after meeting Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen at the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.
“Oman’s four famous free economic zones are Sohar, Al Mazunah, Salalah and Duqm. We like to discuss the possibility of a Ceylon Tea Hub in Sohar Free Port and Free Zone’s newest phase.
You can process, blend Ceylon Tea and re-export to the entire Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region, the Indian Sub-Continent and East Africa, almost duty free.
From Zohar, Ceylon Tea and other Lankan exports can reach 3.5 billion consumers in the Gulf region straight away. Sohar is Oman’s joint venture with the Port of Rotterdam and this is one of the fastest developing ports cum economic zones anywhere in the world. Sohar zone is more than 11,000 acres (4,500 hectares). Its first phase has been completed and almost all the space has been taken by 16 global companies. Vast amount of space is available for Sri Lankan exporters to set up with us in Phase II.
The GCC’s logistics market is estimated to be one of the fast growing sectors at a valuation exceeding US $70 billion, with Oman playing a lead role in it with Saudi Arabia and UAE.
