Govt to launch electricity demand-side management programmes to save around US $ 500 m

The Power and Renewable Energy Ministry is set to save revenue equal to construction cost of a 500 Megawatt power plant through an energy efficiency and demand-side management (DSM) programme, Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.
He said so after opening a new office for energy demand management in Colombo.
The office was opened with the Sri Lanka Sunithya Energy Authority.
Siyambalapitiya said the implementation of envisioned energy efficiency and DSM proponents are expected to cut down the mammoth expenditure going to fossil-fuel-powered electricity generation in the country.
The savings, the minister said, his ministry is going to make via DSM programmes is close to US $ 500 million when one considers the costs involved in setting up a 500 Megawatt coal based power plant, as pointed out by an official of the Ceylon Electricity Board.
Minister Siyambalapitiya said they are faced with a challenge to meet the increasing demand for electricity in 2017 because of adverse weather impacts hydroelectric reservoirs has had during last year.
He said three Cabinet papers are at the ready to be submitted to provide an uninterrupted electricity supply to the public.
“In fact we have prepared ourselves over the last two years to address the electricity demand of 2017, which will involve establishment of a Presidential Task Force,” he said. "We are going to divide our responsibilities. The Secretary to the President will supervise the energy management programme for successful implementation."
