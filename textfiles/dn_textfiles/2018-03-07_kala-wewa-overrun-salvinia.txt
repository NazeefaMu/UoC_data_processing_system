Kala Wewa overrun by salvinia

The Kala Wewa, which is a main water source of the North Central Province, fed by the Mahaweli, is now in a deplorable state, owing to overgrowth of salvinia, moss and other such aquatic plants. According to farmer organizations, over 5,000 hectares of the reservoir have been thus affected. Farmer organisation representatives also said that the Mahaweli Development Authority had stopped the removal of sediment from the reservoir.
The prevailing situation has affected not only farmers, but fishermen as well. They request relevant authorities to remove the aquatic plants and sediment deposits from the Kala Wewa.
