Kumbuk tree planting to protect water resources

The inauguration ceremony of the kumbuk tree planting programme organized by Thuru Mihira Sabaragamu Tree Planting Movement for the benefit of water catchment areas will be held at Godakawela in Ratnapura on August 25.
This is under the direction of Vocational Training and Skills Development Minister Karunaratne Paranvithana.
Addressing the media yesterday at the Government Information Department, Deputy Minister Paranavithana said through the tree planting movement it is planned to plant 100,000 kumbuk plants this year.
Under the first phase of the programme, kumbuk saplings will be planted along the river banks and basin of Kalu Ganga, he said.
“The Kumbuk tree planting programme will be implemented with the involvement of public officials, schoolchildren, Police, Armed Forces and civil society organizations. Plant nurseries are established to produce 100,000 kumbuk plants,” he said.
The Deputy Minister highlighted the importance of protecting water catchment areas which provide water resources to the island by growing more trees. These water resources supply the country's demand for drinking water.
He stressed the importance of introducing more public-oriented programmes to create public sensitivity and to enlist their cooperation for the protection of water resources from pollution.
