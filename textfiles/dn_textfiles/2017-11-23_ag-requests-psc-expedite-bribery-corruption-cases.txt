AG requests PSC to expedite bribery, corruption cases

Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya yesterday said that he has requested the Public Services Commission (PSC) to recruit 50 counsel as a part of expediting the administration of justice with regards to bribery and corruption cases.
Such recruitment will remedy the delay in doing justice to many of these cases as lack of staff was a main reason behind the hold up.
“Following the new recruitments, plans to expedite the process will be launched to study and file the delayed cases,”AG Jayasuriya said.
