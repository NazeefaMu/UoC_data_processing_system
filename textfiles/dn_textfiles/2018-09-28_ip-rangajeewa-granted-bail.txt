IP Rangajeewa granted bail

Police Narcotics Bureau IP Neomal Rangajeewa, arrested and remanded on suspicion for allegedly being involved in the killing of 27 prisoners during the prison riots which took place at the Welikada Prison in 2012, was released on bail by the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court.
On September 25, the Court of Appeal ordered to release the suspect on bail taking into consideration a revision application filed by IP Rangajeewa.
When the suspect was produced before Colombo Additional Magistrate Priyantha Liyanage, he was ordered to be released on two sureties of Rs.200,000.
The court also issued an order preventing the suspect from leaving the country.
However, former Prisons Department Commissioner Emil Ranjan Lamahewa, who is in remand custody over the same incident, will have to remain in remand custody until his revision application is considered.
