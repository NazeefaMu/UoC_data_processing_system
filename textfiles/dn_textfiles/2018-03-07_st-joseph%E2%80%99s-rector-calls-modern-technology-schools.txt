St Joseph’s Rector calls for modern technology in schools

“The government should invest more in modern technology for schools so that they could produce students required by the present world,” said Rev. Fr. Travis Gabriel, Rector of St Joseph's College, Colombo, at the 116th annual prize giving, held recently at the Rev. Fr. Stanley Abeysekera sports complex cum auditorium.
Rev. Fr. Gabriel said, “It has become essential to be conversant with modern technology in order for students to survive in the business world. Teachers who are used to the traditional methods of teaching have to be given proper training in the use of technology in imparting knowledge.” Jetwing Group Chairman and Managing Director Hiran Cooray, a distinguished old Josephian, was the chief guest. General Manager of Catholic schools, Rev Fr. Ivan Perera, Rector of St Peter's College, Rev. Fr. Trevor Martin and special guests, clergy, old boys, parents and students participated.
