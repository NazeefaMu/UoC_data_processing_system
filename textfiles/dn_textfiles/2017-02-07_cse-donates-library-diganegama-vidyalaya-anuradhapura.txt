CSE donates library to Diganegama Vidyalaya in Anuradhapura

The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) recently completed a library donation project at the Diganegama Vidyalaya in Anuradhapura.
The school was identified by the CSE as a potential beneficiary of its Corporate Social Responsibility project, and the exchange has since embarked on an initiative to donate a library facility for the benefit of the students.The library was provided with new furniture, literature and other resources to facilitate a comfortable learning environment for students.
Despite many challenges, the school has been remarkably successful in maintaining an 80% pass rate in the local G.C.E (Ordinary Level) Examination over the years. The school was also awarded as the best eco-friendly school in North Central Province in the year 2012.
Such success could be credited to the pricelesscontribution and dedication of the School's Principal and 12 teachers, who have been instrumental in inspiring students and families to commit to education despite the many challenges.
CSE CEO Rajeeva Bandaranaike said they are pleased to have been able to identify and address what was a shortage of a basic facility at the school. Through our projects connected to education, the CSE attempts to play our part with relation to providing access to education to communities that need it the most.”
