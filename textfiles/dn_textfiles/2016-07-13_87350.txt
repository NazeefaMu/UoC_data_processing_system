I probably won’t watch Olympic golf - McIlroy

 
IRELAND, TUESDAY: Rory McIlroy might not even bother watching the golf at the Olympic Games, saying in pointed remarks that he will only tune in for “the stuff that matters.”
Fears over the Zika virus have been cited by a number of top players, including McIlroy, who have pulled out of August's Games in Rio. But the Northern Irishman has also admitted that the Olympics just don't have the same meaning to golfers as other athletes.
He hammered home that point on Tuesday as he spoke at Royal Troon in Scotland, where this week's British Open will be held.
“I'll probably watch the Olympics, but I'm not sure golf will be one of the events I watch,” said the 27-year-old. When asked what he would turn his television on for during the Games, McIlroy added: “Probably the events like track and field, swimming, diving, the stuff that matters.”
Such comments can do little to help golf's prospects of remaining an Olympic sport in the long term after the damage already done with the spate of big-name withdrawals. AFP
