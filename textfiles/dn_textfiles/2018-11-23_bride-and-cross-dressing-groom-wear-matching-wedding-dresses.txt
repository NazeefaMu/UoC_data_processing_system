Bride and cross-dressing groom wear matching wedding dresses

Most brides would cringe at the idea of someone turning up on their wedding day in a white dress. But for Emma Sparre-Newman, 51, it made her big day extra special – particularly as it was the groom who was wearing it.
Her husband Ian Newman, 53, has been dressing almost exclusively in women’s clothing for the past two years so when it came to the wedding day, Emma knew that they would both wear a dress. But when they went shopping together, they happened to fall in love with the same 50s style strapless gown.
So at their wedding in Las Vegas on 21 September, they said their vows in matching dresses and heels.
Emma and Ian met at the Larmer Tree Festival in Tollard Royal in Dorset in 2014. Emma was co-managing one of the stages and Ian was performing with one of the acts – The Antipoet, an anarchic punk poetry/comedy act.
“Standing at around 6ft 8 in his high heeled patent fetish boots, top hat and with his long hair and kilt, he does rather make an impression; not to mention that he is accompanied by an equally flamboyant poet and a double bass; so it is fair to say that Ian had caught my eye,” Emma told Metro.co.uk.
“However, the first few years that I was running the stage, Ian wasn’t single and so ours was nothing more than a professional working relationship. I’m not sure that Ian even really noticed me but he claims that he assumed I was partnered up with my fellow stage manager.”
But in 2016, they discovered they were both single. They got talking between sets and hit it off. With Emma living and working as communications manager at My Aerial Home in London and Ian based in St Albans, they spent a month texting and emailing before they met up again a month later. And when Emma went to visit Ian in St Albans a few weeks later, she discovered another side to his life.
She explained, “Before I arrived he told me that when he was at home, he preferred to dress ‘more fabulously’. I had only ever seen him dressed in a kilt and an assortment of velvet and lace jackets so wasn’t sure how much more fabulous he was going to be able to get, but when I arrived at his house he was dressed as a woman. It was the first I knew of his interest in cross-dressing, so it was a bit of a surprise, but it didn’t stop me from giving him a hug and telling him that he certainly did look ‘fabulous’. He then said that he had an alter ego who was called Diane, so I shook his hand and said “Hallo, Diane, I’m delighted to meet you”.”
Although Emma was surprised, she realised that this was something that was an important aspect of Ian’s life.
After two years together, the couple started planning a trip to Vegas and they decided to get married while they were there.
Initially, they wanted to keep the big day secret and just get married in a Las Vegas chapel but Ian wanted to tell his daughter from his previous marriage and Emma felt like she had to tell her family too.
Although they had gained a few guests, they still didn’t want an elaborate wedding. Emma thought she would just wear something she had in her wardrobe – but then Ian interjected.
Emma explained, “I was still desperately trying to downplay it all, when my friend Amanda asked “don’t you want a lovely frock?” Just as I was replying that I already had many lovely frocks, Ian piped up with, “I do”.
“That pretty much signified the turning point. Amanda set about organising taking me to some wedding dress shops and we were going to leave Ian to make his own arrangements.”
While Emma was trying on dresses at FairyGothmother, in Deptford, South East London, she asked the manager if she would object to a man trying on dresses.
Emma picked out the strapless tea-length dress but never expected Ian to choose the same thing when he visited the store a few weeks later.
“Ian and I have very different ideas about what constitutes a good outfit and so we had no expectations that we would wear the same dress,” she said.
“As Ian tried on various styles, it was Emma, the shop manager, who asked him if he had seen my dress. She then pointed out that we were the exact same dress size and asked him if he wanted to try it on. Ian asked me if I would mind if he did and it didn’t bother me at all. Even before Emma had done it up, Amanda and I both just said “that’s it, that’s the dress”.
He looked amazing.
“It never occurred to me to be precious about ‘my’ dress. It was ‘our’ wedding and I never once considered that I wouldn’t want to share the entire experience with Ian being just as important and involved in the whole thing.”
