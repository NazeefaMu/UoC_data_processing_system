Nine suspects in prison bus attack case remanded

Nine suspects who were arrested in connection with the attack on the prison bus at Ethanamadala, Kalutara, were remanded until May 9 by Kalutara Chief Magistrate B. Wijeratne.
A prison bus carrying six prison inmates, including underworld gang leader Aruna Udaya Shantha alias Samayan, was ambushed on February 27. The incident resulted in the death of five inmates and two prison officials.
The bus was heading for Kaduwela Magistrate court from Kalutara prisons.
The magistrate ordered the Police to produce main suspect Bunty at an
identification parade on May 9. The Chief Magistrate cancelled the identification parade on April 27 as the prison officials who were injured by the attack were not produced in courts.
