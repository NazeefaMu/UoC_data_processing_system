Alahapperuma's allegation baseless: Ajith P. Perera

Power and Renewable Energy Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera yesterday thumbed down Joint Opposition (JO) MP Dullas Alahapperuma's allegation that the new Smart-Meter production factory at Bandaragama, only a reopening.
The Deputy Minister said Alahapperuma, who has a good reputation as a politician, has now fallen prey to dirty politics.
Perera said that according to Alahapperuma, the foundation stone laying of this factory was done by the former Prime Minister, but contradictory to the allegation, it was Minister Siyambalapitiya, who laid the foundation stone on January 5, 2016.
The Deputy Minister said he was not sure as to how Alahapperuma got Minister Siyambalapitiya mixed up with the ex-PM.
Perera requested Alahapperuma not to make cheap statements about a Rs. 200 million worth project and the local engineers that provide service to this factory.
He said Alahapperuma should not be fooled by his disciples by feeding him wrong information.
“MP Alahapperuma is talking about the factory opened in 2007 as a one to produce electromagnetic meters currently used by the Electricity Board,” Perera said.
The recently opened Smart-Meter factory and the electromagnetic meter factory are in the same vicinity and owned by the same company, Lanka Electricity Company (Private) Limited (LECO), Perera said.
He said some Alahapperuma disciples must have provided him with photographs showing the inauguration of that factory opened in 2007 to back the allegation.
The Smart-Meter factory was recently opened by Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjit Siyambalapitiya as a step towards the vision ‘A National Smart Grid'.
The factory in Bandaragama is to produce smart-meters, which do not need a meter reader to check and write down the electricity bill. The meter can automatically calculate the units and update itself when the payment is done.
The Deputy Minister said the government is to replace all the electromagnetic meters amounting upto a 60 million with smart-meters by the next five years.
The high tech Smart-Meter factory will provide around 500 job opportunities as well, Perera said. It would be a pride to have a ‘Made in Sri Lanka’ smart-meter, he said.
LECO Chairman Lal Gunasekara said their company holds 70 percent shares of the Smart-Meter factory. He said the factory was opened by Minister Siyambalapitiya this January with a new building, new equipment, and new staff and that it was not a reopening.
