Sweet season

Avurudu is here. It is a great opportunity to get together with loved ones from near and far and have an unforgettable treat. With a hectic and busy life you may not have the time to prepare all those mouthwatering Avurudu goodies.
This is especially true in today’s environment when most women go out to work. Even housewives may not have the equipment, time and know how to make the more exotic varieties of sweetmeats.
Then the Lakpahana sweet corner is the answer.
It sells every Avurudu sweetmeat under the sun, from delectable Peni Walalu to delicious Kokis you could select from a variety of sweets that range from traditional sweetmeats such as Kavum, Aasmi, Athirasa, Mung Kavum, Kaludodol, Aluwa, Narang Kavum along with the various types of toffees, Jaggery, Milk, Coconut and Semolina.
The pumpkin preserve rolls with cashew nuts, the coloured alpals and jaggery alpals will add colour to the table. Even the humble veralu infused with dates and cashew nuts will add a tangy taste to the taste buds.
Bibikkan and love cake made to traditional recipes will give an old fashion touch to the sweetmeat table.
