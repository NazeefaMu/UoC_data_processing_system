This week Dr. Lasantha Ganewatta, MBBS (SL), MD(Colombo), FRCP(London), MRCP (UK), DGM (Geriatrics)(UK), MRCP-SCE (Geriatrics)(UK) speak about the nutrition of elderly. She functions as a Consultant Physician attached to the Ministry of Health Sri Lanka. Dr Ganewatta has obtained qualifications in Geriatric (Elderly Care) Medicine from Royal College of Physicians, London and obtained on-the-job training attached to Geriatric Medical Ward in Queens Hospital, London, UK.
Q- What type of nutrition is required for elders?
A - The process of ageing affects many aspects of well being in aged population. Nutrition in elderly is one of them. In spite of having nearly 12 percent of population who are more than 60 years of age in the country (this will be 30 percent by 2050), their nutritional requirements are poorly understood and inadequately addressed by both health professionals and their careers. Therefore, they are simply vulnerable to develop malnutrition and nutritional deficiencies. On the other hand, many elders are suffering from chronic diseases like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, stroke, and memory impairments etc, which require dietary modification as a mandatory requirement in the management. Hence, nutrition in old age is mostly individualized according to their health background. Not only that but also their cultural preferences, financial situation, availability of foods, level of activity and food habits should be kept in mind. Considering all aspects, finally they shall enjoy the diet which they consume.
Q- What type of food should they be provided?
A - They should be provided nearly 1/3 of starchy or carbohydrate rich food in the plate which needs to be composed of high fiber content like in legumes and whole grains. The hallmark of ageing is the gradual loss of muscle mass and strength. This is called sarcopenia. This phenomenon leads to many of the problems in elderly including frailty, recurrent falls, poor balance and postural instability etc. To maintain good muscle function, elderly people need protein rich foods like fish, meat, egg and pulses. Their protein requirement is nearly 50 to 60g per day in other words 0.8 to1g per kg body weight. Elderly do suffer from many micro nutrients deficiencies which need to maintain metabolism, immune boosting, memory functions and smooth-running body systems. The best way to recover them is to eat plenty of fruits and vegetables. They are good sources of dietary fibers as well.
Bone health is paramount important in old age as they lose bone mass with time and vulnerable to develop osteoporosis. Hence, calcium and vitamin D rich foods are highly recommended. Milk and other dairy products, small fish and fruits and vegetables are good sources of calcium and vitamin D. No one should forget sunlight is a natural way to enhance your vitamin D levels.
Vitamin B and C, beta carotene, iron, zinc, large chain omega 3 fatty acids are some of the highlighted nutrients in elderly in addition to the above discussed. Fish, fruits and vegetables, nuts and dairy products are rich in those elements.
Finally, good hydration is very important to maintain their well being. 1.5 to 2 litres of fluid per day is advised for healthy individuals. If you have some illnesses like heart problems or kidney impairment your daily fluid requirement will be decided by your physician. Adequate hydration reverses many health-related problems in elderly including infections, acute confusional status, drug side effects, body itching etc.
Q- What type of food and beverages they should avoid to protect themselves from various health complications?
A - As we discussed in the previous question, elderly suffer from chronic illnesses like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, kidney diseases etc. Or else they are more prone to develop one or more of them compared to younger counterpart. Therefore, they shall avoid sugar rich foods, high fat containing items and salt concentrated foods. 3g to 5g per day salt intake is healthy for them. Eating natural foods is always healthier than prepared foods those are high in sugars, salt and many unhealthy preservatives. Drinking water is the best fluid that we could offer them.
However, there is a cohort of elderly who are frail with very poor appetite and consume very little amount of foods. They need calories, protein, fat and other nutrients condensed meal which meets their requirement even with 2 or 3 mouthfuls. And also they need less restriction. We should make sure to provide their preferences with different tastes and different consistencies.
Q- Do elders need additional vitamins, minerals, supplements etc in addition to their daily food intake?
A - Many of the family members who look after their old relatives request to prescribe nutritional supplements irrespective of their eating habits.
This mostly depends on the nutritional assessment of your elderly patient. If you find their consumption is inadequate to meet the requirement, you may prescribe some supplement provided they follow your advice for a reasonable period.
However, natural foods provide many benefits compared supplements. It contains number of nutrients in a single unit, is rich in fibers and are easy to absorb from gut compared to supplements. Therefore, nutritional supplements should not replace the healthy meal in elderly and better to consult your physician before you consume them.
Q- How important is nutritional assessment in elderly?
A - When we practice Geriatric medicine or elderly care medicine we use different nutrition assessment tools in order to recognize current nutritional status of the individual as well as to assess their response to the nutritional intervention. In young people this assessment is not complicated as their height, weight and body mass index give a better idea of their nutritional situation. When it comes to old age, in addition to those parameters we should consider multi factorial aspects of their nutrition. Your assessment needs to address many of them. They suffer from many chronic illnesses, considerable number of them have element of depression they consume lot of drugs and with ageing they lose taste and smell sensation ultimately leading to poor appetite. They could not chew properly due to poor dentition. Food swallowing is also affected in some of them. As you know dementia and associated behavioral problems are frequent health related issues in old age where they cannot remember to eat meals and do not have hunger sensation. Not only that, aged gut is malfunctioning leading to poor digestion and absorption of foods. Most elderly have constipation which is an independent risk factor for poor appetite. You should not forget physical disabilities which can compromise from buying foods ready to swallow.
Food intake and final nutritional status in older individuals are multifaceted and need multi-disciplinary approach.
Q- How should elders balance their food intake and exercises? How much sleep do they need?
A - As we discussed in previous questions they need to have a healthy and balanced diet with some considerations to special requirements. Their meals need to have enough carbohydrates nearly 1/3 of the plate. Those shall be good sources of energy with fibers like legumes and whole grains. And approximately 1/5 to 1/6 of meal would consist of fat containing foods. And same amount of milk and dairy products. Elderly should take adequate amount of protein rich foods like fish, meats, eggs and legumes. Recommended value is 0.8 to 1g per kg body weight. They need to eat fruits and vegetables at least 1/4 of the meal. With all these they need to drink around 1.5 to 2 liters of fluid to maintain better hydration.
Accumulating evidence shows physical exercises improve their chronic illnesses and cognitive function. Not only that strength and balance training exercises will reverse or slow the process of sarcopenia. Recommendation is to do at least 30 minutes a day for 5 days per week. Brisk walking, cycling and swimming are good for their health. However, they need to get advice from their physician before commencing.
Sleep hygiene is important to improve the blood pressure, blood sugar, heart function, memory and ultimately physical well-being. They are advised to have 6 to 8 hours of healthy and uninterrupted sleep per day.
All these advice and recommendations are invariably beneficial to lead healthy old age.
Q- A lot of elders consume various types of herbal plants/herbs stating that they are good for diabetes, hypertension etc. Is this good or bad?
A - It is a difficult question to answer. We do observe, some of our elderly patients prefer to have different herbs to improve their chronic illnesses. The medicine we use for their illnesses are studied in many aspects for many years in different populations prior to recommending for the prescription. Still they do have adverse effects and failures.
You may understand, if someone consumes an herb which is not well studied, no one could predict the benefit or the problem of it. On the other hand, adequate dosage and frequency of a medicine is fundamentally important to predict the treatment level. Some alterations in dosage are frequency needed in some illnesses like kidney and liver problems.
Those aspects are not addressed if you take herbal medicine on your own. Therefore, meet your physician and get correct advice which suits for your illness.
