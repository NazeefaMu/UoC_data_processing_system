Squad named for T20I series in Australia: Malinga returns from injury, Chandimal axed

Sri Lanka one-day specialist fast bowler Lasith Malinga will return to international cricket after a lay-off of ten months from injury when he was named in the 15-member Sri Lanka squad to play Australia in a series of three T20 Internationals later this month.
The national selectors have decided to include the former T20 captain for the short tour Down Under. The team was released to the media subject to Sports Minister’s ratification at a press conference held at SLC headquarters yesterday.
In the absence of permanent captain Angelo Mathews due to injury, Upul Tharanga has been named to lead Sri Lanka in the short series. Surprisingly Dinesh Chandimal who led Sri Lanka to a fabulous T20 series victory against South Africa has been dropped from the team to Australia. Chandimal failed to perform well in the ongoing ODI series against South Africa and was sidelined from the fourth ODI. His presence in today’s final match remains an uncertainty.
Malinga 33, was off the ground for nearly one year due a left knee injury and returned to training under SLC’s high performance manager Simon Willis. Malinga’s inclusion to the squad was considered after Willis’ recommendation on the fast bowler’s physical ability to perform his duties. Malinga last played for Sri Lanka in the 2016 T20 World Cup.
SLC president Thilanga Sumathipala commenting on Malinga’s return said he is very happy to have one of Sri Lanka’s greatest fast bowlers back in the team. He also said that SLC hopes to monitor Malinga carefully for the forthcoming ICC Champions Trophy in June and for the 2019 World Cup.
Malinga said that he hopes to perform well in the practice match in Canberra on February 15, as his performance will help the selectors and captain to make the decision of his inclusion or exclusion in the three-match T20 series against Australia. All-rounder Dasun Shanaka, Milinda Siriwardena, Chamara Kapugedara and opener Dilshan Munaweera were recalled to the team after a lapse of one year while Vikum Sanjaya is the only uncapped player in the squad. Dhananjaya de Silva, Thikshila de Silva, Nuwan Pradeep, Suranga Lakmal, Kusal Perera and Jeffrey Vandersay who was included in the South Africa T20 series have not been selected for the Australian series.
 
Sri Lanka squad to Australia: Upul Tharanga (captain), Niroshan Dickwella, Asela Gunaratne, Dilshan Munaweera, Kusal Mendis, Milinda Siriwardena, Sachith Pathirana, Chamara Kapugedara, Seekkuge Prasanna, Nuwan Kulasekara, Isuru Udana, Dasun Shanaka, Lakshan Sandaken, Lasith Malinga and Vikum Sanjaya
