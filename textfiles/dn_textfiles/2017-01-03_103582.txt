Sri Lanka not to nationalise seized boats of fishermen

In the run-up to the first ministerial meeting on fishermen scheduled in Colombo yesterday, Sri Lanka denied media reports that it proposed nationalisation of fishing boats belonging to Tamil Nadu fishermen. This clarification was provided by representatives of Sri Lanka on Saturday during a meeting of the Joint Working Group on Fisheries, according to a source.
However, on the issue of the release of boats and fishermen, there was no commitment from Sri Lanka, the source said.
India’s Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh and Shipping and Road Transport State Union Minister Pon Radhakrishnan attended yesterday’s meeting, another official said.
