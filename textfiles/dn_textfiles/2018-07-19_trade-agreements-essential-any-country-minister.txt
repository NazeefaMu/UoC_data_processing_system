Trade agreements essential to any  country - Minister

Trade agreements are essential to strengthen any country economically, Sustainable Development, Wildlife and Regional Development Minister Sarath Fonseka said.
The Minister said trade agreements are common between countries and are aimed at achieving economic stability. It can be observed that most countries enter into trade agreements with some other countries, which are economically sound to reach a higher level.
The Minister said so when he was asked to comment about the trade agreement between Sri Lanka and Singapore.
“I believe that trade agreements are a must to boost the economy of a country,” he added.
