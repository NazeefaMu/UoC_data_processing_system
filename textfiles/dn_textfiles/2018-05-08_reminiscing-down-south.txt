REMINISCING DOWN SOUTH

Many cricketers have emerged from the South who have done Sri Lanka cricket proud but today I am confining myself to two famous schools in the Galle district Mahinda and Richmond. The Richmond Mahinda match dates from about 1894 and has but two interruptions, been continued up to date. It was called the “Lovers Quarrel.” I am thankful to the Managing Editor and Publisher of the book “Hundred Years of Richmond-Mahinda Cricket.”G.M.Sumanathilaka De Silva for providing me the following information.
As far as the Mahindian’s were concerned there was Tall and lanky Athula Samarasekera a big hitting right hand opening batsman who played 39 ODI’S and 4 Tests for Sri Lanka, Athula captained Mahinda in 1981.In the not so recent past Athula was one of the pillars who emerged from Mahinda and this book gave a vivid description of the 76 th battle between Richmond and Mahinda where Athula Samarasekera captained Mahinda and Ruwan P. Korala captained Richmond
. Mahindians were the hot favourites in this encounter. Athula a centurion that season took fifty wickets and scored over 700 runs, he led the side from the front. Mihira Egodage who opened the batting for Richmond was a Sri Lanka schools cricket member who also had notched over 700 runs. Mahinda looked the stronger side on paper the Richmondites who were led by that stylish all-rounder Ruwan Korale one of the finest cricketers produced by Richmond in its cricketing history the book stated. Korale matched his counterpart and had scored over 700 runs whilst he took over 50 wickets that season as well.
Richmond started well, and after a good partnership by Nihal Fonseka and S.Nanayakkara Chandana Amarasinghe top scored with 66runs,however wickets fell at regular intervals and Richmond laboured for 80 overs and scored 203 runs.H. Munasinghe was the pick of the Mahinda bowlers with 4 wickets for 62
.Mahinda in their turn, were disappointing and struggled against dangerous speedster W. Udayasiri who proved to be more than a handful.One of his lethal deliveries struck Munasinghe smack on the head. He was quickly taken to the hospital with blood pouring from his forehead a scene one dreads to see in any form of a cricket match. He was later brought back to the ground with a plastered forehead and did not come out to bat. Mahinda managed to get only 141 for 8 with Munasinghe retiring. Athula Samarasekera stood out with a well compiled 56 runs and Saman Warnaweera(not Jayananda Warnaweera) chipped in with 27 runs.
When Richmond came out to bat in the second innings it was a surprise to see Munasinghe walking out with a plaster and credited with a hairline fracture and looking like an alien from outer space. Although Richmond started cautiously the rot set in with the top order caving in. Munasinghe in spite of the pain he was having due to his injury showed true grit by bagging 3 for 11.B Warnaweera also shone with the ball by taking 4 for 19 runs.
Mahinda left with the daunting task to score 136 runs for a memorable win, started positively despite losing two early wickets that of Egodage,Samarasekera ,and then Saman Warnaweera brought Mahinda within sight of victory.Mahindians at this point was “cock a hoop.”
How uncertain the game of cricket could be? Mahindians got into a tangle with run outs of Mihira and then two suicidal run outs of the Warnweera brothers, all hopes were buried in the sand, it was rather unfortunate for Mahinda run outs as the case may be being the bane of big matches.
Skipping backwards I had the good fortune of playing against Mahinda from 1963 to 1966 and ragging existed even in those by gone days. During my time I was fortunate to face the amiable Mahindians twice at the Galle Esplanade. It’s a common practice then to get the freshers subjected to ragging but I managed to escape ragging due to two factors one was when I applied black boot polish liberally along my inner flanks so that when it came to the inspection of inner flanks by the seniors (one was a late DIG) I was summarily sent away accusing me of not having a bath (thanks to the boot polish) for ages!!
The other factor was having fairer complexioned ones with good flanks, the fairer ones were subjected to horseplay.
Back on track I had great pleasure in playing against the dozen or so Amendra brothers, big hitting Palitha Wijeratne, the Wiley off spinner U.L.S De Silva who could spin the ball a country mile and had us in all sorts of trouble at the Galle Esplanade in 1964 where Nimal Edussuriya( no mug with the bat) and Prasanna de Silva who is better known as a crafty left arm swing bowler saved the match for us. I can remember vividly that all of us were on pins and plastered to our respective places and to cap it all our captain Duminda Siriwardene was so nervous that he was reading the “Readers Digest” up side down!! Later the nerves were soothed by the cup that cheers till the wee hours of the morning.
Richmond also had two fantastic cricketers namely R.B.Jayasuriya and Lasantha Kaggodachchi both represented Ceylon Schools in 1964 against the visiting Indians.
