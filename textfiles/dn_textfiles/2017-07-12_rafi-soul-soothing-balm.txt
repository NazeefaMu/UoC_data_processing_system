Rafi: soul with a soothing balm

Mohamed Rafi, the greatest male playback singer India has ever produced passed away on July 31, 1980, and his 37th death remembrance day falls this month. This year, too, thousands of his fans will pay homage at his grave situated near a lone coconut tree in the Mumbai Muslim cemetery.
He lives in the hearts and minds of millions of his fans throughout the world, and even today a melody of his is on the air, every minute in some corner of the earth. Artistic brilliance of the kind he possessed is extremely rare.
In the 1960s and 1970s, before the development of the local film and song industry, there were thousands of fans in Sri Lanka who enjoyed Hindi films and Hindi songs and Rafi’s songs were the most popular.
Rafi’s voice was like a soothing balm to the common man in particular, and he sang for all hearts and his contagious smile spread cheered all round. The thousands of songs he sang encompassed a tremendous range and helped him to reign supreme over others in the field.
Many producers, directors and actors in the Mumbai film industry owe their success to Rafi. His voice synced with every film hero at the time. On numerous occasions, he had provided financial support to film producers. “Rafi always gave without thinking of his returns,” reveals Laxmikant (of the famous LP Music Directors duo).
He was such a busy professional that he hardly found time to leave Mumbai. When he did, on his return he found a clamouring crowd of producers and directors at his doorstep, seeking his services says senior Music Director, Chitra Gupta.
There have been appeals to the Indian government to honour the singer posthumously with the Bharata Ratna, India’ highest civilian award.
