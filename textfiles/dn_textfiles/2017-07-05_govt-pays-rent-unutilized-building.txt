Govt pays rent for unutilized building

The Government accepted that it had leased out a building to house the Agriculture Ministry in 2016 while having paid an advance of Rs. 504 million.
This information was revealed in Parliament yesterday in an answer tabled by Agriculture State Minister Wasantha Aluvihare in response to a question raised by JVP Parliamentarian Nalinda Jayatissa during the round of questions for oral answers.
The answer revealed that the Government had estimated a monthly rent of Rs. 13.5 million with the actual rent priced at Rs. 21 million, including Rs. 6.1 million as monthly service charges.
The answer also revealed that the ministry was yet to be shifted to the building as it had not been prepared in a suitable manner.
