Schoolgirl commits suicide

Fathima Rizna, 10, a Grade 4 student of Balangoda Kirimetitenna Vidyalaya, had committed suicide by hanging herself from a beam of her house at Randolawatta Divisions Balangoda on November 13.
At the inquest held into the death by Balangoda city coroner A. G. Wimaladasa, the girl’s mother, Mallida Jeyamary, 33, said she had two daughters out of whom Fathima Rizna was the eldest. On the day of the incident, she had not attended school. When she had asked her daughter the reason for cutting school, she had not said anything.
Three months ago, she found a mobile phone inside her daughter’s schoolbag, which she returned to the class teacher by accompanying her daughter to school. Her daughter told the teacher that she did not rob it, but some prankster had put it into her schoolbag without her knowledge.
But the class teacher did not accept her daughters explanation. On subsequent days, when her daughter attended school, the teacher had asked why she robbed the phone and other girls had started teasing her by labelling her a phone robber.
Jeyamary said she earned a living by working as a tea picker. Her husband abandoned her three years ago. On November 13, she had visited a neighbour’s house to inquire whether there was plucking work available and when she returned home, she found that her daughter had committed suicide.
Balangoda Hospital medical superintendent Dr. B. N. C. Dassanayake who conducted the postmortem examination, reported that death was due to strangulation of the neck caused by hanging from a rope. The corner recorded a verdict of suicide committed due to mental agony.
