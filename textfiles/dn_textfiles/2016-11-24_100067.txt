The entry into the Indian fitness industry with the launch in Bangalore raises Power World Gym’s profile in the Indian sub-continent.
The founder of Power World, Talavou F. Alailima speaking during a media briefing at Taj Samudra Hotel said, “The Power World model has evolved over two decades and is well-tested. This has enabled us to create a network of 17 thriving gyms serving over 16,000 members in the country. We are delighted that our partnership with Talwalkars has resulted in expanding the Power World gym’s model into India. We believe that this has tremendous potential in targeting the under-served majority with affordable gym facilities. Bangalore is well-known for its large bank of young professionals looking for a healthy lifestyle. Hence, we chose Bangalore as our first launch city in India.”
