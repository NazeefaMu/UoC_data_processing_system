Sri Lanka has unique rehabilitation service system: Rajitha

Sri Lanka has a unique system to provide rehabilitation services. The last 2012 census revealed that 14.2 percent of the total population in Sri Lanka suffered from chronic disorders. Persons with either physical or mental disability accounted for 8.7 percent, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
He was addressing the World Health Organisation (WHO) meeting on ‘Rehabilitation 2030: A Call for Action’, in Geneva on February 6.
The minister stated that vision and walking disabilities topped the list. Some have multiple disabilities. The Health Ministry had teamed up with the Higher Education Ministry to train at various levels, including at graduate and post-graduate levels to address the lack of physiotherapists (now 530), occupational therapist (120), prosthetists and orthotists (39), and speech therapists (63). Proposed school for occupational therapists at Rheumatology and Rehabilitation Hospital would be useful in this regard.
According to the ministry, physical rehabilitation care is provided at four levels through five rehabilitation hospitals and 600 hospitals island-wide. The disabled is provided with facilities by the Health, Social Services and Skills Development, Public Administration, and Education Ministries. Mental rehabilitation is led by the National Institute of Mental Health in collaboration with 550 psychiatric in-patient units, outreach clinics, outpatient clinics and community mental health programmes.
Sri Lanka had enjoyed universal health coverage for over six decades and had good health indicators with life expectancy for males and females at 72 years and 80 years respectively. The island has been undergoing an epidemiological transition leading to a rise in acute and chronic non- communicable diseases, the minister had stated.
Annual tobacco related deaths number 24,000. Eighty percent of the packet of cigarettes was taken for pictorial warning under the instruction of the government. We are now moving towards plain packaging on tobacco products. Tobacco advertising will be restricted and ban on selling loose cigarettes is contemplated, the minister had stated. Fixing the maximum retail prices for 48 “mostly used” drugs, amidst much resistance from pharmaceutical lobby groups, was another initiative towards reducing the burden on tertiary preventative initiatives, reducing the price of some drugs by 65 percent, the minister had stated.
