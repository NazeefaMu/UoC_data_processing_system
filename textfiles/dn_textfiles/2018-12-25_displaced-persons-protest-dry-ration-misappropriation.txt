Displaced persons protest dry ration misappropriation

A group of around 50 displaced people in Rajawela staged a protest within the Naula Divisional Secretariat premises complaining that there had been a misappropriation of dry rations.
The protest was staged yesterday by those who were displaced due to the construction of the Moragahakanda reservoir.
The protesters said that the dry rations were distributed by the Naula Divisional Secretariat with funds allocated by the Disaster Management Centre. They said that however, the rations were not properly distributed. They added that a lion share of the dry rations was distributed among the friends of the officers. During the protest, the protesters were engaged in heated arguments with public officers.
Disaster Management Centre Matale District Assistant Director Chaminda Amaraweera said that the centre allocated money for villagers in Rajawela and that the recipients were selected by the Naula Divisional Secretariat.
Naula Divisional Secretary Athma Dilukshi Jayaratne, who had attended a meeting in Matale at the time of the incident, said via phone that compensation was granted to farmers in Rajawela and Moragolla, whose paddy cultivations had been destroyed in the drought.
She added that the recipients had to meet several requirements: one being that they had had to be farmers, second that their cultivations should have been hindered by the drought, and the other being that the recipients shouldn’t be government servants.
She said those who had met those requirements were the only ones granted compensation.
