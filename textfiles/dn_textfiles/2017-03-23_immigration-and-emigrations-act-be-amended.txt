Immigration and Emigrations Act to be amended

The Immigration and Emigrations Act No of 1948 is to be amended once again, taking into account global issues such as illegal migrations, human trafficking, terrorism and transnational crimes.
Cabinet on Tuesday granted approval for the Legal Draftsman to draft a new Act.
Since 1948, the Act has been amended in 1955, 1961, 1993, 2006 and 2015.
