Still confident and strong

Human Nature is such that if one believes in oneself and acquires confidence, life’s challenges and difficulties can be overcome. Though life is not easy, working with dedication, desire and discipline can help one breakthrough. The Daily News features Vajira Chitrasena on her 85th birthday.
Q: Your 85th birthday falls on this Wednesday. Have you enjoyed your life up to now and do you feel that all dreams have been realized?
A. As a dancer, teacher, choreographer and a mother life has not been easy. But, I persevered for the love of dance. I believe I was the first female Kandyan dancer to take to the modern stage very seriously, making it a professional career, in a man’s field at the time.
I have danced in all corners of the globe, not just anywhere but performed at the most prestigious theatres, to many distinguished audiences and heads of state. As a teacher, I have passed my knowledge and love to countless number of students. As a choreographer I have created a number of acclaimed ballets and dance recitals that followed in the footsteps of my Guru Chitrasena.
We always ensured that our work preserved the beauty of our island’s unique dance heritage, never compromising it for commercial gain. Above all however, as a mother, grandmother and great grandmother I couldn’t be more proud of all my children and how they have chosen to live.
In that sense, I have no regrets becoming an artist of the highest caliber and being a true cultural ambassador to my country, teaching and creating many generations of artists without holding back any part of my knowledge or experiences and I also balanced motherhood all in one life. But there is one wish that I still continue to dream of and that is to have a place of my own, to be able to live at the dance school premises and hear the drums once again and watch over the next generation of budding artists.
I have spent over 70 years of my life dedicating it to dance and to my country with no expectation in return. But, travelling now is becoming very hard for me. In fact, I told my grand children recently, I am not sure how long more I can do this. They are trying very hard to construct a ‘Guru Gedara’ at the Kalayathanaya premises, which I would like to see in my life time, but because of the lack of funds nothing has come up yet.
Q: At the age of 85 are you at peace believing you have made the right choices and faced life bravely?
A. Yes! I feel I have always made the right choices and I am grateful to Guru Chitrasena for recognizing the potential within me, challenging me and giving me the freedom to compose my own work. Although it was a challenge to maintain the standards that were already set by him, there were also many students in the Dance School who gave me the courage and inspiration to work. I never faltered; I kept learning through each experience but knew that Chitrasena was always there to guide me and point out any short comings. When I look back, I have achieved quite a bit, but when I was dabbling in it all, never realized what its outcome would be. I loved what I did and everything else followed.
Q: You have a wonderful family, are you content with watching them grow into adults with their own personalities?
A. They are all strong individuals in their own right working wholeheartedly to preserve and promote our culture here and around the world. I am content and my mind is at peace knowing that our legacy is safe in the hands of our children and grand children.
Q: Having devoted much of your life to dance and to the love of your life Master Chitrasena, are you now devoting time to spirituality? Because people at your age are considered to be in the golden days of their lives?
A. I started off on my spiritual journey in my early 40’s and have been a student of S.N Goenka who is a well known Guru. Since then I have followed 10 day meditation courses whenever possible. Meditation has helped me over come many challenging situations in life during the height of my career as well. As a follower of the teachings of Buddha, I have always applied his philosophies in my daily life. I truly believe this is the way the Buddha intended his followers to do.
Q: You have such wisdom, such knowledge, experiences and experiences. What kind of advice do you have to offer to a youngster who is trying to discover what to do with his or her life?
A. It is important to be truthful to oneself and to others in order to reach your goals in life. Pursue your passion wholeheartedly and work towards making your journey a valuable one for your country and the world.
Q: What are your pursuits these days? What do you do in your free time when you are not overseeing the Kalayathanaya?
A. Exercise has always been essential in my life and even to this day I have continued my daily exercises in the morning. I also help my daughter-in-law with small chores around the house. I enjoy stitching and reading during my quiet times at home. I still teach three days of the week at the Dance School.
But my happiness now lies in spending time with my great grandchildren. It’s nice to see the 4th generation of the family gradually assimilating with the Dance. I can only hope that they too continue to carry this forward.
Q: Is there anything you would like to say, that I have not asked you in this interview?
A. A cultured environment in my opinion is crucial for children to become creative and more importantly sensitive individuals. I feel it’s important for the younger generation to have more exposure to the arts and culture of this country as it is the one thing that gives each one of us a true identity that we can be proud of. And the beauty of our arts, is that it is for everyone.
