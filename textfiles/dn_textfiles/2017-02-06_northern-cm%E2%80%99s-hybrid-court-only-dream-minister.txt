Northern CM’s hybrid court only a dream: minister

Northern Province Chief Minister’s pledge to set up a hybrid court in the North will remain a dream forever, Skills Development and Vocational Training Miniser Mahinda Samarasinghe said.
Addressing the gathering at the 69th Independence Day celebrations in the Kalutara town on Saturday, the minister said certain individuals had become enslaved to foreign countries and organisations to gain certain privileges for themselves.
Samarasinghe said he had the privilege of leading the Sri Lanka delegation which went to the UNHRC in Geneva to counter allegations levelled against Sri Lanka.
“As a government we would never betray the war heroes or police personnel to the international world.”
Samarasinghe said he recently read a certain newspaper report that there were moves to set up a hybrid court in the Northern Province.
He said he would categorically say such a thing would never materialise and if any one has promised to do so, it would remain a dream.
