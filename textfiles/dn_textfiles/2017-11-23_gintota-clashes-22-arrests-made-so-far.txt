Gintota clashes: 22 arrests made so far

The Police have thus far arrested 22 persons in relation to the clashes which occurred in Gintota last week.
They have been remanded until November 30 and all bail applications have to be directed through a High Court,
Police Media Spokesperson SP Ruwan Gunasekara said.
The Police Media Spokesperson addressing the weekly Cabinet media briefing yesterday said that there were 127 incidents which had occurred in Gintota which were being separately investigated.
Answering questions with regard to a recent statement made by the IGP that the Police had failed in Gintota, SP Gunasekara said the IGP simply meant the Police hierarchy in the area, community Policing units and religious leaders in the area had not done enough to prevent the clashes from blowing up.
He also denied that there was any political involvement in the incidents and said it was led by a small group of extremists. “This happened on November 16th night, and then we arrested three people and produced them before courts.
On November 17, the situation was calm and we had religious leaders and community Police groups dealing with the situation but by the night of November 17,things had flared up again. It was after that,that we arrested 19 more suspects,” SP Gunasekara explained.
The Police Media Spokesperson added that the CID was investigating into persons who had published false or inflammatory reports on the incident and that they would be arrested for it.
