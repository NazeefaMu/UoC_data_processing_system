US Major General calls for cooperation in India Ocean region for peace, prosperity

The Indian Ocean region occupies a position of immense strategic importance, said Major General James S Hartsell, Mobilization Assistant to Commander, U.S. Pacific Command.
“Today, half the world’s container traffic, one-third of bulk cargo transport and nearly two-thirds of global maritime oil trade transits the waters of the Indian Ocean region.
The security implications attached to that level of commerce, therefore, are enormous,” he said.
Major General Hartsell was speaking at the recent Indian Ocean Conference 2017 in Colombo, organized by the India Foundation.
He said that sitting astride major sea lines of communication, the Indian Ocean region necessarily attracts geostrategic interest both from states within and without; two of the three largest economies in the world, China and Japan, along with many other nations have vested interest in resources and trade that transit these waters, a condition which has potential for competition and cooperation between states.
Economies throughout the Indo-Asia-Pacific continue to flourish because the collective respect for – and adherence to – international rules and standards, the Major General said.
“These principles, which include freedom of navigation for military and civilian ships and aircraft, the peaceful resolution of disputes and unimpeded lawful commerce, provide the foundation of the rules-based international order that has lifted more than a billion people out of poverty and benefitted so many nations for the last seven decades.” “Many countries in this region, including India, have demonstrated a commitment to longstanding, customary international law. Importantly, the example is being set here in the Indian Ocean by actions as well as words,” he said.
“In 2014, the Permanent Court of Arbitration resolved a long-standing maritime border dispute between India and Bangladesh. At issue was the maritime border on Bangladesh’s western border. In the Court’s decision, Bangladesh was awarded eighty percent of its claimed exclusive economic zone. India chose to abide by the ruling, despite being the much larger and more powerful claimant. India is using its role as a regional leader to increase regional security and stability and to lay the foundation for cooperation on other issues.”
Major General Hartsell said he wished to emphasize the value of cooperative, inclusive approaches to all affected nations in addressing some of the most pressing regional challenges.
“Joint patrols, inclusive military exercises and sustained engagement enhances our ability to work together to combat maritime piracy, protect trade and shipping routes, deter terrorists, and provide humanitarian assistance during natural disasters. The United States will continue to look for ways that we can cooperate in these areas.”
“That is a message that resonates to all of us tasked with providing the security upon which continued stability and expanding prosperity depend,” he said.
