Rangiri Dambulu temple issues to be resolved in weeks

The issues surrounding the Rangiri Dambulu Cave temple will be resolved in the next few weeks, Archaeological Director General Prof. P B Mandawala said.
He said discussions have taken place between monks of the temple, the Mahanayaka Theras and Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam as to how the temple should be operated as a world heritage site and a private monument. The disparities between the monks, the authorities, Archaeological Advisory Board, Central Cultural Fund and the minister have been resolved with the parties reaching consensus how they should go about operations of the temple.
“The agreements reached by the parties are verbal, but they will be put into writing soon,” Mandawala said.
Asked if the temple is closed for tourists, Prof Mandawala said, “the temple is not closed.”
Asked if the conservation of the temple is taken care of by the Archaeological Department, he said they were asked to leave the temple premises by the monks following the dissonance that escalated earlier between monks of the temple and the minister after the latter making a request with regard to temple’s income by ticket selling to tourists.
