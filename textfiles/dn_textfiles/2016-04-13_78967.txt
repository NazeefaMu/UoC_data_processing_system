Anandi leads Navy Women's hockey team

 
National hockey player Anandi Rajapkse will captain the star studded Navy Women's team having the largest complement of players this year.
The Navy Women's team have been unbeaten for many years and last year they won all the tournaments they participated namely the Senior Women's Hockey Nationals, the Seetha Devi Sevens and the Defence Service Inter-Services Championships.
Thus Anandi Rajapakse has a challenging task ahead of her to win all the trophies they won last year and also if there are any new tournaments.
Anandi Rajapakse is a product of that famous hockey playing school from Kandy Seetha Devi Balika Vidyalaya where she was introduced to the game by their longstanding coach M A M Ashroff. She said that she hails from the village of Yakkagahapitiya.
But it has no back ground and you have only the village meadows in which the children play and no organized sports activities, she said.
Then how did she come to represent the country in a sport which is popular only in Matale, Colombo and Kandy and now has taken root in Panadura, Kalutara, Badulla, Negombo and Wennappuwa. She said that one coach Ashroff met her and asked whether she would like to play hockey.
She had heard of this game but never in her life handled a hockey stick. She knew that her akkis (elder sisters) in school were making gaunt strides in this game winning championship after championship. She readily agreed.
That was in 2002 when she had just entered her teens. She was inducted into the under 13 team as left half and she has continued to play in that position. Next we achieved success by winning all island under 17 championship and also the National School Games in the under 19 championship in 2003 and 2004.
The euphoria of success made us set our goals much higher with centre forward Chathurika Wijesuriya spearheading us with her dynamic play. She was very lean but when she gets into action she is virtually unstoppable. Her last year in school was in 2006 and had helped her alma mater to secure many championship titles. She also represented the Kandy Schools and the Central Province Schools. She was also automatic choice to the Central Province women's team from 2006 to 2008.
She first played for Sri Lanka in 2009 and also played in hockey nationals. Earlier she represented the Sri Lanka Schools in many tournaments and made tours abroad. In the year 2012 she joined Sri Lanka Navy and helped them to win many championship titles.
An agile player always having her eye on the ball as the opponents forwards could pounce on the defence at any time with a long pass. Manning the middle line of defence is a tough job she said as it will expose the last line of defence and the custodian and make them vulnerable.
