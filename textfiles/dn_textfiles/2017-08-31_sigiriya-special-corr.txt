Sigiriya Special Corr.

Samurdhi recipients have fallen into dire economic straits since the Rs. 2500 sanitation assistance given to them in 2014 by the prevision regime for building toilets and repair of houses is being recovered from their monthly Samurdhi allowance.
Samurdhi Managers have received written instructions from Government Agents to recover this allowance from Samurdhi beneficiaries.
A group of Samurdhi beneficiaries assembled near the Dambulla Samurdhi Bank were seen blaming the government for the inconvenience caused to them by recovering the money from their Samurdhi allowance at a time they had received a severe beating from the prevailing drought.
They alleged that this Rs. 2500 is deducted from their allowance at one stroke after obtaining their approval to deduct it in monthly instalments of Rs. 500 each.
They also allege that the Rs. 2500 grant was made to them in 2014 by the previous regime by withholding their subsidy given by Divi-Neguma Development Banks for a period of three months.
