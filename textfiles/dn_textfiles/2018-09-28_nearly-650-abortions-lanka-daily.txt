Nearly 650 abortions in Lanka daily

Around 650 illegal abortions take place in Sri Lanka daily, Consultant Obstetricians and Gynaecologists attached to the Health Ministry said.
According to them, about Rs. 500 million needs to be spent annually to treat women who develop complications after undergoing illegal abortions under unhygienic conditions.
In addition, another Rs. 10 million is needed annually to educate them on using successful scientific family planning methods and to provide such facilities.
The experts were addressing a health seminar titled `Shed the darkness out of life through the light of family planning,’ in Colombo.
According to the Consultant Community Physician attached to the Family Health Bureau Dr. S.S.P. Godakandage, a majority of women who seek illegal abortions are married elderly women.
Most seek treatment for complications developed after undergoing abortions. About 100 complications can be developed as a result of illegal abortions. About 11 percent who develop mental illnesses seek treatment from hospitals.
Dr. Godakandage said educating people on successful family planning methods assist the government to save a large amount of money spent on avoidable health problems faced by women.
