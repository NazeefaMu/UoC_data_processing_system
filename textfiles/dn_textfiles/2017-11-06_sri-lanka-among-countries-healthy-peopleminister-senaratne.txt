Sri Lanka among countries with healthy people:Minister Senaratne

The Global Gender Gap Report 2017 says Sri Lanka stands among the 34 countries that enjoy the best health and survival rate, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
President Maithripala Sirisena provided leadership for Sri Lanka to gain such a place, the Minister said.
He was addressing the 25th Annual Scientific Sessions of the College of Medical Administrators of Sri Lanka, held in Colombo recently.
Minister Senaratne said that the medical administrators had worked hard including on public holidays to achieve victory.
“Private practice was banned for medical administrators and it has affected their income. Their issue should be resolved by the introduction of a special salary scale similar to that of the judiciary system,” the Minister said.
Certain issues cropped up in the field which were resolved. Providing a proper training for medical administrators commenced in the 1990s, he said.
Acting Director General of Health Services Dr. J.M.W. Jayasundara Bandara, National Hospital Deputy Director General Dr. Anil Jasinghe, College of Medical Administrators President Dr. Neelamani Hewageeganage and other officials were present.
