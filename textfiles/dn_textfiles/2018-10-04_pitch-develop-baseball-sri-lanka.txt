A pitch to develop Baseball in Sri Lanka

Sri Lanka Baseball is joining hands with Horizon Campus, Colombo, to improve the game of Baseball in our country. Although it is not as widely acclaimed as cricket, rugby and basketball,
Baseball is a sport that is rapidly gaining popularity. Currently Sri Lanka is ranked 40th out of the 120 registered countries worldwide and ranked No.7 in Asia. Our team has proved its proves by winning the West Asia Cup in 2017 and bagging a Bronze Medal at the Asia Baseball Cup held in Indonesia in 2015. The Sri Lanka Baseball Team took part in the 2018 Asia Games and performed reasonably well registering its first win in the Tournament. Furthermore, our Under 18 National Team is ranked 5th in Asia. This goes to show that Sri Lankan players have the potential to shine on the field.
A sport introduced to our country in 1985 by the American Embassy to two schools and two clubs, the very first game was played in the same year. Colombo, Kandy and Galle, the three main districts that have embraced the game, have formed what is popularly known as the Baseball Triangle. In addition, Baseball has caught on in Kurunegala, Polonnaruwa and Anuradhapura. Currently it is played in most of the Universities and has gained enough stature to be included in the University Games. The game of Baseball has been an amateur sport in Sri Lanka since the inception. The Sri Lanka Baseball/Softball Association (SLABSA) is driven by its energetic President Fazil Hussain and his hard working Committee who have succeeded in driving the game. Currently the Committee is striving to achieve an ambitious goal of broadening its reach island-wide, covering all 9 Provinces, 25 districts and 98 Educational zones by 2025.
Towards this target, they have employed 2 full time administrators and has brought on board the reputed educational institution Horizon Campus to take it to the grass roots level where they believe the hidden talent lies. Sri Lanka’s Baseball players come from all corners of the Island since the game is similar Elle, which is one of our national sports and Cricket, which is by far the most popular sport.
Speaking about their 2025 target, Fazil Hussain the President of Sri Lanka Baseball said, “We believe that Sri Lanka has the potential to be one of the super powers in the future.” He went on to say that the SLABSA is privileged to have the former Army Commander, General Daya Ratnayake, to head the Development Committee. “We are certain with his knowledge and energy. Baseball will be a sport to be reckoned with,” he added. The Baseball Association will be conducting their first development program in Jaffna and then moving on to Kilinochchi during the first week of October. To date Sri Lanka has 30 Clubs playing in the National league and 28 Schools taking part in the Schools Tournament.
The SLABSA is privileged to have 2 Japanese volunteer Coaches based in Sri Lanka along with Baseball grounds at Biyagama where tournaments will be conducted. Currently the Baseball Federation is working with the Sports Ministry to develop the Biyagama Stadium into a state-of-the-art venue complete with all necessary facilities and accommodation. Commenting on the involvement of Horizon Campus with Baseball, Nilantha Rathnayake, Group Marketing Director said, “We are proud to be a part of this project to develop Baseball in Sri Lanka. We are already making our mark in the region and I believe that this sport will benefit the youth across Sri Lanka.”
