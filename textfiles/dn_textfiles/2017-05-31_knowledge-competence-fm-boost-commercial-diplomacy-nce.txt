Knowledge, competence of FM to boost Commercial Diplomacy - NCE

The knowledge and competence of the new Minister of Foreign Affairs will boost the program to implement Commercial Diplomacy - states the NCE.
The National Chamber of Exporters of Sri Lanka (NCE) which is the private sector Chamber exclusively serving Sri Lankan exporters, whose member exporters make a substantial contribution to the economic development of Sri Lanka through exports, welcomes the strategy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to actively engage in ‘Commercial Diplomacy’ through the Sri Lankan Missions overseas, announced by Dr. Harsha De Silva, Deputy Minister at a recent Forum of the Chamber on the GSP + facility regained by Sri Lanka. President of the NCE Ramal Jasinghe is of the view that the knowledge and competence of Ravi Karunanayake, the new Minister of Foreign Affairs will be an asset to effectively implement the programme given the vital role he has played to boost the economy of Sri Lanka as the former Minister of Finance.
According to the Deputy Minister the Sri Lankan Missions in overseas markets, especially those in the markets of vital importance to Sri Lanka to develop and expand exports, which have hitherto focused their efforts mainly on activities other than international trade will henceforth be required to focus their efforts on Commercial Diplomacy by working closely with the relevant state institutions and private business houses in their markets to promote and develop the export of Sri Lankan products and services to achieve the economic development targets of Sri Lanka.
In this regard the performance of the relevant staff in Overseas Missions will be strictly monitored related to Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) set by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
