Dine with the fishes

The world's largest all-glass underwater restaurant is located in Hurawalhi, Maldives.
The restaurant was opened in late 2016 and it sits 5.8 meters (about 19 feet) below the surface.
This huge construction weighs 400 metric tonnes and is 90 square meters. To access the restaurant, diners walk across a pier towards the resort's over-water Aquarium Restaurant and head down a separate path to a long, winding staircase.
Each of 5.8's 10 tables offers views of the outside action. The coral landscape, which stretches around the edges of the tubular structure, draws all shapes and sizes of sea life right up to the glass, leaving you with the inescapable feeling that you're the one on display and the sea life are actually looking in at you. Courses include a mix of unique meat and seafood-based dishes that emphasize the flavours of the local and imported ingredients. All courses - sent down via a tiny elevator near the kitchen above -are paired with a selection of top wines, selected by the resort's sommelier. In addition to the seven-course dinner menu there's a four- or seven-course lunch.
