Karuna Amman released from case on AG’s advice

The Colombo Chief Magistrate ordered to release former Deputy Minister Vinayagamoorthy Muralidharan alias Karuna Amman from the case over his alleged involvement in misusing a Presidential Secretariat bulletproof armed vehicle worth Rs. 90 million.
Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara made this order taking into consideration the instructions given by the Attorney General to release the suspect from the case.
Filing a motion before the Chief Magistrate, the FCID informed Court that the Attorney General had given instructions to release the suspect from the case citing that he does not expect to proceed legal action against the suspect.
The FCID conducting investigations into an incident where former Deputy Minister Vinayagamoorthy Muralidharan alias Karuna Amman had allegedly misused a Presidential Secretariat bulletproof armed vehicle worth Rs.90 million, had earlier sought the Attorney General’s advice regarding future legal action against the former Deputy Minister. The FCID had earlier alleged that the suspect had purposely ignored his duty to hand this vehicle over to the Presidential Secretariat after losing his ministerial position in 2015.
The former Deputy Minister was arrested by the FCID in November last year over the allegation that he failed to return the vehicle to the Presidential Secretariat after losing his ministerial position in 2015. The FCID had further alleged that the former deputy minister failed to return this vehicle until August 2016, violating the provisions of the Public Property Act.
