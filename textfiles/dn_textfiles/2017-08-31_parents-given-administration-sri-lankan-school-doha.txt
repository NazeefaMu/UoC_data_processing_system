Parents given administration of Sri Lankan school in Doha

The administration of the Sri Lanka (Stafford) School in Doha Qatar will be handed over to a committee constituted from parents of the students which will also be asked to attend to the shortcomings at the institution.
All this work will be supervised through the Sri Lanka Embassy in Qatar.
The arrangement had received the approval of the Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry, said Sri Lanka Ambassador in Qatar A.S.P. Liyanage.
This followed a special discussion held with Foreign Affairs State Minister Vasantha Senanayake at the ministry to iron out the administrative and formal problems which had cropped up at the Sri Lanka school in Doha Qatar on August 29. Liyanage said he pointed out at this discussion that the Sri Lanka school had been functioning for the last 16 years maintained by a group of Sri Lankans there who had not reported anything about the school to the Sri Lankan Embassy, although Sri Lankan schools maintained in foreign countries should come under the purview of the relevant Sri Lankan Embassy.
A group of concerned parents had complained that no infrastructure development had taken place at the school for the past 16 years although a sum of nearly 9 million Qatar Riyals (Rs. 400 million) had accrued to the school fund.
