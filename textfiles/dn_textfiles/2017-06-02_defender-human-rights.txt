Defender of human rights

Appathuray Vinayagamoorthy:
Appathuray Vinayagamoorthy, former Member of Parliament for Jaffna District, an attorney-at-law by profession, was born on December 19, 1933 at Sarasalai, an underdeveloped suburb of the Chavakachcheri Electorate. He passed away on May 28.
Vinayagamoorthy received his primary education at Sarasalai Vidhiyalayam. From there, he bourgeoned to Driberg College, Chavakachcheri where he completed his secondary education. He became a teacher for sometime at Hindu College, Sangathanai, Chavakachcheri.
Attainments
In around1953, he entered the Government Clerical Service under the Ministry of Justice and discharged his duties as an interpreter in several Courts in many parts of the island. During the period of his service under the Ministry of Justice, he obtained the LLB degree and enrolled as an attorney-at-law on October 18, 1985.
He commenced his legal practice under G. G. Ponnambalam (Jnr). He worked so assiduously that no force could stop his forward march with a significant leap into the field of human rights cases.
He would rush to the forefront to defend those who were incarcerated and languishing in detention or prison without recourse to legal remedy, incarcerated under the provisions of Emergency Regulations and/or the Prevention of Terrorism Act. He is a human rights activist. He has appeared in many hundreds of cases, defending human rights, and continued to do so even in the evening of his life.
He brought luster to the legal profession. He won the hearts of others by a touch of love and fully understanding the sufferings of others and not by the claws of terror or deceit.
Vinayagamoorthy was blessed with dynamic, unwavering and deep commitment to defend the underdogs. The case of Vinayagamoorthy vs The Army Commander and Others reported in (1997) 1 Sri. L. R. Page 113 would illustrate his burning desire to defend human rights.
One Vijayam Wimalenthiran was taken into custody by Army Officers on the October 2, 1993 at a lodge in Colombo. It was alleged that immediately upon his arrest, he was blindfolded. It was also alleged that he was detained blindfolded and interrogation too was carried out while he was blindfolded.
The investigators fetched an idea without any kind of credible information that Wimalenthiran was a member of a suicide squad, ordered by the LTTE to assassinate late President Ranasinghe Premadasa. The Army Officers had secured under the provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, a purported confession from him to that effect. The authorities had failed to produce him in Court even after obtaining the alleged confession. He was so detained for more than four months without being produced in a Court.
Article 126 (2) of the Constitution empowers an attorney-at-law to make an application to the Supreme Court, appear and defend any person with regard to the allegation of violation of his fundamental rights by executive and/or administrative action. In this scenario, the human rights activist, Vinayagamoorthy filed on January 31, 1994 an application by way of Petition, verified by Affidavit with supporting Affidavits, alleging that the fundamental rights of the said Wimalenthiran under Articles 11, 13 (1), (2), 14 (1) (g) and (h) of the Constitution had been infringed by the Respondents, the Army Officers.
When Vinayagamoorthy supported the application, the Supreme Court referred the matter to the Human Rights Task Force (HRTF) for an inquiry and report. The Project Director of the HRTF reported inter-alia to the Supreme Court on March 24, 1994 as follows. “With regard to the arrest and detention of the petitioner the Army Intelligence Unit has been unable to give a plausible explanation. The petitioner has been in detention for 142 days without being produced to a Court of Law. We were therefore obliged to direct the Secretary, Ministry of Defence to revoke the Detention Order and release the DETAINEE, Vimalendran from custody”.
Vinayagamoorthy tirelessly pursued the application and the Supreme Court considered the report of the HRTF on March 29, 1994 and on that date the Respondents were represented by the State Counsel.
Thereupon, the Supreme Court made several directions to the HRTF and it was minuted to state that “State Counsel undertakes to revoke the detention order and to release the petitioner if no indictment is sent to an appropriate High Court on or before 15.05.94; and in any event if such indictment is sent State Counsel undertakes that the respondents will revoke the detention order and release the petitioner if he is acquitted or discharged or if a suspended sentence is imposed on him in the High Court. In view of that undertaking Counsel for the petitioner (Vinayagamoorthy) does not wish to pursue this application even in respect of Article 11”.
Noble Vinayagamoorthy
The above noble conduct of Vinagagamoorthy would certainly impel anyone to reminiscing over his lifestyle, thought, reflection and action. Though Vinayagamoorthy was so dedicated and efficient enough to make out a successful case for his client, he, as a man of ‘ahimmsa’, never manifested blood thirsty against his adversaries: never attempted to gloat over success by unfair means. His fragrance of service to the humanity would be remembered fondly forever even after his death. His death would not deter or eclipse his service rendered to humanity: glory to his humbleness.
The State failed to honour its undertaking. The State informed the Supreme Court that it was unable to carry out its undertaking as there were many suspects involved in the conspiracy to assassinate late President Ranasinghe Premadasa and they were at large and therefore, the investigation was not completed, rendering the Attorney General unable to forward the indictment against Vijayam Wimalenthiran.
Undeterred by these tedious and tiresome procedures, the relentless Vinayagamoorthy never failed to pursue his right to support the application for leave to proceed.
On July 28, 1994, the Supreme Court granted him to proceed with the application only in so far as it related to the alleged violation of Articles 13 (1) and (2) of the Constitution, to wit, Article 13 (1) states that “no person shall be arrested except according to procedure established by law. Any person arrested shall be informed of the reason for his arrest” and Article 13 (2) states that “every person held in custody, detained or deprived of personal liberty shall be brought before the judge of the nearest competent court according to procedure established by law, and shall not be further held in custody, detained or deprived of personal liberty except upon and in terms of the order of such judge made in accordance with procedure established by law”.
RKW Goonesekera
To argue the main case, Vinayagamoorthy retained R. K. W. Goonesekere, popularly known as RKW. He is the teacher of all teachers of law, descended from Peradeniya University to Law College as Principal, and later appeared in many human rights cases and contributed essays on human rights.
The Supreme Court declared that Vijayam Wimalenthiran’s fundamental rights under Article 13 (1) and Article 13 (2) of the Constitution were violated by the 1ST, 2ND and 3RD Respondents (Army Officers) and ordered the State to pay Wimalenthiran a sum of Rs. 25,000 as compensation and a sum of Rs. 5,000 as costs. The Supreme Court held inter-alia that ‘in order to prevent or minimize “disappearances or abuses”, it is of paramount importance that the requirements laid down by the regulations should be strictly observed. They were not intended for merely cosmetic purposes, but for the sake of fulfilling the basic obligation of the State to ensure the personal security and liberty of all persons’.
He was always noble and he harmed none but was good to all. I conclude by quoting Shakespeare from Julius Caesar, with apology of little change of words:
“His life is gentle, and the elements
So mix’d in him, that Nature will stand up
And say to all the world, THIS IS A MAN”.
C. V. Vivekananthan, Attorney-at-law
