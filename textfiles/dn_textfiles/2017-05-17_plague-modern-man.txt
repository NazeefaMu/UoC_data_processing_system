Plague of modern man

Today, man is living in the twenty first century and this human society is entirely different from the ancient world. Modern man is rapidly accomplishing the results of his scientific and technological progress. Although we are not entitled to say that archaic man is better than modern man, it is explicitly clear that modern man is facing a lot of socio-economic, political and environmental problems. Needless to say that the society in which we live today is highly complicated and bewildered with many tangles (jatas). The major differentiation from the ancient era is that modern man is facing the danger of extinction. Some scientists and certain political soothsayers are of the opinion that the whole world could be affected by a nuclear war. Some erudite Tibetan monks enlighten others that there would be a kind of war for major destruction.
Bahijata or man-made problems
Day by day, hundreds and hundreds of new troubles and social problems arise in our society. Poverty, malnutrition, population problem, environmental pollution, unemployment, drug-related crimes, shocking crimes that related to religious fanaticism, poverty-related crimes, terrorism, global warming, world-shattering nature of man are to name but a few. In short, the whole human society is in a state of confusion or bewilderment. This current socio-economic situation is clearly suggested by the Pali term ‘bahijata’ or outer tangle.
All are running after pleasures, money and corporeal happiness without understanding what they really are doing. Can this chaotic situation be impeded in a certain way? Who is there in the world, heavenly deity or someone else to give proper medication for these man-made problems? Specially, our young generation is running after mental pleasures by over-using of computers and cellular phones. What would be the results of this misuse of technological appliances for them? With this infatuated addiction, it seems that there is a considerable change of traditional values and collapse of accepted morality and moral duties.
When social morality collapses, everything would go to ruination. All the members of any given society would be seriously worried by such type of unethical behaviorism. Therefore, it is not incorrect to say, as opined by Prof. Gunapala Dharmasiri, that modern man is digging his own grave at a frantic rate.
Kamagavesi Society
According to Buddhism that modern society can be named as pleasure-seeking social order (Kamagavesi Samaja), and it is really money-centred and extremely competitive. As a result, there is no collaboration and cooperation among human beings at all. It seems that man tries to seek his own happiness through competition, but he never finds it in the circle of competition. Competition gives birth to despondency, misery, unhappiness, mental suffering and unsatisfactory results.
Negative phenomena and negative energies are the very foundation of competition. We need to understand properly the big difference of competition and co-operation. Therefore, we all are in urgent need of a considerable transformation of human attitudes. Human attitudes and thoughts play major role in our progress or disaster. So, pleasure-seeking attitudes (Kamagavesi sankappas) of this pleasure-seeking society (Kamagavesi Samaja) should be understood very carefully.
Albert Einstein
What is the respond for this pointless competition and growing discontent of mankind? Is there any socio-religious thought or scientific thinking which is capable of bringing peace and cooperation to this confused world? Albert Einstein, the greatest scientist (Physicist) of the twentieth century articulates thus:
“If there is any religion which is acceptable to modern scientific mind, it is Buddhism. It is capable of bringing peace, prosperity and happiness into profoundly disturbed world.”
The greatest scientist of the twentieth century appropriately shows us the proper way to happiness and prosperity, and also to world peace. He unquestionably points out that Buddhism has the scientific foundation to solve the unethical problems and dishonourable behaviour of mankind. Therefore, it is the utmost duty of man today to focus the maximum attention to the categorical word of Albert Einstein. If not, we all will have to unexpectedly face with thousands of new forms of mental and physical sufferings.
Mythical views (Ditthis)
Dogmatic mythical views (Ditthis) play a major role in many conflicts of the world today. Rigid views close open-mindedness and they show aggression to genuine ethical ideas of human beings. Some people those who are bounded by certain religious mythical views (Ditthis) are not ready to read or consider the religious and ethical texts belong to others. They never even give permission to their followers of thinking or hearing of such things which belong to other faiths. They consider that all other faiths are enemies to their religion and culture. This is, in a way to forget the man’s brotherhood and common feelings. Buddhism discards all these mythical views. The teachings of the Buddha paved the way for tearing the mythical curtain of dogmatic views of the 6th century B.C. in India.
Blind faith
Blind faith certainly conduces to seize wrong views and then the person would do whatever the terrible thing to satisfy his idea in the name of his grasped view. Mistaken wrong views are so dangerous for the person himself or herself and for others. Buddhism teaches us to be open-minded and to give up all pre-conceived ideas and prejudices in order to understand truth and reality. Buddhism is not a secret doctrine and it is open to all human beings alike. Buddhism does not demand blind faith (amulika saddha) from its followers and it instructs us to cultivate “saddha” (confidence) but not “bhakti” or mere faith.
According to Buddhist teachings, mere faith may lead us to partial blindness of knowledge. According to one classification, “Saddha” is explained in Buddhism as twofold: ‘amulika saddha’- (blind faith) and ‘akaravati saddha’ - (confidence grounded on knowledge and inquiry). We are advised to cultivate ‘akaravati saddha’ and whereas ‘amulika saddha’ is to be abandoned. Those who keep hold of blind faith are like unsighted people and they never see the truth or reality of man and universe.
Kamagavesi problems
What is the Buddhist attitude to the problems of modern Kamagavesi Society? Does it recommend any appropriate process of finding an answer to these continual hardships? Before going to give solutions to various problems of this modern industrial man, or better say, computer-encircled man, Buddhism advices us to scrutinize the real cause of all problems. It explicitly explains that all the family problems, socio-economic and political troubles arise as a consequence of man’s desire (lobha), hatred (dosa), and delusion (moha).
It is true that man abuses environmental resources and produces pernicious nuclear weapons. Why does he produce atomic bombs, laser bombs, and inter-continental missiles? What is the use of supersonic fighters? How many billions of money that they burn up for inventing such lethal weapons? What are they going to satisfy by producing such heinous weapons? These are really the results of man’s desire (lobha) and hatred (dosa). Therefore, it is correct to say that over the entire world, today spreads an invisible umbrella of computerized nuclear terror. This proves that man’s desires can never be satisfied with whatever he owns.
Snare of desire (Tanhajala)
Desire or tanha (or lobha) or the fever of unsatisfied longing is to be understood with awareness. We all are in the ocean of desire (Tanha-samudda). Really, it is a poisoned arrow (Tanha-salla). People are dancing according to the feelings of the strike of that poisoned arrow of desire (Tanha-salla). At that moment, they behave as devils who do not like ethical actions and nor they see the real nature of humanity since they are encircled by the snare of desire (tanha-jala). The extreme desires conduce to so many ills and, then corruptions overpower in our society. Tanha can kill the peaceful serenity and softness of man’s mind. We are asked to uproot desire, if we need to lead a happy life. From birth to death, we are running after sensual pleasures, wealth and so on. Finally we get exhausted and frustrated and, when we perceive our past running, then only we understand that we have run after our own desired-mind.
Political leaders chase political motivations and they are driven by their ‘isms’ or ideologies. They always think that, “this system only is the real politics; every other movement is in the wrong path”. Some religious leaders are of the opinion, “This only is the precise truth, everything else is false” (idhameva saccam moghamaññam) and engage in killing people belong to other faiths and destroy the religious monuments of other religions. Because of these perverted mental notions they are chasing after their own ideas like blind people. Finally they get nothing but mental and physical repercussions.
Oneness of mankind
Today, many are not intelligent enough to recognize the sacredness of humanity, and top priority is given to commercial motivations. Many are not capable of understanding the fact that why they hate their own species. This is because of blindness to reality and human ethics. In accordance with the summary of the Vasettha sutta and the Assalayana sutta of the Majjhima Nikaya, we may come to the following conclusion:
“There is one nation in the world, that is, human nation;
There is one caste in the world, that is, human caste.”
Although humans have certain wrong views and assumptions regarding race and caste distinctions, they have to accept the fact that, “All are equal before the moral law (Dhamma).” Wrong actions guided by wrong views never pacify our hearts, and the day would come to give us repercussions for our wrong actions. Wrong-doers can escape from the country-law but not from the chain of moral law. Carelessness of moral law means the deterioration and destruction of everything. It is obvious that crimes, social ills, and war-games are the effects of negligence of the principles of moral law, and again it is targeted at the destruction of man’s own species. It comes from unreality or without proper understanding of the Dhamma.
Mind culture
Mind is the fore-runner of our actions and thoughts. It can be tested by anybody in the world if they are commonsensical people. Our positive mental behavior or wholesome mental operation is the very foundation of our future happiness. Long-lasting happiness never comes only from our money or wealth. Today, there is a growing tendency towards to understand that money plays a secondary role in experiencing real happiness. Real happiness always comes from the positive mental energies. Positive mental energies are spontaneously generated by loving-kindness (metta), kindness (karuna), empathetic joy (mudita), equanimity (upekkha), gentleness (mudu), giving (dana), observing precepts (sila), meditation (bhavana), and such type of mental and physical proceedings.
To change this confused human society, cultivation of compassion (karuna) and loving-kindness (metta) are essentially needed today. Without the cultivation of compassion, the nature and sacredness of humanity can never be understood.
Supersonic fighters, fighter-bombers or inter-continental atomic missiles, nuclear weapons are not automatically functioned, and it is the man who operates them to destruct others. World political leaders play a major role in organising symposiums and pass orders for creating new battlefields. The major problem is that our socio-political leaders never see and never think of the fact that our own fellow brothers and sisters are suffering in the battlefields. They just see the statistics of the war, and statistics never lament, never bleed. In the name of propagation of certain religious sects, some behead the thousands of innocent ones and wish for a comfortable seat in a heaven. How blind are they?
Emperor Ashoka
Emperor Dharmashoka of ancient India saw the Kalinga battlefield and has drastically changed his mind. He gave up winning the territories by war and embraced Buddhism. After that transformation, his ideological slogan was the Dhamma or “righteousness”. He ruled the whole Indian sub-continent not by force but by righteousness. He has obviously proven that one serene word is more powerful than hundreds of brave slogans. Even today we speak of his unparalleled greatness, and supreme qualities of his life as an righteous Emperor.
Ashoka inscriptions and Ashoka pillars speak volumes of his righteous actions and kind-hearted thoughts which are full of serenity. So, peace is not merely a word or a theory, and it can be practiced. But it needs loving-kindness, honesty, and proper understanding of man and universe (or “samma-ditthi”).
Law of nature
Man is not capable of having a complete understanding of the law of nature. The law of nature of the earth is linked with universe and universal energies. So, first we have to understand the law of universe. If we can have a good knowledge of universal energies, then we are in the position of having a sort of knowledge of universe.
Now there are many man-made problems in this computerized age. Many of them are related to our mother earth, our one and only home. The tragedy is today our mother-earth’s resources are in the danger of rapid deterioration. We, all human beings and other species are well nourished by mother earth by giving pathavi-oja (sap or essence of the earth) and pathavi-rasa (taste of earth). Therefore, it is our utmost duty to pay gratitude and respect to our mother earth.
Ethical understanding
Today, we are facing much catastrophic problems like air pollution, water pollution, land pollution, Radiation problems, deforestation, desertification, over-grazing, over-fishing, over-urbanization, and over-industrialization and so on. Man violates his own environment, really his own home, irrespective of the law of nature (or Dhamma). This is a result of the gap between scientific knowledge and ethical understanding. Knowledge without moral foundation is entirely blind. It produces detrimental consequences to whole world. Therefore, the vital base of peaceful society is ethical consideration. Buddhism would say that we should cultivate a sacred and friendly attitude and motherly-affection (matu-sineha) towards our environment.
Animisalochana puja
The Buddha after attaining the Fully-Enlightenment (samma-sambuddhatva) explained us how to have a Great concern and great respect on nature and natural phenomena. The Fully-Enlightened One (samma-sambuddha), during his second week after the Enlightenment, silently taught a great moral lesson to all human beings. As a mark of profound gratitude to the Bo-tree (assattha- in Pali, esatu- in Sinhala, or pippal or pipphali –in Newari and Nepali languages) that sheltered Him during His endeavour for Enlightenment, the Buddha sat down at a certain distance, gazing at the sacred assattha tree with motionless eyes for one whole week. This is called “animisalocana puja”. This first lesson of the Buddha teaches us that our nature should be respected well, and that it further emphasizes that nature requires a very friendly attitude and motherly-affection from human beings.
Socio-economic problems
All the socio-economic and political problems are the results of misguided knowledge and desire (tanha). Man’s extreme tanha or selfishness is responsible for these problems. It appears that solutions rest with changing the hearts of humans and there would be no any other way. Imposing law and legal actions do not entirely support for minimizing these crises. Attitudinal transformation plays the most important role here. So, we need to implement heartfelt ventures. Heart is the seat of feelings and strong emotions. Anger and ill-will can be cooled down by calmness of our heart or practicing meditation. Buddhism, as an ethical teaching, advocates the practice of meditation to eradicate so many ills and evils. It is the greatest medication for so many mental disorders and physical predicaments of modern society. Proper practicing of Buddhist meditation is strong enough to change the heart of man and bringing the solutions to all the problems of modern man.
