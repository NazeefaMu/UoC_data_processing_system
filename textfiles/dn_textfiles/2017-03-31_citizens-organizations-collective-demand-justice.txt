Citizens Organizations Collective demand justice

Citizens Organizations Collective have urged the government not to grant any amnesty to the security force members who have engaged in suppression or attacks against civil society representatives and media personal at the behest of the Rajapaksa regime under the guise of fighting terrorism.
Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday, Citizens Organisations Collective representative Akalanka Hettiarachchi said when the government is acting against such elements of the security forces, Rajapaksa loyalists are alleging that the government is hunting down war heroes.
Several security forces members have been implicated in several criminal cases including the murder of Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickramathunge and the abduction of Journalist Prageeth Eknaligoda. Their families are still fighting for justice.
"We appreciate President Maithripala Sirisena’s statement that he will stand for war heroes who helped crush terrorism, but, he will not defend any security force member found guilty of murdering and attacking civil society members and journalists. However, we have asked the government to reveal the names of those who ave the orders for these acts to be carried out by the security forces members," he said.
"Since MP Wimal Weerawansa’s arrest, many people who had abused powers during the former regime are living in fear. MP Weerawansa does not say that he is innocent of these charges. But, says that others were
also guilty of the same offences. However, he had a chance to become a state witness and reveal the misdeeds of the Rajapaksa regime. If he agreed to such a condition, then we can push for some sort of leniency. But, enaging in a death-fast will not help him win the court cases against him," Hettiarachchi said.
He added that it has been revealed that the EPF has lost Rs.9,500 million as a result of the bond scam . "The cuprites of the case are now staring various business venture and investing money for various projects. We request the government to probe these cases soon and confiscate their wealth looted from the public," he added.
Left Circle Co-convener Chameera Perera said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had said that the government had demeaned the dignity of MP Weerawansa. "But, he has forgotten how he and Weerawansa
demeaned the dignity and tarnished the character of former Cheif Justice Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake. Weerawansa said former Chief Justice Bandaranaike should be sent home in 24 hours. he who has not even passed his O/L insulted Dr.Bandaranayake who appeared before the Committee in Parliament. That is how Weerawansa insulted the judiciary. If the MP had misappropriated public money and property which had benefited his family and associates, now he has to face the consequences. Many culprits responsible for various crimes and racist attacks during the former regime have not been arrested yet. There is no investigation still against 'Bodu Bala Sena' responsible for the Aluthgama incident," he pointed out.
