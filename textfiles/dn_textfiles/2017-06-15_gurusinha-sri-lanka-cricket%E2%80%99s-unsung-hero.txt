GURUSINHA Sri Lanka cricket’s UNSUNG HERO

 The number 3 batting spot is a spot that is usually occupied by the best batsman in the team. That is because he has to be the rock on which a team’s innings is built. From the moment he takes strike, he must be confidence, technique and determination personified.
He must have the ability to act as opening batsman at times. That is because at times he will have to face the new ball in case one of the opening batsmen is out early before the shine is gone off the ball. So it will be seen that a great responsibility rests on the shoulders of the one drop batsman.
Down the ages all teams playing cricket have carried with them some top notch first drop batsmen. It will be too tedious to name them. And one Sri Lankan batsman who adorned this position with great ability and seldom failed his team was ASANKA PRADEEP GURUSINHA.
He seldom failed
From the time GURUSINHA donned pads in this responsible slot, he seldom failed. Many a big total his team built was attributed to GURUSINHA who stood tall defying many a fast bowler, sticking unflinchingly in the middle and inspiring batsmen following how to negotiate the devil in the wicket or the pace or spin and building an innings of great importance to the team.
With clever footwork he cut and drove powerfully and his chief scoring stroke was the well executed admirable lofted off drive that earned him a bag full of runs.
His ability in the one drop position was never better exemplified than when his team was two down early in the 1995/96 history- making World Cup final triumph in Lahore, Pakistan against Australia having lost the two opening blasters in Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaliuwitharne early.
Correct pitch for victory
He partnered the ‘man of the final’ and vice captain Aravinda de Silva to stall the Aussie push putting on a stand of 125 to put the Lankans on the correct pitch for victory. GURUSINHA made a memorable and admirable 65. That is one knock that will be etched in his memory.
When he first served notice of his immense batting prowess at Isipathana and then Nalanda College, he was a burly wicket keeper/batsman with a liking to blast every ball. He had a successful run in school cricket and when he joined the Sinhalese Sports Club that he quickly began to mature and take on responsibility and shape his batting skills that were oozing to finally end up as one of the best left handed willow wielders produced by the country.
He was licked into shape early in his career by coach Raja Athukorale a former Wesley College opening batsman and my work and team mate at ‘The Times of Ceylon’ and my team mate at the Burgher Recreation Club where we helped the Burghers win the ‘Daily News’ and ‘Donovan Andree Trophies’. ‘GURA’ was later coached by Nelson Mendis.
Successful cricket stint
GURUSINHA was born on September 16 1966. After a successful cricket stint at Nalanda as a wicket keeper/batsman, he joined Nondescripts Cricket Club before finally nesting at the adjoining Sinhalese Sports Club, where he proved that he was national class and it was not long when he sported the national cap.
An unforgettable effort was when he partnered Arjuna Ranatunga and batted the entire day at the Colombo Oval to save the Test against a mighty Pakistan side led by all rounder Imran Khan. They became the first two Lankan batsmen to bat throughout the entire day.
On a tour of New Zealand in 1991, he became the second batter after the mercurial Duleep Mendis to score twin hundreds in a Test at Snedden Park, Hamilton making 119 and 102. I was present describing the action for the ‘DAILY NEWS’ and ‘SUNDAY OBSERVERVER’ and savored those two knocks in the company of former West Indies opening bat Bruce Pairadeu.
Nicely poised for victory
At the end of the fourth day, Sri Lanka were nicely poised to record a first Test victory after former opener and later Manager of Sri Lanka cricket team Charith Senanayake led the victory charge with a dashing over 50 innings. But on the final day for no unaccountable reason Sri Lanka put up shutters and a Test that could have ended in a memorable first victory was allowed to peter out into a draw.
Unfortunately GURUSINHA'S career ended prematurely when he was just 29 and at the time his game was at its peak. Today cricketers keep on playing well past their 30s. With GURUSINHA’S early exit Sri Lanka cricket was the loser.
GURUSINHA made his entry into the elite league against Pakistan in the Third Test at Karachi. He played as a wicket keeper owing to an injury suffered by regular wicket keeper Amal Silva.
Was not a dream debut
His debut was not a dream one scoring only 17 and 12 in that Test. Even his ODI debut was a disaster being run out without scoring. GURUSINHA in scoring a fighting 116 against Pakistan in the Third Test in Colombo became the youngest Lanka to make a Test century.
GURUSINHA had aggression writ on his batting always endeavoring to keep the scoreboard moving quickly. But when the need arose he could get bogged down as he showed when he stroked the third slowest hundred of all time when against Zimbabwe in Harare he reached the three figure mark in 535 minutes. He finally made 128 off 461 balls in 607 minutes.
Sensational win for Aussies – sub head
I was present at the SSC in 1992 watching the First Test against Allan Border’ Australians and this story was told to me after the game ended in a sensational victory for Australia. Sri Lanka were well set to register their first ever Test victory against the Aussies.
Aiming at a comparatively easy target of 181 after a formidable start by Roshan Mahanama and Chandika Hathurusinghe were blown away for 164 losing by just 16 runs with ‘GURA’ remaining unbeaten on 31. Unable to believe that a certain victory was finally lost made ‘GURA’ cry like a kid in the pavilion.
Even today where ever fans who watched that match gather, they still can’t understand how Sri Lanka gifted Australia that victory.
GURUSINHA was certainly Sri Lanka cricket’s UNSUNG HERO.
