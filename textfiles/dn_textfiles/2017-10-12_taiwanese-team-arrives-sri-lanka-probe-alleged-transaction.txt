Taiwanese team arrives in Sri Lanka to probe alleged transaction

 
A team of Taiwanese investigators including a Taiwanese bank official arrived in Sri Lanka to carryout investigations, last night.
The Far Eastern International Bank was hacked by means of a computer virus and some US$60 million was wired to the accounts of the suspects at a Sri Lanka bank in Colombo.
The CID initiated an investigation following a complaint made by Bank of Ceylon about this fraudulent money transaction on October 6.
Currently two suspects including suspended Litro Gas Chairman Shalila Moonasinghe are arrested in connection with the alleged transferring of USD 1.1 million from Far Eastern International Bank of Taiwan to their personal accounts in Sri Lanka.
