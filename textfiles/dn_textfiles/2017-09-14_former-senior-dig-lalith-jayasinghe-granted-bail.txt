Former Senior DIG Lalith Jayasinghe granted bail

 Vidya rape and murder case:
Former Senior DIG Lalith Jayasinghe who is alleged to have harboured, concealed and assisted the main suspect in the Vidya Sivaloganathan rape and murder case was granted bail yesterday by the Kayts Magistrate’s Court.
He was released on a cash bail of Rs. 300,000 and four sureties of Rs. 500,000 each.
He was asked to report to the CID headquarters in Colombo on the first Monday of every month.
The Kayts Magistrate also noted that the next hearing of the case will be on December 5. Sivaloganathan was raped and murdered in May 2015 by a group of people.

Police said that Jayasinghe was arrested and charged under Section 209 of the Penal Code for harbouring, concealing and assisting the main suspect in the case Mahalingam Sivakumar alias ‘Swiss Kumar,’ to flee and evade arrest.
Jayasinghe was the Senior DIG of the Kandy Division at the time of arrest.
