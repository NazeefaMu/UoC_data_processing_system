Indian High Commission facilitates youth-exchange programme

The Indian High Commission in Sri Lanka facilitated a youth-exchange programme for students of Lawrence School in Sanawar, India and Royal College, Colombo. A delegation from Sanawar, led by Headmaster Vinay Pande and comprising two teachers and four students from Grade 12, visited Sri Lanka from April 26 to 30. In Colombo, the delegation called on Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at Temple Trees. Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Taranjit Singh Sandhu was also present on the occasion. The delegation visited Royal College, interacted with its students and received exposure to the institution's curricular as well as extra-curricular activities.
The delegation also visited Richmond College in Galle and the historic city of Kandy, where they paid their respects at the Temple of the Tooth Relic and later, participated in Vesak day celebrations at Colombo. The students also interacted with wood craftsmen and local artisans.
The exchange programme is intended to open new avenues for both the schools and to strengthen cultural, educational and people-to-people ties between the two countries. The Lawrence School would be hosting students from Royal College during the coming months as well.
