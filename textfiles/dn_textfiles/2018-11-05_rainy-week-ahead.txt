Rainy week ahead

A low pressure area is likely to develop over the central part of the south Bay of Bengal sea area in the next few days and it is possible that it will move towards Sri Lanka.
Due to this situation, the showery condition is expected to enhance in the island particularly in the Eastern, Uva and North Central Provinces from tonight.
The public and the Naval and fishing communities are requested to be attentive about advisories issued by the Meteorology Department in this regard.
Showers or thundershowers will occur in Northern, Eastern, North Central and Uva Provinces and the Hambantota district.
Showers or thundershowers will occur elsewhere after 2.00 pm.
Heavy rainfall of above 100mm can be expected in some places in the Eastern, Uva and North Central Provinces and Hambantota, Vavuniya and Mannar districts. Misty conditions may occur in some places in the Western, Sabaragamuwa and Central Provinces during the morning.
There may be temporary localised strong winds during thundershowers.
