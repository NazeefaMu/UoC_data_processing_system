‘Padmavati’ has been renamed as ‘Padmaavat’

After much hue and cry over Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s period drama ‘Padmavati’ (original title), the film has finally received a green signal from the CBFC which awarded it a ‘U/A’ certificate with some modifications. Amongst the suggested modifications was the title change of the film.
Speculations were rife that the film has been renamed as ‘Padmavat’, named after the 16th Century epic poem that the film is reportedly an adaptation of. Now, the film’s title has been changed to ‘Padmaavat’ on all its official social media pages.
Currently, banned in Rajasthan, ‘Padmaavat’ is all set to hit the screens on January 25, 2018. However, an official announcement from the producers is awaited. TNN
‘Padmavat’ in 3D and 2D in Hindi and Tamil versions with English subtitles will be releasing from January 25 worldwide and in Sri Lanka. The film is a CEL release and will be screening at MC Colombo, MC Jaffna, Capitol Maradana, Cine City, City Cinema Mount Lavinia (4.15 pm), Plaza Kalutara (4.15 pm), Regal Gampaha, Regal Nuwara Eliya, and Lido Borella (9.00 pm)
