SL, China celebrate 60 years of diplomatic relations

This year marks the 60th anniversary of the diplomatic relationship between China and Sri Lanka. The China-Sri Lanka relationship commenced a long time ago when the Pahian Bhikku visited Sri Lanka, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, the Chinese Government assisted Sri Lanka through several infrastructure development projects such as Port City project, Southern Expressway project, irrigation projects, the OPD construction project of the Colombo National Hospital etc. He was addressing the ceremony held at the BMICH in Colombo recently to mark the 68th Independence Day of China.
Minister Senaratne said that the Chinese provided Rs. 15 million worth emergency assistance for Sri Lanka's flood victims. China is to provide 2,572 metric tons of rice for the people affected by the drought. The number of Chinese tourists visiting Sri Lanka has increased. This is a plus point for Sri Lanka's tourism industry. A total of 271,577 Chinese tourists arrived in Sri Lanka last year and 162,189 Chinese tourists visited Sri Lanka by July, this year.
The political leaders of China and Sri Lanka toured in each other's countries for decades now.
In 1952, former Chinese Prime Minister Zhou Enlai toured in Sri Lanka and the former Sri Lankan Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike toured China in 1961 and 1972. Those visits strengthened the bond between the two countries. China won independence under the leadership of great Chinese leader Mao Zedong on October 1, 1949, he said.
