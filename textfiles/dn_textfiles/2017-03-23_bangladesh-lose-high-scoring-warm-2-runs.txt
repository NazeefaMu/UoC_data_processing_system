Bangladesh lose high-scoring warm-up by 2 runs

 In a high scoring warm-up one-day game where over 700 runs were scored touring Bangladesh narrowly lost to Sri Lanka Board President’s XI by two runs at the CCC grounds yesterday.
The home team ran up an imposing total of 354-7 after being invited to bat first courtesy of powerful half-centuries off the bats of Kusal Perera (64 off 78 balls), Sandun Weerakkody (67 off 54 balls) and Dhananjaya de Silva (52 off 47 balls) and a hard hit 41 off 30 balls from Thisara Perera.
Bangladesh was equal to the task and never gave up their run chase despite losing opener Imrul Kayes to the first ball of the innings. Sabbir Rahman (72 off 63 balls), Mosaddek Hossain (53 off 50 balls), Mahmudullah (71 not out off 68 balls), and captain Mashrafe Mortaza (58 off 25 balls) kept Bangladesh in the hunt until the last ball.
Bangladesh required 13 off the last over but managed only 10 despite a wide being bowled by Thisara Perera.
Bangladesh will take on Sri Lanka in three ODIs commencing Saturday at Dambulla.
Scores: SL Board President’s XI 354-7 in 50 overs (D Munaweera 24, Kusal Perera 64, D Weerakkody 67, M Siriwardana 32, Dhananjaya de Silva 52, Chaturanga de Silva 28, Thisara Perera 41, D Shanaka 26 n.o.)
Bangladesh 352-8 in 50 overs (Soumya Sarkar 47, Sabbir Rahman 72, Mushfiqur Rahim 20, Mosaddek Hossain 53, Mahmudullah 71 n.o., Mashrafe Mortaza 58, A Danajaya 3/61, Chaturanga de Silva 2/53)
