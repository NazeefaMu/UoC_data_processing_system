Immigration official  interdicted for smuggling

An internal investigation has begun on the senior authorised official who was hiding 60 gold biscuits worth Rs. 36 million to be handed over to an outsider.
According to the Emigration and Immigration Controller General, the official has been interdicted and a charge sheet handed over to him.
Investigations are continuing against several other officials who had been charged for similar offences and the punishments will be decided after investigations are over.
The suspect had admitted that he spirited away gold biscuits brought in by a passenger earlier and handed them over to an outsider. Customs confiscated the gold biscuits and imposed a fine of Rs. 3 million.
