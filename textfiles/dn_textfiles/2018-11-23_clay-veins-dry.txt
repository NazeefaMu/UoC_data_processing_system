Clay veins dry up

About 500 families in the Weeraketiya DS area are affected as a result of the acute shortage of clay for their pottery industry. They said clay veins in the area have now dried up.
As such, they have to bring clay from distant places, incurring heavy expenditure. They said they cannot derive a profit as a result.
The availability of aluminium products has also affected demand for their clay products, they said.
