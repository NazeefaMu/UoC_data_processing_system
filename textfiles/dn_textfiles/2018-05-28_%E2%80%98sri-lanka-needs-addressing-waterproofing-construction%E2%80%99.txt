‘Sri Lanka needs addressing waterproofing in construction’

Innovative construction systems and solutions offered by CHRYSO Lanka (Pvt) Ltd for national development in both building and infrastructure projects in Sri Lanka was discussed at a technical session presentation held in Colombo recently.
Key persons in the Road Development Authority, Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau , Colombo Stock Exchange, MG Consultants and Engineering Consultants and prominent structural engineers graced the technical session where a range of innovative products were introduced by Jerome Besnoux, Managing Director CHRYSO Lanka and Trevor Enerson, Project Development Manager Export.
Jerome Besnoux said he aims to provide and continue his efforts to offer the Sri Lankan market a more enhanced and comprehensive product range, solutions and services though his international experiences.
He said the presentation focused on the latest technology offered by them in terms of admixtures and construction systems in order to improve the technical level of the construction industry in Sri Lanka.
Waterproofing is something which is needed to be addressed in Sri Lanka given the quantity of rain per year. Besnoux said that CHRYSO has new technology in that field that will add protection to structures in terms of waterproofing. CHRYSO Lanka would also launch a range of concretes with the latest technology to the Lankan market, he said.
The Managing Director said CHRYSO opened their warehouse in Matara two years ago to supports the company’s projects in the southern expressway and southern railway expansion project.
He said they now plan to move to the centre of the country by opening a warehouse in Dambulla to support the new projects in that region which included the central expressway.

CHRYSO R&D specialists have a deep understanding of physico-chemical interactions and the technical experts have a comprehensive knowledge of materials applications which enable the group to capitalize on a worldwide experience and meet anticipated demands for new admixtures solutions.
Expertise is also enriched locally with the Lanka team of experts which work closely with concrete producers to improve concrete formulations, doing custom trials, on customers’ raw materials so as to better optimize their technical and economical performances.
