Aid sought to preserve  Ruwankanda Rock Temple

 
The ancient Ruwankanda Rock Temple in the Morawak Korale in the Matara district in a dilapidated condition.
The temple is believed to date back to the era of king Valagamaba.
The temple lies at Ruwankanda, Kalubowityangala Kanda close to the Kalubowitiyana-Dewalegama road in the Morawaka area.
Painting of murals and status of the temple faded and several statues were partly broken.
On rainy days water leaks from the decaying roof.
However, new sangawasa building of the temple has been nearly completed now. Chief Incumbent Ven. Dehigaspe Sumanasara Thera said a danasala is being built with the aid of philanthropists.
The dayaka sabha of the temple seek help from the authorities to preserve the historic temple for posterity.
