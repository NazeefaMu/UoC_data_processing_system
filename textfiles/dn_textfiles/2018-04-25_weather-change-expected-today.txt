Weather change expected from today

The Meteorology Department yesterday said a slight change in the prevailing weather could be expected from today.
Showers or thundershowers will occur over most provinces after 2.00 p.m.
Fairly heavy rainfalls above 75mm can be expected at some places, particularly in the Western, Sabaragamuwa, Central and Uva Provinces and in the Galle and Mathara districts. Misty conditions can be expected at some places in the Sabaragamuwa and Central Provinces during the morning.
There may be temporary localised strong winds during thundershowers. The General public is requested to take adequate precautions to minimise damages caused by lightning activity.
