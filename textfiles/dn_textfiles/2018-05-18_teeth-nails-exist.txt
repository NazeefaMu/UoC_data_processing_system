Teeth-nails exist!

After fur nails, you probably thought that you had seen everything. Well, we interrupt your pleasant day to bring you teeth, on fingers. More specifically, molars. Nail Sunny, a nail art chain from Russia, came up with the design, and even they don’t know if it’s a good idea or not.
“Yay or nay?” they asked in a video, presenting the new look. In just 2 days, the clip has been viewed almost 350,000 times on Instagram, and people appear to be leaning towards “nay.” “This is disgusting, very sickening,” one commenter said. “It’s so sad that you guys [are] getting <…> worse. Freaky and not even beautiful,” another claimed.
