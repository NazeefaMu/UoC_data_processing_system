Nurses' strike continues for 7th day

The strike launched by nurses attached to Sri Jayawardenepura General Hospital continued for the <U+200B>seven<U+200B>th day yesterday, Hospital sources said.
According to the sources, the strike was launched last Wednesday opposing the introduction of fingerprint machines to record daily attendance. There is still no positive response from the administration of the hospital for the nurses' demand.
Meanwhile the hospital authorities have suspended some of the daily functions and surgeries due to unavailability of required nurses. Some paying wards have been closed. A court order has been obtained against the strike from Nugegoda District Court.
All Ceylon Nurses' Union sources said that protests will take place opposite all the other state hospitals in the country to support the ongoing strike.
