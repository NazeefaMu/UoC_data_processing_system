Director of Culinary Services, Chef Kithsiri De Silva and his team of expert chefs take a 'no stone unturned' approach, when it comes to the Sunday Brunch.

It is just as pleasing to the eye as they are to the taste buds. A typical Sunday brunch buffet will comprise of fresh salads, Caviar and oyster bar, fresh seafood, artisan breads, soothing soups, delicate sushi and sashimi, hearty rice and pasta dishes, succulent roasts, sizzling BBQ and grills, traditional tandoori corner, Sri Lankan specialties and decadent desserts!
