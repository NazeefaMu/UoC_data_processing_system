Speaker endorses amended LG Bill

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya endorsed the Amended Local Government Authorities Election Bill yesterday.
The Bill passed into law with Amendments in Parliament last Friday, paving the way to hold the LG elections under a new electoral system. The Bill will give effect to legal amendments to hold the LG elections under a mixed system, a hybrid of the first-past-the-post (FPP) and the proportional representation (PR). Sixty percent has been allocated to the FPP representation, while 40 percent has been allocated to PR representation.
The legislation assures 25 percent quota to female representatives and it also abolishes the preferential voting system.Courtesy: Daily News online
