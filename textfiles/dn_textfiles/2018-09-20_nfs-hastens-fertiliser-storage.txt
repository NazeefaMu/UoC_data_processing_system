NFS hastens fertiliser storage

The National Fertiliser Secretariat (NFS) had recently planned to hasten the storage of fertiliser stocks required for the Maha season.
This decision had been taken under the directions of Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera.
The minister had instructed the NFS, the Commercial Fertiliser Company, and the Lanka Fertiliser Company to take necessary measures to supply fertiliser without interruption.
The secretariat had stored 1,000 metric tonnes of fertiliser, including 500 metric tonnes of urea, 300 metric tonnes of Triple Super Phosphate (TSP) and 200 metric tonnes of Muriate of Potash (MOP). Five hundred and twenty metric tonnes of fertiliser, including TSP, Urea, and MOP required for cultivations in the Jaffna peninsula had also been stored.
