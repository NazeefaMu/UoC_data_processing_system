AG decides not to appear for Uva CM

The Supreme Court was yesterday informed that the Attorney General has taken a decision not to appear on behalf of Uva Province Chief Minister Chamara Sampath Dasanayake and other respondents regarding a Fundamental Rights petition filed against them by the Principal of Badulla Tamil Girls’ Maha Vidyalaya.
Accordingly, the Fundamental Rights petition filed by the Principal of Badulla Tamil Girls’ Maha Vidyalaya who was allegedly compelled to kneel down and worship Uva Province Chief Minister Chamara Sampath Dasanayake was yesterday fixed for support on October 25 by the Supreme Court.
Through this petition, the victimised petitioner is seeking a declaration that her Fundamental Rights had been violated by the Chief Minister and provincial educational authorities.
The Supreme Court Bench comprised Justice Buwaneka Aluvihare, Justice Nalin Perera and Justice Vijith Malalgoda.
The petitioner Bavanie Raguath cited Uva Province Chief Minister Chamara Sampath Dasanayake, Uva Provincial Secretary of Education Ministry, Uva Provincial Director of Education Minister and five others as respondents.
The petitioner stated that January 2, 2018 she had received a letter written by a parent to the Uva Chief Minister seeking the Chief Minister’s recommendation to get his daughter admitted to the Badulla Tamil Girls Maha Vidyalaya. The petitioner stated that she was unable to accommodate the aforesaid request since it was contrary to the relevant circulars.
The petitioner further said on January 3, 2018, she had received two telephone calls from the Secrtary to the Ministry of Education Uva Province, requesting her to attend the Provincial Council Office.
The petitioner stated that the Chief Minister had made several impolite, rude comments and inquired about a party thrown for the Uva Province Governor which is merely an allegation tainted with malice. The petitioner further stated in order to get herself excused from the aforesaid terrorising and traumatising situation, she was compelled to kneel down and worship the Chief Minister and pleaded that she is very sorry for any wrong doing from her side. The petitioner stated that she has still not received any favourable response to date. This petition had been filed through Counsel Sunil Watagala and Mayuri Wijesuriya.
