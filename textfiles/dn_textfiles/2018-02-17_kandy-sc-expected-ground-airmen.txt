KANDY SPORTS ROUND-UP:
Kandy SC expected to ground Airmen

Defending champions Kandy Sports Club will go all out to clip the wings of the Airmen and assert their supremacy when they play in their Clifford Cup quarterfinal fixture at Trinity College rugby grounds, Pallekelle today at 4.00 pm. On current form Kandy SC will not have any difficulty in crash landing the Airmen whom they have twice thrashed in the league matches. Kandy is expected to carry on from where they left off last Sunday and continue their winning streak into the knockouts.
For today’s match Kandy SC will include the best young talent they have at their disposal. Kandy SC has been playing cohesive rugby which has unsettled many of their opponents. Another incentive to the Kandy SC side is the encouragement given by their trustee ‘Mr. Rugby’ Malik Samarawickrema. Kandy SC had their final work out last morning and the coaches Sean Wijesinghe and his assistant Saliya Kumara who put the players through their paces has in consultation with the rugby committee decided to make a few changes from the side that played Havelock SC last Sunday. In the forwards play, Kandy SC should get the better of their opponents and give the Colombo lads a torrid time. Their backs have been performing with good understanding as they have proved in the league games. Their backs have regularly provided that extra pace which has made their task easier. Their strong point against Airmen will be their back division. Air Force will be at full strength, but will face a tough task to stop their opponents from going on another scoring spree. A better show is expected from the Airmen. But whatever they do it is going to be a difficult task for them to match the champion Kandy SC outfit.
Postponed AGM on Sunday
The Central Province Rugby referees AMG which was postponed at the eleventh hour last Sunday, will now take place tomorrow Sunday at the same venue Kandy Sports Club pavilion.

It will be ideal if they can bring in an efficient personality as the president.
