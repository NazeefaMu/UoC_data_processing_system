Sudharshani objects decision to dump garbage in JaEla, Ekala

Gampaha District Parliamentarian Sudarshani Fernandopulle expressed her displeasure at the decision that garbage collected from the Colombo Municipality to be dumped in the JaEla and Ekala areas.
She was addressing a press conference at the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Head Office auditorium yesterday.
Fernandopulle said she objects the decision since the people in these areas too would have to face the same fate that the people in Meethotamulla faced. She said be a proper garbage management programme should be formulated to end the issue.
She said the members of SLFP Women’s Organization requested from the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa not to split the party from where he was elected twice the President of this country.
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said it was the former Mahinda Rajapaksa who handed over the chair of SLFP to the President Maithripala Sirisena. He questioned as to what the SLFP members do rather than going after the leadership. He said former President is responsible for the current crisis in the SLFP.
