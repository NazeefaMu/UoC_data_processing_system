Tablets for all AL students by 2018 end

Tablet computers will be distributed to 200,000 Advanced Level students islandwide beginning in January, Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando said.
The remarks were made in a speech Fernando gave to the United Nations’ sponsored #WeAre2030 Youth Dialogue and Incubation Programme, held at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall on Wednesday evening.
“The tablets for 200,000 A-level students will start in January.The tender has been given.”
Fernando conceded that the tender process if appealed, as tenders in the country usually are, might result in the delayed distribution of the tablets. Still, he insisted that even with a two-month delay, students should have tablets in hand by the end of the year.
“Imagine that 200,000 students will be able to take a tablet home, students from Ampara, Jaffna, Polonnaruwa, Galle, Hambantota, Badulla. These devices will be in houses, seen by parents. Things are starting to change,” Fernando said.
