Free at last

The curtain finally came down on the 54 nightmarish days the nation was forced to go through, beginning October 26th, with the swearing-in of the new Cabinet of Ministers by President Maithripala Sirisena at the Presidential Secretariat yesterday morning. A hitherto largely disoriented populace, no doubt, would have heaved a huge sigh of relief after the tension, uncertainty and chaos they were forced to endure when the country was caught up in a vortex of political turmoil for more than one and half months. They certainly would be breathing the fresh air of freedom.
The abrupt turnaround of the political climate and the easing of tensions, no doubt, would be most welcomed by all Christians who are on the threshold of ushering in Christmas in a few days time. Already there are palpable signs of this change everywhere where firecrackers greeted the swearing-in of the new Cabinet in the towns and villages along with the partaking of kiribath which has now become a common symbol of celebrations in this country.
More importantly, the installation of the new Cabinet would also now serve to dispel all doubts and ambiguities in the minds of public officials who were reluctant to commit themselves all these days fearing repercussions. They could now get back to their work in earnest with the establishment of a legal Government following yesterday's appointment of the Cabinet.
The new Government should not lose time resting on its laurels but get down to business right away. The crisis had taken a heavy toll on the economy (the loss to country had been estimated at Rs. 220 billion). Besides, a heavy blow has also been dealt to the image of the country after the high we had reached in the early days of the Yahapalanaya Government. The crisis has also left behind a badly fractured polity at a time the crying need is for unity to overcome the enormous challenges confronting the nation. Both President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe should now bury the hatchet and work in unison to pull back the country from the pits it had fallen into due to the ill advised move of the former. There are plenty of ways where differences could be overcome without treading on each other's corns. The future of the country is too important to let personal egos stand in the way of progress.
This is also a time for calm reflection to ascertain the causes that led to the precipitate action of the President and steps taken for non-recurrence of the events of October 26.There may have been lapses and differences on both sides and these should be ironed out by frank discussions. It is gratifying to note that President Sirisena and Premier Wickremesinghe had met for discussions prior to the formation of the new Cabinet indicating a thaw in the hitherto hostile relationship between the duo. Such dialogues should continue, if for no other reason than maintaining stability. This would also inspire public officials to work in unison and harmony, doubling their efforts.
The public would also welcome the downsizing of the Cabinet to a considerable degree, although a 30 member Cabinet is still considered by most to be excessive, given that India, with a population of 1.2 billion, has only a 25 ministers in the Lok Sabha. No doubt political compulsions and configurations have forced upon this situation in the case of Sri Lanka which has cost the taxpayer plenty. In the immediate post-independence era the Cabinets consisted of only a handful of ministers who performed with aplomb, attested to by the fact that there were predictions that we would even leapfrog Singapore on the development front. There is therefore no reason that this lot cannot emulate their predecessors in office.
There is however a need for a corruption-free administration. True, the vast support received by Premier Wickremesinghe during the days of the crisis was chiefly for the restoration of democracy and constitutional Government. But it is also equally true that the public yearned for a course correction in Government reminiscent of the January 8 battle cry.
Premier Wickremesinghe should keep his minions in check and strive to ensure a clean administration. We say this because major elections are round the corner and this fund of goodwill demonstrated by the public towards Prime Minister during the crisis, if it is to be kept intact, should be demonstrated with results, both in terms of performance and clean governance.
On the performance front, he (Wickremesinghe) is now not encumbered by the UPFA/SLFP component of the Unity Government which always blocked the implementation of UNP policies in the mistaken belief that these policies are detrimental to the public good. He now has a free hand to implement his vision for the country with no one now to breathe down his neck. Of course the President who, no doubt, has his eye on the impending elections may try to play spoil sport. But Premier Wickremesinghe who is an old hand in the game will certainly know how to handle things. After all, did he not overcome the greatest challenge to his political career?
