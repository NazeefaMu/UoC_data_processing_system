CASE AGAINST D. V. Upul
AG’s advice SOUGHT

The CID conducting investigations against UPFA Southern Provincial Councillor D.V. Upul for allegedly making threatening remarks against the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID), has sought the Attorney General’s advice regarding the future legal action against the suspect.
When the case pertaining to the matter came up before Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara, the CID informed Court that they have concluded investigations into the incident and abstracts of the investigation have been forwarded to the Attorney General for his advice. Further magisterial inquiry has been fixed for April 5.
Addressing a public gathering on May 31, 2015 D.V.Upul had allegedly threatened to stone to death the officers attached to the FCID ,once Mahinda Rajapaksa returned to power as the Prime Minister in the country.
The CID had launched an investigation into the controversial statement made by the Provincial Council Minister following these remarks directed at the FCID.
“Collect the name-list of FCID officers from Police Constable to DIG. They should be stoned to death when Mahinda Rajapaksa becomes Prime Minister of this country. We are waiting till that day arrives. If someone in the government opposes that, we will take to the streets against the government,” Upul had told the gathering.
The Provincial Council Minister made this remark in the presence of UPFA Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa and several other local politicians representing the Hambantota district.
