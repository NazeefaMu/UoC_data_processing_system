Remanded till Sept.18 on bribery charges

Former Import and Export Controller Mahagamage Gamini, who was arrested for allegedly demanding a bribe of Rs.200,000 from a businessman was remanded till September 18 by Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake yesterday.
Officers of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) told the Magistrate that investigations have not been complete. Gamini had allegedly solicited a bribe of Rs.200,000 from a businessman in Weligama to provide a report containing recommendations necessary to import two vehicles from Japan, which are around 10 years old, through legal channels.
Attorney-at-Law appearing on behalf of the suspect informed the Magistrate that his client’s wife and daughter were suffering from a serious health condition. Attorney-at-Law also pleaded his client be granted bail.
After considering all matters, the Magistrate ordered the Attorney-at-Law to submit his written submission to the Court Registrar two days prior to the next calling date.
