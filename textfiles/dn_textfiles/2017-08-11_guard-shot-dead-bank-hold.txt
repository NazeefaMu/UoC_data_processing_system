Guard shot dead in bank hold up

Two security guards were shot during an armed robbery at a private bank yesterday afternoon in the Attidiya area. One of the guards died on the spot while the other suffered critical injuries.
Two suspects wearing full-face helmets had opened fire on the security guards at the bank, police said. The suspects fled the scene on the motorcycle they came on after robbing an undisclosed amount of money from the bank.
They had robbed cash from a bank customer on their way out.
Mount Lavinia Police have launched a man hunt to arrest them, police said.
