Drought relief: President calls for UN, FAO, WFP involvement

The United Nations and its affiliated bodies would take serious note of the impending drought situation in Sri Lanka and assured President Maithripala Sirisena that they would extend the fullest cooperation to the Presidential Task Force to provide relief.
Top level UN officials, including, UN Resident Coordinator and UNDP Resident Representative, Una McCauley, the World Food Programme’s (WFP) Representative and Country Director for Sri Lanka, Brenda Barton and Chief Technical Advisor at FAO Emelda Berejena called on President Sirisena at the Presidential Secretariat on Monday to discuss issues pertaining to the drought and relief organisation.
The UN top officials thanked the President for establishing a Task Force to monitor and supervise drought relief and assured they would take steps to bring the impending calamity to the notice of the international community and seek their assistance.
The UN representative said as the first step, the UN could provide expertise in monitoring, evaluation and communication regarding the drought.
The WFP representative said her organisation could extend the food or cash for work programme to provide employment to rural people denied work due to the drought. She said that food/cash for work programme is in operation in several districts. Assurance of income to people would prevent them from indebtedness as there are instances of private money lenders providing the poor with loans on exorbitant interest rates. She added that the people should be encouraged to take loans from government agencies that provide soft loans.
The UN officials said one of the main problems of the drought is the drinking water shortage and that would lead to health issues. They also discussed the issue of finding bowsers to supply water to drought affected areas.
The President thanked the UN Heads for their concern over the drought situation and invited them to attend the Task Force meetings every week to further monitor the situation.
