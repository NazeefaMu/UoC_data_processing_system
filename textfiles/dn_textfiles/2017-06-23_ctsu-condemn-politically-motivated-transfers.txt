CTSU condemn politically motivated transfers

Ceylon Teacher Services Union (CTSU) yesterday, condemned the several politically motivated transfers given on the direct involvement of Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam to teachers and Principals in schools in the Kurunegala area.
“We condemn the moves of the Education Minister of using the teacher service for political purposes,” said General Secretary of Ceylon Teacher Services Union Mahinda Jayasinghe adding that a number of teachers of schools in Kurunegala have been subjected to political revenge with the knowledge of the Education Minister.
He said no teacher should be subjected to physical punishment or mental harassment when he or she is transferred under the provisions of the national teacher transfer policy.
“But, many teachers in the Kuliyapitiya Central Colleges have already been politically victimized. It was the school where Education Minister studied.
Ceylon Teacher Services Union’s Kuliyapitiya Zone’s President has also been transferred without showing any reason and proper investigation.
If there are politically victimized persons, proper investigation should be held and solutions found without resorting to actions like this. Although, he submitted an appeal, the Principal of the Kuliyapitiya Central College had refused to accept it.
The Principal had also allegedly tried to assault one of the teachers of the school. He is said to have admitted children to school unlawfully,” he said.
“Education suffers a setback when such violent people are recruited to the education service. Teachers have been subjected to intimidation and harassments by him and we have made a complaint to the Human Rights Commission in this regard,” added Jayasinghe.
