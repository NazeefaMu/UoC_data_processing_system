Kalu Ganga Reservoir 90 percent complete

Construction work on the Kalu Ganga Reservoir project which will feed the Moragahakanda reservoir, the final reservoir under the Mahaweli Development Scheme, is almost 90 percent complete, Resident Manager Hemantha Dedigama said.
He said the total capacity of this reservoir which has a 7.85 kilometre tunnel is 248 million cubic metres.
Speaking at a press conference recently, Dedigama said the Kaluganga Reservoir will release water to Moragahakanda at the rate of 35 cubic metres per second (35 cusecs).
Today, the Kalu Ganga Reservoir is filled to eight percent of its capacity.
The Kalu Ganga Reservoir will provide irrigation to farmer families displaced by the Moragahakanda Reservoir and will release its excess water to Moragahakanda through the underground tunnel.
The Kalu Ganga project is funded by the Kuwait Fund.
