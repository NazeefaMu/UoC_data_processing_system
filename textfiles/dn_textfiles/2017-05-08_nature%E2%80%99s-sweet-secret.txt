Nature’s sweet secret

This rare flower called ‘Rattan Flower ‘or ‘Wewel-mala’ is found behind the ‘Awasa-ge’ of Merekele ‘Aranya Senasanaya ‘ close to Thalawitiya, nearly seven kilo metres off the Eheliyagoda town. The oval-shaped flower has no petals like that of other flowers. A sweet-smelling, fully-bloomed Rattan flower would remain for weeks before it withered.
