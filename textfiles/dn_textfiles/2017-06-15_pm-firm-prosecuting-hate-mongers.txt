PM firm on prosecuting hate mongers

Police, AG to initiate action against instigators:
The law enforcement authorities have been directed to initiate immediate action against hate speech, perpetrators and instigators of violence against religious and ethnic groups, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
Making a special statement to the media at Temple Trees, the Premier said Police have been directed to take legal action against those who engage in communal, ethnic and religious hatred, violence and hate speech.
He said if someone engages in communal, ethnic and religious hatred and violence and hate speech, measures will be taken to inquire, arrest and produce the offenders before court.
He said new laws too will be passed by Parliament, to curb intolerance.
The PM said this decision was a reaffirmation of the policy of the National Unity Government, headed by President Maithripala Sirisena, in accordance with the mandates received from the people at the Presidential election on January 8, 2015 to ensure the country never returns to a conflict-ridden past, and instead resolve to guide our nation towards reconciliation.
He added that we have decided to get together and march forward after the end of 30 year prolonged war. He also said that accordingly all the Police stations and related institutions have been informed to maintain law and order.
“I am proud to be Sinhala Buddhist,” PM stated. “In the same maner I am proud to be a Sri Lankan. As a Sri Lankan I respect all religions and cultures. If someone hate other religions and cultures he canot be accepted as a Sri Lankan. The good governance government would guarantee equal rights and ensure an environment that all could live peacefully.”
The premier also pointed out that the country was affected by the religious conflicts in 2014 and the unity among communities was damaged. He said the same incidents affected the image of the country. “We cannot repeat the same,” Premier Wickremesinghe said. “We would not allow to repeat them too.”
He said that Police has been instructed to investigate into the incident of attacking several Muslim businesses and mosques. He added that the Police will bring the situation back to normal.
He also added that the those incidents are being investigated by the Police and at several incidents Police had implemented the law. He assured that none of those matters had been given up by the government.
