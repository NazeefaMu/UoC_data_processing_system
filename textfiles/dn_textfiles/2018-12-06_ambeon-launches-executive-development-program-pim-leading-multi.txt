Ambeon launches Executive Development Program with PIM Leading multi-discipline conglomerate

Ambeon Group recently launched an Executive Development Program (EDP) aided by the Postgraduate Institute of Management (PIM), the nation’s management mentor.
A program especially tailor-made for the Ambeon Group, this programme was designed by PIM to provide a rich learning experience, helping to develop the managerial and strategic level competencies needed for sustenance, growth, development and sustainability of the organization for the future.
Comprising 25 senior and middle managers, the inaugural batch of this EDP has already directly and actively contributed at several levels of the Group, positively impacting many functions and initiatives. Further, while participants have benefited from their own individual performances the programme enables sharing of ideas, experiences and helps foster innovation and best practices across the group.
Prof. Ajantha S. Dharmasiri, Director of PIM, who delivered the welcome address at the inauguration of EDP, signaled that the ability to change is key in today’s business world, and how dynamic leaders need to be comfortable with embracing change, stating that they need to thrive in change by becoming a victor in change rather than its victim.
“The objective of our partnership with PIM is to enhance and improve competencies within our senior management while embracing a learning culture within the Group as a whole,” signaled Murali Prakash, Group Managing Director/CEO of Ambeon Capital PLC and Ambeon Holdings PLC.
“In today’s world, change is experienced at a rapid pace than ever before. It is also our biggest challenge. Through programmes of this nature, Ambeon is ready today for tomorrow’s business challenges”.
Prakash also said, “The Ambeon Group has transformed to be a medium sized conglomerate through targeted acquisition, restructure, legal and GRC. Today, we are a properly restructured legal entity, building capacity and capability to take on the challenges of tomorrow, while ensuring its diverse and technocentric customers continue to be satisfied. We have also spent a lot of time and effort up-skilling our workforce to take on future-oriented strategic projects, which relies on project-based learning that can be implemented within the Group. These include cross posting initiatives to build redundancies and empathy within our pool of talent.”
Commenting on the Group’s strong learning and innovation culture, Prakash said, “At Ambeon, one of our key aims is to build clear career paths with professional development through continuous learning for career and self-advancement. Ambeon also thrives on continuously developing and maintaining a ‘Train-the-Trainer’ mindset among each staff member who after attending our trainings are then encouraged to, in turn, pass on their knowledge and lessons learnt to colleagues and subordinates.”
