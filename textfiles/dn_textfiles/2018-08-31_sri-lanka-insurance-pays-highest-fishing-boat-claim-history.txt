Sri Lanka Insurance pays highest  fishing boat claim in history

Sri Lanka Insurance paid the highest recorded claim for a fishing boat ever, Rs.29 Mn to the insured W.P.M.R.D.R Fernando owner of the fishing boat IMUL A 844 CHW.
Built in 2018, the fishing boat has been completely destroyed after it caught fire on her maiden voyage, making a total loss.
The Sri Lanka Insurance is the first insurance company in the country to have been assigned a global rating for financial stability, AA+ (lka) from Fitch Ratings, London which is an assurance of the company’s long-term financial sustainability. The company has also been awarded ISO 9001:2015 certification for correct governing and operational procedures in line with accepted global standards.
