IGP UNDER probe

The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) conducting the probe into the alleged assassination plot of President Maithripala Sirisena and former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, will begin investigations on the allegations made against the Inspector General of Police (IGP) Pujitha Jayasundara.
He is said to have taken back the cheque of Rs. 500,000 given to police informant Namal Kumara with a reprimand to stop forthwith all that said and done in respect of the alleged assassination plot. According to the complaint Namal Kumara had made to the CID about the assassination plan, on a day in September this year, he (Namal Kumara) had gone to the Police headquarters with the former DIG Nalaka de Silva to receive money, a gift given by the Police in the presence of several police officers and photographers. The IGP handed over the cheque to Namal Kumara, and had taken back the cheque with a dire warning to stop forthwith, all that was said and done in respect of the alleged assassination plot.
In his complaint to the CID, he had referred to incident and had said that he had thought the IGP, assuming that he (Namal) was ready to disclose all relevant information of the alleged assassination plot, he was given a strong warning against disclosing anything about the assassination plot. He never expected a warning of this sort and felt rather disturbed and uneasy, Namal Kumara in his complaint to the CID had said.
In his complaint Namal Kumara had said that the alleged cheque was written to ex-DIG Nalaka de Silva’s name and not to his (Namal’s) name.
The information Namal Kumara had given to the CID, with regard to the alleged assassination plot, includes names of two politicians and names of two State officials. He has also said that although not connected to the plot, one other politician had the knowledge of the assassination. Although I did not get the envelop containing the plan and advice to go about the assassination plan, all that contain in his phone, which has gone erased. the said phone has by now sent to overseas.
There is also a plan to disclose name of another person at a meeting scheduled to be held on December 5 at Maha Oya Ampara, which Namal Kumara has not so far referred to in the CID statement. It is claimed that the person whose name is to be disclosed is still working as a state official.
The organiser of the said meeting has sought police protection.
