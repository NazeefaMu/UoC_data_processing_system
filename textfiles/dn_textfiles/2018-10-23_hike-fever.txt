Hike fever!

We’ve seen many Insta-famous pets recently, but we’ve never come across a dog quite as beautiful as Troja. The majestic Irish Setter spends her time exploring the Norwegian wilderness with her human, photographer George Rotan, who shares their adventures on Instagram. Now with over 140,000 followers, the inseparable duo have won the hearts of many.
“Troja always came with me on hikes, but I never thought about photographing her until people on the trail started complimenting her looks,” reveals Rotan.
“Since I’ve started taking pictures of her, it’s created more of an interaction between us on our hikes. It’s led to a very strong companionship.”
The photographer’s Instagram gallery showcases their incredible bond, but also the beauty of the surrounding landscape. From trails among lush, green forests to doggy paddles in picturesque lakes, each image is sure to give you a case of wanderlust. Troja is captured majestically surveying the landscape and playfully pouncing through snow, all while faithfully following Rotan wherever he goes.
Despite their adventurous lifestyle, Troja wasn’t always so outgoing. When Rotan first adopted her in 2012, she was almost too anxious to go to a new home. “Troja was very weak and insecure as a pup, but she had such a soulful, unique personality,” says Rotan. “I instantly fell in love with her and vowed to help her get better.” After slow introductions to new places, people, dogs, and even wild animals, Troja eventually grew into the spirited dog she is today. “Being with her throughout her process has had such a huge impact on my life and personal development as well,” reveals Rotan. “She’s shown me why humans and dogs have coexi sted so peacefully for thousands of years.”
