Japan promises more aid for infrastructure development

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said that Japan is ready to grant financial aid to Sri Lanka to strengthen friendship between the two countries.
“Japan will provide non-loan financial aid at every possible moment to Sri Lanka for infrastructure development and other development activities” he said.
The Japanese Prime Minister was speaking at the banquet accorded to President Maithripala Sirisena and First Lady Jayanthi Sirisena at the Japanese Prime Minister’s Office last evening.
Japan continues its support towards Sri Lanka’s development activities in several fields including naval, highways and energy sectors.
“Japan will provide non-loan financial aids to Sri Lanka at any occasion as Sri Lanka is a long-standing friend of Japan” he noted.
