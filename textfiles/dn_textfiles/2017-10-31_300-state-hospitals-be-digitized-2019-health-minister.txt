300 state hospitals to be digitized by 2019: Health Minister

 
A programme to digitize 300 state hospitals by 2019 will commence from the Horana Base Hospital, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said.
Minister Senaratne said that in 2014, expired drugs worth Rs. 350 million were destroyed because there was no proper drug distribution system in the country at that time.
He said this while addressing a ceremony held to hand over seven mobile dental units and 50 computers to state hospitals at the Family Health Bureau in Colombo recently.
‘But now state hospitals have been networked and a software has been introduced to ensure the proper distribution of drugs among state hospitals. Nothing can be done today without digitization and modern technology’, the Minister said.
The seven mobile dental units and 50 computers provided for state hospitals are worth Rs. 407 million, the Minister said.
There was a shortage of 44 to 79 drugs due to the non availability of information on drug stocks online. But after introducing the new software all artificial drug shortages in the country ended, he added.
