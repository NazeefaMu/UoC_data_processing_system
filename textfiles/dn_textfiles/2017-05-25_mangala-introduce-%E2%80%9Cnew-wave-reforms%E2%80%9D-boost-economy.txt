Mangala to introduce a “new wave of reforms” to boost economy

Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said he will bring in a “new wave of reforms” which will take Sri Lanka forward as a “modern, dynamic and democratic economy”.
The minister in his first speech in Parliament said his target is to ensure that the country becomes the hub of the Indian Ocean by 2020. On resurrecting the economy, Minister Samaraweera said the private sector should be the engine of growth and its contribution was vital for development.
“Financial discipline was ruined due to crony capitalism and dictatorial rule. For the last two years, my predecessor under the leadership of the Prime Minister went to great efforts to put the economy back on the right track.
We regained the confidence of the international community. Our leaders are well-received anywhere they go in the world,” he said. The minister also said that extremism and corruption should be wiped out to achieve economic prosperity and promised to put his maximum effort to rebuild the debt-ridden economy.
