Moves to keep elephants at bay

Steps will be taken to provide security to residents against wild elephant attacks in the Vellavali Divisional Secretariat Division in Batticaloa. The Wildlife Conservation Department will seek Army assistance to drive away elephants rampaging into the areas inhabited by people.
This decision was taken at a meeting presided by Batticaloa District Secretary P.S.M. Charles at the Porativupattu Pradesheeya Sabha hall on Wednesday to find solutions to the human elephant conflict in Vellavali.
This followed directives issued by Minister Gamini Jayawickrema Perera to find urgent solutions to the problems faced by residents in Vellavali due to wild elephants.
Wildlife Department representatives said a team of department employees from Anuradhapura will be deployed to tranquillise elephants invading villages in the area and release them to the Habarana Elephant Park.
Parliamentarians S. Viyalendran and G. Sivinesan, Eastern Provincial Council Agriculture Minister K. Thurairajasinham and Council Vice Chairman Prasanna Indrakumar also attended the meeting.
