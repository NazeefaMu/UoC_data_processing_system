SL, India focus on Indian Ocean identity

The importance of working towards the creation of an Indian Ocean identity while joining a collective endeavour in the Indo-Pacific region was emphasised during talks between Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj, in New Delhi on Saturday.
The importance of further widening the tasks of the Indian Ocean conference organised by the India Foundation was also emphasised during the talks, a press release from the Prime Minister’s Office said.
Swaraj said India would extend its full support towards the all-party plan spearheaded by Sri Lanka towards free navigation in the Indian Ocean.
During the talks, Swaraj also thanked Prime Minister Wickremesinghe for his efforts to further consolidate and enhance the historic friendship and relations between India and Sri Lanka. The talks also centred on regional problems.
Since both Sri Lanka and India bought petroleum from Iran, Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga requested India’s advice regarding the steps to be taken in case sanctions were imposed on Iran. Swaraj who explained India’s policy on the matter said Sri Lanka too could adopt it. Indian officials present said they would provide information regarding the matter to Minister Ranatunga in due course.
Attention was also drawn to North–East development work and the opportunities for accelerating such work.
Ministers Sagala Ratnayaka and Malik Samarawickrama, Prime Minister’s Secretary Saman Ekanayake, Sri Lankan High Commissioner in India Chitrangani Wagiswara, Additional Secretary to the President, Saman Attaudahetti, Deputy High Commissioner M.R.K. Lenagala and special assistant Sandra Perera were also present on the occasion.
