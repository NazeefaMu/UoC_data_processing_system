Huawei join hands with Just in Time Group for CSR in Deniyaya

Huawei, a leading global information and communications technology (ICT) company joined hands once again with Just In Time Group (JIT) a Sri Lankan owned ICT Systems Integration Company to initiate a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activity in Deniyaya.
The initiative was brought forward in order to support students who have been affected by the recent floods which occurred in that region.
Affected children from Deniyaya received donations of school bags, each containing educational appliances necessary for their study needs, which would help them continue with their schooling. The CSR event was patronized by Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, Minister of Law and Order and Southern Development, Sagala Ratnayaka, Huawei Sri Lanka CEO Shunli Wang and other dignitaries.
Deniyaya was reported to have encountered massive landslides and persistent rains, especially in the area of Morawaka Kanda, which had resulted in a number of deaths and displaced residents. School children were affected due to this epidemic.
In light of these events, requests from benefactors which included Huawei and JIT decided to come forward and assist flood affected students with their education. School children had their books and educational material destroyed as a result of these rains.
Previously, Huawei had also collaborated with JIT as strategic partners to work together in projects that were aimed towards supporting Sri Lanka’s ICT and digital economy. Many initiatives that Huawei had conducted in their quest to empower Sri Lanka’s futuristic goals through CSR, ‘Seeds for the Future’ was one such initiative which took place recently supporting and sponsoring young minds from state universities who were selected to travel to the Huawei Headquarters in Shenzhen, China on a study trip.
Commenting on the initiative that was taken by Huawei, Huawei Sri Lanka CEO Shunli Wang stated, “We were saddened to witness the recent epidemic which Sri Lanka had to endure recently. We identified with the areas that highlighted their need for assistance. Huawei decided to join hands with our strategic partners JIT and provide support to young school children who were especially affected by this issue.”
The purpose of this concept that was introduced to Sri Lanka was to enable opportunities for networking and the chance to connect with the rest of the world with the hope of exchanging latest technologies and best practices which would one day prove influential for Sri Lanka’s evolving digital landscape.
The CSIC was also endorsed by the Minister of Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Harin Fernando as an ideal learning centre which would benefit youth and students through excursions and get to witness the innovations of a global ICT company.
