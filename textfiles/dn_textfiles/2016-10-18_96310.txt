26th Mercantile League basketball tournament: Commercial Credit retains Men’s ‘A’ division crown

 
Commercial Credit retained the Men’s ‘A’ division title for another year when they defeated Union Assurance by 53 points to 37 in the final at the 26th Mercantile League basketball tournament held at Henry Pedris courts.
Commercial Credit were always the favorites with their star studded line up and they lived upto expectations taking a commanding lead and maintaining it comfortably. They led 28-17 at half time.
Sri Lanka National players Cliton Stallone and Thimothi Nithushan played well for the winners.
The men’s ‘B’ division final saw Dialog get the better of unbeaten John Keells 66-51 after holding onto a slender six points lead at the half 27-21.
John Keels came unbeaten to the finals with dominant performances over all the teams. Dialog had lost to John Keels in the group stage but were in control in the final from the start. John Keels had a good second quarter cutting the deficit but Dialog covered all areas well and used their bench very well to take the win and bag this year’s ‘B’ division men’s title. Ravi Wickramasinghe was in fine form for Dialog.
