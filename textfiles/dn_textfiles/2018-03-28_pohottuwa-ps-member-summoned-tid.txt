A Kundasale PS member who was elected to the council by Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (Pohottuwa) at the recently concluded Local Government election has been summoned to the Terrorist Investigation Division (TID) today to obtain a statement in connection with the recent mob attack on religious places and business establishments in the Digana area in Kandy.
The PS member in question has been summoned to the TID based on information that he was allegedly involved in mob violence that erupted in Digana in the Kandy district,
The PS member when contacted by the Daily News said that he was not involved in any type of incidents which had taken place in Digana or elsewhere in the Kandy district.
