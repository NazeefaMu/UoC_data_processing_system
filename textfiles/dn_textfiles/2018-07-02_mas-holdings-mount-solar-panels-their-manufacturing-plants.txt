MAS Holdings mount solar panels in their manufacturing plants

MAS Holdings (Pvt.) Ltd., the region’s number one design to delivery apparel and textile solutions provider, recently announced the launch of its pioneering renewable energy drive ‘Photon’. Implemented in line with the group’s key environmental goals, Photon will see the installation of 24 rooftop Solar PV Systems covering an extensive 2,000,000 sqft, spanning from Kilinochchi to Koggala.
Following the successful launch of its 1 MW Solar PV System at its facility in Thulhiriya in 2015, deemed at the time as South Asia’s largest rooftop PV installation, the apparel conglomerate has set its sights on steering one of the largest multi-site rooftop solar initiatives in the world and through this Photon was born. Commissioning of the first two strategic phases is already underway and will realise a combined capacity of over 20MW. There is a hint of a third phase in the near future, which could augment this by a further 7MW of renewable energy.
MAS has adopted a three-pronged environmental strategy: to take radical climate action on renewable energy, to continuously manage the impact of its footprint and to restore habitats across 100 times the size of its operational area.
Photon will serve as a business unit to channel renewable energy income towards one source, thereby garnering a stable fund to support future renewable energy opportunities. Staying abreast of global environmental trends while meeting the local sustainable environmental goals, Team Photon is also preparing to venture into next generation solutions for battery storage.
MAS plans to have a Net Positive impact in our energy space by 2025. “It’s time we move beyond the simple cost benefit lens of switching to solar. We need to invest because the cost of doing nothing is far greater. Energy is no longer a right, it is a responsibility. Photon is an investment that will help us reach that goal and also send a clear message that this is the new norm for industry now,” Shirendra Lawrence, Chief Operating Officer of MAS Holdings said.
Photon is being implemented to support the electricity needs of each of the 24 locations, whilst providing electricity to the National Grid under the government’s ‘Surya Bala Sangramaya’ drive.
MAS Holdings manages a portfolio of businesses with a revenue of USD 1.8bn and is positioned as one of the world’s most recognized design to delivery solution providers in the realm of apparel and textile manufacturing.
