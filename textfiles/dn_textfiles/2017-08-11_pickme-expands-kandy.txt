PickMe expands to Kandy

In a strategic move to expand its presence across the country, leading taxi-hailing app in Sri Lanka, PickMe launched its brand in the city of Kandy recently.
The launch came after PickMe commenced its operations in Kandy one year back, as part of a soft launch.
The launch was held at the Kandy City Centre and was graced by PickMe Chairman Ajit Gunewardene, Chief Executive Officer Jiffry Zulfer, board members and PickMe employees.
Speaking at the event, PickMe Chairman Ajit Gunewardene said, “We are enabling Sri Lankan driver entrepreneurs to grow personally and professionally by building a robust ecosystem via PickMe and the app directly fuels the growth of mobility in Sri Lanka.”
PickMe introduced exciting promotional pricing for its Kandy passengers and the company will be rolling out several other exclusive offers for Kandy during the upcoming months. The new PickMe office is located at Primrose Road, Kandy.
As the largest organised taxi platform in Sri Lanka, PickMe currently services the Colombo region's complete transportation needs and maintains a base of over half a million registered users of the PickMe app and a taxi fleet of over ten thousand, including three wheelers, mini cars, cars and vans.
