THE DAY THAT JOES RECTOR TOOK THE ‘CANE’

March 5, 2016 on the final day of the 82nd Battle of the Saints cricket match played at the P.Sara Oval Stadium, the Rector of St. Joseph’s College (SJC) Rev.Fr. Travis Gabriel on conclusion of the game which came to an abrupt end made a magnanimous gesture by awarding the game to the rival school St. Peter’s College (SPC) who was robbed and denied their victory by seven runs due to the following facts. There were two factions who should take responsibility of this unwanted, ugly and unsporting acts that took place on the grounds tarnishing their rich school values to zero levels.
JOSEPHIAN CRICKET TEAM
Unsporty behavior of the Joes players who took 65 minutes to bowl 56 balls (9.2 overs) when the target was 66 runs to get in 12 overs in the Peterite second innings. One of the Joes fast bowlers almost took 15 minutes to complete his over in fading light. This particular bowler gave away 5 wides during his brief spell.
Rev. Fr. Travis Gabriel
I understand that no school wishes to get defeated at their annual big match. In today’s context any school will use “DELAYING TACTICS” to avoid a defeat. Understood. But, it cannot be to the extent the way the eleven Josephian players used dirty “tactics”.
(a) Wicket-keeper walking up from his stumps keeping position (for a fast bowler) to the other end - bowling mark to give instructions to the bowler (when he is not the skipper). Spectators understood those instructions, it was to bowl wide out of the off stump or leg stump where the batsmen could not reach the ball which resulted out of the 59 runs scored by the Peterites there were 7 wides to prove the negative bowling approach of the Joes fast bowlers.
(b) Time duration taken for the field placing and for the constant changing of fielding positions with players which made it very ugly.
(c) When throwing the “dead ball” back to the bowler and all those fielders not holding it, after dropping the ball to fetch it (at one point ball went rolling up to the fence) with all these acts it proved beyond doubt their intentions.
(d) After the fall of every SPC wicket (4 wickets went down) during their run chase, spectators witnessed some Joes players inviting their supporters to invade the ground and the saddest part was when these players posed for “Selfie pictures” along with their supporters during the ground invasion.
JOSEPHIAN UNRULY SUPPORTERS
Now let me mention about the unruly Joes supporters, to indicate how they “Supported” their college players with their “delaying tactics”
(a) These “Time Consuming” incidents that I mentioned was during the Peterite run chase. Prior to this, during the Joes second innings when they were fighting for survival at the fall of each Josephian wicket and each time when their hero batsmen scored a boundary (at the last stages of his great innings) this unruly Joes supporters invaded the ground.
(b) There was an incident during the last stages of the Peterite run chase when these hooligan supporters ran to the wickets they poured some liquid (should be alcohol) on the danger area of the wicket. When the umpires wanted to repair it the Peterite batsmen wanted to continue their task without wasting any more time.
(c) With all these antics of the unruly Joes supporters light was fading. As per the agreed playing conditions it permits to continue the 15 mandatory overs till 6.15 p.m. Except for the two overs bowled by a spinner (one of the opening bowlers} rest of the 7.2 overs were bowled by the fast bowlers.
When the match ended finally the stumps were taken away by the unruly Joes supporters the ONLY WAY and the ONLY PERSON who could prevail justice and fair play was none other than the Head of that leading Catholic educational Institute that existed over a century producing some of the finest gentlemen and sportsmen in this country. Rev. Fr. Travis Gabriel not only gave the much deserved victory to the Peterites, he also safe guarded the respect that both colleges and the general public have towards the late Rev. Fr. Maurice Le Goc (a great Rector of SJC and founder of SPC) under whose name a trophy is presented to the winners of this match. It was presented to the Peterites by Mr. Chithampalam Gardiner.
When I think over of this noble decision taken by the Rector of SJC, my memory goes back to the year 1971 when a Royal and Trinity rugby match was played NOT for that famous “Bradby Shield”, just only one leg (due to the youth up rise in the South - 1971 April insurgency). Then Trinity College, Kandy principal late Mr. Lionel Fernando decided to award the prestigious shield to Royal College. (These two episodes may not be the same but the net result was same). It is great to have in this era too the calibre of SJC Rector when most of the values are decaying day by day in this society.
LESSONS THAT SHOULD BE LEARNT FROM THIS INCIDENT
1) This Big Match encounter should be played at a venue where the crowd control is an easy task. (Ex: Joe-Pete Limited over encounter played at the R. Premadasa Stadium). No wonder with these kinds of incidents genuine spectators keep away from this annual event despite it being played for over 80 years)
2) On every match ticket it should be printed that any spectator with unruly behavior, invading grounds and damaging property will be removed from the stadium by the Security Staff.
At the very inception of an incident this action should be taken. (It can be mentioned in the souvenir too under playing conditions.) During the match at regular intervals these conditions should be announced through the “Public System”.
3) With all these precautions if similar incident/s takes place in the future, rectors of the respective colleges should address through the “Public System” at the early stages to caution the unruly supporters or to unsporty players that the match will be awarded to the side that is facing injustice due to the acts.
4) It is of NO USE having JOINT COMMITTEES, JOINT LOGOS, T-Shirts etc. if these officials cannot bring such situations under control.
Let us hope sanity will prevail between these two leading Educational Institutions in the island and I pray going forward old boys, school authorities and players will take necessary action to avoid tarnishing the good name of these two colleges.
Three Cheers to Rector of St. Joseph’s College.
