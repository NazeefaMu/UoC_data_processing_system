From building to re-assembling

Drawing to the end of Rotaract year 2016/2017, the cycle continues in passing on the torch of leadership to those of the same built leadership calibre as those of their predecessors, bringing with them new visions for the future. In the same manner, Rtr IPP Anfal Nilar of Rotaract Club of Wattala for the years 2016/2017, lead the club under the vision, “Building the blocks of Leadership” and successfully handed over the reins of the club’s leadership to Rtr. Nabil Shafaz on the 02nd of July 2017 for the years 2017/2018 under the vision, “Re-assembling dedicated masses”.
On receiving this official post, Rtr. Nabil Shafaz first conveyed his heartfelt gratitude towards Rtr. IPP. Anfal Nilar and his team for encouraging Rotaract Club of Wattala to greater heights and Rtr. Aneez Anver, for reviving and building a strong foundation on which the club now stands proudly.
Furthermore, Rtr. Nabil mentioned that he is extremely honoured to be elected as President of the club on the same year Rotaract in Sri Lanka celebrates 50 years and that he will do his very best in leading the club to its continuous success. He explained that his vision for the year aims to bring a variety of people together. His goal is to search, encourage and empower young talent, bringing them out to the spotlight, thus reassembling them where they need to be.
