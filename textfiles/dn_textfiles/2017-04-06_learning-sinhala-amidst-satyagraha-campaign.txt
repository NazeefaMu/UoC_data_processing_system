Learning Sinhala amidst Satyagraha campaign

Completing the 44th day of the Satyagraha and not receiving any favourable response from the government, the Batticaloa District Unemployed Graduates have begun learning Sinhala yesterday. The President of the Campaign Association of Unemployed Graduates in Sri Lanka (CAUG) Ven. Thenne Gnananantha Thero is teaching them Sinhala under a tree close to Gandhi Park, Batticaloa.
