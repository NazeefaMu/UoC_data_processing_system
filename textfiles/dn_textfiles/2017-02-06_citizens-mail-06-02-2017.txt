Teacher’s disgrace
It is disheartening to voice via the multi media that some teachers have resorted to corporal punishment in schools in spite of its ban by law. Then how can these emotionally excited pedagogues take the law into their hands after having studied educational psychology before entering the noble profession of teaching the younger generation?
Recently, some teachers have been reported to have used broomsticks to punish their students for some mistakes the latter have committed unintentionally. Then, when the students’ parents took up this case in the courts, the judge punished the particular teachers by imposing upon them payment of compensation to the injured students while serving imprisonment for a fixed period.
What a disgrace to the teachers’ community! The noble character of teaching service is utterly lost in public. The parents are compelled to lose trust and confidence on the teachers in general.
Then can we entrust our young children to these arrogant teachers for gradual development of character linked with education? May I draw the earnest attention of Education Minister and the Department of Education to the criteria of an ideal teacher just before appointment. Besides, the education planners and inspectors of schools should inspect the teaching tasks of these teachers at least once a month and should assess the teachers performance in relation to students and the condition of discipline observed by both teachers and students.
In cases of misbehaviour, the principal and inspectors should submit reports about this matter to higher authorities in education for deterrent punishment without getting involved in police arrest and courts action.
Therefore, I am making a special appeal to the teachers who deviate from the ethics of teaching service to maintain their noble character in the best interest of the younger generation engaged in education.
