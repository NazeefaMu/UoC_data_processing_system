Most skips in 24 hours

A Japanese jump rope enthusiast broke a Guinness world record for most skips over a rope in 24 hours when he hit a total of 151,409 skips.
Hijiki Ikuyama, 36, who has previously broken numerous rope-skipping world records, alternated between using a larger rope held by assistants and using his own smaller rope when he spent 24 hours working to beat Isabel Bush's record of 151,036 skips.
"It was so tough I had to take 10-minute breaks every 20 minutes," Ikuyama said.
"The guidelines allowed me to skip a large rope spun by assistants so the plan was to alternate between a large rope and short rope. But for the long rope, we didn't practice together beforehand, and we couldn't synchronize properly so I kept on trapping the rope and losing time," he said.
"Eight hours before the end of the attempt, I ditched the large rope and skipped solo -- I thought I have to go and push the limit," Ikuyama said.
He finished with a total 151,409 skips, enough to take the record. Ikuyama said his interest in the sport began at a young age.
"I had a crush on my teacher, and I was thinking of ways to get some attention from her. Because she was pretty good at rope skipping, I thought mastering that would impress her," he said.
