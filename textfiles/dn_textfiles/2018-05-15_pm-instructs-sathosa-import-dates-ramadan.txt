PM instructs Sathosa to import dates for Ramadan

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had instructed Sathosa to import sufficient supplies of dates for the upcoming month of Ramadan.
He advised thus on the request of Muslim Religious Affairs Minister M. H. A. Haleem and National Unity and Reconciliation Minister A. H. M. Fowzie.
Dates are distributed to Muslims during Ramdan through Mosques. This year, steps had been taken to distribute 150 metric tonnes of dates donated by Saudi Arabia. In addition, Sathosa too had been requested to import another 150 metric tonnes of dates to be distributed among the public.
The request was made due to the decline in date supplies from the Middle East as their harvests had been dwindling as of recent times. Further, private retailers such as Cargills too, had been requested the same by the Prime Minister.
