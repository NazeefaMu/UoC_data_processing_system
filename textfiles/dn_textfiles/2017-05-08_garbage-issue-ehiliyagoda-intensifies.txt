Garbage issue in Ehiliyagoda intensifies

The Plumbego Mine in the ‘Akkarapanaha’ land under the Beruwana Estate where the Eheliyagoda Pradeshiya Sabha was dumping garbage collected in the town has now overflown. Therefore, the Eheliyagoda Pradeshiya Sabha has no location to dispose of its daily garbage at present, sources said.
Garbage in the town was dumped to the mine until 2016, Eheliyagoda PS Secretary, Jagath Gunatilake said.
He said the quantity of garbage collected daily by the PS from the Eheliyagoda town and suburbs is on the rise. Therefore, the Pradeshiya Sabha is in dire need of a new location to dispose of its daily garbage, he said.
