B-town nuptials

Bollywood stars Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone have revealed more photos from their wedding, reception and post wedding party. The duo were married in Lake Como, Italy just a few days ago, and are already back home in India.
The beloved couple, who have appeared in four films together, had a strict no-photos policy at their wedding. They didn't seem to try and sell photos either, but have instead shared snaps from the big day themselves on social media, for free. Internet
