'Formulate strategies now to make SLFP victorious in future'

 
As members of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), what we should do today is take the party forward, without trying to protest and go behind individuals, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said.
Addressing a 'jana hamuwa' in Anuradhapura on January 24, Minister de Silva said that individuals may come and individuals may go, but the party must continue forever.
Minister Silva said the breaking up of political parties is a common feature in Sri Lankan politics: "The same thing is being attempted today. But we should not allow anyone to break up the SLFP," he said, explaining that while a conflict of ideas and tension could be seen within the party, conflicting ideas could be witnessed within the government too, because it was a coalition of two parties; "we should try to iron them out and reach a consensus within," he said.
Minister de Silva said therefore, awareness should be made among grassroot level supporters of the SLFP, to have them know that the party did not promote a single individual and his or her ego, and so, they should steadfastly unite under a single banner, without focusing on individuals.
"We should formulate strategies from now on to make the SLFP victorious at future elections. We should march forward according to the principles and the programme of the party," he said.
