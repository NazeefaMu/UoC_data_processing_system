‘Ruff’ salesman

Paws down, car buying can be ruff. Fortunately, there’s a pint-sized car dealer who’s eager to help.
Introducing Brus Griffin, an adorable Brussels Griffon who you know you can trust because she’s wearing a suit and tie.
The tiny dog, whose real name is Gilda, is the star of a hit YouTube video that shows her peddling cars for the imaginary Brus Griffin’s Motor World.
“Our prices are dangerously low because I can’t read!” Brus Griffin boasts while posing in a used car lot. “Should a dog be selling cars? Probably not. Come get yours today before the government catches wind of this and shuts us down!
Brus’ owner, a woman named Steph who also has a second Brussels Griffon named Griff, told HuffPost that inspiration for the commercial filmed last week came after she purchased the child-sized suit for her little breadwinner from a thrift store.
“I buy them outfits sometimes because it’s hilarious and great for the pictures,” she said by email on Wednesday. “It was only $4 and had already paid for itself in laughs before I even got home.”
After putting the suit on the pooch - which Steph said her dog “actually really liked” - she said she couldn’t shake off her dog’s resemblance to a car salesman. As for the name, Brus Griffin, she called it “just the slimy car salesman name I used.”
Of course, because they say it’s the suit that makes the man, other videos posted on Instagram show Gilda posing as a serious, chair-swiveling attorney, with the “Law and Order” theme song playing in the background.
“Have you been a bad dog? Injured while fetching?” the video’s captions asks. “Call Brus Griffin of Griffin & Griffin Law.”
Another photo shows her in a side-by-side comparison to paper salesman Dwight Schrute from “The Office” and then again in a sales meeting for - what else? - tennis balls, compliments of Reddit’s Photoshop Battles.
