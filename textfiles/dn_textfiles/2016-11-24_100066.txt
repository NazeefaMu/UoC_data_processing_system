Four Brandix teams in Mercantile Volleyball finals

 
Inspired performances by teams from companies in the Brandix Group have resulted in Sri Lanka’s top apparel exporter sending four teams to the six finals of the Mercantile Volleyball Association which are to be played on November 25 and 27.
Reiterating their dominance in the preliminary rounds of the 2016 tournament, these teams will represent Brandix at the Men’s and Women’s Super League finals, the Men’s Championship, and the Men’s A Division final.
Two other Brandix teams won third places in the Women’s Super League and in the A Division during the semi-finals, reflecting the Group’s extensive engagement with the sport.
The Brandix teams vying for Mercantile Volleyball’s highest honours at the 2016 finals are Brandix Fast Fashion – Minuwangoda (Men’s Super League), Brandix Green Plant – Seeduwa (Women’s Super League), Brandix Athleisure – Polonnaruwa (Men’s Championship) and Brandix Athleisure – Katunayake (Men’s A Division).
Teams from Brandix placed third in their respective tournaments were Brandix Fast Fashion 2 – Mirigama (Women’s Super League) and Brandix Fast Fashion – Avissawella (Women’s A Division).
In all, 88 teams representing mercantile sector entities competed in the preliminary rounds of this year’s tournament.
Sri Lanka’s Exporter of the Year since 2012 and the highest employment provider in the country’s export industry, Brandix conducts its own annual volleyball tournament for the ‘Rasadiya Kusalanaya’ (Mercury Trophy), which is considered the largest volleyball tournament organised by a private company in the country.
