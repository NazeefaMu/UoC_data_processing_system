Jesus came to heal the world

Christmas commemorates the birth of Jesus Christ many years ago. It was a beginning which will have no end. When the clock chimes at the beginning of December 25, Christians throughout the world rejoice. Churches are packed. From midnight mass till late in the evening Christians visit their respective places of worship to say “Happy Birthday” to their redeemer.
It could be wonderful to walk down with time, when a divine message is brought to a simple Jewish girl. Be it done to me according to your word she says, bowing her head, little realizing as to how many times she would utter these words. Yet she is worried. She was to wed a handsome wood craftsman. Young Joseph consoles her. He too had been visited by the same Messenger. They, then prepare to welcome Baby Jesus into this world.
Born in a simple shed, in an alien land, with a gentle carpenter of repute in attendance as a midwife, a couple of quadrupeds to give warmth Jesus Christ, the Redeemer of the world and Saviour was born. Visited by the shepherds and regal wise men, His mother was elated. He was the Messiah or the Promised One as said in the Old Testament. He was not an intellectual. He was born to sacrifice His life for the first sin man committed. There is no “Greater Love” Jesus said “Than for a man to give his life for his friend.” He gave his life for us. His teachings were loathed by the elite, scribes and the Pharisees. He angered them. He disagreed with their eye for an eye, tooth for tooth policy.
He humiliated them when people brought a woman in sin. Yes! The punishment in those days was stoning her to death. “He that is without sin, let him cast the first stone” Jesus said. Later, he found only the accused woman with him. Others had quietly walked away. When Pharisees accused His disciples of breaking the Sabbath, He had asked “Which one of you will not rescue a sheep that had fallen into a well on the Sabbath.” He called them the offspring of vipers, and wolves in sheep’s clothing. He showed his humility by washing the feet of his disciples and when he moved with, and ate with persons whom the elite classed as the downtrodden in society.
Jesus chased vendors out of the temple. “Do not make my Father’s House a den of thieves,” He said. Sadly, it happens at many places of religious worship even now. Again He said “which one of you will give your servant to eat before you eat?” It was on the dignity of labour. He spoke on child abuse “Should a child be scandalized, the person should be pushed into an abyss with a stone round his neck.”
That was Jesus Christ, our Redeemer. He lived for thirty three years. Preached for three years and strived to heal the world by his teaching, parables and deeds. He showed forgiveness and neighbourly love. Then, after a mockery of a trial, He trekked up Calvary carrying a heavy piece of timber to die for us and to shed his blood.
On this beautiful day, let us pray for amity, tolerance, togetherness and love in our own Motherland and around the globe.
