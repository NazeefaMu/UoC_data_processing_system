Every child has a right to be heard

Sri Lanka has all the necessary vital statistics to be a child-friendly country: high literacy rate, high life expectancy, educated population, good infrastructure, low population growth, excellent geography and location.
World Bank has given us “middle-income country” status with GDP Per Capita (nominal) of $ 3870.00. The Bank has also forecasted accelerated economic growth in the next three years on the back of the proposed reform programme.
United Nations categorized us as “High Human development” country. In UN’s latest Human Development Index, we are ranked 73. On top of all, we have literacy rate of 93%.
All these figures are well above our regional peers.
So, at first glance, Sri Lanka is an ideal place in South Asia to raise a child. However, this picture is not as close to perfection as one might believe. Certain things still escape Sri Lanka in terms of its children’s rights, particularly, child labour, education, and juvenile justice.
Look at these figures. Over 9,000 instances of violence involving children were reported to the National Child Protection Authority in 2016. Studies highlighted that 40 percent of parents surveyed in the Colombo district admitted physically abusing their child, 14 percent of adolescent girls and boys surveyed had experienced some form of sexual abuse and 31 percent of adolescent boys and 25 percent of adolescent girls surveyed had experienced emotional abuse. These are disturbing facts.
Poverty
It is a fact that the majority of our children and youth are in school or are enrolled in formal training. Yet, some do not have this opportunity and must work to help support their families. On the brighter side, we have witnessed that, during the last two decades, there has been an increase in income for most of the citizens resulting a rapid decline of children who need to work. Still the problem is not fully eradicated. A recent report indicated that out-of-schoolchildren amounts to around 2 per cent. However, lower-secondary-school-age (10-13 years) children face greater a risk of dropping out (5.1%).
This study found the reasons are most commonly linked to income, poverty, inadequacies in the supply of schools and teachers, deficiencies in the teaching - learning process, conflict and disasters caused by natural hazards, lack of political commitment and politicization of the system etc. Of the problem of out-of-schoolchildren is to be solved. These inadequacies had to be sorted out.
In accordance with provisions of Young Persons and Children’s Act, a child is a person under the age of 14 years and the Act prohibits employment of children. The Department of Labour receives over two hundred complaints of child labour every month.
The majority of the boys engaged in child labour are from rural areas working as agricultural and low-technology sector workers while the girls are mostly used as domestic aides in urban areas.
As the study has pointed out, poverty has a significant impact on the lives of children who often have poor health and are less likely to have access to higher education. The Government must look into this issue on a priority basis.
Health
Sri Lanka is having a free and universal healthcare system. It scores higher than the regional average in healthcare having a high life expectancy and a lower maternal and infant deaths. It is known for having one of the world’s earliest known healthcare systems and has its own indigenous medicine system.
Family Health Bureau (FHB) is the focal point for Maternal and Child Health (MCH) in Sri Lanka. The system had been well developed and effective in delivering preventive and promotive maternal and child health services to the population and had been highly spoken of as a model for other developing countries.
Education
Sri Lanka’s education system is considered as one of the best in the region. In fact, the education facilities in Sri Lanka have improved dramatically since independence. School education in Sri Lanka is compulsory to age 14 of which the first 5 years are spent in primary school. At the end of this there is an optional scholarship examination that may permit access to a superior grade of school.
The State provides a number of vocational and technical training centres, and programes for apprenticeship training too. These take place within a system of seven levels of qualifications, of which the upper one is rated equivalent to State degree level. There are also a variety of tertiary academic institutions where programes may be followed that range from one-year certificates through to doctorates.
Grey areas
However, this near image of perfection in the education sector hides some grey areas that are related to discipline, to discrimination, and the right of self-expression.
Sri Lanka expressed its commitment to prohibiting all corporal punishment of children, including in the home, at the July 2006 meeting of the South Asia Forum, following the 2005 regional consultation of the UN Study on Violence against Children. By now, 51 countries have banned corporal punishment. UN Committee on the Rights of the Child calls physical punishment, however slight, “invariably degrading.” It does more harm than good. In Sri Lanka, however, prohibition is still be achieved.
The second grey point- discrimination – also need to be studied. Unfortunately, some forms of discrimination still persist, especially children with disabilities or special needs. Data on children with disabilities are very limited and difficult to access but it is an obvious fact these children experience widespread violations of their rights. A very small percentage of all handicapped children begin school yet, and of them, majority drop out due to unpleasant experiences.
A survey in 2012 indicated that there were 88,740 mentally and physically handicapped children between the ages of 5 -19 years, of which 62% were receiving education through mainstream schooling, and 34% had not received any form of education. These statistics indicated that the handicapped children with multiple and intellectual disabilities abstain from attending schools. This was because public and private provision of education lacks expertise and capacity to deal with such children.
If we are talking about “Inclusive Education”, then we should recognize every child’s fundamental right to learn. The education system should provide equal opportunities to all children and attempt to alter school culture, policies and practices to accommodate differences in learning and physical abilities of children. This matter also needs the attention of the Government.
Another grey area is the right of children to express their opinions. We have excluded children from participation in matters that affect them. Ask any parent or teacher. The answers are consistent. Children lack competence; they lack knowledge and judgement; involving them in decisions is to place too heavy a burden on them; parents and teachers know what is best for their children; giving children a voice will lead to excessive demands, bad behaviour, disrespect for elders; participation will expose children to risk of harm.
However, time and again, experience shows that children – even very young children – given the time and opportunity, demonstrate not only that they have views, experiences and perspectives to express, but that their expression can contribute positively to decisions that affect the realisation of their rights and well-being.
We use “discipline”, which does not encourage children to express their own ideas but rather reinforces their feeling of being constantly bullied.
NPEVAC
So, where do we take it from here. Minister of Women and Child Affairs recently said that the Government has decided to introduce a new policy document on child care, child protection and child alternative care, to support necessary amendments to the Children (Judicial Protection) Bill.
“We have proposed to include a bill of rights in the Constitution with a special clause to include child rights and protection,” she said at the launch of the National Partnership to End Violence against Children (NPEVAC).
NPEVAC, a new initiative to end violence against children by 2030 is a collaborative partnership between the Government, UN agencies, international organisations, civil society, faith groups, the private sector, the media, children and other key stakeholders. This partnership to end violence against children creates a vital window of opportunity for Sri Lanka to discuss challenges and exchange knowledge. This is a commendable move.
If this partnership is going to be a success, it must develop a multi-disciplinary, multi-agency and multi-pronged approach. This approach should include child centric policies and practices in all matters pertaining to children, emphasis on training and development of all professionals working with children, inter-agency collaboration and a strong partnership with parents and the public.
Let us hope the NPEVAC partnership will understand that children are human beings and are the subject of their own rights. First of all, the Partnership must offer a vision of the child as an individual and as a member of a family and community, with rights and responsibilities appropriate to his or her age and stage of development. By recognizing children’s rights in this way, the Partnership can firmly set the focus on the whole child.
