Sri Lanka’s leading tyre brand CEAT has further consolidated its engagement with motor racing in the country by taking title sponsorship of the ‘CEAT Sri Lanka Super Series’ comprising of four race meets to be conducted in 2016 by the Sri Lanka Association of Racing Drivers and Riders (SLARDAR) one of two associations representing drivers and riders.
The four race meets are the Cavalry Supercross (June 11 and 12), the Pannala Circuit Meet I (July 29 to31 ), the Commando Challenge (October 8 and 9) and the Pannala Circuit Meet II (November 12 and 13). The Commando Challenge will be conducted at a newly-constructed supercross track at the Commando Regiment Training School at Uwa Kudaoya.
With the formalisation of CEAT’s support to these events, the brand becomes the title sponsor of the two main championships in Sri Lanka for motorsports, the CEAT Sri Lanka Super Series and the CEAT SLADA Championship comprising of another five race meets.
This is the third successive year that CEAT is supporting the CEAT Sri Lanka Super Series and the seventh year of sponsorship of the CEAT SLARDAR/CEAT SLADA Championship.
