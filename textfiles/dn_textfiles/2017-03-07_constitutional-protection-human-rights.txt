Constitutional protection of human rights

An important judgement in the field of education was delivered by the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka in 2007. In the absence of the right to education as a fundamental right in our present Constitution, the Supreme Court applied the fundamental right to equality (Article 12 of the Constitution) as discussed above to prove the infringement of the child’s right to education by the education authorities of the State. The petitioners in this case alleged infringements of their fundamental rights guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the 1978 Constitution
Equality is a new frontier of judicial activism in Sri Lanka. The guarantees of equality provided by Article 12 of the Sri Lankan Constitution of 1978 to a considerable extent, resemble corresponding provisions in the Indian Constitution (Articles 14 and 15). The early phase of jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka relating to equality revolved the traditional doctrine of reasonable classification mainly developed by the US Supreme Court. The Palihawadana judgement (1979) marks a dismal beginning for fundamental rights jurisprudence of the Sri Lankan Supreme Court. By embracing the new doctrine on equality evolved by the Indian Supreme Court, the Sri Lankan Supreme Court infused a new dimension to the guarantee of equal protection of the law by pronouncing that it embraces the right to public administrative justice-to be free from a caprice of arbitrary executive or administrative action.
In India, a new orientation has been given to Article 14 of the Indian Constitution (which corresponds to our Artcle 12) by the Supreme Court of India, The Supreme Court of India for the first time laid down in Royappa’s case in 1974 ‘a new dimension’ of Article 14. It was Justice Bhagawathi who first propounded this new doctrine. The claim was repeated in Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India (1978); Ramana v. International Airport Authority of India (1979); Ajay Hasia v. Khalid Mujib (1981). In Hasia’s case the claim was formulated thus;
“Equality is a dynamic concept with many aspects and dimensions and it cannot be cribbed, cabined & confined within traditional and doctrinaire limits. From a positivistic point of view, equality is antithetic to arbitrariness”
Article 12 of the 1978 Constitution of Sri Lanka allows a reasonable classification. The grounds referred to in Article12 (2) cannot be valid basis of classification. The Article specifically bars the State from discriminating against any citizen on any of those grounds. Article 12 (1) offers equality to all persons in which the right to equality is generally stated. On the other hand, Article 12 (2) is applicable to citizens only and therefore it is an instance and particular application of the right of equality which is generally stated in Article12 (1). If discrimination is alleged on a ground other than those specified in Article 12 (2), the case must be decided under the general Article 12 (1).
Article 12 (2) specifies the institutionalised grounds on which discrimination against any citizen is prohibited, including race, religion, language caste, sex , political opinion, place of birth or any one of such grounds. Article 12(3) prohibits discrimination in the form of any disability, liability, restriction or condition with regard to access to shops, public restaurants, hotels, places of public entertainment, and places of public worship of a person’s own religion. Finally Article 12(4) permits ‘special provision being made by law, subordinate legislation or executive action, for the advancement of women, children or disabled person’.
Scope of the Right to Education in the Sri Lankan Constitution
Chapter III of the 1978 Constitution lists out a number of fundamental rights including right to equality freedom of speech, and freedom from torture and so on. But not a word about education.
By Article 27(2) (h) of the 1978 Constitution under Chapter VI – Directive Principles of State Policy ( DPSP) the State is pledged to “the complete eradication of illiteracy and the assurance to all persons of the right to universal and equal access to education at all levels”, but free education is not stipulated; not the right to non-State education. The content and quality of education is not stipulated, but Article 27(13) calls upon the State to ensure the “full development” of children and youth, and that must include education in its widest sense and of reasonable quality. However, Article 29 of 1978 Constitution provides that these DPSP do not create legal rights or obligations and are not enforceable in any court or tribunal, and that no question of inconsistency shall be raised in any court or tribunal. It follows from the above that the right to education is not a fundamental right justiciable under our present Constitution.
The Case Law from Sri Lanka
q R Haputhantrige & Others v. Secretary, Ministry of Education & Others (2007 FR) 10-13/2007 (Grade One Admission case) (2007) 1 Sri LR 101.
An important judgment in the field of education was delivered by the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka in 2007. In the absence of the right to education as a fundamental right in our present Constitution, the Supreme Court applied the fundamental right to equality (Article 12 of the Constitution) as discussed above to prove the infringement of the child’s right to education by the education authorities of the State. The petitioners in this case alleged infringements of their fundamental rights guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the 1978 Constitution.
The alleged infringements were in respect of the refusal to admit the several children named in the petitions to Grade I of respective National Schools. The allegations have related to unequal, arbitrary and capricious application of the relevant circulars resulting in less suited children securing admission to the detriment of the children who have been thereby compelled to invoke the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.
The underlying cause of this pervasive malady is the ever increasing demand for admission to the leading schools in Colombo and other principal cities administratively designated as National Schools within the purview of the Central Government. The response of the authorities to this classic situation of a gross mismatch in supply and demand has been to narrow down, through an intricate system of criteria contained in circulars, the area that would feed a particular school described in the circular as the ‘feeder area’ of the school.
The petitioners made applications for the admission of their respective children to the Sujatha Vidyalaya, Matara on the basis of Circular No. 20 of 2006 dated 23.05.2006 issued by the 10th Respondent, being the Secretary of Ministry of Education, titled ‘Admission of Children to Schools’. Petitioners admittedly reside within close proximity of the Sujatha Vidyalaya and their common complaint was that on the elaborate system of assigning marks they in fact received sufficient marks to secure admission of their children.
However, 30 other children, residing further away secured admission depriving Petitioners’ children of their due places in view of a decision of the Respondents to assign 15 marks to each child who was born at the Matara Hospital. As a result Petitioners’ children fell below the cut off point giving an undue advantage to children who were born in the Matara hospital.
The Supreme Court having reviewed the Circular in question found that the classification in the Circular was not based on the suitability and the need of a particular child to receive education in a national school or any other State school.
The classification was based on according to the Court wholly extraneous considerations such as the residence of the parents to be ascertained from the ownership of the property, whether the parent is a past pupil and if so for what period and his achievements, whether the child to be admitted has a brother or sister in the school and if so brother’s or sister’s achievements or whether the parent has been transferred in the manner referred to therein. The suitability and the need of the particular student to receive education in the school is not ascertained in the process, no is there any method and criteria specified to ascertain such matters. The Court also noted that the system of weighted marking as contained in the Circular completely defects the objective of providing equal access to education.
The Supreme Court examined the grounds urged from the ambit of the fundamental right to equality guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the 1978 Constitution. According the Court the Preamble of the Constitution states the ‘immutable republican principles’ on which it is based as being ‘Representative Democracy’ and the assurance to all people ‘Freedom, Equality, Justice, Fundamental Human Rights and the Independence of the Judiciary’. These principles partake of Democracy and Socialism being the components of the name of the Republic.
As noted by the Supreme Court, the law in its primary sense of an Ordinance or Enactment of the legislature related to Education is contained in the Education Ordinance originally proclaimed in 1939, prior to the granting of independence. According to the Supreme Court a perusal of the provisions of the Ordinance reveals that these provisions have mostly fallen into disuse.
A similar observation was made by the Court as regards the exhaustive regulations that have been made under the Ordinance. Here the regulations refer to those in operation at the time of the judgment. The Education Ordinance established the Department of the Education as the central authority for education which function under the general direction and control of the Minister.
As noted by the Supreme Court in the judgement, the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, inter alia provides for the devolution of power to Provincial Councils. In terms of section 3 of List 1 in the 9th Schedule to the 13th Amendment, ‘Education and Educational Services’ to the extent set out in Appendix III are devolved to Provincial Councils.
Right to equality
Section 1 of Appendix 111 states that the provision of facilities to all State schools other than specified schools shall be the responsibility of the Provincial Council. It is therefore provided that specified schools will be ‘National Schools’.
The concept of national schools derives solely from its single reference to it in Appendix III. Almost all leading government schools have been declared as being ‘National Schools’. According to the Supreme Court, the Education Ordinance has not been amended to provide for the newly emerged situation and there is no specific law that is operative as regards National Schools or for that matter.
The Supreme Court examined the content of the right to equality in order to form a basis to judge the alleged infringement in this case. Accordingly, the Supreme Court referred to Dr. Wickremaratne (Fundamental Rights in Sri Lanka – 2006 2nd Ed. at p 286) citing from the renowned exponent of Socialism, Harold Laski (A Grammer of Politics), Justice C.G Weeramantry and the Judgment of Brewer J., sums up the concept of equality and the manner in which the equal protection of law applies, as follows:
‘Equality, as Laski stated, does not mean identity of treatment. There can be no ultimate identity of treatment so long as men are different in want and capacity and need. Men are unequal in strength, talent and other attributes. While some of these are natural, others are referable to the society in which they live. Some are born with advantages. Other factors and combinations of factors may favour some people and place others at a disadvantage. To quote Weeramantry:
As the myriads of constituent units of a society keep thus shifting their positions relative to each other, absolute equality among (men) even in one characteristic of for a moment of time is patently an impossibility. Far greater is the impossibility of preserving general equality for any period, however short.
A permanent state of equality is only the remotest dream.’
Equal protection does not mean that all persons are to be treated alike in all circumstances. It means that persons who are similarly circumstanced must be similarly treated. The State is however permitted to make laws that are unequal and to take unequal administrative action when dealing with persons who are placed in different circumstances and situations.
Thus the State has the right to classify persons and place those who are substantially similar under the same rule of law while applying different rules to persons differently situated. A classification should not be irrational or arbitrary. It must be reasonable and based on some real and substantial distinction, which bears a reasonable and just relation to the act in respect of which the classification is proposed can never be made arbitrary and without any such basis.’
The Supreme Court also stated that the requirement stated by Brewer J., in the case of Gulf Colarado and Santa Railway Co. v Ethis has been subsequently stated as the ‘Basic standard’ to be satisfied in a permissible classification. The Supreme Court applied the classic formulation of the basic standard stated in the case Royster Guano Co. v. Commonwealth of Virginia (1920) at page 415. It reads as follows:
Classification must be reasonable not arbitrary and must rest upon some ground of differences having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation, so that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike.
The Supreme Court stated that the broad phrase ‘National Policy’ appearing at the top List 11 should be interpreted with the relevant provisions in Chapter VI of the 1978 Constitution which contains the ‘Directive Principles of State Policy’. The limitation in Article 29 which states that the provisions of Chapter VI are not justiciable would not in the view of the Court be a bar against the use of these provisions to interpret other provisions of the Constitution. Article 27 of Chapter VI lays down that the ‘Directive Principles of State Policy’ contained therein shall guide ‘Parliament, the President and the Cabinet of Ministers in the enactment of the laws and the governance of Sri Lanka for the establishment of a just and free society’.
As regards education, the policy objective as referred to by the Court is stated in Article 27(2) (h) of the Chapter VI of the 1978 Constitution which is not justiciable under Article 29 of the 1978 Constitution as follows:
‘The State is pledged to establish in Sri Lanka a democratic socialist society, the objective of which include - …… (h) the complete eradication of literacy and the assurance to all persons of the right to universal and equal access to education at all levels’.
The Supreme Court also stated that equal opportunity in the matter of education was held by the Supreme Court of the United States to be requirement of the Equal Protection Clause (Similar to Article 12 of our Constitution) of the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution. The Supreme Court also referred to the judgment, Brown v Board of Education Topika where the Chief Justice Warren delivering the opinion of the Court stated as follows:
‘Today, education is perhaps the most important function of the State and the local governments. Compulsory school attendance laws and the great expenditures for education both demonstrate our recognition of the importance of education to our democratic society. It is required in the performance of our most basic responsibilities, even service in the armed forces. It is the very foundation of good citizenship. Today it is a principle instrument in awakening the child to cultural values in preparing him for later professional training and in helping him to adjust normally to his environment. In these days, it is doubtful that any child may reasonably be expected succeed in life if he is denied the opportunity of an education. Such an opportunity where the State has undertaken to provide it, is a right which must be right made available to all on equal terms.
Access to education
The Supreme Court stated that the classification in the Circular in question is not based on the suitability and the need of a particular child to receive education in a National School or any other State school. The classification underlying the Circular in question is based on wholly extraneous considerations. Similarly the system of weighted marking referred to as contained in the Circular completely defeats the objective of providing equal access to education. Therefore the Supreme Court held that the Circular in question applicable in the matter of admission of students is inconsistent with the fundamental right to equality before the law and the equal protection of the law guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the 1978 Constitution, in so far as it relates to the admission of students to Grade I of National Schools and other schools to which the Circular has been made applicable.
As noted by the Supreme Court the authorities have failed over the decades that elapsed to provide an effective legal machinery to manage, regulate and supervise education. The Ministry of Education appeared to have formulated the Circular as the purported national policy outside the framework of the law, which fact by itself would suffice to declare invalid. Section 2 of the National Education Commission Act No.19 of 1991 empowers the President to declare from time to time the national education policy which shall be conformed to by all authorities and institutions responsible for education in all its aspects. The policy is formulated on the recommendations and advice of the Commission and in terms of section 2(2) includes, inter alia: “ ……. Methods and criteria for admission of students’.
In the view of the Supreme Court, this is the proper guideline for the formulation of a policy. The Ministry fell into error by laying down classifications, quotas and a system of weighted marking being elements completely antithetic to the guarantee of equality before the law whereas the focus should be on appropriate methods and criteria that would apply in the process of effecting admissions.
In the situation that has arisen, the Supreme Court was of the view that it is appropriate for immediate action to be taken in terms of the National Education Commission Act for the formulation of a policy setting out methods and criteria for admission of students. Therefore the Supreme Court decided that the existing situation has resulted in a gross abuse of the process of admission of students. In the circumstances it would be necessary to device a new process in which the participation of authorities who have brought about the tragic situation be excluded and the process to be administered directly under the purview of the President as provided in the National Education Commission Act.
 Therefore, the Supreme Court held that;
(1) The national policy of school admission to be formulated may be submitted to the Court for the policy to be examined from the perspective of the fundamental right to equality before the law and the equal protection of the law guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the 1978 Constitution.
(2) S.C applications 10 to 13 – 2007 are allowed and the petitioners are granted the Declaration that their fundamental rights guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the Constitution have been infringed by executive and administrative action.
(3) It is further declared that the Circular in question is inconsistent with Article 12(1) of the Constitution and is invalid and of no force or avail in law in respect of admission of students to Grade I in the schools to which the Circular is addressed.
• Seneviratne v. University Grants Commission, (1978-80)
Seneviratne v University Grants Commission concerned admission to universities. In this case the scheme of admission to the Universities provided for 55% of the places available to be distributed on the basis of the ratio of population among the 24 administrative districts; 15% of the places were to be apportioned at the discretion of the University Grants Commission among 13 districts which were considered to be underprivileged and 30% of the places were to be decided solely on merit. The challenge was directed to the said allocation of the 55%. The petitioner relied on the judgment of the Supreme Court of India in Rajendran v. State of Madras, (1968) S.C. 1012. In that case, the Supreme Court of India struck down a rule which laid down district wise distribution of seats in the State Medical College on the basis of the ratio of the population of each district to the total population of the State. It was pointed out that there was no nexus between such distribution and the object to be achieved viz. admission of best talent among the candidates. Fixation of district-wise quota on the ratio of the district population to the total state population for admission to the State Medical College is discriminatory.
Basically any district quota is discriminatory, for quota means that as between two candidates of equal merits coming from two different districts the candidate belonging to one district is preferred to the other, just because he comes from the wrong district whose quota is filled up. Deserving candidates will be frustrated by reservation for the less deserving persons. The test applied to adjudge the validity of any reservation is whether it is based on any rational and relevant principle.
The respondent University Grants Commission submitted to Court that by reason of the educational-socio-economic circumstances of Sri Lanka and the unequal secondary educational facilities provided mainly by the government, the determination of entry to the Universities based solely on the aggregate of raw marks of a candidate cannot be accepted as the sole criterion for higher education.
Wanasundera, J. upholding the classification stated that “the increasing number of students pressing for admission and the woeful lack of teachers and facilities in most of the provinces had compelled the authorities to modify the merit principle to meet the ends of justice. The departure from the merit principle, though unfortunate, is inevitable. He referred to, with approval, Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala and State of Kerala v Thomas where the Indian Supreme Court had given the Directive Principles a place of honor in the Constitution-they “constitute the conscience of the Constitution”.
Referring the Bakke’s case which was referred to above, Justice Wanasundara observed that the US Supreme Courts decisions of the last few decades on racial questions had been undoubtedly progressive but Bakke seemed to indicate the prospect of another shift in the judicial thinking of the Court. His Lordship referred to the close decision of the court on two main issues before it and said that Bakke seemed to be in the nature of a trial of strength between the libertarian element on the one hand and conservative element on the other of the Supreme Court, with the result left indecisive.
• Perera v University Grants Commission – FRD (1) 103
In this case the petitioner challenged a policy decision in the matter of selection for admission to the University courses in Bio- Sciences in 1980. There were two separate Advanced Level Examinations in April and August 1979 held on two separate sets of syllabus.
The University Grants Commission decided to adopt a system of allocating the available places to students passing the two examinations in proportion to the numbers attaining the minimum requirement for admission at each examination. A ratio of 7.2: 2.8 was thus adopted. This classification would easily satisfy the first criterion (that is if the classification is based on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes those grouped together from those left out), as the two groups are clearly identifiable, that is those who sat the two separate examinations.
The question was whether the classification was rationally related to the objective of selecting the best students. The Supreme Court held that by the decision to have a common basic aggregate in both examinations, eligibles from both sources were integrated into one class and thereby made equals. Thereafter, they cannot be discriminated against by reference to the original sources. There were no material available to show that one examination was superior. The Court quashed the impugned basis of selection and ordered that admissions be made out of an integrated or consolidated list.
Draft Constitution of 2000
Since 1995, Sri Lanka has been witnessing the making of a new Constitution premised on democracy and enhancing power sharing between different communities. The latest set of proposal on constitutional reform in the form of a Draft Constitution was released by the then Government in 2000. Although this Draft Constitution could not proceed with due to certain circumstances, the comparison of its fundamental right chapter with that of the 1978 Constitution reveals considerable improvements in Draft Constitution.
In the field of economic, social and cultural rights, the Draft fundamental chapter embodies special rights of children (Article 22) including the right of access to free education for every child between the ages of 5 and 14 years (Article 22(6)), the right to ownership of property (Article 21), social rights (Article 25) including access to health care services, sufficient food and water and social assistances as justiciable fundamental rights. In addition right to life (Article 8) and right to equality (Article 11) were also included in it. The inclusion of the aforesaid rights in the Draft Constitution is step in the right direction.
The Draft Constitution of 2000 allows for judicial review of legislation in Sri Lanka for the first time since such a power was inferred under the Soulbury Constitution of 1947. Moreover Article 30(1)(c) of the Draft Constitution also broaden the scope of public interest litigation. Moreover under the 1978 Constitution a fundamental right claim could be made only against violation of administrative and executive action. (Articles 17 and 126 (2)). In the Draft Constitution of 2000 it has been expanded to cover state action. These are very salutary developments in terms of substantive rights and enforcement of such rights compared to the 1978 Constitution.
Therefore this study recommends as also endorsed by the Report of the Public Representations Committee on Constitutional Reforms, the incorporation of judicial review of legislation and justiciable economic, social and cultural rights including a right to education in the proposed Constitution for the proper constitutional governance.
