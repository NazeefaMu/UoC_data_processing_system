Kalutara Health Sector retirees get together

Retired employees of the Health Department and Public Health Inspectors and Kalutara District doctors set up an organisation for their well being as no government had supported them.
Retired Medical Officer Dr. P. P. P. Silva was elected as its President and Retired Chief Public Health Inspector S. Jayasinghe was elected as the Secretary. The inaugural meeting was held at the Panadura Galgoda Sri Maha Vihara on August 24.
Panadura Hospital Development Committee President and Chief Incumbent of the Galgoda Sri Maha Vihara Ven. Pothpitiye Pannasekera Thera said at the meeting that thousands of retired employees of the Health Sector have no organisation to look into their grievances and welfare.
General Secretary Sugathapala Jayasinghe said the New Organisation will look into welfare of the retired employees. He said the new organisation is apolitical and its branches will be set up in every district before long.
