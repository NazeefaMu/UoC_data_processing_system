Selby joins elite in retaining world title

Sheffield: England's Mark Selby successfully defended his world snooker championship on Monday, beating four-time champion John Higgins 18 frames to 15 in a thrilling contest.
The 33-year-old Englishman had trailed 10-4 at one stage but just as he did against Ronnie O'Sullivan in 2014 he fought back to win, becoming only the fourth player in the past 40 years to retain the title.
It was also the third world title in the last four editions for the player fondly known as "The Jester from Leicester".
"I can't believe it, I am still pinching myself now," Selby told the BBC.
"From 10-4 to get to 10-7 yesterday, I was over the moon as I had nothing left. He outplayed me yesterday. Today I came back fresh and was a lot better.
"When I was 10-4 down I was missing everything. I said 'pull something together'. If you lose, you want to at least go down fighting.
"To have three world titles is unbelievable and to be one of only four players to defend it is something I could only dream of."
Selby showed character and grit in the final session when leading 16-14 and ahead in the frame he was judged to have fouled when trying to pull off a snooker behind the black.
Selby contested the foul but after a brief moment of doubt the match official stuck to his original decision and Higgins went on to win it to close the gap to 16-15.
Selby shrugged off what could have been a setback at a pivotal moment in the match to rattle in a break of 131 in the next frame.
"I thought it touched, Jan (Verhaas) said it didn't and I trust him," said Selby later of the referee.
Although Higgins briefly had the upper hand in the next frame all it needed was one error and Selby took full advantage to seal victory with a break of 75. - AFP
