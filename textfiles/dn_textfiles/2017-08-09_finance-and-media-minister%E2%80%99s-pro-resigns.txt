Finance and Media Minister’s PRO resigns

Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera’s Public Relations Officer (PRO) Sameera Manahara resigned from his post yesterday.
Manahara had turned in his letter of resignation to the minister following his arrest in a jeep Saturday with illegal drugs, stating that he decided to resign from his post on moral grounds until he gets a clean chit in the case.
He had said in his letter that Police arrested him because drugs were found inside the jeep.
Police said the jeep Manahara was travelling seized with drugs. He was taken into custody along with other suspects. Manahara said in his letter to Minister Samaraweera, “it seemed that some political elements with sinister aims are trying to tarnish your image and the government by using this incident to their advantage.”
He said Police did not press any drug possession or drug dealing charges against them except the main suspect when the case was heard in Courts. The magistrate granted bail on them.
