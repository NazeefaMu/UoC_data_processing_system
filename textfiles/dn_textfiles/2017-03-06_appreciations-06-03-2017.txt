[APPRECIATIONS - (06-03-2017)]

Manik Fernandopulle
Compassionate soul
His death anniversary which falls on March 6 took me back to the time when he was with Mangala, the charming lady, and their two lovable children: Rishanka and Rukshila.
The few lines to be written show that he is thought of in a warm and special way by all of us. It's been seven years since Manik passed away. “Deep in our hearts, the memory of the one we loved so much shall never be forgotten," said Mangala, recalling the sad day. "He flew away with the angels," said Rukshila. "He must be watching us from above," was the son's remark.
You realize just how much you miss someone only when they are gone.
Manik was a person perfect in every sense of life for them, and they were not prepared for his untimely goodbye. He never failed to keep a close eye on their activities, and showered them with that special love and tender care which is a father's privilege. In Mangala's words: "It will never be the same without him, but we will go on with him in our hearts for all the days of our lives." Hence, it is no secret that his sudden demise on March 6, 2010, caused shock and sadness to all those who knew him. It was the darkest hour in their family life.
His illness took him away at the age of 54. The traumatic grief they underwent was such that they still feel the terrible loss. He was a cultured and refined being who stood by good principles. He hailed from a very respectable and well-known family in Morukkuliya, Dankotuwa. He was the eldest in a family of three boys who were well brought up in the family tradition. His deep love and dedication to his parents was something admired by everyone. He had made a tremendous contribution to his near and dear ones much to their benefit, and his joy.
He enjoyed excellent relationships with his in-laws. He was very lucky to have been blessed with a mother-in-law so loving, and both, he and Mangala, enjoyed every moment of being together with them. Together, they never failed to keep close contact with friends and relations, and at any time of need, never failed to assist them. The stability of a good home being always there achieved many things, and they led a full life.
Manik joined hands with Mangala who was also from an educated and distinguished family of fame. With the strength and courage received from almighty, they lived an exemplary happy wedded life together, sharing their journey through life. She was a loving and enchanting wife who was behind him in all what he did and looked after him well to the last. He had good faith and confidence in himself; he was positive-minded and also devoted to his family. As a devoted husband and father, he was a towering giant in their lives. He was a very close father to have given his son and daughter the correct education and exposure, laying the foundation for their current level of success. It is he who made them what they are today. It is true that their welfare was uppermost in his mind. He was handsome and looked majestic in his tall figure with fair complexion. He was a high-spirited, pleasant, and humble person. His esteemed deeds are still in the hearts of the still-living, and they are greatly proud of him. When going back to his childhood days, he had his early education at Maris Stella College in Negombo, and his secondary education at the most prestigious College in Colombo—St. Joseph's College, where he had a distinguished academic record. He was a bright and promising student of fame and popularity. He became a chemical engineer and achieved many things in his profession. Having completed his engineering degree in India, on his return to Sri Lanka, he did his Master's (MBA) in the Colombo University. He was a remarkable human being with absolute honesty. Through his wisdom, knowledge, and honesty, he had an illustrious career at the Oils and Fats Co-orporation at Seeduwa, and later at Dankotuwa Porcelain, making an immense contribution to its progress.
He was committed, and tirelessly made every effort to carry both colleges to fame. He honoured both alma maters in his life's journey. He was an outstanding member of the St. Joseph's College OBU, Negombo branch. Winning good-will of everybody, he played a key role in promoting vital activities. He was a prominent Rotarian as well. Above all, he had deep religious conviction. He was deeply involved in religious activities, with a deep respect for the church and the clergy.
He knew the essence of the teachings of the Almighty. His loyalty to the church was well-seen in the performance of his religious duties to the last days of his life. Such was the short but precious life of this rare personality.
Though he is no longer with us, the pleasant memories of the years gone by, keep him close to us, loved and remembered as a caring dad and hubby who did so much for us and the family.
In God's care you rest above
while in our hearts you dwell with love.
His rich smell of humanity still exists.
May his soul rest in peace.

Padma Arthenayake
Earnest individual
It is almost an year since Padma Arthenayake had left us for good. That was on February 25, last year. It was only when I phoned to wish her for her birthday on January 24, this year, that I heard the sad news that she was no more, from her daughter, Savanthi.
“Padma” and her husband (he was always “Mr Arthenayake” to us), were truly our well-wishers, and remained so until their demise. We have missed their company and care ever since then.
Padma was the third daughter of Mr. and Mrs. D.W.S. Ekanayake of Bandarawela.
Having had her schooling in Bandarawela, Badulla Central, and finally at Anula Vidyalaya, Nugegoda, she thereafter joined the then Ceylon Law College, where she met her future partner in life. She and Arthe took their oaths as Proctors of the Supreme Court on the same day in 1961 and got married in the same year. Having worked initially at the Incorporated Law Society of Ceylon, she ceased employment due to family commitments. It was in 1970, as a Legal Officer of the Bank of Ceylon, that she re-started work, and thereafter, worked for a short while at NDB. Joining the multinational Nestle Lanka Ltd later, she rose to be its Secretary/Legal Officer. I had the privilege of being professionally associated with her when I was required to represent Nestle around the country. She was a Founding Member and a live wire of the Women Lawyers’ Association. She served it in several capacities, finally ending up as President, besides being an active Committee Member of the Soroptimist International Sri Lanka Chapter. Despite her numerous professional and social commitments, she continued to be a dutiful housewife and a loving mother at their house in “Etiyawala,” which Arthe inherited from his father. Following his father’s principles, alcohol continued to be taboo in the house even under Arthe. Consequently, there were occasions where I had to rush there to clear the house of alcoholic gifts left behind by friends and visitors.
Padma was an excellent cook, and we had hers and Mr Arthenayake’s company whenever a new hotel or restaurant was opened in or around Colombo. Such was their love of fine-dining. Arthe, being a non-alcoholic, made up for it with his love for good cuisine.
As destiny would have it, I had an occasion to visit their home for lunch just the day before Arthe suddenly passed away. It was such a terrible shock to hear from Padma the very next early morning that Arthe had suddenly passed away.
When I was to invest all of my meager savings on a piece of land, and was looking for a reliable Notary to handle the notarial work, Arthe was the obvious choice.
When I wrote to Arthe, introducing myself for the purpose, there was a prompt response, but with one condition: that there will be no professional fee payable, though I did not know him then. Not only did Arthe advice on the matter and handle the conveyance of the block of land where our house stands now, he also advanced the 25% of the auction price on a Sunday when I was out of the country.
Whenever Padma or Arthe heard our claim that we would've never had this house of ours if not for them, they would genuinely get embarrassed and reprimand us. Such was their kindness and modesty.
They had two children: Kavinda, who settled down in USA since 1987, and Savanthi, married to Sopaka.
Padma was a true embodiment of sincere love and kindness. Their domestic-aids were treated not as servants, but as family members. One of them got married, and her husband too, lived with them. Padma was not a 'Madam,' but an 'Amma' to their two daughters. We and our own daughters will always remember her for her generosity and endless kindness to all who were fortunate to meet her.
May she attain the supreme bliss of Nirwana!

Wing Commander Noel Fernando
Estimable friend
Wing Commander Noel Fernando, an exemplary Air Force Officer and a gentleman par excellence, passed away peacefully on January 27. It is with profound grief that I write a few lines on my dear and lifelong friend whom I have closely associated with for over six decades.
Noel had his education at St. Thomas College, Mount Lavinia. He played Cricket and “fives” at College. He loved his school as he was very proud of it.
His name will go down in the history of sports as the man who officially formed the Squash Federation in Sri Lanka and promoted the game of squash.
He was a fine squash player of yesteryear, and excelled in the Masters Game. He was the founding President of squash in Sri Lanka, and in 1981, he was bestowed the title 'Father of Squash' during the Asian Squash championships in Sri Lanka. He was the 63rd President of the Rotary Club, Chairman of the Mission of Seafarers, President of the Travel Trade Association. Noel was elected twice as the President of SKAL.
I first met Noel In January, 1955, when we were undergraduates at Aquinas University. Our friendship continued until his demise. Noel was the second son of a very respectable and devout Buddhist family of four brothers and three sisters.
With the demise of his father very early in life, Noel admirably took over the responsibility of looking after the family with exemplary care, dedication, and affection. In 1955, when the Air Force advertised officer vacancies in the Air Traffic branch, together, we applied to the Air Force also making applications for officer vacancies in the Sri Lankan Army and Sri Lankan Navy. We were fortunate to be selected as Pilot Officers to the Air Traffic Branch of the Sri Lankan Air Force, and were commissioned on 15th June, 1957.
In October, 1957, we were proceeded to the U.K. for training. We received our training with the late N. Sangarapillai and Joe Abeykoon, initially with the Royal Air Force in the Isle of Man and subsequently at Grantham-Derbyshire. Returning to Sri Lanka in December, 1957, we were deployed on Air Traffic duties at Katunayake. Apart from excelling in his primary duties, Noel made a tremendous impact in activities, participating in all social, religious, sports, and other extra-mural activities.
In 1960, when I got married, he was my best man and performed the formalities with precision and affection.
Being a multi-faceted personality with varied interests, he actively participated in all these. My contemporaries found it difficult to understand how he had the energy and capacity to do it. In the mid 1960’s, the development and expansion of the Sri Lankan Air Force was restrained by the lack of foreign exchange.
Development and expansion was inextricably interwoven. With the availability of foreign exchange, Noel, after intensive feasibility studies on his own initiative, and in consultation with Air Chief Marshall P.H. Mendis, made a proposal of an establishment of a commercial wing specially to fly tourists and others in Air Force Helicopters in a view to earn foreign exchange. Ably supported and guided by Air Chief Marshall Paddy Mendis, this project was a tremendous success and helped the country earn much-needed foreign exchange.
Noel was constantly commended for his initiative and dedication to duty. He was endowed with rare personal qualities. Noel made a tremendous contribution in every human activity he undertook. Being a fine conversationalist with a flair for public relations, he was a great asset to the Air Force and private organizations he served. After an impressive and distinguished service of 22 years, Noel retired from the Air Force on September 6, 1979.
He joined Thomas Cook as the Managing Director, and he completely restructured the company, enhancing the business image of it. Subsequently, as General Manager of Finlays Travels, he made a significant impact on this variegated career in the private sector and earning a reputation as a distinguished and respected personality in the Travel Trade.
Noel married Hyacinth, who was a great strength to him in his challenging duties, and looked after him with admirable care and affection. Noel was a very domesticated person. His love, affection, and dedication to his family was admirable.
A devout Buddhist, he practiced his religion unobtrusively, observing the four “Sathara Brahma” love, kindness, compassion, altruistic joy and equanimity.
He gave generously to places of religious worship. Throughout his life, he epitomized kindness, love, and compassion for the poor and marginalized. Noel was a wonderful friend who reached out to his friends particularly in times of distress. He was steadfast in his loyalty to his friends.
He was my friend and guide up-to his demise. I have lost my irreplaceable dear friend, and an emptiness remains in me that I cannot seem to fill.
I realize how real the immortal words of Charles Colton “True friendship is like sound health; the value of it is seldom known until it is lost." I thank God for his life. I will not say farewell because I know we will meet again.
- J.T. REX FERNANDO
Prof. J.N.O. Fernando
Brilliant intellect
March 2, 2015, dawned as usual, and we the staff of the Department of Chemistry at the Open University of Sri Lanka (OUSL) were at a staff meeting in the office of the Head of the Department. The meeting was interrupted abruptly when the message of the sudden demise of Emeritus J.N.O. Fernando (JNOF), retired Senior Professor of Chemistry at OUSL, trickled in. We were dumbstruck; we remained speechless for some time, unable to digest the news.
JNOF was a giant, both literally and otherwise. His contribution to the progress of the OUSL as Senior Professor of Chemistry, as Head of the Department of Chemistry, and as Dean of the Faculty of Natural Sciences, has been recorded and published previously, and needs no repetition.
JNOF was considered synonymous with Institute of Chemistry Ceylon (ICHEMC) located at Rajagiriya.
In other words, he was considered as the “Institute" as a result of the enormous contribution that he made to the development of ICHEMC. He was a giant who bestrode the corridors of both, Open Unversity (until his retirement), and ICHEMC, like a colossus—an excellent administrator who stood by principles at all times.
His famous statement, best said in Sinhalese, "Kiyana dey karanawa; karana dey kiyanawa,” still echoes among his contemporaries, including eminent and distinguished academics as Emeritus Professor Nalini Ratnasiri, Emeritus Professor Uma Coomaraswamy, and Emeritus Professor Dayantha Wijeyesekara.
Prof. JNOF did not mince his words. He expressed his ideas and opinion on many matters with great conviction and determination; there were not many who could counter his point-of-view (though they do now in his absence). His candid opinion was sought after by his peers on many matters.
Tributes and appreciation letters came in droves during the period after his untimely death. A special publication of the Chemistry in Sri Lanka [the quarterly magazine published by the Institute of Chemistry Ceylon (ICHEMC)] containing a collection of such articles dedicated to the late Professor was published, and was ceremoniously launched in the midst of a large gathering of his family members and close associates.
Prof. JNOF was a top scholar at St.Thomas College, Mt Lavinia, and the recipient of several scholarships at the time. In turn, he was instrumental in establishing many awards, scholarships, prizes, etc. at ICHEMC which went a long way in motivating the students.
I am sure the past graduate chemists, more than a thousand of them who may or may not be here, will attest to this fact. In keeping with his vision, a scholarship fund was initiated at the first death anniversary commemoration ceremony.
Prof. JNOF led a full life before his untimely demise. No doubt there is a lot for all of us to learn.
He made a lot of sacrifices to create more opportunities for those aspiring for higher education, a national need at present, given the increasing number of A.L. qualified students wanting to pursue higher studies. In addition to his numerous official duties, he held many positions in learned bodies including SLAAS (as General President), OPA, NASL, etc. contributing immensely in their development activities.
On a personal note, I would like to mention that as my mentor, he was instrumental in recruiting me as a temporary demonstrator at the department of chemistry at OUSL in 1990.
That appointment 26 years ago has led me to my current position as Senior Lecturer in Chemistry.
He also persuaded me to take up the post of Vice President in the Council of ICHEMC, the stepping stone for the post of President which I hold now. Unfortunately, he did not live to witness the day that I took up that position.
The second death anniversary of Emeritus Professor J.N.O. Fernando fell on March 2, and a commemoration ceremony was held at the Institute of Chemistry Ceylon (ICHEMC) with the unveiling of his bust, and a memorial oration was delivered by Emeritus Professor Eng. Dayantha Wijeyesekara, former Vice Chancellor of OUSL, and presently Chancellor of the University of Vocational Technology (UNIVOTEC)
Memories of Late Emeritus Professor J.N.O. Fernando will remain etched in our minds for a long time to come. No doubt, his family members: wife, Mrs. Mandrupa; son, Oshan; daughter-in-law, Gayathri; and granddaughter, Maia; will miss him, but continue to remember him in their hearts forever.
Let us all offer a silent tribute and prayer for the Man—Jerence Nansel Oleap Fernando.
