Performance... perseverance...and pressure to survive

All islanders hail the timely arrival of May and its traditional customs that bind us together...From our ocean to the mountains and everything in between.
The fortunate inhabitants on planet rugby, undeterred by developments…we’re treated to some scintillating game time in the middle.
At home a fabulous final leg of the 74th Bradby, proudly supported by Singer Sri Lanka, and a hugely anticipated Royal saga.
But only those who managed to catch the game in Pallekelle ...will cheer both sides ...
The Bradby conclusion is always a mighty occasion, whichever way you choose to observe our young gladiators in the middle.
I for one was looking forward and hugely confident that the lion’s heart would stand up under pressure, and surprise Royal wholesale.
In fact, all considered, pundits and resident experts included...I expected Trinity to win the leg!
Here was a golden...nay platinum of opportunities to come out blazing, and stamp some class.
Well it almost stepped up and shocked our nation.
Belief and commitment was the balm prescribed...but what we got was a first half of hesitancy and soft options, despite decent possession.
Unfortunately and for obscure reasoning...Trinity chose to wait for Royal to run at them.
Reid Avenue already had the cabinet dusted and polished for the shield.
Trinity’s emergence from slumber, resulting in 3 stupendous tries that ignited the lion’s faithful, and much relief for Lote Raikebule and staff.
Had they decided to run hard and play out of their skins ...a famous victory was written on that wall.....
Alas, history and reality handed Royal a clinical finish and tantalizing victory that almost looked like clocking up a century from both legs.
The game needed stubborn heart and much courage from the lion’s den.
Then skill, pace, power and brute finish to stifle the tuskers.
What a grand Bradby indeed.
Now we shift back off Olympus, breathe the sea level oxygen, and refocus on the Singer league....
Can the unbeaten tag that Royal own be taken from them?
Can St. Joseph’s really slide up the rankings or will the Joe-Pete shatter all expectations?
Mesmerizing matchups...Peters v Trinity and Royal v Peter’s before the month of June runs in.
What the stars forecast and the oracle will present...might just be one and the same. Royal for the title or Peters to the front and shocks again...What a relentless season it’s become..utterly absorbing and right down to the wire.
Only time, injuries and the fittest will dictate in the end ....both mental and physical conditioning, the vital difference between victor and vanquished in paradise.
Reality bites when you least expect...
I am hopeful that all is well and clean on the nutrition/performance platform.
Assuredly it has been a heart throbbing, max on max, in the middle for 70mins, right across the Singer premier school leagues.
But most importantly, I hope it is without the extra benefits of listed performance enhancing stimulants.
Naturally the system must be locked and schools totally responsible for player wellness and honest fair play.
There must be a clinical defined formidable line that embraces the virtues of a level playing field at all times.
No hint of compromise ...or leniency at any given turn or time.
Well played to all the schools, well done all the coaching and management...essentially the backroom team that are on the button 24x7...
I am confident that all investors and old boys plus parents believe in the same and stand for those fundamental principles of fair play and justice at all times.
The game is greater than all of us, it s a colossus that strides the planet with consummate ease ...it is up to us Sri islanders to embrace and stand firm.
If we inculcate those principles in our kids ...so they carry that same flag with honesty, respect and pride ...on and off the field.
The code is mighty indeed.
All hail the island rugby heart and the grandest most relentless season so far.
Cheers to the players who make the games so special.
Bula bula Sri apey!
