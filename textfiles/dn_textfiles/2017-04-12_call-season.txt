Traditional games
Now back to the memories of the Sinhala Hindu New Year amidst warmth, the love of the family, relatives and friends. The sound of Koha reminds you of the Avurudu season bringing joy to the children who in their innocence await their funfilled day with traditional New Year games. This is the most wonderful time of the year for children in village areas. Kadju trees are in full bloom with dry nuts for traditional games, as well as raw ones for the table as the traditional curry on the New Year day. Exotic flora – flame colo used red flowers on Erabadu trees are another signal of the dawn of the New Year. The sound of raban played to the tune of traditional folk songs and melodies are a striking feature of the arrival of the New Year. Prior to the New Year a series of activities take place in both Buddhist and Hindu abodes, mostly in rural areas. Entire premises are cleaned. Colour washing, polishing the floors, varnishing the household furniture are the main tasks carried out prior to the eventful day. Shops are overcrowded with customers buying new clothing for the entire family. Streets are filled with shoppers, along pavement and also in shopping complexes. City shops are illumined in the night with all kinds of gifts for the New Year.
The house becomes a live of activity with the preparation of traditional sweets with kevun, kokis, aasmi etc being given prominence. The indigenous varieties of food like pickle, brinjal palm and fish ambulthial truly resemble the traditional atmosphere. Hindu specialities are mostly mouth-watering cuisine like crispy murukku, vadai, dosai and munguli etc and mung rice in banana leaf. Cooking for the New Year is done in newly bought pots and pans. Customs traditions and rituals play a vital role in the entire event, they are all observed with utmost ease and devotion. Auspicious times are observed to the very letter with the belief that any mishap will bring bad luck to the house or the family.
Electronic media
The Avurudu table, laid with the traditional oil lamp to be lit at the auspicious time by the chief of the family – the father before partaking of Avurudu meal reflects the love and faith, unity and culture. The sound of crackers act as the “time keeper”. At present the electronic media too facilitate the event. Paying obeisance to elders and parents will be the next item. Money transactions also take place as a part of the procedure. The leaf of betel figures prominently on all these occasions. Even those outside Lankan shores sometimes return for the sake of the family unity creating an exceedingly happy moment for their near and dear ones. Religious aspects – places of religious worship too create a proud land mark in the activities of the day.
Religious rites
The temple for the Buddhists and kovil for the Hindus are vital link and they perform their religious rites with high confidence for a bountiful New Year. They visit the temple during the non-auspicious time called “Nonagatha” meaning no-nekatha and spend time venerating the Triple Gem for a blissful new year. Still later another celebrated traditional event is bathing for the first time after the new year anointing the head with medicinal oil (Na-anu). Another custom adhered to is the setting out for work at an auspicious time.
Further the New Year binds you together with precious bonds, bringing homely pleasures and the delight of sharing with all the relatives, friends, and neighbours irrespective of race or religion. Mention should be made here of my immediate neighbour and friend, an exception, a non Buddhist, yet who celebrates both New Year and Christmas entertaining the entire lane.
Sincerity is what makes the occasion special. Jealousy, enmity, hatred and anger disappear when visiting one another for the new year. This is an age old practice for the younger generation to get accustomed to. Still another remarkable feature of the new year is celebrating the event with traditional games, bearing competitions and various other related activities, organized, participated and enjoyed by the youth islandwide termed as Bak Maha Ulela. Hence the New Year should be hailed for its mammoth contribution for national unity.
