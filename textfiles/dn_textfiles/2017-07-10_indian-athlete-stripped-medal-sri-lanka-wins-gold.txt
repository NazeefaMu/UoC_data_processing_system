Indian Athlete stripped off medal: Sri Lanka wins gold

 
India's Archana Adhav was stripped off her gold medal after complaints of infringement from Sri Lankan runner up Nimali Waliwarsha Konda, who was later declared winner of women's 800m race at the 22nd Asian Athletics Championships on Sunday.
Archana, was declared the winner in the half mile distance with her personal best time of 2 minutes and 2 seconds but Nimali later protested that the Indian athlete pushed her from behind before overtaking near the finish line.
Archana was disqualified and Nimali (2:05:23) was awarded the gold medal, while another Sri Lankan Gayanthika Thushari (2:05:27) took the silver.
Japan's Fumika Omori (2:06:50) won the bronze.
Eventhough Archana applied to reconsider the decision, the jury of technical delegates refused saying that it was an unanimous decision.
