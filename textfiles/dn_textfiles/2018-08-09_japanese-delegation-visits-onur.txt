A delegation comprising Takefumi Akai, Mayor of City of Akaiwa in Okayama Prefecture and Japan-based Association of Medical Doctors of Asia (AMDA) including high school students from Japan, visited the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) on Tuesday in Colombo.
While extending their support towards the reconciliation process in Sri Lanka, the discussion attended by ONUR officials, centered on the possible cooperation in reconciliation related educational programmes for schoolchildren.
AMDA President Dr. Shigeru Suganami and ONUR Director General M. S. Jayasinghe said there has been an excellent peace building, development and reconciliation relationship between the two countries and agreed to be co-partners in the next year’s student symposium on peace, annually organized by the AMDA.
ONUR Director General M. S. Jayasinghe appreciated Japan for the support given to Sri Lanka as a true friend, as well as internationally during the past conflict period.
A message of goodwill from the Mayor of Hiroshima was delivered by one of the students.
ONUR Additional Director General Nimal Hettiarachchi and the AMDA Peace Project Coordinator also spoke.
