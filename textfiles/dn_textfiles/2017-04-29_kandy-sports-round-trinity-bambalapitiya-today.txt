In the first round Trinity playing in segment II “A” won all five games. St. Peter’s who played in segment me “A” out of six games won three and lost three. The Trinitians who are brimming with confidence after their spate of victories and go out firm favourites to win this game. Trinity should continue their run of victories as they were the only side in their segment to be unbeaten in the first round. They have a powerful set of forwards and their three quarters are moving gallantly, their forte is to attack from the moment they are on the move. The Peterites, though not so formidable should look up to their talented players for a good show, playing on their home territory they should do well. Where others have failed this season can the Peterites succeed and become the first team to conquer Trinity this season?
