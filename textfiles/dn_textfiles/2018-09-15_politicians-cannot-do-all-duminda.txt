Politicians cannot do all - Duminda

Irrigation, Water Resources and Disaster Management Minister Duminda Dissanayake said the public must understand that politicians are not omnipotent and they do not have to lead every aspect from attending a funeral to laying foundation for a culvert or commissioning a new bridge.
The Minister was addressing farmer organisations’ representatives in Mahawilachchiya recently.
“People do not understand that the officials from grassroots level to the top are planning, designing and implementing development work by using government funds in consultation with the parliamentarians,” he said.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe takes steps to develop commercial sector and President Maithripala Sirisena help develop the agricultural sector to upgrade the economy, he said.
“Ministers in England and Singapore do not go from village to village to supervise construction or to participate in every ceremonial openings,” the Minister said.
He said the ministers should be present where plans are executed and decisions are made. They must correct discrepancies, shortcomings, and lapses at the top level. “But now we are expected to save the government, the party and ourselves,” he said.
He said that under the directions of the President steps have been taken to remove sediment in water sources and renovate canals and tanks. He said 85,000 families in the Anuradhapura district including Mahawilachchiya are receiving drought relief.
