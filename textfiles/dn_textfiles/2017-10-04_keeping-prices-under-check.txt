Keeping prices under check

I refer to the news item under the heading “President instructs reduction of prices of some essential items”. It goes on to say that the President instructed the officials to reduce prices of some essential items.
The President is rightly concerned about the prices of essential items since they affect the living conditions of the people. Most people are more or less on fixed incomes and cannot cope with increases in prices in the short run since their incomes are more or less fixed. Almost since the 1950s, the governments of the day have asked the Food Commissioner and the CWE to be engaged in the import and distribution of essential food commodities consumed by the people.
They did so since the local wholesale and retail markets were small and were controlled by a few importer-wholesalers. The obvious answer was for the government authorities also to be engaged in the import trade of these essentials. So the Food Commissioners Department and the CWE by being engaged in their trade played a key role to keep prices under check preventing local importer-wholesalers from taking advantage of temporary market scarcities due to shipping delays or seasonal shortages in the import source countries - and sometimes even creating such scarcities. When dhal was short in India it was necessary to import lentils from the Middle Eastern countries. We consume a lot of imported food items and attempts to produce them locally have been bedevilled by the high domestic costs of production (due to years of inflationary deficit finance by the populist governments since 1956).
Domestic production costs
So although closely integrated with the world economy we have moved out of step with world production prices and hence import prices have been cheaper despite several depreciations of the Rupee. This has caused continuous deficits in our balance of trade which have been met only from the remittances of our migrant women workers abroad. But our attempts to produce domestically have hardly succeeded because of our higher domestic costs of production. o we have had to subsidize domestic production costs to domestic producers since imports were often cheaper. But we cannot be continuous lotus eaters and we must export in order to import. So we have to promote exports and maintain an export growth equal to our import growth rate. Presently our import growth rate is roughly double that of the export growth rate and this is not sustainable. So we cannot give up on our domestic production of import substitutes.
Promote export growth
If so we must accept higher domestic prices instead of stressing the reduction of prices. While consumers like lower prices producers prefer higher prices. The government must give greater preference to production than consumption if we want development.
So too much emphasis on reducing prices is not in our long-term interests. Some people have a mistaken faith in the free market to achieve trade equilibrium. But we have to make conscious efforts to promote export growth rate to at least equal our import growth rate. But our domestic price structure is out of alignment with world market prices and we must support the prices of our domestic production by limiting competing imports by imposing protective tariffs to safeguard our domestic production processes and products. So the consumer has to pay the price of such support for domestic production for the lopsided situation cannot be allowed to last forever.
So ordering the reduction of domestic prices may be detrimental to domestic production. What the government can do is to remove duties on imports but maintain them at a level competitive with domestic production prices. But attempts to administratively reduce prices of products in the domestic consumer market may not be desirable for our domestic production processes.
We have to give preference to production over consumption if we are to become a developed country.
What the government can and must do is to stop deficit financing of the budget through inflationary bank borrowing and use only borrowing from the public to fund its budget deficit. It would be better still if the government avoids budget deficits altogether. It is only then we can continue to be integrated with the world economy without adverse effects on our domestic production.
