Sri Sathya Sai Baba  - The “God Man”

Late Sai Baba’s birthday falls today and celebrations will be held by way of blood donations, other social service acts and Bajan singing all over the world through thousands of Sai centres.
A boy born in the poor remote village Puttaparthy in Andra Predesh in India on November 23, 1926 was named Sathya Narayan Raju by his parents, Eashwaraamma and Pedavenkaram Raju Ratnakara. His siblings included an elder brother Selsha Raju, sisters Venkanna, Parvathamma and younger brother Janakirammiah.
He became famous in the village from his birth, for some mysterious things happened at the time he was born. His father was a music lover and it is said that his music instruments made music when he was born and a cobra appeared on the bed. He was different as a small child. Parents found that he was fed by some divine force. He displayed special intelligence. Began materialising things like food and objects like pens and pencils and erasers at the school going age for his friends and was charitable. He was a happy boy with extra intelligence where he knew things beyond the teachers. He was known as the “miracle child” in the school.
Thinking he was possessed by a demon spirit he was “Reincarnation of the Shirdi Sai Baba” that lived in Maharasthra and died eight years ago. As a boy of fourteen years he walked out of the house saying that he had a divine mission to perform and no longer belongs to the family. He performed enormous miracles to the people around him and soon people began to gather around him and worshiping him as their “Guru”. Famous people including politicians began to come to him and by 1944, a mandir was erected in Puttaparthy for him which was named by him as “Prasanthi Nilayam”. He said that there will be a time that people will have to use binoculars to see him. He proclaimed that the “World will come to Puttaparthy and thousands of sick who came to him and were healed.
In 1954, Sathya Sai Baba established the first social service project, a small free general hospital in the Puttaparty. It was in 1963 that Sai Baba predicted that he will reincarnate after his death as Prema Sai.
Words of Sathya Sai explain his mission. “I have come to light the lamp of love in your heart. I have not come here on behalf of some exclusive religion. I have not come on a mission of publicity for a sect, a creed or cast. Nor have I come to collect followers for a doctrine. I have no plan to attract disciples into my fold or any fold. I have come to tell you of the unitary faith and spiritual principle, this path of love, this virtue of love, this duty of love and this obligation of love.”
His mission embraced the entire India. Every Prime Minister and President went for his blessings. He established universities, hospitals, super speciality hospitals that did kidney and heart transplants and the best of doctors worked free. Average of over 25,000 people arrived in Puttaparthy every day. Buildings began to rise all over Puttaparthy. Foreign devotees form all over the world built huge buildings with hundreds of units.
True to the prediction of Sathya Sai Baba the small remote village became a place of world focus. An airport was established. The west came to Puttaparty to celebrate Christmas. All Buddhist countries jointly celebrated Vesak in Puttparthy. Hindus flocked for all Hindu festivals. Millions came to celebrate Sai Baba’s birthday.
Though he never had a recognised school education, he established universities, served as the chancellor of them guiding the professors and students, he guided the engineers in construction work, and he made key note addresses to medical professionals. He was a great speaker when his speeches were translated to English language he corrected the translator. He proved his omni presence to the devotees beyond doubt. I have experienced it myself. Hundreds of books have been written on him.
Sai Baba in 1995 commenced a drinking water project to the Anathapur District, through love to end the suffering of 1.2 million people without water. The Sai world flocked to help him with the funds required and it was accomplished within a short period of four years.
He continued his mission on education and established several schools and universities. The disciplines of these institutes remain unmatched. Sai baba lovingly addressed as “Swami” by his devotees collected letters from his devotees. Many posted him letters. There cannot be anyone in the world who received so many letters. On April 24, 2011 having lived for 84 years he passed away. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh , Congress President Sonia Gandhi, Cricketers including Sachin Tendulkar and devotees from more than 100 countries attended the funeral together with more than five hundred thousand people. His mission and the Sathya Sai trust continues the good work initiated by Sai Baba and for the devotees making them feel that “Swami is with them as before”.
