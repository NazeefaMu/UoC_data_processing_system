Muslim schoolteachers left in chaos
The postponement of Muslim school holiday has made a huge chaos among Muslim schoolteachers. The second term holiday for Muslim schools was supposed to start from August 18 and ends on August 28. But the Education Ministry has put off the date to August 31 and reopening on September 11.
There is a separate school calendar for Muslim schools sent by Education Ministry at the beginning of every year. In the schedules, they have instructed to close the school on August 18. But the Ministry’s sudden and unexpected postponement of the holiday has frustrated the entire holiday programme of teachers.
Moreover, there are teachers with pre-arranged foreign trips and medical check-up. They are now facing a lot of inconvenience due to the sudden postponement of holidays. I would like to raise this question from the ministry officials – Muslims in particular - involved in preparing and scheduling the Muslim school calendar as to why not pre-consider this situation on preparing the annual plan.
It is apparently clear that the Hajj Festival falls on September 1 and you could have arranged the holidays accordingly without making this blunder. It has left the Muslim schoolteachers in a pathetic and embarrassing situation.
I kindly request you to be vigilant and careful when you prepare a new annual plan for schools next year.
