Three youth and 10 adults who needed medical assistance were assisted through the Health Development Fund, on the initiative of Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne.
The three youth will undergo surgeries in Sri Lanka and abroad. Two of them will undergo bone marrow transplants for thalassemia. Two women patients who underwent liver surgery in India are now in need of expensive medication.
The three youth were given Rs. 9.1 million for their medical treatment, while the two women patients were given over Rs. 1 million to purchase medicines and eight patients received Rs. 8.1 million, the Ministry said.
The Health Minister had found out about the patients from various newspaper articles requesting public assistance.
