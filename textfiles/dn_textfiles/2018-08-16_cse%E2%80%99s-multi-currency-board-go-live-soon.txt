CSE’s Multi Currency Board  to go live soon

The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) will introduce the proposed Multi Currency Board which will enable overseas companies to list and raise capital in US dollars in three months.
The CSE is currently working with the regulator to obtain necessary approvals, Chief Executive Officer of CSE Rajeeva Bandaranaike said in an interview with the Daily News Business.
“Once that is done, we hope it can be launched in another three months,” he said.
Commenting on domestic and foreign investor participation in overall market activities, Bandaranaike said the present market scenario has created opportunities for investors to buy stocks at relatively low prices.
“The market is at very cheap multiples. This is not the time to sell; this is the ideal time to purchase shares. Compared to local investor base, the international investors have identified potential opportunities in our stocks. We are hoping that local investors will avail themselves with this opportunity of buying stocks at relatively cheap prices.”
In addition, a sizeable public holding is a necessity for a transparent and liquid market, he said. “Various rules and regulations have been introduced to address the liquidity issue in the capital market.” “The CSE has introduced minimum public rules and enforcement rules. We’re sort of pushing companies to increase their public float to increase the liquidity in the market.”
Therefore, a minimum public holding as a continuous listing requirement is introduced with the aim of promoting a liquid and transparent market with a better price discovery mechanism.
Commenting on how vulnerable the capital market is to a tightening in the global market, Bandaranaike said, the global economy has come under severe stress and at the same time growth of Sri Lankan economy has slowed down due to various factors.
“Due to changes in the US fed rate hikes, we are seeing an outflow of funds from the Asian regions back to the USA. All the equity markets in Asia have impacted including Sri Lanka in terms of foreigners moving their funds away from capital markets into the USA. All the equity markets including our markets are a bit sensitive to these measures.”
“It is important that we also drive the local investor; so that we can cushion the impact of foreign investors when they exit the market. Unfortunately, our local institutions are not that active,” he said.
At present, the market is subsided due to lack of local investor participation, it is the foreigners who have been active even during last year and even up to now,” he said. “It is very important that our local institutes, the private sector, high net worth investors and retailers get active in the market now, to sustain the market growth.”
In a bid to trigger a fresh round of investor interest, the CSE has plans to conduct two overseas road shows. Accordingly, the CSE is planning to hold the first road show towards the end of this year and the second one in 2019. However, the CSE has not made a decision on the final locations of the proposed road shows.
