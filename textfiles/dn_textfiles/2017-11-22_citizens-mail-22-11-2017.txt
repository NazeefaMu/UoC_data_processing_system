Animal friendly Budget for 2018
On Daily News of November 11, Animal Rights Activist Lalani Perera has commented that Budget 2018 includes animal friendly elements which are laudable. She also states, “globally the trend is to close down zoos”, hinting for a better tomorrow for the animals held captive in the Sri Lankan zoo.
I want to add a few suggestions in support of this highly compassionate idea for the future of caged animals.
In a zoo, the animals held imprisoned for life, are not even guilty of a crime.
However large or “open air” a zoo is, it is infinitely small compared to the vast habitat wild animals are born to. So it is torture beyond compare to confine them to a lifetime of restricted movement, where their natural instincts in the joys of eating, playing, mating and sleeping are so thoroughly inhibited, as to make them tense and depressed.
They have an inborn fear of man. Imagine the trauma of being exposed to the nearness of their enemy, on a daily basis!
Our zoo should be closed down. The animals can be sent off to the countries or places of their birth. The others, who cannot be relocated for some reason or another, can be looked after till death, in a pleasant area in the premises, away from the eyes of the visitors.
A Virtual Reality Cinema and Park, should replace the zoo. Wide screens, with stereo sound, can be set up to show excellent documentaries of the various animals living in their natural habitat.
For a nominal fee, pamphlets on the lifecycle of the wild animals should be made available to educate the visitors.
The rest of the zoological gardens should be artistically laid out with trees, waterways, restaurants etc, to make it a pleasing environment for the visitors to pass the time.
Closing down our zoo and setting up a Virtual Reality Cinema and Park will showcase to the world our ethical behaviour towards defenceless and innocent wild animals, who are at the moment cruelly incarcerated for life, in zoos.
