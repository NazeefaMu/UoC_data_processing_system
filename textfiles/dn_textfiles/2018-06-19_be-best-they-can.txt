To be the  best they can

25 years of success! The beginning of it all was the dream of a single individual Mohan Lal Grero. His dream of a Sri Lankan student population proficient in the English Language became a reality with the establishment of the Lyceum International School on June 14, 1993. The dream developed into his Vision and then into his Mission, and the Mission of the school is “To enhance the potential of every young soul that passes through our halls, empowering them to be the best they can do”.
It seemed then ‘a mission impossible’. In reality, however, in proved to be quite possible. As a teacher who joined the school on September 6, 1993 with the opening of the Primary School and yet works as an AL teacher for the Upper School of Lyceum, I have observed the transition over the years and can now very sincerely state that this mission has been, in every sense of the word, fulfilled.
I have witnessed the growth of Lyceum from infancy to adulthood. I have observed the advancements, the successes, the great heights reached and the national and international recognition earned by Lyceum; and, I have marveled at the sheer skill with which all this has been made possible in such a short span of time as a mere 25 years. In fact today we boast of 8 branch schools established in diverse parts of the country, namely Kandana, Panadura, Wattala, Ratnapura, Gampaha, Nuwara-Eliya, Anuradhapura and Kurunegala. The significant fact about it all is that equal attention and supervision is maintained with respect to all these branch schools to keep up the standards of each and every one of them.
One naturally wonders, perhaps, as to how all this could have been possible in such a short time. However, having come to understand, over the years, the methodical nature and the meticulous attention given to detail, from Day One to date in any and every venture undertaken by the Founder of our school Mr. Mohan Lal Grero and his wife the Principal of the school Kumari Grero (a very diplomatic lady indeed), I am by no means surprised; only, more and more impressed.
One cannot but be impressed beyond measure when one sees the advancement of the facilities afforded by the school. Lyceum International School which began with the Nursery and Pre Grade on June 14, 1993 rose up to the AL Commerce and Science streams in its very first two years. From the start, all religions were given time for study and prayer. Discipline was maintained to the maximum. And the little known Lyceum gradually grew into a more and more sought after International School of no mean repute. Currently, Lyceum has both National and Cambridge AL and OL streams. In addition to the academic curriculum, extra curricular activities were added on. For our Founders undoubtedly believed in the old adage, “All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy”! Sports as Cricket, Basketball, Netball, Soccer, Swimming, Badminton etc. (You name it, you get it!) received a very special place. Cultural Kandyan Dancing flowered out. Scouts, Girl Guides and even Little Friends increased in numbers. Public Speaking was given a very special place and made part of the school curriculum from Grade 1 itself.
We now have our own Broadcasting and Media Clubs as well and our very special Channel 100.8 Lyceum FM was launched to celebrate the 25th Anniversary of Lyceum Nugegoda.
