PickMe at Colombo International Book Fair ’17

For the third consecutive year, homegrown taxi hailing service PickMe will be rolling out a special transport plan for those visiting the Colombo international Book Fair (CBIF) from September 15 to 24, at the BMICH.
The company has acquired special permission from BMICH to use Gate 3A on Malalasekara Mawatha for their taxi fleet of three wheelers, mini cars, cars and vans to pick up visitors who have requested for a PickMe taxi. Each driver will be provided with a special vehicle pass to access the gate from 9am to 11pm from the book fair.
This will encourage book fair goers to visit the book fair in an affordable, safe PickMe taxi and relieve the pressure off from many visitors who would come on their own vehicle and looking for a decent parking slot inside or outside of BMICH.
Highly regarded as the biggest book fair of the entire Asian region, CIBF happens every year at the Sirimavo Bandaranaike Memorial Exhibition Centre with more than 400 book stalls and over one million visitors.
PickMe will also have a special taxi waiting station for their drivers at the BMICH premises as well as an interactive stall where PickMe staff members will be available throughout the day to educate people about the company, answer and resolve any query related to the PickMe app.
As one of the largest organized taxi platform in Sri Lanka, PickMe currently services the Colombo region's complete transportation needs and maintains a base of over half a million registered users of the PickMe app and a taxi fleet of over ten thousand, including three wheelers, mini cars, cars and vans. PickMe recently debuted its newest feature ‘PickMe VIP’ which is a fleet chauffeur-driven, luxury cars that cater to premium clients and corporates.
