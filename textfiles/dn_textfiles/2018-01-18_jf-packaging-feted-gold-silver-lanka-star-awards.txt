JF Packaging feted with gold, silver at Lanka Star Awards

JF Packaging, a forerunner in Sri Lanka’s packaging industry and mainly focused on providing integrated flexible packaging solutions and product development, received two Gold and three Silver Lanka Star awards at the recent Lanka Star Awards for 2017, organised by the Sri Lanka Institute of Packaging.
The two Gold Awards were for ‘Bio Degradable Pouch’ produced for the domestic market and ‘High Barrier Film’ developed using Nano Technology while the three Silvers were for ‘Anti-Bacterial films for Fresh Milk with Nano Compounds’, ‘High Tech Rotogravure Print for Pet Food’ and their remarkable achievement on reduction of polyethylene granules imports by 25% for flexible packaging.
The Company clinched a double victory by winning five Asian Star awards which swelled its haul of awards to ten. JF Packaging goes on record as being the Most Awarded Flexible Packaging Company, a historical achievement by a Sri Lankan company.
“We are delighted and deeply humbled to be recognised for our continuous efforts to provide finest quality products and solutions the Sri Lankan packaging industry has seen. These awards inspire us to keep this momentum going and steadfastly continue with more innovative and sustainable packaging solutions and product designs”, said K. P. David, Managing Director of JF Packaging.
“We advocate the maintenance of superior standards while our skilled and qualified staff works with the newest technology at our state-of-the-art facility. JF Packaging complies with local and international standards including the ISO 20000:2005, ISO9001:2008, HACCP certification and FSSC 22000 standard certifications”, he added.
