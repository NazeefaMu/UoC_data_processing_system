Vote on Account passed with 96 vote majority

A Vote on Account totalling to Rs.1,765 billion to cover Government expenditure of the first quarter of next year was passed in Parliament with a majority of 96 votes yesterday.
It received 102 votes in favour and six votes against. The UNF and TNA MPs voted in favour while JVP MPs voted against.
SLFP MPs Vijith Vijayamuni Soysa, Lakshman Seneviratne and A.H.M.Fowzie, who recently crossed over to the Government, also voted in favour. All UPFA MPs in the Opposition including former President Mahinda Rajapaksa were not present at the time of voting. TNA Leader R Sampanthan was also absent. The division was called by the JVP at the end of the debate.
A total of 116 MPs were absent. Speaking during the debate, UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera however said that they do not wish to vote against the Vote on Account as public servants’ salaries and other payments depend upon it.
Presenting the Vote on Account, Minister Mangala Samaraweera said a full-budget for next year would be presented in January and passed in February after a month-long debate.
The minister said that the ‘Gamperaliya’ programme would be resumed from January and the allocation for each electoral division to implement the programme would be increased upto Rs.300 million from Rs.200 million.
A ‘Vote on Account’ is presented when a new government has just been sworn in and has had no time to present a proper budget. This procedure is a convention of Parliament and finds no mention in either the Constitution or the Standing Orders. In a Vote of Account, Parliament does not pass funds for new projects, only to those that are in progress. Departments and public agencies are allocated funds to the extent that services essential to the community have to be maintained.
According to the Vote on Account presented yesterday, the Government expects to raise Rs.990 billion as loans (foreign or local) in the first quarter of the year.
An allocation of Rs.57 billion has been made for the Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Ministry. An allocation of Rs.30 billion has been made for education and another Rs.19 billion for higher education for the first quarter of next year according to the Vote on Account.
National Policies, Economic Affairs, Resettlement, Rehabilitation, Northern Province Development, Vocational Training and Skills Development and Youth Affairs Ministry held by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is been allocated Rs 31 billion.
The Expenditure Head of the President is Rs 4.39 billion and the Expenditure Head of the Prime Minister’s Office is Rs 503 million. The Defence Ministry coming under the purview of the President has been allocated Rs. 9 billion. No separate Expenditure Head for Law and Order Ministry is given in the Vote on Account as it has been taken over by the President. Environment and Mahaweli Development Ministry coming under the purview of the President has been allocated Rs.12 billion.
The Opposition Leader’s Office has been allocated Rs.29 million. Parliament has been allocated Rs 915million.
Following the vote, the House was adjourned till 1pm on January 8.
 
[UPFA supports Vote on Account]
UPFA General Secretary MP Mahinda Amaraweera yesterday in Parliament pledged his unconditional support to the progressive moves of the Government by putting the country before the political party.
The senior MP said that they support the Vote on Account as the salaries and other payments of the public servants depend on it.
Taking the floor during the debate on the Vote on Account, he noted that it was the SLFP which suffered the most from the recent political crisis.
“We do not expect portfolios. We will remain in the Opposition. Our support is to take this country forward. The UNP’s Gamperaliya programme is a good move. Recent political issues created many problems in the country.The tourism sector and investments were badly affected.
The country suffered a huge loss during those few days. All condemn the misbehaviour of MPs’in the House,” he said.
Amaraweera also regretted the crossover of MP Vijith Vijayamuni Soysa, adding that they were seniors in the SLFP and the SLFP should have retained them in the party.
“We have to correct our wrongs. We will support the good moves of the Government while objecting to what is bad for the country. Take our criticisms in good spirit,” he told the UNP MPs.
