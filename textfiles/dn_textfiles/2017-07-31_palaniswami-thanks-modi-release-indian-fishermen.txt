Palaniswami thanks Modi for release of Indian fishermen

Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami thanked Prime Mi­nister Narendra Modi’s intervention to secure the release of 75 fisherm­en and 42 fishing boats in Sri Lankan custody. 
He urged the Prime Minister however to ensure the release of 107 more fishing boats still in Sri Lanka.
“On behalf of the people of Tamil Nadu, I thank you for your personal intervention and sincere efforts which have enabled the release of the fishermen and the boats,” the CM said in his letter to Modi on Saturday.
The State received communication from the External Affairs Ministry about the release of 42 boats even before Prime Minister returned after inaugurating former president APJ Abdul Kalam’s memorial on July 27, said Palaniswami.
A court in Sri Lanka had ordered the release of 75 men, he added.
Palaniswami urged Modi to instruct Sri Lanka to secure the release of the remaining 107 boats, which are languishing in Lankan custody to ensure there was adequate reciprocity to various measures taken by the Centre and State governments to resolve the vexatious issue.
