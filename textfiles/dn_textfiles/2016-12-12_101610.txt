Call to regulate trishaw industry

All Island Three Wheeler Drivers Association Chairman Lalith Dharmasekera said it is not fair for the government to impose heavy fines without intervening to regulate the three-wheeler industry.
"We have appealed to the government several times to regulate the three-wheeler industry. But, this has not been done. There is a Gazette notification on the standards of the three-wheelers. But the government is not even implementing it. In addition the registration of three-wheelers has not been properly regulated by the government. Without enforcing those, it is not correct for the government to impose heavy fines,” he added. "It is not correct to impose various laws without differentiating between three-wheeler drivers who run hires and drivers who use three-wheelers for their personal purposes. The government should ensure the professional status and protection of the three-wheeler drivers," he said adding that they support the government decision to impose Rs.25,000 fine on offending drivers and drivers should not strike over that.
"The government should provide immediate solutions for the problems persisting in the industry. The bus operators and three-wheeler operators should not have engaged in a strike but they should have discussed their grievances with the authorities to regulate their respective industries. The government has already created a public opinion on the increase of the fine. Therefore, we must make the people aware of our problems,” he added.
