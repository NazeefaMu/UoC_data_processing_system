Lanka PropertyWeb.com   celebrates 10th anniversary

Lanka PropertyWeb.com, a leading property website in Sri Lanka recently celebrated its 10th anniversary by orchestrating the most successful property focused show in Sri Lanka to-date.
The show was held at Hilton Residences on February 17 and 18. The show featured a plethora of the latest luxury apartments and villas, previews of new property launches and presented the guests with an opportunity to meet some of the finest developers in the country displaying their latest projects.
The event was launched under the patronage of Ministers Ravi Karunanayake, Patali Champika Ranwaka and Susil Premajayanth.
Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka commended the efforts of Lanka Property Web for organizing this venture with plans of promoting the property development and real estate market in the country in his speech and stated that more than 30% of the country’s economy comprises of the revenue from the real estate sector.
Calls for better regulation of agents and developers by Chairmen and CEOs from leading real estate companies were the highlight during one of the panel discussions held. The novel idea of having panel discussions and seminars during a property show in Sri Lanka showed that there’s a big demand to gain knowledge about the industry by the public, with the discussions being oversubscribed and many having to be unfortunately turned away.
The two-day event saw industry experts gather to discuss about the future of the residential and commercial property market and also discuss about the latest status of mega development projects such as Port City and Megapolis.
Managing Director of Lanka Property Web thanked the Ministers for attending the opening despite their busy schedule and said that this was a big encouragement for the property industry of the county to see 3 ministers attending such a function.
He further stated that during the ten years of its formation the website has become the no.1 property website in the country in terms of ads and visits and they will be true to their founding vision in the years to come – to be the easiest and fastest place to find, sell and rent property in Sri Lanka.
