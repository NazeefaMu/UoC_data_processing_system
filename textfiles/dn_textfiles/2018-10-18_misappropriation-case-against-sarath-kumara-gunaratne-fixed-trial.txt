Misappropriation case against Sarath Kumara Gunaratne fixed for trial

The case filed against former Deputy Minister Sarath Kumara Gunaratne and five others for allegedly misappropriating Rs.11.2 million of public funds was yesterday fixed for trial by the Colombo High Court.
The accused are charged with misappropriating Rs. 11.2 million allocated for the Negombo Lagoon Development Project by utilising the funds for former President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s Presidential Election campaign.
When the case came up before High Court Judge Shashi Mahendran, the matter was fixed for trial on December 12.
Meanwhile, the High Court issued an order directing the Secretary to the President that the report pertaining to the Presidential Investigation Commission inquiry into this incident be tendered in court on the next date.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against the six accused including former Fisheries Deputy Minister Sarath Kumara Gunaratne, his son-in-law Upul Chaminda Kumarasinghe, Ceylon Fisheries Harbour Corporation’s (CFHC) former chairman Upali Liyanage, its former General Manager Piyal Abeysekara, Chandana Pelpita and Lakmina Munidasa under the Public Property Act for the alleged misappropriation of Rs.11.2 million belonging to the CFHC during the 2015 Presidential Election.
The Attorney General alleged that the accused had committed six offences under the Public Property Act, between November 20, 2014 and January 7, 2015.
