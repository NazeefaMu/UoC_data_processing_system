Several amendments related to H’tota agreement submitted to Cabinet

Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said that several amendments which were incorporated in the Hambantota Magampura Port agreement and signed last Saturday were submitted to Cabinet yesterday, allowing Ministers to further study them. It will be presented to Parliament next week.
When the agreement was presented at yesterday’s Cabinet meeting, the President taking into account the current situation said that the Ministers should be given at least one week to study the agreement.
The Minister said so at a press conference held at the SLFP Headquarters, yesterday.
“These amendments were presented to the Cabinet by me before signing the agreement and they were included in the signed agreement. The signed agreement will be further discussed in the Cabinet on August 8 and thereafter, presented to Parliament during the same week,” he said.
Three amendments were approved in Cabinet yesterday, among which the proposal presented by President Maithripala Sirisena, allowing the government to revise the agreement at any time. The Finance Ministry also proposed the amendment which noted that all parties should abide by all clauses in the agreement. Two other amendments were presented by the Attorney General’s Department.
“We have decided to give one week for MPs to study the agreement on the request by the President and then they can present some fruitful proposals during the debate in Parliament... Even though, the government was ready for the debate during last week, the Joint Opposition sabotaged it intentionally. Now they distort the facts of the agreement by presenting various false details. That’s why the President has given them a week to study the agreement,” he added.
He said, the Hambantota Port was constructed with an investment of Rs. 193 billion through commercial loans obtained by the Sri Lankan government and the annual loan repayment for SLPA is around Rs. 9.1 billion. But the project was completed only by 20 percent and at the end of 2016, the accumulated loss was over Rs. 46.7 billion. Only 10 ships have been handled by the Hambantota Port by July this year, while only 14 ships were handled in last year. He further said, continuous losses were threatening the survival and continuity of SLPA.
“That is why the government decided to amend the agreement to lease out the Hambantota harbour to a Chinese company for 99 years, in which Sri Lanka will have 30 percent ownership and China Merchants Company (CMP) will have 70 percent ownership. The agreed investment value was USD 1.12 billion,” he said.
Under the previous agreement signed by the Mahinda Rajapaksa government, the treasury did not receive a cent. But according to Minister Samarasinghe, the transactional value will remain at USD 1.12 billion, as per frame work agreement and USD 973 million will be received by the Treasury. The remaining USD 146 million will be invested in the Hambanthota Port.
Our foreign reserve will be increased gradually due to this endeavor, resulting the strong economy. He said that employees of the Hambantota Port were aware of this situation and that is why they did not go on any strike.
Commenting on the statement made by former Minister Basil Rajapaksa, who has urged the government to nationalize the Hambantota port, the Minister said that Basil Rajapaksa has forgotten how he sold the plot of land outright to Shangri-La.
