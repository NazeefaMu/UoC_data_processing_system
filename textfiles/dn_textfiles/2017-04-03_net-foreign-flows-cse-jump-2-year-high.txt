Point of view
Markets reverted five consecutive weeks of W-o-W losses this week as the Bourse bottomed-out from its over-sold position aided largely by foreign investors & HNIs. Despite hitting a 1-year low of 5974.9 points on Monday, the benchmark index recovered ~87 points over the week to close ~61 points above the key psychological barrier of 6000 points.
Average turnover levels too reflected similar positive momentum, averaging a 4-week high of LKR 1.21Bn, ~40% higher than the Y-T-D average turnover level of LKR 0.73Bn, and 29% higher than last weeks’ average turnover level of LKR 0.86Bn.
The revived market momentum stemmed partially from HNI and Institutional buying interest which contributed to 37% of the market turnover amid strong interest in counters as JKH (41% of the crossings) & Sunshine Holdings (33% of the crossings).
Significant foreign interest was also a major contributor to momentum, and the net foreign position on the bourse improved for the 9th consecutive week, with net buying increasing 38% W-o-W to end at LKR 1.82Bn.
Foreign inflows to the CSE have remained largely consistent since Jul’16 (excluding a brief outflow in Jan), hitting a >2-year high of LKR 4.6Bn in Mar’17.
Net inflows to the CSE over Q1’17 was LKR 4.6Bn (cf. an outflow of LKR 2.2Bn in Q1’16) as fund flows towards EM/FM assets have resumed as the recovery in the global economy has relieved earlier pessimism over the potential for the new U.S. administration to impose protectionist trade policies1.
Markets in the week ahead are likely to maintain similar positive direction.
Urban inflation in March hits a high of 7.3%
Urban inflation levels in March rose to a high of 7.3% Y-o-Y (cf. 6.8% Y-o-Y in Feb), mainly driven by base effects from low inflation in March 2016.
While both Food and Non-food inflation contributed to the Y-o-Y increase in headline inflation in March, food inflation declined M-o-M over March (-0.7%) while non-food inflation rose marginally (+0.1%) over the month.
Given that the impact from tax-structure adjustments should wane over the coming months and assuming the prevailing drought conditions ease, inflation is expected to revert back to mid-single digits over the near-term.
The CBSL last week raised policy rates ~25bps as a ‘precautionary move’ in order to contain inflation expectations and demand side inflationary pressures.
However, the Monetary Authority raised policy rates by 25bps (as opposed to the widely anticipated 50bps) citing improved fiscal conditions and the upward adjustment that has already occurred in market rates.
The CBSL’s delivery of a lower-than-expected rate hike and less hawkish tone in its policy statement thus implies that growth remains a concern and that the CBSL is unlikely to raise rates further if they can shore-up additional FX reserves and inflation remains within the IMF-recommended targets.
