JAXPORT enhances service to Asia

The US Jacksonville Port Authority (JAXPORT) has expanded its service to Asia as part of Hamburg Süd’s new Asia – North America East Coast rotation.
JAXPORT’s Blount Island Marine Terminal now serves as the last port of call for the container shipping company’s service which is offered through the 2M Alliance.
Vessels in the rotation offer service from Jacksonville to Busan in South Korea as well as Qingdao, Xingang, Shanghai and Ningbo in China.
“The Asian container trade continues to be the fastest growing segment of JAXPORT’s container cargo business, achieving 19 percent growth in 2016,” JAXPORT said.
In February, JAXPORT renewed an agreement with the Panama Canal Authority (ASP) pledging to continue working to market the advantages of shipping cargo between Asia and JAXPORT through the Panama Canal.
