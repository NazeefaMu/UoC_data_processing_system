Range Bandara's bribery claim baseless - Keheliya

Government Co-Spokesman MP Keheliya Rambukwella dismissed claims made by MP Range Bandara during a meeting held at a committee room in Parliament yesterday that he was offered a bribe to support the new government.
Rambukwella dismissed the claim as baseless and utterly false.
Responding to a query by the Daily News during a press briefing at the Prime Minister’s Office yesterday, he said if such an attempt had been made to bribe him, he should have first lodged a complaint instead of merely talking about it.
“If somebody is announcing that somebody had offered him a bribe, as a citizen its his duty to go and lodge a complaint with the names etc. anybody can make allegations or claims but that becomes authentic if you go and make a complaint and prove your claims. He should have made a complaint with the CID as this is a huge amount of money he is talking about.
Just somebody announcing that he was offered such a huge amount is baseless. Knowing Range Bandara and his capacity, I don’t expect such actions from him,” Rambukwella said.
