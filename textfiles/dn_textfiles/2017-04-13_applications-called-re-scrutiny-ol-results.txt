Applications called for re-scrutiny of O/L results

Applications for the re-scrutiny of the G.C.E Ordinary Level examination 2016 results, will be accepted by the Examinations Department until April 30.
Applications submitted after April 30 will not be considered, Examinations Department sources said.
