OPPO F7 Youth full screen AI Beauty smartphone launched

OPPO, the smartphone brand worldwide launched F7 Youth. Crafted for young users to enjoy the beauty of technology, the smartphone features highly rated AI Beauty 2.0 Technology as well as a Super Full Screen.
F7 Youth is available in three colours Sunrise Red, Moonlight Silver, and Diamond Black and will be available through offline stores.
Bob Li, CEO, OPPO Lankasaid, “The F7 Youth was specially designed with young users in mind. Today’s youth delight in creative self-expression and the AI Beauty 2.0 Technology powered F7 will help them excel at doing so.”
Youth are fascinated with trends that express their individualities as they seek to live their own life. Beauty technology from OPPO, popularized by the F7 model, is already a hit with young consumers. Likewise, the same AI 2.0 Beauty Technology is included in F7 Youth, acting as a personal beauty artistto customize beauty based on your unique facial features so that your photos will “capture the real you”.
Also, OPPO F7 Youth aims to satisfy the need for photo editing and social sharing. It includes fun and exciting functions that allow youth to take various kinds of selfies. For example, F7 Youth comes with its own AR Sticker function and is immediately available for use without the need to download any app.
OPPO designers revamped the design to build the phone using “art symmetry”, thus avoiding messy detail and patterns that cut off the camera and logo.
The back cover of F7 Youth uses a 12-layer nanometer scale optical coating composite material that is carefully polished and crafted to create a shiny and luxurious metallic luster at the back.
Arising in 2018, the Notch screen has become the mainstream configuration for mobile phones, but OPPO uncovered some pain points that young users have. When they are busy gaming, they are forced to sign out to reply to messages their friends have sent via social media channels.
Now, the Super Full Screen together with Full Screen Multitasking in F7 Youth gives young people a more intuitive full screen experience.
To improve comfort when using the phone, ColorOS 5.0 UI has been completely revamped to be more dynamic, whether it is in the overall colors, background or font design.
Overall, the feel of the system is greatly enhanced but it’s not just aesthetics, security in ColorOS 5.0 has also been improved.
