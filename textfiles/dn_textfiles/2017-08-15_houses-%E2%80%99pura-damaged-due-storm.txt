Houses in A’pura damaged due to storm

A large number of houses in several areas of Anuradhapura were damaged due to strong winds which accompanied heavy showers following a prolonged drought, yesterday.
The Kahatagasdigiliya Divisional Secretariat too, was partially damaged. At least 23 houses in four Grama Niladhari Disvisions in the Kahatagasdigiliya area were damaged due to heavy winds.
There was a disruption to the town’s electricity supply as falling trees damaged power lines.
Traffic too came to a standstill for several hours along the Anuradhapura–Horowpatana main road due to large trees falling across the road.
