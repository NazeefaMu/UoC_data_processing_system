A French affair at The Kingsbury

The Kingsbury has hosted expert Chef Eric Berrigaud from France to give you the opportunity to savour the French cuisines until June 28 at The Ocean Seafood Restaurant. Chef Berrigaud is a native of the Brittany region in France and his illustrious 33 year career has seen him travel the world. A special five course menu with perfectly paired wines featuring Eric’s signature specialties are yours to experience.
An excited Chef Berrigaud stated in a press release that he is looking forward to have a culinary adventure in Sri Lanka and what better place than The Kingsbury, Colombo.
“I am excited to work with one of the best culinary teams in Sri Lanka and bring in my knowledge and experience to the kitchen. Guests are in for an absolute treat!,” he further stated.
Chef Berrigaud will also be curating special menu at The Grill from June 29 to July 8 and an Italian Tapas menu at the Honey Beach Club from July 9 to 18.
