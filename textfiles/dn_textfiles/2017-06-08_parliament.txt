 JO playing opportunistic politics: Kiriella
The opportunistic politics that the Joint Opposition(JO) indulges is clearly visible by the fact that its leader makes statements against the SAITM while the gazette of the same medical faculty had been presented by him during the previous regime, Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella said in Parliament yesterday.
He said that it was Parliamentarian Dinesh Gunawardena who presented the gazette of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) on December 11, 2013.
“It was set up in 2009 and University Grant Commission had accepted it in 2011 as an institution which conducts courses for MBBS,” Minister Kiriella said.
“The previous government granted a loan of Rs.600 million and granted scholarships to follow medicine courses. But now MP Gunawardena is speaking against the same.
This is clearly the opportunistic politics maintained by the JO”.
Minister Kiriella made these observations in response to a special statement made by MP
Dinesh Gunawardena under Standing Orders 23 stating that continuing with the SAITM as a medical faculty was illegal and it was set up as an institute of technology and management.
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara questioned as to how scholarships were granted to SAITM for medicine if it were a Technology and Management institute.
Minister Kiriella further said that the Mahapola scholarship could not be granted to those medical students who stage Satyagraha without attending the university lectures.
“Former Minister Lalith Athulathmudali introduced the Mahapola Scholarship for University students,” Minister Kiriella said.
“Does Gunawardena ask to grant scholarships to the students who don’t attend the university. We can’t grant Mahapola Scholarships to those who don’t attend university,”the Minister said.
At this stage, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said that the request to grant Mahapola scholarship to the students who don’t attend the university tantamount to paying Parliamentary attending allowances to those MPs who don’t attend parliamentary sittings.
Akila vows stern action against corrupt Archaeological Dept. officials
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said he would take stern action against some more officials in the Archaeological Department, who were allegedly involved in corrupt acts over the past years.
The minister made this comment while making a special Ministerial Statement in Parliament yesterday on the removal of Dr. Senerath Dissanayake from the post of Director General of Archaeological Department.
The minister said Dr.Dissanayake who was the Archaeological Department DG for 13 years
from 2004 has to take the responsibility for the present plight of the archaeological heritage in the country.
He said Dissanayake’s removal was a collective Cabinet decision, adding that he (Dissanayake) has been given space to reply to the charge sheet sent to him.
He said the DG has done little to stop unauthorized constructions in world heritage sites such as Galle Fort and Dambulla Cave temple, adding that the UNESCO warned of removing them from the World Heritage status due to this reason.
He also said the Department has failed to properly identify and mark the boundaries of archaeological sites in the North and East eventhough eight have lapsed since the terrorist war ended. He said the recent trend of the destruction of archaeological sites’ was due to the absence of proper conversation mechanism.
“About 80 percent of the high ranking posts in the Department have not been filled for many years. The inefficiency of the Department is proven beyond doubt. I have no personal dispute with the DG. Several newspapers and web based media carried false news over the decision to remove Dissanayake. I have not made any request to release any land coming under the Archaeological Department for any construction,” the minister clarified.
The minister said Prof P B Mandawala has been appointed as acting DG of the Archaeological Department.
Sports Act to be reintroduced as a new Act: Minister
The Sports Act will be reintroduced as a completely new Act, said Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara in Parliament yesterday. The Minister made this observation moving orders under the Sports Act.
He also said that some outdated provisions needed to be updated while important changes needed to be made to the act to meet the needs of the present. He added that a committee has been appointed for the task.
He also said the new Act would ensure the independence of sports associations and seek to eliminate political influences over Sports associations.
He pointed out that as a result, Sports Associations would have financial responsibilities and will have to be managed in a transparent manner.
He added that recommendations and advice had been sought from the International Olympic
Committee as well as the Sri Lanka Olympic Committee on methods to improve the Sports Act.
He also said that the existing Sports Act had been passed in 1963 and it should be changed.
Fill GN officer vacancies based on competitive examination results: Anura Kumara
Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake queried as to why the Government is not filling the existing Grama Niladari(GN) Officer vacancies based on the results of competitive examination held last year.
He charged while those who sat for the competitive exam were waiting their results for months, the Government has made plans to recall the retired Grama Niladari Officers back to service.
The MP was raising a question under Standing Order 23 (2) in Parliament yesterday.
“About 180,000 candidates sat for the exam held in September last year. The Examinations Department had completed marking the papers by April, but the Home Affairs Ministry has not taken the results from the Department,” he said.
“In the meantime, the Minister’s private secretary has been collecting recommendation letters from UNP Parliamentarians to fill the existing vacancies from retired Grama Niladari Officers. This is unfair for those who sat for the exam. These political recommendations are not suitable for the independence of the post of Grama Niladari Officer. The Government should immediately abandon this plan,” MP Dissanayake said.
Replying to this question Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena said the extension of services of retiring Grama Niladari Officers was proposed in view of the recent disaster in the country. “About 5,700 Grama Niladari Divisions out of 14,000 were affected by the recent disaster situation. Therefore we decided to extend the service of retiring officers for another three months. However, once an appointment is made based on the competitive exam, the service of those retired officers will be cancelled,” he said.
The minister said the delay in recruiting persons based on the exam was due to a proposal of Grama Niladari Officers’ Associations to consider filling 50 percent of the existing vacancies with males and rest of 50 percent with females.
“The Association came up with this request stating that about 80 percent of individuals who would be selected from the exam would be female. Our ministry was not inclined towards this proposal as we were of the view that gender based recruitment was not suitable and that the recruitment should be based on the marks only,” the minister explained.
The minister said there are 1,725 vacancies in the Grama Niladari Officer cadre as of May 30. However, MP Dissanayake said he could not agree with the reply of the Minister that the decision to recruit the retired Grama Niladari Officers was due to the disaster.
“The letter communicating this decision was issued in April 24. The flood havoc came in May. Going by the reply of the minister, he seems to have foreseen the disaster. If that is so, the minister is best suited to hold the Disaster Management portfolio,” the MP remarked.
Heated argument between Speaker, JO
A heated argument broke out between Joint Opposition(JP) members and Speaker Karu Jayasuriya in Parliament yesterday following the special statement made by JO Parliamentary Group leader Dinesh Gunawardena.
As the Joint Opposition
members started to shout when the Speaker announced that nobody could be allowed to express their views other than the member who moved the special statement under Standing Order 23 (2) and the responding Minister, the Speaker warned the members that he would have to name members.
“I will have to name member Ranjith de Soysa if you keep on threatening and pointing your finger at the Chair,” warned the Speaker. “This is not a Pradeshiya Sabha to act in a such a manner. All the members who were on their feet should sit down. All members should realiase the fact that this is an august assembly,”Speaker Jayasuriya said. When MP Dinesh Gunawardena refuted the response by Minister Kiriella that the Gazette of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) had been presented to Parliament by MP Gunawardena, Minister Kiriella sent a copy of the Hanzard to the Speaker/. The Speaker said that the copy was the proceedings of the Parliamentary sittings of December 11, 2013.
MP Gunawardena moving the special statement said that around 6,000 medical students in government medical faculties boycott the lectures as the government has failed to fulfill their demand to ensure a process of producing quality doctors. He added that their boycott of lectures has reached 500 days which they started against the SAITM.
He questioned if the government would heed the medical students’ demand and to grant the Mahapola Scholarship which has been held to those medical students.
After Minister Kiriella’s response, MP Gunawardena said that the SAITM Medical Faculty was illegal and same is not accepted by Minister Kiriella.
Point Pedro to house country’s largest fisheries harbour: Minister Amaraweera
The largest fisheries harbour in the country will come up in Point Pedro, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
The minister made this comment while replying to a question by UPFA MP Douglas Devananda under Standing Order 23 (2) in Parliament yesterday.
The minister said two fisheries harbours would be built in Pesali and Point Pedro to develop the fisheries industry in the North.
He said the Asian Development Bank has agreed to provide funds for this project.
“Prior to 1983, there was about 40 percent contribution from the Northern fishermen to the local fish production. It drastically dropped to 4 percent from 1983 to 2009 due to war,” he said.
“This contribution is about 12 percent as of today and this is not satisfactory. The fishermen in the North are still using traditional fishing methods and their vessels are very old. Compared with the South, the fishing industry in the North is lagging behind 20-30 years. Now we are transferring modern technology to them,” he said.
He added a team from the Moratuwa University recently carried out a feasibility study in Point Pedro on the proposed construction.
Replying to MP Devananda’s question over public protests on the proposed project, the minister said he would visit the area and hold discussions with the people on resolving their issues concerning the project.
“Our officials discussed with the fisheries association representatives and they could iron out most of their doubts. Now many in the area are supporting this project. If we have to acquire private lands for the purpose, we will pay due compensation. The Construction of fishery harbour will generate a large number of direct and indirect jobs. We do not intend to recruit those in the South for them. It is the Northern community who will be fully benefited by this initiative,” the minister explained.
The minister also said the proposed Aquaculture Industrial Park extending to about 3,000 acres in Mannar would generate about 10,000 jobs.
Country to ban tobacco cultivation from 2020, says Rajitha
Tobacco cultivation will be completely banned in the country from 2020, Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr.Rajitha Senaratne said.
The minister was responding to a question by UNP MP Buddhika Pathirana in Parliament yesterday. The minister, observing that about 30,000 persons are currently involved in tobacco cultivation, said a programme is in place to introduce alternative crops to them.
He said the sale of cigarettes within a 500 metre radius of schools would also be banned, adding that the Cabinet approved the proposal in this regard recently.
Minister Senaratne added the sale of single cigarettes would also be banned shortly, adding that this proposal also received the Cabinet approval.
“Thereafter,if anybody wants to buy a cigarette, he should buy a carton. Plain packaging will also be introduced in the near future.
All these steps are intended to discourage smoking. Sri Lanka received the accolades of the World Health Organisation for the stiff action taken by the Government to discourage smoking,” he said.
The minister further said tobacco and liquor companies are not allowed to carry out Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) projects as per the National Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol (NATA) Act. However, he pointed out steps to discourage liquor consumption should be initiated by the Finance Ministry, as it falls under the Finance Ministry’s purview.
Susanthika instructed to submit a progress report on payment: Sports Minister
Sprinter Susanthika Jayasinghe has been instructed to submit a progress report that is required to continue the payment that she is paid as an adviser to the Sports Ministry, Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara told Parliament yesterday.
He said that submission of the report is compulsory and the Audit is querying as to why and how she is being paid without the report being submitted by her.
“This has been misunderstood by some,” the Minister said.
“However she has been instructed to meet the additional Secretary (Administration) and to submit the report in order to get her payment. She is being paid Rs 60,000 from the Sports Ministry and another Rs 60,000 from the Sri Lanka Army. The Government is paying her a sum of Rs. 120,000 to Susanthika Jayasinghe.”
The Minister also said that he was of the view that Susanthika should be paid a pension as the members suggested. “And there are other athletes such as Sriyani Kulawansa, Damayanthi Darsha, Sugath Thilakaratne, etc who have obtained medals at the Asian Games and Commonwealth Games which is also a great achievement,” Minister Jayasekara said.
He also said that the proposal to grant a vehicle permit could be considered. The Minister made these observations yesterday in response to members who spoke on the orders under the Sports Act.
The Minister said that 100 sports graduates would be recruited in future. “There is a programme to develop sports in schools,” he said.
The Ministry is getting ready for the Asian and Commonwealth Games. The athletes in the pool are being trained. They are provided with food and payments.
He added that there is a plan to develop the Diyagama Stadium and Rs.500 million has been allocated for this purpose.
