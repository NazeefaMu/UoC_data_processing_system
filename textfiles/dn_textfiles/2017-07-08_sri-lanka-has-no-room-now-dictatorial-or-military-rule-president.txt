Sri Lanka has no room now for dictatorial or military rule: President

President Maithripala Sirisena says it was a dictatorial, military rule he ended on January 8, 2015 and the country has no any room for such a rule again.
The President was speaking at a ceremony held on Thursday to open the newly built administration building at the Irrigation Training Institute in Galgamuwa.
“The people today has understood the conspiracies by some persons to come into power by showing a fantasy world,” he said.
“The government is ready to reveal the fraud and corruption committed by the persons in the pretext of development. They are fabricating fairytale on the development while trying to convince that the current government is an incapable, failed government,” he said.
The President said a cheque worth billions related to the Gin-Nilwala Ganga Project had been issued on January 7, 2015, a day before the Presidential Election, when no government office was working. “Some persons challenged us to reveal if any fraud had been occurred. By now the matters regarding the fraud were revealed. We can show the people what happened to that money,” the President said. He said the Uma Oya Project, which commenced according to political decisions without any capacity evaluation, devastated the country.
“Everybody should get together not to change the government, but to free the country and the people from poverty, free the country from the millions worth credit burden created by the former government and take the country towards development,” the President said.
“I have a humble happiness that the media today can criticise the government and anybody can protest freely,” he said.
“Every political party spoke about the water requirement to Wayamba. But it is the current government that resolved thet issue through the Moragahakanda Project. The Wayamba Ela Project and the Moragahakanda reservoir will result in renovating over 300 tanks in the Kurunegala district. It will transform the irrigation sector and the lives of the people in the district,” he said.
The President opened the building and inspected the premises.
He registered three students for the Irrigation Training Institute by symbolizing the admission of students to the institute.
The diploma holders received certificates from the President. Ministers Dayasiri Jayasekara, Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, State Ministers Palitha Range Bandara, T. B. Ekanayake, Deputy Ministers Naranath Basnayake, Indika Bandaranayake, Wayamba Province Chief Minister Dharmasiri Dassanayake, Provincial Ministers Lakshman Wendaruwa, Shantha Bandara, Galgamuwa UNP Organiser Mohan Perera and the Irrigation Training Institute Director Engineer K.B.V.
