Drastic reforms to police force – Sagala Ratnayaka

Making a shocking revelation, Minister of Law and Order and Southern Development Sagala Ratnayaka admitted on popular social media platform Twitter that fundamentals on quelling tensions and operating guidelines may have been compromised during the Kataragama shooting.
The Minister was referring to an incident where a motorcyclist was shot dead by a police constable on Wedihitikanda Road in Kataragama town for allegedly failing to stop the vehicle for inspection. The incident sparked protests resulting in the arrests of several individuals. The shooting prompted a probe directed by Inspector General of Police (IGP) Pujith Jayasundera who ordered a special team from the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to investigate the fatal shooting.
“Police themselves are subject to law. When quelling a tense situation or an unruly demonstration, justifiable force should be used, in strict adherence to operating guidelines. It appears to be that these fundamentals have not been followed in relation to Kataragama incident,” the Minister said yesterday.
Inferring reforms of Sri Lanka Police, the Minister went on to add that the “Kataragama incident is not an isolated one. This stems from lack of training and professionalism. Failure to address core issues diligently will throw us into similar situations time and time again. So, drastic reforms will soon be introduced to Police with help of foreign experts.”
The Minister also added that he has communicated to the Secretary of the Ministry and IGP at a special meeting for action to be initiated against those responsible for the Kataragama incident.
