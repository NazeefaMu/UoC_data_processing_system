EC to finalise female members to LG Councils this week

The Election Commission will finalize the number of female members elected to Local Government bodies from each party within this week, Additional Election Commissioner M. H. M. Mohammad said yesterday.
Accordingly, the numbers will be then forwarded to all the General Secretaries of respective political parties by the end of this week, he said.
The General Secretaries will then have to provide a list of their nominated members to the Election Commission on dates notified, he added.
When inquired on the issue relating to maintaining the female representation at 25 percent, Mohammad said it is a matter which should be resolved by the respective political parties.
“We are here to inform them as to how many female members they should nominate. We will let them know how many members they will need to nominate to maintain the 25 percent female representation according to law. It is up to them to nominate the correct number of members,” he said.
Meanwhile, a special party leaders' meeting was held on Monday which carried out an extensive discussion over the issues arisen in setting up the LG bodies, 25 percent female representation and appointing members to the Councils.
Mahajana Eksath Peramuna Leader MP Dinesh Gunawardena said that there was no final decision arrived at the meeting with regard to the 25 percent female representation. However, several options were weighed down to form and function the LG Councils and abide by the law at the same time.
He said that Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya who took part in the meeting, explained the present issues related to maintaining the 25 percent female representation and finalizing the appointment of Council members.
Several possibilities and options to overcome these issues were discussed at the meeting, he said.
“For example, there are instances where a political party is not bound to nominate any females whereas another party has to nominate a considerable number,” Gunawardena said. Thus, several possibilities were discussed to overcome this issue to make sure it would be fair to everybody, he pointed out.
