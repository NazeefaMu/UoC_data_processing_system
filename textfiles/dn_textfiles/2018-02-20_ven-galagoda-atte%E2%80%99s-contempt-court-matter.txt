Ven. Galagoda Atte’s contempt of court matter

The Court of Appeal hearing the contempt of court action filed against Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera over his alleged offensive behaviour inside the Homagama Magistrate’s Court yesterday fixed further trial for February 27.
In a surprising turn of events, on January 25, 2016 Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera began to address Open Court after the court hearing pertaining to the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda was over.
Later on, Gnanasara Thera was arrested by police on the charges of contempt of court, obstructing Court proceedings and intimidating a public servant. Former Homagama Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake had referred this Contempt of Court action to the Court of Appeal since it is vested with powers to inquire about such a complaint.
Through this contempt of Court action, the Homagama Magistrate has sought the Appeal Court’s jurisdiction to consider whether the alleged offensive behaviour and utterance of Ven. Gnanasara Thera inside the Court amounts to Contempt of Court.
He further sought the Court’s jurisdiction to take necessary legal action against Ven. Gnanasara Thera if the charges leveled against him amounts to Contempt of Court.
On a previous occasion, the Attorney General filed the amended charge sheet comprising four counts alleging that the accused had committed a punishable offence which comes under Article 105 of the Constitution.
