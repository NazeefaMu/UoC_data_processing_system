‘State medical students face new challenge’

State medical students faced a more serious issue than SAITM, and that was the priority given to money rather than talent when offering internships, State Medical Students’ Parents’ Union Media Spokesman Wasantha Alwis said.
He was addressing the media in Colombo, yesterday evening.
Top priority should be given to students who had graduated from state medical faculties, while second and third priority should be given to students who had repeated their exams and those who had done their exams abroad, respectively, he said.
