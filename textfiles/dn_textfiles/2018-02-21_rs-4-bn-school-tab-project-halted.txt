Rs. 4 BN school tab project halted

The proposed project to provide tablet computers to GCE Advanced Level students and teachers has been suspended at yesterday’s Cabinet meeting.
Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister John Seneviratne told the Daily News that this proposal was suspended by the President.
The money allocated for the project will most probably be transferred to fund a project targeting poverty stricken rural people in the country.
The Rs.4 billion project was to provide 2000,000 tablet computers to A/L students and teachers around the country. The Cabinet last week approved to purchase a tab at a price of Rs.27,000.
Minister Seneviratne also said the National Economic Council chaired by President Sirisena and its new economic management programme will be introduced by next week.
