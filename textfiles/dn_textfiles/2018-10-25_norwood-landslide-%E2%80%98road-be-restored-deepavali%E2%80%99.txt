Norwood landslide: ‘Road to be restored before Deepavali’

The Hatton - Bogawantalawa road would be restored before Deepavali celebrations commence, Nuwara Eliya Road Development Authority Chief Engineer K.M. Thilakaratna said.
A section of the New Weligama village on the Hatton - Bogawantalawa - Maskeliya road sank into the Castlereigh Reservoir on October 13, disrupting traffic and causing commuters to take alternative routes.
It had been planned to begin reconstruction work a few days ago, but the National Building Construction Organisation (NBRO) had discontinued the work as they believed it would have triggered another landslide.
Nuwara Eliya District Secretary Rohana Pushpa Kumara said that measures were taken to construct a new road near to where the old one was located, after removing loose soil layers.
Residents said that they had to travel an additional three kilometres through tea estates to reach Norwood.
