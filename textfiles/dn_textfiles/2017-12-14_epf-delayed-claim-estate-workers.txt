EPF delayed, claim estate workers

Plantation workers attached to the Rangala and Elkaduwa groups belonging to the State Plantations Corporation who have gone on retirement after a long service, lamented that they encounter difficulties in claiming their Employment Provident Fund (EPF) benefits.
They say this is because the estate managements had failed to properly remit their EPF contributions to the relevant authorities.
A spokesman for the workers’ union, Tissa Gondeniya said the union had now written to the Prime Minister requesting him to intervene in this matter to ensure that EPF is duly paid to these workers.
