No support For Ranil - JVP

JVP Propaganda Secretary and Parliamentarian Vijitha Herath yesterday categorically said his party will not support former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament.
Herath, while denying reports which have gone viral on social media that the JVP would support the former Prime Minister said that his party will only support the immediate reconvening of Parliament, ahead of the present date of November 16.
He said that a news website has published a story citing that the JVP has taken a decision to support former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament when it reconvenes on or before November 16.
“We have not announced that the party has taken a decision to support Wickremesinghe, though the party voted against the No Confidence Motion brought against former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament some time ago,” Herath stressed.
He said that his party is of the view that the present political development is unconstitutional and has to be rectified.
The Parliament should be reconvened as soon as possible to resolve the issue, he added. The Propaganda Secretary added that however his party will stay neutral in Parliament.
The JVP earlier held a rally in Nugegoda urging the President to reconvene Parliament before November 16.
