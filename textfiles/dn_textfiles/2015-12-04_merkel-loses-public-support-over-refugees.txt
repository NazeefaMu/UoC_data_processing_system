Merkel loses public support over refugees

GERMANY: Almost half of German voters do not want Angela Merkel to serve another term as chancellor, according to a poll.
Some 48 per cent of those questioned in the survey for Bild newspaper said they would not want Merkel to continue in office after the next German election, due to be held in 2017.
Forty-four per cent were in favour of Mrs Merkel remaining in power.
The findings are an indication of how dramatically Mrs Merkel's public support has fallen in recent weeks following opposition to her "open-door" refugee policy.
Just a few months ago, her leadership seemed unassailable, and her Christian Democrat party was even daring to contemplate the possibility of an overall majority in 2017.
Mrs Merkel is not facing disaster yet. Despite the drop in her support she has no obvious challenger, and her party remains well ahead in the polls, at 38 per cent, one point up from a week ago. Its nearest rival, the Social Democrats, are 13 points behind on 25 per cent.
But the latest poll found 47 per cent of voters believed Mrs Merkel had handled the refugee crisis badly, and 44 per cent thought she had done well.
The chancellor has refused to back down from her policy or impose a limit on the number of asylum seekers the country will take.
Some 950,000 are believed to have entered so far this year, considerably more than the official government forecast of 800,000.
Germany's top defence official has said 1,200 soldiers may be sent to the Middle East by the end of the year to provide service support in the fight against Isil.
Volker Wieker said Merkel saw a bigger German role as the price to pay for Francois Hollande's support in tackling the refugee crisis.
