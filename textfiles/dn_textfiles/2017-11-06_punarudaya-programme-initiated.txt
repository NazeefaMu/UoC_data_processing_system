Punarudaya programme initiated

The 'Punarudaya' National Environment Conservation programme implemented by the Land Use and Policy Department under the aegis of the Development and Special Projects Unit of the Presidential Secretariat, is now being carried out in the Thawalama DS division.
Several micro water catchment areas in the Ela Ihala, and Ela Ihala North GS divisions in Thawalama have been selected for this programme by the Land Use and Planning Unit of the Thawalama Divisional Secretariat. These areas would be developed with land soil conservation and planted with cinnamon and pepper.
The necessary planting material will be provided to a group of ten cultivation lands under a programme, which is co-ordinated by the Galle District Office of the Land Use and Planning Department and the Thawalama Divisional Secretariat. Advisory services will be pounded by officers of the Export Agriculture Department and land Use and Planning Officers.
