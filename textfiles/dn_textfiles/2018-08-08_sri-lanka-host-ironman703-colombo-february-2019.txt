Sri Lanka to host IronMan70.3 Colombo in February 2019

The most iconic high profile international triathlon event IronMan 70.3 Colombo will be staged for the second consecutive year in Sri Lanka on February 24, 2019. The official licencee of the World Triathlon Corporation and owner of the IronMan global triathlon brand in Sri Lanka, ProAm Serendib will conduct the event in collaboration with Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau and the Ministry of Tourism.
The first edition of IronMan 70.3 Colombo was a success and took place in the country early this year attracting over 880 participants and around 2,300 friends and families from 63 countries.
This challenging event will start with a 1.9 km open water swim off Galle Face Green, followed by a 3-lap flat 90 km bike leg through the Colombo Port and ending with a 21.1 km run passing through some of Colombo’s landmarks and finishing at Galle Face Green.
Athletes enjoyed the races where they were exposed to flawless tropical weather conditions whilst enjoying some of the islands most spectacular views en route.
A majority of the participants were recorded from Europe with 40 percent having taken part in the first edition while other participants hailed from countries such as the USA, Canada, Middle East, Australia, African countries and North East and South East Asian countries.
Pro-Am Serendib is geared to hold this prestigious international sporting event in Sri Lanka and it happens to be the only IronMan event in the South Asian region. It provides an opportunity to build local capability and capacity to host international multisport endurance sporting events in Sri Lanka.
IronMan triathlon is a global phenomenon with a 40-year history going back to Hawaii. During an awards banquet, a few athletes debated which athletes were the fittest: Swimmers, Bikers or Runners. Later, US Naval Commander John Collins and his wife Judy decided to combine the 3 toughest endurance races in Hawaii—the 2.4 mile (3.8 km) Waikiki Rough water Swim, 112 miles (180 km) Around-O’ahu Cycle Race and the 26.2mile (42.2 km) Honolulu Marathon—into one event.
On Feb.18, 1978, 15 competitors, including Collins, came to the shores of Waikiki to take on the first-ever IronMan challenge. Since the first ever race, the IronMan World Championship race is held in Hawaii in October each year. It is the number one user-based sports brand in the world, with 15 billion media impressions for the IronMan World Championship, a global audience of over 6,000,000 spectators, over 250,000 athletes representing 200 countries, participating at over 250 IronMan branded events globally, which include IronMan and the IronMan 70.3 series.
