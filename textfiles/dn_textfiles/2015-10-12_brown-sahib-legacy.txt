The Brown Sahib legacy

In an intensely segregated society, pluralism and multiculturalism are distantly placed. Segregation of all sorts, ethno/religio/racial /linguistic and what not have a firm grip on the Sri Lankan whole and its common knowledge that the beneficiaries of this tragic phenomenon have been the politicians. Riding on the crest wave of such a divisive network, many in the very creative, self-minded political fraternity on all fronts, have installed themselves in power and built for even unborn generations, massive financial reservoirs that does not warrant any emphasis or elaboration for it is now public knowledge. Social resentment is prevalent of late than in earlier times, with seemingly no solution in the offing, as one corrupt collective is neatly replaced by some other and so goes the carnival if not the circus or still better the perahera.

As the Britisher went about setting up his chosen, well articulated yet arguably morally deviant system worldwide, to suit his economic agenda by whipping up social divisiveness - his offspring and replica as Tarzie Vitachi called the ‘Brown Sahib’, continued from where the British left by fostering identity politics to be in power to acquire riches in their respective countries. As a result an international pecking order exists today where local and international elite collaborate to operationalize a lopsided world political economy.
Religion based schools laid the groundwork for social segregation and divisiveness followed by identity politics. Buddhist, Christian, Hindu and Muslim, schools were great facilitators into such state. The post colonial period saw the entry of foreign missionaries such as Anie Beasant, Marie Museaus, Henry Steele Olcott and the like to name a few, into colonies to establish Buddhist schools. This apart, local communities rallied round their respective community leaders as they opened up schools of their choice with the blessings of Lord Soulbury - the master craftsman of British agenda to educate their respective flock. Incidentally, he built up excellent rapport with these community leaders and convinced them of the need for religion based schools whereby the goal of bringing out a highly divisive social collective was realized.
Foreign Christian missionaries
The foreign Christian missionaries headed the Christian schools perhaps due to a shortfall among the locals to carry out such task as Christianity was at that time a new entrant to the local scene. Buddhist stalwarts like Anagarika Dharmapala, D. B. Jayatilleke and the like coupled with Tamil, Christian and Muslim leaders of that time were much to their liking for they saw in them an excellent opportunity to carve out a highly segregated Ceylonese facilitating the discreetly operative British policy of divide and rule. These leaders were unaware that they were really helping the British in fostering ethnicity, unheard of prior to alien rule despite the presence of diverse ethnic groups from time immemorial. Ironically, soul redemption was not the purpose of these educational institutions though each bore the religious tag. If that was so, the numerous Arahats and saints churned out may have been cheaper by the dozen which points out to Britain's socio/political/economic and religious agenda in initiating these schools! They certainly manoeuvred a highly divided society starting from these varied ethno/religious schools and left it to the local political elite to continue doing the ‘needful.’

Yet, one cannot deny their good work even though tainted by selfish motives. We see this among other things, in their fine road network they completed to facilitate tea exports if not for which we would still be travelling on cart tracks. These macadamized roads were a boon to the mercantilist economy Sri Lanka tasted for the first time though it was totally not devoid of ill effects. Vast stretches of fertile paddy land was ruined with the silt washed down in road building and forest cover clearing that paved the way for the hill country's sprawling tea plantations. The exodus of Indian labour imports to work here further segregated Ceylon's citizenry and much water flowed under the bridge before they were recognized as sons and daughters of this soil. Them being granted citizenship ended in a long drawn furore despite their relentless contribution to this country's financial coffers.
While segregation was encouraged within countries for divide and rule purposes, globally, attempts were made to bring the entire world under a common language, culture, religion. English became the international language, political and not authentic Christianity was initiated as world religion. Islam, its culture and learning, were pushed into the wilderness as the western power travelled far and wide in setting up an unbalanced system of their own.
The creation of the armed forces was to uphold the government in power never mind the corruption whereby a space existed between the rulers and the ruled resulting in greater segregation. Unspoilt village rustics donned the uniform and trained into the goose step march.
The hospital system with neatly dressed nurses and doctors facilitated the multinational drug companies.
The cake, cutlet, sandwich and patty eating, birthday celebrating elite class took the world by storm. As someone shot back at the Britisher's ulterior motives recently at such a function, “I say you guys would be still in your amude (loin cloth), eating vandu aappa and playing Elle, doing caste based jobs if not for the Suddha”. The recipient of the remark ran into stony silence.
Non egalitarian environment
Sinhala and Pirivena based education was neatly replaced by English, classifying locals into English educated, landed gentry that strutted like peacocks looking down on the Sinhala educated, poverty stricken classes. Wealth indeed was a passport to virtue and status.
Elitism gave rise to segregation and the birth of this bourgeoise elite - political, business and religious, paved the way for endless stratification. Nevertheless, social order was seen but at the cost of a native system being undermined for the west's benefit not to forget the accompanying social frustration that came about in a highly competitive, stratified, non egalitarian environment. While globally, a homogenous populace was their aim with common language, culture, religion, medical services, legal system, education and what not, whatever was local in the colonies was segregated, divided and rifts brought about to realize the divide and rule policy targeted towards a world economy in their favour. The al-qaeda uprising then should not surprise us. The Islamic system of governance through the caliphate ceased to be. Their banking system was folded up not to forget the social welfare measures.
The west began to speak much on the least practiced lofty ideals of human rights, egalitarianism, equality and social equity. As a result of their denying the world the intellectual and scholarly heritage of Islam, the aggressive Muslim uprising were denied the knowledge of a refined and moral confrontation of the system the west sealed worldwide which has now boomeranged on them.
Al-qaeda today knows nothing beyond the gun to fight the system thanks to the westerner! There is nothing that the west left for them of their culture and learning for these youngsters to be inspired. Even in the schools’ system the young minds were exposed to Percy B. Shelley, William Wordsworth, T. S. Eliot, Jane Austen, Charles Dickens and so goes the list while Muslim intellectuals, scholars, writers and poets like Jalaluddin Rumi, the mystic lady Rabia, Omar Khayyam, Hasan Al Basri, Nafeesatul Misriya, Khaleel Gibran 10th century Iranian mathematician Isfahani, the unusual combination of Botanist, Geographer and Historian Kathir Imad L Din, Astronomer and Mathematician Jabir ibn Sinan Harari - as - Sabi, Andalusian philosopher physician and intellectual Abu Bakr Muhammed ibn Tufail - al - Qayisi, Astronomer and AstrologerYahya -ibn - Galib, Seville born famous medical physician of the western Caliphate, Astronomer Hassan Abdul Rahman (903 - 986), Engineering and mechanics Musa ibn Shakir, Astronomy, Geometry, Physics and Engineering Jaffar Muhammed ibn Musa of Baghdad (800-873) Scientist Musa Ibrahim, Engineering and geometry Hassan ibn Musa (incidentally, they were the famous learned Musa Brothers of Baghdad), Mathematician Ahmed ibn Muadh al Jayyani that wrote the first treatise on spherical geometry (989 - Cordova), Mathematician Tamimi from Baghdad (980 - 1037), Geographer Yuhanna ibn Sarabiyun, scholar in Political Science, Jurisprudence, Ethics and Sociology Habib al Mawardi (not to my ears the mention of this name during my post graduate studies in Sociology at the Colombo University except of course Talcott Parson, Durkheim and other western Sociologists) among others were conveniently kept off the school curriculum, needless to mention the numerous other Muslim scientists, astronomers, mathematicians whose names were thrown overboard in Britain's attempt of homogenizing the world, Muslim resistance of which has reached saturation point as we see in the numerous anti-west Islamic organizations that have mushroomed worldwide.
Romeo and Juliet is considered the epitome of literary genius while the Quranic romance of Yusuf and Zulaiha was licensed into irreversible unworthiness.
These British originated, western backed wanton and calculated motives is ample proof of their ‘bona fide' over their much spoken of ‘egalitarian’ concept restricted only to chosen territory. If the west segregated indigenous communities it was to divide and rule and if they ever homogenized the world it was to make that rule easier. Both were to their socio, economic and political advantage.
This then is not to disown in toto the west's contribution towards social progress. For example the caste system which suppressed and denied people in the colonies upward social mobility, was uprooted and replaced by a class based society under which poverty is heavily exploited. Earlier, the monarch's tyrannical rule left no opportunity for people to rise up the social ladder. So what the richer class made of the class system is not imperialist's blame. Accountability towards the poor is the responsibility of the rich whose forebears ironically, tasted the same suffering under caste rule.
Lack of social consciousness
Economic segregation that followed from the class economy apart from ethno/religious /linguistic/political segregation, further disintegrated the population. Social frustration progressively increased. Under a class environment, the English educated, monied elite whose forebears at the very beginning were socially placed down below in the caste ladder treated those in the lower class as lesser mortals. Segregation heightened with the onset of class.
However, blaming the British alone for these irregularities would not suffice. The local leadership ought to have been creative enough to rectify the ‘legacy’ of segregation by behaving more responsibly after taking over from where the British left. Instead, their choice preference was to maximize that ‘legacy’ and move towards self-centredness and acquisitive tendencies. The unlimited greed for money, power and position, the disinterest in working towards social equity, competition, status consciousness and what not led the national populace into the quagmire that has come to be.
Much remains to be seen whether the minds of social, political, business and religious elite not only in Sri Lanka, worldwide as well would be emptied of opulence, greed,vanity and all that negates the higher goals for which man was created. As long as majoritarianism in local settings and the super power mania in international realms persist, all endevours into social equity is remote if not unattainable for in both these elements is clearly a lack of social consciousness. They themselves are byproducts of segregation which in turn gives rise to stratification and loss of equity. Segregation and equity certainly do not synchronize. Shared power and an all inclusive approach both internationally and locally are key elements to equity and world peace. If not, egalitarianism and equity would continue to remain only highbrow rhetoric within United Nation's confines with world peace not even a distant hope.
