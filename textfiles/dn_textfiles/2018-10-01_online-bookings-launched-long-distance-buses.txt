Online bookings launched for long distance buses

In a bid to fall in line with some of the advancement of online ticket bookings, The National Transport Commission (NTC) has launched an online booking facility for long distance private buses starting from Colombo.
This facility which is now operational was launched by Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva at the Ministry premises last week.
This will also given an opportunity for tourists to book online even prior to them arriving in Sri Lanka, through the website www.ntcbooking.lk, an official from the Transport Ministry said. “With this new facility, passengers can book their seats without any inconvenience,” an official from the ministry said.
A service fee of Rs.30 passengers would be charged in addition to the bus fare when making an online booking.
Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) intends importing 500 new buses for $ 20 million under the Indian line of credit. Four hundred 57 seat buses and hundred 35 seat buses will be imported. In addition 1000 low floor buses from Hungary too would be imported.
