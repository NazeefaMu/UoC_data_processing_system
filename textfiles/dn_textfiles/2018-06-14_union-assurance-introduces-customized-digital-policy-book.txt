Union Assurance introduces customized digital policy book

Union Assurance (UA) is renowned for setting new trends and novel approaches in terms of embracing disruptive technology and digital initiatives.
UA has made its efforts to offer a novel experience for the customers with a blend of digital flavour making it a life changing moment for both the customer and the company.
UA recently introduced the first of its kind, customized digital policy book to its valuable customers which could provide the most convenient service and transparency related to the policy information they have always been looking for. Through this customized digital policy book, the customers would be able to receive all the information related to their life insurance cover at their fingertips. This approach will eliminate the issues and delays the customers had to face in terms of receiving overall details about their life insurance policy.
According to the new method, all the customers will receive a text message to their mobile phone with a link where the customers will be able to view personalized information of their Life Insurance policy. The digital policy books are also enabled with QR codes with the ‘Insurance Simplified’ feature which was introduced to deliver simplified policy documents by explaining policy terms and conditions unambiguously.
UA partnered with DOK Solutions Lanka (Pvt) Limited, one of the leading Record Management and Document Archiving Companies in Sri Lanka to provide an end-to end policy management.
Iroshini Tittagalla (General Manager – Life) expressing her views on this novel approach stated that “We are extremely glad to introduce yet another novel approach where we can add value and share the experience of convenience with all our customers. The novel approach would provide the customers with easy access to information about their Life Insurance Policy related information at their fingertips without any delay. Furthermore, UA is grateful that we were able to partner with DOK Solution Lanka to drive this initiative successfully.”
PrabodhanieWanigasundara Chief Operating Officer DOK Solutions Lanka stated “It’s a privilege for us to partner with an Industry leader like Union Assurance who always strive to deliver extra value addition to its customers with the aid of latest technology.”
