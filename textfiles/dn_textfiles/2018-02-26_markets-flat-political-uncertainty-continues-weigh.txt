Point of view
Political uncertainty over the future of the coalition government continued to cloud investor sentiment this week, with equity markets moving sideways as the benchmark ASPI moved up just 4 points to consolidate at the 6570 level.
Turnover levels however, improved 21% W-o-W to Rs. 0.87Bn, back in line with the YTD average of Rs. 0.86Bn and in contrast to the Rs.0.72Bn recorded last week.
Turnover levels were aided largely by the return of the Institutional and HNI investors who accounted for 32% of market activity this week, cf. the previous 3-weeks when they accounted for just 25% of market activity.
Positive macro-data in the form of lower national inflation levels in January and a stronger external position in December along with relatively robust corporate earnings stoked investor appetite for risky assets.
Of the 85% of corporates who have reported earnings thus far (total earnings of Rs. 65Bn cf. Rs. 75Bn for all companies in Dec’16), 51% have recorded Y-o-Y gains in earnings.
Meanwhile, after a slight dip in their appetite for risky domestic assets in the immediate aftermath of the LG polls last week, foreign investors returned quite strongly back to equity markets this week, pumping in a net of Rs.908Mn (+84% WoW) to the Colombo bourse cf. last week when net foreign inflows declined 32% Wow to Rs. 493Mn.
Markets in the week ahead are likely to look for cues from the conclusion of the corporate earnings season.
Sri Lanka records second highest BoP surplus in 2017
Sri Lanka’s Balance-of-Payments (B-o-P) position in 2017 recorded a surplus for the 1st time in 2 years amid consistent improvements in the country’s external sector throughout the year.
Relative to the deficit of $0.5Bn in 2016 and deficit of $1.5Bn in 2015, the B-o-P surplus in 2017 was $2.1Bn, the country’s 2nd highest surplus since 2009 when it recorded an overall balance of $2.7Bn.
The surplus position was driven primarily by consistent financial flows over the year as robust financial flows to debt ($1.7Bn cf. $1.2Bn in 2016) and equity markets ($279Mn cf. $19Mn in 2016) along with higher FDI’s ($766Mn cf. $397Mn), receipt of the IMF EFF tranches ($419Mn) and proceeds from ISB issuances ($1.5Bn) aided overall capital inflows.
Earnings from exports over December meanwhile surpassed $1Bn mark for the 5th consecutive time this year, helping the cumulative export earnings for 2017 hit a historically high value of $11.4Bn.
Despite the stronger export performance however, the cumulative trade deficit for 2017 rose to $9.6Bn (cf. $8.9Bn in 2016), reflecting higher import expenditure due to weather-related factors.
Import expenditure in 2017 rose to a historical high of $21Bn largely due to the drought-induced need for fuel and rice imports. Nevertheless, the marginal improvement in tourist earnings ($3.6Bn cf. $3.5Bn in 2016) and largely steady workers’ remittances ($7.2Bn) helped curb the trade deficit to an extent.
