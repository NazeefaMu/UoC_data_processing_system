NCP work disrupted over toilet issue

A toilet issue had disrupted work and created a tense situation at the North Central Provincial Council Revenue Department.
A high official appointed to the department to oversee work during the time of former Chief Minister S.M. Ranijth was alleged to have kept the senior officers' toilet shut.
A case filed against this official's appointment by another senior officer was pending in the Colombo High Court.
A spokesperson said it is inappropriate to use women's toilet by male officers and their request to get a toilet opened for senior officials had fallen on deaf ears.
They say the Chief Secretary has to intervene to settle the issue.
