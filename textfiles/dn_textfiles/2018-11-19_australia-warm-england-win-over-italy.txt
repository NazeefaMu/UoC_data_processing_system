Australia warm up for England with win over Italy

PADUA, Italy, Saturday: Marika Koroibete scored two tries as Australia beat Italy 26-7 on Saturday amid controversy in Padua over two disallowed scores for the hosts, as the Wallabies relieved the pressure on under-fire coach Michael Cheika ahead of next week’s clash with England at Twickenham.
Koroibete crossed twice in five first half minutes and Taniela Tupou and Will Genia added two more after the break to get Australia back to winning ways after last weekend’s defeat to Wales in Cardiff.
However it wasn’t all an easy ride against Italy, who held out against the two-time world champions for the first half an hour and were enraged by Tito Tebaldi and Braam Steyn both having tries disallowed in the first 15 minutes.
The win was a boost For Australian counterpart Cheika, whose side have just four wins out of 12 games this season. “I’m not going to say anything about the refree ... I thought we were really good considering the situation of the season,” said Cheika. “Now we have to look to see what we need next week (against England).
“We love going to Twickenham, love the crowd hating us, so let’s get it on!” – AFP
