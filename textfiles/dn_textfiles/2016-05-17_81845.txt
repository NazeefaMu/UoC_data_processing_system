‘Let Her Cry’

Asoka Handagama’s latest film 'Let Her Cry' (Ege Esa Aga), already a hot topic among filmgoers, is screening for a limited number of days in cinemas in the CEL circuit, which includes Regal Colombo. With this film, the most respected veteran character-actress of Sri Lankan cinema, Swarna Mallawarachchi marks her return to the silver screen with a stunning performance. Dhritiman Chaterji, the popular Indian actor who has acted in films by Satyajit Ray and Mirnal Sen plays the lead male role.
Rithika Kodithuwakku and Sandali Ash are the other lead performers. Music for 'Let Her Cry' was composed by Chitral ‘Chity’ Somapala who sings the theme song “Aharenna- Wake Up” which has already become a hit among Chitral’s fan circle.
The film will be in theatres only for a limited number of days as it is released in a gap between two films in the main stream.
