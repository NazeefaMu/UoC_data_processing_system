‘Special medical team to handle health emergencies’

An emergency response team is to be established soon to face health emergencies in the country, Health Services Acting Director General Dr. Jayasundara Bandara said.
He was addressing a press conference at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo yesterday.
Dr. Bandara said the need for a qualified and trained team was felt during recent health emergencies, especially during the dengue `attack’ in Kinniya.
The Health Ministry is to upgrade clinical activities of the Trincomalee General Hospital and that of the Kinniya hospital. High Dependency Units were established for dengue patients in those hospitals. Additional doctors and consultants were deployed, he said.
The Ministry deployed PHIs and Civil Defence Force members to eradicate mosquito breeding spots in the affected areas, Dr. Bandara said.
