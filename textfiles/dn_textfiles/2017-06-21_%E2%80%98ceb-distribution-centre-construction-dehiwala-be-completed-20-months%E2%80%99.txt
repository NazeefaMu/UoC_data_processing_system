Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, who laid the foundation stone for the headquarters building of the CEB’s distribution region 4 at Dehiwala on June 15, said the building will be completed in 20 months as planned.
The Minister said the previous day was also significant for them as they called tenders for the supply of 60 megawatts of solar energy for 20 stations. He said solar energy cost, which was Rs. 23.10 per unit, had now decreased to Rs. 17.01 per unit. Tenders for the supply of estimated future electricity needs would also be met within the next two months.
This included 840 megawatts of electricity, 200 megawatts of solar energy and 200 megawatts of wind power energy, he said.
