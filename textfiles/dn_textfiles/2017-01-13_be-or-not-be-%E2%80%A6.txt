To be  or not  to be …

“To be or not to be: That’s the question”. The above words taken from Prince Hamlet’s soliloquy in William Shakespeare’s play by the same name must be in the mind of President Maithripala Sirisena in view of the new voices heard from spokesmen of his own party about retaining the executive presidency.
Championing the campaign for retention of the executive presidency the Dissanayake duo in the SLFP high Command – General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake and maverick politician S B Dissanayake want President Sirisena to contest the next Presidential election. Only former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga has openly contradicted their story. Whether it is approved or not by the SLFP Central Committee it does not seem to be a result of careful deliberation for the party has been long campaigning for its abolition.
They have a ‘fine’ argument. Since President Sirisena is now the President of the SLFP, a position thrust upon him, he must abide by the party decision. That is he is denied the freedom enjoyed today by everyone else in the SLFP who openly flout every canon of party discipline and general consensual behaviour. For example, former President Rajapaksa and the politicians hanging around him have the liberty even to form rival political parties.
Executive presidency
It is necessary to keep in mind that the above call for retention of the executive presidency has been made despite the explicit assurance given by President Sirisena that he would abolish it. That was an assurance given to the public and endorsed by 6.2 million people. No decision of a political party, least of all of the SLFP which stands disunited and fragmented could override this popular verdict. It would not be impolite to remind the SLFP that President Sirisena won despite its own opposition and most of those ask President Sirisena now to contest again for presidency were his opponents.
If President Sirisena agrees to the proposal of the Dissanayake duo he would be dishonouring his election promise. It would make him fall into the category of unreliable and opportunist politicians and ruin his stature as an honest statesman. Thus the acceptance of this proposal by the President would result in his own ruin. This would be an example how foolish and naïve friends could be more dangerous than sworn enemies!
The main thing, however, is not what would happen to the President or to any other individual for that matter. It would be the effect on the country and its people. Almost four-decade old experience of the executive presidency has shown its dictatorial and anti-democratic nature. It has amassed enormous powers on an individual holding that office, who could override both the legislature and the judiciary at his will. It has proved to be disastrous with the legislature made impotent and the loss of independence of the judiciary. Retention of this authoritarian system would have the possibility of dragging the country towards the tribal and despotic regime that was ousted by the people on January 8th.
Constitutional reform process
This new love for the executive presidency has arisen parallel to the advance of the Constitutional reform process. It is a ploy to sabotage that effort by blackmailing the people that a change in the executive presidency would result in an inevitable defeat a referendum. This is also a ploy used by the racist forces to prevent any meaningful devolution of power to reach a democratic solution to the National Question. Thus its proponents want to kill several birds with one stone. That the SLFP seems to have capitulated its position to the racists is evidenced also by its reported hesitation to go beyond and even implement the 13th Amendment in full.
A presidential election is still far off. It would take place in 2020. Then, why hurry with naming candidates and speculating on alliances and chances of victory? The talk is part of the speculation about the victory of the SLFP 
over the UNP at the next Presidential election. Here Constitutional changes are mirrored in personalities and not based on policies. It is not individuals that matter but policies and practices. The question is whether the Constitution would advance democracy and not whether it could produce a Messiah to solve all problems

The SLFP internal feud will not die off before the next presidential election. The new political party of the Rajapaksa clique would continue to challenge the official SLFP leadership. Whatever deals that it may have with certain leading personalities of both the SLFP and the UNP, it would in all probability would field its own candidate, at least a proxy at the presidential election ensuring a three-cornered fight in the main.
Though its result cannot be foreseen it will not be a new version of the comedy film Three Idiots. It has, however, the possibility of a defeat for the incumbent in office, should he consent to contest.
Consensus Government
Leaving speculation on a far-off election, the SLFP could far better concentrate its energies on serious soul-searching to find out what went wrong and convert it into disciplined modern party with democratic ideals shedding racist and opportunist deviations of the immediate past so that it could better withstand the rigours of any election battle.
Also it has a duty by the people to honour election pledges of President Sirisena and respect its own agreement with the UNP and to take part in a consensus Government or abrogate the agreement and openly separate honourably. The absurd policy of keeping the cake and eating it simultaneously should be abandoned.
In conclusion, it must be said that retention of the executive presidency should be opposed by all who desire a change for the better. Unless the masses openly challenge this despotic call for its retention people would again be thrown into suffering under a more autocratic a regime, whatever the hues and shades in its political spectrum may be.
