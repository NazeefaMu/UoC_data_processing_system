Women’s 400m semi-finals

American athletics great Allyson Felix will bid to take another step towards a 10th world gold when she bids to safely negotiate her way into the 400m final. The 31-year-old said: “I feel good, peaking at the right time.”
But standing in her way will be Shaunae Miller-Uibo, the Bahamian who denied her Olympic gold last year and looked in sublime form as she posted a faster time in her heat of 50.97sec. – AFP
