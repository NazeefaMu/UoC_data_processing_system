We have forgiven our father’s killers: Rahul Gandhi

Rahul Gandhi, son of former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi who was assassinated by the LTTE, said that he and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had “completely” forgiven their father’s killers. “For many years, we were quite upset and hurt, but somehow... (we have) completely (forgiven them),” Gandhi said to a loud applause by an audience during a programme in Singapore on Friday.
Gandhi also spoke about the assassination of his grandmother Indira Gandhi and father Rajiv, stressing that it was a price that the family knew they had to pay for taking a stand. “In politics, if you oppose the wrong forces and stand for something, you will die”, he said.
“We knew that my father was going to die. We knew that my grandmother was going to die,” he said.
“My grandmother told me she was going to die and my father... I told him he was going to die,” Gandhi said. The Congress put out a video of the hour-long question-and-answer session on its Twitter handle.
Indira Gandhi was assassinated in 1984 by security guards with whom he used to play badminton.
Rajiv Gandhi was attacked by a female Sri Lankan Tamil suicide bomber at an election rally near Chennai in 1991. It was an assassination that LTTE ideologue Anton Balasingham, according to a 2016 book, had conceded was the outfit’s “biggest mistake.”
Gandhi, 47, has spoken about his father’s assassination in the past, but so far, declined to talk about his father’s assassins. Similar to when J. Jayalalithaa had proposed to release the seven persons serving a life-term in 2016, Congress had strongly objected, but Gandhi had underlined that this was a decision the government had to take. “I will not give my personal opinion on this,” he had said.
Gandhi opened up to talking about how he and his sister looked at the assassination and the assassins during the interaction with IIM alumni in Singapore.
The session had started with a question on the privileges that Gandhi, who is often derided for his political career as a member of the Congress’ first family, the Gandhi-Nehrus, had enjoyed.
Yes, there were a number of privileges “where I sit, but I wouldn’t say I haven’t been through a rough ride,” he said as he began to talk about the assassination of his grandmother Indira Gandhi and father, Rajiv Gandhi.
“So you live in a particular environment, surrounded by 15 people, morning, noon and night. I don’t think that’s a privilege,” he said.
But these tragedies, he said, had conditioned him to see the human face behind the killings and not bear any hatred on anyone.
Gandhi recalled that when he saw Prabhakaran lying dead on the television in 2009, two thoughts had crossed his mind. “I had two feelings; the first was why they are humiliating this man in this way... and second was, I felt uneasy...his family and kids. I understood deeply what it meant to be on the other side, he said, going on to speak about the phone call he made to his sister.
“He killed papa,” Gandhi told her,”I should be happy that he is dead. Why am I not happy?”
Priyanka Gandhi Vadra told him she felt the same. (NDTV)
