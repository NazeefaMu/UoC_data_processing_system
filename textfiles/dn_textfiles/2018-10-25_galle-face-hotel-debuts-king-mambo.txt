Galle Face Hotel debuts King of the Mambo

King of the Mambo opened recently at the Galle Face Hotel this week with cocktails expertly mixed by an award-winning mixologist, Mediterranean-Cuban cuisine and live entertainment.
King of the Mambo brings to life the swinging traditions of Colombo’s legendary Galle Face Hotel, a family-owned property that has hosted some of the world’s most distinguished names on its iconic seafront terraces. “We’re delighted to be bringing an authentic South American experience to Colombo,” says Galle Face Hotel General Manager and Area Vice President Robert Hauck.
“Galle Face Hotel hosted Che Guevara when he visited Sri Lanka in 1959, so introducing this concept in 2018 feels like we’re reconnecting with those heady days of the 50s when the mambo was all the rage around the world. Today we see a much more diverse and culturally rich Cuban influence on popular culture, and we’re excited to be tapping into that,” he added.
The lounge-restaurant is casual but trendy with 50’s style warm interiors accented by bold mementos to its Cuban influence. The space contains air conditioned as well as open-air sections with stunning vantage point views across the Indian Ocean; everything melding together to create the perfect ambience for evening cocktails and dancing overlooking the sunset.
King of the Mambo’s Italian chef makes the restaurant’s Mediterranean cuisine and Cuban signature dishes a highlight. In a resounding nod to the generosity of South American cuisine the menu contains many dishes that can be shared, like Tacos Dominicanos (beef rib tacos with sour cream and avocado guacamole) and Arroz a la cubana (rice smothered with tomato sauce, banana and fried egg). The space also features a large BBQ area for live cooking with specials such as Naranjito Braseao (woody salmon) and Media Vaca (a giant Tomahawk steak, big enough for six people).
At the bar, cocktails are mixed by the 2018 Hotel School flair bartending competition winner- an expert mixologist who understands the alchemy needed to craft a delicious cocktail from the premium quality beverages on the shelves- then served on custom made mugs of ceramic to reduce condensation.
King of the Mambo opens at noon every day, and service is open until late. The live entertainment is as essential as the cuisine, and takes place daily in the form of a band or DJ, with regular performances from Cuban entertainers. The lounge also houses a wine cellar designed especially for intimate wine tastings, and a tastefully decked out private karaoke room. For small, private events the space also contains an air-conditioned dining room that can seat 14. The venue can seat 170 persons overall.
Dubai-based Infini Concepts partnered with Galle Face Hotel to launch King of the Mambo, their first venue in Sri Lanka, with two more set to open in 2019.
Infini Restaurant Management, recently established in Sri Lanka, will look after the day to day management of the restaurants. CEO David Lescarret promises more to come from the restaurant, including regular promotions and Sunday brunch. For the moment, King of the Mambo opens with the promise of salty sea breeze-tinged evenings full of life, laughter and dancing on Colombo’s most iconic seafront property.
