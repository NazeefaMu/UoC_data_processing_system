Five corruption cases against Johnston Fernando fixed for trial

Five corruption cases filed against former Minister Johnston Fernando for non-declaration of assets and liabilities as a Parliamentarian for five years, were fixed for trial by the Colombo Chief Magistrate yesterday.
When the five corruption cases came up before Chief Magistrate Lal Bandara, the cases were fixed for trial on September 8.
The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption alleged that the former minister had failed to declare his assets and liabilities for five years since 2010.
The commission had filed charges against the former Minister in the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court under Section 9 of the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law No. 1 of 1975.
