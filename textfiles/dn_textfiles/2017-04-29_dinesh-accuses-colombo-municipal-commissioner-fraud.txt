Dinesh accuses Colombo Municipal Commissioner of fraud

The Colombo Municipal Commissioner has allegedly been involved in a fraud running into millions of rupees involving garbage, MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena charged in Parliament yesterday.
The MP, joining in the adjournment debate on the Meethotamulla disaster, levelled corruption allegations against the Colombo Municipal Commissioner.
MP Gunawardena thanked President Maithripala Sirisena for appointing a special commission to investigate the Meethotamulla garbage dump collapse. “Thirty two people had died and more are still unaccounted for.
“The Colombo Municipal Commissioner should take responsibility for this tragedy.
Warning after warning had been given to stop dumping garbage at Meethotamulla, but garbage dumping had continued ignoring the warnings,” he stated.
The MP also criticised the Government for not holding the Local Government Elections, pointing out that the situation could have been managed better had the CMC and other Local Government bodies functioned properly.
He pointed out the Commissioner alone could not handle the situation without the support of Council members.
MP Gunawardena also questioned the role played by the disaster management authorities during the Meethotamulla tragedy. “Our disaster management arm is very slow to react. We need a disaster management flying squad that is alert round the clock and can be immediately deployed to any part of the country,” he proposed.
“The Colombo Municipal Commissioner said fears of a collapse had been there for over a week. Were the disaster management authorities sleeping?” he questioned.
The MP also said the housing projects from which the victims in Meethotamulla were given houses were started during the previous Government’s time. “Had those not initiated the Government would have been utterly helpless” he added.
