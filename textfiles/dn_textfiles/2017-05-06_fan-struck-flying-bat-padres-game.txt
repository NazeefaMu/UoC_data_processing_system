Fan struck by flying bat at Padres game

LOS ANGELES Friday: A bat flew from the hands of Padres hitter Hector Sanchez Thursday and struck a fan sitting behind home plate in the head, team officials said.
Sanchez had swung and missed a pitch in the ninth inning when the bat slipped out of his hands and flew over the netting designed to protect fans in the stands.
It hit two people, the Padres said, including a woman who was struck in the forehead.
“We never want to see anybody injured while enjoying a game at Petco Park,” the Padres said in a statement. “The guests who were struck by Hector Sanchez’s bat in the ninth inning have received medical attention and been transported to a local hospital.” As ushers and medical personnel rushed to help the woman hit in the head, the crowd went silent.
Eventually, she walked to a wheelchair and was wheeled out as her fellow fans applauded.
“Both were in good spirits and their injuries do not appear to be serious,” the Padres said.
After play resumed, Sanchez popped out. The Padres eventually fell 3-2 to the Colorado Rockies in 11 innings.
