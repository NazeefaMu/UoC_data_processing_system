[CITIZENS' Mail - (28-02-2017)]

Question of legality
A prominent government minister recently claimed that the Malabe Private Medical College has earned the legal status. The minister added that the much-spoken institute is an approved entity of the University Grants Commission. All this had come to pass during the previous regime under the Mahinda Rajapaksa presidency.
If the minister speaks truth, the SAITM is a legal entity. But then why is this so called Joint Opposition creating a great fuss about an institute already established as a legal entity during their regime? Is it merely a measure taken to counter good policy measures of the incumbent government?
The good minister offers a valid argument. If there are hundreds of private institutions affiliated foreign university bodies in Sri Lanka, then what is wrong with the SAITM? Of course a poor student cannot afford overpriced rates offered at the SAITM. However, the rich students are anyway blessed with the opportunity to study abroad. Such students will get an opportunity to study in Sri Lanka. So you would not get the hard earned monies flowing out of Sri Lanka. So why not make SAITM a private medical college as a place for students who can afford to pay the expensive rates? This is a democratic country, after all.
What an average medical student does is they opt for private practice. Most doctors are hell-bent on money-making. Mind you, these students have studied from the tax money. At least the SAITM students are learning from their own funds. So they have every right to opt for private practice and earn millions.
