STF protection for ‘vulnerable prisoners’ mooted

Discussions are underway to deploy Police Special Task Force (STF) to provide security to prison buses when transporting ‘vulnerable prisoners,’Police Spokesman DIG Priyantha Jayakody told the Daily News yesterday.
He said this proposal came up during a meeting attended by IGP Pujith Jayasundara and Commissioner General of Prisons H.M.N.C.Dhanasinghe. He said ‘vulnerable prisoners’ would be identified after a threat assessment based on the intelligence reports.
“The discussions were related to providing assistance to the Prison Department to intensify the security of inmates. We are planning a systemic way to provide security to prison buses carrying prisoners. Most probably the STF will also be utilised for the purpose,” he said.
