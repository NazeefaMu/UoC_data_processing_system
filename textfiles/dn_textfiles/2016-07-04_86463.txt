ICC approves changes to DRS lbw law

The ICC has approved changes to the lbw umpire’s call in the DRS playing conditions, with the conclusion of its annual conference in Edinburgh on Saturday.
For on-field lbw decisions to be overturned, half of the ball would now need to hit a zone of the stumps that also borders the outside of off and leg stumps. Earlier, half of the ball would need to hit a zone between the centre of off and leg stumps.
An ICC release said: “The size of the zone inside which half the ball needs to hit for a Not Out decision to be reversed to Out will increase, changing to a zone bordered by the outside of off and leg stumps, and the bottom of the bails (formerly the centre of off and leg stumps, and the bottom of the bails).”
The amendment will come into effect from October 1 or from the start of any series using DRS that commences just prior to this date.
The change will benefit bowlers and more batsmen will be given out once on-field decisions are referred as the “zone” the ball needs to hit for the decision to be overturned has increased.
In a decision concerning calling of no-balls, the ICC will arrange a trial in the coming months to assess if the third umpire could use instant replays to call no-balls more accurately. The trial is likely to take place during an upcoming ODI series and the third umpire will judge no-balls within a few seconds of the ball being delivered and communicate it to the on-field umpire.
