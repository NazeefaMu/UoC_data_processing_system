GMOA token strike today

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) has decided to launch an islandwide token strike today at 8.00 am. Channelling and private practice will also be halted during the strike, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Aluthge said all emergency treatment will not be affected by the strike while the doctors will carry out all emergency care as usual. The strike will not take place at all children’s, maternity, cancer, kidney and army hospitals in the country.
The GMOA will monitor whether any members do private practice or channelling during the strike.
The token strike will be held in protest of the free trade agreement already signed and the free trade agreements to be signed without establishing a National Policy.
“Minister Malik Samarawickrama has no mandate from the people to act according to his own wishes and satisfy handful of individuals by destroying the entire country and its future,”he said.
The token strike will be halted if President Maithripala Sirisena gives an appointment to meet him before launching the token strike and promises the GMOA that he will not allow to sign any more FTAs without a National Policy and look into the issue of the FTA signed with Singapore, he said.
