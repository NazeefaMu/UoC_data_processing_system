Dreaming with words

The poet is generally regarded as a dreamer, but the truth is that he is a great seer. He is both a dreamer and a seer. Our great bard, myriad minded William Shakespeare, opines that the lunatic, the poet and the lover are in the same mood. Yet, it is very interesting when we peruse through the great lines of poetry and poetic drama composed by the literary icons of universal repute to understand the current political, social, cultural, economic and other spheres of public life in the Sri Lankan context.
It seems very accurate that the poet is a dreamer. Some vociferous critics argue that the dreams of the poets remain in the realm of literary diversion. The his-story has proved beyond doubt that poetic dreaming is also accurate as that of the bridge engineers and scientists. The writer humbly believes that the dreams of the visionary poets gain ground in the long run. One should not be in a hurry to realize dreams.
A political party may take a number of decades to reach the goal of gaining power of the country. Our own traditional left has not been able to establish socialism in our country. At the present rate our radical new left may take another eon to do so. Yet they are not crestfallen. An invention is putting scientific wisdom to a dream. One need not know rocket science to understand this simple truth.
A nugget of gold could be dug out, but an automobile. A dream has to be converted into steel and a model. If an in-depth study is made into modern inventions, one could understand that poetry of yester year is today’s modern magic. On this ground, one should not laugh at poets as dreamers. The harmless madness of the poet goes a long way. The poet is the specialist of the society, the path finder and the great seer. He tunes the whole word for the forward march. A wise engineer could contact a poet and get a flash of future. The poet is the dreamer and the engineer makes dream over in to fibre of tomorrow’ life
My concern here is not of that sort. It is true poetry. The poem for my discussion is taken from classical literature. The writer personally believes that it is opportune more than before to have a constant discussion by the rational and right thinking intellectuals to take the country out of the treacherous bog of the political and moral paralysis through classical literature. It is not a Himalayan task as it seems. The good governance cauldron seems to be at the highest boiling point and the timely interference in a classical approach would mitigate the suffering of the political mayhem.
ZIMRI, for easy reference, is considered one of the greatest political poems ever written in English poetry.It is a political satire of great universal importance. This acid criticism on a political figure was first published anon. Yet its poetic brilliance was attributed to DRYDEN not in uncertain terms. It was a time in England that a legitimate suitor to the throne was difficult to be found. But in Sri Lanka such things are not heard of. It is a feather in our cap. This powerful and direct satire was instrumental in correcting the situation in England to a certain extent. Therefore, the writer is optimistic of the same outcome even in lighter vein, here.
The celebrated first line of this poem signals the appearance of ZIMRI in the immediate development of the poetic narration.
‘ Some of their chiefs were princes of the land:
In the first rank of these did ZIMRI stand.’
At first glance, anyone would think that ZIMRI is going to be highly praised –‘ in the first rank’.
The poet adds more in a very satirical manner.
‘ A man so various, that he seemed to be
Not one, but all mankind’s epitome’
The crux of the matter is that newly emerging ZIMRIS on the political arena of our country seem to be all knowing. They speak on anything, nothing seems alien to them. Let any political, social, economic, psychological, medical, astronomical or anything under the sun happens they are the first to open their foul mouths. The authorities on the particular subject have to get a back seat till they finish. At last nothing is talked. The beauty of this poem is that it is not raw satire, it is banter like.
The conundrum for me is that how John Dryden could imagine the real dispositions of our politicians being born in a faraway country a long time ago. The reader would be flabbergasted to know the real characteristics of ZIMRI and how akin our politicians’ dispositions are. I hope further understanding of the poetic vision would expand the readers’ outlook to know about our leaders.
‘Stiff in the opinion, always in the wrong,
Was everything by start and nothing long;
But, in course of one revolving moon
Was chemist, fiddler, statesman, and buffoon;
Then all for women, painting, rhyming, drinking,
Besides ten thousand freaks that died in thinking.’
It is common knowledge in our country that some ministers, some adrenalin type politicians, pseudo intellectuals, and full-blooded patriots, literary fossils jump into hasty decisions and even go on to say that they would not stop their struggle till they unplug all the foreign lending institutions and NGOs , very ironically they themselves make a clean breast to their followers later. Most of the red brigade politicians deviate from their original political parties thinking that they would be garlanded to the presidential palace, but end in the political dustbin.
