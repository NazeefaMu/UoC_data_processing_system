District Court refuses to issue order against GMOA strike

 
The Colombo District Court refused to issue an enjoining order today, preventing the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) from conducting a token strike tomorrow.
The GMOA has scheduled to hold a strike tomorrow against SAITM.
 Colombo District Court Judge Sujeewa Nissanka made this order pursuant to a lawsuit filed by a 75-year-old male heart patient, a resident of Athul Kotte.  
Meanwhile, notices for injunction order were issued against the Chairman of GMOA and other officials to appear in Court on May 4.
The petitioner H.I. Piyasena stated that he had gotten to known through media that the GMOA had planned a strike as a protest against the SAITM causing inconvenience to general public and challenging a judgment issued by Court of Appeal.
While refusing to issue an Enjoining Order against the GMOA, the District Judge observed that the petitioner is not a patient who is currently being treated in a hospital.
