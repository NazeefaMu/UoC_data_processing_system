BFSI Excellence & Leadership Awards 2018: Fairfirst Insurance secures two titles

Fairfirst Insurance won the titles of General Insurance Company of the Year and Health Insurance Company of the year award at the recently concluded Banking, Financial Services and Insurance Excellence and Leadership Awards 2018.
Re-establishing their stronghold in the health insurance sector, this is the third consecutive win for Fairfirst the largest private health insurer in the country.
Over the last two years Fairfirst won the title of Excellence in Medical Insurance at the Fintelekt Insurance Industry Awards and have continued to be at the top of their game.
Supported by a strong underwriting team and leading customer servicing team, the Fairfirst medical insurance coverage is without doubt one of the best in the industry. Providing protection for employees of large corporates and individuals alike, Fairfirst’s affiliation with one of the largest property and casualty insurers in the world – Fairfax has proven to be a crucial success factor.
Thushara Edirisooriya, Head of Surgical at Fairfirst said, “We are constantly looking at ways to improve ourselves and how we service people. We have insured over a million lives and we hope to keep growing our insured base as we move forward”.
Among the top General Insurers of the country, Fairfirst continues to break barriers and set new standards with their unique products and propositions.
For instance, immediately responding to last year’s dengue epidemic was the agile team at Fairfirst who introduced the first ever Dengue Insurance Policy as an aid for the unexpected financial distress people were in.
Other innovative properties include the recently launched Online Insurance Shop which is revolutionizing how insurance is made available to customers.
The launch of the AI based chat bot Machan too has significantly improved real time communication with customers and allows them to keep up to speed on their claim status.
“It’s nice to be appreciated for doing something right. We remain focused to deliver the best to our customers and promote an exciting career for our employees who are incredible”, said Dr. Sanjeev Jha, Managing Director and CEO of Fairfirst Insurance.
