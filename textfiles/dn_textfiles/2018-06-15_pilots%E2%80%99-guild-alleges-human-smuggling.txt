Pilots’ Guild alleges human smuggling

Pilots’ Guild President Captain Ruwan Vithanage stated he would produce a witness who could provide details of several airline employees who aided and abetted human smuggling acts in the past.
He was testifying before the Presidential Commission to investigate alleged fraud and corruption at SriLankan Airlines and Mihin Lanka yesterday.
Vithanage urged the Commission to probe the details this witness will reveal about several SriLankan employees helping human smuggling. He told the Commission to ascertain whether the details were correct and take necessary action against those responsible.
Vithanage said his organisation had no knowledge whether the SriLankan administration has taken any legal action against those who have allegedly aided and abetted human smuggling.
Witness Vithanage made the disclosure before the Commission under cross examination by Additional Solicitor General Neil Unambuwa PC.
