Wesley has slight edge over Joes today

Wesley College will once again go out as favourites as they have a slight edge over their opponents when they take on one of the most unpredictable teams this season in St. Joseph’s College Maradana in their Milo ‘A’ Division inter-school knockout rugby tournament quarterfinal match at the Sugathadasa Stadium today commencing 4.15pm.
Wesley kicked off this year’s season by losing to formidable Trinity College but went on to beat Prince of Wales Moratuwa, S. Thomas’ Mount Lavinia, Science College, Zahira Maradana, St. Peter’s Bambalapitiya and St. Joseph’s Maradana before losing to league champs Royal and league runners up Isipathana in the just concluded Singer league rugby tournament.
The Josephians started the season with two losses after close battles against Royal and Isipathana before beating Dharmaraja Kandy, St. Anthony’s Kandy, arch rivals St. Peter’s Bambalapitiya, D.S. Senanayake and S. Thomas’ Mount Lavinia before losing to Wesley and Trinity in the league. Meanwhile Wesley led by centre Avantha Lee will have to watch out for the opposition’s speedy three quarters and have to match their opponents really well to prevent winger Vinul Fernando’s St. Joseph from scoring through their famous three quarter moves.
The two forward packs are evenly matched, hence a close tussle for supremacy can be expected in today’s game and whoever win this encounter will have a semifinal berth next week with Dharmaraja, Kandy.
