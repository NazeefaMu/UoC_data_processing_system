Five Jaffna University students file FR  claiming religious rights

 
 
Five students including four Sinhala Buddhists and a Tamil Hindu of the Jaffna University yesterday filed a Fundamental Rights petition in the Supreme Court complaining that the university administration infringed their fundamental rights to conduct their religious observances within the campus premises.
The students who are attached to the Business Studies Faculty at the Vavuniya campus of the Jaffna University complain in the petition that the university administration is continuously harassing, victimising and penalising them by keeping them indefinitely out of bounds of the Vavuniya campus, for their suspected involvement in bringing a Budu Kutiya (wooden structure for the placement of a Buddha statue) to the Vavuniya campus.
The petitioners cited Jaffna University Vice Chancellor Prof. Ratnam Vigneswaran, Dr. T. Mangaleswaran, P. Priyadarshan and six others including the Higher Education Minister as respondents.
The petitioners stated that to celebrate the Vesak Poya which fell on April 29, they brought a Buddha statue and placed it in the Budu Kutiya. They alleged that the third respondent, a sub-warden asked them to remove it from the campus premises.
The petitioners further alleged that the university administration prevented them from pursuing their university education and sitting for the examination, subjecting them to excessive punishment not warranted by disciplinary procedure, by not granting any hearing to their appeals and by not releasing the Board of Inquiry Report and by not informing them of the decision of the Board of Inquiry.
The petitioners stated that freedom of thought, conscience and religion is the most important fundamental right of every person.
They further alleged that the respondents have infringed the fundamental rights of the petitioners to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution when they were penalised for expressing their views asserting their fundamental rights to conduct their religious observances within the campus premises.
This petition was filed through senior counsel Kalyananda Thiranagama and counsel Nilmal Wickremasinghe.
