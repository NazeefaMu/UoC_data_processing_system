Legend Herath bows out on a losing note

GALLE, Friday – All good things must come to an end and so it was with Rangana Herath, the greatest left-arm spinner Test cricket has produced who ended his 19-year international career at the end of the first cricket Test against England at the Galle International Stadium yesterday.
The match did not end the way Herath would have liked - with a win for Sri Lanka, but it was the reverse of what happened. England trounced Sri Lanka by 211 runs inside four days to take a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.
It was England’s biggest win over Sri Lanka since beating them at Lord’s by 137 runs in 1991, their first overseas win in 14 Tests since beating Bangladesh at Chittagong in 2016 and their first at Galle.
The entire Lankan team would be ashamed of themselves that they could not send a man who had bowled his country to innumerable number of victories on a high - with a win in his final Test match.
Nevertheless Herath was given a big send-off with his wife and two kids present on the podium where he received a commemorative coin, a couple of trophies and a shirt in appreciation of his services to Sri Lanka cricket. Herath took time at the end of the presentation to walk around the ground and thank his fans who have been supportive of him throughout his career. No doubt he was a great servant of the game, a humble cricketer and a gentleman to his finger tips.
Herath ended his career with a tally of 433 wickets (avg. 28.07) from 93 Tests finishing eighth in the all-time list equal with England fast bowler Stuart Broad who has played in 123 Tests.
The match ended when Herath in his final Test innings was run out for five and Sri Lanka chasing a daunting target of 462 folded up for 250.
It was another dispirited and spineless display of batting that saw Sri Lanka lose the Test. There was a lack of discipline and the shots the batsmen got out to, to say the least was appalling.
The top five batters had no excuse for the way they gifted their wickets to the England spinners who were made to look unplayable on a surface that was not doing much to cause any discomfort. All what was needed was for the batsmen to knuckle down and play a dogged innings to which none of the batsmen showed any capabilities of doing. The batters lacked tenacity to fight it out in the middle and gifted their wickets to strokes they would regret watching on replays. The second innings batting replicated their first innings when they were dismissed for 203.
An opening partnership of 50 was the best Sri Lanka could offer when a stand three times as much was needed. The top five batters all got starts but none managed to convert them into big ones as Player of the Match Ben Foakes and Keaton Jennings had done for England.
Sri Lanka were of course handicapped by the groin strain suffered by the captain Dinesh Chandimal who showed that he was clearly in discomfort when he could not stretch far enough to get to the pitch of the ball from Jack Leach and had his stumps rattled for one. It will be a big blow for Sri Lanka if they are to lose him for the rest of the series.
Angelo Mathews returning to the national team after being dropped for the ODI series on fitness grounds made twin half-centuries but that was not sufficient for a player of his experience and calibre when a big innings from him was required. Kusal Mendis reminds one of Aravinda de Silva’s early days. Just as when he seemed to be on top of the bowling he threw away his wicket trying to be too extravagant.
Of the 19 Sri Lankan wickets that fell to bowlers only two were claimed by the quicks Anderson and Curran the rest were consumed by the three England spinners Jack Leach, Adil Rashid and Moeen Ali who ended up with match figures of 8 for 137.
The day was enlivened by an English streaker running across the ground as soon as England had won. The second Test starts at Pallekele on November 14.
