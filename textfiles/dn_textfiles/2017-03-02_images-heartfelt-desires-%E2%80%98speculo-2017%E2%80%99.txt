Images of heartfelt desires ‘Speculo 2017’

An Art Exhibition is always something of an enigma. Because it comes from one’s spirit. It cannot be measured or compared in terms of quality or quantity. It is special because it is an image of a person’s mental faculties. An image of his emotions. The tiniest exhibition has some meaning, after all didn’t David kill Goliath?
Recently the Sri Lankan Airlines held their exhibition –‘Speculo 2017’ and event that drew a significant crowd being an art exhibition. Though in no means superior to any other exhibition, it was one that knocked on the door of one’s heart, asking to be allowed in, to be dissected and analyzed by a probing mind.
“The theme of this exhibition centers around, how people view Sri Lankan Airlines. We wanted to see their views expressed in the form of Art - in the form of imagery. This was a challenge. We did not force the participants in anyway, so what you see is completely original. There have been exhibits displayed by almost 80 seasoned and senior artists which shows the fervor and enthusiasm that this exhibition has generated. Also there has been a great response from students,” said Sri Lankan Airlines General Manager Marketing Saminda Perera
Perera pointed out that in terms of quantity and quality the exhibition certainly has significance. In terms of audience participation there really were a lot of attendees!
“The creations that came out of this endeavor are numerous and it has been very encouraging. Indeed the gallery is not large enough to display all these pictures numbering almost a 1000. This exhibition has received the fullest corporation from Sri Lankan Airlines, at the highest level. The credit must go to my team and my boss. Without their support I don’t think such a huge exhibition could have been held. Also the artists here have not had it easy, facing many difficulties. I too have benefited from this exhibition as it has broadened my horizons,” explained Perera.
Perera made special mention that it is heartening to know that some of the exhibits are that of prisoners. This makes the exhibition something special. It shows that prisoners are humans with minds of their own with feelings and ideas.
“We at Sri Lankan airlines love to do something new and something novel. So this exhibition comes from our heartfelt desire to do something out of the box. It has been a lot of hard work and effort,” added Perera.
