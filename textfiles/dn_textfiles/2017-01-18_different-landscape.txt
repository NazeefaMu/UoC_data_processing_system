In a different landscape

Singer-songwriter Lasith Fernando will be releasing his debut single ‘Mathaka Mal’ on January 21, 2017. He has made a name for himself as a working musician hustling the pub circuit of Colombo, performing in English.
In ‘Mathaka Mal’, a Sinhala rock song, Lasith reminisces about a love lost to the passage of time, the lingering fragrance that sits in his room, and the memories that still trail the road that he walks.
This song marks a shift into a different musical landscape, by attempting to write a song in Sinhala, while being influenced by ‘80s classic rock and contemporary pop-rock. His goal is to synthesize feelings into music in all their raw, honest glory.
Having mostly listened to Sinhala songs that his friends listened to or those in the theatre and on TV, his influences vary. If there is one Sinhala musician who has inspired him, it would be Amaradeva’s raw and visual songwriting, able to sing about something as simple as changing your sarong and it would still move you.
Growing up in his grandparents house on the outskirts of Dehiwela, Lasith remembers listening to his father playing Clarence Wijewardena and Jim Reeves cassettes, and his grandfather singing Frank Sinatra songs to himself.
Over the past three years, Lasith has been a staple of the Colombo music scene, hosting a very popular open mic amongst both musicians and pub-goers. Fostering a community of musicians who just love to entertain each other, he’s found a home for himself that is built on music. ‘Mathaka Mal’ will be the first song to step outside its doors into the world.
You can listen to the song online on YouTube by searching for “Mathaka Mal - Lasith Fernando” and purchase it at lasithfernando.bandcamp.com to support a young, local musician.
