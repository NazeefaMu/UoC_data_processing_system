New Bill to protect university standards

A new Bill regarding the protection of standards in universities will be presented to Parliament, said Leader of the House and Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella.
"New technology faculties will commence in universities to suit the modern world," he added. The Minister stated these views attending the foundation stone-laying ceremony for a new hostel to be constructed under the 'Sarasavi Medura' hostel project.
There is a great demand for students with technological knowledge; therefore, new technology faculties will be commenced in universities to suit the modern world. Plans have been made to introduce a Faculty of Medicine at the Wayamba University and Sabaragamuwa University, as well as a Faculty of Engineering at the University of Colombo and University of Sri Jayewardenepura.
"This is our government's policy. We have provided autonomy so that universities could produce graduates without any political interference. The reason for foreign universities to flourish is because of this autonomous concept. Each university has its own tradition; the traditions in the University of Colombo are different from the University of Sri Jayewardenepura," he said.
Commenting on the present flood situation in the country, the minister said, the Ministry of Higher Education and Highways has informed provincial directors, officers and district secretaries across the country to assist those in need as well as restore damaged roads.
Private contractors as well have volunteered to help in the removal of sand mounds, felled trees etc.
The hostel project inaugurated by the minister consists of three stages and will be constructed at the Pitipana premises of the University of Colombo hostel complex. Two hostels consisting of four storeys, each will be constructed at a cost of Rs. 488 million.
The hostel complex will comprise 200 rooms providing accommodation for 800 students annually.
the minister added: "our government is constantly involved in the development of universities as well as the accommodation of students. We have increased student grants and will solve hostel related problems by the end of 2018."
