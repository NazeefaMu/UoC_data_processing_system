Enlighten the law enforcement

The Supreme Court, in a landmark judgement, has declared that the fundamental rights of a British woman, who had the image of a Buddha tattooed on her upper arm, had been violated and offered her compensation, amounting to Rs. 800,000. Justice Anil Gooneratne, with Justices Eva Wanasundera and Nalin Perera, agreeing, awarded the petitioner, Naomi Michelle Coleman Rs. 500,000, payable by the State, and, Rs. 50,000, each, by Police Sergeant Upasena and Katunayake Police Acting OIC Inspector Suraweera. Court also awarded Rs. 200,000 as costs, payable by the state. It held that her fundamental right to freedom from torture, right to equality, and, freedom from arbitrary arrest, had been infringed upon. It also ruled that the magistrate had no right to make a deportation order, and, that, deportation of a foreigner is governed by the Immigration and Emigration Act and the power to make a deportation order is vested with the subject minister.
The SC, certainly, has delivered a resounding slap in the face of the country’s law enforcement, and its allied agencies, which, in this instance, had clearly overstepped their mark, and, assumed the role of a Religious Police, ala the fundamentalist Muslim theocracies, in the Middle East. The SC has made its ruling based on the country’s laws and it has come to a clear decision that Ms. Coleman had not infringed any law of this country. Besides, she had been a practising Buddhist, and, had been attending meditation retreats in Nepal, Thailand, Cambodia and India. It is as a tribute, and, as a personal expression of her devotion to Buddhist teaching that she had a tattoo displayed on her right upper arm of a Buddha, seated on a lotus flower, she told court.
Well, the police, which, arrested Ms. Coleman, for displaying a Buddha tattoo on her person, could not have been all that enamoured by Buddhism, given the treatment meted out to her, following her arrest. According to the petitioner, the prison guard, who was in charge, while at court, had made several lewd, obscene and disparaging remarks, of a sexual nature. The woman prison guard had also demanded a sum of Rs. 10,000 from her, and attempted to take her mobile phone. She was also subjected to a full body search, by a female officer, and that an inmate provided her a mat, to sleep for the night, with 60 other inmates sharing the room.
This, certainly, is outright harassment, of a foreigner, by the law enforcement, with the clear intention to extract financial benefit, making use of the opportunity, with any insult to Buddhism furthest from their minds. There is no other explanation for the ordeal Ms Coleman was subjected to, which, to say the least, was exceedingly disproportionate to the so called insult made to the Buddha, by the display of a tattoo of the Buddha image.
There certainly are insults galore, made to the Buddha, and, His noble teachings, in this country, under our very noses, with the so called custodians of the Buddha Dhamma, the worst offenders. We see Buddhist clergy descending to the level of street ruffians, joining unruly mobs, in protest demonstrations, hurling missiles and objects at the police, bringing disgrace and dishonour to the saffron robe. There was also the instance, where, a member of the Sangha, who had earned much notoriety, creating a scene at a courthouse, for which he was charged for Contempt of Court. How, Muslim establishments, and businesses, were attacked, by mobs, led by groups of Bikkhus, no doubt, is still fresh in the minds of the public, as, with attacks on Christian denominational churches. The actions by certain members of the Sangha, who spew out rabid racist sentiments, at public meetings, and, discourses, too, no doubt, would not be endorsed by the vast majority of Buddhists in this country, who adhere to the Buddha’s doctrine of ahimsa and tolerance.
We don’t need a Coleman to desecrate the image of Buddha. It is happening in this country, day in and day out, with the offenders being none other than those espousing the Dhamma from the roof tops. True Buddhism is not the external, but the inner sanctity and the purity of purpose, nourished by the pristine teachings of the Noble One. Buddhism, which has stood the test of time for millennia, in this country, cannot be belittled, or insulted, in anyway, by the display of a tattoo, or any other external symbol. One often comes across tattoos of the crucified Christ, on the inner forearm, or, the chest of Christians. No hue and cry is being made that this was an insult to Christ.
It is hoped that this landmark judgement will put paid to the practice of the law enforcement in this country overreacting to, what is after all, a normal feature in the liberal cultures of the West. This is not to say that any brazen insult to Buddhism, or, any other religion, for that matter, by visitors to this country, should be condoned. What is important is to act with circumspection.
