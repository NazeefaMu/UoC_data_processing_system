People can push country forward at elections: Duminda

Local government elections are scheduled to be held within another two months. When election was held, people could select a suitable, qualified persons for serving them. They get a golden opportunity at the elections to push the country on to the right track under the good governess government, Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake said.
The Minister was addressing the gathering after inaugurating the new multi-purpose building complex put up in the Nuwaragam Palatha (east) Divisional Secretariat. The new building comprises a preschool, daycare centre, public library, PHI and family health officers' offices. North Central governor P.B. Dissnayaka was present. The Minister said the two major political parties got together to mplement what a single party government could not accomplish - the tasks of national importance.
"Today bankrupted, corrupted and hypocrite politicians were busy in setting the country on fire on baseless issues harmful to the national unity, integrity, peace and order, agitating public," the Minister said.
He said the forthcoming elections would create a forum for peace loving people in all nationalities, religions and sects to put a fullstop to the unwarranted and indecent activities of these clans.
"Former leader Mahinda Rakapksa agreed to grant 13+ when he was armed with 2/3 majority. Today when the SLFP, UNP, JVP and theTamil alliance are attempting to establish permanent peace and harmony in the country through a new constitution, the so called leader once agreed and willing to offer 13+, shamelessly shouting that the institutions of a new constitution is hazardous, dangerous and fierce," the Minister said.
"This is purely a personal political agenda to get the private thing done and the voters should rise up against such hypocrisy and hood winking." he said.
The Minister said the indecent political leaders were trying to mislead even religious leaders including the Maha Sangha saying that the government was trying to withdraw the rights of the Buddhist and Buddhism in the new constitution. "It is utterly a false, baseless and ridiculous wrong interpretation of the proposed constitution," the Minister said.
"We ended the 35 years old war and terrorism at the gunpoint. Even after eight years passed since the war stopped, we have suspicion, doubt, hatred, misunderstanding among us since power greedy, rejected politician are backing up the evil powers and groups behind it to grab power," the Minister said.
"When a criminal has hacked a person, shot down or injured in the North, sometimes purely to gain personal ends, the opportunist, bankrupted politicians in the south are screaming that terrorism is rising up in the north. When same incidents are taking place in south, they are branded as personal or inter family disputers or altercations. The people should think twice before casting their precious votes for the right candidates, the Minister said.
