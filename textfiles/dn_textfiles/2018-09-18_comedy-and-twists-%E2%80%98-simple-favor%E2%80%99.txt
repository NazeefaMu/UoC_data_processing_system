Comedy and twists in  ‘A Simple Favor’

Paul Feig has become a major name in comedy over the years. His last four movies have been blockbusters: ‘Bridesmaids’, ‘The Heat’, ‘Spy and yes’, ‘Ghostbusters’. To some, his latest movie, ‘A Simple Favor’, may seem like something different, but it’s more of a Paul Feig movie than you may be expecting.
Based on the novel by Darcey Bell, the story follows single mom Stephanie (Anna Kendrick), who becomes friends with Emily (Blake Lively) when their sons have a playdate. One day, Emily asks Stephanie to pick up her son during a work emergency. Emily never returns, and this is just as surprising to Emily’s husband (Henry Golding). The plot thickens and the trailer definitely teases the film’s twists and turns, but there are still moments for macabre humour and outright silliness.
