Galaha hospital attack suspects remanded

Seven suspects resident at the Deltota Estate in Galaha who were arrested by the Galaha Police in connection with damages caused to public property and the vehicles of two doctors attached to the Galaha hospital during the recent mob attack on the hospital have been remanded.
The arrests were made on September 1 following investigations into the incident.
The mob attack followed the death of a one-and-a-half-year old boy admitted to hospital in a critical condition on August 29.
Following the boy’s death, a mob of over 10,000 people stormed hospital and went on the rampage damaging public property and held the medical officer in charge hostage for over 10 hours. Police managed to take the doctor to safety getting him to wear a police uniform to disguise as a Police officer.
Thereafter, Central Province Health Services Director Dr. Shanthi Samarasinghe instructed two investigation teams to ascertain whether the death was caused due to negligence of the doctors and assess the damage caused to public property.
Dr. Samrasinghe said hospital staff other than doctors would be asked to report to work at the Galaha hospital from today. But, doctors have refused to take up duties at the hospital.
The doctors on duty at the hospital on the day of the incident have been transferred to the Health Services Director’s Office with immediate effect.
Police conducting investigations with the help of video clips obtained by people are due to arrest more suspects.
The Peradeniya Inquirer Into Sudden Deaths who held the inquest in to the child’s death recorded an open verdict and sent body parts of the deceased to the Government Analyst for examination and a report. Police investigations are continuing.
