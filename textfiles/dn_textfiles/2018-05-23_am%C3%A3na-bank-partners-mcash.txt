Amãna Bank partners  with mCash

Marking yet another significant milestone in its journey, Amãna Bank has partnered with mCash, one of Sri Lanka’s leading payment platforms offered by Mobitel, thereby facilitating the Bank’s customers with a convenient solution to pay a host of utility and service bills at the comfort of the Bank’s branch.
Through this partnership, both customers of the Bank as well as the public can walk in to any of the Bank’s 28 branches located island-wide and settle their mobile bills, water bills, electricity bills (CEB and LECO), satellite TV bills as well as institutional payments. This partnership further facilitates customers willing to donate to charity projects such Helpage and SOS Children’s Village.

Customers can now easily carry out a multitude of payment transactions in addition to other banking transactions, thereby saving time for the customer.”
