Moving beyond traditions

“In any field for one to shine, it is extremely important to build an image, have inborn talents and also dedication and experience to one’s profession. Especially for a beautician, it is important to carve out a unique style and builds one’s own identity to go on a long journey in the beauty culture profession”, well known beautician and Make-up Artist at the Independent Television Networks Ltd (ITN) Shammi Dharshana Perera stated.
He has already built his own identity by making use of his experience, innovations and ability to move beyond traditions and combining all such qualities to bring out his talents in different fields at his salon the Bridal Saloon which is at No-40/2A, Veediya Bandara Mawath, Ethul Kotte. Today he has mastered the art of beauty culture, bridal dressing, make-up & hair styles to win a name locally and internationally. He has become a distinctive artist in his field thanks to his ability to mix innovation to produce exclusive bridal dressing, make-up and hair styles which attract a range of clientele. He is popular in the field with his thirst to do something a new after making use of latest trends in the field.
Despite his skills, his other attributes such as delivering on time, charming personality and helpful attitude has enabled him to secure a top most place for him in his respective field.
Each and every single bride who comes to him is special. He has no problem with their outlook. All he needs is to make each one a star on the best day of their lives. When a client comes seeking his services, the way he should adorn her comes to mind naturally. He has a 10-year-experience in this field and is keeping on improving in it. He explains to a bride what is suitable according to her outer appearance and the skin tone and designs them in accordance with their age, ideas, opinions and choice. It is very easy to work with the younger generation. They have knowledge of modern day trends.
Shammi came to this field almost by accident. He was involved in the drama & theater field until he got a chance to join the ITN as a trainee Make-up Artist. He obtained his basic theory and practical knowledge in proper manner during the two years of his probation period. He feels this talent flows in his veins and learnt it properly. Now he has established and created his own image in the field. He applies make-up to around 10-15 persons daily including presenters, models, actors on ITN instead of bridal dressing. He believes that the more you do it the better you get. Today he has a clientele covering international and local markets and has his own Salon in Ethul Kotte. Certain beauticians do not accept brides who are not beautiful but this should not be a quality of a good beautician. All brides are beautiful but what we have to do is beautifying them according to their skin tone.
When he meets a bride to be, he first congratulates her and asks the date fixed for the wedding. Generally it is easy if a bride contacts the beautician at least five months early. Then they have time to go for an exclusive design.
Thereafter, he starts the course of changing the outlook. If she is overweight they start by helping her to reduce weight and treating her skin. He usually has brides bring photos of any hair or make-up ideas they have so he gets a general idea of their interests. They talk about the dress style, flowers, general colors throughout the wedding and environment (indoors or outdoors). This gives a chance to evaluate what he’s working with and then start designing the dress with their opinions.
Later they start with light make-up application and build to the intensity that the bride wants. Main focuses are on eyes, skin and hair color for natural guidelines for makeup choice. He tries to harmonize the dress, flower, eye, skin, and hair color together for an overall completed look. After that they begin styling the hair and try to compliment the face shape and style it appropriately with the headpiece.
A bride should always be concerned about maintaining her body. Develop a skincare regiment and be faithful about it - cleanse, tone and moisturise. Drink lots of water. Get plenty of rest. Get a trim on the ends of their hair 2 weeks prior to the big day. Plan the wedding as early as possible without leaving it to another day so that there would be no final hour rush. Distribute the responsibilities among near and dear ones and stay free of stress and be happy. If the brides can stay without stress she does not need a facial.
The atmosphere of the salon he works at is very casual. He’s faithful to his work, came far owing to the sacrifices he made. This is not only about money as he enjoys what he does. He also accrues lot of merit by helping others to be happy in their most important day of lives by making them beautiful.
