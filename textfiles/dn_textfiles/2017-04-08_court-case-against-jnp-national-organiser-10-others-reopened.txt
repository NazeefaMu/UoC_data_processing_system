Court case against JNP National Organiser, 10 others reopened

A case against Kalutara District Parliamentarian and Jathika Nidahas Peramuna National Organiser Jayantha Samaweera and nine others was reopened by Panadura Additional Magistrate Calhari Liyanage on a motion filed before Court by the Wadduwa Police.
Panadura Chief Magistrate Chaminda Liyanage discharged them in March, 2017 from the case due to non-availability of statements made by the complainant to the Panadura Police regarding the special inquiry ordered by the then IGP in 2006.
The Sub Inspector who recorded the statements of Karunawathi Thantikrige had been retired and died subsequently. The Wadduwa police brought the situation to the notice of the Panadura SSP and obtained the permission to reopen the case by filing a motion before Court as sufficient evidence is available although the complainant’s statements were missing from the police.
The Additional Magistrate summoned the 10 accused before Court and informed them that the case was reopened. The trial was fixed for April 24.
Kalutara District Parliamentarian Samaraweera Arachchige Jayantha Jayasiri Rodrigo alias Jayantha Samaweera and his father S. A. Gunadasa Rodrigo, Angerge Sunny Perera, Angerge Rasika Pradeep Perera Angerge Sirisena Perera, M. D. Prabath Calhara Perera, Noel Prabath Chandralal, K. Ariyawansa Perera, M.
