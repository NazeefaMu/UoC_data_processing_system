Digital marketing takes centrestage at LBR LBO brand summit

LBR LBO brand summit 2017 held yesterday at Cinnamon Grand brought into discussion the new trends of marketing away from the traditional idea of marketing. The summit consisted of five sessions with marketing specialists discussing the evolution of marketing and its affects on the consumer.
PickMe CEO Jiffry Zulfer said the company was able to record 10 million rides from across the country in the last financial year. Zulfer said that Pick me currently has 10,000 vehicles registered.
A key note speaker at the LBR LBO brand summit, he said their biggest competition was with personal vehicle uses. PickMe, according to Zulfer is catering to the mobility industry.
“We aren’t just a taxi company, our aim is to reduce the amount of vehicles in the road by providing people with a more cost effective option. So they can move from location A to B with ease,” Zulfer said speaking to Dailly News.
He said that PickMe, with the introduction of one new vehicle, takes three personal vehicles off the road. He said that the way to increase this is through, ‘individualisation’. PickMe is currently one of the few profit making companies in the region and they were positively affected by the entering of Uber into the market.
The discussion of the panels was dominated by discussions on the digital. The discussion was diverted into the concept of ‘Marketing in the digital age’ as opposed to ‘Digital Marketing’. It was discussed that marketing in the digital arena is consumer centric; running on the specialised data of individuals.
The necessity of “Hyper-individualization” was discussed in length. It was also mentioned that though it is a popular belief that technology is cantered around the western province, modern data states that the technology shift is moving towards less urban locations. People today are moving to digital in all aspects, even banking, travelling and shopping.
Digital marketing is not complete without proper content to support it. The summit discussed the importance of syncing multiscreen through content to form discussions with the consumers.
