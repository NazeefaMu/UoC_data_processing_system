Three national ruggerites to join CH & FC ?

Three top national ruggerites – former St. Peter’s College Bambalapitiya rugby vice captain and Sri Lanka under 20 Asian sevens cup champion centre Nishone Perera, ex-Isipathana College vice captain/Sri Lanka national sevens centre/winger Hirantha Perera and Isipathana College/Sri Lanka national sevens utility three-quarter player Sudam Sooriyarachchi have joined CH and FC and will most probably turn out for the Maitland Crescent club in the upcoming 2018/19 rugby season, it is learnt.
The CH and FC rugby team under Rohitha “Chichi” Rajapaksa finished fourth in last year’s league championship and will try their utmost to bring back the title to Maitland Crescent in the upcoming 2018/19 rugby season after 18 years under the guidance of head coach Samoan Thevita ‘Laga’ Thulagaese.
