Janashakthi Life Continues to  Deliver Steady Growth in Q3

Janashakthi Insurance PLC continued on its growth journey registering a Gross Written Premium (GWP) ofRs.2.2 billion as at September 30, 2018. The Insurer ended the period under review with post-tax profits of Rs.7.4billion, including the gains from the sale of Janashakthi General Insurance Limited.
The Company’s investment income stood at Rs.1,125 million, growing by 14% over the Rs.984 million registered in Q3, 2017. This was primarily due to the 26% growth in its investment portfolio which stood at Rs.15.6 billion at the end of the period under review. Net claims and benefits increased from Rs.849 million to Rs.1,066 million, largely due to policy maturities of Life Investment products.
“In 2018, we have focused our effort on restructuring and reorganising our operations as a standalone Life Insurance business .Building on the momentum gained during the first half of the year, I am pleased to report that Janashakthi Life has continued to grow steadily during the third quarter of 2018, starting to reap the benefits of many of the strategic initiatives put in place throughout the first nine months of the year,” said Prakash Schaffter, Managing Director of Janashakthi Insurance PLC.
“In early November, we set up our new Life Headquarters in Colombo 02, which we hope will provide our team with a space to grow both personally and professionally, while delivering results for the Company. With the completion of our ongoing expansion and digital-led transformation efforts by the end of the year, we are geared to drive the business forward and emerge as a significant player in the country’s Life Insurance industry,” said Jude Fernando, Director / Chief Executive Officer of Janashakthi Insurance PLC.
