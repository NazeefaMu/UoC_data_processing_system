Fragrance file

Wearing a fragrance is a distinctive way of expressing yourself. Your choice of perfume, too, conveys a lot about your personality. They increase your level of attractiveness, increase confidence levels, reduce stress levels, and double your chances of capturing the attention of your love interest.
 
Choosing a fragrance for someone else 
 
There are so many things to consider when shopping for a fragrance as a gift. The first thing I always think about is their personality. For instance, are they cheerful, bright and bubbly? If so, perhaps an uplifting, summery citrus based perfume might suit them. Alternatively if they are very career focused with a dry, dark sense of humour, then perhaps something a little more structured and woodsy might work for them.
 
Key areas on the body to spray on a fragrance 
 
Perfumes are supposed to be worn on the body, generally on the pulse points, e.g. inside of the wrists, back of the neck, behind the ears, etc. Never spray them on clothes. The oils present in the perfumes will definitely stain your clothes. Also prevent it from mixing with your natural fragrance.

Apply your perfume to these points - the inner wrists, the base of the throat, behind ear lobes, in the cleavage, behind knees, and the inner elbows. As you wear your perfume throughout the day, it will react with your body heat and continue to emit scent.
 
Same fragrance smelling different on different people 
 
The primary reason for a perfume to smell different on different people is because everyone has a unique body chemistry and no two are the same (as far as we know!) When the perfume molecules react with the warm pulse points through our heart beat, it also causes a reaction with our skin and hormones which causes the perfume to give off a particular smell.
 
Becoming immune to your scent 
 
It is possible to become immune to your scent so that you can no longer feel its smell. After wearing a particular fragrance for a long period it is possible that we get use to the way it smells and become immune to the smell.
 
Qualities of a good perfume 
 
* The scent of the perfume should be smelled as soon as a perfume is sprayed, rolled or applied.
* The scent of the perfume should be smelled around the wearer.
* The more long-lasting perfumes generally have better quality.
 
 
Expiry period of a perfume 
 
From the time it is produced, a typical bottle of perfume has an average shelf life of three to five years. This shelf life may be longer if the bottle is unopened and stored properly. Perfumes with a higher concentration of alcohol or water may disappear more quickly through evaporation.
 
Making natural perfumes at home 
 
It is always best to buy your perfume from reputed brands because trying to make your own perfume may cause allergic reactions. However there are many organic perfumes available now if one wants to use natural ingredients.
