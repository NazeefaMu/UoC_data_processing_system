Bradby the most looked forward to game

In our country rugby is not something that generally springs readily to mind. It is better known for cricket, tea exports and the recently ended civil war. But Sri Lanka’s British colonial forefathers left behind more than cricket as a sporting staple.
Rugby was introduced to Sri Lanka in the late 1800s, and today it boasts a large playing population and a television audience of millions.
The Bradby Shield encounter - popularly called “The Bradby” - is the highlight of the Sri Lanka’s school’s rugby calendar. It is played annually between traditional rivals Royal College, Colombo, and Trinity College, Kandy. The encounter consists of two legs, one being played in Colombo, and the other in Kandy.
The winner is decided on the aggregate of the scores from these two matches, usually played a few weeks apart. The Bradby was generally played in late July or early August and is the most watched rugby match in the country, drawing more spectators than either inter-club or even international fixtures.
The first historic match was played on July 31, 1920. This was made a yearly encounter, with Trinity winning for the first in 21 years. In 1945, the principal of Royal College, E. L Bradby, put forward the idea of playing an annual two-match series, to which the principal of Trinity College C.E. Simithraarachy, readily agreed. To ensure the success of the series, Principal E.L. Bradby offered a shield which was to be held for a period of one year by the winner of the series. The series has been played annually and uninterrupted ever since.
Two land marks in this historic series prior to the 1945 are – Royal’s first ever win over Trinity was in 1941, their victories over Trinity in the first two match series was in 1943 – the 2nd match bringing Royal their first win in Kandy.
The Shield is a wooden disk decorated with intricate workings depicting traditional Kandyan art and craftsmanship. On winning the series, the Shield is presented to the winning team’s captain at an award ceremony held on the playing field immediately following the end of the second leg.
The first Bradby Shield teams: Trinity - A. Ratwatte, S. Mediwake, A. Yatawara, J. Kuruwita, P.S. Dedigama, T.B. Madugalle, S.B. Pilapitiya, R.G. Sourja (Capt), H. Jones, R. Vanculenberg, G. Sanmugam, H. Ranasinghe, R.V. Moottsam, K.A. Gunawardene, W.Thurasitratnam. Royal - M. Kassipillai, R.M.S. de Silva, A.C.M. Nizar, N.W. Karunaratne, U. Amerasinghe, R. Rajaratnam, M. Rodrigo, D.R. Amerasinghe, J.M. Cumaraswamy, L. Kumarasinghe, D de Moor, F.D Schoorman, C,D.L. Fernando (Capt), T. Mukherjee, S.V. Edirimanasinghe. Royal won 3-0 the first leg played in Colombo. Referee Sydney G. de Zoysa.
Sad day for Rahul
Trinity skipper Rahul Karunathilake after two yellow cards in the Thomian game has been barred from playing in the first leg of the Bradby. This may be the first time that a captain has been deprived of playing. What a sad affair.

Pujith Jayasundara started his sports in Kandy
Pujith Senadhi Bandara Jayasundara who took office as the 34th Inspector General of Police was a fine sportsman. He played cricket for Dharmaraja College as an opening batsman and was also a top bowler. He played for the Rajans for four years. He was also an athlete, hockey player and footballer. He represented the Police at cricket, football and hockey. A keen follower of sports, he believes that sports are the great leveler and the best medicine for policemen and the public to understand each other.

After his playing days, he gave big support for Police sports, especially football, hockey, cricket and basketball. At one time he was a livewire of the Sri Lanka Football Federation.
Kandy Police to bring back sports
Kandy Police who dominated sports like football, hockey, cricket, and volleyball and cue sport are keen to promote them again. They have their own sports ground which has helped many sportsmen and sportswomen in and around Kandy for the last 75 years.
For this idea a big hand should go to all the top Police officers past and present who were in Kandy. They were all sports lovers who helped most of the schools like Dharmaraja College, Kingswood College, Vidyartha College, and St. Sylvester’s College and St. Paul’s College (now Sri Sumangala) to perform all their sports, specially cricket, football, hockey and athletics. In the early days Police Constable S.M. David was in charge. The first game of hockey was played at this ground in 1905 when it was under the Army and known as the Army Barracks.
