Fine line between politicians and officials
As public officials we have to work with ministers of various temperaments and behaviours. One incident comes to my mind when serving in the Department of Public Works (PWD) where the Minister was Cholamondalay Gunawardena. When he took up office, I had the opportunity to work closely with him, as I was handling the subject of improvements to minor roads. This was the main subject of all Members of Parliament to meet the Minister to get minor roads developed in their electorates.
Over our first encounter, the minister told me: “I know you are not a supporter of my political party [LSSP], but that does not anyway concern me. But when I want something done, you should come out with any problem why my order cannot be carried out and then we will discuss and solve and if not possible – drop it.” That was an encouragement for me to be honest with him and speak out.
Once an MP from an upcountry electorate met the minister and wanted a village road to be taken over to the PWD. I told him that there is no provision in the Thoroughfare Ordinance for the PWD to takeover, unless the Village Council concerned makes a request. The problem here was that the VC was under UNP administration and the MP was insisting, perhaps prestige. At this time of discussion, in walked Dr Colvin R de Silva. Hailing him, the minister said: “Here comes the legal luminary,” to which Dr Colvin said: ‘Here is your minister whose name sounds different to its spelling - Spelt Cholomondalay but sounds Chomley. After this hilarious introduction, he was told of the problem we were facing. He took the Ordinance, which I had and after going through, he said: “Your official is right.” Then he gave a solution, and that was to write to the Chairman of the VC concerned saying if the road is not handed over, that the PWD will get the Minister’s authority to compulsorily take over.
When I said there was no such provision, he smiled and said that is another ruse. You try it. When I told this to the Director PWD, he said he would not sign such an illegal letter. However, I rang the Executive Engineer of the area and explained the situation. I suggested to him to meet the Chairman and tell him to say to the villagers that he is handing over the road to the PWD, for metalling and tarring and then the credit would go to him.
That worked, and the road was taken over with the engineer himself had confirmed to the villagers that the work is undertaken on the request of the Chairman.
When I showed the letter of consent of the Chairman, he was delighted and thanked me and said: “That’s how we should work.”
I have worked closely with Ministers and all of them were very understanding and accepted the public officers’ views, except the last I had to work.
