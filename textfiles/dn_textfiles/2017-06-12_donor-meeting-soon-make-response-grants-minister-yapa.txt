Donor meeting soon to make response grants: Minister Yapa

Japan recommends basin-based Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) strategy
Top-down early warning systems for disaster prone districts

The government will hold a donor meeting shortly with all stakeholders involved in disaster mitigation to establish protocols and systems for making response grants needed to build disaster resilience, Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa told the Daily News yesterday.
The minister said the Japanese Disaster Relief Expert Team members that visited districts affected by landslides and flooding due to the recent rain-triggered disaster, has provided them with technical advice for responsive measures.
“They have recommended in their final report the need to invest in a Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) strategy based on river basins to prevent loss of livelihoods, assets and loss of lives,” he said.
“They have recommended that measures be taken to set up early warning systems and spotlighted promotion of resettlement away from potential risk prone areas in some cases,” he explained .
Thanking Japan for its cooperation and closely working with the government, Yapa said the basin based Disaster Risk Reduction strategy and the recommended investment in it focuses on sustainable development.
“We are going to call a donor meeting with the participation of all stakeholders in flood- and landslide prone districts, such as the government agents, the governors, district authorities, first of all for the identification of disaster reduction priorities in them for programming an action plan to address their vulnerabilities and exposure to disasters on a sustainable footing ,” he said.
“The vulnerabilities are being assessed for this purpose by relevant regional authorities at present,” he said.
Asked if the government had paid compensation to those disaster victims whose houses have been fully or partially damaged by the floods, Yapa said they are taking care of everything.
He said the damages have to be assessed before moneys can be granted in the case of houses that have been devastated.
“There is no need to worry over rebuilding for we are doing it successfully. Most importantly the flood victims are being looked after by the government, they have been sheltered, food and water been given, medicinal needs taken care of at the time,” he said.
“Flood relief is going to them directly. Most importantly the challenge is that we have to put them in a better position when the next disaster strikes,” he pointed out.“In the meantime short-term recovery is being addressed,” he said.
“We are going to establish an early warning system which will have access even to villages as per recommendations of the Japanese Disaster Relief Expert Team’s report as part of our strategy to address disaster vulnerabilities in the country on a national footing,” he added.
