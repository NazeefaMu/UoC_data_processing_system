Maliban, SLT enter finals

Maliban Biscuits and Sri Lanka Telecom booked their berths to play in the final of the 7th Stafford Motor Co. (Pvt) Ltd., sponsored 'Honda' Trophy, MCA 'G' division 25 Over League Tournament 2017.
In the semi finals played over last week-end at the MCA grounds, Maliban flexed their muscles with a comfortable 07 wickets win over Avery Dennison on Saturday and on Sunday, Sri Lanka Telecom made a great escape before beating HNB 'B' by 31 runs.
Maliban Vs. Avery Dennison: Maliban spin twins, Chamara Ratnayake (4-1-11-4) and Anjula Perera (5-28-3) spun a deadly web around Avery Dennison batsman and as a result they shot out for a paltry 84 runs in 22 overs. Maliban shed little sweat on reaching their target in 15.1 overs, losing only 03 wickets.
SLT Vs. HNB 'B': HNB’s paceman, Mohamed Ikram put SLT in a precarious position, bagging the first 03 wickets for zero runs. Two more wickets fell and SLT was looking down the barrel at 17 for 5.
Kalpa Bandaranayake was the SLT batsman that slayed the dragon with a fighting 85 runs partnership in 59 balls for the 6th wicket with Suranga Wijeratne. Bandaranayake made a valiant 71 runs in 40 balls hitting 4 sixes and 08 fours while Wijeratne held the other end scoring 31 runs, as SLT made a face saving 159 for 9 in 25 overs. HNB despite some good batting by D. Panditharatne (42) and G.Hondamunige (39) fell by the post all out for 128 runs with a ball to spare. The bowlers who were responsible on putting the bankers on the wrong side of the ledger were – Jagath Siriwardena (3/36), Kalpa Badaranayake (2/28) and Malinda Perera (2/15)
The final between Maliban Biscuits and Sri Lanka Telecom will take place on August 12 at the MCA grounds at 10.00 am.
