Rare comet lights up Christmas skies

Sri Lankan astronomy enthusiasts will have a rare opportunity to observe a comet in the eastern sky soon after sunset in the constellation of Taurus these days. The comet 46P/Wirtanen, a space rock which is only 1.2 kilometers in diameter was first observed in January 17, 1948 by American astronomer Carl A.Wirtanen.
This small comet with an orbital period of only 5.4 years came as close as 11.4 million kilometers to earth and became one of the 10 closest comets which flew by earth in the past 70 years.
The comet will be clearly visible through binoculars and small telescopes as well. Furthermore, the comet can be photographed easily using a DSLR camera. This image was captured in Colombo by Dhamsith Asiri Weerasinghe from the Old Nalandian Astronomical Society. The comet can be seen in green in the center of the photograph. The open star cluster Pleiades (M45) is also visible in the upper right corner as well.
