Rubaiyat  misunderstood?

The name of the Persian poet Omar Khayyam (1050 – 1132), his celebrated work Rubaiyat and the English translator of the work Edward Fitzgerald (1809 – 1883) have become catchwords in literary world both in the Occident as well as the Orient. There is quite a number of reasons for the fame of Omar and his work Rubaiyat via the English translation. In Sri Lanka, three Sinhala translations have appeared over the years.
The Sinhala translators happened to be Madawala Ratnayake, G B Senanayake and Mahagama Sekara. Though the first two translators brought out published works, the translation on the part of Sekara, appeared in several editions in the Sinhala periodical titled Rasavahini during the late sixties. During a visit to Hyderabad in India, I came across an Indian publication of Fitzgerald’s translation of Rubaiyat.
Religious sensibility
I was inclined to reread Rubaiyat due to two reasons. The first reason is that there was a belief among some of the English scholars, that Omar’s work Rubaiyat possesses a deep sense of the oriental religious sensibility of hte metaphysical nature of the existence. This underlines the transience or aniccha quality as taught in Buddhism as well. It is true that some of the quatrains in Rubaiyat as they are denoted by Fitzgerald tend to express the essence of the phenomenon. Take for instance the following lines.
“Here with a loaf of bread beneath the bough
A flask of wine, a book of verse and thou,
Beside me, singing in the wilderness
And wilderness is paradise now.” (Verse 11)
“The worldly hope men set their hearts upon,
Like snow upon the desert’s dusty face,
Lighting a little hour or two – is gone.” (Verse 14)
As is widely known Edward Fitzgerald was not a mere poet who scribbled for the sake of doing it. But he was a scholar of some magnitude. At Oxford University, Fitzgerald was tutored by an oriental scholar named Edward Byles Cowell, who later became Professor of Sanskrit at Cambridge. He was the scholar who induced Fitzgerald to study Spanish and Persian. It is recorded that in 1856, Cowell discovered the Rubaiyat or quatrains of Omar Khayyam in a Persian manuscript in the Bodleian library at Oxford.
First edition
He made a transcript of it to be given to Fitzgerald. Further it is recorded that in 1857, lie latter began the translation completing it in six months time. One fascinating factor is that a periodical titled as Frazer’s Magazine, has refused to publish a few selections of the stanzas.
On April 9, 1859, the fir book edition of Rubaiyat in 250 copies came to be printed and produced at Fitzgerald’s expense.
The work in English hardly caught the sight of scholars though it was price marked at Shilling a copy in London bookshops. The first edition had been lying in the bookstalls nearly for two years, and was finally ‘dumped at a penny a copy. Then suddenly the merit of the work was discovered by several scholars whose names go as the Poets Rosetti , Swinburne, Burne-Jones, William Morris, Ruskin and others.
The work was introduced to American scholars by Charles Eliot Norton. This blissful trend of events became a mania which swept the world.
This I feel is sufficient background to feel the necessity of Rubaiyat in the world of letters. But, what really was the success of Rubaiyata as translated into English? On rereading I felt that the stream of visions that envelope the brief poetic quality or the underlying sensitivity that expresses the inner feelings of a man in varying forms. The poetic persona or the narrator in the poems tends to transcend the barriers mere material world full of lust, anger and hatred. He tends to take a move towards a better blissful moment. See the following lines.
“Ah make the most of what we yet may spend,
Before we too into dust descend
And under dust to lie
Sans wine, sans song, sans singer and sans end.” (Verse 23)
Meaning of life
Omar Khayyam seems to be expressing the deep sense of happiness as the essence of life. He feels that his poetic persona, whom he identifies as a philosopher feels the great sense of tranquillity while meaning of life.
As such, the work as a whole transcends the conventional barriers of love and romance. Omar, as a poet, takes the reader of his verses to a flame of metaphysical belief akin to some of the stanzas found in Bhagavadgita and Dhammapada. The world is seen as a mirage and or a bubble of water.
“Earth could not answer.
Nor the seas that mourn.”
Oh threats of hell and hopes
One thing is certain and the rest are lies.
The flower that once, blown forever dies.
(Verse 63).
Though seemingly expressed in a lighter symbolic vein some poems in Rubaiyat embrace a deeper sense. One good example is Verse 51.
The moving finger writes and having writ,
Moves on, not all thy piety nor wit
Shall lure it back to cancel half a line
Not all they tears wash out a word of it.
The idea conveyed is more spiritual than it shows on the outer layer. It is the deep sense of engraving that is irreversible as in the paths of the enlightened ones. The lines denote the paths and those who follow the lines or the path achieve the goal of perfection discernible either as the highest spiritual achievement. In this sense, the Rubaiyat of Omar Khyyam ought to be rediscovered sensibly.
It is observed that there have been several versions of the translation of Fitzgerald, which he may have improved over the years. As such I had the chance of reading three versions where the first had come to light in 1859 the second in 1868, and the fifth in 1889. One finds quite a number of allusions to myth, legends, religious allegories passed down the centuries especially in the ancient world of Persians. Poetry commences in delight and ends in wisdom comes as truism as you scan the pages of Rubaiyat. On rereading Rubaiyat I felt that it is more spiritual poetic vision than an ephemeral expression of sensory pleasures with an emphasis on drinking. As such, the widely believed attribution to Rubaiyat needs to be dispelled.
