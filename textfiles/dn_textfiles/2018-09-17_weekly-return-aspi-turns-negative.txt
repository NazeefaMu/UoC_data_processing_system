Point of view
Equities ended the week on a negative note for the 1st time in 4 weeks as concerns over a currency crisis (prompted by a report from Japanese investment bank Nomura) spooked investors. Despite a healthy recovery of ~108 points since 28th August (from its 17-Month low of 6010.23 points), the W-o-W loss on heavy weight stocks such as JKH (-3.26%),Commercial Bank (-3.31%), Distilleries (-6.28%) & Sampath Bank (-3.81%) dragged the ASPI down by ~87 points (or 1.42%) during the week. The YTD loss on the ASPI consequently widened further to 5.9% (cf. 4.6% till last week). A subsequent correction by the Nomura regarding an error in its short term external debt repayment calculation for Sri Lanka however, helped calm markets to some extent and despite the losses on the Index, activity levels in the market recovered during the week.
Weekly turnover consequently increased ~227% to Rs.4.4Bn from Rs.1.3Bn last week, helped by Janashakthi’s acquisition of 31.14% of Dunamis Capital on Wednesday at Rs.36.60. Meanwhile, Local HNI and Institutional investors returned to equities during the week, resulting in crossings for the week rising to ~64% of total market turnover (cf. 30% last week).
Transactions on Dunamis Capital accounted for ~50% of the week’s total crossings and 33% of the weekly turnover. In addition, Local HNI and Institutional investors were also interested in blue-chip JKH (~13% of the crossings) and Sri Lanka’s largest retailer Cargills (~14% of the crossings). The foreign equity sell-off on the bourse meanwhile increased during the week as foreign investors recorded a net outflow of Rs.564Mn cf. Rs.64Mn last week.
JKH lead the net foreign sales with ~Rs.640Mn while Sampath bank accounted for Rs.84Mn. Markets in the week ahead are likely look for cues from economic and political developments, including Q2’18 GDP growth figures.
Brent crude oil falls 2% from 3m high
Global oil price headed for a weekly gain, with benchmark Brent crude oil reaching its highest level of $80.13/bbl. since mid-May 2018 on Wednesday. Although commodity prices have been on a declining trend since early-July, oil prices were buoyed by a fresh round of global oil supply concerns as U.S. crude oil inventories dwindled to a 31/2 year low, falling by 5.3Mn barrels last week.
Risks to demand (such as heightening trade tensions between the U.S. China) were overshadowed by the oil market’s focus on fears of supply shortages (due to slowing crude oil production growth) and threats of Iranian sanctions. Iranian production has fallen to its lowest since July 2016, at 3.63Mn barrels a day.
Despite Wednesday’s 3-month high, shifting oil market perceptions led Brent crude oil falling 2% on Thursday to settle at $78.18 per barrel as investors focused on the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) warning of mounting global economic risks for oil demand from challenges in emerging markets such as currency depreciation versus the dollar and trade disputes.
In its latest monthly oil report, IEA warned that the oil market is entering a “very crucial period” and predicted that the market could break out above $80 a barrel unless oil producers meet the shortfall from Iran and Venezuela.
The upward movement in oil prices is likely to further worsen Sri Lanka’s trade deficit which rose to $5.7Bn between Jan-Jun 2018(cf. $4.8Bn in Jan-Jun’17) amid higher import prices and volumes of crude oil and refined petroleum products. CPC import prices of crude in July rose to $78.76/bbl compared to an average of $74.96/bbl between Jan-Jun’18 reflecting the upwards movement in oil prices and the potential impact on the country’s Q3’18 trade deficit.
