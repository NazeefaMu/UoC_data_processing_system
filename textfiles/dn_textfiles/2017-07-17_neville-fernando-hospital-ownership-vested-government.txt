Neville Fernando Hospital ownership vested with the government

 
Agreements to transfer the ownership of the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital to the government were signed before President Maithripala Sirisena a short while ago.
The Teaching Hospital will officially open on August 01, this year.
Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said that once the ownership of the hospital is transferred, patients will be provided quality health service for free.
