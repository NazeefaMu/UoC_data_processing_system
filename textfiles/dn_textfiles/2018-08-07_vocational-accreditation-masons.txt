Vocational Accreditation for masons

A tripartite Memorandum of Understanding was signed at the Ministry of Science, Technology, Research, Skills Development, and Vocational Training and Kandyan Heritage to enable 4500 young masons in Sri Lanka to be awarded an internationally acceptable vocational accreditation.
The three parties to the MoU are the National Apprentice and Industrial Training Authority (NAITA), National Enterprise Development Authority (NEDA) and INSEC cement.
The young masons who would have already received a basic traditional training under master masons will be selected from all over the country. They will be put through a very brief programme of further formal training.
Thereafter those who pass a qualifying test will be made eligible to sit the examination conducted by NAITA to award the National Vocational Qualification Framework (NVQ) Level 3 accreditation examination. Those who are successful will be awarded the NVQ Level 3 certificate which is an internationally accepted vocational qualification.
NAITA which will award the certificate is an organization under the Ministry of Science, Technology, Research, Skills Development, and Vocational Training and Kandyan Heritage. This programme has been inaugurated by NAITA with the support of the other two institutions under the Minister’s new initiative of an accelerated programme of vocational training for Sri Lankan youth. The MoU was signed by the Heads of the 3 institutions, in the presence of Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama.
