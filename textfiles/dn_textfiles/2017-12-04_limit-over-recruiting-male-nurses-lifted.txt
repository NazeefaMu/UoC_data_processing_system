Limit over recruiting male nurses lifted

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne is to amend the five percent limit on recruiting male nurses to the Government service, Health Ministry spokesman said.
Minister Senaratne said this during a recent discussion held in Parliament, the Spokesman said.
The government service needs 10,000 nurses more.
Only five (5) percent of male nurses could be recruited to the service now. The rest should be female nurses. Minister Senaratne would present a Cabinet paper soon to lift the limit, he said.
Health Ministry Secretary Janaka Sugathadasa, Health Services Director General Dr. Anil Jasingha, Health Ministry officials, parliamentarians and many others were present at the discussion, the Spokesman said.
