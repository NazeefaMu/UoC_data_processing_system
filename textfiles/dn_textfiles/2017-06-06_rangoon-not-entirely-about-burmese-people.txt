Rangoon is not entirely about the Burmese people

Director Rajkumar Periasamy's Rangoon, starring Gautham Karthik, is set to hit the screens next week. Talking about the film, the director says, "This film is the survival story of 24-year-old Venkat, whose family has been repatriated from Burma. The story is set against the backdrop of north Madras. The youngster, Venkat, faces a lot of challenges and how he comes out of it forms the crux of the film. The film is not entirely about the Burmese people in the city, the repatriots are just a part of the film. This will be a complete entertainer as well." On the title and about casting Gautham, he says, "The film has been titled Rangoon because that place plays a key role in the plot. As soon as I finished the script, Gautham came to mind considering his age, which will be apt for the role." The film has been extensively shot in and around the city. Says Rajkumar, "We were very clear from the beginning that we would never erect a set for the shoot. We wanted only live locations to give that realistic touch to the film."
Music has been composed by debutant Vikram and background score is by Vishal Chandrashekar. Talking about the songs, Rajkumar says, "Yaathriga is one of my favourite songs. Na Muthukumar had written this song based on the theme of Yaadhum Oore Yaavarum Kelir. This song has positive lines about how one has to approach the future. This is the title song of the film."
Ask him about going with two music directors, he says,"This culture is very popular in Bollywood and I wanted to try it out here. Moreover, both have their strengths and have done an equally great job."
