Altair continues with support to SLMDA, UK

Altair supported the Sri Lanka Medical and Dental Association’s Gala Charity Ball held at Carden Park, Chester, a destination resort in Cheshire, UK.
Altair’s continued support to the association is in recognition of the SLDMA’s unremitting efforts on alleviating the circumstances of medical students in Sri Lanka and supporting their educational experiences through enhancement of facilities, endowments and scholarships.
