‘EPF will not be invested in secondary bond market’

The Central Bank Governor has informed that the Employee’s Provident Fund is no more invested in the secondary bond market, the JVP North Central Provincial Council member Wasantha Samarasinghe yesterday said.
Samarasinghe, the Chairman of the Voice against Corruption (VAC), said he has been informed as such by Governor Dr. Coomaraswamy, as a reply to several inquiry letters sent to the Central Bank by his organization.
He was testifying before the Presidential Commission inquiring into the Treasury bond issue yesterday.
Samarasinghe pointed out the stoppage implies that there indeed has been a misuse of the EPF.
Samarasinghe said the VAC considers it as their responsibility to safe guard the Employee’s Provident Fund from being misused. He pointed out VAC has exposed losses incurred when the EPF was invested in the Stock Market in 2012 and the attempt to use the EPF money to establish a pension scheme in 2011.
Asked if he is able to provide detailed information on his allegation that the transactions happened on the 27 February 2015, Samarasinghe said he cannot since the Central Bank has not provided him with the necessary information.
Samarasinghe alleged that the Perpetual Treasuries (PVT) Limited (PTL) sold several of its bonds and bills in order to find money to buy the Rs. 10 billion worth treasury bonds issued on February 27, 2015. Samarasinghe alleged these transactions prior to the questioned bond issuance, implies that the bond scam was a well planned one.
Of the Rs.140 billion transactions done by the EPF in 2015 and after, in the secondary bond market transactions, 80 percent of them were done with the PTL, Samarasinghe said.
Legal counsel Chanaka de Silva and President’s Counsel Nihal Fernando objected when Samarasinghe produced a document which is allegedly an internal audit report prepared by the Central Bank. De Silva said the document is incomplete while Fernando PC said it is an illegal document came in to the public domain via an information leakage.
The Senior Additional Soliciter General Dappula de Livera requested the Commission to accept the document as they Attorney General’s panel is to lead evidence based on this report in due course.
A document prepared by a panel of eminent persons working for the VAC on the personal expenses of Former CBSL Governor Arjun Mahendran was produced before the Commission. It was disregarded since the details are irrelevant to the mandate of the Commission.
Samarasinghe is to testify before the Commission today as well.
Speaking to the media after the session for the day was over, Samarasinghe said he is unafraid of the cross examinations to be done by the legal counsels representing the former Governor and the PTL today.
