Sixty Lankan smokers die daily

Sixty Sri Lankans die daily due to smoking while annually 15,000 to 20,000 Sri Lankans die due to various health complications developed due to smoking, a Senior Lecturer in Health Promotion attached to the Rajarata University said.
Addressing a meeting held at the National Hospital of Sri Lanka in connection with Sri Lanka Laryngectomees Association yesterday, he said that annually six million people in the world die due to various health complications caused due to smoking.
This is a significant threat to the health of all people living in the world.
According to Dr. Fernando, cigarette smoke contains 30 cancerous substances while alcohol contains one cancerous substance. Aginomoto contains one cancerous substance.
Therefore, there is no other substance in the world as dangerous as cigarette smoke.
According to the Head of the ENT Unit of the Colombo National Hospital Dr. Chandra Jayasuriya, people who smoke, alcoholics, traders, bus conductors, school/tution class teachers, lawyers etc are at risk of developing Larynx cancer.
"Persons with Larynx cancers should undergo surgery in order to avoid further complications and to save lives. After surgery they can use an Electro Larynx or a Tracheo Oesophageal Speaking Valve to speak," she added.
