Israel to grant five-year visas for agriculture sector

Israeli has agreed to grant a five-year visa for Sri Lankan migrant workers in the agriculture sector.
Deputy Minister Manusha Nanayakkara who visited Israel on the instructions of Telecommunication, Digital Infrastructure, and Foreign Employment Minister Harin Fernando held bilateral discussions in this regard with the Israeli Foreign Ministry officials.
The agreement will be signed with the coordination of the International Migration Institute. Israeli officials said a considerable number of Sri Lankans out of the 500 employed in the agriculture sector in Israel have not returned upon expiry of their visas and this would cause the future job quota to be reduced. They said those who had returned upon expiry of their visas would be able to get jobs in the same sector again.
At this discussion, both parties agreed to sign agreements immediately on facilitating 500 Sri Lankans to obtain jobs in the housemaid sector in Israel.
Israeli officials were also positive about the request made by the Deputy Minister for expediting the issuance of visa for employees who have passed the interviews for employment in Israel.
Ambassador to Israel Periyasami Pillai Selvajar and Foreign Employment Bureau Deputy General Manager Mangala Randeniya also participated in the talks.
