Rubs shoulders with the biggest names in sport and showbiz : Roger Federer at the Met Gala 2017

The Met Gala is renowned for its unique themes and outlandish outfits.
For this year's edition of the fundraising event, the biggest names in sport and showbiz gathered in New York over the weekend to honour Commes de Garcons’ designer Rei Kawakubo.
And 18-time Grand Slam champion Roger Federer bought into the occasion, rubbing shoulders with Hollywood A-listers while wearing a Gucci tuxedo that featured an embroidered crystal king cobra emblazoned across his back.
Federer attended the Met Gala with his wife, Mirka, and admitted he had ‘never worn anything close’ to the Alessandro Michele-designed tuxedo.
‘(It's) business in the front, party in the back,’ he told GQ.
Federer is widely considered the greatest tennis player of all time. And while in New York he bumped into another sporting icon - five-time Super Bowl-winning quarterback, Tom Brady.
The 35-year-old also posed for photos with actress Salma Hayek. ‘I was so lucky to be seated next to RogerFederer last night at the met ball he is very nice and so funny when he is not playing tennis,’ she wrote on Instagram.
Federer enjoyed a remarkable start to 2017. The 35-year-old won his 18th major at the Australian Open in Melbourne in January before picking up ATP Tour 1000 victories at Indian Wells and Miami.
Fellow tennis star Serena Williams also attended the fundraising event in New York, having recently announced that she is expecting her first child at the age of 35.
