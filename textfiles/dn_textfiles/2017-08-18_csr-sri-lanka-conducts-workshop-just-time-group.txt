CSR Sri Lanka conducts   workshop for Just In Time Group

A team of members from CSR Sri Lanka conducted a workshop for the Just In Time Group (JIT) recently, to assess their current operations against systematic sustainability benchmarks.
Just In time Group (JIT) was the first corporate in Sri Lanka to use the internationally recognized diagnostic tool CSR 2.0; demonstrating their investment towards transformative CSR and to enter into the age of responsibility.
The aim of this assessment was to evaluate JIT’s current awareness to align business strategies towards achieving a long term value creation through systematic sustainability. JIT’s assessment covered a cross sectional team representing; PR and Communications, Legal, HR, Engineering, Secretarial, Marketing and Managerial – which led to a shared transparent view of the organization and therefore an effective assessment of the CSR stage that JIT required to strategize to enhance their way forward. 
The assessing team comprisedof CSR SL, Chairman - Chandula Abeywickrema, Director – Mahesh Wijewardena and Aitken Spence PLC’s Asst. General Manager, Sustainability - YasangiRanden, who are professionals in their respective fields who are passionate
Many companies globally tend to practice one of four types of CSR, depending on their level of maturity; namely - defensive CSR (compliance-driven, risk-based), charitable CSR (altruism-driven, philanthropy-based), promotional CSR (image-driven, PR-based), and strategic CSR (product driven, code-based). This theory identifies five principles of CSR 2.0 - creativity, scalability, responsiveness, glocality, circularity and four DNA elements of CSR 2.0 - value creation, good governance, societal contribution and environmental integrity.
JIT hopes to work towards their own goals to assist CSR SL’s objectiveto shape the fabric of sustainable development initiatives of the private sector by increasing awareness of the potential to create long term value through systematic CSR or transformative CSR.
“Transformative CSR is pivotal to making change happen at all levels be it societal, national, organizational and individual level. To keep with the pulse of our stakeholders, we at JIT are moving forward to embrace and transform with greater sustainability and accountability.
We are excited to be a part of CSR 2.0 and also as the first company in Sri Lanka to consult on this”, said JIT HR, Legal and Admin Head Sherene Goonetilleke.
“CSR 2.0 is a strategic engagement that drives corporates towards greater sustainability by identifying key stakeholders namely, shareholders, employees, customers and the environment and ensuring all of their transformation in the process of doing normal business of the company as a business strategy”, said CSR Sri Lanka Chairman Chandula Abeywickrema.
CSR Sri Lanka is being supported by the United States Agency for International Development and private sector companies to improve the quality of CSR programmes to achieve business sustainability and to ensure companies’ responsibility towards their stakeholders such as shareholders, customers, employees, society and the environment to bridge the gap between ad hoc CSR projects and creating sustainable value.
