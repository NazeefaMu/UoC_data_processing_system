Sanga rejects speculation on Presidential bid

Former Sri Lanka cricket captain Kumar Sangakkara rejecting all speculation of him contesting the Presidential Election in 2020 insisted that he does not harbour any ambitions for political office.
Sangakkara in a lengthy post in his Facebook account on Sunday said; “I would like to put to rest speculation and rumour once and for all, confirming that I do not harbour any ambitions for political office. I never have, and, with enormous certainty, I can say I never will.”
He made the above comment with reference to varying opinions and speculations on his imminent entry into politics as a possible candidate for the presidential election in 2020.
“While I have no political ambitions, I do hope that we Sri Lankans have the patience and foresight to not only vote the best-suited and most-qualified persons into public office, but also thereafter retain patience as positive social and economic change will not be achieved overnight. I also hope that we have the strength to continuously agitate and demand integrity, accountability, transparency and respect from our elected politicians, ensuring they fully appreciate and understand that they are entrusted with our will to be exercised with responsibility in a manner that benefits all in our society equally,” he commented.
Sangakkara went on to comment that politics and public service are serious responsibilities that should be served with accountability and integrity holding sacrosanct the public trust.
“I have the greatest respect for those public servants, whether elected or appointed, who are motivated by good and honourable intentions and are therefore steadfastly committed to the betterment of our country,” he noted.
“Post cricket, my plan is, first and foremost, to focus on my family after many years of sacrifice on their part while I was away playing cricket around the world. I am also looking forward to the challenge of developing a second post-playing career in an exciting new phase of my life. Finally, I wish to continue to work with existing charitable partners and friends striving to help various disadvantaged sections of our community. I am forever inspired by the selfless and passionate leaders and volunteers driving these charitable organisations forward and I will try my hardest to support their wonderful efforts in meaningful and useful ways,” he added.
