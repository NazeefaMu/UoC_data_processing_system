Price of pepper to be declared at Rs. 900 per kilogram

 
The Cabinet approved to declare a certified price of Rs. 900 per kilogram of pepper and to grant a maximum concession of Rs. 150 from the government until the market price reaches a level of Rs. 900 per kilogram.
These prices and concessions were proposed by the Cabinet Subcommittee appointed on August 9 to deduce a solution after studying the issues faced by pepper planters due to the recent fall of pepper price.
The Subcommittee chaired by Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera comprised of the Ministers of Primary Industries, Disaster Management, Development Strategies and International Trade, Industry and Commerce, and irrigation and Water Resources Management.
