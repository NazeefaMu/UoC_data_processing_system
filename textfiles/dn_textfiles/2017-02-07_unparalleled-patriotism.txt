UNPARALLELED PATRIOTISM

Continued from yesterday
The fighting reached its climax from June to August and it became quiet by October. The reinforcements arrived from Madras lifting the morale of the British soldiers. In addition they adapted another method of suppressing the rebellion by terrorizing the people and setting fire to crops, destroying houses and irrigation systems, depriving them of their livelihood.
Herbert White the British Government Agent at Badulla has minuted: “If thousands died in the battle they were all fearless and clever fighters. People have lost their houses and all their belongings. It is doubtful whether Uva has at least now recovered from the catastrophe.”
The true identity of the pretender was revealed. Although he was known as Doraisamy, he was none other than Wilbawe a disrobed Buddhist monk and was arrested. He then escaped and fled to Bintanne where he found a sanctuary among the Adhivasis.
In the meantime a serious misunderstanding arose between Keppetipola and Madugalle. Later they patched up their differences and then led the rebellion. Nevertheless the disunity among them affected the rank and file, which helped greatly to turn the course of events in favour of the British.
Governor Brownrigg on January 1, 1818 met the Kandyan chieftains at the Magul Maduwa, addressing them in a long speech which was interpreted by Abraham de Saram expressed his concern and disappointment said: “any inhabitant in Ceylon (Sri Lanka) should have been wicked and bad base enough to plunge his country into war in an attempt to place on the throne a member of the late Malabar king whose tyranny and oppression the British had rescued it.”
The Governor warned the chieftains saying that Great Britain would never relinquish a sovereignty acquired by the voluntary acts of the chieftains and people.
Declared the leader of a gang
He then read a Proclamation in which he stated, “Keppetipola with 18 other rebels, outlaws enemies of the Britannic Majesty’s Government.”
Continuing his speech the Governor said, “anyone who helped to seize the traitors could be assured of honours and promotion. “But” he also added, “I have the power without your assistance to put this rebellion down and I will put it down.”
The proclamation also stated that their lives accordingly forfeited and their property confiscated. Their lands it was announced would be distributed as rewards among those who continued to be loyal. Keppetipola alias Monaravila was declared the leader of a gang.
Inspite of the Governor’s warnings and actions, Earl of Bathurst, the Secretary of State in England, in June 18, wrote to the Governor, “nothing could justify the pertinacious prolongation of the conquest which assumed extremely doubtful.”
The fighting continued and it became more intensive. On February 18 Martial law was declared over the entire Kandyan provinces. By this time the Kandyan Provinces had put forth their own leaders.
In April a reward of 1,000 pagodas was offered for the head of Keppetipola and an equal sum of money was offered for the head of Pilimatalawa. The situation however became so serious when arrangements were made to withdraw British troops from their positions in the Kandyan provinces.
Molligoda Disava in charge of Hatara Korale remained loyal to the British throughout and it helped the British to communicate between Colombo and Kandy. The shortage of food and illness among the rebels became acute daily which made the rebels disillusioned about their struggle. Due to the prolonged struggle the rebels found it difficult to replenish their numbers who were sick.
Other than Molligoda and Ehelepola the other Chieftains remained neutral or were loyal to the British. However, Ehelepola who remained loyal to the British was taken into custody and was sent to Colombo but no charges were made against him. Later he was sent on exile to Mauritious by the British providing the necessary comforts of a prince, where he spent the last years of his life.
The Chieftains Mollogoda, Ekneligoda, Mahavalatanne and Muslims continued to support the British which eventually helped to quell the uprising. By August the fighting abated. All was quiet in October.
British troops
Madugalle on an earlier occasion on September 8, on the advice of Pilimatalawa expressed his willingness to hand over Kepetipola and Wilbawe and cooperate with Kapuwatte and Ehelepola. This suggestion of Madugalle was conveyed to the Agent in Sat Korale.
At the same time on October 28, the officer in charge Nikawella Camp Ensign Schulebraid received the information of a Bhikkhu hiding in a nearby jungle sent dome of his men to capture him.
On reaching the place the Bhikkhu was brought before the officer. It was then revealed the monk was Wariyapola Sri Sumangala who had the Sacred Tooth Relic concealed in a bundle of robes he was carrying with him. The recovery of the Relic from the rebels was regarded by the people as a sign of the destiny of the British to rule over the Kandyans.
Although Madugalle patched up the differences with the other rebel leaders, with the arrival of the reinforcement from India the British troops became fortified.
The news of the fleeing Keppetipola and Pilimatalawa heading for Anuradhapura came to be known to the British troops led by Lieutenant William O’Niell who followed them on their trails. They left in the early hours on October 4, 1818, reached Puliyankulama Village in the afternoon at 3.00 p.m. They finally arrived at Paravahagama and surrounded the Paravahagama Walauwa where Keppetipola, Pilimatalawa and others were staying.
It was a rainy day which made the journey difficult for the soldiers. When they surrounded the Walauwa, two rounds of firing were aimed at them. Then the guns became stilled. On the orders of O’Niell, the soldiers broke into the Walauwa when Keppetipola appeared from inside, held the hands of O’Niell and identified himself saying “I am Keppetipola.”
Details of Disava’s capture
Pilimatalawa was sick and was lying in bed while Madugalla succeeded in escaping through the rear of the Walauwa, with two other Mohottalas taking with them Keppetipola Disava’s sword and his dress he wore in battle and his ornaments, hurriedly fled to Monaravila Walauwa in Koswatta close to Matale.
The two Mohottalas and Madugalle reached the Walauwa at Monaravila. While conveying the details of the Disava’s capture his wife fainted. Madugalle who was standing close by held her preventing from falling. After regaining her senses, she spoke saying that she would go to Kandy and meet the British Agent and plead innocence of her husband.
Madugalle cautioned her not to do so and said it would create problems and futile to act in that manner.
Three days later after arresting Keppetipola, Madugalle too was arrested and they were brought to Kandy under army guard. The news of the arrest of Kepptipola and Madugalle by Lieutenant O’Niell made Governor Brownrigg happy and congratulated him, ordered extra allowance to the members of the British army who accompanied O’Niell. In a Gazette notification the Governor felicitated Lieutenant O’Niell, “on the capture of these superlative disturbers of public peace.”
On the same day of arrest November 13, they were tried under court martial “for waging war with intent to subvert His Majesty’s Government lawfully established.”
The court comprised Lieutenant Colonel R. Kelly, the President while H.W. Cleather was the Deputy Judge Advocate. The order of the court was given on the same day.
It said, “The court having maturely weighed and considered the evidence in support of prosecution and given due weight to such matters as have been waged by the prisoner in his defence is of opinion that the said Keppetipola late Disava of Ouva otherwise called Monaravila Maha Nilame was guilty of acts of treason. Wherewith he is charged viz. Keppetipola late Disava of Uva otherwise called Monaravila Maha Nilame, a proclaimed traitor charged with having at various places was against the Majesty’s Government by having in or about the month of May last at Diyabatme Welle and other places in Uva exercised the office of the First Adigar or Minister to a person pretending to be king of Kandy and by having in or about the month of July last entered the Province of the four Korales with a body of armed men for the purpose of instigating the people of that Province to rebellion with the view of subverting His Majesty’s Government lawfully established.”
Kandyan chieftains
The court having so found the prisoner guilty aforesaid doth adjudge him to suffer death at such a time and place and in such manner as His Excellency the Governor and Commander of the Forces may be pleased to direct.
While Keppetipola was in jail according to Henry Marshall, Deputy Director General of Army Hospitals, Keppetipola conducted himself with self expression. When Marshall visited him in jail, he spread out the coarse soiled cloth he was wearing round his waist, said smilingly, “you know this is not the way I used to dress.”
Marshall also said, that Keppetipola never hesitated to discuss the subject of the insurrection and his manners and conduct were frank and affable in the company of Europeans unlike other Kandyan chieftains.
Keppetipola and Madugalle were executed near Bogambara lake on November 26. They were first taken to the Sri Dalada Maligawa on that day early morning at their request where they met Sawers, whom Keppetipola knew at Badulla.
Marshall then described the last act of these two leaders. The knelt before the priest upon the threshold of the sanctuary, the repository where the Sacred Relic was placed.
Keppetipola gave a description of the meritorious acts which he did to the Sangha and gifts bestowed on temples and other acts of piety. He then pronounced his prarthana – the last wish he made was that in his next birth he might be born in the Himalayas and finally attain Nirvana.
Last religious offering
Thus concluded his religious devotions. He was then addressed by the Nayaka Thera who spoke in an impressive tone and manner acknowledged that his merits thus accrued were great and pronounced a benediction.
The last words of the monk were “as sure as a stone thrown up into the air returns to the earth so will you in consideration of your religious merits, be present at the next incarnation of the Buddha and receive your reward.”
The scene between the chief monk and Keppetipola was most solemn and impressive. Keppetipola who had been kneeling all this while rose up turning to Sawers, addressed him “I give you a share of the merits of my last religious offering.”
He then rewound his upper cloth from the waist and presented it to the Sri Dalada Maligawa, jocularly observing it said, although it was both foul and ragged the merit of the offering would not on these accounts be diminished it being all he had to give. Keppetipola in a firm and collected manner shook hands with Sawers and bade farewell.
Keppetipola sent his last message to his wife through a close associate and requested her to go with her son Podi Banda to live with her parents at Delwala Walauwa in Marapana close to Kegalle and to convert his residence at Keppetipola into a temple and with the income from the lands to maintain the temple. Afterwards he was conducted to the place of execution near Bogambara lake not far from Sri Dalada Maligawa. He then requested to be provided with water for ablutions and asked for a short time to perform his religious rites. His request was granted and he washed his hands and face, tied up his hair in a knot on the top of his head and sat down on the ground beside a small bush, grasping it at the same time with his toes and from the fold of his cloth which enclosed his loins he took a small Bana potha.
He began to recite some gathas from it, then handed it to the local official who was present and requested him to give it to Sawers as a token of gratitude he felt for his friendship and kindness shown while they were officially associated at Badulla.
While Keppetipola was repeating Pali gathas the executioner struck him on the back of his neck with a short sword. At the time he breathed out the words Araham. A second stroke deprived him of life as he fell on the ground – a corpse. His head then being separated from the body and according to the Kandyan custom it was placed on his chest.
Henry Marshall later presented the cranium of the departed Keppetipola Disava to the Museum of Phrenological Society of Edinburgh.
When Sri Lanka was granted independence the skull of the Disava was returned to the island. On November 26, 1954, the skull was interred in a memorial built at the Maha Maluwa facing the Pattiruppuwa of the Sri Dalada Maligawa. The memorial pillar is based on a platform of the architecture of the Anuradhapura period – the foundation of the Sinhalese culture.
The monument is a Kandyan pillar standing on a moulded base. The centre of the pillar has four panels adapted from the carvings of Embekke devale and on each of which is carved the figure of a Sinhalese soldier in the attitude of fighting. The capitol of the pillar is surmounted by a Vimana copied from Gadaladeniya vihara. The pillar symbolizes the brave chieftain who laid down his life for his country.
The panel relief portrays his act of bravery and the Vimana signifies that he has been exalted to the position of a higher spirit.
