Buddha statues used as props to raise vehicle

Two youths who had used two Buddha statues as props to raise the front tyres of their van to change a punctured back tyre of the vehicle at Eriyagama, Peradeniya on the Kandy road were arrested by Peradeniya Police for alleged sacrilege.
The arrest was made following information given by a resident of Eriyagama that they had removed two Buddha statues found beside a Bo tree in the area to be used as props for their van during the tyre change.
The two suspects, residents of Puttalam, were produced before Kandy Chief Magistrate Indika Prabath Attanayake and released on two sureties of Rs. 50,000 each.
