Golden Key Hospital acquires Zeiss AngioPlex OCT Angiography capability

The Golden Key Hospital has taken a major step forward in retinal disease management with the acquisition of new equipment that enhances the capability of its Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) facilities.
The Hospital said it has upgraded its CIRRUS 5000 HD-OCT machine with Zeiss AngioPlex OCT Angiography, enabling doctors to view both vascular and structural information from a single non-invasive scan.
As a result, they are able to acquire ultra-clear, colour-depth-resolved 3D microvascular imaging of the retina via dye-free angiography as part of routine eye care, making retinal disease management and treatment planning more efficient and effective.
“Angioplex technology revolutionises clinical practice with single-scan simplicity, and ensures artefact-free scans and precise location identification during follow-up visits,” a spokesman for the Golden Key Hospital said. “It also eliminates concerns about potential allergic reactions to the dyes used in standard angiography.”
The technology also enables doctors to quantify microvascular change in patients by comparing changes from visit to visit to identify patients progressing in disease.
The acquisition of this latest technology reflects the Hospital’s continuing commitment to offering patients the benefit of the best medical equipment available and standards that match those of renowned international medical institutions, he said.
The Golden Key Hospital is the only private sector hospital in Sri Lanka that is a centre of excellence dedicated and equipped for all Eye & ENT related investigations, treatment and surgery. This state-of-the-art super specialty hospital is backed by a team of experts and nursing staff with specialised training in Eye and ENT. The hospital is equipped for 3D Optical Coherence Tomography and treatment of all eye diseases. Tests such as Fundus Fluorescein Angiography (FFA), Fundus Photography, A&B scans, Visual field assessment, Pachymetry Binocular Single Vision test, computerised eye tests for spectacles, as well as laser treatment and phacoemulsification surgery for cataracts are done routinely at the hospital. The hospital also offers vitreoretinal surgery for problems such as retinal detachment, diabetic eye diseases and intraocular infection.
The hospital is managed by an Advisory Committee comprising of Professor Rohan W. Jayasekara, Emeritus Professor and former Dean of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Colombo (Chairman), Dr. Saliya Pathirana, Senior Consultant Eye Surgeon, Dr. Saumya Paranawithana, Consultant Eye Surgeon, Dr. Dilruwani Aryasingha, Consultant Eye Surgeon and Niranjan Silva, Chief Operating Officer.
