Death sentence for drug peddler

A man who was found guilty of possessing and peddling 51.88 grams of heroin in 2014 was yesterday sentenced to death by Colombo High Court.
While handing out a judgement against the accused, High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga observed that the prosecutors have proved the accused’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The accused, Sheikh Mohammed alias Master, a resident of Borella, had been arrested by Police Narcotics Bureau on July 3, 2014.
The Attorney General (AG) had indicted the accused under the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs (Amendment) Act No. 13 of 1984.
