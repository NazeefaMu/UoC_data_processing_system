Major proposals to be brought to upgrade hospitals in Eastern Province

Opposition Leader of Eastern Provincial Council M.S.Uthumalebbe is going to bring in three significant proposals at the 76th Council Meeting to be held on April 25 in Trincomalee.
In his proposals, he would request the Council to upgrade the Kinniya Hospital and bring it under the Central Government to rectify the shortcomings available in the hospital and improve the Infrastructure facilities.
Kinniya was severely affected by dengue recently due to lack of facilities needed for control it.
The Muthur hospital has to be upgraded to A category from B category as there are Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslims live together. They need a hospital with all the infrastructure facilities. Earlier a decision was taken at the previous Provincial Cabinet to upgrade the hospital.
The Ak/Arham Vidyalaya was affected by Tsunami in 2004, but a piece of land is required to develop the school. The Council has to allocate funds to purchase a land for the school’s development. The proposals on these issues will be brought at the meeting, Uthumalebbe said.
