Sweden’s Forsberg can hurt Germans in World Cup crunch match

SOCHI, Friday: An early German exit from the World Cup seems unthinkable, but that could be the grim reality for the reigning champions unless they get the better of Sweden this weekend. Still, at least they know exactly where the danger is coming from.
The main creative threat in Janne Andersson’s principally solid, unspectacular side lies in the shape of Emil Forsberg, one of the most talented wide attackers in Europe. “I’m a big fan of Emil Forsberg, he’s a great player,” said Germany defender Mats Hummels on Thursday when asked if anyone in the Scandinavians’ side could make it into the World Cup holders’ line-up. Bayern Munich defender Hummels and his international teammates are well placed to comment on Forsberg’s ability. The 26-year-old has come to Russia on the back of two outstanding seasons in the Bundesliga with RB Leipzig, and on Saturday evening, at the Fisht Stadium by the Black Sea, he will come up against a German side featuring his club colleague Timo Werner.
The Germans came early to Sochi to acclimatise to the heat as they look to stave off talk of a crisis following their 1-0 defeat to Mexico, with which they began their trophy defence.
In contrast, the Swedes -- who stunned Italy in a play-off to qualify -- travel down the coast from their peaceful base in the resort of Gelendzhik in rather more buoyant mood after beating South Korea 1-0.
If Mexico beat the Koreans earlier on Saturday, a draw for Sweden against the Germans would probably condemn Joachim Loew’s side to an early exit in Group F -- Sweden could then play against the Mexicans in their final game knowing a point would take them both through.
