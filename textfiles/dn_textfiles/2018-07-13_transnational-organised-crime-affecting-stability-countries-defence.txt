Transnational Organised Crime affecting stability of countries - Defence Secretary

Profits from Transnational Organised Crime (TOC) networks amount to 1.5% of the global GDP or 7% of the world’s exports of merchandise. Dire consequences of TOC are experienced by countries, while peace and stability of countries is affected by this, Defence Secretary Kapila Waidyaratne PC said.
It is estimated by the World Bank that around US$ 1 trillion is spent each year to bribe public officials causing economic distortion and damage to legitimate economic activity, Waidyaratne
making the keynote address at the seminar on Transitional Organised Crime in Sri Lanka organised by the BCIS yesterday.
He said the vast sums being bought can compromise the legitimate economies and have a direct impact on governance, such as corruption and even manipulation of elections.
“The irony of TOC is that the major illicit trade routes emanate from major economies, meaning the world’s biggest trading partners which are also the world’s biggest markets for illicit goods and services.This not only reflects the correlation between TOC and global trade, but also the lack of regulatory and legal mechanisms to address the issue adequately.
This illegal trade is also facilitated through established and legal institutions such as banking financial centres, shipping lines and other related trade and communication networks.”
He noted that the flexibility, adjustability and adaptability allows for the exploitation of the weak society segments to meet the selfish aims of the organised crimes syndicates. While the illicit trade grows, emanating from the developed countries, its effects are mostly penetrated to the developing and conflict ridden countries, due to its weak rule of law and state institutions.
“Ties between the TOC cartels, government institutions and the high end business represent a significant threat to economic growth and democratic institutions. Weak governance mechanisms pave the way for the corrupt bureaucrats who facilitate TOC.”
The Defence Secretary pointed out that alliances with political leaders, financial institutions, law enforcement, foreign intelligence and security agencies undermine free markets and economic stability.
Penetration of the TOC into governments aggravates corruption undermining the rule of law, judicial independence, free media, democratic institutions, transparency and accountability.
He said in order to combat TOCs it requires partnership at all levels such as governments, businesses, civil society, international organisation and people in all corners of the world have to play a part.
