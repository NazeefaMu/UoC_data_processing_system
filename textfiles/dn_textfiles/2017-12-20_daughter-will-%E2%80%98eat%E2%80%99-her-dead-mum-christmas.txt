Daughter will ‘eat’ her dead mum for Christmas

In another bizarre case of love gone horribly wrong, a grieving daughter has ensured she will be with her late mum on Christmas day, because she plans to scatter her ashes on the turkey.
Debra Parsons, 41, has been ‘eating’ her mum Doreen’s ashes since she died in May because she wants to feel ‘as close as possible’ to her deceased mother.
Now, it turns out that her cravings has got even stronger with Christmas and she plans to dust the turkey and Christmas pudding with her mum’s remains.
Speaking to Sunday Mirror she said that the ritual will be the only thing that would get her through her first Christmas with her beloved mum.
She went on to say, “People might think I’m mad or that it’s not a very respectful thing to do but I just can’t stop myself. I feel like she can live on by being inside of me because if she is part of me she can breathe through my body. My breath is her breath.”
It turns out that Doreen passed away suddenly from an airway obstruction after suffering a chest infection in May leaving Debra distraught.
She was given her share of the ashes two months later by her sisters, who are unaware of what Debra has been doing to them. While originally she kept them in a sandwich bag and carried her mum to bed and around the house, she suddenly developed the “urge” one day.
Debra said, “I opened the box and licked my fingers and just dipped them into the powder. Before I knew what I was doing they were in my mouth and the chalky, salty taste was comforting. I felt confused by what I had done to begin with but the feeling of comfort and closeness it brought was the first bit of solace I’d had since her death.”
But with Christmas just around the corner, Debra wants to move on from tasting her mum with her finger or “on a little spoon”.
Debra wants Doreen to be a “part of the celebration” and is even planning to prop up the Christmas lunch table with a photo of her mum as well.
