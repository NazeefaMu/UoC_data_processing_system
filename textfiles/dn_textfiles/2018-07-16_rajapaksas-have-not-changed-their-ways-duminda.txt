Rajapaksas have not changed their ways - Duminda

The Rajapaksa family rule was one reason why we opposed Mahinda Rajapaksa. The Rajapaksa’s have still not changed their ways, SLFP National Organiser and Minister Duminda Dissanayake said.
“Today they are bandying Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and Basil Rajapaksa as Presidential candidates”, he said. He was speaking at a meeting of the Medawachchiya electorate SLFP Central Organisation recently.
Dissanayake said even three and a half years after their defeat, the Rajapaksas did not talk about putting forward a Common Candidate other than a member of the Rajapaksa family.
Dissanayake said if a person like Dinesh Gunawardena or Vasudeva Nanayakkara was projected as the next Presidential candidate, they could easily reconsider their stand. But, the Rajapaksas were still talking about protecting their family interests.
“The SLFP and the country were not the private property of the Rajapaksa family,” Dissanayake said.
Dissanayake said personally, he had a high regard for Mahinda Rajapaksa as an individual. He had both good and bad qualities. But lately, his bad qualities had overtaken his good qualities.
“The New York Times newspaper had recently alleged that a Chinese Company had paid off millions to Mahinda Rajapaksa. If Mahinda Rajapaksa denies the allegation, he should take the New York Times to task without trying to resort to an eyewash by targeting Sri Lankan journalists who assisted the New York Times Journalist who published the report,” Minister Dissananayke said.
Dissanayake said the 16 member Group of Parliamentarians who left the government ranks had now got stranded because a majority of the Joint Opposition members had given them step-motherly treatment.
Although Mahinda Rajapaksa had done a media show by accompanying Gotabhaya Rajapaksa to Basil Rajapaksa’s SLPP office, all three of them were not legally entitled to contest the next Presidential election.
The meeting was organised by Medawachchiya SLFP Organiser and Director Special Projects President’s Office, Tissa Karaliyadda.
