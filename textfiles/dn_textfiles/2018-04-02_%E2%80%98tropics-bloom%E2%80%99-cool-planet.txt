‘Tropics in Bloom’ at Cool Planet

Cool Planet launched a new theme titled ‘Tropics in Bloom’ for the upcoming Sinhala and Tamil New Year season. Incorporating the concept of the summer season, the campaign is set to emphasize the spirit of warm blues and blooming flowers. The seasonal theme is bound to give shoppers the liberty to choose from this season’s collection that will define a fresher and brighter look.
“With the New Year season closing in, we look forward to offering to our loyal customers a new array of offers and discounts. Cool Planet continues to strive towards enhancing our products and create value for money. The new collection is bound to get you to experience a new wardrobe with fresh looks for all the fashionistas out there. We take this opportunity to wish all Sri Lankans a Happy New Year,’ Cool Planet CEO Rizwi Thah stated.
Blue is denoted as the prominent colour in this collection and has been intermingled with a neutral palette of beiges from shades of off-whites, cream and sand. Soft shades of pink have been combined with bright red for those who crave a little more oomph into their daily wear. Not forgetting the accessories side of things, shoppers will also be welcomed with a selection of comfortable footwear and a stylish handbag range.
To help complete a stylish look, gold and silver jewellery range has also been introduced for that touch of sophistication during the New Year celebrations. Cool Planet’s flagship outlet is located at Colombo 05, with other branches scattered across locations in Kandy, Malabe, Nugegoda, Pelawatta, Wattala and Maharagama.
