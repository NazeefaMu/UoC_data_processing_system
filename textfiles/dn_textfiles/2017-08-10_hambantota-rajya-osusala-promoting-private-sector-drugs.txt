Hambantota Rajya Osusala promoting private sector drugs

The Hambantota Rajya Osusala is promoting drugs imported by private drug importers although the motive of the Rajya Osusala is to promote drugs imported or manufactured by the State Pharmaceutical Corporation, the people of the area said. When a prescription is produced to a pharmacist at the Osusala, the pharmacist first quotes the prices of the private sector drugs instead of quoting the prices of the drugs imported by the State Pharmaceutical Corporation. 
The corporation set up the Osusalas to provide drugs and medicines to patients at reasonable rates to prevent pharmacy owners from fleecing the patients.
