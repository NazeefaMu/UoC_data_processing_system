My favourite songs are the most personal ones

Singer Harry Styles said his most personal songs are his favourite ones. Reportedly, the 23-year-old musician, however, said that it might not necessarily be the case as one should feel "great" while listening to whatever song they listen.
"I think my favourite songs (are the most personal ones) but my favourite way to listen to music is on my own, with my eyes closed for example, or not. If I'm driving, or operating machinery, I usually keep them open."
"But my favourite song on the album, the last song, 'From the Dining Table,' is the most personal to me and I think my favourite one. But I don't think they have to be.I think it's just as important to have songs that are fun and make you feel great, and I think that's just as important as everything being moody and deep and meaningful," Styles said ahead of his performance at Los Angeles' Grammy Museum.
