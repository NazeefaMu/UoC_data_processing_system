Horizon Campus pioneers genetic education in SL

With the growing role of genomics in healthcare, for patient diagnoses, treatment and disease prevention and as genetic-based technology develops, many opportunities have arisen in the food and beverage industry, health, biotechnology and research, bio-pharma and agri-industries
Positioning to be the leader in science education in the country: To investigate and delve further into the exploration of this cutting-edge field, and with their focus on offering the best science education in the country, Horizon Campus has currently made huge investments in new, spacious and modern teaching laboratories which provide excellent facilities for practical’s and small group project work, alongside state-of-the-art computing facilities.
Genetics is slated to be the next trillion dollar industry. A spokesperson at Horizon Campus stated “Genetics has undergone a rapid expansion that will have a decisive effect on health and society. Its range of applications is constantly widening and the biotechnology industry based on genetics shows great promise. In the future, doctors and scientists will use our genetic information to diagnose, treat, prevent and cure many illnesses. Commercialization of genomics is also going to change the lives of the vast majority of people. Today, health care is delivered with a very small degree of customization but that is going to change as genetic screening becomes less expensive and we better understand what to look for. The last trillion-dollar industry was built on computer code. The next will be built on genetic code.”
“With massive innovation in DNA sequencing technologies revolutionizing our knowledge and understanding of living systems, makes it a particularly exciting time to be studying this subject.
It is also important to prepare health professionals trained in genetics with skills and knowledge to manage the impact genetic and genomic technologies will have in future and to ensure that Sri Lanka is not left lagging behind in this arena.”
Nilai as the selected partner university, plays a vital role in offering their expertise through a practically oriented curriculum with extensive insights into the subject that has a high industry acceptance internationally. This in turn enables students to gain an added edge to their portfolio of experiences and expand their global perspectives on the subject. Registrations for the Diploma and Bachelors of Sciences (Hons) in Biotechnology are now open
