Scan Products commends ‘Achievers of The Year’ recipients

The Scan Products Division, which comprises of the FMCG arm under C. W. Mackie PLC, held its Annual Sales Conference recently, at the Club Palm Bay Hotel, Marawila.
The primary objectives of the event were to provide the participating staff members with a training session, partake in the award ceremony and felicitate the awardees as well as plan out the company’s strategy for the forthcoming financial year.
The most anticipated events agenda was the award ceremony where Scan Products outlined the very best of their field sales professionals, highlighting their hard work and achievements, and duly honouring them with star awards. Many field sales force members were recognised at the award ceremony for having exceeded their target limitations and going out of their way to achieve their work objectives. The winners, Ashan Thilakaratne Gold Award, Charitha Jayaweera the Silver Award and Chamal Karunaratne the Bronze Award. The winners were undoubtedly able to set themselves forward as exemplary figures amongst their peers as well as other staff members to follow suit. The theme of this year’s Annual Sales Conference was announced as ‘Growth With Focus’ and clearly set forth a straightforward vision for everyone involved.
Commenting on the event’s purpose and objectives, C. W. Mackie PLC, Executive Director, Mangala Perera said, “As this year’s Annual Sales Conference concluded successfully, I would like to recall more or less, five years ago when the Scan Products Division functioned as a small business unit within the C. W. Mackie PLC Group.”
