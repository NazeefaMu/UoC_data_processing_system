St. Claire’s Falls

Due to heavy rains in the Catchment areas and on the left slope of the Central Hills, the spill gates of the Upper Kothmale, Lakshapana and Canyon Reservoirs were opened. Water levels of the Castlereagh and Maussakelle Reservoirs are nearing spill level. A breathtaking view of St. Claire’s Falls following heavy rains. Picture by Asela Kuruluwansa
