Lazard, MTI investment banking delegation in town

Lazard, the US$ 2.7 billion global financial advisory firm in conjunction with Sri Lanka’s leading strategy Consultancy MTI, plans to meet officials of the Sri Lankan Government and discuss how Lazard could work with the Government in its attempt to divest and attract foreign investments for its large non-strategic assets like hotels. Lazard advises on many of the largest and most complex transactions, including advising Starwood Hotels on its sale to Marriott and Hotel Investment Partners on its sale to Blackstone.
