Youth complains of wrongful accusation

A youth resident in Nochchiyagama has made a complaint to the Sri Lanka Human Rights Commission against a former ASP, two CID officers and Ambanpola Police alleging that they have put him into great inconvenience by wrongfully implicating him in three robbery cases and an extortion case based on a murder he had not committed and sending him to remand prison for over three months.
The complainant, Merenna Johannesge Sanjeewa Dulip Kumara, 39, of Ihala Sinharagama, Nochchiyagama, has cited SP H. Samudrajeewa (former Anuradhapura ASP), CID Inspector Rajakaruna, Sergeant Mendis and Ambanpola Police as respondents.
He said he was handed over to Anuradhapura Police by Tirappana Police when he went to give evidence in the murder of STF member, SS Banda, and two other assistants at Selesthimadura, Tirappane on April 30, 2016.
Thereafter, he was wrongfully implicated in a gold jewellery robbery and extortion case involving Rs. 15 million and a robbery at the Mahawa Devalaya.
He alleged that he had been subjected to extensive torture at the hands of the police during his arrest.
