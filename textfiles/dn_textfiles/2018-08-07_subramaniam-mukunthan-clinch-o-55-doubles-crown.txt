Top seed India's Murthati Suresh won the Over 55 men's singles title beating Lankan ace Suresh Subramaniam 4/6, 6/1, 4/1 Ret in the final as the Sri Lanka Open ITF Senior Tennis Championship concluded at the Sri Lanka Tennis Association clay courts yesterday.
Subramanium bounced back strongly and won the second set after losing the first set to Murthati, but was unable to maintain consistency and conceded the victory retiring in the third set.
