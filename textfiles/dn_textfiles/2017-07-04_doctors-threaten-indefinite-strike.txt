Doctors threaten indefinite strike

The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) is to launch an indefinite strike at all hospitals island-wide beginning from July 5.
Addressing the media at the Officers’ of Professional Association (OPA) yesterday, GMOA Spokesperson Dr. Navin De Soysa said they object to the statement issued to the media by former Secretary to the President P.B. Abeykoon, regarding the decisions made during the discussion between the GMOA and the President.
The GMOA Spokesperson claimed that the press releas issued by the Secretary to the President contradicts with the decisions made by President Maithripala Sirisena at the meeting with the GMOA.
“President Sirisena made favourable decisions regarding SAITM but Health Minister Rajitha Senarathne messed it up. We had an official and open discussion with the President,”Dr.De Soysa said. Dr.Soysa further said that the Secretary to the President was not present at the meeting and added that an indefinite strike is on the cards if the government does not provide a positive response to their demands.
“We will continue to protest against SAITM until our demands are met by the government but it is the politicians that support SAITM who often come up with their own solutions,”he said.
Dr.Samantha Ananda said that the SAITM issue has become a national issue now and stressed that immediate measures need to be taken whilst ensuring that no injustice is done to the other medical students.
He said that a meeting with district level organisations will be held to create awareness among people and added that the way in which the GMOA intends to launch the strike would be informed in 24 hours.
