Minister to address forum

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne had received an invitation to address the forum on `Reaching the Last Mile: Mobilizing Together to Eliminate Infectious Diseases,’ to be held at the Abu Dhabi Global Market on November 15, a Health Ministry spokesman said.
According to the spokesman, <U+200B>Minister Dr. Senaratne and <U+200B>his delegation will leave for Abu Dhabi today. <U+200B>The forum will be attended by over 200 global health leaders focused on accelerating the elimination of deadly infectious diseases, such as polio and malaria, and preventable NTDs, such as Guinea-Worm Disease and River Blindness. Minister Senaratne will meet Bill Gates at the forum.
