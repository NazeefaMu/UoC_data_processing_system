Distortion, thy name is creativity

 
Theatre in any country demands an audience. No audience for theatre, or any other art form, indicates a cultural poverty of some sort. Parakrama Niriella, a veteran in local theatre, foresaw this poverty and founded Janakaraliya as a remedy.
Janakaraliya (People’s Theatre) was formed with a mission to develop a culturally and spiritually awakened society. Structurally a mobile cultural organisation, Janakaraliya uses a collapsible theatre and travels through districts with its theatre group.
It journeys from district to district with a host of activities: organizing drama, theatre training for youth, providing cultural and spiritual experiences and offering the people an opportunity to participate in cultural activities. The Janakaraliya team comprises Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim youth hailing from different parts of the country.
Q: Your pet project is Janakaraliya. Why have you initiated such a project?
A: A few decades ago, our artistes worked together without any issue of their ethnicity. That is before the war erupted. With a war going on, artistes were no longer united. We wanted to unite them under one umbrella. Janakaraliya is the result.
The project is also involved with programmes such as mobile theatre and theatre groups. When we work together as one group of people, it will be always for the betterment of the people. Ethnic harmony is a necessity for the art.
We have also launched programmes to introduce theatre for schools.
Q: Drama and Theatre is already a school subject. Isn’t it?
A: Drama and Theatre is confined to a theoretical subject at the school. How many people are following arts as a subject? But how many of them actually get into painting as a profession? Same goes for drama and theatre. It has become only a subject. You can study it well, pass the exam and then complete forget it. Students hardly pursue theatre as a professional subject.

Our school syllabi do not move a step ahead from Ediriweera Sarachchandra. We have not started serious studies of his successors.
Q: Drama and Theatre is not a lucrative profession as yet. Probably why.
A: Any aesthetic subject should have a market. A market has to be created. Art, as a whole, is a necessity of life. Just like you go to a doctor for medical treatment, and an engineer for a building construction, an artist should also offer you a service.
We have 24 hours a day. We work for eight hours. And we have the rest of the time for entertainment. Recently my daughter wanted to take our granddaughter somewhere on a night-out. We were looking for a place, and could not come across any sufficient place. You cannot go to Diyatha Park everyday. There is hardly any theatre hall. There is hardly any place to listen to a good music concert. You cannot find good museums. You cannot find good libraries. But there were more than enough eateries. When we have time for entertainment, what we do is eating and hardly anything else.
Q: All the same, Colombo’s walls are full of posters of upcoming stage plays. Doesn’t that mean that we have a good number of theatrical productions?
A: I did not mean to say that we are short of stage plays. We have talented young dramatists. But they are not being maintained. Doctors and engineers are looked after by the government. They can operate independently. Even politicians somehow manage to have an independent life at least for five years. But the artistes have no such guarantee.
Giving them a house or another perk or two is not what a government should necessarily do. The Government should allocate a separate budget to sustain artistes. India, for instance, has allocated a certain percentage of their GDP for the artistes. At the same time, stage plays such as Phantom of the Opera and Lion King have been shown for years. Like doctors, engineers and any other government employee, the artists should also be ‘maintained’ by the government.
The local theatre has about 15,000 spectators. They are the ones who come to theatre throughout the year.
Q: You mentioned that we have not moved ahead from Dr Sarachchandra. However William Shakespeare, a 400-year old playwright, is still celebrated in the west. Why?
A: What I mean is that we should not become a slave of Sarachchandra. Shakespeare is interpreted from many angles. Some study his language. Some study his theatre. And they move on from what he has originally written. Hamlet, for instance, has come out with quite a lot of productions. I watched a new version of Merchant of Venice. There the scriptwriter has moulded Shylock into a sympathetic character. Without damaging the text, they have tried to justify why Shylock came to be what he is. Akira Kurasova deconstructed Shakespeare’s Macbeth in ‘Throne of Blood’. He made use of noh tradition.
Q: Would not that be distortion?
A: Distortion is a requirement to sustain arts. Most great playwrights distorted ancient texts. In a distorted play, you should be able to see the original as well as the innovated plot.
Q: Buddhist elements seem to have seeped into arts as a recent trend. What’s your view?
A: That is largely because of the rekindled racism. The problem with these Buddhist films is that you cannot see much creativity. For example if Prince Siddhartha performs fighting shows, we do not like to see him bleeding. We will get rid of such scenes. And we include all the other miraculous events like walking in the air.
Q: Would not that fall under fantasy category?
A: They can fall under fantasy category. But then such films are meant for children and the hare-brained. Adults have nothing to gain from such films. At the same time, there are films which make use of the magic realism concept. Even if fantasy or magic realism elements are shown, you should be able to link them with the reality.
Take a film about a cruel emperor, and you make use of unrealistic scenes to show his cruelty. We know the scenes are unrealistic. We also know that such scenes are meant to enhance the cruelty of the emperor.
