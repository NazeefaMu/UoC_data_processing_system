HEALTHY LUNCH BOX

What to put for healthy school lunches
Try planning a healthy lunch box. Talk to your children and discuss what they would be happy to take to school.
The six key parts to a healthy lunchbox
include:
*Fresh fruit
*Fresh crunchy vegetables
*Milk, yoghurt or cheese. For children who cannot tolerate milk products, offer appropriate alternatives like calcium fortified soy or rice drink or soy yoghurt
*A meat or meat alternative food like some lean meat (e.g. chicken strips), hard-boiled egg or peanut butter.
*A grain or cereal food like bread, a roll, flat bread, fruit bread or crackers (wholegrain or whole meal choices are best)
*Water
 
Tips for healthy lunchboxes include:
 
Cut up large pieces of fruit and put them in a container – this makes it easier to eat, especially if your child has wobbly teeth or if they have less time to eat than they are used to.
Consider giving half a sandwich or roll for morning recess, as this is an easy way to get a healthy fill.
In the hot weather, send frozen milk, yoghurt or water, or even frozen orange segments. This makes a great refreshing snack and helps to keep the lunch box cool.
Go for colour and crunch in the lunch box by offering a variety of colourful vegetables and fruit.
 
What not to put in healthier school lunches
 
Some items do not belong in a healthy school lunchbox. Six items to avoid when preparing lunch for your children include:
All sweet drinks such as fruit juices, fruit drinks, cordials, energy drinks, flavoured waters, flavoured mineral waters, iced teas and soft drinks. These are high in energy (kilojoules) and sugar, and can lead to weight gain and oral health problems in children
Dried fruit bars and ‘straps’. These are low in fibre and are also high in sugar and can stick to children’s teeth, causing tooth decay
’Dairy desserts’, chocolate bars and muesli bars. These are generally high in fat and sugar
Chocolate spreads, jams and honey in sandwiches. These add extra, unnecessary sugar to the lunchbox
Fatty, salty processed meats ‘oven-baked’ savoury biscuits. These may sound like healthier options, but some are just as high in salt and fat as crisps.
 
Artificially sweetened drinks
Artificially sweetened drinks do not add extra kilojoules (energy) or sugar to the lunchbox, but still encourage sweet preference and promote the habit of drinking sweet drinks in children. Artificially sweetened soft drinks are also acidic and can lead to tooth decay. Artificially sweetened drinks should not be included in the lunchbox.
