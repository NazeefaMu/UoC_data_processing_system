Don’t break elections laws, Mangala tells UNP candidates

“This LG election is held by a government which pledged to uphold good governance, so I request you to campaign without breaking election laws,” Finance and Media Minister and Matara District United National Party (UNP) Organiser Mangala Samaraweera said.
He was addressing the UNP nominees and party organisers after launching the UNP campaign for the forthcoming LG polls.
“Even Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe volunteered to appear before the Presidential Commission investigating the Central Bank Bond issue because his name was mentioned many a time during the course of the investigation. No preferential treatment was shown to President Maithripala Sirisena’s brother when the vehicle he was driving met with an accident and was held in remand custody for 14 days. Therefore, you have to adhere to the election laws when you commence your campaign today,” the Minister said.
“You do not need to spend extravagantly on propaganda material for the election as you have ample time to visit every household within your ward. You have to canvass for the party as you do not have to fight each other for preferential votes. Make sure you canvass within the boundaries of your ward.
In 1989 when I first contested, my supporters who were not aware of the Matara District boundaries had even pasted my posters and put up cut outs even in the Hambanthota district,” Minister Samaraweera said.
He said the government had pledged to develop the country within its tenure and as the Finance Minister he was in a position to allocate a bit more to the Matara District with the consent of the Prime Minister and the President.
“At such a time, it would do good if you have a majority in all the local government bodies in the District.” he said.
UNP nominees for the forthcoming LG elections and party organisers including Minister Samaraweera partook milk rice on the dawn of the New Year before launching the UNP election campaign.
The campaign launch was held at the Buddhist College Auditorium, Matara.
