Lanka Cavaliers win Tyrone de Silva Challenge trophy

John Keells veteran cricketer, Ravi Subasinghe with an intelligent spell of bowling (4-17-4) helped the Lanka Cavaliers to regain the ‘Tyrone de Silva’ Challenge trophy after 06 years, in the 14th Annual Cricket Encounter 2017 Vs. MCA Committee at the MCA Grounds last Saturday.
MCA won the toss and decided to bat first on their home wicket (green) and a heavy out field.
They lost their openers, P.K. Abeygunasekera (02) and Mahesh de Alwis (08) at 11 and 21 falling to Peterite paceman, Riaz Farouk (3-20- 2).
MCA encountered more problems when their Academy head coach, Namal Seneviratne (12) got run out off a direct hit from Niranjan Dabare (28 for 3). Mahesh Wijewardene (18) and Duminda Pinto (43 in 35 balls with 03 sixes and 04
fours) held the fort for some time but when Ravi Subasinghe went into action all was over for MCA, soon all out for 102 in 17 overs.
Lanka Cavalier led by Basil Jayawardena for the first time, shed little sweat on reaching their target in 14.1 overs losing 02 wickets with Varuna Waragoda (30), Basil Jayawardena himself (32) and new recruit, Sanjaya Attanayake (25 not out), being very comfortable with the MCA bowlers. The 04 special awards went to Ravi Subasinghe from Lanka Cavaliers (Best Bowler and Man of the Match), Niranjan Dabare from Lanka Cavaliers (Best Fielder) and Duminda Pinto from MCA (Best Batsman).
Former MCA President Tyrone de Silva, who inaugurated the series during his tenure by donating the trophy in 2004 was the chief guest and gave away the challenge trophy. the other presenters were, Niran Mahawatte (President /MCA), Roshan Iddamalgoda (Snr. VP/MCA) and former President/MCA Chris Obeysekere.
