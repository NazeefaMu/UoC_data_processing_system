Mahindananda’s transfer application fixed for judgment

A Transfer Application filed by former Sports Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage seeking an order transferring a case filed against him to any other court of competent jurisdiction other than the Colombo High Court presided over by High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga was yesterday fixed for judgment by Court of Appeal.
Accordingly, the transfer application was fixed for judgment on June 20 by Justice Kumuduni Wickremesinghe and Justice S. Thurairajah.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against Aluthgamage for allegedly purchasing a house worth Rs.27 million at Kynsey Road, Colombo 7 over a complaint that he had allegedly purchased properties through illegally acquired money. In his petition, Aluthgamage stated that High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga was a member of the Presidential Commission (PRECIFAC) which initiated an inquiry against members of the former regime and further said he would deny a fair trial.
President’s Counsel Faizer Mustapha with counsel Keerthi Tillekaratne instructed by Sanath Wijewardena appeared for Mahindananda Aluthgamage. Senior State Counsel Janaka Bandara appeared for the Attorney General.
