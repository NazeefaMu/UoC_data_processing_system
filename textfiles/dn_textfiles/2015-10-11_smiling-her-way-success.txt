Smiling her way to success!

The world is her oyster. Bagging the title of Derana Goya Miss Sri Lanka 2015 was no mean feat but Visna Fernando managed to achieve her dream. The radiant beauty has been in the field for some time gathering experience as a model before making her big splash at the pageant. The 24 year old certainly took the glamour scene by storm as she catwalked her way to success. Visna will compete at the Miss Earth 2015 pageant that will be held in Vienna in December.
