Parking gets  easier with Tenaga  ParkSmart App

As the population of Colombo increases daily, the congestion on the roads is on a rise. With this, there is a lingering need for an effective vehicle parking management system. Tenaga Car Parks, the pioneer in providing parking and traffic management solutions in Sri Lanka presents to you the ultimate solution with the launch of their new user friendly and convenient mobile app Tenaga ParkSmart.
The mobile application was launched in partnership with the Colombo Municipal Council todayin the presence of Eng.L R L Wickramaratne Deputy Municipal Commissioner (Engineering Services) amongst other distinguished guests from the Colombo Municipal Council and the Sri Lanka Police.
Headed by Nihal Wickramaratne, Director Engineering Traffic Design and Road Safety and his team at the Colombo Municipal Council, ParkSmart is the first ever mobile application in Sri Lanka designed to facilitate efficient parking.
The designated areas where the Smart Park Machines have been placed are Galle Road (from Dehiwala to Galadari junction, including all connecting by-lanes) and R A De Mel Mawatha (from Dharmarama Road to Liberty Plaza Junction and all connecting by-lanes).
At the event, the CEO of Tenaga Car Parks (Pvt) Ltd, Dilan Perera enlightened those present about the Tenaga ParkSmart application. The solar powered parking machinespartnered with Dialog Axiata and powered by CALE Sweden have been in place at these locations from the beginning of last year. The parking tariff is calculated on an hourly basis and differs according to the vehicle type.
The mobile application developed by Negete (Pvt) Ltd, only available for Android devices at the time of the launch, will come into play as a tool to consume time and avoid the unnecessary hustle of personally going to the metre machines. This app provides the facility for payments to be paid using eZ cash, Dialog Add2Bill (in the near future) or through your debit or credit card. It comes with special features to make life much easier by having an automatic reminder that will notify you when your parking time is about to expire, a parking tracker and a record of all your parking history.
Representatives from Negete demonstrated to the gathering exactly how the app would function. Once downloaded, the application requires you to register your phone number as this is how the phone would be connected to the app.
Tenaga Park Smart will soon be available on other operating systems and is also expected to be joined by Gtechna, Canada to establish a proper system of enforcement.
