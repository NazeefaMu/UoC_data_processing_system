Books donated by Lake House were distributed through the Lion’s Club of Piliyandala among 20 schools in the Dompe Division. MP Harshana Rajakaruna was the Chief Guest.
Lake House through the Lions Club of Piliyandala emphasized on the importance of changing our education to suit the modern world of computers and the English language taking an important place and that steps will be taken to open computer and English education to every school as far as possible.
Speaking on the occasion, Rajakaruna said the book donation is a good step in that direction and thanked the Piliyandala Lions Club and the Chairman of Lake House, Kavan Ratnayake and its Director Board for the good act. He said after the present government came to power, remedial measures were being taken to attend to shortcomings in several schools in the Dompe Division and will provide buildings to schools most in need of it. He noted that there was a substantial progress in examination results in the division lately and the students show greater eagerness in their studies which is fulfilling our hopes.
