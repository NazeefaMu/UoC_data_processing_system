Greeks out of the shelves

Ideas, thoughts and creative visions born out of two main cultures could be named as Indian and Greek. Our teachers and their teachers often go back to these cultures in order to bring back the required and essential foundations of knowledge from these two cultures. As such, the number of books and the interpretations they carry is countless. The statement that goes as the most modern visions are found in most ancient cultures could be cited as a profound eternal ideology. I found the validity of this statement while reading the pages of the newest research contribution of Professor Kamani Jayasekara, titled as ‘Ideas on Literary Criticism of the Ancient Greeks’.
Professor Jayasekara paves the way to grasp the essence of Greek ideas on literary criticism taking into account the Greek creative writers as well as philosophers. The creative writers are basically the forerunners of the theatrical arts such as Aristophanes, Euripides, Sophocles, and Aeschylus. The philosophers include the great Greek thinkers like Socrates, Plato and Aristotle.
Ancient creators
The reader is made to know about their various creations, as well as the social thinking process, enabling how they helped mould a better living condition. How very beneficial and how very resourceful the ancient creators and philosophers in the propagation of their ideas and thoughts for those of us who live today. Have they not undergone changes in keeping with the contemporary innovative discoveries and ideological trends?
Jayasekara writes: The criteria for evaluating literature has been of controversial throughout the years ever since it was first established and became a popular necessity. The numerous ideas pertaining to evaluation has been subject to change before the actual ideas took their form as criteria. The criteria mainly depended on the changing values of the social context they were existing.
The introductory chapter titled as ‘Introduction to ancient literary Criticism’ embrace an account of a series of eye-opening sequence that triggers off classics said to have been created by the Greek poet Homer, who created Iliad and Odyssey.
Proceeding from this point, the researcher leads the reader such celebrities as Sappho, Theognis, Simonides, Thespis, Thales, Heraclitus and Xenophanes. Followed by notes enter the discussion on such creatures as Aristophanes taking into account most all the theatrical works like ‘The Archanians’, ‘The Wasps’, ‘Clouds’, ‘Frogs’, ‘Lysistrata’ and ‘Peace’.
Appropriately discussed
Followed by the interpretation on the most known Greek dramatists, an interpretation to their creative procedure are interspersed via the political social and cultural interpretation mainly on the visions as laid down by the philosophies of Plato and Aristotle. I sincerely felt that the need of the time is to see some of these literary of philosophical speculation should be written in Sinhala and Tamil in order to help build a better climate of opinion.
The concepts on comedy, tragedy and new comedy are discussed with examples from each area. At the same time, the evolution of the terms such as catharsis, imitation, the theory of mimesis, ethics and ethical interpretation, rhetorics, poetics are briefly yet appropriately discussed. These may help a student at the higher level of education to consider the cross-cultural conditions of the usages both in the Orient and in the Occident. Even though the term ‘modern’ and ‘modernity’ are not used by the researcher, this text deals with them in an indirect manner. These notes ought to be passed down in the form of a discourse taking the each ancient Greek personality chronologically. The printed publication is based on her PhD thesis.
As we were tutored by some of the veteran English teachers of literature, one of the main sources of creative spirit was derived from Greek legend and mythology. All of the great translators of Greek poetry myth and legend happen to be Robert Graves. According to Graves, myths and legends of Greek origin happen to seep into even to English and French poetry and drama. One predominant example is Prometheus legend.
Learned reader
Theories of Catharsis as founded by Aristotle in relation to rhetoric, ethics and politics is exemplified further into several categories by Jayasekara. They include segments such as ‘behaviorual view’, ‘emotional and psychological view, medicinal interpretations and ethical interpretations. This enables a learned reader to compare the theories of catharsis not merely limiting the meaning embedded in one sector, but to a multi-dimensional creative vision.
Professor Ediriweera Sarachchandra once told me that even the great oriental theatre theorist Bharatamuni too had laid emphasis on the term catharsis denoting the same as Vishodana or Vishranti when he said ‘vishranti jananam natyam. The term Vishranti is equivalent to the term catharsis as it carries the meanings of all manners of purification.
The concept of getting rid of pity and fear embraces the achievement of purification or the ultimate cleaning. In the manner, the text of Jayasekara helps the discerned reader to enter areas that are latent from the upper layers of verbal meanings. All in all the publication Jayaseakra leads not only to understand the ideas on literary criticism of the ancient Greeks but also to trace beyond those limits as an extension of insights on comparative literary and communication studies.
This commendable effort emphasises the vital role played by the ancient Greek playwrights and philosophers in order to mould a better spate of living. We who read these materials could gain enormous insights into our own living conditions.
