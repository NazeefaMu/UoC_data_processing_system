Meet Music Makers on World Music Day

On June 21 from 5pm until late, ON14 Rooftop Bar & Lounge at OZO Colombo will host Sri Lanka’s biggest music celebration for world music day, where 19 DJs from back in the day to the up-and-coming will jam some tunes together, spreading nothing but good vibes through their music.
Since 1982, June 21 has been celebrated across many countries as World Music Day, featuring amateur and professional musicians performing on the streets, in squares and public places. With the theme Make Music, large bands usually throw free gigs and invite cross-genre musicians to share the stage with them as they celebrate the day.
“At ON14, local partygoers will get a chance for the first time to get connected with a large number of popular DJs. Setting the groove for all music lovers, the event will feature Yazz, Van Luup, Ricky, Alexxo, Nigel, Dimuth K, Dex T, Sajeewa, Stefan, Nick, Sid, Daniel, Ashane, Adithya, Minol Dee, Dhanushka and many more celebrated local DJs including myself”, Events & Music Area Manager Timothy Claessen said in a press release.
Come, enjoy and meet some likeminded people on a cool Tuesday evening.
Indulge in a one-on-one Happy Hour from 5pm to 7pm and watch the sunset as the DJs continue spinning retro classic tunes from the 70s, funk jazz, dance tunes from the 90s, old-school RnB, Nu Jazz, lounge music, deep house and Nu Disco, which are sure to create an interesting mix.
