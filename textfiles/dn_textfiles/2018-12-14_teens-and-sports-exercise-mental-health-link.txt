Teens and Sports: The Exercise-Mental Health Link

Teen sports can have a major impact on quality of life. Physical activity has significant benefits for teen mental health. Therefore, each teen needs to find a way to reap those benefits. For some kids, dance, yoga, and hiking are good options. In addition, for many teens, high school sports are an accessible and enjoyable way to get moving. Teen basketball, teen baseball, intramural sports, and youth track clubs are all options for adolescents.
Teen Sports and Mental Health
Moreover, youth athletes have the opportunity to gain benefits that go beyond physical activity. Specifically, teen sports also provide self-esteem, teamwork skills, and a close community of peers and supportive adults.
The Impact of School Sports on Teen Mental Health
Science provides evidence of the positive impact of teen sports. According to a Canadian study published in the Journal of Adolescent Health, students who play team sports in grades 8 through 12 have less stress and better mental health as young adults.
In the study, 850 students from 10 Canadian schools were surveyed about their participation in school sports, such as basketball, soccer, track and field, wrestling, and gymnastics.
Sports, Exercise, and Teen Mental Health
Subsequently, three years after graduation, researchers followed up with the participants. Specifically, they asked them questions about how often they experienced depressive symptoms and the amount of stress in their lives. Additionally, they asked them to rate their mental health on a scale of 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent).
The researchers found that youth who were involved in school sports had better scores on all three mental health assessments, compared with those who did not play sports at all. Therefore, the study found that playing school sports during adolescent years is significantly linked to lower depression symptoms, lower perceived stress, and better self-rated mental health in young adulthood.
In other words, playing school sports from ages 12 to 17 protects young people from poor mental health four years later.
According to study co-author Catherine Sabiston, PhD, of the University of Toronto, “Team sports offer a heightened emphasis on group goals, social support, and sense of connection that provide more opportunity for learning adaptive coping strategies that can be essential for long-term mental health.”
The Exercise-Mental Health Link
Why do teen sports benefit mental health? Scientists have been exploring the link between exercise and mood for more than 100 years. As a result, a large body of research shows that physical activity improves mental health. In particular, exercise decreases symptoms of depression.
Moreover, physical inactivity is associated with the development of psychological disorders, according to research. Thus, being inactive puts teens at a higher risk of developing mental high conditions.
However, scientists are not entirely sure why this is true.
While the investigation continues, researchers and mental health professionals have pinpointed some of the reasons.
Specifically, both biological and psychological factors come into play.
What Happens When We Exercise
Here are some of the reasons why exercise is helpful in boosting teen mental health.
Exercise positively impacts levels of serotonin, a chemical that helps regulate mental health.
Furthermore, exercise releases endorphins, the body’s natural “happy chemicals.”
Levels of the stress hormone cortisol go down when we exercise.
Additionally, physical activity also stimulates the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, which improves mood.
Teen sports, as well as other outdoor activities, get teens outside so they can experience the benefits of time in nature.
Young people who develop an athletic skill feel more positive about their bodies and their physical abilities. Therefore, their self-esteem improves.
When we are doing something that absorbs all our attention, such as sports or another physical activity, we are distracted from stressful and negative thoughts.
Athletics and other physical activities protect against substance use disorder. (We’ll discuss this in depth later in this article.)
Moreover, when teens do physical activities during the day, they sleep better at night. Sleep is essential for maintaining teen mental health.
Research on Physical Activity and Depression
Regular exercise makes a significant positive difference in terms of depression. Many studies demonstrate how physical activity counteracts depressive symptoms in both teens and adults.
Moreover, multiple studies have confirmed these results.
