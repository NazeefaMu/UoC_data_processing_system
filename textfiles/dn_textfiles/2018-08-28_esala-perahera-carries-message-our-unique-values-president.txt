Esala perahera carries message of our unique values - President

Every country possesses items unique to its culture. The Kandy Esala Pageant is one such item which carries the message about our cultural system, virtues of discipline, customs and traditions to future generations, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
The President was addressing the gathering after receiving the Sannasa bearing the successful conclusion of the Kandy Esala Perahera, from Diyawadane Nilame Pradeep Nilanga Dela, at President’s House in Kandy, on Sunday.
Earlier the Diyawadane Nilame accompanied by the Basnayake Nilames of the Four Main Devalayas and Pitisara Devalayas came in procession to hand over the Sannasa to the President.
The President said that history recorded that the Sacred Tooth Relic was brought to Sri Lanka during the reign of King Kirthi Sri Meghavanna. Ever since, it has remained as our highest and lasting object of reverence. The Kandy Esala Pageant is held in keeping with customs and traditions bequeathed to us from the time of the ancient kings.
More than being a mere spectacle, the Kandy Esala Pageant portrayed a moral and spiritual background. The large number of elephants, drummers, dancers and other artistes participating in it gave an important message to the world, in addition to dedication and competence. The pageant also encompassed several sectors, including religious and cultural sectors. Buddhism was the greatest and most valuable gift we could give to the outside world, President Sirisena said.
He said a massive historic religious and cultural festival of this nature could not be planned single-handed. A large number of people had made dedicated efforts to make it a success under the patronage and guidance of the Mahanayake Theras of the Malwatte and Asgiriya Chapters and the Mahanayake Theras of the three Nikayas.
President Sirisena, who said that it was the fourth time since 2015 that he was attending the perahera, said he personally felt that this year’s perahera was more organised and colourful than the three previous peraheras he attended.
The President said on behalf the government and the people, he wished to thank one and all who assisted to make this year’s perahera a success.
The President said this year, they were able to rehabilitate the Ranviyana of the Sri Dalada Maligawa for the second time and offer it to the Sacred Tooth Relic. He wished to thank the State Engineering Corporation and all others who helped to accomplish that task.
During the last four years, they had been able to gift the baby elephant Pulathisi Raja donated by the government of Myanmar to the Sri Dalada Maligawa.
The President said when he was handing over awards to the perahera artistes this year, he received one complaint. The complaint was that certain sections of the pehahera did not receive justice and fairplay in making the awards.
Therefore the Government Agent, Divisional Secretary and the Diyawadana Nilame should pay attention to it and try to rectify shortcomings, if there were any. The government on its part was committed to helping this event in every possible way, President Sirisena said.
