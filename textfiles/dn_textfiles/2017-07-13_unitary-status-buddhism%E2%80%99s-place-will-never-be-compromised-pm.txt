Unitary status, Buddhism’s place will never be compromised: PM

The unitary status of the country and the pre-eminent position of Buddhism will never be compromised in a new Constitution, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister was addressing a group of youth Buddhist monks at Temple Trees yesterday.
“Buddhism will never lose its pre-eminent position in the Constitution, while the unitary status of the country will not be changed,” the Prime Minister said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said no one opposes to the unitary statues of the country and the pre-eminent position of Buddhism. He said while the pre-eminent position of Buddhism is protected, the Government will ensure equal opportunities for other religions. He said the Government has no intention to intervene in the activities of temples, but is duty bound to fulfil the requirements of the youth Bhikkus.
The Prime Minister said the media should act in a responsible manner rather than levelling fabricated allegations against the Government.
“The Malwatte Chapter was threatened to be split into two during the Rajapaksa regime. It was an attempt to divide the Maha Sanga, but no media reported it, including the media organisation, that published that the Government has closed down the Dambulla temple,” he said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said there is a need to protect the frescoes of the Dambulla Raja Maha Viharaya with the blessings of the Chief Prelates of three chapters. He said the Government has no power or does not need to control temples or intervene in their issues.
