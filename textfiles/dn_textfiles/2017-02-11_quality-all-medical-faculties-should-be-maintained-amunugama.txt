Quality of all medical faculties should be maintained: Amunugama

Special Assignments Minister Sarath Amunugama stressed that not only the quality of the medical degree of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) but also the quality of all other medical graduates of all other state medical faculties including that of the Kotelawala Defence University (KDU) Medical Faculty should be measured and evaluated.
“The quality of a medical faculty should be maintained. Then the quality of all faculties of medicine and their graduates should be evaluated. Therefore, it is better to hold a common examination to measure the standards and quality of every medical graduate,” he said.
The minister was addressing a media briefing recently at the SLFP Headquarters in Colombo Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa participated.
Amunugama said the quality of the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) should also be looked in, as there should be a quality for the GMOA as well. If there is an issue with the quality of the SAITM, it should be rectified. But the agitations and allegations levelled against the SAITM by the GMOA is not justifiable. The minister said more private universities should be established since all the Advanced Level qualified students cannot be absorbed to state universities. Freedom to gain education is a right and no one can obstruct it, he said.
“SAITM was started during the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s regime with his financial assistance of Rs. 600 million. Besides the SAITM medical faculty, it was planned during the last regime to commence three more medical faculties including the KDU medical faculty.
The decision of Rajapaksa to start more private universities is a good move. But it is peculiar that he shows a totally different picture now,” he said.
The minister said local higher education institutions are better than most other such institutions in India, Bangladesh, Nepal among others.
The HIP was first mooted by the then government. It was a feeder to the Hambantota harbour and the Hambantota Airport. They cannot perform without a feeder. Establishing the HIP was also a good move of Rajapaksa,” he said.
The minister said development activities in Hambantota including the HIP were carried out through separate body called “Magampura Development Company” under the Rajapaksa regime. But Rajapaksa is opposing the HIP now,” he said.
