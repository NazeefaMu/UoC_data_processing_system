Born to discover!

The Thespians of St. Bridget’s Convent has had remarkable success in the recent past due to their unwavering faith and consistency. Dramatic Moves features the girls of St. Bridget’s Convent who say that they are at their best, when teamwork is at its best and prayers are strongest.

Teacher in Charge, Malinthi Perera called drama a discovery.
“St Bridget’s has had a long tradition of drama and the hard work of many teachers and students has been responsible for its success. Special mention must be made of the effort of Yoland Abeyweera. But an official society was probably established under Rohini Dias and Chandrani De Silva Kulasiri around the 1980s.
Drama is not just about discovering one’s talent but discovering the world. I believe that the function of drama at school is to educate our students and enable them to explore various angles of life and living. I also believe that with good team effort and the grace of God there is nothing that cannot be achieved. Students live in a challenging world today. Thus, drama is a wonderful method of instruction as well as stress relief.
We receive a lot of support from Rev Sr. Alexandra Mendis, our principal who is ever willing to encourage and advice. The students too work really hard and the seniors this year led by Saleemah have been truly wonderful to work with,” said Perera.
A strong impact
President, Saleemah Mohideen is known as a talented actress who is versatile and easy to perform with. She has played main roles in several plays.

“Our drama society is very old. It has flourished and grown with each year since 2008 under Malinthi Perera. We enjoy performing a wide variety of drama in school, mainly tragedy, dramedy (dramatic comedy) and Shakespeare. The kinds of dramas we perform also depend largely on the cast we have and the kind of audience we will perform to,” said Mohideen.
At Bridget’s the society has grown in numbers over the past few years and there are many talented enthusiasts from all grades taking part every year.
“Since everyone is welcome to join we have a wide variety of talent. Parents are mostly supportive and understand what it is like to be a thespian, but sometimes busy school schedules and other commitments prevent everyone from taking part every time,” stated Mohideen. Mohideen was pointed out that the school as it stands today has quite a lot of talent and promise from the juniors in the younger grades as well as the seniors. “Our achievements so far have been getting into the finals of every competition we have taken part in since 2008 except for the year 2009. Our main aim is to leave a strong impact on the audience and our biggest achievement is that we have managed to do so every time whether we have won or not.”
Mohideen highlighted the fact that they came overall champions Winning Shakespeare when they took part in 2008 with (Twelfth Night) and again when they participated in 2014 (Merry Wives of Windsor.)
“We came runners-up at Royal Drama Comp in the year 2015 with the suicide play Just like I Wanted. In 2016, the seniors participated in the CBB drama competition organized by the British Council and emerged Overall Champions and won the Best Director award for our production of the American War play ‘Booby Trap.’In the recently concluded Royal Drama Comp, our junior cast where students in grade 10 and below participated, managed to come runners-up with the same production of ‘Booby Trap’ and also received the Best Actress award,” explained Mohideen
Talent is in abundance at St Bridget’s. The school has a lot of dramatists of all ages and sometimes choosing and casting plays is a difficult job as there is a lot of talent everywhere.
“During my time in the drama society there have been many memorable productions but two of the most unforgettable have been our Shakespeare Competition play ‘Merry Wives of Windsor’ and the CBB play ‘Booby Trap’. The learning experience, working with the cast and directors and the final performances of those two plays have been experiences that we will not be forgetting any time soon,” added Mohideen.
“I love to do anything which provides scope for improvement of our acting overall, and I feel that a variety of emotions, which can be found in tragicomedies, is the best. We’ve done many Shakepearean plays and the one we did for the Inter school competition in 2014 (the Merry Wives of Windsor) was very memorable and was loved by the audience and judges alike,” elucidated Mohideen.
Mohideen concedes that competition is tough in the drama circuit.
“So far we have been able to handle it and set standards ourselves as well. Competing against both boys and girls schools in competitions like CBB is even more challenging.
There are many new concepts and ideas coming in from the girls themselves, and hopefully we’ll be able to showcase some of them in our annual production in October,” explained Mohideen. Their Principal along with Malinthi Perera has been a great strength to them.
“Our Principal Rev. Sr. Alexandra Mendis has been very supportive of the drama society since 2015 and encourages us to take part in competitions, workshops and events outside school as well as our annual production. Anyone who wishes to join is welcome regardless of what they can do or how talented they are. Being a part of a society such as this helps the student to grow as a person, and as a leader,” pointed out Mohideen.
The girls do a lot of character work and research, which if done properly, will help to get into character and live every aspect of that character.
“As a girl, playing a male role has always been a challenge but if one is used to playing it from one’s younger days then it comes naturally. Getting the posture, voice and mannerisms right is the main challenge,” said Mohideen.
An important activity
Secretary Thanuri Pulasha is known to be a dependable member who is easy to perform with.

“We perform tragedies, comedies, humorous plays. The strengths of our society is definitely the unity of the cast. We do have a selection of actors and actresses. Our parents are very supportive and understanding. When considering achievements, the many competitions our cast has taken part in and won, the annual productions staged, and every other activity taken part in, we consider as our achievements,” said Pulasha
“The faculty of our school is very understanding, and they also encourage us to take part in many activities, such as competitions,” stated Pulasha
Drama according to Pulasha is vital to one’s personality
“The drama society helps build up confidence and teaches discipline to the members. Therefore it could be considered as an important activity for students to take part in. Being a part of the Drama Society is beneficial to all members of any age, since it instills discipline, allows a growth in confidence, and most importantly, it helps develop ones abilities in performance, whether it be acting, dancing, or any other,” explained Pulasha.
The main strengths
Assistant Secretary Druvinka Waas has been a Member of the Society since the age of 11 where she acted as a little hedgehog. She has also participated in every production since then. She is a flexible actress and easily directed.

“Over the years we've performed comedies, tragedies, classics, modern plays and everything in between. I think one of the main strengths of our drama society is the enthusiasm and passion for drama our school/ members have and their commitment and dedication towards drama. But of course none of this would be possible without the immense support and encouragement we get from our parents and our school,” pointed out Waas.
In the recent past the girls have really achieved a lot.
“We have gotten into the finals in every competition we have participated in since the year 2008 except once. Some of our recent achievements are winning the CBB drama competition in 2016, and the Shakespeare drama competition in 2014 as well as becoming runners up at the CBB drama competition in 2013 and the Royal Interact Drama Competition in 2015 & 2017,” explained Waas.
Different genres
Co-Editor Shontaal Manuelpillai is a committed actress. “The younger ones are definitely ready to take on the mantle and carry drama at St. Bridget’s into the future. A recent example is the Royal Drama Competition that took place this year where are Junior cast from Grades 9 and 10 took part and were placed second. They competed against some of the leading schools in drama,” said Manuelpillai

When it comes to exploring different possibilities in drama Manuelpillai pointed out that there are different genres that they would like to try out in terms of plays, but the audience needs to be considered when wanting to attempt anything new
“We make sure that drama and school work do not interfere with each other and the students make sure that they are capable of balancing everything before practices begin. We take characterization extremely seriously. Even before roles are confirmed, we make sure that we know a backstory for all the characters. We characterize in a way, that we eat, breathe and sleep the lives of our characters, which has been noted and praised during numerous performances,” explained Manuelpillai.
A special achievement
“The Drama Society now has over a hundred students. The greatest achievement of the society we believe has been its consistency over the past few years. Since 2008, we have been selected for the finals at every competition we have participated in except one.
The 2008 win was a special achievement as we won the Shakespeare trophy after a gap of 12 years.
The focus of our society is teamwork. We feel that our best wins have always been at times when teamwork was at its best and prayers were strongest. We have achieved much with the grace of God.
Discipline also plays a big part in whatever we do. We have many strict rules, which enable such a large society to function as it does with minimum hitches. Drama helps us learn many things but most importantly, Drama is fun.
We are a society that works on a very low budget usually. We try to do as much work as possible by ourselves including making our own props.
Our teacher in charge Malinthi Perera has been a true pillar of strength to us throughout. She manages the role of a strict disciplinarian and a motherly figure very well. Our principal Rev Sr. Alexandra too has been a source of encouragement to us at all times. We can honestly say that we could not have achieved everything we did without her support.
