In line with lines

Architecture is about bringing the spirit into space. It can help you reduce stress with the skill of the architect. Arch World meets up with architect Shobha Senaviratna who shared with us how she creates this magic.
“Stress can occur for many reasons. Maybe too much of work. When you come back home after work, the home has to be peaceful where you can release stress. Your home has to be a relaxing place to calm your mind. After identifying the client’s requirements and lifestyle, planning the orientation of the building is the most important thing. This is again the positive energy which I touched on in the previous article,” said Senaviratna.
If you orient the building in the proper manner, you will get more sunlight and cross ventilation.
“You can bring the spirit into space. You get a lot of energy. When you enter a space, you must feel relaxed. When space is cluttered, you need to get out of the place. Sometimes when you have a house that is too big, cleaning will be a problem. That causes more stress. When arranging spaces, there has to be a certain order. The finish matters a lot. It has to be user friendly. Colours can do a lot,” stated Senaviratna.
A house can be a brand new one designed by an architect or it can be a refurbished one. Some houses could be on rent. Maybe it is a built house and needs some renovation. If it is a brand new design, it is easier for an architect. If it is an existing one, they have more work.
“If spaces are tiny, you have to go with soothing colours. When you enter, you have to feel the space. Sometimes you may apply black colour for the ceiling. You need to have a knowledge of colours. When you apply black, you feel the ceiling is very low.
“If the ceiling is low, you would feel very stuffy. Especially if you are a six footer you will feel the space is not enough. We choose a light colour, cool colour and white colour. The ceiling is still the same level but you feel it is at a higher level. These are the tricks,” explained Senaviratna.
Architecture can release stress. Orientation and planning is important. Spaces have to be simple. The inside - outside connectivity is important. When you connect with the outside, we feel the boundary wall. We feel free. That is the capability of designers.
“Architecture is a combination of art and science. Art is all about music, dancing and painting. When it comes to art, you can enjoy it visually. But when it comes to architecture, it is combination of art and science because you have to construct it. As architects, we have to learn both,” pointed out Senaviratna.
Lines also matter. We define spaces out of lines.
“Let’s say your living space has zig- zag lines or your furniture is zig- zag shaped. If you have a zig- zag shaped furniture piece, you don’t feel comfortable. Because it is a harsh edge. When you get a series of harsh edges, you are not comfortable. It is a little scary because it is a harsh edge. When you have natural rhythms, curvy or simple, straight forward, vertical and horizontal, then it is friendlier and the movements are easy. For example, if a reception desk is curvy, more people can move. You have to apply these things in planning because then the stress will be less. Your mind is peaceful with enough light and ventilation, the movements are happening nicely. Due to colours, textures and proportions, it is harmonious,” elucidated Senaviratna.
“There are many other considerations – according to the average humans, there is a certain height of the chair because you have different chairs – you have a sofa and normal chairs. Likewise even the staircase, there is the minimum height and width of the step. If not we are not comfortable. Everything has to be applied,” added Senaviratna.
With regard to architecture, most people think that it is a few lines together and spaces but there is much more. It is not only a building.
“Sri Lanka is a tropical country. We have to know how we are going to take sunlight into interior spaces and how to take the wind in. If we design accordingly we don’t need air conditioning or a fan even in an urban context. Architecture is a wonderful thing. Architecture can contribute to mental health and it can make your mind clear. Just think if you are living in a hot stuffy dark room, then you will feel drowsy and you won’t be comfortable in that place,” informed Senaviratna.
Senaviratna also shared with the Daily News some of her perspectives on the history of architecture in Sri Lanka.
“When you take our particular architectural language, ancient Sri Lankan architecture is dominated by caves and temples. If you take the ancient Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa era, it is dominated by dagabas, stupas and temples. But when the Portuguese, Dutch and British came to Sri Lanka, they tried to adapt their styles with Sri Lankan tropics,” said Senaviratna.
She pointed out that considering Town Hall and the Old Parliament buildings they have that character. Even the Queens Hotel in Kandy, it is not the Kandyan architecture, it is the Colonial architecture!
“Colonial architecture introduced a lot of things such as gothic columns and European columns and also the panel doors like what you have at Barefoot Gallery. You can still see those colonial elements in modern day Sri Lanka with even the verandahs and roofs and the bungalows,” stated Senaviratna.
Post Independence, we were influenced by our ancient architectural and colonial architectural styles.
“With regard to ancient architecture, houses and dwellings were mostly vernacular architecture. They used eco- friendly materials and built simple houses. Then in the third century, in Anuradhapura and Pollonnaruwa, they had nine story buildings as well. We are inspired by architectural styles of India as well. Then the Colonial rulers came. So new materials came in and got changed,” pointed out Senaviratna.
In tropical climates you get more sun and wind, and the rain beats. So colonials introduced high pitched sloping roofs and long eaves – the extension of the roof towards the Verandah. Protecting the doors, windows and walls as well. Because of Sri Lankan climate conditions, people want to extend to the outdoors, so they have big verandahs as we have no winter.
“In ancient houses, when examining the courtyard concept, it is more than just getting in sunlight and ventilation, it has a practical aspect as well. There is a habit, the mother or the lady of the house works while the children play in the inner courtyard, inside the premises of the house. So security is guaranteed, with the children playing inside the house. So she can work peacefully,” pointed out Senaviratna.
So in the olden days people were very careful and nature friendly. We waste so many things. But they were very thoughtful. They harvested water.
“Most activities happen in the inner central courtyard. It is not small it is huge. Sometimes they even had a well in the courtyard. They even had a very good water harvesting system. They connect the gutters and they collect it into a tank. That is how they harvested water,” clarified Senaviratna. Our particular architectural language is a combination of all of this with the present day modernism.
In order to facilitate fusion you should know the history, the traditional and the modern. Fusion is not an easy thing. So you should know your business. If you take a country – its culture, the behavior of the people, history, identity, is represented from the buildings.
“When it comes to Colombo it is hard to get an identity. The old parliament is of the colonial period. Then you get all the hotels representing the modern.
Then there is Bambalapitiya and then when it comes to Wellawatte there is a different identity - the buildings, culture, music, fashion and even the aroma. In Bambalapitiya it is a mixed community. But when you are in Bambalapitiya, with the recent development, sometimes you feel like you are in Singapore or sometimes you feel like you are in Malaysia.
For example in London when you are in Alperton, you don’t feel you are in London. People are speaking in Hindu and Tamil. They all speak in their language not in English,” shared Senaviratna.
