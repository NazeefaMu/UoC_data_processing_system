US prepares for Black Moon

 
US: A so-called Black Moon will plunge the United States into darkness on Monday, August 21, when a total solar eclipse completely blocks out the light from the sun.
The eclipse will be visible from coast-to-coast in the US - the first of its kind in 99 years.
The breathtaking event will last two minutes and 40 seconds for those watching from the path of totality, getting gradually shorter the further away from the centre you stand. “It brings people to tears,” Rick Fienberg, of the American Astronomical Society, told Space.com. “It makes people's jaw drop.”
There is no accepted definition of a Black Moon, but the term has come to describe a number of astronomical phenomenons associated with the New Moon.
This is the part of the lunar cycle where none of the Moon’s surface is visible from Earth. Black Moon is not a term used by the astronomical community, but it has become popular on social media and is used regularly by astrologists and followers of the some Pagan religions.
Next week’s total eclipse in the US falls into this category of Black Moon.
It occurs when there are four New Moons in a season, rather than the usual three. These moons rise once every 33 months.
The last one rose on February 18, 2015 and the next will be on May 22, 2020.
The most common use of the term is when there are two New Moons in a single calendar month.
Occurring once every 29 months or so, this type of Black Moon is the exact opposite of a Blue Moon, which is where there are two Full Moons in a month.
The next one will rise on August 30, 2019.
