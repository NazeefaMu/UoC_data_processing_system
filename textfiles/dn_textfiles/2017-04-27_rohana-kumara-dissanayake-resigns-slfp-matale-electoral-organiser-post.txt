Rohana Kumara Dissanayake resigns from SLFP Matale Electoral Organiser post

Former MP Rohana Kumara Dissanayake said he would resign from the SLFP Matale Electoral Organiser post with effect from yesterday as a tribute to his mother.
The former MP made this observation when former President Mahinda Rajapaksa came to his house to pay last respects to his mother. The former MP said he took that decision to express his dissatisfaction to the move to remove former Minister Janaka Bandara Thennakoon from the Dambulla Electoral Organiser post.
While requesting the other SLFP electorate organisers to follow suit, he commended the decision made by Pramitha Thennakoon to resign from his provincial ministerial portfolio.
