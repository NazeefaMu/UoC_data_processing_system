‘WIM creates great platform to show talent of women’

 Women in Management (WIM) will be organising an awards ceremony on July 14, 2017 at Cinnamon Grand hotel in Colombo.
Women in Management and IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, are inviting nominations for the ‘Top 50’ Professional and Career Women Awards 2017, seventh edition.
These awards recognize women who inspire others with their successes in career, business, and everyday life.
IFC and WIM work together in Sri Lanka to provide skill-building and training opportunities for women who lead, or work in, micro and small businesses. This is the third consecutive year that IFC will partner with WIM to host the Professional and Career Women Awards.
The Founder/Chairperson of Women in Management, Sulochana Segera speaking to Daily News Business said, “This year the Professional and Career Women Awards would open for and targeting young women coming in for this, also the rural women who have done something extraordinary and new. This year we are expecting more women to apply by themselves and people have enough time to apply because the awards ceremony will be held in July.”
“The specialty of this award is that we are giving for the uniqueness and by getting this award, they can brand themselves. They can be role models for other people. We are asking women to be award winners and they should target to achieve this once in a lifetime opportunity. We request women to stand up for themselves; no one is going to stand up for them. My message for women is don’t wait till the world come to you but you should go to the world and achieve something unique,” she said.
Nominations for awards are open from February 25 to May 30, 2017. The awards ceremony will be held on July 14, at the Cinnamon Grand hotel in Colombo.
Last year, around 50 women received the awards for achievements across multiple categories. Nominations can be made by visiting www.womeninmanagementawards.org.
