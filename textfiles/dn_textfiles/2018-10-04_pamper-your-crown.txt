Pamper your CROWN

Aromatic oils can work wonders for your mind and body. Head massages are great forms of relaxation as they can help you release the tension of the day. Plus they can also assist with a variety of physical and emotional problems and concerns. So if you desire thick, shiny, and beautiful hair then make head massage an integral part of your hair care ritual
Defining a scalp massage
A scalp massage is a head massage designed to relax the mind and encourage circulation. Many times, tension is felt within the head and neck, so scalp massages can be very much effective as a stress reducer. Warm oil is massaged throughout the scalp, working to relax tight muscles in the temple and neck regions.
Types of head massages
 Indian or Champissage: This is a vigorous treatment and focuses on the blood circulation for head, shoulders, and neck. Although it can be deeper pressure, it should not be painful.
Tibetan Scalp Massage: This is a very relaxing experience involving acupressure and the balancing of energy pathways. It is often a slow, detailed treatment.
Ayurvedic Massage: This is a very relaxing head massage treatment that involves pouring a tiny stream of warm, herbal oil over the third eye (forehead) for 30 to 45 minutes, followed by a few minutes of head and face massage.
Since these traditional massage techniques use a generous amount of oil for the massage, you may want to plan on a trip home for a shampoo before venturing out in public. It’s well worth it!
Signs that you need a scalp massage
You’ve been getting headaches: When the muscles around your shoulders, back and head get tight, tension headaches can begin. Regular maintenance massage can relieve these tension headaches and help promote healthy posture. Massage therapy has been shown to provide some relief for migraine sufferers as well.
 You are stressed out: Let’s face it. Most of us have a little more stress in our lives than what is probably healthy. One of the best ways to decrease levels of stress hormones and increase levels of endorphins is to get a massage. Massage therapy starts working immediately to help you relax.
Massages to stimulate hair growth
Massages help your hair grow as fast as possible. Scalp massages stimulate the blood circulation and this in turn channels more nutrients to the hair roots. The increased circulation ensures the best starting conditions for every individual hair.
Benefits of a scalp massage
Headache relief
Scalp massage can help relieve tension headaches. When performing a scalp massage on someone with a tension headache, spend extra time on the base of the skull, near the hairline, because tension often accumulates in this area. It can also help to include a massage of the forehead and temples when massaging to relieve a tension headache. Scalp massage can also help relieve symptoms of migraine headaches in some individuals.
Increased circulation to scalp
Scalp massage helps improve circulation of blood to the head and face. Increased circulation at the roots of hair can promote healthy hair growth. If oil is used for the scalp massage, it can also help get rid of dandruff. The use of oil on the scalp can also help prevent new dandruff from occurring.
Feeling of well-being
Scalp massage feels great and can help you feel more relaxed and content. If the face is included in the scalp massage, as is often the case, it can also help reduce the appearance of wrinkles, because the face is less pinched when relaxed.
Better sleep
Those who suffer from insomnia can find relief from having a scalp massage. Many people sleep better when they have regular massage, with improvement in both falling asleep and staying asleep. Conversely, scalp massage can also help those with fatigue feel more energized.

Selecting the massage oil
Choosing the massage oil also depends on your hair type.
If you have a specific condition that needs to be treated you can use an oil that may help with this condition. Here are a few options of oils that can be used for different hair types.
Coconut oil: Coconut oil is one of my favourite oils. Not only does it promote growth, it also softens and conditions hair.
Olive oil: Olive oil is a little on the heavy side. It contains vitamin A, Vitamin E, and moisturizes the scalp and the hair.
Avocado oil: Avocado oil is great especially if your hair is dry, since it is super moisturizing.
Jojoba oil: Jojoba oil in a way, reminds me of coconut oil. It doesn’t weigh down your hair, yet it leaves it soft and manageable
Almond oil: I have never tried almond oil, however, I will be trying it soon. It nourishes hair while conditioning and promoting growth.
