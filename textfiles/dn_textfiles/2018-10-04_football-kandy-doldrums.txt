Football in Kandy in the doldrums

Why is football in Kandy at club level nowhere on the field? This is the question on every football fan’s lips. There are plans, by some keen football lovers to score and help football regain its former glory when Kandy produced top class players who went on to sport national colors. If this is to happen then it is essential that a new set of competent promoters should serve in the committee.
Today football in Kandy is in the doldrums, from 1988 to 2001 the sport flourished, but sad to say, the sport is now at a low ebb. In the last two year’s no AGM or tournaments have been held.
If not for some schools games, there is hardly any football. Kandy today is finding it difficult to keep the game alive at club level. Football at club level is breathing its last or is almost dead.
The talent is there and the administrators should organize tournaments. There are people who come from Colombo and Gampola before an AGM and have closed door meetings and finally mess it up.
The Kandy Association Football League is nearly 95 years old and some of the football lovers who served as officials and players have planned to celebrate the occasion.
Though football has been played for over 150 years in Kandy, the KAFL was formed in 1925, and Kandy is one of the founder members of the football governing body.
A look back into Kandy football reveals that the sport in Kandy had its origins in the mid-1920s. This was during the 2nd World War when the British Units were stationed in Kandy. Onetime Commander in Chief of Allied Forces in South East Asia, Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten had his headquarters in the hill capital and saw to the growth of the game.
At one time the Kandy League was only second to the Colombo League team wise, with over 40 teams participating in three groups A, B and C. Today, even the people who are involved in Kandy football are ignorant as to when football started in Kandy. Sad to say there are not even ten clubs in action, no tournaments at domestic level are being played.
From the early years of barefoot competitions to the present age of sophisticated football, Kandy has played a vital role in its growth, but today football is not on a good footing.
A few years back FFSL, made a big show in Kandy, saying Kandy will get a modern football stadium at Dangolla, through FIFA and the foundation stone was laid in 2013. It’s now over five years nothing has happened only the stone remains which is a sad indictment on those who govern the game. Football is in the doldrums in Kandy mainly due to the alleged mismanagement of FFSL over the years. A few years back, the controlling body’s president of that time messed up Kandy football. In a surprise move the hard working committee was dissolved and a new committee was appointed, that was the start of the slide.
From that day, they have failed to complete a single tournament in a proper manner. An English football coach who visited Kandy, after watching rugby recently said that when he was here some years ago, football was the most popular sport in Kandy. But today rugby is more popular.
Kandy won the All Island senior and junior league championship for the first time under the presidency of B.M. Liyanage and H. Marikar. With this win Kandy toured Nepal, the first time a team went overseas. What the controlling body should do is to appoint an interim committee and run football in Kandy until it is properly organized. They should obtain the support of those who have done great service to this game in the past. In the good old days, the winners of the league and the knockouts were presented with Rs. 150,000 cash award.
In the FFSL’s competition, it is sad to say that no team from Kandy is participating. Holding office for prestige sake is not what is required now.
People must come forward and serve football. Most officials holding office are only keen on coaching and refereeing for financial benefits.
If football in Kandy is to improve the controlling body must put the leagues on the correct path.
