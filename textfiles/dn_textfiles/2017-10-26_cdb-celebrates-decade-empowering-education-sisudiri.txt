CDB celebrates decade of empowering education with Sisudiri

Celebrating a decade of empowering young people to maximize their academic prowess, Citizens Development Business Finance (CDB) presented 50 scholarships under its flagship CDB Sisudiri Scholarship Programme, which has been held consecutively since 2008.
This CSR initiative which is constructed upon the platform of rewarding high achievers in both the Grade Five Scholarship and GCE Ordinary Level examinations, enables students from marginalized or financially disadvantaged families to continue their education uninterrupted, helping them sustain their educational paths and attain their career aspirations unhindered.
Believing strongly that educated young people have exponential potential to become future leaders of this nation by mapping a path of impressive progress, CDB’s MD and CEO Mahesh Nanayakkara detailed that CDB’s strong history in investing in education is aimed at shaping the macro future of the country. “The CDB Sisudiri Scholarship Programme enables students who have immense potential to equip themselves with the imperative tools and competencies to realize their dreams. These scholarships ensure financial security and stability which ultimately leads to these young people developing confidence and the ability to compete in today’s competitive workplace with a quality education that encourages productivity and new thought processes.”
The annual scholarship programme presents a total of fifty grants per year and is based on an unbiased and transparent selection process. CDB opens out the application process to all students including Ranketi Savings Account Holders as well, to expand the scope of its community investment in education.
Twenty students who excelled at the Grade Five Scholarship examination receive Rs 50,000 as a cash grant and is spread over a period of five years, assisting them to step unhindered into their Ordinary Level studies and complete their secondary education. Rs 30,000 each was presented to thirty students who gained top marks at the Ordinary Level examination, enabling these students to complete their Advanced Level examinations in preparation for mapping their future careers.
To date, CDB has granted a total of 410 scholarships worth Rs. 17.5 million, some of which have prompted some extraordinary success stories.
