Coca-Cola partners Sri Lanka Red Cross for flood relief operations in Gampaha

Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka, joined hands with the Sri Lanka Red Cross Society Gampaha Branch, to carry out intensive emergency disaster relief and rehabilitation activities following the severe floods.
Coca-Cola focused on the immediate needs of distribution of safe, clean water and the provision of medical camps to those left vulnerable in the Biyagama and Dompe Divisions.
The emergency relief operation was mainly carried out in the flood-affected areas of Yabaraluwa, Mabima, Bollegala, Thelwatta, Ambaraluwa of Biyagama Division and Malwana, Kanukatiya, Pahala Mapitigama, Nikawela, Giridhara and Kapugoda of Dompe Division.
Furthermore, in a step towards rehabilitation; facilitating the return to their daily lives, the Company engaged in cleaning all contaminated wells of the Biyagama Division, totalling 600 wells.
Echoing the disastrous effects of the floods in 2016, last month’s natural disaster once again left Gampaha residents feeling vulnerable and isolated by the flood waters, while being exposed to health issues in the aftermath such as the risk of Dengue and waterborne diseases.
Volunteers of Biyagama and Dompe Red Cross executed the operation and technical support was provided by the relevant area  Government officers; Grama Niladharis, Public Health Inspectors, Ministry of Health and Divisional Secretariats.
Volunteers from Coca-Cola were active in the medical camps and in delivering water to affected families and individuals, as additional operational support on the ground in the week after the floods were of great need. The Company ensured that distribution of over 10,000 litres of water was executed through deliveries on-foot, by trucks and by boat, to access areas isolated by the remaining flood waters.
Medical camps, Mobile camps and First Aid services were conducted through 16 service events providing access for essential healthcare to 2,129 affected individuals in the first week after the flooding began.
Medical Officer of Health, Biyagama, Kumari Wijesuriya said, “The recent floods in Sri Lanka caused devastating loss to life and property, leaving many communities helpless.”
Commenting on Coca-Cola’s flood relief operations, Mayank Arora, Managing Director of Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd said, “Coca-Cola responded to the recent floods by providing those affected with access to water and medical camps.”
