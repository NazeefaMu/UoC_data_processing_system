Fire in Wellawaya “Wadinahelaya” forest reserve

It was reported that the fire which broke out at Wellawaya “Wadinahelaya” forest reserve had destroyed over 200 acres of forest reserve.
However the fire was controlled to some extend day before with the help of the soldiers of the Gamunu Regiment and Singha regiments of Sri Lanka Army.
“It was also divulged that apart from the destruction of over 200 acres of forest reserve, many animals too had perished in the fire. Due to the dry weather and strong wind conditions, the fire had spread rapidly,” Disaster Management Centre officials said.
However, the reason for this fire hasn't been ascertained as yeat, but the residents of the area are suspicious that it could have been caused by hunters who often visit the forest reserve. Wellawaya Police are investigating.
