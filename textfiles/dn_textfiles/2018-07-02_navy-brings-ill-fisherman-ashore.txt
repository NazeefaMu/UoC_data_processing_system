Navy brings ill fisherman ashore

The Navy brought ashore a fisherman suffering from a chest pain. He was fishing in deep seas on Saturday when he got the chest pain.
The patient was on the multiday trawler Ishan Putha 03, which had left the Galle fisheries harbour for fishing.
Responding to information disseminated by the Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, Sri Lanka Navy dispatched a Fast Attack Craft attached to the Southern Naval Command to the location.
Naval personnel reached the trawler in the seas about nine nautical miles off the Galle Light House and safely brought the patient to the Galle Harbour. The patient was rushed to the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital, a Navy spokesman said.
