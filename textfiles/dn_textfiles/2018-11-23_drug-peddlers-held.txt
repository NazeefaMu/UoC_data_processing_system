Drug-peddlers held

Two young men smuggling drugs had been arrested by the Negombo Police Anti-Corruption Unit in Thelwatte, Negombo, on Tuesday night. They had 3.5 grams of heroin in their possession at the time of the arrest.
One of them had previously been arrested at Badalgama, Akurangaha, before he was released. He had also been been arrested in connection with the murder of a four-year-old girl called Seya Sedewmi in Kotadeniyawa, in 2015.
The suspects were arrested while transporting heroin to Negombo and Badalgama from Dematagoda, police said. The suspects were to be produced in courts.
