PARLIAMENT

 
Education must improve for country’s economic development - Premier
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Parliament yesterday, the country’s economic development would take place only if the education system is improved.
The Prime Minister made this observation while replying to a question raised by UNP MP Ashu Marasinghe, during the ‘Prime Minister’s Question Time’.
The PM said free education system will not be abolished. Our aim is to provide every child a pre school education, primary education, a secondary education, university education and tertiary education, to give them a better future. Advisers in the Education Ministry are now formulating a new national educational system which would make school education compulsory for every child. Once this Bill is ready, it will be forwarded to the Select Committee on educational matters for more suggestions. If school education is not strong enough, university education too would not be useful, he said.
Laboratories in many schools were opened during the former regime without upgrading University education. But, maximum benefits have not reaped from these projects. Action had also been taken to draft laws to regulate degree awarding institutions. We have to think twice about a university education and should restructure it. Today human resources in the university education system is not used efficiently. The University Act was introduced in 1978. Now the authorities are keen to grant more autonomy to universities. We have to increase autonomy to universities to upgrade the education system. The curricular in the university system should have to be developed. Many universities are not been limited to grant general degree programmes, while there is no improvement of awarding post graduate degrees at many universities. We have to upgrade the quality in degree programmes in order to increase the value of university education which would help to address the needs of the international job market, the Prime Minister added.
 
 
Anura, Bandula object tonon inclusion of questions in PM’s question time
Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake and UPFA MP Bandula Gunawardena in Parliament yesterday, raised objections for failing to include the two questions submitted by them for the Prime Minister’s question round.
Their questions were not taken up at the Prime Minister’s Question Time yesterday, following a decision taken at the Party Leaders’ Meeting last month that the questions asked at this time slot must be handed over 5 days in advance.
However, MP Anura Dissanayake objecting to this decision, stated that it was not practical to raise matters of national importance five days in advance. “My question was pertaining to the IMF loan pursued by the Government including its amount, time-frame and conditions. This is an important question.
The Prime Minister could reply to these questions by memory alone,” he said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said his officials need sufficient time to obtain information from the relevant bodies to respond to the questions directed at him.
“I cannot rebuke my officials asking for information immediately.
If we are to continue with this feature, let us think of a practical way,” he said.
MP Bandula Gunawardena at this point requested to permit submissions of questions via email.
Prime Minister’s Question Time contained only two questions yesterday, due to the non-inclusion of the two questions due to late submission.
 
Bill presented to enable SL become member of AIIB
The Government yesterday in Parliament presented a Bill to enable Sri Lanka to become a member of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank(AIIB).
Chief Government Whip and Mass Media and Parliamentary Reforms Minister Gayantha Karunathilake presented the Bill on behalf of the Finance Minister.
The Bill titled The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Agreement (Ratification) provides for the Finance Minister, on behalf of the Government, to ratify, accept Articles of Agreement establishing the AIIB, to which Sri Lanka is a signatory.
Sri Lanka signed the Articles of Agreement with AIIB in June last year. The AIIB was founded in October 2014 and is a development bank consisting of 21 Asian member countries.
‘Financial institutions must be regulated’
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament yesterday, that financial institutions have to be regulated in order to strengthen the rural economy.
He said especially microfinace companies should be regulated to create a strong local economy which would create an environment conducive for foreign investments. There are a number of non government financial entities and micro finance entities at regional level to national level. Some rural people have been duped into depositing money in dubious financial institutions in the recent past because these are not regulated properly.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe moving the Microfinance Bill for debate, said present laws are not sufficient to regulate banks, financial companies and microfinance institutions. There is a exploitation of the consumers. Around 10 to 11 financial companies have turned bankrupt. Most of them are making losses which had affected investors, depositors and under privileged people in
rural level very badly.
If these are not regulated properly, national level finance will not be in a healthy position. They might become a threat to the country. Thus, only a very few people would attempt to direct the Stock Market and the financial system. There are large scale pyramid schemes in our country, while most of them are operating in Tissamaharamaya, Hambantota and Batticaloa as well. Perhaps, these existed because our laws are insufficient.
Once this Bill is passed, the Committee on financial matters could suggest more proposals in this regard. Laws have been submitted on the management and regulation and issuing of licenses for finance institutions under this Bill, he said.
Complaints against 114 public servants, five artistes and 18 businessmen to FCID - Sagala
There have been complaints against 114 public servants, five artistes and 18 businessmen to the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015, Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayake revealed in Parliament yesterday.
When, UPFA MP Prasanna Ranatunga asked for the list of names of public servants, artistes and businessman who have been subjected to allegations, the Minister declined to provide the names saying that investigations are still underway and it was therefore not suitable to reveal their names at this point. Since none of them had been found guilty upto now, if the names are revealed, their careers might be affected, the Minister further said.
 
Sectoral Oversight Committees should incorporate all Parliamentarians - Speaker
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday stated in Parliament that the Sectoral Oversight Committees should essentially incorporate all MPs.
He was responding to the concerns raised by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake and UPFA MP Bandula Gunawardena that the names of some MPs had not been included into any of the Oversight Committees and that some MPs had been appointed to the Committees they did not request for. The Speaker directed the issue to the notice of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The Prime Minister directed the matter to be settled by discussing at the Party Leaders’ Meeting. However, he said the process of oversight committees should not be further delayed.
Replying to a query by MP Bandula Gunawardena over handing over the chairmanship of the newly appointed Sectoral Oversight Committees to the Opposition, the Prime Minister said chairmanship of the majority of them would go to Opposition parties.
The Sectoral Oversight Committees is a new procedure adopted in Parliament in place of Consultative Committees.
Sports Minister says: Fresh probe into entry of woman into cricketer’s room
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera told Parliament yesterday that the Cricket Executive Committee would commence a fresh investigation into the entry of a woman connected to the gambling business to a room occupied by an Indian cricketer at Hotel Kandalama during India’s visit to Sri Lanka for the 2010 Asia Cup.
In answer to a question raised by UNP MP SM Marikkar, the minister said Sri Lanka Cricket did not have any document concerning the matter.
He accepted that a woman had entered the cricketer’s room at Hotel Kandalama during the night of June 18 and remained throughout the night.
Such an incident had taken place, the minister said. He accepted that a letter by Major General Lawrence Fernando had been dispatched directly to the Manager of the Indian Cricket team with a copy to the Secretary, the Additional Secretary, the Additional Executive Officer and the Anti-Corruption Officer of the International Cricket Council.
The minister said there were no remarks regarding the said incident in the minutes of the Interim Committee of Sri Lanka Cricket meetings held in 2010.
MP Marikkar questioned the minister whether the latter was aware that there was an effort of offering a bribe according to the contents of the letter, the minister said that there had been an attempt of accepting a bribe.
MP Marikkar said the then Sri Lanka Cricket Secretary Nishantha Ranatunga was the local agent of an Indian cement company owned by the owner of the Chennai Super Kings Team, to which the Indian player participated at the Indian Premier League and demanded to know whether that connection was the reason for the missing documents pertaining to the inquiry against the said cricketer from Sri Lanka Cricket.

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament yesterday, that Sri Lanka’s Deputy High Commissioner in Chennai has been appointed an Assistant Registrar to document births and marriages of Sri Lankan refugees living in India.

The Department of Immigration & Emigration in Sri Lanka will issue passports in just within two to three weeks for Sri Lankan refugees who wish to return to Sri Lanka.
All legal and other obstacles preventing the return of Sri Lankan refugees in India would be abolished and efforts have been made to facilitate their return.
