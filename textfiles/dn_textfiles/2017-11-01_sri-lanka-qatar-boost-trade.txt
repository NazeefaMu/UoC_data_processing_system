Sri lanka, Qatar to boost trade

In his closing statements following two days of trade talks between Sri Lanka and Qatar, Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen said it was time to take a “fresh look” at trade relations between the two countries.
“The level of trade between our two countries has not been very impressive over the last years,” he said, citing that two-way trade fell from US$ 48 million in 2015 to US$ 45 million in 2016.
Delegates from Sri Lanka and Qatar held trade talks at the Cinnamon Lakeside Hotel on Monday and Tuesday, as the second session of the Sri Lanka-Qatar Joint Committee on Economic, Commercial and Technical Cooperation. The meetings come at a time of tension for Qatar, as the country faces a diplomatic freeze from its Gulf neighbors, led by Saudi Arabia.
“As you all know the meetings of this committee comes in the wake of the illegal blockage imposed by the neighbouring countries, which aims to undermine the stance of the State of Qatar as an economically independent and sovereign nation,” said Sheikh Ahmed bin Jassim bin Mohammad Al Thani, the Qatari Minister of Economy and Commerce. But both leaders said the discussions held economic potential for the two countries.
Minister Bathiudeen said that the “discussions were fruitful and resulted in many positive outcomes,” specifically for the power and energy, aviation, hospitality, industry, and agriculture sectors.
“We look forward, through this committee, to find mechanisms to increase the volume of trade between our two countries,” Sheikh Al Thani said.
President Maithripala Sirisena also visited Qatar on an official visit last week, where he met with its Emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani.
