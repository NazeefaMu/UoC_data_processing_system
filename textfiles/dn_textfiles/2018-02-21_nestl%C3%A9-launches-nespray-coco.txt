Nestlé launches Nespray Coco-Up

Combining the goodness of Nespray milk and the refreshing taste of coconut, Nespray Coco-Up Ready-to-Drink (RTD) is Nestlé’s latest innovation. Milky and delicious, with a subtle nutty taste, Nespray Coco-Up is made with Sri Lankan milk and coconut. It contains no added artificial colours or preservatives, and is the country’s first dairy milk beverage to be enhanced with coconut extract. It is also the first product of its kind for Nestlé worldwide.
Coconut is a much loved staple of cuisine in Sri Lanka and around the world, pepping up any meal or drink with a distinct and refreshing taste.
Ruwan Welikala, Vice President - Dairy for Nestlé said: “Nespray has always been a milk brand trusted by mothers to provide their children with a strong nutritional foundation. It offers a range of local milk products that cater to children’s varying tastes and needs. With its innovative recipe of fresh milk and coconut, Nespray Coco-Up now joins our strong portfolio with a unique consumption experience, making drinking milk more fun, adventurous and refreshing for kids.”
The product is the brainchild of Nestlé’s world leading R&D, and benefits from the company’s expertise in child nutrition, and milk and coconut processing. Nestlé is the largest milk company in the world in terms of sales value, and the largest private sector collector of fresh milk in Sri Lanka; buying milk from close to 20,000 local farmers every day. The company is the market leader for local milk-based beverages and has been manufacturing dairy products in Sri Lanka since 1984.
Nestlé is also one of the world’s largest exporters of coconut milk powder, positively impacting the livelihoods of more than 6,000 local coconut growers through its business. Its Nestlé Coconut Plan also supports new farmers and home growers to cultivate coconut successfully.
The company has been manufacturing coconut milk powder in its factory in Kurunegala since the 1980’s, using exclusively Sri Lankan coconut, and supplies Nestlé markets worldwide.
Shivani Hegde, Nestlé Managing Director, said: “Innovation is in our DNA, ever since our company was founded more than 150 years ago. Today we continue to provide innovative, science-based products and services that enhance quality of life. We’re proud to offer our local consumers a variety of products made from local fresh milk, with the latest being Nespray Coco-Up with the unique infusion of coconut. This innovation perfectly reflects Nestlé in Sri Lanka; combining cutting-edge global technology and R&D with local innovation - using local ingredients and strong local consumer insights - to develop superior products.”
Best consumed chilled, Nespray Coco-Up is available at leading supermarkets across the country. Nespray Coco-Up joins Nespray Fortigrow, Nespray Everyday and Nespray Nutri-Up in Nespray’s portfolio of products made with local milk.
