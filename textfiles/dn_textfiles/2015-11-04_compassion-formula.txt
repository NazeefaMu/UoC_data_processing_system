The compassion formula!

If there ever was a cameo interview that encapsulated the very essence of a man it would be today's tale from Diyawanna - Parliamentarian Dilum Suraj Bandara Amunugama who fervently believes in world peace and the power of doing good. Dilum is a man who puts everyone at ease with his easy charm.
Early days
Amunugama's father was in the Military and his mother worked at an NGO. His uncle Sarath Amunugama needs no introduction. Amunugama had a relatively normal childhood with a sister, and every day he spent at Trinity College was a matter of pride to him and everyday was important. Every calendar day at school was important.
His pride
Hard work is nothing new to Amunugama. That is what got him to where he is today. A politician is only as good as his electorate. Amunugama has always kept the power of the people in mind and his responsibility towards them having voted him in.
"It is absolutely no secret. It's all in a hard day's work. We just have to understand that the people voted us into parliament and they can as easily vote you out. Having said that, I feel that almost every day is a challenge for me. The happiest and most important day in my life when I was elected as a member of parliament. Because this way I can help and be the voice of the people I represent."
His message to the youth
Amunugama's message to the youth sums up what every religion from the dawn of history has impressed upon the people. His message is the central teaching of ethics and the many philosophies of the world. In four words he has summed up human civilization and society for the youth - Do good and be good.
Life out of Parliament
"I don't read books per say. But I read articles and newspapers. I travel most of the time so mostly listen to what's playing on the radio. And I have an affinity towards golden oldies.
Due to time constraints I hardly have time to watch anything unless I watch it on the go. So movies are a no! I like to play cricket and I watch the occasional rugger match whenever time permits.
I am in a relationship and that happened through a mutual friend. When it comes to dating girls during my time I don't think we did anything out of the box. It was always out and about in a group."
If you were able to live your life all over again and be anyone you want, who would that be and what would you do differently?
"I would want to be me"
Wish for the world
Amunugama is a complete man. No doubt it was the trait of compassion that has given him the courage to believe and the strength to enter parliament.
"World peace is most important, but to achieve that we have to first establish peace in the country we live in. My greatest strength is, as I see in me is compassion. This is what I first notice in a person as well and I am very religious. Anything to do with compassion moves me. Without compassion you are just half a man."
Formula
Amunugama's signature mark is that he is an extremely uncomplicated young man. A man who keeps things perfectly simple, his attitude in life must be admired.
"I don't think anyone needs a reason to be happy. Basically if you are content with your life you can be happy. Life is not complicated. If you understand that, then you are a happy man! Like I said before do good and be good."
Role model
The fact that Amunugama didn't have to elaborate on this, will come as no surprise to anyone. This leader left a lasting legacy and still looms large in the imagination of the masses.
"Just one person. It is Mahinda Rajapaksa and I don't think I have to elaborate."
Did you also undergo military discipline?
"Well yes, when my father came home which was not a thing that happened frequently because there was a war going on."
