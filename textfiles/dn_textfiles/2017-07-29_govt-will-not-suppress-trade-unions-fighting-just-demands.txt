'Govt. will not suppress trade unions fighting for just demands'

Today the country's people say that they feel that there is a government in the country in the aftermath of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation Trade Union strike, said Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera.
He added that people felt that there is a government in power after taking into account the way the Government faced the CPC employees strike effectively. He said so, speaking at a ceremony held at the NARA Institute on Thursday
Amaraweera added that the government would never suppress trade unions or employees fighting for just demands. “We are prepared to give an ear to the just demands of trade unions," he added.
He said that the government will not allow attempts of certain elements who are attempting to overthrow the government under the pretext of Trade Union action.
“The government could only be overthrown by an election, but not by a coup. No force is allowed to topple this government which came into power through the democratic process, he said.
