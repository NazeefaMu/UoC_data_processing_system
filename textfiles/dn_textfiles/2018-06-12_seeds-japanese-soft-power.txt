The Seeds of Japanese Soft Power

He goes by Peter though it’s not the name on his identity card, and he has no left arm. He lost it seven years ago while Chena farming near a swamp, when a crocodile took a bite. He also lost his job as a Chena farmer.
Chena farming—the practice of clearing virgin forest area, setting it on fire, and cultivating it immediately after—is arduous, back-breaking labour which pays a menial wage. Still, until his fateful encounter with the crocodile, Peter went to work every day for over thirty years with no complaints.
“I was so poor. My life was not good. But I have a family to feed,” he says. “Not working was not an option.”
After he lost his arm, though, there were no options left. Peter could no longer Chena farm. And so he spent the next few years unemployed, hungry and desolate, each day wondering where he’d get his next few rupees.
Now, in a twist of fate, Peter is gainfully self-employed as a passion fruit farmer in the Hambantota district. And to the surprise of many, he says losing his arm was the best thing that could have happened to him.
“You think I’m crazy. I see your face. But if I didn’t lose my arm, I might have never met the Japanese. And the Japanese, well, they saved my life.”
Upon recovering from his accident—as much as someone accustomed to life with two arms can recover with only one—Peter sought out the Department of Agriculture, hoping someone there could help him get back on his feet. Representatives from the department put him in touch with JICA, the Japanese International Cooperation Agency, which hosts an array of aid programmes in the region.
After a thorough screening process, JICA determined that Peter was a good candidate for its agricultural subsidy programme, and through the Department of Agriculture provided him not just with seedlings but with technical training. Now, in the backyard of his home, he has an entire field of passion fruit growing, which he sells to markets and retailers across the country. And rather than wonder where his next rupee or meal will come from, he feels, for the first time in his life, comfortable.
“I am self-sufficient,” Peter says. “I have free time to play with my grandchildren and to be engaged in volunteer work. I always had a liking to help people, but before, the only person I could worry about helping was me.”
“I'm so happy now. Not just with JICA, but with myself and what I am doing at the moment. My life is good.”
Two East Asian countries in search of regional influence
In the international forum, much media space has been dedicated to the complex and reliant relationship between Sri Lanka and China. A recent New York Times article published last month, titled, “What the World’s Emptiest International Airport Says About China’s Influence,” by Brook Larmer, explored this relationship by focusing on the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport in Hambantota, built and financed by the Chinese.
And yet, while that bilateral relationship is interesting — and, with the development of the Colombo Port City by the Chinese, ever more consequential — there’s another east Asian country seeking its own foothold in the Indian Ocean with whom Sri Lanka’s bilateral relationship is often overlooked: Japan.
On the surface, the manners in which China and Japan have sought to widen their spheres of influence here have been vastly different. China has invested heavily in infrastructure in Sri Lanka — partially or fully funding the construction of not just the Mattala Airport and Colombo Port City, but the extension of the Southern Expressway to Hambantota and the city’s deepwater port.
These developments are for the most part what Larmer of the New York Times calls “white elephants,” or possessions that are useless or troublesome, especially those that are expensive to maintain or difficult to dispose of. He draws upon the Mattala Airport, which was designed to handle a million passengers per year but currently receives only a dozen passengers per day, to argue that such white elephant projects are “not driven by local economic needs, but by remote stratagems.”
According to Larmer, these infrastructural investments by China in Sri Lanka are all part of the country’s ambitious goal to create a “modern-day Silk Road... with all paths leading to China.” The infrastructure is built, of course, with the expectation that China would be paid back — and if the debt could not be paid back, then, that it would be written off by giving China equity, often a majority stake, in the infrastructure project. This is precisely what has happened with the deep water Port in Hambantota — which China now controls 70% of for the next 99 years.
A different kind of power 
Japan, on the other hand, has taken a, well, softer route. Investing heavily in cooperation and aid programmes, Japan’s influence in Sri Lanka is not as bound by financial obligations as it is by emotional appeal.
Japan, through JICA, provides six main types of assistance to Sri Lanka: technical cooperation, ODA (official development assistance) loans, grant aid, disaster relief, research, and cooperation through citizen participation.
Only loan aid is required to be paid back. These six forms of assistance supposedly all work toward the three priority areas for cooperation which Japan has outlined for the country: infrastructure for development and economic growth, social and economic improvement in rural areas, and social infrastructure to mitigate vulnerabilities.
The seedling subsidy programme through the Department of Agriculture, which Peter was a beneficiary of and says saved his life, falls under the umbrella of social and economic improvement in rural areas. It’s a form of both grant aid and technical cooperation — as, since the year 2012, three Japanese agricultural experts have been living in Sri Lanka, visiting remote villages every day and working closely with communities to improve livelihoods through agricultural production.
Other programmes the Japanese have either funded or coordinated include demining efforts in the North, which the HALO Trust has said allowed for the demining of nearly 2,000 mines and other explosives in 2017 alone; the statistical eradication of child labour in Ratnapura, according to the International Labour Organization; and the provision of a long-awaited Doppler Weather Radar Network to Sri Lanka, which will allow the country to more accurately anticipate and prepare for deadly monsoons or droughts.
Like China, Japan too has invested in Sri Lankan infrastructure with loans that must be paid back. And yet the infrastructure projects it has chosen to fund are anything but “white elephants.”
Through the Sri Lankan Port Authority, Japan financed the construction of the Jaya Container Terminals 1, 2, 3, and 4, allowing the terminals to modernize their potential, an improvement that catalysed the rapid development and expansion of the port services.
Through the Road Development Authority, Japan financed the construction of 65 kilometres of the Southern Expressway, the sections between Kurundugahahetekma and Kokmaduwa.
Finally, also through the Road Development Authority, the Japanese are in the midst of financing the new bridge construction project over the Kelani River.
Which brings us to the present situation: two east Asian countries asserting their power here in very different ways—one by constraining Sri Lanka monetarily and the other by currying favour, through aid programmes and necessary infrastructure, in the eyes of everyday Sri Lankans.
Geeth Sameera, an agricultural instructor with the Department of Agriculture in Hambantota—a region that has seen so much Chinese influence but has barely benefited from it—put it this way.
“Right now, China has our wallets, OK? But thanks to agricultural programmes JICA has funded, Japan has our hearts.”
Perhaps Japan, in this, is playing a long game—hoping that aid and assistance, rather than debts owed and infrastructure owned, will allow them to benefit from Sri Lanka’s all-important location in the end. That soft power will get the country further than hard power. As with most things, only time will tell.
