Nose hair extensions

It may not be for all, but what is beauty really?
Nose hair extensions are the latest beauty trend taking the internet by storm. Instagram user @gret_chen_chen is the creator of the unusual accessory. They are made up of false eye lashes that are stuck around the rim of each nostril to get the effect of hair growing out of the nose. White it may not be an everyday wear; it is a form of artistic expression.
The trend is catching on and gaining a lot of attention. As you would expect not everyone is a fan and some are even grossed out by the idea, but others seem to be keen on giving it a try.
