On the road to democracy

 
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan visits Sri Lanka at a time when Pakistan has emerged from out of the dark clouds that once encircled it. From 2004 onwards Pakistan faced attack from Taliban forces. Militants ruled the tribal regions, seized Dir and Swat, and threatened the writ of the state across Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. The invasions were by militant units big enough to assault military outposts. It was only by mid 2011 that Pakistan was able to secure itself against Taliban. But serious violence continued until the Peshawar School attack that killed over 150 persons most of whom were children and Jinnah International Terminal of Karachi Airport, which resulted in the killing of 28 airport security personnel in 2014.
When I visited Pakistan three years ago in 2012, to Karachi to attend a conference at the university there, the sense of a fragile society continued to exist. The foreigners taking part in the conference were advised not to leave the campus premises on their own. However, even during that difficult period, the academic community in Pakistan was prepared to discuss the concept of federal government along with politicians and share it with their students.
One of the issues discussed was the transfer of powers from the central government to the provincial governments. The pride of Pakistan at that time was the 18th Amendment to the Pakistan constitution which was passed into law in 2010. This amendment reduced the powers of the presidency, including the President's power to dissolve Parliament unilaterally. This was like Sri Lanka's own 19th Amendment that came five years later in 2015 under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena and which reduced the powers of the presidency.
18th Amendment
Senator Mian Raza Rabbani who is considered as the architect of the 18th Amendment addressed the conference in his capacity as chief guest and said, "We can learn and understand various concepts. We looked at several constitutions of countries with a federal system including Switzerland, Germany and Canada when drafting the 18th Amendment. But at the end of the day it came down to home-grown solutions." Senator Rabbani said the amendment had given rise to federalism in Pakistan. "Seventeen ministries have been devolved. After 1947 it is perhaps the biggest structural change in our governmental machinery. It is not a perfect document - it has its ups and downs."
Other changes made by the 18th Amendment in Pakistan, were that courts would no longer endorse suspensions of the constitution, a judicial commission would appoint judges, and the president would no longer be able to appoint the head of the Election Commission. It is therefore ironic that the 18th Amendment in Sri Lanka, which was also passed in 2010 by the former government headed by President Mahinda Rajapaksa and which centralized powers in the presidency was very much the reverse of the 18th Amendment in Pakistan.
Democratic governance
As a country that continues to battle terrorism that comes from beyond its borders as well as within the country, Pakistan has more reason than Sri Lanka to fear the weakening of its central government. But the more enlightened political leaders of Pakistan realized that the powers of government are meant to be shared at the level of the provinces and not centralised and that it is the legitimacy that accompanies the system of shared governance that will best keep Pakistan together.
When I visited Karachi again in December last year, the security situation was much better than when I visited in 2012. This time I was able to visit the city without a sense of insecurity. I had a university student accompany me. But this was as a translator and guide. Walking the streets of Karachi was not too dissimilar to being in any big Indian city. I could not speak the language but felt at home in a similar cultural milieu especially in the bazaars and shops. I experienced the cordiality that Pakistanis, and indeed most South Asians, feel for Sri Lankans. Whenever I said I was from Sri Lanka, I felt more warmly treated. In the university I found an interest in Sri Lanka's transition process, both from war to peace, and from authoritarian to democratic governance.
Like Sri Lanka, Pakistan too has a democratically elected government where the former government handed over power to the new one in 2013 after a tightly contested election in which the elections were still fair enough for change to happen. But unlike Sri Lanka this democratically elected government has to share power with the military.
This was evident even within the University of Karachi premises. Units of the Pakistan army rangers, who are responsible for law and order in Karachi, are housed within the university campus in the hostels. The students have to find their housing outside of the university, while the army is inside.
However, credit for Karachi's improved security situation is given to the Pakistan army rangers. The fact that the army is not governing the country directly, and is ensuring security, has improved the military's image amongst the people.
Those in government are the ones who have to make political compromises and take decisions that benefit some at the expense of others. Where there is poverty and scarcity of resources those who are in government will tend to become unpopular. This applied to the army when it directly ruled the country.
There was a confidence in those I met that Pakistan is too strong a state to fall to ISIS or Taliban or any party with an extremist ideology. The system of public administration and democracy left by the departing British colonial power is very strong in all of the South Asian countries, including Sri Lanka that the British once governed.
The Pakistani elite, and also its military, are strongly networked with the Western-led international community. This is also the international community that Sri Lanka has rejoined after the change of government.
Economic projects
The visit of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to Sri Lanka comes at a time when Pakistan's relations with India show signs of improving. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's goodwill visit to Pakistan last week to meet with Prime Minister Sharif was symbolic of the acceptance by both countries that they need to improve their relations. Both are democracies, both have a common South Asian ethos, and both have vast numbers of poor people whose lives could be transformed if all the money that is spent on weaponry against each other is devoted to improve the lives of the masses. Both of these countries have warm ties with Sri Lanka.
While they improve their own relations with each other, and are willing to give their people visas to visit each country more freely, Sri Lanka can offer its services as a venue for meetings, conferences, people-to-people exchanges and, hopefully also, joint economic projects that can benefit the masses of people.
