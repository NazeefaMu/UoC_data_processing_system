BBS urges people to remain calm

The Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) has urged all Sri Lankans to remain calm and peaceful following the Digana incident saying that any more violence at this stage would lead to anarchy in the country.
BBS General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday said at a time when the government is unstable , this kind of incident can lead to a dangerous situation. There are elements who are trying to gain political advantages out this situation and that should not be allowed.
The Prime Minister who is also the Law and Order Minister and the Police should be held responsibility for this incident. If the Police Spokesman announced at the beginning that the youth who assaulted the lorry driver have been taken into the custody, the people in the area would have not been provoked in this manner.
“We do not condone this incident and the violence and the provocative acts will not lead to solutions. The victim is a kind individual who have won the hearts of all communities,” Ven.Gnanasara Thera said. “The victim’s mother is a paralysed while the father is a diabetic. One of his children is also sick. Now we should look how we can help this family.
We urge the powers that be to come to one table and work for a solution. We should begin an intellectual discourse on this issue with the participation of the Muslim and Sinhala politicians, academics and intellectuals,” the BBS General Secretary said. He further said that most of these problems are a result of the instigation of people with vested interests. But,the blame is only put on the Sinhala Buddhist community. We must carefully study this situation,” Ven.Gnanasara Thera added.
