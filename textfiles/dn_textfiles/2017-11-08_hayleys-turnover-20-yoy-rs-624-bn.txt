Hayleys turnover up by 20% YOY to Rs. 62.4 bn

Hayleys PLC posted a 20% Year-on-Year (YoY) increase in turnover up to Rs. 62.4billion.
The Group has continuously infused higher levels of investment into key business segments with a view to enhancing growth potential over the medium-long term. These investments were also reflected in the Group’s net finance cost, which rose to Rs. 1.9 billion while group profit before tax for the period stood at Rs. 1.4 billion in 1HFY17/18.
In that context, Hayleys Group achieved significant benchmarks during the period in review, particularly in relation to its recent acquisition of a 61.73% of the issued share capital of Singer ( Sri Lanka) PLC for a consideration of LKR 10.9 billion, making it the single largest acquisition for a listed company in Sri Lanka in recent times. Commenting on the Group’s performance over the first half, Hayleys PLC Chairman and Chief Executive, Mohan Pandithage said: “The group was able to achieve several significant milestones during the first half of the financial year, driven by aggressive investments that have positioned Hayleys Group for strong top and bottom line growth moving forward.”
“We are confident that the acquisition of Singer (Sri Lanka) PLC together with the recent major investments that the Hayleys Group has made into leisure and transport and logistics sectors are anticipated to yield significantly improved results for the group in the future.”
Turnover in the group’s Transportation and Logistics segment rose from Rs. 11.1 billion up to Rs. 16.4 billion while operating profits rose from Rs. 631 million up to Rs. 1.1 billion during 1H17/18.
Strong export market prices supported notable improvements in the group’s Plantation sector which recorded turnover of Rs. 6.5 billion, as compared with a previous Rs. 4.4 billion.
Poor weather conditions hampered agricultural production, leading to a reduced turnover and operating profits, which ended the half at Rs. 5.5 billion, and Rs. 233 million respectively.
Increased raw material prices also negatively affected the group’s Hand Protection and Purification Products segments. Revenue in the Hand Protection segment stood at Rs. 8 billion while operating profits stood at Rs. 98 million.
Leisure sector operating profits reduced to Rs. 36 million despite relatively stable turnover of Rs. 2.6 billion, largely as a result of investments made towards the refurbishment of key hospitality properties within the group.
