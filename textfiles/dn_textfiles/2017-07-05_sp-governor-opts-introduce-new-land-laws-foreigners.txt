SP Governor opts to introduce new land laws for foreigners

Southern Province Governor Dr.Hemakumara Nanayakkara plans to introduce new measures to end the irregular and fraudulent land dealings of foreign investors using diverse awkward manoeuvres and to introduce a proper mechanism for the recovery of taxes from foreign investors carrying out numerous businesses, without paying taxes to the Provincial Council.
The Governor disclosed his plans presenting the policy statement of the Fourth Session of the seventh Southern Provincial Council at the Council Secretariat at Kalegana, Galle yesterday.
"I intend to provide opportunities to foreign investors who have referred their projects under the Sri Lanka Board of Investments when issuing lands for broadening investments. In this backdrop, the relevant steps should be taken immediately to avoid anomalous land acquisitions made by foreign investors by using different traits. Similarly, I would like to emphasise the necessity of measuring actions for preparing a proper methodology for recovering taxes from foreign investors involved in different businesses,evading paying taxes and the other taxes that are to be recovered from tourist industry and businesses,"Dr.Nanayakkara said.
The Governor who pointed out some statistics regarding economic performances of the Southern Province also expressed his reservations over the authenticity of some figures.
"The Southern Province has contributed 10.4% to the Gross Domestic Production of Sri Lanka which amounts to Rs.11,183,220 million.Hence,it is imperative to mention that the Southern Province's contribution to the Gross Domestic Production in plantation sector is higher than the value depicted in statistics," he observed.
In his policy statement, the Governor explained the policies and measures that would be implemented by the Provincial Council for the fulfillment of the development activities in 2017. He submitted a comprehensive Police statement covering all sectors of the provincial administration under the powers vested upon the Provincial Council by the 13th Amendment to the Constitution.
Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal De Silva proposed the vote of thanks which was seconded by Chief Opposition Whip Tennakoon Nilame.
