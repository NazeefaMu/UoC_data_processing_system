Flying over mountains

Traveling in a Hot Air Balloon is an incredible and amazing experience. This unique experience is unforgettable. It was a nature lovers dream! The Daily News took part in a novel hot air balloon ride launched at Cinnamon Lodge Habarana in partnership with Sunrise Ballooning
Cinnamon Lodge Habarana, part of Cinnamon Hotels & Resorts recently partnered with Sunrise Ballooning to offer its guests a novel outdoor experience - hot air balloon rides over the picturesque terrain of the Cultural Triangle.
There was a sense of pleasure as we passed over the terrain with the villagers waving at us. The sight of the sunrise was absolutely beautiful. Seeing the misty mountains was spectacular. The view certainly was mesmerizing with the lush greenery and the blue skies. It really gave one sense of peace.
Branded balloons bearing the iconic Cinnamon logo are being used for the activity, which have been designed specifically to offer guests a truly memorable adventure during their stay at the hotel.
The hot air balloon rides follow a scenic flight route and provide guests with the opportunity to gently float 1,000 - 2,000 feet over the forest, streams and paddy fields below. Taking off from Kandalama at sunrise, the balloon rides will take guests on an unforgettable journey that will enable them to experience the lush surroundings and rich historical landmarks of the area from a fresh, new perspective.
Indeed words are inadequate to describe such an extraordinary experience and full credit must go to Cinnamon Lodge Habarana and Sunrise Ballooning for such professional conduct. There was a sense of safety knowing we were traveling with professionals. What a relief!
All balloon rides are operated by a professional pilot and couples, solo travelers and small groups can all be accommodated on board. The balloons are registered with the Civil Aviation Authority of Sri Lanka and undergo regular safety audits to ensure that they in prime condition at all times.

Following their landing, guests will be treated to a glass of champagne, whilst juice and chilled water will also be available throughout the journey.
In the end all that can be said is that it was an experience that I would recommend to anyone. That is how fantastic it was. I felt like a bird in the skies!
