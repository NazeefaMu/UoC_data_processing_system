Flying advertising boards halt South African game

JOHANNESBURG, Sunday: There were flying advertising boards, a wonder goal, floodlight failure and a yellow card for teasing an opponent during the first round of the South African League Cup this weekend.
A sudden gust of wind sent one wooden board into the back of a goal net, two others on to the pitch, and blew over two dugouts during a match in Pretoria.
The wind, torrential rain and lightning forced the match to be temporarily halted before SuperSport United won 1-0 after extra time against Ajax Cape Town.
Zimbabwean Eric Chipeta deflected a close-range shot from Thuso Phala into his net to decide one of four ties that went to an additional 30 minutes.
Luvuyo Memela dribbled past opponents from the centre before beating Namibia goalkeeper Maximilian Mbaeva from inside the box to earn Orlando Pirates a 2-1 win over Golden Arrows.
In a game of great goals, Mpho Makola gave the Soweto Buccaneers an early lead and Wayde Jooste levelled from a superbly flighted second-half free-kick.
Kaizer Chiefs and Maritzburg United found themselves in the dark due to a power failure six minutes from the end of regular time at Soccer City, the 95,000-seat national football stadium in Soweto.
Neither team could manage a goal and Chiefs advanced 4-2 on penalties with the decisive spot-kick coming from debutant Keagan Buchanan. AFP
