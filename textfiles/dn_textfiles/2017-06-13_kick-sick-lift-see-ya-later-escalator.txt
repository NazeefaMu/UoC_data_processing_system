A kick for a sick lift: See ya later escalator!

My column last week dealt with my stark fear of lifts. Yes, I did concede that I have a considerable phobia of riding them. I also admitted I suffer from claustrophobia and am terrified for a number of reasons of stepping into an air-tight metal box the size of a luxury toilet cubicle, which is devoid of a loo when you become stuck and incontinent with downright fright and lose control of your bladder.
I agree that there may be no single invention that shaped the modern megapolis as much as the lift and has enabled cities to push continually skywards. Ok, I acknowledge they are a marvel of progress and are innovatively designed with safety features. But I still hate them. So I take steps to avoid them. I agree they are a convenient source of mobility when you consider the ups and downs of their use in high rises.
Sometimes, they are not on the up and up. Lifts, as one elfin designer friend so pithily described them, are like dress shirts, you can button up or button down. Yet a lift is one of the most uncomfortable places to be in. Essentially, you’re stuck in a tiny room, surrounded by strangers, with the air oozing of awkward silence.
The single most ruthlessly uncomfortable aspect of lift rides is that there is nowhere to escape. Bad breath, bad jokes, body odour and bad attitudes are all amplified in spaces where people are trapped with no means for relief until the car mercifully reaches their floor.
Personally speaking, having lived in concrete jungles comprising high-rises in countries such as Singapore and Hong Kong and the lifts to success have often been out of order. Yet, unless I have to travel in a stratospheric direction with the sky the limit, I am usually constrained to use the stairs ... one step at a time.
Fear impels me to adhere strictly to the signs on the stairways whether there is an emergency of an impending inferno or not: ‘In case of fire do not use lift.’ I take out my marker pen and mischievously scrawl a slight amendment under the sign: ‘USE WATER!’
Grand-daughter Moya 13, and seemingly going on 22, appears to be the brightest family spark in the cynical department. She posted a rebuttal to me on my last week’s column in which I mentioned: “As in the case of many others I am always impatient while waiting for a lift. I am a firm believer that many lifts work on the pressure you exert on the call button. So punching it a 100 times will make it arrive a lot faster.”
I quote a part of her scathing missive verbatim: “Darling Dada, Sarcasm and stupidity sometimes meet in a lift. If you press the lift button three times after it’s been already pressed do you really imagine it will go into hurry mode?” What cheek! I was seriously considering disowning the family brat despite her attractive hazel eyes and a peaches and cream complexion.
I fired back: “Yes Moya Baby, life is like a lift. On your way up or down you sometimes have to stop and let some people off. I am seriously considering the prospect of renouncing our relationship the same way.”
Sri Lankans refer to these contraptions as lifts as in the Brit equivalent while the Yanks call them escalators. I believe both names are problematic misnomers. Think about it. Both ‘lift’ and ‘elevator’ would seem to refer only to upward motion. The same goes for ‘ascending room’ and ‘escalator’. Would someone please enlighten me on what you call the darn thing when it is going down?
I do not vouch for the veracity of this story spun by an Indian journalistic colleague in Hong Kong named Rajaram. “Yevery day has its ups and downs,’ says Rajaram. He claims he entered a posh hotel and a bevy of attractive women was already inside. Rajaram says: “I mentioned my floor saying: “Ballroom please.” To which the lady standing in front of him replied: “I’m sorry, I didn’t realise I was crowding you.”
I suffered a traumatic experience in a Singapore condominium lift with two expatriate women and three school kids inside. Suddenly the darn contrivance came to a shuddering halt on the 6th floor and the lights flickered and went out. Terrified, I hit the emergency button and someone answered. I explained that we were stuck and queried: “So, do these things have an air supply?” The guy answered: “Erm. I think so.” Some consolation I thought as I answered him: “Yeah, me too mate.”
We all shared a laugh, but it was one of nervousness. I started to feel lightheaded and hot. We had been in for about two minutes. I began to worry about the oxygen supply, so I prised open the doors. Fresh air piled through the doors. I took a huge gulp of air, something I had rationed until this point. But now I was starting to get into full-blown panic mode although I resisted the urge to yell because of consideration for the three kids inside.
I suddenly realised that the most important thing to do when you’re in a stuck lift is to stay calm. I’ve seen people go from complete cool demeanour to raving insanity in such situations. Who am I kidding, I am that person. So do as I say and not as I do.
I glanced at the kids and they looked at me for guidance. The little boy slipped his hand into mine for reassurance. Suddenly I felt a calm enveloping me and I said with more hope than faith: “There is nothing to be scared of because I am Batman in disguise. And Batman doesn’t let his friends down. I’ll get us out of here soon.”
The kids smiled for the first time in those harrowing three minutes or so. I then asked them all to move back and in that confounded confined space charged the door and slammed it hard with my heel. To everyone’s astonishment the doors slid open, shut again and the lift began moving.
It was actually going down to the ground floor. It opened and the kids and the women rushed through not giving the lift a chance to trap us again. The maintenance crew was at hand to greet us. As we escaped the kids told them their services weren’t needed because Batman had rescued them.
The kids looked at me with worshipful eyes while thanking me for the help. So did the two ladies. I nodded my head in modest acceptance.
As I sauntered out of the lobby I simply addressed the lift while waxing poetic: “See ya later escalator. And thanks for saving me from being a public urinator!’’
