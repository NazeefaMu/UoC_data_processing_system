Warrant issued for the arrest of accused in Raviraj murder

The Court of Appeal yesterday issued a warrant ordering the arrest of the accused in the murder of Parliamentarian Nadarajah Raviraj, Lt. Prasad Chandana Kumara, also known as Sampath of the Sri Lanka Navy.
The Court of Appeal issued the warrant after the accused failed to appear in court when the appeal to the verdict given by the High Court was taken up yesterday.
The appeal was heard before Justice Deepali Wijesundara and Lalith Jayasuriya yesterday.
Former Parliamentarian Nadarajah Raviraj and his bodyguard were murdered on November 9, 2006 in Colombo.Six persons were accused and indictments were filed by the Attorney General. However, the case was heard in the absence of three men accused of the crime.
The trial was thereafter heard before a Special Jury on the request of the accused. The verdict of the Jury delivered in December 2016 acquitted all accused of the charges against them.
The wife of the slain MP filed the appeal challenging the findings of the Jury.
