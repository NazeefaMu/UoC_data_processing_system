Sri Lanka through travelers’ lens!

The Cinnamon Sri Lanka Photo Contest 2017 was launched last Monday at Cinnamon Grand Colombo in the presence of Minister of Tourism, John Amaratunge, John Keells Group Leisure Sector President Krishan Balendra, Sri Lanka Tourism Chairman Paddy Withane and Senior General Manager - Marketing, Mobitel (PVT) LTD Isuru Dissanayake.
Cinnamon Sri Lanka Photo Contest 2017 is a splendid platform for travelers, photographers and videography fans to capture Sri Lanka through their own lens. Contestants are invited to submit their best work to be judged by an independent panel of globally recognized judges. The Panel of Judges include Karl Taylor, Ami Vitale, Paul Goldstein, Chitral Jayatilake, Gehan De Silva Wijeyeratne and Dinesh Khanna.
“This initiative will enable those visiting our cities, national parks, beaches, heritage sites, towns and villages to portray Sri Lanka in their own perspective. This is a platform to celebrate the best photography and videography captured in Sri Lanka. The diversity of our island invokes spectacular visuals from vibrant landscape to ancient architecture and beyond. We are certain this endeavour will help to engage with the international travel community and raise Sri Lanak’s profile as a truly captivating travel destination,” said John Keells Group Leisure Sector President Krishan Balendra in his welcome address.
Tourism, Land and Christian Religious Affairs Minister John Amaratunge extended his heartfelt thanks to the organizers of the event for having initiated this mega photo contest.
“This is something very essential for Sri Lanaka. I wholeheartedly welcome this initiative and anxiously waiting to see the finals,” he added.
The winner will receive the title of ‘Cinnamon Photographer of the Year’ along with a cash prize of USD 5000, international media exposure, a six-page spread in the Cinnamon Magazine and an all-expense paid, 21-day tour of Sri Lanka. The best videographer will also receive a cash prize of USD 2,500 along with an all-expense paid, 10-day tour of the island.
Additionally, a cash prize of USD 500 will be given to the winners of each individual category.
