Patients suffer vision loss after injection

At least 12 patients who sought recently treatment from the Nuwara Eliya hospital for eye-related conditions have complained they had experienced partial vision loss, following the administering of a drug via an injection.
Hospital sources said some patients had complained of complete vision loss following treatment.
Nuwara Eliya General Hospital Director Dr. Aruna Jayasekara said that he had been informed of some complications suffered by several patients and they were currently under treatment.
According to hospital sources, 55 patients had been treated with the same injection and 12 patients had developed complications, following treatment.
Dr. Jayasekera said following treatment, some of the affected patients were already showing improvement in their conditions.
He said samples of the drug from the batch in question have been sent to the drug-testing unit at the Health Ministry for investigations.
