Silent honour

Cricket almost brings things to a standstill in his life. Sri Lankan cricketer Jeevan Mendis got nothing without labour. Sweat, strive, struggle were an inseparable part of his cricket chores. The Test spot, batting slot, recognition, all had to be earned. An all-rounder who bowls leg spin, Mendis has represented Sri Lanka in One Day Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals, including the 2012 World Twenty20 and 2015 World Cup. He played for Derbyshire recently this year. Vanessa Mendis née Wood gives us an insight to the man behind the bat and ball.
The cricketer
Jeevan was popular as a batsman during his school days at S. Thomas’ College, Mount Lavinia. His talent for bowling emerged only after he joined the national team. He is a left-handed batsman and a right arm leg spinner.
Jeevan is into arts as well but since he chose to follow cricket, he could not prolong in other sectors. He got the opportunity to pursue higher studies at Kelaniya University but selected cricket over that. I was around 17 years old then and I did not realize how important education was but now when I ponder over the matter, I think he should have done both together.
The meeting
I met Jeevan when he was playing for one of the Royal-Thomian matches in 2002. He was popular as a school boy cricketer at that time. I was studying at Methodist College, Colombo and went to watch the match because my brother, Aundray and my cousin were both Thomians. I went because it was a thrill to watch a Royal-Thomian match. It was pretty much a customary affair because we go to watch every year.
Jeevan had seen me on the grounds and had inquired who I am. My cousin passed the messages across to me. I was in my G C E O/L classes. I was not interested in anything except studies. I was a bookworm and meeting and talking with a boy seemed like a scary experience for me. However we became friends first before getting into a relationship.
We chatted on the phone regularly and my aunty (father’s sister) was very supportive. I used to go to her house during the holidays and meet Jeevan. My mother was very strict and would be angry even if I hung on the phone too much. My father was cool and he allowed me to go out with Jeevan once he got to know about us. However the rule was that my brother had to accompany us everywhere.
We went out for dinner with some of my cousins. We had burgers in the car. That was our first date. Once my parents got used to Jeevan they allowed me to go on trips with him as well.
The marriage
We went out for seven years before tying the knot. Time made me realize that Jeevan is the one for me because we both understand each other very well. I did commerce for my G C E As and Jeevan followed the arts stream. We both did economics as a subject. He used to help me do my projects for my G C E As.
I believe that he proposed to me a couple of weeks after meeting me! Jeevan is a quiet person by nature. He would not do elaborate things to amuse anyone. I am the one who loves affection. Jeevan keeps his feelings bottled up. He conveys his feelings through facial expressions and behaviour. I have learnt to read what he wants through such gestures now. We communicate like that most of the time.
Jeevan introduced me to his mother eventually. We used to go there to play and ride bicycles. Then I hung out there and had dinner with them as well. His family was pretty cool about it. We got married in December, 2008. I was 21 then and Jeevan was 25. We got married in church and held the reception at Mount Lavinia Hotel.
Baby boon
Jeevan and I wanted a son the first time I learnt that I was expecting. Jayden was born in October, 2010. He was our lucky charm because Jeevan got a call informing that he has been selected for the national cricket team on the day he was born.
Joshua was born in 2013. He is Jeevan’s pet. Joel was born in 2015. We named our sons with names starting with the letter “J” because that is the first letter in Jeevan’s name. Later we realized that Jeevan’s father and grandfather both are J Mendises!
The father
Jeevan is very family oriented. If he is not playing cricket he is always with us. He would even get us to accompany him to the store. He plays, washes and feeds the children. The boys too are very attached to him. Jayden was a good, trouble-free baby but the other two are rather naughty.
It is too early to tell if the boys are into cricket. They play with anything. However Jayden is very proud of his father. He likes to tell people that he is so and so.
Similar and diverse interests
I love reading but Jeevan is not into books. He likes to watch movies but I am no movie buff. I love travelling. Jeevan used to hate travelling but I get him to travel now.
Both of us like entertainment and company. We move around mostly with Jeevan’s school friends.
Travelling
We used to travel as a family those days but now, since Jayden is schooling it is difficult to follow up.
However we always try our best to stay together. We get to travel mostly during the school holidays. Nuwara Eliya is out favourite travel destination in Sri Lanka. We love the countryside in England too. We travel at least once or twice a month. We travel to Galle often and spend the night at a hotel.
Happiest and saddest moments in life
One of the happiest moments in Jeevan’s life is the day Jayden was born because it was a cause for a double celebration. He is also very much into his religion. Accepting God as his saviour are special moments in life for him.
During the 2015 World Cup Jeevan was injured while warming up for the second match. He had to give the tournament a miss after that and that was a real blow for him.
Foodwise
Jeevan is a fan of Sri Lankan food. He loves dry fish, coconut sambol and meat curries. I cook once in a while because we have help. It is difficult to please Jeevan - foodwise. He even looks at the colour of the dish and if it does not please him, he will not consume it. He likes the chicken salads I whip up. Jayden likes his rice and curry but the other two are junk food lovers.
Most touching gesture
I was diagnosed with pancreatitis a couple of years ago. I was hospitalized for three weeks and our youngest was one and a half months then. Jeevan handled the boys wonderfully. He handled everything from taking the baby for his two month vaccine to taking care of the kids.
Most embarrassing moment
Jeevan did the Gangnam Style dance during the ICC T20 World Cup 2012 in Pallakele. I was so shocked when I hear that because though I was there, I did not see him dancing. I never expected him to do such a thing because he is such a reserved and quiet person.
An alternative profession for Jeevan
I think Jeevan would have continued his studies. He himself says that he would have been an interior designer. Though our house is designed by an architect, the furnishings and décor are Jeevan’s ideas.
