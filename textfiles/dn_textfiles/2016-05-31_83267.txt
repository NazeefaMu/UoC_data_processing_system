Cook looks ahead after breaking 10,000 barrier

Chester-le-Street, Monday: England captain Alastair Cook was already looking ahead after becoming the youngest batsman to score 10,000 Test runs during the course of his side’s series-clinching win over Sri Lanka at the Riverside on Monday.
Cook, who started the day needing five more runs to bring up his 10,000, reached the landmark when he clipped Nuwan Pradeep for four through mid-wicket.
That left-handed opener finished on 47 not out as England won the second Test with more than a day to spare, a victory that put them 2-0 up in the three-match series.
Cook is the first England batsman to score 10,000 Test runs and at 31 years and 157 days old, the youngest from any country, beating the previous record of India great Sachin Tendulkar (31 years and 326 days).
“It’s a very special moment for me, but the game is not about personal milestones, it’s about winning games and scoring runs to do that,” said Cook. AFP
