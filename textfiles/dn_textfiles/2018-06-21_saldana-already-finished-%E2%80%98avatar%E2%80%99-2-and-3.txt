Actor Zoe Saldana is through the filming of James Cameron’s ‘Avatar’ 2 and 3. The 39-year-old actor, who reprises her role as Neytiri in the follow-ups to the 2009 blockbuster hit, wrapped filming on June 8, according to a report.
Jon Landau, who is co-producing with director James Cameron, made the revelation at a Fox presentation.

He also said that the sequels will feature “never before seen parts of Pandora”. Cameron, who was also present at the event, added that the early results on the films “are beyond even our expectations”.
Besides Saldana, Sam Worthington, Sigourney Weaver and Stephen Lang will also return. Kate Winslet, Cliff Curtis and Oona Chaplin are among the new cast members.
