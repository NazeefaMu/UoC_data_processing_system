Warrant issued  on 16 petroleum workers

Colombo Additional Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake yesterday issued warrants for the arrest of 16 petroleum corporation workers for their failure to appear before courts over their alleged offensive behaviour during petroleum trade unions’ strike on July 26.
The 16 petroleum workers who were arrested for blocking off the distribution of fuel at the Kolonnawa petroleum storage terminal were later ordered to be released on police bail.
They had been ordered to appear before court yesterday, but neither the suspects nor the lawyers on behalf them appeared in courts.
Taking into consideration the facts, the Additional Magistrate issued warrants for the arrest of 16 suspects.
