Hundred-acre orchard for TEJC mangoes

Under the instructions of Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, a 100-acre plot of land had been set aside to grow the newly-introduced TEJC mango variety, recently.
Seven thousand plants had been distributed among farmers for the endeavour and the mangoes grown would be sold to the private sector to be exported.
