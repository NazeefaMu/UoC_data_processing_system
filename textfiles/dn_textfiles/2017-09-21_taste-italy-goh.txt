Taste of Italy at GOH

Grand Oriental Hotel will be hosting a special Italian Food Festival featuring the very best Italian Cuisine has to offer. There will be a selection of food items that will be absolutely scrumptious. Daily News spoke to GOH on this evening of gastronomic delight.
“We have a Master Chef who specializes in Italian Food. This Italian Food Festival will be from September 29 – October 1 and will be a dinner event at the Harbour Room. This is a family event. There will be entertainment for the whole family with beverage promotions. We have live action stations with pasta. Since October 1 is World Children’s Day, we have organized a magic show for the children and throughout the event children below 12 can come in free. So on the 1st we are inviting more kids to come and we plan to gift them with balloons and chocolates and other such gifts,” said General Manager, Grand Oriental Hotel, Lalin Adhikari.
“The ambience of the event will be Italian. There will be a variety of promotions put together, so guests can enjoy. Even Pasta which will be a variety of pasta and sauces put together will be prepared in front of the guests,” he added.
When GOH planned the Italian Festival, they found that it coincided with the World Children’s Day. So the management thought of coupling both events up. “As this is a family event the idea seemed to be brilliant. This Italian Food Festival of course is being held for the second time. The crowd turnout was very satisfactory first time. It was obvious to the GOH management that Sri Lankans are quite keen on Italian dishes. We are also planning on getting some celebrities for the first day,” Adhikari added.
The evening will start at 7.30 pm and it will go on till 11.30 – 12.00am. There is 10 per cent off for particular credit cards (HSBC, BOC and NDB). There will be soft drinks such as EGB, wines and hard liquor on buy one and get one free basis.
Chef Roshan Jayawickrama who is the mastermind behind the event is a very experienced and talented Chef with international experience in Europe, Bahrain and Dubai. He was a Chef at Il Ponte and has six to seven years of experience in the Italian sphere.
“This event will be on an Italian theme featuring its cuisine with an Italian atmosphere. We have a variation of six to eight types of Pastas and eight variety of sauces. All this will be prepared with the fresh herbs that you can find in Italy along with cheese. We are importing a variety of cheese from Italy for the event,” said Jayawickrama.
“The event will totally highlight Italian culture with the salads, cheese varieties and meats (lamb, turkey, Pork and Chicken) that are famous in Italy. There will be a variety of Pizzas as well,” he added.
“Italian food has a long history of 2000 years, with a Roman style of cooking. They always cook with fresh herbs and no artificial things are put in. It is fresh, hygienic and nourishing. The Italian Food Festival features food from all parts of Italy. Italian food always goes with wines, cheese and fresh herbs,” Jayawickrama explained. Grand Oriental Hotel in the recent past hosted the Jaffna Food Festival which featured local products.
