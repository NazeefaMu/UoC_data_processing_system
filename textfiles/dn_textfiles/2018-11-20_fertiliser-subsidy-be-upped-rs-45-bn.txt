Fertiliser subsidy to be upped to Rs. 45 bn

The expenditure incurred by the government on the fertiliser subsidy is expected to increase to Rs. 45 billion during the 2018/19 season since paddy lands coming under the plough will increase to more than 800,000 hectares, following the increased rainfall experienced recently, the Agriculture Ministry said in a statement.
The statement said 500,000 hectares were cultivated with paddy during the last Yala season. As all tanks and reservoirs have been filled up to 80 percent of their capacity following the recent rains, more than 850,000 hectares were being prepared for paddy cultivation this season.
Last season, 14,000 hectares of paddy land was left fallow due to irrigation and other problems. But all these lands were also been asweddumised following requests made by the Agrarian Services Department. The cultivation of subsidiary food crops such as sorghum, undu, soya beans and vegetables too in expected to increase considerably this season resulting in increased fertiliser use.
Another factor for increased fertilizer use was the reduction of fertilizer prices by Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa.
A bundle of urea used for paddy fertiliser has been reduced to Rs. 500, a bundle of urea for subsidiary food crops has been reduced from Rs. 1,500 to Rs. 1,000, and the price of a bundle of fertilizer mixture has been reduced to Rs. 1,100.
Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amraweera has promised to continue the fertilizer subsidy without interruption and offer all possible incentives to the farmer population.
