Bread up by Rs.5

The price of a 450 gm loaf of bread was increased by Rs 5 with effect from midnight yesterday.
President of the All Island Bakery Owners’ Association N.K. Jayawardana said that many issues and reasons resulted in the increase in the price of a loaf of bread, not just the increase in the price of wheat flour.
He cited the changes in taxes, the decrease in the value of the rupee, increase in the price of flour and increase in the salary of administrative staff as their reasons for increasing the price of a loaf of bread.
“If the reason to increase the price of a loaf of bread was due to the increase in the price of flour, only Rs 1.50 should have been increased. But the association decided to increase the price of a loaf of bread by Rs 5 considering the above mentioned reasons”, he said.
Jayawardana said that he had written to the Ministry of Finance to provide them tax concessions and added that they received no reply.
