RISING FROM THE ASHES

A house at 6th Lane Joolwewa, Andarawewa in Sooriyawwa belonging to P. G. W. Vasantha was destroyed in a fire on March 26 night when the inmates were away. Although the neighbours who spotted the fire had rallied to douse it, most of the belongings in the house was burnt by the time they managed to put it out. Here, two dejected school going children of the affected family sifting through the debris to collect whatever schoolbooks and notes spared by the fire. Pictures by Nuwan Jayasekara in Suriyawewa
