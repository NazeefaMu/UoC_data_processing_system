Isipathana threaten pull out over venue

The Milo President’s Trophy schools knockout rugby final between Isipathana College and Royal College was in the balance after Isipathana had requested for a venue change from the Sri Lanka Schools Rugby Football Association (SLSRFA).
Isipathana fired a letter addressed to the secretary of SLSRFA yesterday requesting a change in venue for the final that is to be played on July 9. The letter was tabled at a meeting of the SLSRFA yesterday and Denzil Darling the SLSRFA Secretary said, “Yes we have received the letter from Isipathana to change the venue of the final from Royal Sports Complex due to the unfair advantage their opponents Royal will have since it’s their home grounds. But after a long discussion the SLSRFA committee decided not to change the venue as it will be unfair to S.Thomas’ College ML who played their semi-final against Royal at the Royal Sports Complex on Sunday after making a protest for a change of venue.
“We have invited the Isipathana rugby committee to come for a meeting on Wednesday to see how we can go forward from here,” Darling said.
An Isipathana rugby committee media spokesman told the Daily News: “We have clearly informed our dislike to play this final at Royal Sports Complex since its Royal’s home ground and they have an unfair advantage. If the SLSRFA decides to go forward and play at the Royal Sports Complex, then we have no option but to pull out of Saturday’s final.”
