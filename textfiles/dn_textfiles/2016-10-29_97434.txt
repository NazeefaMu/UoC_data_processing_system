Mennie gets surprise call-up to Australia Test squad

Australia’s first Test squad has been revealed, with selectors handing a surprise call-up to South Australian fast-bowler Joe Mennie. Chairman of selectors Rod Marsh named a 12-man squad on Friday, with the key decisions being the retention of Shaun Marsh at the top of the order and the selection of Mennie.
The South Australian seamer, who was the Sheffield Shield’s top wicket-taker last season (51 wickets at 21.21 runs apiece), is one of four quicks in the group, alongside Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Peter Siddle.
Mennie’s selection comes at the cost of Jackson Bird, who was a part of the squad in Sri Lanka in August. Marsh revealed that Mennie’s ability with the bat was a factor in his selection over Bird.
“(Bird) came very close. Thing that cost him a place was his batting,” Marsh said. “We’ve got to get runs at the bottom of the order as well”
Mennie averages 18.50 in first-class cricket, with five half-centuries to his name. By comparison, Bird averages 8.97 and has a top score of 32.
Squad:
Steve Smith (capt), David Warner, Josh Hazlewood, Usman Khawaja, Nathan Lyon, Mitchell Marsh, Shaun Marsh, Joe Mennie, Peter Nevill, Peter Siddle, Mitchell Starc, Adam Voges
