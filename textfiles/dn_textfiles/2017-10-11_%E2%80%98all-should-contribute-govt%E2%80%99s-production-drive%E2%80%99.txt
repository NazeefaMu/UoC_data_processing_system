‘All should contribute to Govt.’s production drive’

Public Administration and Management Ministry Secretary J.J.Rathnasiri said yesterday that all Sri Lankans have a responsibility and obligation to increase food production and achieving self sufficiency in the country.
“We all have felt the effects of the loss in food production caused by the recent drought and floods,” he said. “The impact of disasters on agriculture and food safety is severe,” Rathnasiri said.”Since disasters cannot be avoided, we must act to increase local food production by minimising the negative effects on livelihoods and the economy,” he said. “We have to be prepared from now to face such a situation in the future. That is why the National Food Production Battle was launched under the guidance of President Maithripala Sirisena, aiming to revive and strengthen the agricultural sector in a sustainable manner amid the challenges posed by climate changes,” he added.
Addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, Rathnasiri said National Food Production Week was declared from October 6 to 12.
Accordingly, October 11 has been designated as public servants day and the inauguration ceremony in this regard will be held at the Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council Auditorium and Ratnapura District Secretariat.
Each of the 1.5 million public servants in the country will have to plant two trees on October 11. Meanwhile, the government has also requested all government servants to start home gardens at all public institutions and government quarters.
“Field officers like Samurdhi Development Officers, Grama Niladharis, and development officers have asked to start home gardens at their premises. This will lead all villagers to create home gardens in their premises,” he added.
He further said a number of public awareness programmes will be implemented on national food production, toxins free food production and prevention of food wastage while several review meetings will also be held to analyze the progress of the entire programme.
Programmes for Public Servants Day will be implemented jointly by Public Administration and Management Ministry, Home Affairs Ministry and Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry.
Home Affairs Ministry Secretary Neil de Alwis and Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry Additional Secretary Sujan Nanayakkara were also spoke.
