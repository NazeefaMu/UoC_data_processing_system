Lalith and Anusha’s appeals against conviction fixed for inquiry

Two Appeal petitions filed by former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunge and former Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) Director General Anusha Palpita challenging the judgement of the Colombo High Court were yesterday fixed for argument on November 26 by the Court of Appeal.
Lalith Weeratunga and Anusha Palpita had been sentenced to three-years-Rigorous Imprisonment by the Colombo High Court for misappropriating Rs.600 million of funds belonging to TRC. When the two appeal petitions came up before Court of Appeal Justice Deepali Wijesundara and Justice Achala Wengappuli, the parties were directed to file their written submissions.
On September 7 2017, Lalith Weeratunga and Anusha Palpita were found guilty of misappropriating Rs.600 million of funds belonging to TRC over Controversial Sil Redi (fabrics used by devotees to observe sill) distribution case.
Through their appeal applications, two accused-appellants stated that they were seeking the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal to review and set aside their conviction imposed by the High Court dated September 7, 2017.
In their petitions, the accused-appellants stated that neither a sum of Rs.600 million nor a part of it were utilised by them for their personal gains.
They further stated that the High Court judge had given them a short period of time (13 days) to pay off the compensations.
While handing out a lengthy judgment, High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga had maintained that the prosecutors have proven the accused guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
The High Court Judge further maintained that the accused had committed this offence dishonestly with the intention of gaining undue advantage to a particular candidate during the 2015-Presidential Election.l
While observing a political motivation had led the accused to commit this offence, Lalith Weeratunge and Anusha Palpita were ordered to pay a compensation of Rs.50 million each to the TRC in lieu of losses incurred contrary to the Telecommunication Act.
