Paada Yatra aims at evading litigation: JHU

The prime objective of the Paada Yatra organised by the Joint Opposition was to make indirect influence on court cases that are being filed against former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, his family members and leading ministers of the previous regime, Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) Central Committee member Ven. Hedigalle Vimalasara Thera said.
He made these observations at a press conference at the JHU headquarters in Battaramulla.
The Thera said the JHU would not give up its struggle against corruptions committed by the previous regime whatever the Paada Yatras come to Colombo.
The Thera said although the Joint Opposition boasted to bring one million people to Colombo, including 2,000 Buddhist priests, they failed.
He said although the Paada Yatra started by observing the five precepts, the precepts were broken one by one along the way to Colombo.
“We could see how the liquor shops along the way were emptied. They used filthy language and said lies to mislead the people,” he said.
The Thera said although Mahinda Rajapaksa speaks on protecting Buddhism, he has done nothing to do so while he was in office.
“It was Mahinda Rajapaksa who prevented the Anti-conversion Bill moved against converting Buddhists to other religions,” the Thera said.
“When the Buddhist monks of the Malwatta Chapter instructed Mahinda Rajapaksa not to take revenge from Sarath Fonseka after his defeat at the Presidential Election, he said
he would form another chapter amalgamating Malwatta Chapter temples in the South,” he said.
JHU Central Committee member Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said a government cannot be toppled by a Paada Yatra.
The Joint Opposition’s objective was to create a political instability in the country to deviate foreign investment. Another objective was to divide the SLFP, he said.
Rajapaksa’s vision was not to allow the SLFP to come back to power if he cannot take over power. He said the Joint Opposition’s attempt was also to prevent the people yielding the benefits of the national government set up uniting the two main political parties in the country.
