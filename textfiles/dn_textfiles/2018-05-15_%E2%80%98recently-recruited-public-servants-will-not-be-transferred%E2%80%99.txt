‘Recently recruited public servants will not be transferred’

Recently recruited public servants would not be transferred from the place of their first appointment under whatever situation, Public Administration and Management Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara yesterday said.
He was addressing participants in a ceremony at Temple Trees held to grant appointment letters to recently recruited 4,511 appointees to the Public Management Assistant Service.
The Minister said that in addition to 4511 recruited, another 20,000 were recruited through the Public Administration and Management Ministry. He said the recruitment reflects the democracy of the Good Governance Government since they were recruited via a test. He said 65,000 persons faced the test.
The Minister said these youth were lucky because 47,000 unemployed graduates were awaiting employment opportunities. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Minister Daya Gamage were present.
