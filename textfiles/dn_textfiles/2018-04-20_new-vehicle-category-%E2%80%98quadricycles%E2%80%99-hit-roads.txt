New vehicle category ‘quadricycles’ to hit the roads

A new category of motorised four-wheelers, quadricycles, is set to hit the roads in Colombo and other cities soon, as the Department of Motor Traffic (DMT) has successfully completed the roadworthy test which is compulsory for new vehicles.
According to the DMT, two new classes of vehicles have been introduced following Amendment No.18 of the Motor Traffic Act 2017 and quadricycle is one of them. Quadricycles would be added to the driving licence card. Accordingly, 10 quadricycles were registered this year.
Refuting allegations leveled against the new vehicle by various groups, National Council for Road Safety (NCRS) Chairman Dr. Sisira Kodagoda told the Daily News that the council had conducted technical research for over two years prior to the introduction of the new vehicle category. Earlier, there had been several legal barriers for this vehicle category in India due to a court case.
However, in February this year, the Supreme Court of India had disposed the case and a draft notification had been issued by the Indian Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, approving the quadricycle as a vehicle category, he said, adding that the vehicle had completed its roadworthiness test and it was ready to launch.
Explaining the new vehicle category, Dr. Kodagoda said, “A quadricycle is essentially a light-weight motorized four-wheeler between a motorcycle and a car. Compared to two-wheelers and three-wheelers, quadricycle is the safest vehicle category as it has four wheels which will discourage the drivers squeezing through other vehicles during rush hour. It is a fully covered vehicle category which has similar features like a mini car and four passengers could travel at once.”
Predicting that the newly introduced vehicle category, quadricycle, would be a solution for traffic congestions, the NCRS Chairman said most road accidents were due to indiscipline, ignorance of the rules, neglect and disobedience. Therefore, the new vehicle category would be an innovative method in the country's road traffic management that could instill discipline in motorists.The NCRS Chairman added that false information was being circulated about the new vehicle category, that the quadricycle was unsafe as it failed the Euro NCAP (European New Car Assessment Programme) crash test.
“But the truth is that as per European standards, quadricycles are not subject to crash testing,” Dr. Kodagoda said.
Even though the quadricycle would not be an alternative to three-wheelers, it would discourage people from buying more three-wheelers as the quadricycle would serve as a family vehicle, Dr. Kodagoda added.
The council has held several discussions with three-wheeler associations before introducing the new vehicle category and they had endorsed the council's decision, he said.
