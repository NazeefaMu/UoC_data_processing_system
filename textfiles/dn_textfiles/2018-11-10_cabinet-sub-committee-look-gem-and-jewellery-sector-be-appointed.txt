Cabinet Sub Committee to look into gem and jewellery sector to be appointed

A Cabinet Sub Committee would be appointed to look into unsettled issues in the Gem and Jewellery sector, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
He stated this at a special meeting held at the President’s Office to discuss issues prevailing at the Gem and Jewellery sector of the country.
He said the government is expected to follow a simple policy to solve these issues.
At the meeting, the President instructed officials to submit a report by next week on the raids conducted by them on illegal gem mining and fake gem dealers during last year.
Issuing permits for gem mining on lands belonging to the Land Reform Commission, the Circular issued by the Department of Agrarian Development on the use of paddy fields for gem mining, permitting for mechanical gem mining, not taking steps to fill back the used mines and time duration for obtaining gem mining licenses were among other key areas discussed at the meeting.
