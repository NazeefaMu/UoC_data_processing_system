First cheque deposit machine

The Commercial Bank of Ceylon launched the first fully-automated cheque deposit service machine at its City Office in York Street, Colombo this week.
This cheque deposit machine eliminates the need for the filling up of cheque and account details on a deposit envelope. The depositor is required only to key in the account number along with the account holder’s telephone number, before placing the cheque in the allocated slot.
Saving time and enhancing convenience of customers, the machine will scan the cheques and extract all other required information. The machine can scan up to 25 cheques of a single customer at a time, and email all images of cheques and receipts to a registered email address.
Additionally, customers could also receive images of up to two scanned cheques in the receipt from the machine.
