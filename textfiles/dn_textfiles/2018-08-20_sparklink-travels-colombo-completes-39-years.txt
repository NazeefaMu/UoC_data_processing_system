Sparklink Travels Colombo completes 39 years

Sparklink Travels Colombo marked the completion of 39 years in Travel Excellence last week.
Sparklink Travels, Chairman, Nihal Perera, a Former Director of Sri Lanka Tourism, and a pioneer and legend in the Travel Industry recalled that they commenced business in 1979, at a time where there was limited travel.
“When we launched the business the company promoted its travel services with intelligence, empathy and hard work to go forward in the travel industry. To survive in tumultuous times over the past several years and achieve success was a tall order but we survived.”
One of our earlier achievements was the active promotion of Thomas Cook Holidays in Sri Lanka as their General Sales Agent offering a wide range of holiday packages worldwide with cruises to ‘Explore the World’
“Sparklink Travels Colombo also offered very competitive deals on airfares.”
Today Nihal is supported by sons Praki Perera and Navein Perera with a team of dedicated staff, achieved another milestone by launching their services internationally, in Australia.
Praki Perera moved to Melbourne and established Sparklink in Melbourne as their International travel arm.
Navein Perera today has moved to the position of Managing Director to steer the company to greater heights.
In a bid to provide continued travel services in a more congenial environment, the operations of the travel service was also moved from St. Michaels Road to Liberty Arcade recently.
“On our anniversary, the management likes to express our gratitude to valued clients, together with all its internationally connected partners in travel worldwide- airlines, civil aviation. Sri Lanka Tourism, Ministry of Tourism and banks for sustaining the travel, tourism, aviation and hospitality industry of Sri Lanka.
“Sparklink Travels will continue to satisfy customers and their demands in all aspects of travel with outbound travel and inbound travel with the associate company, Sparklink Holidays and Tours in the future as well,” Nihal Perera said.
“The company serves its valued clients with the ‘Right Connections’ to any destination worldwide.”
