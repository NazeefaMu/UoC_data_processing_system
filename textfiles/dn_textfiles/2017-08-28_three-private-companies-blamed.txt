Three private companies blamed

Farmers in Embilipitiya allege that farm wells they use for cultivation down the ages are running dry due to big tube wells dug by three private companies in the area.
Embilipitiya Weerabahu Farmers Society Secretary W. Kularatne said tube wells established by the three firms were 300 feet deep and they used motors to pump water. Therefore, most of the underground sprouts had gone dry, the farmers complain.
They request authorities to intervene and protect the water resources of farmers from the three companies.
