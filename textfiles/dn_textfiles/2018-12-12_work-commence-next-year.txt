Kurunegala-Habarana new railway line:
Work to commence next year

Preliminary work on the Kurunegala-Habarana new railway line continues and the work will commence in 2020, sources said.
Project Director V.Amarathunga told Daily News that the Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau (CECB) has completed the pre-feasibility study of the project and the preliminary survey of the rail track was completed up to Dambulla by the Survey Department now. He said the land acquisition is carried out in the Kurunegala and the Mallawapitiya Divisional Secretariats.
The length of the track from Kurunegala to Habarana via Dambulla is 86 kilometres. An additional double track of four kilometres runs to the Dambulla Economic Centre. Six main stations lie at Ibbagamuwa, Melsiripura, Galewala,Dambulla, Sigiriya ( Inamaluwa) and Habarana with sub-stations at Thorayaya, Gokarella, Thalkiriyagma and Digampathana, he said.
Three tunnels will be constructed at Ibbagamuwa, Polgolla and Omaragolla and several bridges, viaducts, overpasses and underpasses will be designed at several locations.
The underpasses are especially for the elephants for them to move since the track will runs through jungle.
Under the 5-year plan of ‘Let’s Awaken Polonnaruwa’ District Development Programme (2016-2020), the rail track from Kurunegala to Habarana via Dambulla has been identified as a priority, he said.
The Habarana railway line will run across Dambulla and Sigiriya in the North Central Province providing convenient transportation for the people in the Eastern and North Central Provinces.
The project is funded through a loan from the EXIM Bank, China.
