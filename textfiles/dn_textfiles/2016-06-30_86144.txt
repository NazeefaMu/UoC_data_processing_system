Sangakkara names his All Time XI

 
NEW DELHI: Iconic batsman Sachin Tendulkar did not find a place in Kumar Sangakkara's list of all-time XI while Rahul Dravid was the lone Indian in the team selected by the former Sri Lankan skipper.
Sangakkara believes Dravid, who is currently India A coach, will be the best to complement former Australian batsman Mathews Hayden in the opening slot in the squad led by former Lankan batsman Aravinda de Silva.
"Mathew Hayden will be at the top of the order facing the first ball and to complement him, I have got Rahul Dravid," said Sangakkara in a video published on social media by the Lord's Cricket Ground.
In the batting line up, the regal left-handed batsman picked his 'all time favourite batsman' Brian Lara along with former Aussie captain Ricky Ponting.
Top all-rounder Jacques Kallis will complete the line up and erstwhile Australian wicket keeper Adam Gilchrist will be donning the gloves behind the wickets. The 46-year-old Sangakkara believes Shane Warne and Muthiah Muralitharan are the two specialist spinners who are the best he has ever seen as they can bowl well in any condition.
The fast bowling department will have legendary Lankan pacer Chaminda Vaasalong with former Pakistan pacer Wasim Akram as Sangakkara viewed him as an 'unbelievable challenge' to face.
The former Sri Lankan skipper opted for players that he had played with and against. Hence there was no mention of Donald Bradman and Viv Richards in the line-up.
Interestingly, the stylish left-hander omitted batting legend Sachin Tendulkar from his XI. In fact, no Indian other than Dravid made the cut in his elite team.
Baffled by Sanga's decision to leave out the 'God of Cricket', Indians fans questioned the reason behind the former's strange decision.
The 38-year-old informed his Twitter followers that it was hard not just to omit Sachin but also former India opener Virender Sehwag. He also added that India's current Test skipper Virat Kohli may go on to become better than all batting greats in the near future. Hence fitting all these players was not possible.
Despite Sanga's clarification, Indians fans found it hard to digest the fact a batsman with 100 international hundreds did not make it to a list of this sort.
The list in total has four Australian and three Lankan while a lone spot for Indian, Pakistan, South African and West Indian players.
