Officials of Diplomatic Missions to be recalled for training - Prime Minister
Plans are afoot to recall officials of the Sri Lanka's Diplomatic Missions next year to provide them a training on the government's policy, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament yesterday.
He said that there were talented officials in foreign diplomatic missions, while while there are those who were not so. Some officials lacked even the basic knowledge about the government's policy. They have to be provided with a proper training concerning such matter. All the officials would be brought back to Sri Lanka to undergo training," Premier Wickremesinghe said." Officials of the foreign diplomatic missions would be unable to play the same pranks they played earlier. They would not be able to say that foreign countries stood against us. That era ended in 2014.
He made these observations while responding to a question raised by opposition MP Bimal Ratnayake for oral answers. The Premier responded while Foreign Affairs Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva was resonding to Bimal Ratnayake. MP Ratnayake stated that the previous government appointed persons to foreign diplomatic missions, who did not belong to the Sri Lankan Foreign Service.
"It is only at present that those officials attempt to study what the government policy was. It would take a period of two to three years to build up a strong foreign service," Premier Wickremesinghe said. "We could build up a good foreign service.
The UNP has commendable foreign relationship than foreign diplomatic missions. We could impart that experience to the foreign service," he said
"Out of the 47 persons appointed to foreign diplomatic missions by the present government, 23 did not belong to the permanent Sri Lankan Foreign Service," Bimal Ratnayake said. "But there is a policy that only 30 percent could be appointed to foreign diplomatic missions out of those who do not belong to foreign diplomatic missions.
At this stage the Premier stated that there is no such agreement on policy that point out such a proportionate. "Suitable persons should be appointed to the foreign diplomatic missions," Premier Wickremesinghe said.
"No where in the world could such a proportionate be maintained. We too don't hope to maintain such a policy. We would appoint 100 percent of those who are qualified persons." At this stage Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake stated that some members of the UNP Working Committee have been appointed to foreign diplomatic missions.
"I became the first Foreign Affairs Deputy Minister. We have to work between the countries and some of the officials of the foreign diplomatic mission lacked the necessary foreign relationship." Premier Wickremesinghe said. But the members of the UNP Working Committee could solve international matters via the telephone.
He also said that the government needed to develop relationships with some countries, adding He that such relationships are being built with the USA. "The benefits of UNPs relationships would be brought to Sri Lanka," the Premier said.
Although there is no High Commissioner in UK, we have sound relationships with UK."
At this stage opposition MP Bimal Ratnayake stated that he condemned such a statement by the Prime Minister, as it would be understood that a foreign service was not needed but only clerks would suffice.
"The matters concerning Geneva were settled by me as the Foreign Minister and the Ministry Secretary, the Premier said.
"Since late Prime Minister D. S. Senanayaka's period, diplomatic matters were settled politically.
 
Bridge connecting Rameshwaran and Thalaimannar:
Sri Lanka opposes India's proposal - Kiriella
The Sri Lankan government was opposed to India's proposal to build a bridge connecting Rameshwaram of Southern India and Thalaimannar, Leader of the House and University Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella told a group of journalists yesterday.
The minister was commenting on the Indian Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari's statement to the Lok Sabha last Wednesday.
He said that India had planned to build a sea bridge and tunnel connecting Sri Lanka, but Sri Lanka would not agree with the proposed project.
"We could not let India build the Sea Bridge connecting Rameswaram with Thalaimannar as the people of Sri Lanka would be against it," the Minister said. Indian Minister Gadkari on Wednesday in a statement in the Lok Sabha has said: "The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has pledged to fully finance a bridge-building project connecting Rameshwaram and Sri Lanka.
The project was also discussed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi with his counterpart during the latter's recent visit."
The India - Sri Lanka connectivity project's cost is pegged at about 24,000 Indian Crore.
 
Is the government importing coconuts, queries MP Handunnetti
JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti speaking in Parliament yesterday, urged the government to express its stance whether coconuts are being imported to the country or not.
He was joining the committee stage debate of Budget 2016, under the financial heads of eight Ministries referred to the Select Committee.
He said the government had given an assurance earlier that it would not allow the import of coconuts to Sri Lanka, but this budget has proposed to import coconuts to the country.
Import of coconuts to the country would lead to a collapse of the local coconut industry. Therefore, the government should not do so, but the government should take short and or long-term measures to improve coconut cultivation instead of importing coconuts.
Handunnetti said the tea industry too is on the verge of collapse due to low prices. It is necessary that measures be taken to ensure a reasonable price for tea growers in the country.
 
Budget would help enhance living conditions of estate sector - Thondaman
Ceylon Workers Congress (CWC) Leader MP Arumugam Thondaman told in Parliament yesterday, that the CWC would support the government's good projects, while the government should not marginalize the estate people considering them as a minority.
He also said that Budget 2016 would help the estate community to enhance their living conditions.
He said that estate workers have to face various hardships due to the reduction of tea prices and the prevailing weather condition of the country. When we urge the estate owners to increase the salaries of workers, they claim that they could not do so, as the government had cut down subsidies.
We also urged them to adjust the working hours of estate workers, considering weather conditions prevailing in the area. The CWC Leader also urged the government to continue with the development projects initiated by the previous regime.
New adjustment between taxes on new vehicles and budget proposals - Finance Minister
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake clarified yesterday in Parliament that there was an adjustment made between the new taxes imposed on motor vehicles and the new budget proposals on vehicles, but there was no intention whatsoever to use these laws to clear vehicles from the Customs.
Although there was a mechanism to release vehicles by the Customs prior to January 8, we formulated a system to release vehicles based on their actual value.
There had been allegations in the media about the release of 700 vehicles which have been undervalued and ordered to be released from Customs without levying the actual import duty.
He said that those who had imported these vehicles were asked to pay a duty surcharge of 35 per cent. The minister said the Government had also taken steps to stop the release of containers carrying undervalued goods until the importers pay the duty on the actual value of the goods.
"We got to know that there were instances of under invoicing to import expensive vehicles. We had discussions with Customs officers and importers to formulate a valuation mechanism for importing vehicles. We decided on an official value of those vehicles. We stopped the clearing of vehicles by illegal manner and imposed a very high tax on such imports. After adding this to the budget, we were told that vehicles could be imported at lower rates. This is being projected as a big fraud.
These vehicles are not cleared until the budget and we realized that the sercharge tax was more than the tax imposed. So we wanted to be fare by the importers and consumers. This hue and cry is because all
these times, illegal proceedings from the clearing of vehicles went to a few people during the previous regime and now it has been completely stopped.

Joining the committee stage debate on Budget Proposals 2016, Minister Abeywardane said that the government planned to devolve power up to village level through the "Grama Rajya" system.

Country's main issue to uplift its rural economy - Minister Harrison
Rural Economy Minister P. Harrison told in Parliament yesterday, that the country's main issue is to uplift rural economy.
Previous regimes had taken various measures, including the Jana Saviya and the Samurdhi to uplift the rural economy. But still, the rural economy of the country had not been uplifted to its expected level.
To uplift the rural economy, we would have to provide better prices for rural products. So we are planning to take measures to upgrade economic centres with freezing facilities to create a good market for fruits and vegetables.
Earlier, the government purchased only five percent of the country's paddy production, while this year we could be able to purchase 10 percent of the total paddy production.
Speaking about the farmers' protest that was held on Thursday, Minister Harrison said that last year the government allocated only Rs. 30 billion for the fertilizer subsidy, while the budget 2016 had allocated Rs.37 billion in this regard.
He also emphasized the necessity of finding an alternative to agro chemicals in order to eradicate kidney diseases rapidly spreading in agricultural areas.

The MP pointed out that salaries of the doctors and public sector employees have been increased during the budget debate was in progress and asked as to why the government could not increase the salaries of the plantation workers.
