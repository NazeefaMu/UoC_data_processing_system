O’Shea’s Italy reeling after All Blacks bashing

ROME, Sunday : Conor O’Shea’s Italy turn their focus to next year’s Six Nations and the Rugby World Cup with morale at a low after another bruising defeat 66-3 at the hands of New Zealand.
“We didn’t do many good things but they were too angry and eager to redeem themselves after last week’s defeat,” said O’Shea after the All Blacks’ avenged their loss to Ireland with a ten-try rampage in the Stadio Olimpico.
Italy have never beaten New Zealand in 15 meetings, losing 68-10 in their last match in Rome in 2016.
But this time the Azzurri didn’t even score a try, settling for Tommaso Allan’s penalty kick in the first 15 minutes.
Italy were also without injured skipper Sergio Parisse for their November Tests.
The Stade Francais No. 8 missed the 26-7 defeat to Australia in Padua the previous weekend and Italy’s 28-17 win over Georgia.
Dean Budd -- one of two New Zealand-born players lining out for Italy -- said that 12 months of hard work and preparation had come undone within minutes.
“The ball was too fast and we couldn’t keep up,” said the 32-year-old Treviso lock. – AFP
