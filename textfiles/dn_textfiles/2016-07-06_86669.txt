Red Bull Kart Fight on July 9-10

After two seasons of intense wheel-to-wheel action, Red Bull Kart Fight returns to sunny Sri Lanka for an all-new, all-out race to find the island’s best amateur karter on July 9 and 10.
Red Bull Kart Fight is an amateur karting competition that gives drivers across the country the chance to experience the smell of burning rubber for real.
The first edition of Red Bull Kart Fight in Sri Lanka was held in 2012, and was the first international pro-karting event of its kind in the country. Eshan Siriwardena, who emerged victorious after three stages of high-speed action on a custom track around Independence Square, went on to represent Sri Lanka at the Red Bull Kart Fight World Finals in Italy.
More recently in 2015, Hafzel Preena was crowned National Champion after racing through the lush Kanway Autodrome in Mirigama, winning an exclusive tour of the Red Bull Racing Factory and an experience at the Silverstone Circuit in England.
Karters will once again start their engines on the tropical tarmac in Mirigama and battle for a spot in the coveted national finals for this year’s edition of Red Bull Kart Fight. The King of the Circuit and this year’s National Champion will drive away with Rs. 200,000 in prize money. This will be followed by the second and third place winning Rs. 100,000 and Rs. 50,000 respectively.
“Racing back at Kanway Autodrome, Mirigama is not going to be easy – I am sure drivers from last year are going to be back to compete for the title of King of the Circuit” said Hafzel Preena, who is looking to defend his title of National Champion.
“Over the years, Red Bull has been instrumental in cultivating a novice racing culture in Sri Lanka,” said Shane Gunawardena. “These racers are fueled by a competitive rush of adrenalin that demonstrates the immense potential of Sri Lanka’s budding motorsport talent and I believe Red Bull Kart Fight is the perfect platform to take their skills to the next level.”
