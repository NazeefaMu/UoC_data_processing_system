Capt. A V Rajendra heads SLANA

The second AGM of Sri Lanka Association of NVOCC Agents (SLANA) was held on June 26, 2018 at the Mont Blanc, Movenpick Hotel, with Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka as chief guest.
Sujeiva Samaraweera, Chairman National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka also participated for this event as a key speaker.
SLANA Chairman Capt. A V Rajendra, among other issues highlighted the fact that the Ceylon Shipping Corporation which currently does not own any container ships should pursue to become the strongest NVOCC operator in the region.
He also said that, for NVOCCs to be attracted to the port of Colombo, the regulation on the restrictions of the recovery of THC should abolished without any further delay.
“SLANA was formed in the year 2016 for a few specific reasons; to gain due recognition for its members, to address the issues faced by its members, to protect the interest of its members, to keep the members informed of various rules and regulations or amendments to the existing practices introduced by the state or other relevant institutions, to promote education and training and most importantly to facilitate and promote NVO trade and businesses through the port of Colombo”, he said.
“Unlike in distant past, SLANA members are now able to readily comply and adhere to industry requirements with the assistance of SLANA Secretariat as there wasn’t a professional body to represent NVOCC Agents prior to the formation of SLANA. NVOs are a dominant force in the Indian Sub-continent, West Asia and South East Asia and its presence is vital for the Sri Lankan trade. It had to be harnessed and promoted for the benefit of the trade.
NVOCC agencies belong to the SME sector. Their growth can be strengthened by the legislators and policy makers”, he said.
“In view of the above we are thankful to the Minister of Ports and Shipping and the Chairman of Sri Lanka Ports Authority Dr. Parakrama Dissanayake for recognizing the importance of NVOCCs by giving NVOCCs a place in the proposed Maritime Policy document. The Appointment of Chairmanship of the SLPA, a knowledgeable personality from the maritime industry, is always helpful because of the necessity to understand the needs and importance of the service providers and their contribution to this niche trade,” he said.
“The maritime industry realized the importance of the NVOCCs few years ago only when major shipping lines withdrew their services from certain ports in view of the economic sanctions imposed by the UN on those countries. Our exporters were left stranded and NVOCCs stood by the exporters to export their cargoes to those countries. A couple of years thereafter, due to some haphazard decisions taken by the legislators and policy makers on shore based cost recoveries including Terminal Handling Charges, the businesses of service providers along with NVOs were hampered. NVO Principals began to look at Colombo as a negative destination”, he said.
“Imposition of UN sanctions on certain countries cannot be ruled out in the near future and once again NVOCCs support may be called upon by the trade for its exports with the possibility of shipping lines withdrawal from these countries. NVOCCs must be supported and encouraged with a level playing field as is in the region, to allow and permit to recover shore based costs which are currently being prevented by so called regulations. SLANA is prepared to standby the Sri Lanka shippers and exporters by ignoring the shore based costs including the Terminal Handlings Charges for the benefit of the exporters and country, but it will be only viable if the overall blanket prohibition of recovery on shore based costs is lifted to sustain their businesses in Sri Lanka, or otherwise the eagerness of NVOCCs doing business in Sri Lanka will always remain doubtful,” he said.
“As a nation Sri Lanka is on the world map for container operations. The Sri Lanka Ports Authority together with the Private Terminals are doing a great job in making the port of Colombo a leading port in the world, mainly with the container volume throughput of major Shipping Lines. Other ports while vying hard to achieve the same, aggressively promote NVOCCs and multi-country consolidations which bring in tremendous revenue to a country”, he added.
