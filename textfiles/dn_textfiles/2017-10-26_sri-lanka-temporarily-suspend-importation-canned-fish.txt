Sri Lanka to temporarily suspend importation of canned fish

 
The Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry has decided to temporarily suspend the importation of canned fish and fish varieties - except Koppara and Thalapath - to Sri Lanka due to an increase of local fish harvest, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
During a discussion held today with the fish sellers at the Peliyagoda fish market, they informed the Minister that the fish harvest from the southern sea and other sea areas is increasing gradually these days. As a result of that the price of fish varieties such as Linna, Balaya, Parawa, Kumbalawa, Salaya, Halmessa, Anjilawo has decreased.
With the intention of managing this situation, the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry today made a request to the Finance Ministry to take necessary measures to stop the importation of fish and canned fish.
Currently Sri Lanka is importing around 120,000 metric tons of fish and canned fish.
