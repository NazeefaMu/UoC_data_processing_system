Plans afoot to develop hospitals, dispensaries in Central Province

Plans are afoot to develop estate hospitals and dispensaries in the Central Province and the programme will cost the Government Rs. 3,000 million.
Under the programme estate hospitals and dispensaries in the Matale, Kandy and Nuwaraeliya districts will be developed.
Many of the hospitals in the province had been constructed during the British era. A majority are not functioning now and the estate workers have to travel long distances for medical treatments.
Ongoing programme will immensely benefit them.
