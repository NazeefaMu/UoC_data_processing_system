Art for every wall

Sulochana Vajirakantha is a state award winning artist who has a passion towards reproducing twwemple paintings. A graduate from the University of Visual and Performing Arts, Colombo, Sulochana currently works as the teacher of Arts at the Ibbagamuwa Central School in her hometown and mentors her students on becoming creative and innovative artistes.
With the ambition of taking the art of Sri Lankan temple paintings to the world, Sulochana works on experimentation and innovation.
Why did you pursue Sri Lankan temple painting techniques?
That is my passion. I loved to look at temple paintings from my early childhood. Paintings drawn on the walls of ancient temples fascinated me. As a child I tried to reproduce them. My parents, elders and teachers appreciated my work and encouraged me to master this art.
My reproductions of temple paintings won accolades and awards in competitions and I was motivated to indulge more on the subject.
I learnt the finer points in reproducing traditional paintings while I was at university.
You won the state award in the temple paintings category in 2007.
Winning the state award was an encouragement to me. It enhanced my reputation as a credible artist.
I would prefer if artistes of my caliber are offered the opportunity to hold exhibitions in other countries too. Temple paintings in Sri Lanka are unique to our country and we should take it to the macro level. I respect the late maestro Majusri who did yeomen service to conserve ancient Sri Lankan traditional paintings depicting Jataka stories.
As a school teacher how do you groom your students to become fine artists?
I am determined to provide them with sound guidance. Art is a vast subject and as teachers we cannot restrict our students on their creativity.
Creativity sheds light on them becoming sensible individuals. In addition to Art I teach them about our history, heritage, values, attitudes and appreciation of art and also about the society as a whole and Marketing. They must be provided with this exposure and knowledge to create new things.
I teach them to think out-of-the-box because that’s what I do.
Some people representing themselves as artists copy, cut and paste others’ works to earn a quick buck.
Ethics play a vital role here. It is alright to study methods used by others but one should find his/her unique way of creation.
I am working on finding my own way of producing temple paintings.
Once your work is accepted by the world, finances will fall in line.
You are doing in fabric painting too.
Yes. Once I did fabric painting on a Saree and wore it myself. Surprisingly my peers liked that design and began to place orders with me for more designs. Then it looked like a lucrative avenue for me.
Recently the SLRC ‘Nuga Sevana’ program featured me as a Saree designer. Fabric painting has become my second profession now.
What are your other talents?
Any artiste has diverse talents. I can sing and I worked as a draftswoman some time back.
However we must position ourselves in the society by doing the most passionate thing we could do.
I want to position myself as an innovative temple painting artist.
I look forward to keep this distinctive style of art on a global platform.
