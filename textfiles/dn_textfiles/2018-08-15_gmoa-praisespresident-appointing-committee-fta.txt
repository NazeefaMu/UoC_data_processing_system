GMOA praisesPresident for appointing committee on FTA

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) praised President Maithripala Sirisena for appointing a committee to look into the impact of the Free Trade Agreement signed with Singapore, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
He was addressing a press briefing at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo, yesterday.
Dr. Aluthge said the GMOA had requested the President to halt the implementation of the agreement for two months until the committee report is handed over to the President.
Dr. Aluthge said appointing a reputed economic expert such as Prof. W. D. Lakshman as the Chairman of the committee assures the credibility of the committee appointed by the President.
“The agreement contains 19 conditions which are disadvantageous to the country. Already, seven parties, including the GMOA and the Sri Lanka Bar Association, have taken legal action against this agreement. “The GMOA is creating awareness for all, including the President, the Archbishop of Colombo Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, Mahanayake Theras of the Three Chapters and others about the agreement,” he added.
