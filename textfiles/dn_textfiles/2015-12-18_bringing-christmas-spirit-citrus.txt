Bringing in the Christmas spirit at Citrus

Citrus Waskaduwa and Citrus Hikkaduwa welcomed the Christmas season with the traditional Christmas tree lighting ceremony at each of the properties.
Citrus Waskaduwa commenced the season early this month with the tree lighting ceremony, complete with Christmas carols, lights, festive décor and of course a scrumptious spread of traditional Christmas treats. Guests were caroling along while some preferred to show off their dancing skills.
The night sparked with bright smiles, festive cheer and much fun by both the hotels' staff and guests.
Citrus Hikkaduwa kicked off their Christmas festivities with the Christmas tree lighting ceremony followed by a festive get-together at the hotel's lobby, where guests and staff merrily indulged in Christmas treats and festive fun.
At the Citrus resorts guests are sure to experience the wonderful things that each new day brings. Fill the days and nights with excursions, themed events, fine dining and more.
Indulge in as much or as little as one pleases. The choice is theirs.
