SM LINE enters global container shipping trade

The newly established SM LINE is making a bold entry into the container shipping trades, with an initial suite of six services covering the North-East Asia, South East Asia, Far East – Indian Subcontinent and the Trans Pacific routes, with the services launching during March and April 2017.
The Samra Midas Group or the SM Group’s roots originated with the Engineering and Construction business and has dynamically grown its business portfolio into manufacturing and service businesses through several significant mergers and acquisitions over the years.
The SM Group started its business in 1988 with the birth of Samra Engineering & Construction. The company’s rapid growth started in 2004 with the expansion of business through many acquisitions.
The acquisition of Korea Line Corporation (KLC) in 2013 was a land mark in SM Group’s journey. KLC is a leading Dry Bulk Carrier specialized in energy resource transportation and thus the SM Group entering the global shipping carrier business. SM LINE was officially launched on the 5th January 2017 and has received the approvals from the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC), USA and the Ministry of Transport (MOT), China to carry out shipping services. The WIN, VTX and KHX services were launched during March ’17 and the CPX, KHX and the EIN was launched during April ’17. During the second half of 2017, SM LINE will further expand by launching services to the Pacific North ports in the USA.
SM LINE would be the only Trans Pacific carrier to provide a service to her customers on an independent service using only SM LINE vessels.
The five 6500 Teu vessels (SM Shanghai, SM Ningbo, SM Yantian, SM Busan, SM Long Beach) on the CPX service boasts of a 10 and 12 day transit time from Busan and Shanghai to Long Beach.
The cargo from Colombo would connect the CPX from the port of Shanghai. SM LINE will provide services from Colombo to Port Kelang, Singapore, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Ningbo, Ho Chi Ming, Busan, Kwangyang and Long Beach. The inbound service to Colombo would include Nhavashiva and Pipav in addition to the above mentioned ports.
“Our very existence depends on the customers, which is why we always try to conduct our business from their point of view. In fact, our prompt response to their needs has been the driving force of our growth over the years,” said the Chairman of SM Group.
