Sixteen SEUSL undergrads arrested for contempt

Akkaraipattu Police have arrested 16 undergraduates who had been forcefully occupying the Administrative Block of the South Eastern University of Sri Lanka (SEUSL) since October 12. They are in Akkaraipattu Police custody at present.
The University has been made “Out of Bounds” for the 16 undergraduates and students from the Faculty of Technology had staged a protest demanding that their fellow undergrads be taken back without any conditions.
The undergrads who were arrested had been occupying the University’s Administrative Block since October 12, paralyzing administrative activities.
Following an entry lodged with the Police by the University authorities, the Akkaraipattu Magistrate’s Court had ordered that the occupying students be evicted from the Administration Block of the South Eastern University. However, they ignored the Courts Order and continued to stay.
Meanwhile, Registrar H. Abdul Saththar had subsequently declared that the South Eastern University of Sri Lanka premises are out of bounds for all students with effect from 12 noon on Octiber 24,2018 until further notice. The protesting students did not move from the Administration block even after this order and were later arrested by the Police.
University staff who were barred from entering the Administrative Block by the occupying students since October 12, have now resumed their normal duties.
Those students who were arrested by Police were to be produced before the Akkaraipattu Magistrate’s Courts last afternoon.
