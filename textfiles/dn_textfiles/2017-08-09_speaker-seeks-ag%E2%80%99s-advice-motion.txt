Speaker seeks AG’s advice on motion

The No Confidence Motion tendered against Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake by the Joint Opposition and Parliament has not been objected to by any party, Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Parliament yesterday.
He said that in the event there is objection to certain clauses of the motion, the speaker would have to consult the Attorney General.
He said Parliament could act on it in accordance with the Speaker’s decision respecting the Parliamentary democracy. The Premier also said that the party leaders have discussed on the motion at the Party Leaders’ Meeting and Parliament could act transparently on the decision of Speaker Karu Jayasuriya reached at the Party Leader’s meeting.
He made these observations yesterday in Parliament expressing his views when the opposition queried of the process of the No Confidence Motion moved by the Joint Opposition.
Speaker Karu Jaysuriya observed that the future course of action with regard to the no-confidence motion submitted by the Joint Opposition against the Foreign Minister will be informed to the House on Thursday.
The Speaker also observed that there are some legal issues pertaining to the motion and its content and the matter has been referred to the Attorney General. Joint Opposition member Wimal Weerawansa raising a point of order inquired as to why the government delays the process of no-confidence motion and delays the debate.
Speaker Jayasuriya said he will inform the matter on Thursday. “I have received the motion. It is sub judice as the matter is being investigated in the Presidential Commission too,” the Speaker said. “I need to consult the Attorney General in this regard. When the response of Attorney General comes to me I would decide what could be done with regard to the motion and let you know”.
At this occasion Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe asked if the opposition was asking the Foreign Minister to go before the UN office in Colombo with a mat and start a demonstration there. “The Speaker will inform the House of his decision,” Premier Wickremasinghe said. “We are doing everything in a transparent manner.”
