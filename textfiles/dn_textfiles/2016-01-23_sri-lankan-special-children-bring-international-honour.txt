Sri Lankan Special Children bring international honour

Eight Sri Lankan special children (Intellectually disabled) participated in a South Asia Pacific Bocce tournament held in Brunei recently brought honour to Sri Lanka by winning three gold, 16 silver and five bronze medals.
Four boys and four girls accompanied by two coaches at the tournament. They have battled with contenders from nine South Asian nations including India, Pakistan, Brunei Darussalam, Bangladesh, East Malaysia, West Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and Nepal.
After two days of qualifying round, Sri Lanka romped into semi-final round and managed to bag 24 medals.
Intellectually disabled people are categorised under differently able people. Even though they are capable of several activities, they are neglected, isolated and ill-treated. There are more than 660,000 Intellectually disabled people in Sri Lanka and that counts 3% of the population. We should recognise their abilities and give them a chance to come forward to associate with the community as normal people. There are three main aspects they can interact with the society. Those are through music, dancing and sports. Among them the sport is the main pathway for them to develop communication, interaction and self-caring.
Special Olympics Serendib is an organization working closely with a US based one of the world's largest charity organization, Special Olympics International which originated by the Kennedy family. Our responsibility in this establishment is to find new Intellectually disabled people and train them under their instructions. After selecting the capable athletes we send them for the Olympic Games which is a biannual international event . Other than Bocce we are participating in Swimming, Badminton, Athletics, Cricket, Volleyball, Football (Soccer) and Snow shoeing. Any Intellectually disable child have the opportunity to join and participate in Special Olympics game by registering with Special Olympics Serendib (Sri Lanka).
