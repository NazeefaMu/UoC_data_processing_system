Custom designed mythical kingdom

Dragons, battles and daring adventures. The beauty of fantasy novels is that they can take you to other worlds, but what if you could live in another realm every day? Well, Oregon artist and house developer Ed Bemis managed to make that possible. Tucked away in the foothills of Ashland, Oregon sits Shining Hand Ranch, a whimsical home that is so detailed it is fit for royalty from your favorite book.
This dream home was completely custom created by local artists and incorporates eco-friendly features. The space is heated and cooled with the use of geothermal energy with a solar heated pool. Intricate, hand-made pieces are the cornerstone of what makes this home unique. Bemis spent 1 1/2 years alone carving the Brazilian mahogany arched front door. The 8,881-square-foot property spans across 706-acres, enough room to keep your dragon on.
