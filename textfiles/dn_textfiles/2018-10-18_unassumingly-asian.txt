Seven flavours of Asia at Mövenpick  Hotel Colombo
Unassumingly Asian

The Robata Grill and Lounge has been wowing the city since arriving on the dining scene in early 2017. Put simply, Robata means“Fireside cooking” which results in dramatic and delicious flavour, and people love it.
The “Asian Food” umbrella is of course, a wide one when you consider the mouth-watering tapestry of ethnic cuisines that make the eats of the East. The Robata, introduces seven flavours of Asia including Japanese, Chinese, Malaysian, Indonesian, Singaporean, Korean and Thai.

From delicate Cantonese and fiery Sichuan delights to top quality sushi and steaming bowls of rib-sticking ramen, the Robata will also offer more than just delicious Pad Thai and Panang curry. Chow down on kimchi and indulge In Bulgogi or savour some spicy sambal, soupy laksa or dive into some delightful Nasi Goreng. Share the flavours and celebrate the variety.
Putting on a party? Then get a room! It will be a party to remember as the Robata Grill and Lounge now offers private dining rooms, also ideal for your business lunch meetings.
