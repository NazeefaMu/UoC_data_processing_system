Over 110 maternal deaths in Sri Lanka during 2016

A total of 112 maternal deaths had taken place in Sri Lanka during the last year (2016), the Maternal Death Review Report said.
According to the report, the percentage of maternal deaths in Sri Lanka in 2016 is 33.8 percent for each 100,000 live births. This is the best ratio in South Asia. But unfortunately, 55 percent of those deaths had been preventable.
The report says that the maternal death ratio did not show a change (any decrease or increase) during the past seven years, but direct maternal deaths had shown an increase last year, which is 55 percent. A total of 44 percent of maternal deaths were due to some sort of shortcoming of health staff.
The report points out that 68 percent of all maternal deaths had some sort of delay in a stage of the procedure. A total of 43 percent of dead mothers had neither been provided with the required medical advice nor were they taken to the hospital, on time. A total of 20 percent of maternal deaths were due to not obtaining required family planning services.
