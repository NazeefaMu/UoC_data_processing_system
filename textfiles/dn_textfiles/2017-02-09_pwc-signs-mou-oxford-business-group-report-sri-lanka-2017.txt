PwC signs MoU with Oxford Business Group for The Report: Sri Lanka 2017

The key role that the gradual liberalisation of Sri Lanka’s trade and investment laws is expected to play in boosting FDI will be explored in a forthcoming report by the global publishing firm Oxford Business Group (OBG).
The Report: Sri Lanka 2017 will shine a spotlight on the big-ticket projects, led by Colombo Port City and Megapolis, that are set to act as a driver of economic growth in the mid-term by attracting foreign interest and mobilising capital inflows.
OBG’s publication will highlight the competitive advantages that Sri Lanka offers investors, which include a high level of human resource development, especially in ICT, and a strategic location. It will also consider the challenges that the country faces, led by a balance of payments issue, rising debt levels and the need to implement for consistent fiscal policy.
PwC has signed a first-time memorandum of understanding (MoU) with OBG for the publishing firm’s forthcoming report on the country. Under the MOU, the professional services company will compile and produce the Tax chapter of The Report: Sri Lanka 2017.
Sujeewa Mudalige, PwC’s Managing Partner, said it was evident that OBG’s publications provided useful insights for investors on the Sri Lankan economy and its prospects by relaying important macroeconomic information to key decision-makers across the region. “PwC Sri Lanka always focuses on building relationships and creating value in the markets we serve and we are delighted to contribute to Oxford Business Group’s forthcoming publication,” he said.
Andrea Tsiachtsiri, OBG’s Country Director, added that she was delighted to have PwC’s team on board for The Report: Sri Lanka 2017.
“While growth inevitably produces growing pains, these are exciting times for Sri Lanka, with trade set to spike, an ambitious project pipeline taking shape and improved transport infrastructure helping to make logistical flows smoother,” she said. “PwC is a leading player in its field whose reputation, expertise and knowhow will go a long way to instilling confidence in investors. I’m thrilled that we will be working with its representatives and benefiting from their input.”
The Report: Sri Lanka 2017 will be a vital guide to the many facets of the country, including its macroeconomics, infrastructure, banking and other sectoral developments. The publication will also contain contributions from leading representatives, including President Maithripala Sirisena, Ranil Wickremesinghe, Sri Lanka’s prime minister, and Ban Ki-moon, former UN secretary-general. It will be available in print and online.
