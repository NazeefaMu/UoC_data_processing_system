Sri Lanka Insurance pays over 1,600 Suraksha claims for schoolchildren

The Suraksha Insurance scheme, which was launched by the Ministry of Education in October 2017, has already proved to be extremely beneficial for the children of Sri Lanka with over 1,600 claims already paid by Sri Lanka Insurance to date.
The scheme was introduced as a gift of Free Medical and Personal Accident Cover open to all Sri Lankan schoolchildren and is facilitated by Sri Lanka Insurance, which offers the service through its extensive network of 150 branches island-wide. The insurer has received over 4,300 insurance claims from schoolchildren during the last four months.
Suraksha consists of three main areas - Health Insurance, Personal Accident Insurance and Special Benefits – and covers all students between the ages of five and 19. Around 4.5 million schoolchildren from all walks of life studying in Government, private and international schools as well as student priests in Pirivenas are covered under this scheme. The scheme works on a reimbursement of payments basis.
The insurance cover includes surgical and hospitalisation benefits of Rs. 200,000 per annum as well as outdoor patients’ benefits worth Rs. 10,000 for seven selected ailments.
Further, there is a personal accident insurance benefit provided to both student and parents - Rs. 100,000 to be paid upon the sudden accidental death of the student as well as a cover worth Rs. 100,000 in the event of a total permanent disability and Rs. 50,000 to be paid upon partial permanent disability of the student. The insurance scheme also covers parents’ accidental death where a sum of Rs. 75,000 is paid to the student for such losses.
Suraksha beneficiaries are also entitled to additional benefits such as discounts on hospitalisation, discounts on consultants’ fees, etc.
Launched under the theme ‘Forever protect the children of the nation’, the Suraksha Insurance Scheme will assist in both the physical and mental well-being of all Sri Lankan children by ensuring financial assistance in case of illnesses, accidents and disabilities both in and out of school, ensuring uninterrupted education for children.
