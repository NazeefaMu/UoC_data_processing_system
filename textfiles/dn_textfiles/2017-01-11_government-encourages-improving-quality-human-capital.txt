Government encourages improving quality of human capital

The government encourages and appreciates all institutions dedicated to improve the quality of human capital, Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Minister John Amaratunga said.
National Human Resources Development Council (NHRDC) under the National Policies and Economic Affairs Ministry is a leading institute that facilitates and elevates the quality of community life, he said. Amarathunga made these comments at a workshop organised by the NHRDC on ‘Customer Care’ at the Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management yesterday. Customer care training specialist Dammika Kalapuge, addressing the workshop said economic development at the cost of values is not sustainable.
He said religious values, knowledge on history, art, culture and sensitivity to nature is important to develop a personality of an individual.
Kalapuge said, educational qualifications and titles following names will not create an individual with good personality, adding that positive communication and socio-cultural values are foundation for proper customer care.
