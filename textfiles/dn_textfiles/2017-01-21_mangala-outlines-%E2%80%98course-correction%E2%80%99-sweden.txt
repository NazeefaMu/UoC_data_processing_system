Mangala outlines ‘course correction’ in Sweden

Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera outlined the progress of the National Unity Government towards promoting reconciliation and building peace in Sri Lanka, at Stockholm’s Museum of Mediterranean and Near Eastern Antiquities on Wednesday.
The Sweden’s Institute for Security and Development Policy, along with the Sri Lankan Embassy, organised the talk.
“The set of actions that the government has identified to deal with the past in a comprehensive manner, addressing the grievances of all victims, include truth seeking, justice, reparation and measures for guaranteeing non-recurrence,” he said. “As a first step, we have enacted legislation to set up an Office on Missing Persons,” he said adding that plans for a Truth-Seeking Commission and a Reparations Office will soon be finalised.
He said civilian administration in the Northern and Eastern reaches of Sri Lanka has been restored, and that the government is taking steps to establish the equality of all citizens. After noting that the island had squandered its chance to develop due to the civil conflict, the Minister said the government was working hard to make up for lost time.
“We repealed the 18th Amendment to the Constitution and adopted the 19th Amendment, which reintroduced the two-term limit of the Presidency, reduced the term of the Presidency from six to five years, established a constitutional council, and recognised the right to information as a fundamental right,” he said.
He highlighted the importance of drafting a new Constitution.
“As an important measure to prevent recurrence of conflict, Parliament, last year, unanimously adopted a Resolution for Parliament to sit as a Constitutional Assembly to draft a new Constitution,” he said.
Samaraweera focused on economic matters as well, telling the audience that Sri Lanka has a good chance of gaining GSP+ status while also highlighting its infrastructural developments.
“The government’s plan of making Sri Lanka an Indian Ocean hub are beginning to bear fruit; the Colombo international financial city; the Hambantota, Colombo East and Trincomalee ports; and the Katunayake and Palali airports are all hives of activity,” he said.
Samaraweera said the country is working to reestablish diplomatic relations with the outside world. He mentioned the strong ties between Sweden and Sri Lanka as evidenced by Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstöm’s 2016 visit.
