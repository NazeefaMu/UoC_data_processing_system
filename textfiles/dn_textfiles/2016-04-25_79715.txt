Kaushal Silva knocked unconscious

Sri Lanka Test opener Kaushal Silva was knocked out stone cold during a two-day practice match played at Pallekele Stadium yesterday when he was hit on the back of his head by a ball while fielding at his customary position at short leg.
The incident took place during the practice match played by the national squad players preparing for next month’s tour to England.
Silva suffered the injury when team member Dinesh Chandimal swept a ball from spinner Tharindu Kaushal. Silva fielding at short leg although taking evasive action was hit on the back of his head and collapsed on the field.
“Kaushal was unconscious and he had to be taken on a stretcher and rushed to the Kandy General Hospital,” said team manager Charith Senanayake.
“A head scan was done and the neuro surgeon said that there was nothing to be alarmed about and that he was out of danger.
“However we transferred Kaushal to Colombo where he is presently being treated at the Nawaloka Hospital,” he said. Senanayake said that Silva was wearing the latest helmet that came into the market with protection at the back of his neck and that may have probably saved him from any serious injury. The protective helmet was introduced following the death of former Australian cricketer Phil Hughes who died after being hit behind his ear while batting during a Sheffield Shield match in November 2014. Silva had on the first day of the two-day game scored a century and was fielding yesterday when the incident happened.
