Mobitel demonstrates 5G with commercial infrastructure at Techno 2018

Mobitel, Sri Lanka’s National Mobile Service Provider once again led Sri Lanka’s Technological and Digital advancements at Techno 2018. Sri Lanka’s premier Technology Exhibition showcased the country’s Engineering and Technology prowess, was energized and inspired by Mobitel’s dazzling demonstration of cutting-edge Communication Services made available for the betterment of all Sri Lankans.
Technology enthusiasts flocked to Mobitel’s attractive stall which featured a range of its latest unique products, technologies, initiatives and innovations under the theme ‘Connecting the green future’ which was aligned to Techno 2018’s green engineering ethos. Mobitel and Sri Lanka Telecom stepped forward as main sponsors for Techno 2018, which was held from October 12 to 14, 2018 at the BMICH.
Mobitel’s stall was unique on many fronts. Taking its ‘Connecting the green future’ theme to heart, the state-of-the-art stall was designed using recyclable material to the greatest extent possible. Moreover, the stall was highly interactive and engaging for visitors because Mobitel held demonstrations of its latest technologies, initiatives and innovations.
Leading the way in 5G in Sri Lanka, Mobitel publicly demonstrated Sri Lanka’s first 5G deployment over 3.5GHz, globally recognized as the primary frequency band for 5G, showcasing the exponential growth in broadband speeds which Mobitel will provide to its customers in the near future. This 5G Massive MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) technology demonstration utilized 64x64 MIMO configuration with commercially available user devices and commercially available network equipment, dispelling doubts over its short term viability, and thereby leading Sri Lanka’s progress ahead of many technology advanced nations worldwide. Mobitel is grateful for the support and encouragement given by the Director General of Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) and his officers to industry players in their efforts in making advancements in the industry.
Sri Lanka’s national mobile service provider, Mobitel, occupies the foremost position in cutting-edge mobile telecommunication technology in Sri Lanka. Its revolutionary path to the forefront of the industry is peppered with many pioneering technologies that have paved the way for other mobile operators to follow in its wake. In fact, the rest of the industry takes its cue from products and services introduced by Mobitel. Trail-blazing 5G in Sri Lanka having demonstrated 5G with commercial infrastructure at Techno 2018, Mobitel is poised to be the first mobile operator in Sri Lanka to introduce 5G commercially for its customers for faster connectivity and an improved experience.
Despite being the first off the starting blocks with every mobile technology in the recent past, Mobitel, never loses sight of offering sustainable ‘green’ technology offerings that nurture the nation. While Mobitel has the capability to roll out the very latest mobile technologies, at the same time, it lends a nurturing hand to its customer base in rural areas for whom 2G and 3G technologies are a lifeline. Mobitel understands the needs of its customer segments and caters to them with unfailing precision, while ensuring its investments in the latest technologies continue to enhance the reputation of Sri Lanka as being highly advanced in the region for technological adoption.
Mobitel also publicly demonstrated Voice-over-WiFi (VoWiFi) for the first time in Sri Lanka, the ability to make traditional cellular voice calls over any WiFi hotspot. This is a significant step forward in Sri Lanka, as typical voice calls will be possible in areas of extremely poor Mobile coverage or ‘Not Spots’ (where owing to environmental conditions or the inability for Mobile signals to penetrate very large buildings), calls can be routed over any available WiFi hotspot.
Having showcased services geared towards the masses, Mobitel also demonstrated communication services suitable for public/administrative services and large scale industries such as Police and Emergency services, Shipping, Railway communications etc. The technology was based on converting traditional analog ‘Walkie-Talkie’ services over Mobitel’s island-wide digital LTE network, thereby ensuring enhanced coverage, superior call quality, and also the ability to broadcast video images over push-to-talk (PTT) functions. Following the recent natural disasters in Sri Lanka, Mobitel also trialed an early warning detection system for landslides, thereby encompassing communication from early warning systems to emergency response units.
Furthermore, to cater the growth of Internet of Things (IoT) deployment, Mobitel also demonstrated several NB-IoT (Narrowband IoT) products such as Smart Water Meters.
Finally, in keeping with the Green Technology theme, an app based on the widely popular blockchain technology was commercially launched, whereby anyone could plant a tree and track its growth over its lifetime, thereby earning carbon credits which could be traded for free data bundles on Mobitel’s network.
Mobitel CEO, Nalin Perera said, “Mobitel’s 3-pronged initiative which improved the lifestyle and digital empowerment of 1) its retail customers, 2) the public services/ large scale industries and finally 3) pioneering Sri Lanka’s Sustainable and Green initiatives based on its technology service offerings and acknowledged the support extended by the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of Sri Lanka for the creating the right environment for the growth and sustainability of the industry. Mobitel had once again delivered real-life solutions with tangible benefits to every Sri Lankan and also for advancing Sri Lanka’s digital initiatives, in keeping with Sri Lanka’s digital vision for the country.”
