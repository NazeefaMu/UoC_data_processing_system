International recognition for SL’s reconciliation efforts affected - Sajith

The international recognition received by Sri Lanka for the progress it has made in reconciliation efforts was severely affected by the recent racial and religious conflicts fabricated by power-hungry politicians, Minister Sajith Premadasa said yesterday. “These power-hungry elements trigger and exploit such racial and religious conflicts in order to open up a shortcut to get back into Temple Trees or President’s House,” he said.
The Housing and Construction Minister made these observations at a ceremony to hand over the Helasihagama model village to the public. This model village was established at a cost of Rs. 15.6 million as a part of the government’s ‘Uda Gammana Model Village Programme’.
Minister Premadasa said that some groups who call themselves patriots are burning down houses for their personal political gain instead of building houses. “They fabricate racial and religious conflicts. They burn down shops and religious places. The international and nongovernmental organizations are not attacking our war heroes thanks to our government’s policies. We did not achieve such recognition with a hostile approach; instead, we relied on our well-thought out foreign policies. Our achievement is jeopardized by these conflicts forged by some groups who attempt to fulfill their political needs. They are trying to turn this country into a burning hellhole. Do you remember Black July in 1983? How much did we lose from that afterwards?” he asked. Minister Premadasa pointed out that Sri Lanka lost an agreement signed with a donor organisation from the Middle East which was willing to assist 2.5 million homeless families. The agreement was to provide housing loan facilities and aid to these people. However, following the tense situation recently in Kandy, the organisation called off the agreement.
“We not only lost human lives and property, we also lost potential donors and investors who are willing to work with us. Why are these groups doing this? They don’t do this to protect their race or religion, but to succeed in their personal agendas,” Minister Premadasa stated.
He said that there definitely is an invisible hand behind the deaths, acts of violence, and burglaries reported in the country. Referring to this movement to forge ethnic and religious tension among communities to be a national conspiracy, Minister Premadasa further said, “These persons have expert knowledge in starting brawls.”
“If they are Buddhists, they should not destroy, but build temples and Dhamma schools in villages. But they cannot get votes by doing so.”
“I have personal experience from Hambantota with regard to that. They build up their vote base by triggering ethnic and religious conflicts.”
The Minister urged all communities to carry the country forward leaving all animosities behind.
