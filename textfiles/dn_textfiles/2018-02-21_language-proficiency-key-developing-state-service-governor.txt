Language proficiency, key to developing state service - Governor

Sabaragamuwa Provincial Governor Marshal Perera said that language proficiency is among the key features required for the development of state service.
He said so while offering diploma certificates to state officers, who followed the Tamil and English language proficiency diploma courses at the ‘Training and Development Centre for Management’ at Pussella, Ratnapura recently.
In line with the state language policy, two English and Tamil language proficiency diploma programmes are conducted by the Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council for state officers who are serving in the Sabaragamuwa Provincial Service aiming to improve the productivity of provincial service while strengthening the ethnic harmony.
Each diploma programme, which being conducted through a year receives a huge demand from the state officers. Of the huge number of applicants, 48 officers had been selected to follow the first batch of two diploma programmes.
