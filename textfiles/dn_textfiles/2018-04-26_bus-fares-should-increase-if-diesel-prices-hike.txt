Bus fares should increase if diesel prices hike

 
Bus fares should increase by Rs. 1 if the price of diesel increases by Rs. 5 according to the price formula, the All Ceylon Private Bus Owner’s Association said.
Private bus owners as a whole are in grave financial crisis since the value of the dollar is increasing relative to the rupee day by day, Chief Secretary of the Private Bus Owner’s Association Anjana Priyanjitha said.
Taking this to account the government should take measures to increase bus fares, the President of the Association added.
