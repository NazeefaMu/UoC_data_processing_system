Salman to launch Mouni Roy in Bollywood?

Man with a heart of gold, superstar Salman Khan, is reportedly set to transform yet another life. After launching talents like Sneha Ullal, Daisy Shah, Zarine Khan, Athiya Shetty, Sonakshi Sinha, the ‘Dabangg’ star is reportedly all set to launch television star Mouni Roy.
The actress, who features as the female lead in daily soaps like ‘Naagin’ and ‘Naagin 2’, has met Salman a couple of times on the sets of ‘Bigg Boss’.
A report in DNA says that the superstar has seen the same amount of calibre and potential in Mouni as Sonakshi Sinha. Sonakshi was launched in his brother Arbaaz Khan’s 2010 blockbuster ‘Dabangg’ and is now an established star herself.
If the news is true, this Bollywood debut will prove to be the biggest turning point in the actress’s career. Buzz is that Mouni may get to star in the same film Bhai is already in talks with Sidharth Malhotra for.
A Bollywood film with one of the hottest stars, dream debut!
The petite actress has acted in several shows- Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi, Devon Ke Dev - Mahadev and Junoon - Aisi Nafrat Toh Kaisa Ishq- and is quite a rage on social media. No confirmation on this news has come yet but we truly hope this crossover happens for this deserving lady. Deccan Chroncile
