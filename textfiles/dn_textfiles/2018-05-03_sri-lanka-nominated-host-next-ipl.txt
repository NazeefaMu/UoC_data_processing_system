Sri Lanka nominated to host next IPL

 
The India Premier League was nominated to be held in Sri Lanka next year.
The venue was decided to be shifted due to the upcoming elections in India.
The United Arab Emirates and South Africa also agreed to host the event but the Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) said that Sri Lanka has won more preference over other counties.
