AIA Vitality partners HSBC GSC for cancer walk

AIA Vitality partnered with HSBC Global Service Centre in Sri Lanka for a Cancer Walk, organized for HSBC employees and their families.
The walk was in aid of collecting donations for the Cancer Hospital in Colombo. This partnership came on the heels of AIA’s successful partnership with the ‘Run for Their Lives’ (RFTL) charity intended at encouraging AIA Vitality members to contribute towards the Apeksha Cancer Hospital in Maharagama.
These are all AIA Vitality’s efforts to help and raise awareness on Cancer and such NCD’s, which is a growing concern in Sri Lanka and are a main cause of deaths in the country.
AIA Vitality is committed to not only encouraging Sri Lankans to be more active and lead a healthier lifestyle but also allows them to give back to the community. AIA continues to partner with leading corporates in Sri Lanka to promote health and wellness as part of the greater effort to help people live healthier, longer and better lives.
