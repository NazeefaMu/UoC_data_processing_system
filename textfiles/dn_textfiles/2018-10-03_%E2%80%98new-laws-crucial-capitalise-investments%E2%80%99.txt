Digitisation of state institutions
‘New laws crucial to  capitalise on investments’

The introduction of digital laws is crucial to capitalise on investments made by the government to digitise state institutions, Digital Infrastructure and Foreign Employment Minister Harin Fernando said.
He was addressing the media during a meeting held at Sirikotha, yesterday.
Minister Fernando added that digital infrastructure platforms had already been established at most state institutions; however, institutions had shown reluctance to adopt those methods. It was imperative that the all state institutions adhered to the system, he added.
“Some institutions said they would like to establish their own digital systems, while some did not want to adhere to it. Due to these weaknesses in adaptation, the process has been delayed,” the minister said.
“The government has made significant investments for this process. If we are to reap the benefits of it, it is important that we introduce digital laws. The Digital Infrastructure Ministry should be given the power to implement it. When state institutions, by law, are required to adhere to the digitisation process, its implementation would be fruitful,” Minister Fernando added.
Taking India as an example, Minister Fernando highlighted that the portfolio of Law and Order, Judiciary and Digital infrastructure was held by a single minister.
“When the Indian Digital infrastructure Minister visited Sri Lanka, I had a discussion with him regarding the issues we have. It was clear that coordination was easier when the same minister held the judiciary and the digital infrastructure portfolios,” the minister said.
The concept of digitisation was still new to Sri Lanka, particularly to the state sector, he said and added that it was necessary to encourage the use of modern methods.
