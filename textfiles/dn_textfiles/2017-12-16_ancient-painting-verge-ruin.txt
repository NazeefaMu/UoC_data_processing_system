Ancient painting on the verge of ruin

A Buddha statue and a series of precious wall-paintings belonging to the Kandyan era in the shrine room of the Eheliyagoda Sri Madarasingharamaya temple are on the verge of being destroyed.
Although these paintings and the Buddha statue were restored to some extent by the Archaeology Department earlier, the walls of the shrine room is decaying rapidly and prior to restoration, rain water had leaked onto the paintings further aggravating the situation.
Ratnapura District Secondary Sangha Nayake, Ven. Pohorabawe Wimalatissa Thera and Madarasingharamaya Temple Chief Sangha Nayake, the Ven. Wiyalagoda Assaji Thera said in order to protect these 400-year-old valuable paintings for the future generation, steps should be taken to remedy the situation without further delay.
