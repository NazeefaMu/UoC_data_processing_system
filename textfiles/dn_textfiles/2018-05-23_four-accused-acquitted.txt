Mattegoda murder:
Four accused acquitted

Panadura Provincial High Court Judge Dhamith Thotawatte concluding the Mattegoda Salgashandiya murder case yesterday, acquitted the accused without calling their defence.
Pronouncing the judgement, the judge stated that the prosecution had failed to prove the charges against the four accused, indicted by the Attorney General with committing the murder of Ranil Krishantha Gamage of Mattegoda on September 23, 2007.
The judge also directed State Counsel Samantha Piyasena to file a plaint against two witnesses Nalin Chamira Perera and Dinesh Indunil for giving false evidence before court in connection with the murder of Gamage.
The judge acquitted Don Samantha S. Weeratunge, K.P. Pradeep Kumara Perera, Weeratunge Arachchige Priyantha M Sugith and Asoka Gunasinghe of Mattegoda.
President Counsel U.R. De Silva defending the accused, stated that there was a struggle between two parties at Salgashandiya on the night of the incident, but there was no evidence before court to confirm that these accused had committed the murder of the deceased.
