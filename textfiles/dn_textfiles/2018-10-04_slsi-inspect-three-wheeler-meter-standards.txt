SLSI to inspect three-  wheeler meter standards

The Civil Aviation and Transport Ministry has decided to suspend fixing meters to three-wheelers till the standards of the three-wheel meters are ascertained by the Sri Lanka Standards Institution.
The Ministry, issuing a press release, said Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva made the above decision during a meeting with members of three-wheel drivers’ associations at the ministry premises, yesterday.
“The Government cannot get the expected outcome if there are questions on the standards of the meters. I will ask the SLSI to look into this matter. Until the SLSI issues standard certificates to the meters, the law that makes it compulsory for all three-wheels to have meters will not be implemented,” the release said quoting the minister.
The Minister was also adamant that the age limit of 35-75years to be qualified to obtain a license to drive a public service three-wheel must remain.
He pointed out that the age limit contributes to the safety of the three-wheel industry.
The minister also said that a national policy to regulate the country’s three-wheel industry has already been drafted.
