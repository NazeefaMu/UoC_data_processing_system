Welcome move to restrict car imports - Minister

Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said more items will be added to the list of restricted imports in the future.
He commended the Finance Ministry decision to restrict vehicle imports and some other non-essential items. Samarasinghe said that the Finance Ministry has taken this decision to ease the pressure on the Rupee. Public and government officers also have been using their permits which have been issued. But there are more awaiting to obtain permits.
“When a decision is taken, you have to make it applicable to all. So whether politicians have taken their vehicle permits or not, when you announce a policy decision like that, it must be applicable to everyone,” the Minister said.
