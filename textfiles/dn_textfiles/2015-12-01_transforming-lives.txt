Transforming lives

Teleseen Marketing (Pvt) Ltd., pioneers in introducing European innovative products to the local market, recently celebrated its 20th Anniversary at Cinnamon Grand Hotel, Colombo. It all started from modest beginnings, with just two staff members and one dealer. However, today they enjoy remarkable success as a well established business in South Asia.
In addition to their head office based in Dehiwela, the company has branches in Bambalapitiya, Watthala, Negambo, Battaramulla, Galle, Kandy, Kiribathgoda, Matara and Panadura. Teleseen Marketing's commitment to render a better service has been further assured with the launch of a call center and new systems that operate 365 days, with 12 hour service and islandwide delivery networks.
In a stage where Sri Lanka is on the path to further progress and positive change, Teleseen is committed to contribute to this change through initiatives that will significantly transform the lives of people.
Here are some memorable moments of the company's 20th anniversary celebrations underway.
