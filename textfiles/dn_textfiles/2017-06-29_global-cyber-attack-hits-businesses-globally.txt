Global cyber attack hits businesses globally

A massive ransomware attack has hit businesses around the world, causing major companies to shut down their computer systems.
Researchers are still investigating the software behind the attack, warning that it’s more sophisticated than the WannaCry worm that struck hundreds of thousands of computers across the globe last month.
“WannaCry was a tremendous failure. It was a lot of noise, very little money, and everyone noticed it,” said Craig Williams, an expert at cybersecurity firm Cisco Talos. “What we’re seeing today is a much more intelligent worm.”
Big global brands like Mondelez (MDLZ), the maker of Oreos, and British advertising giant WPP (WPPGF) say their IT systems are experiencing problems.
The ransomware infects computers and locks down their hard drives. It demands a $300 ransom in the anonymous digital currency Bitcoin.
The email account associated with the ransomware has been blocked, so even if victims pay, they won’t get their files back.
Law enforcement and cybersecurity experts agree that victims should never pay ransoms for such attacks. (CNN)
