Media banned from Mannar ‘grave site’

The Mannar Magistrate's Court yesterday issued an order preventing foreign and local journalists from entering the area near the CWE outlet in Mannar where a mass grave was found.
The court issued this order as entry of media personnel to this site may hamper the investigation process. The Mannar Magistrate has prohibited journalists from entering,videoing or taking pictures or interviewing officials.
