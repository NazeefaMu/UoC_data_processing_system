Fire cracker manufacturers left high and dry

The fire cracker manufacturers in the Southern province have been greatly inconvenienced as a result of the rising cost of explosives and raw materials. They said this situation arose as a result of the imposing of VAT on explosives and raw materials.
A large scale fire cracker manufacture said there is a big demand for fire crackers during the festive season but the manufacturers are unable to cater to the demand due to the rising cost of explosives and raw materials.
He said a pack of explosives that fetched Rs. 8,500 has now risen to Rs.10,750.
