Former left arm leggie Jayaweera in town

Former Thurstan and Saracens left arm leg spinner who met with success for his school and club is in town with his charming wife Prasani on a short holiday from Sydney, Australia.
Jayaweera sported Thurstan College colours from 1971 to 1973. He met with amazing success in the 1973 season capturing a record 68 wickets with his biting left arm spin that had all opposing batsman bewildered. In 1973 he had the Maliyadeva College, Krunegala batsmen in a flat spin pocketing a match bag of 11 for 119 with some rarely seen high class bowling.
After a highly successful school cricket season, he joined the Rifle Green Club Saracens where under former all rounders Ralston Burke and Percy Perera he continued his success. Burke was an old Kandy Antonian and Perera an Old Benedictine who was in addition a classy basketball player who was adjudged the Best Shooter in Asia Games Basketball tournament in 1966.
Jayaweera speaks highly of Burke who he says was one of the best off spinning all rounders of that era.
He was a hard hitting right hand batsman and a cunning off spinner. Perera he said was a fine paceman who could swing the ball both ways and packed a vicious bouncer. Jayantha is the brother of the illustrious Sunil Jayaweera and Indrani. Indrani is married to former 800 metre Ceylon record holder and Old Benedictine Prasad Perera. Indrani was a former 400 metre Ceylon record holder. Sunil needs no introduction to sportsmen and sports fans in the country as a sportsman and top class administrator. Jayantha Jayaweera is a British qualified Civil Engineer by profession and has been living in Sydney, Australia since 1989.
It was nice meeting Jayaweera and talking of old times, especially cricket where every player enjoyed the game because it was played in the best of spirits.
When asked about Sri Lanka cricket he said that the cricketers have talent, but was sad to note that they lacked determination and commitment. ER
