UAE’s Lulu Group aids flood relief efforts

The UAE-based retail giant Lulu Group has donated an amount of US$100,000 (Dh367,000) to the National Floods and Landslide Victims Operation in Sri Lanka to support flood relief and rescue operations after floods wreaked havoc in Sri Lanka recently.
Sri Lankan Ambassador to the UAE S.J. Mohideen received the cheque from Yusuf Ali MA, chairman of Lulu, in Abu Dhabi in the presence of senior officials of the Lulu Group and Sri Lankan Embassy at a function held at its head office in Abu Dhabi.
After handing over the cheques, Yusuf Ali said: “UAE has always been and is at the forefront in helping needy people worldwide and we have always supported the philanthropic initiatives launched by the visionary rulers of this great country. We are currently witnessing the ‘Year of Giving 2017’ initiative declared by UAE President Shaikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, which further instills the value of giving and the importance of lending a helping hand to the disadvantaged people across the world.”
Receiving the cheque, Ambassador S.J. Mohideen thanked the Lulu Group for its gesture. “This natural calamity is one of the worst disasters in the history of Sri Lanka that resulted in the loss of a number of lives and property. The world community has responded by supporting the people of Sri Lanka with an open heart and this noble gesture by the Lulu Group is much appreciated and accepted with gratitude by the people of Sri Lanka,” said S.J. Mohideen.
