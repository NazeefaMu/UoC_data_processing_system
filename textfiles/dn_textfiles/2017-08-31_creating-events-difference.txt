Creating events with a  difference

Paramount Event Spaces are elegant venues with helpful and knowledgeable staff, ready to assist you in making the memories of a lifetime. Their contemporary design and customization options make them a premier venue for trainings, business events, and other celebrations. The venue is chic and charming, with flexible policies and state of the art technology and amenities
With the launch of their brand-new spaces in the heart of Nawala, Paramount Event Spaces has been getting numerous bookings including advance bookings for the year end events. The company is all about value for money when it comes to providing unparalleled customer service and a versatile and beautiful venue for events.

“The Melomanic sessions utilizes unique spaces around Colombo and its suburbs to create the best ambience for local musicians to present their music at. The roof top of the Paramount Tower hence was ideal for the 29th Melomanic Sessions as it is located very centrally in Nawala with ample parking, but with enough seclusion to feel one is not really in an urban area. The event manager from Paramount Event Spaces was supportive and had a firm grasp of our requirements. All in all, Melo was a success, and the audience was pleased with the experience. We definitely will be back,” said Co - Founder, Melomanic Sessions.C C de Silva in a press release.
Commenting on their training programme which took place at the indoor space of Paramount Event Spaces, Upendra Arjeewani, RECP Expert & Consultant at the National Cleaner Production Centre said “It was a nice experience to have our programme at the new event venue of Paramount Realty. I highly appreciate the support and service they provided us throughout the programme to make it a success.”
