DEMOCRACY AND CONSCIENCE OF PEOPLE AND LEADERS

It is Sri Lanka’s experience, that all the Presidents, and many authorities responsible for judicial decisions, administration and financial transactions of public and private institutions have in many instances acted arbitrarily, according to their erroneous, flawed desires and corrupt whims and fancies. The people demanding the abolition of the presidency – the highest state authority – is a consequence of Sri Lanka’s degeneration to an abjectly rotten political, socio-economic culture and of serious exercises of irresponsibility. It is a sign of their alienation from the people. Sri Lanka needs saving from such a calamitous situation.
In the final analysis, the problem of creating space for a stable democracy does not depend only on a form of government, a presidential or parliamentary or a particular economic system. It depends on those vested with responsibility critically evaluating social reality and understanding and acting creatively with a good conscience. Confronted with a huge debt and critical financial situation the government should be frugal in expenditure and not engage in self-serving. It should stop importing duty-free vehicles for MPs, withhold increasing their salaries and bring about a new dynamic social reality according to a progressive agenda that is people oriented and open to their support.
All citizens are vested with responsibility, proportionately. Those who have been endowed with more need to contribute more by bearing greater responsibility to sensitize everyone. To lead all to discern the truth of the unhealthy social reality, help decide prudently, act in a disciplined manner according to conscience are acts of lively understanding and intelligence. Leaders need to assist and urge people to recover their conscience. No one could choose to do what is right and proper without a prudent conscience.
Good conscience
Consciences get formed from one’s young days at home and school. Under the guidance of parents and teachers the young mature in their discerning and good consciences bud forth. ‘Formation’ is a development in which the interior, the most precious ‘within’ of a human being progresses towards a self-creation and an ongoing maturation and integrity and a wholesomeness of growth enabling him to deliberate, reason, understand, judge, decide and act freely, justly, fairly and independently of the vacillating opinion of others. Yet, as attractive contrary desires interpose, acting according to the dictates of a good conscience is indeed challenging. Those with a formed character are consistently successful. Formation of character is the function of parents and teachers. An education system that is indifferent to character formation is next to useless.
If the limp in the limb is not set right when a child is young, it will persist even in maturity. So, when for any reason the formation of a sensitive conscience of the young has been defective, whatever they became – clergymen, teachers, nurses, policemen, ministers, Supreme Court judges, heads of state– they carry with them the predominant orientation of their badly formed consciences and make decisions with them. Just as the limping man knows his walk is crooked, the man acting with a disoriented conscience also knows he is crooked. Those with power without a good conscience are like a brigade of activated mindless robots handling complex lethal weapons. Public men with deformed consciences are worse than plagues.
So, when the one responsible politically or otherwise,
* only engages in the interplay of political forces, disregards the rule of law and along with it human rights, justice and fairness and exercises or succumbs to raw political power and gets away with it,
* denies the human rights of a vast number of people belonging to a racial or religious minority,
* denies the language rights and educational rights of a vast number of people belonging to an ethnic minority,
* deprives the children of the underprivileged people the opportunity to learn English while his children and those of his close supporters are assured of every opportunity,
* dispossesses people of their lands and houses for public works and leaves them in the lurch,
* supports the expropriation without compensation of the properties of individuals and groups?
* enviously and vindictively supports the expropriation of the denominational schools ‘to bring the Catholic Church to its knees’ as one of that leader’s Cabinet ministers sneeringly put it, not knowing perhaps that at worship the Catholic Church is more on its knees than any other community,
* becomes spiteful of the Judiciary and grants to a condemned criminal amnesty and honours to reward him,
* receives gifts of vast sums of money given by foreign government and social organisations to help the distressed and banks the money in his private account earning interest too,
* abuses state resources - movable and immovable properties and financial resources without any check, and is not held to account for the dishonest expenditure,
* hires fleets of buses from the government transport board for election purposes and fails to settle the bill,
* openly engages in nepotism and promotes his own kith and kin and friends ensconcing them in high positions despite their lacking decent qualifications,
* supports those engaged in drug trafficking and protects wrongdoers from arrest, disregarding the law and deadening the agencies of the law,
* does not treat all citizens as equal but favours a particular group and unjustly discriminates against others,
* disdains the law and obstructs its application to favour political loyalists,
* pressurizes all his political partisans to abandon their own conscience and vote to prolong his rule?
* involves the country in huge debts and lets his supportive friends, kith and kin to make huge gains corruptly at the cost of the country,
* mortgages the country’s future beyond his lifetime and leaves its onus to future generations,
* condones ministers who use their positions to distribute houses and vehicles at government expense to relatives and political supporters,
* makes solemn promises witnessed by multitudes and reneges on them, and creates tension between racial and religious groups as a vote catching devise,
* remains blind to matters such as these and displays a foolish self-righteous stubbornness,
It cannot be said that such national leaders and those responsible have acted with a good conscience. They have acted with evil and dishonest intent. They are aware of it. Belatedly a few have admitted to have made ‘mistakes’ – mistakes that have cost the country dearly. Others are far too arrogant to admit. The root cause of all the intractable problems of our country in the public and private sector is the far from desirable upright condition of the consciences of our people and of those vested with authority who act arbitrarily and in corrupt ways. Political leaders pass all manner of unjust and unfair laws to suit their narrow and selfish purposes. Unjust laws are no laws at all, said St. Augustine of Hippo, over sixteen centuries ago!
Constitutions and law updating are important; but they achieve precious little without persons of reliable conscience. Though the link between democracy and conscience may seem tenuous, conscience is the guarantor of democracy. We cannot be a civilized people if we are without a decent conscience. It is all the more reason to plan and systematically put into effect a way to form and strengthen consciences. This is possible. If there is a will there is a way. If such a plan is duly carried out, satanic forces roaming this land will be thrust down to the hell fire where they belong.
National leaders
There are many citizens, learned, experts in their own fields who are honest and clear headed and know what reforms Sri Lanka needs. They know what and how things should be done. As they are not in power to do so, they should get mobilized and even persuade those in power to a moral conversion and sincerely cooperate to remake Sri Lanka. Though for selfish reasons they may hesitate, the overwhelming decency of conscientious people will induce them to mend their ways or step aside.
The new team of national leaders especially should be a clear headed sharers of a common vision who could lead the people as a shepherd leads his whole flock to more verdant pastures. Jewish people called their kings and rulers shepherds. The Leader sets the tune for all vested with responsibility. It is high time we had a national leader with a good conscience who is sustained by supporters of rectitude and acts fearlessly, courageously and impartially and could speak frankly and forthrightly to the whole Nation and lead her honourably with a sense of justice and fairness and respect for all the citizens, upholding the best traditions of democracy. Such a leader will not only be a bulwark of truth and justice and a boon to all the people of the country, he will also be a beacon of light and one to be emulated by the young, the blessings and traditions of conscientious leadership should be passed from generation to generation for many years to come. An undesirable rotten tradition has lasted a few decades, a purified tradition could replace it with the support of the people.
