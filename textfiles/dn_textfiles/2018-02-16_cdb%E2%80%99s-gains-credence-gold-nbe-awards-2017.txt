CDB’s gains credence with Gold at NBE Awards 2017

Citizens Development Business Finance (CDB) gained credence for its strategic path winning a Gold Award in the NBFI sector for the second consecutive year and a Merit for Excellence in Performance Management at the recently concluded National Business Excellence Awards 2017.
The Awards, organised annually by the National Chamber of Commerce is now in its 14th year. The chief guest was the Canadian High Commissioner David McKinnon.
CDB’s brand of business excellence is now legendary. Throughout its over twenty year history, this is a financial entity that has striven to set benchmarks for the industry, not only instilling stringent compliance and governance measures into its operations, but also state of the art technological solutions into its innovative product portfolio and promoting good corporate citizenry into its DNA.
The Company’s financial results prove repeatedly that its focus on the triple bottom line has brought with it sustainable results that continue to break records within the NBFI sector.
“Being recognised by an awards scheme that is today known as the symbol of excellence for the ‘best of the best’ business in Sri Lanka is truly an honour for CDB,” says MD and CEO Mahesh Nanayakkara, explaining the symbolism of the trophy depicting a lotus in bloom. “This award illustrates how we at CDB surmounted immense challenges to climb to the zenith and be recognised for our achievements, just as the lotus rises tall and strong from the depths of the water.” “Our business mission and values are totally stakeholder driven and this I believe is our formula for success,” explains Nanayakkara of the multi-award winning entity he spearheads. “The fact that the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing, Brand Finance and Sri Lanka Institute of Training and Development among many, have all repeatedly recognised CDB for its achievements speaks for the benchmarks we set in business excellence. We have an unrelenting focus on innovation and have infused technology into this equation to avail our customers of pioneering products and services.”
