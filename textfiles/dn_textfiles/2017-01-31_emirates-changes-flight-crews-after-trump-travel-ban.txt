Emirates changes flight crews after Trump travel ban

Dubai carrier Emirates said it has adjusted its crews for flights to the United States following President Donald Trump’s travel ban on people from seven predominantly Muslim countries.
The new president faced mass protests and global outrage over the controversial bar on travellers from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, as around 300 people were stopped or detained worldwide en route to the US.
“We have made the necessary adjustments to our crewing, to comply with the latest requirements,” a statement from Emirates said.
The carrier added that no staff member had yet been affected by the travel restrictions and stressed that all flights to the US were operating as scheduled.
