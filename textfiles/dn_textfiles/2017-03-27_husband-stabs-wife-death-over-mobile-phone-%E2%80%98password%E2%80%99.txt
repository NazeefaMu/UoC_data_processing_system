Husband stabs wife to death over mobile phone ‘password’

 An altercation between a husband and wife over a password of a mobile phone cost the life of the wife with the husband ending up in hospital struggling between life and death.
Renuka Malkanthi (39) of Dapiligoda, Agalawatta, a mother of a 12-year-old daughter was an astrologer by profession and had lived happily with her husband for the past 13 years.
March 23 was just another usual day for them. Malkanthi’s husband, who was getting ready to attend a neighbour’s funeral, had taken the wife’s mobile phone to speak to a friend and found difficulty in operating it since the wife had entered a ‘pass word’.
When the husband inquired about the password, she had retorted angrily and this had led to a scuffle between the couple.
The irate husband had seized a knife and stabbed Malkanthi on three places killing her. The husband repenting over his action taken on sudden provocation thought of ending his own life and gulped down a bottle of weedicide to commit suicide. Neighbours who heard the commotion had rushed to the scene and prevented him from ending his life.
The husband who was rushed to hospital is in a critical condition struggling between life and death.
The postmortem examination was held yesterday.
