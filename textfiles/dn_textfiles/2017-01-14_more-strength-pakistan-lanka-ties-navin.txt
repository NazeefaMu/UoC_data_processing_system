More strength for Pakistan, Lanka ties: Navin

Pakistan and Sri Lanka have been maintaining strong and long standing ties, Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake said.
He said the relationship between the two countries was getting stronger day by day.
"Even though the two countries maintain a cordial relationship in many sectors it is important to note that economic and trade relationship are vital. The Pakistan economy is the second largest economy in the South Asian region, the minister said.
He said the relationship had not reached its peak and much could be done.
The political stability of both countries and the peaceful atmosphere from 2009 in Sri Lanka is the foundation stone for strengthening economic and trade relationships further, the minister said as the Chief Guest at Pakistan Trade Fair at the BMICH yesterday.
