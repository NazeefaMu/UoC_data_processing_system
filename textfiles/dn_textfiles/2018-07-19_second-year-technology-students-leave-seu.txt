Second-year Technology students leave SEU

Second-year students attached to the South Eastern University’s (SEU) Technological Studies Faculty, had decided to leave the university and come down to Colombo, a spokesman for the Oluvil Technological Faculty Students’ Collective said. The decision was taken because the South Eastern University administration had failed to mete out justice to students during the past year, he said.
He said they had to cancel a lunch hour protest to be staged with the participation of first-year students on July 17 as the administration locked the gates, preventing them from leaving during the lunch hour.
The university administration had also prepared to take disciplinary action against 21 Technological Faculty students on July 17.
A group of students had lodged complaints with the police, alleging that the University’s security personnel had arrived at the scene armed with clubs and other equipment to remove the students.
They alleged that disciplinary action had been taken against the said students because they planned to conduct a bodhi pooja pinkama with the first-year students.
