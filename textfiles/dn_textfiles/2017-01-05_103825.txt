Natural flair and living your skills!

Let me kick off this edition of our regular Thursday yards with a warm ...'hug-us maximus' to all rugby hearts for an inspired new season, infused with strength, wellness, belief and much natural instinct.
The island game has certainly provided its share of exception and amazement in round 1 ...but 2017 has been far more predictable with Havelocks, Navy and Kandy holding their rankings from 2016…and tantalizingly with 40, 40, 39 - not a stat that will please either camp or coach at Havelock Park, Welisara or Nittawela?
There has to be a sense of deliberate purpose and steely belief for Sean Wijesinghe to visualize the next few encounters ...starting with CR in Colombo this weekend.
I rather anticipate some cautious optimism in Kandy with Sean’s grasp on his team living up to expectations, especially given the quality and rugby pedigree of his wish-list squad that boasts more national caps than any other side. On paper it is an intimidating read to all rugby hearts and rival fans …but that has not been the case with the opening rounds this Dialog season. Coach Sean would shudder for an instant and grab a few breaths at the unforgiving thought of another upset at their Nittawela cauldron of pain ….? Our experts and speculators will cautiously contemplate a flutter or two on the form, availability of specialists and current list of injuries. These are the apex that dictates, as to how the team responds under pressure, and are able to follow their game plan to its desired conclusion at full time.
The million dollar question …will Kandy bounce back and have the combination to win the league championship? Or will it be Havies or Navy writing their own history? Naturally this contemplation, is the justified right of those rare species ...the self appointed experts. A little nudge will get them on the soapboxes, waxing lyrical about their game intel and why, so and so, cost Havies the game in Nittawela …mortals like us, not 'game smart' enough to reiterate the facts and float amongst the players, big hand to them for their persistence, special mention for google, what’s app. and other known search engines for having the content. All hail their versatility and social visibility!
So many have stepped up to the mark, but only few succeed at the highest, the pride of place in wearing the badge and upholding our traditions ....still a curious and wonderful fact . ..Great captains who have always been under pressure and managed to survive ...something we did for years without much fuss...lining up for the flag against the biggest and the best, travelling around Asia was particularly fun and some outrageous memories to boot. Saman Jayasinghe, Priyantha Ekanayake, Hisham Abdeen are 3 exceptionally talented and skilled players who never gave up when the odds were stacked against us. The pride to wear the white and green shirt with our SLRFU elephant will always be a handy reminder of those warrior days in the sun.
I did mention the start of the schools season Feb/March 2017 with the 7s and a chance for rivals and contenders, to size each other up during the tournament...will S Thomas' have the strength, stepping and petrol to go all the way...Isipathana will mark that card with much happiness, as well Science College, St Peter’s and the lions from Trinity. Royal with the home advantage will be expected to go all the way. Interestingly Sri Lanka’s juniors were outstanding and dominated the Asian 7s circuit. Big hand to the U18 and U20 7s teams for playing our island brand of rugby all the way to the Cup.
Does this automatically ensure a new environment and a repeat performance? Not so, unless we learn, plan and studiously aim to replicate conditions and skill levels ...the sole responsibility of the governing body.
Rugby in Europe is all about the Feb kick-off of the RBS 6 Nations ...and how England is on such a winning streak. They ended the year on 13 straight wins and coach Jones understands the mental strength that has set England apart last year. NZ coach Hansen thinks England will break the All Blacks 18 straight winning streak and sketch their own history. A delightful prospect for one and all. Expect a storm all 80 mins with our gladiators in the middle…between Ireland, France, England and possibly Scotland....well worth grabbing the wooly warmers and braving the crisp Feb winter air in Britain ...wonderful packages on offer by all the big tour operators here in; city by the sea...
There are varying schools of considerable thought about the skills and natural born players ...we have had the privilege of seeing during their peak, and against all the odds. The magical few who single-handed, turned games on its head with such scintillating ability that defied science and sliced defences with absolute disregard for man or reputation. The measure of such a being is not just playing here in Sri Lanka …but also repeating that razor sharp reaction skill against Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Japan and Samoa ...and a remarkable appetite for scoring tries.
Hisham Panther Abdeen has certainly got genetics on his side and that rare quality to smell the try line from the half way…the privilege of playing against him at club and later together for Sri Lanka is forever etched in my mind.
He was a colossus amongst all players and certainly deserves his pride of space in the hall of fame …there has not been a spark to match that command, and wonderful to see his HARFA Academy sharing skills and inspiring a new generation.
Let me wish all of you, (as I did at kickoff) an inspired new season ahead, makes it an exceptional one, with renewed vigour and determination to defy the odds ...bigger, better, faster, sharper!
Bula bula islanders and blessings to all rugby hearts in 2017.
