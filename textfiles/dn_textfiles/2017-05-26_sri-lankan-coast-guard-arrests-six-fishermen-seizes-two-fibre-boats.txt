Sri Lankan coast guard arrests six fishermen, seizes two fibre boats

Six Indian fishermen who were fishing near Neduntheevu in Sri Lankan waters, were arrested by Coast Guard on Tuesday night. The two fibre boats of the fishermen were confiscated and taken to Jaffna.
Sources said around 100 country boat fishermen of Nambuthalai, a fishing village, near Mimisal in Pudukkottai district ventured into the sea in around 35 country boats on Tuesday evening. As per their schedule, they were to return to the shore on Wednesday morning. But, all of them, except two country boats, returned. On growing suspicious, fellow fishermen began a search to trace the missing boats and the six fishermen.
During the search, some fishermen from Lanka told the Indian fishermen that the six were arrested by the Lankan Coast Guard.
The arrested fishermen and their boat were handed over to the assistant director of Fisheries, Jaffna, according to the Navy website.
