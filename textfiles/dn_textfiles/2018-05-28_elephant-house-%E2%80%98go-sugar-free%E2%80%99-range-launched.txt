Elephant House ‘Go Sugar Free’ range launched

Sri Lanka’s own Elephant House Beverages has introduced Sugar Free versions of several local favourites under its new, “Go Sugar Free” initiative.
Sugar Free versions of the beloved Elephant House Cream Soda, EGB, Necto and Orange Crush are currently available at supermarkets and grocers island-wide.
Further, this new range is being launched with a call to action to customers to move towards a healthier lifestyle. In fact, the “Go Sugar Free” logo builds on the use of the colour green, with its emphasis on healthy alternatives, as well as showcasing two arrows tied to the idea of moving forward.
Additionally, these arrows purposefully use increasingly lighter shades, subtly depicting beverages becoming healthier. The branding and design still encompasses existing brand personalities and elements of the Elephant House Beverage brands, to absorb the equity of the company’s larger than life, award winning brands.
Most importantly, the “Go Sugar Free” range offers up the same iconic Elephant House soft drink flavours and taste but with no added sugar. This is thanks to the innovative research and development carried out in Elephant House’s own laboratories by some of Sri Lanka’s best food scientists. This was also followed up by stringent testing by multiple consumer panels to ensure that the original taste of Elephant House soft drinks was maintained throughout, and that these beverages will continue to be well received locally.
In order to achieve the same taste and flavour profile of its legendary beverages, Elephant House “Go Sugar Free” products contain Stevia, a natural, plant-based sweetener. Therefore, fans will not have to sacrifice on flavour or taste, instead continue to enjoy the same great Elephant House soft drinks that are well loved by generation upon generation of Sri Lankans.
“Elephant House is currently expanding its product portfolio by offering more and more choices to consumers. The ‘Go Sugar Free’ initiative is another key milestone of that journey. In the recent past, Elephant House has also launched several healthier beverage options, from FitOFruit drinks, toTwistee Iced Tea, F5 isotonic sports drinks and most recently the re-launch of Elephant House flavoured Milk”, said Belindra Weerasinghe, Category Head of Elephant House Beverages & Vice President - John Keells Holdings.
