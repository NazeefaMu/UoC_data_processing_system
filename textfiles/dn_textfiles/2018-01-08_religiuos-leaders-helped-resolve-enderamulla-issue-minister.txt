Religiuos leaders helped resolve Enderamulla issue -Minister

Finance and Mass Media Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna said religious leaders helped to resolve the problems that arose after the Enderamulla Pradeshiya Sabha name was changed to Enderamulla 1, through a Gazette Notification.
The attempt made by certain people to gain political advantage by arousing communalism through this problem, was defeated due to the understanding of the real situation by the majority of the people in the area.
The Minister expressed his gratitude to the people in the area for their commitment towards Inter-religious harmony without allowing several political parties to create some communalism ideas in order to gain political advantage.
He also expressed gratitude to President Maithripala Sirisena, Provincial Councils Minister Faizer Mustapha, the Election Commission and Gampaha District Secretariat for their direct involvement to resolve this matter.
