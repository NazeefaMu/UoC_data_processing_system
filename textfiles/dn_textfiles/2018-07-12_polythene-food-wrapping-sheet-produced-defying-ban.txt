Polythene food wrapping sheet produced defying ban

Some parties continue to manufacture polythene food wrapping sheets using high density polythene (HDPE) resin defying the ban, said Plastic Pakaging Pte Ltd, Chairman Mervyn Dias
Speaking to Daily News Business he said the Central Environment Authority (CEA) should control the import of HDPE resin and crack down on manufacturers who defy the law and still produce food wrapping papers with HDPE resin.
Dias said food wrapping sheets which are produced with HDPE resin take over 500 years to degrade and cause heavy damages to living beings including fauna and flora. This is in contrast to biodegradable and compostable products which get composted within 180 days. He said bags and food wrapping sheets that are manufactured with HDPE resin was banned from September last year and was strictly enforced from January this year.
Chairman Dias said his 30 year old company manufactured food wrapping sheet and bags with the approval of the Central Environmental Authority which conform to the EU standard EN 13432 and they also exports the products to UK and France and the international certification is a must to export compostable bags.
He further said even the CEA has requested all polythene resin importers to be registered with them in order to stop manufacturing food wrapping sheets with HDPE resin.Meanwhile CEA, Waste Management Unit, Director Ajith Weerasundara said CEA officials are engaged in frequent raids on traders, hoteliers, grocery shops, pharmacies, restaurants to see who defy the law by keeping polythene wrapping papers in their possession.
