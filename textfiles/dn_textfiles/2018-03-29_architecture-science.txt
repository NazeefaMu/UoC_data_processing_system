Architecture is science

Imagine you're dashing through that lively spell of energy, in the blaze of the city, hearing dozens of elevator rings and expecting to grab a cocktail and jump into a big, comfortable bed at the end of the day.
A place for such rest and a getaway in the busy Colombo metropolis is Mövenpick hotel. Archworld spoke to Architect Murad Ismail, whose vision brought the 24 story hotel into life.
Mövenpick was originally designed for an apartment complex. It stands on a 90-perch, linear plot of land. It is a mid-riser building in the world's view and a high-riser in Sri Lanka.
"The view of the Northern side had to be blocked because it looked directly into Temple Trees," said Ismail. "And we concentrated on making the bedrooms remarkable -bathrooms with a view and corridors that meander around rather than thin and lengthy ones. We made the bedrooms with quite a large expanse of view -the sea view and city view," he said.

"What we're trying to create is a five plus standard hotel," said Ismail. It's a city hotel on a very small plot, going upward. It consists of a smaller reception and lobby area,and caters to three restaurants which, together with rooftop bar, invite not only in-house guests but guests from outside as well.The interior of the hotel was designed by a foreign interior design firm, together with the operators.
Mövenpick is a city business hotel. Basically, you need to be able to access the hotel, get into the lift, and go to your bedroom, explained Ismail. "Because you're not spending the time in your bedroom but in the city. When you come to the room, how comfortable you find it, how you enjoy the view in the morning is what counts."
"We tried to blend it with the fast developing Colombo skyline," said Ismail. "Colombo is a country within a country and it's going to be that way for a long time. There's an influx that's coming into Colombo. Population is going to increase and like in all cities, there's going to be high-rises and mid-rises around Colombo metropolis.
And if we did anything less than what we have done with Mövenpick, it wouldn't be worth having that 90 perch plot of land because of its cost."
"Once the building has to go up, you have to be very careful because we cannot lose our identity," stated Ismail. "Sri Lankan architecture is a mixture of farmer's hut and Dutch architecture. We are accepted around the world for our simple designs. And it's about keeping it simple and elegant."
Moving to a more tranquil picture, imagine yourself unpacking in a serene evening as the calming hum of wildlife whisper around you. You've shed the hustle and bustle in the city and entered the transforming wild -a swim in the sea, a sunset and a nap in the fresh wind.
Murad Ismail's imagination brought to life Jetwing Yala, a resort nestled in the charming wild.
Jetwing Yala is built on a linear strip of 38-acre land. It was built in 2004 after the tsunami devastation. "And due to reservations conferredat the time, 125-meter gap had to be left between the hotel and the beach," said Ismail.
"The situation of hotels in Yala is that, the guests cannot walk around the hotels after dark," noted Ismail."When designing Jetwing, I decided that it must be something of unique nature that also allows the guest to walk to the bars, restaurants, hang outs, balconies and terraces anytime of the day."
"We wanted the animals, including a family of leopards, to come into the gardens of the hotel from the scrub jungle," stated Ismail."And we have not disturbed the elephants from coming to the sea or right up to the dining area."
The expectation is to transform one or two night tourism and to make it a destination, creating a holiday for the guest that lasts more than a couple nights, said Ismail. "We concentrated on designing elegant bedrooms and a good dining experience with room in restaurants, terraces or in the lawn."
"It's not about just going to Yala; it's about going to spend time in a 38- acre property," explained Ismail. The spa is small but you could get massaged anywhere in the jungle. The beach is expected to be used for weddings and a nook has been allocated as a swimmable area and there is also a large swimming pool in the premises.
When you visit Jetwing Yala, "you may go to the game park and you also have tented camps on the side of the hotel," Ismail pointed out. If you're a guest and need privacy, the farthest, linear block of rooms allows you to drive your vehicle up to the entrance.
"People did not understand what we were doing," said Ismail. "They questioned about how environment-friendly it was and why chalets weren't designed."
"I moved away from the norms of chalets when designing Jetwing Yala because when you consider destination tourism as opposed to wildlife tourism, the guests prefer to walk around the hotel in the night, to have a drink and look at the sunset, and chalets restrict them from these activities," Ismail explained.
"Chalets are independent and would look environment friendly because they're small but the whole land would have needed to be cleared to build them in order to be able to walk from and to each chalet and the sides would have to be cleared for safety.So I stepped away from the idea to minimize the damage."
Environment-friendly moves together with sustainability. There's no point in building something for 50 years, with material that lasts for five years, remarked Ismail. "And spend so much chemical, material and human labour to maintain it. It is important to have sustainability with the lowest amount of maintenance to make the building last through its lifespan."
Jetwing Yala is a building that takes up 1/10 of its land. "We did not disturb anything there except where the building was coming," Ismail explained."We have replaced whatever had to be uprooted in shrub form. The plants are replaced on the building itself."
We meandered around trees and stilted the entire building and used the contours of land, he said further. All the rooms are designed to be looking through a gap between the dunes to the sea.
Jetwing Yala has sustainable energy. It makes its own energy with solar panels and cinnamon ferns.
"The one question I keep asking myself and answering is -forget the cost, forget the material- but why would someone come back here again for their next holiday?" pointed out Ismail.
How would you achieve it? "When you go to a hotel or a resort to relax, you should not spend more than five minutes to learn how to operate your room. It has to be as simple as possible in terms of the mechanism used," Ismail elaborated.
