Casual workers recruited for election duties

The Police Department has decided to recruit 1,041 casual workers to 489 Police stations countrywide in order to remove illegal posters and cut-outs that are currently displayed in public places.
The Police Department’s Senior DIG in charge of election duties, D. C. Wickramaratne, has received permission from the Election Commission to recruit these temporary labourers to be used for election duties of the Police Department. These casual workers would be employed until the end of the proposed local government polls on February 10, 2018, and the due allowances for their services would be paid by the Elections Department, said Kurunegala District Senior Divisional Secretary W. E. Jayathilake when he was contacted by the Daily News yesterday, in Kurunegala.
Jayathilake also added that all OICs of Police Stations countrywide have been instructed that they are responsible and answerable if illegal posters and cut-outs are not removed within their respective Police divisions properly, as it is a violation of current election rules and regulations.
