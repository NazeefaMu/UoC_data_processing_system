Japan pledges support to boost Lankan fisheries industry

The Japanese government has pledged to extend its fullest support for the development of Sri Lanka's fisheries industry and to strengthen Japanese market opportunities for Sri Lankan seafood exports, Fisheries Ministry sources said.
This was confirmed by Japanese State Minister for Foreign Affairs Masahisa Sato, during a discussion held with Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera who is currently on an official tour to Japan.
During the discussion, attention was drawn to the development of the fish processing industry in Sri Lanka.
It was discussed as to how the Japanese government could extend further assistance to boost the production of traditional Japanese raw fish products such as Sushi and Sashimi. Sri Lanka is currently manufacturing Japanese traditional meals such as Sushi and Sashimi which is made out of Tuna and they pay around Rs. 30,000 per kilo for the processed Tuna products.
During the discussion, Minister Amaraweera said that Japan is purchasing around 12 percent of Sri Lankan fisheries exports. They also purchase around 700 metric tons of Tuna annually, the ministry sources said.
