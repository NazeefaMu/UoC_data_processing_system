A corruption case filed against former Minister Keheliya Rambukwella and two others for allegedly causing an unlawful loss to the government after purchasing 600 of GI pipes using Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation’s (SLRC) funds during the previous Presidential Election was yesterday re-fixed for trial by Colombo Chief Magistrate’ Court. When the case came up before Colombo Additional Magistrate Aruni Artigala, former Minister Keheliya Rambukwella was not present in Court and his lawyer informed court that his client is currently abroad.
Accordingly, the case was re-fixed for trial on January 10 next year.
At a previous occasion, the Court decided to turn down the preliminary objections raised by accused challenging the maintainability of the charge sheets.
The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed charges against former Minister Rambukwella, former SLRC Director General SLRC Director General Chandrapala Liyanage and former SLRC Chairman Wimal Rubasinghe under Section 70 of the Bribery Act.
The Bribery Commission alleged that the three accused in the case had incurred a loss of Rs.990,000 to the SLRC after unnecessarily purchasing 600 of GI pipes on or around December 2, 2014.
Senior State Counsel Asad Navavi appeared for the Attorney General. President’s Counsel Kalinga Indatissa with Counsel Niroshan Siriwardena appeared for the former Minister.
