Condolence messages: passing away of the Amarapura Chapter Chief Prelate Most Venerable Davuldena Gnanissara Thera

Archbishop of Colombo, His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith
The Mahanayake of the Sri Lanka Amarapura Maha Nikaya, Most Ven. Davuldena Gnanissara Thera rendered an unparalleled service to the Buddha Sasanaya.
His services to the nation and the Buddha Sasanaya is commendable.
His service for the upliftment of spiritual well being of the people is laudable.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe
The Most Ven. Davuldena Gnanissara Thera with comprehensive knowledge of the Dhamma illuminated the Buddha Sasana. The Mahanayake Thera who rendered a yeoman service for the upliftment of Buddhism in the country, was conferred with titles of Sanskruthika Chakravarthi, Grantha Visharada, Dwi Bhasha Visharada, Sanskrutha Sahithya Saraswathie and shad Bhasha Parameshwara.
The Mahanayake Thera, who was fluent in Sinhala, Pali and Sanskrit languages, used his broad knowledge and abundant communication skills to spread Buddhism around the world.
Most Ven. Davuldena Gnanissara Thera was born in Davuldena in Uva Paranagama in the Uva province on December 30, 1915 and was ordained as a novice monk during his childhood.
May the Mahanayake of the Amarapura Maha Nikaya Most Ven. Davuldena Gnanissara Thera who spent his life to render the most valued and selfless service to the Buddha Shasana, attain the ultimate bliss of Nibbana.
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake
There is no argument that the late Amarapura Nikaya Agga Maha Panditha, linguist, Most Ven. Davuldena Gnanissara Thera, as a disciple of The Buddha, made his full commitments for the propagation and nourishment of the Buddha Sasanaya for nearly a century.
The late Maha Nayake Thera who was born in 1915 in a restive difficult village Davuldena in Uva Paranagama was ordained as a novice monk when he was 12.
Late Davuldena Maha Nayake Thera’s exemplary life leading up to 90 years as a Bhikkhu, teaches all monks and laymen the disciplines one should adhere to, such as a sapling growing to become magnificent tree.
Going by the teachings of the Buddha, the late Nayake Thera relinquished everything to prove the universal truth of impermanence. But, as a laymen, we are unable to bear the grief of his departure with equanimity.
However, none of us are mightier than the command of nature. What we can do now is to follow the footsteps of the great monk and make all possible commitments for the upliftment of the Buddha Sasana. Therefore, I believe it is the highest honour we can confer on the name of the late Nayake Thera.
The Chief Prelate of the Amarapura Nikaya, Agga Maha Panditha, the Most Venerable Davuldena Gnanissara Thera, May you attain Nibbana!”
Sri Lankarama monastery, Brisbane
Over the past week in Australia, it is with great Samvega that we have mourned the passing away of a father in the Order and a long standing beacon of Buddha Sasana to the Theravada Buddhist world from our mother land, Sri Lanka.
Aggamahapandita Most Ven. Davuldena Gnanissara Maha Nayaka Thero was the genuine embodiment of the term ‘Sakya Putta’ a noble son of the Lord Buddha who comes in once every few decades to make an indelible mark on society and the world at large.
The Maha Nayaka Thero in his background, academia and personal achievement, presents a type of character and personality which is among the finest we can recognize in the recent history of Buddha Sasana in Sri Lanka. An erudite scholar who is intelligent, wise, and capable of good command over Sangha and Sasana matters, which was always coloured with his down to earth humble demeanour that earned his mark of respect among the fellow members of the Sangha as well as the society. Because of his thoroughness in purity and undisputed record as a monastic and good grounding in meditation matters, he ought to have lived the holiest of lives in this degenerate era, leaving an enormous vacuum in the lineage of the Lord Buddha for many years to come.
At this moment of grief, we also like to acknowledge the yeoman service that the Maha Nayaka Thero has done to the propagation of Buddha Sasana in Australia. We were very fortunate to have had the Maha Nayaka Thero visiting our temple in 2010 to chair the Katina Ceremony that year. Following the event, Maha Nayaka Thero left an unceasing mark in Australia and the world by consecrating the ‘Sima Malaka’ at Sri Lankarama Buddhist Monastery in Brisbane, allowing new ordinations and higher ordinations to take place in this foreign country.
Whether it is the death of a Monk or others, it is inevitable. Death separates us. When the Maha Nayaka Thero is leaving us with that message after a life well lived, we wish he attain the supreme bliss of Nibbana!
