Troops continue assisting flood victims

Six Sri Lanka Light Infantry (SLLI) troops of the 583 Brigade under the 58 Division on Saturday (26) stacked bags of sands and prevented the breach of the Elapatha tank bund in Ratnapura after increasing water levels threatened piercing the bund.
Over 32 Army personnel took part in the emergency preventive measure as the water levels in the Elapatha tank began to rise forcing a threat to about 25 houses in the surrounding area. The sluice gates could not resist the huge quantity of water, but stacking of the bags of sand reduced the threat level by late Saturday night.
Meanwhile, troops of 9 Gemunu Watch (GW) under the guidance of Major General Sudath Perera, General Officer Commanding, 58 Division, launched a mobile medical clinic for flood-affected civilians, housed temporarily in the Yatagampitiya Primary School in Bulathsinhala.
The medical clinic was held at the Public Health Inspector’s Office (PHI) Paragoda West in the Bulathsinhala Divisional Secretariat. The transport facility was provided to displaced civilians to attend the medical clinic. Major General Sudath Perera, General Officer Commanding (GOC), 58 Division went to the Yatagampitiya School and inquired the emergency needs.
The troops of 9 GW of the same Division assisted the cleaning of flood-affected Elders’ Home in the Yatagampitiya area. The drainage lines of the elders’ home remained blocked due to muddy waters that flooded the area. 16 troops of 9 GW assisted the cleaning project on Saturday (26).
