PRESIDENT’S GUIDANCE UPHOLDS DIGNITY OF PARLIAMENT

Parliament met yesterday following the All Party Leader’s Meeting with President Maithripala Sirisena on Monday.
Parliament sittings which were limited to five minutes commenced with Deputy Speaker Ananda Kumasiri presiding, following a party leaders’ meeting chaired by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya. Parliament will meet again on Friday.
Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe were present. At the commencement of sittings, the Deputy Speaker announced that a Selection Committee will be appointed to select MPs to Parliament Committees, which stood dissolved following the prorogation of Parliament. He requested all political parties to nominate members to the committee and send the lists to Parliament Secretary General Dhammika Dasanayake as soon as possible.
Prior to the adjournment of the House, UNP MP Lakshman Kiriella requested the Chair to hold an investigation into the violent incidents in the Chamber on November 14, 15 and 16 which led to vandalism of public property.
The UPFA MPs shouted in disagreement.
The Deputy Speaker said that he would bring it to the attention of the Speaker.
The Leader of the House Dinesh Gunawardena rising to a Point of Order said the appointment of the Selection Committee must be done giving due recognition to the Government led by Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa.
“The Parliament affairs are handled by the Government and we are in the Government now. We must get the majority in the Section Committee to run its affairs smoothly,” he told the House.
Intervening at this point, UNP MP Mangala Samaraweera said the country does not have a Prime Minister or Government as at now as per 48 (2) of the Constitution. The Chief Government Whip S.B.Dissanayake at this point said a Section Committee could not be appointed if there is no Government. “Therefore, let us proceed with this proposal accepting the fact that there is a Government,” he added.
JVP Leader Anura Dissanayake pointed out that Speaker Jayasuriya clearly announced to the House on Thursday that the Government led by PM Rajapaksa stands dissolved after the passage of the No-Confidence Motion on Wednesday. It is not fair that the UPFA is requesting the majority of the Selection Committee when it lacks the majority of the House. The Selection Committee must reflect the current composition of members in the House,” he noted.
The Deputy Speaker then adjourned the House till 10.30 am on Friday (23). The UPFA, UNP and JVP convened back-to-back press conferences in the Parliamentary complex following the adjournment of the House.
Parliament sittings limited to five minutes yesterday showing no signs of reaching a compromise to end the current political impasse.
After three days of highly contentious sittings, excitement had mounted when the House met at 1 pm yesterday with special security arrangements in the Parliament complex.
The gallery was closed to the public and representatives of diplomatic missions and only the media personnel were allowed in. Commenting on the conduct of the Speaker,Attorney at Law Premanath Dolewatte claimed that legal action should be instituted against Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, as he has violated Criminal Law.
He said that the Speaker by his supportive action is tantamount to aiding and abetting the commiting of murder and provision of criminal law could be used if one ponders taking legal action against him. He also said that if the inquiries are going to be independent,charges should also be made against those who brought weapons to the Parliament.
“The Speaker has acted against the law and if he does not follow the norms and traditions of the Parliament, he does so with the intention of coming foward as the Common Candidate at the next Presidential election,” Dolawatte said.
He recalled that steps were taken to nail the Parliamentary seats as former Prime Minister John Kotalawala as a Member of Parliament had attacked another with a Chair saying the UNP is famous for misuse of public property.
Meanwhile, President Maithripala Sirisena expressed his great appreciation and satisfaction for the agreement by all political parties represented in Parliament, to observe and follow the guidelines given by him, at the All Party Conference held on Sunday aimed at ending the political stalemate in Parliament.
Once the President appointed a new Prime Minister and formed a New Cabinet,by the powers vested in him in the Constitution and when some had moved to create tension within the parameters of Parliament, the President drew his attention to the emerging situation. Thus, the President conducted two meetings, one on November 15 and the other on November 18, with the Leaders of Political Parties represented in Parliament.
Addressing the two meetings held on the said two days,President Sirisena advised them to conduct Parliamentary sessions avoid conflicting situations and by conducting the affairs of Parliament with decorum, following the Standing Orders and observing the Parliamentary traditions.
Responding positively to the instructions and advice given by the President when the Parilament met yesterday, at the Party Leaders Meeting, they agreed to act in accoradance with the Standing Oders and if a No Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister is to be tabled in Parliament, to do so following the Parliamentary traditions. They also agreed to avoid creating any crisis situation in Parliament.
The President had a very special word of thanks to All Political Pries represented in Parliament that acted in line with the guidelines given by him.
