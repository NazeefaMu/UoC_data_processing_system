JVP, a civilised party with high  ethical standards  - Anura Kumara

 
The JVP is a civilised party with high ethical standards, which produces disciplined persons, JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said.
He said it is praiseworthy how Vijitha Herath acted after an accident by setting an example to the public. He made these comments at a press conference at the JVP headquarters on Wednesday.
“Herath’s accident is not the only accident happened in Sri Lanka. Many accidents take place in the country per day. About eight persons die from accidents each day. This is just one of them. The accident took place when he attempted to save the life of a pedestrian. His cab collided a telephone post close to Rajagiriya junction. Is there anything wrong in attempting to save a human life?,” Dissanayake asked.
“Dissanayake called the Police and bore the responsibility. The Police had alleged him of not attempting to avoid an accident and for damaging state property. We paid the loss. He was charged with Rs. 1,500 for not attempting to avoid an accident,” said.
He said false news stories have been created claiming that he had driven the vehicle under the influence of liquor.
The JVP leader said he knew Herath since his university life. “Throughout the years, we have come to know about his personality,” he said.
