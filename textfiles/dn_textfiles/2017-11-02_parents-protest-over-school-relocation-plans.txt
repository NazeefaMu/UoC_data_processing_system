Parents protest over school relocation plans

A big gathering of parents, past pupils and well-wishers of Galle All Saints’ College staged a protest against the government’s decision to relocate the school premises out of Galle Fort yesterday.
The protestors numbering over 500 came in a protest march from the college to Galle District Secretariat and launched their demonstration opposite the secretariat obstructing the Colombo- Matara highway. They sat on the highway shouting slogans against the state’s decision.
Subsequently, a delegation of the demonstrators met Galle District Secretary S.T. Kodikara and handed over a petition opposing the move to relocate the school away from the Galle Fort.
Galle Heritage Foundation President Charted Architect Channa Daswatte addressing the media had disclosed the government’s move to relocate 15 state institutions including All Saints College located in the Galle Fort out of the ancient Dutch Fortress locality before December end this year.
All Saints College is the most pristine educational institution which was founded in 1867 under the benefaction of the Anglican Church. The college was initially established for the purpose of educating the children of the Dutch trading community, reliable chronicles testify.
