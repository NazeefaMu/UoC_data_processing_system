PMO launches loan scheme for young entrepreneurs

The Policy Development Office (PDO) of the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) is facilitating the Thurunu Diriya loan scheme to professionally qualified youths who are in business start ups with the Small Enterprise Development Department (SEDD).
The SEDD has identified 823 participant borrowers and helps about 200 to participate in business startups.
This was disclosed at a progress review meeting held at the PDO Office of the PMO yesterday. In addition, the SEDD has launched a programme to identify 10 young entrepreneurs from each Grama Niladhari Division who could participate in this scheme.
The scheme has been expanded and eligibility will be granted with a Grama Niladhari certifying businesses which have been established for three years. This certificate should be submitted to the Bank Manager through the Divisional Secretariat.
Further, a Degree/Diploma/NVQ certificate and business training provided by Vidatha Institutes in the District Secretariat has been recognized by the Bank of Ceylon for this scheme.
The Bank of Ceylon distributes leaflets to promote this scheme which is available at all branches. The Policy Development Office of the PMO with the assistance of the Home Affairs Ministry has mobilized to promote this loan scheme for eligible borrowers. Guarantors are not required.
