Jealousy amongst people prevents development: Duminda

The majority in this country listen to bana preaching on every Poya day and observe sil. Millions view dhamma programs through electronic media, but they are jealous of others and prevent the others becoming prosperous, Agriculture Minister and SLFP General Secretary Duminda Dissananayake said.
He was addressing a public meeting following the commencement of the overall rehabilitation of the road running from track 6 Angamuwa up to Rajangane fishery village.
The minister said people’s jealously towards each other is the reason why the country is still under-developed and cornered among other nations. “If a politician blocked development in a village just because a majority in that village were against his party and policies, it was not justifiable at all,” the minister said.
He said he settled the personal issues with those involved in them and dedicatedly worked to upgrade the village infra-tructural facilities.
The minister said he would take steps to promote the Rajangane fisheries village on the concept of ‘village with a tank’ similar to that of ‘tank and the dagoba’ theory. Uncultivated plots of land are being distributed among the youths in Rajangane irrespective of their party politics to enable them to cultivate under a lift irrigation system. “It is true that Mahinda Rajapaksha served the country immensely. But he is barred from contesting the presidential elections again in terms of the constitutional laws. Is it proper SLFP supporters to go after him for nothing?
“We shall definitely have a strong presidential candidates. The laws are not changed. In this background, it is fruitless to support to promote a person to be President not allowed in the law, the minister said.
Minister Duminda said those who were shouting with crocodile tears, pretending that they were the saviours of the people were opportunists and hypocrites. He asked people not to get misled or misguided by them.
