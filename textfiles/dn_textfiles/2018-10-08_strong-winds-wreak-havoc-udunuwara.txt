Strong winds wreak havoc in Udunuwara

Gale-force winds accompanied by heavy rains damaged more than 70 houses while displacing more than 200 people in the Udunuwara Divisional Secretariat area, last Saturday.
Several inmates of a house including an infant were injured and had to be hospitalised when a large tree fell on the house, in Rangoda, an official said.
The displaced have been housed in temporary shelters and immediate measures will be taken to repair damaged houses, an official at the Divisional Secretariat said.
He said damage to property too will be estimated on an immediate basis with a view to granting compensation.
The government officials were joined by police and security forces in providing relief.
Meanwhile, officials advised residents to trim the branches of trees round their houses to minimise possible damage caused by strong winds.
