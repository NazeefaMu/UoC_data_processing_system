Citizens' Mail

The bionic man
The frequent replacement of the original with the artificial has made Prince Philip a bionic man. At the age of 97 he has entered hospital to replace the hip bone. But he is more known for his cutting wit than his artificial limbs.
He came to Sri Lanka at the invitation of the Institution of Engineers to declare open the brand new headquarters. The gallery was packed with graduates and students. Pointing to a fallen pot of flowers Prince Phillip remarked that he hopes our engineering is not like that.
His cutting, withering, whimsical barbs are no respecter of persons. The Queen herself has been the target. In Belize in 1994 when the Queen was chatting to her hosts on the quayside, he shouted at her from the deck of Britannia Yak, yak, yak, come on get a move on.
Here a few more examples of his numerous gaffes.
* “I declare this open whatever it is,” he remarked on a visit to Canada in 1969.
* “They must be out of their minds,” in the Solomon Islands in 1982 when he was told that the annual population growth was 5%.
* “If you stay here much longer you will all be slitty eyed,” to British students in China during the 1986 state visit.
* “It looks as if it was put by an Indian,” pointing at an old fashioned fuse box in a factory near Edinburgh in 1999.
