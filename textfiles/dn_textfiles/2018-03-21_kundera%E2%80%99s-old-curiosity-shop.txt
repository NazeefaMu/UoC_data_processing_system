Kundera’s old curiosity shop

Since enjoying the creative world titled Unbearable Lightness of Being written by Czech writer Milan Kundera, I was hunting for all his other works translated into English. Kundera seems to have come to the limelight as a result of some of his books getting banned his own country. It was a controversial issue in the world of literature why his book got banned.
One of the foremost collections of short stories titled as Laughable Loves was banned Czechoslovakia in 1968. But the book in English translation became well known. Though read and left somewhere, I rediscovered the world of Kundera’s creative observation plus insights to human life via these seven short stories. Though moth-eaten in several pages, I still managed to wade through the contents resourcefully.
A boy meets a girl
The first short story in many ways cannot be classed as a conventional narrative that one comes across in various other collections. The story is titled as The Hitchhiking Game and runs to 12 short episodes where the central experience is the boy meets girl, but with a sharp different in each episode similar to a series of film shorts. The boy is a carefree individual who is described as a driver of a vehicle in which the gas indicator points nearly to the empty.
But he drives until he finds a gasoline station. At this juncture, he encounters a young girl who needs a ride. Then comes the second episode where they come to know each other, where they talk about matters they agree and disagree. At times the dialogues that ensue are more or less philosophic and poetry two different types of attitudes with agreeable moments. The narrative line develops to point when in the other episode developing gradually into intimacy dispelling their disagreement.
At one moment, Kundera creates the following sentences analysing the innerness in the two characters.
The girl was grateful to the young man for every bit of flattery, she wanted to linger for a moment in its warmth and so she said. “You’re very good at lying.”
“Do I look like a liar?”
“You look like you enjoy lying to women,” said the girl and into her words there crept unawares a touch of the old anxiety, because she really did believe that her young man enjoyed lying to women.
Jealousy and intimacy
What happens to the reader who browses the pages? The reader is made to involve in the situations as created by Kundera with a sense of simplicity as well as an underlying complexity. Kundera depicts the nature of the concept of jealousy, sexuality, intimacy and at the same time, he shows the light-heartedness of the two characters, the challenging factor to law and morality as the episode after episode pass the reader is made to know that at a place called Nove Zamky it was already getting dark.
Both of them seem to have come a long way, which seemingly is symbolic of the travails in one’s lifetime. Then they come to terms when the young man asks the girl:
“May I ask you where you are going, Miss?”
She shows no sign of any particular place or destination. This is followed by stating that both of them had a curious game of staying in an inn. They go on staying and it looks in the world of the writer ‘a curious game’.
The narrative does not end in the usual way of a departure. The things happen from moment to moment as in some of the short narratives to Sartre. The episode 12, which is the high point, states:
The young man began to call compassion to his aid, so as to be able to calm the girl. There was still thirteen days vacation before them.
The short narrative titled as Let The Old Dead Make Room For The Young Dead is by and large an eye-opening experience written in fourteen short episodes. The narrative revolves around a widow who visits a far-off cemetery to pay respect and honour her dead husband and thirty-five years ago. But she finds that the place in the cemetery is made to be untraceable as the fees for renovating has not been duly paid.
Memories of sorrow
But in her lamentations and grieving moments, she comes across a gradually ageing man who talks to her and tries to share her sorrows. It looks as if they have met each other some time ago, but at the same time, the factor of time had made both of them wipe their memories off. Both of them seem to be in need of the intimacies of life. But at the same time, they have certain barriers that prevent them being intimate.
A sensitive reader may find that though nothing happens drastically in the manner of a trick-ending, the two characters are made to reveal their innernesses. Thus, though a simple narrative it is nevertheless a complex human situation is presented via verbal pictures. One such example comes in this manner as the conclusion.
Before her eyes, she still saw her son’s derisive face and when now her host drew her to him by force she said: “Please leave me alone for a moment,” and released herself from his embrace.
The story titled Nobody Will Laugh is a narrative which evokes a sense of humour when one self-esteemed writer who had completed a research work on an obscure subject tried his best to get a review of it in order to promote. In this direction, he gets around a scholar who seems to know about the topic related to the work. However much the researcher tries to get a favourable review, he finds it a futile effort as the scholar evades the issue in various forms.
This narrative pokes fun at the academics and their academia. As such, the scholarly lecturer says: Nothing would make me happier than to write a review of your work. But as I explained to you in my letter, I am not considered an expert on the Czech 19th Century and in addition, I am on bad terms with the editors of Visual Arts Journal who take for a hardened modernist so that a positive review from me could only harm you.
In this manner, the narrative experiences and the form differs with a number of human situations. In this collection, Milan Kundera shows with skill the creative standpoint in narratology, surpassing the limitations of mere storytelling.
