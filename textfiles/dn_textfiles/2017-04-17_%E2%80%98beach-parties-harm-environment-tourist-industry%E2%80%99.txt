‘Beach parties harm environment, tourist industry’

Beach parties which continue late at night cause more harm than good to the tourist industry and the environment. They are held throughout a week on the Mirissa Beach which go on till dawn during the peak of the tourist season, Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA) General Manager and CEO Dr. Terney Pradeep Kumara said.
“Marine life is at risk due to the use of high powered laser beams and decibel music that resonate at night at some of the tourist attractions which are advertised as beach parties,” he said.
The MEPA established by the Sri Lanka Government under the Marine Pollution Prevention Act No. 35 of 2008 is responsible for preventing, controlling and managing the pollution of Sri Lanka’s marine environment
“Beach parties are held seven days a week during the tourist season in the Mirissa Tourist zone in the south. They start off at around 8.30 or 9.00 pm and go on till 3.00am. High powered laser beams light up the waves and DJ music penetrates areas miles away. This is very harmful to marine life. The Mirissa beach has been a natural nesting ground for sea turtles, but they are shying away now due to such harmful tourist extravaganzas,” he said.
“The tourist industry should be developed but not by harming the attractions that draw the tourists to the country. If the authorities do not take immediate action to control the situation, the industry is going to suffer,” Dr. Kumara said.
“I planned to stay in Mirissa with my family for five days but there was so much noise at a nearby hotel last night which went on till 4 am this morning that we decided to leave. I complained to the hotel management and even to the Police about the noise but no one stopped it,” a tourist who was loading her bags into a vehicle said.
“Mirissa was a quiet and calm beach at night when I came to Sri Lanka five years ago. I loved watching the turtles come ashore to lay their eggs but I am told that they stay away due to the lights and noise,” she added.
“Guests come to Sri Lanka to get away from their hectic work schedules and relax. They cherish the serene and quiet locations. Mirissa beach is an ideal location at day where tourists can take in the sun and swim without being bothered by beach boys, vendors or beggars. Over 3,000 hotel rooms were available in the Mirissa tourist zone, but only a few tourists attend these beach parties. In-house guests complain to us every day, and we in turn complain to the police but no action is being taken,” a hotel owner in the Mirissa Tourist zone said.
“I find it difficult to concentrate on my books,” a girl preparing for the GCE Advanced Level Exam to be held in August said. “I am kept awake until about 3 am due to the loud music and it is impossible to concentrate.
We complain to the police when the noise is unbearable, but it seems they are unable to stop it,” she said.
