Corporate Health and Productivity Awards  in february

The first ever ‘Sri Lankan Corporate Health and Productivity Awards’ will be staged in February 2019 to recognize enterprises engaging in health and productivity management.
The Chamber of Young Lankan Entrepreneurs (COYLE) announced its plans to organize the event as their pioneer project in collaboration with Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO).
The concept of the event is based on the Health and Productivity Stock Selection program held in Japan by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) and Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE).
COYLE Chairman, Dinuk Hettiarachchi said, people are the greatest asset in an organization which is a globally accepted fact. “Health and well-being are attributes that need to be at the heart of any corporate strategy as they involve the best asset that is people. A healthy, happy and committed workforce will constantly play a crucial role towards the success and productivity of an organization. Thus enhancing the status of health and well-being of people in an organization creates a win-win scenario for all stakeholders”, he said.
He added, “Absenteeism and rising healthcare costs hamper organizational profitability. Short term solutions may not address these situations. The workshop we did today consisting over 70 corporate bodies with representation of a cross-section of businesses in Sri Lanka shed light on long-term approaches which has increased productivity and protected the talent behind businesses”.
Visiting Prof of Tama University (Hitachi Ltd) Dr. Yoshi Ichikawa who has conducted the workshop said, “In today’s volatile economic scenario, sustaining corporate advantage has become crucial for organizations. Corporate health programs may optimize performances, retention and productivity. A healthier, happy and positive thinking workforce will reflect on higher product quality and customer service”.
Selection process to pick the winning companies for the awards will consist of surveys and workshops and will be based on a five-fold criteria provided by international standards, ISO and PAS.
These criteria include, positioning of health and productivity management in management philosophy and policies, organized frameworks established for tackling health and productivity management issues, specific systems established for ensuring health-conscious management and measures for implementing them, measures for assessing and improving health and productivity management and adherence to laws, regulations and risk management.
