CR favourites to topple CH today

CR & FC will go out as the favourites to overcome rejuvenated CH and FC but the game could be a closely fought out battle for supremacy in their Dialog ‘A’ Division inter-club league rugby tournament match at Racecourse international grounds, Reid Avenue today commencing at 3.45pm.
Unbeaten CR have managed to win both their matches in this ongoing league tournament of 2017/18 winning against Air Force SC (21-9) at Air Force grounds in Ratmalana and a sensational second half rally win coming from 7-23 behind at half time to stun Navy SC 38-23. Acting captain cum centre Tharinda Ratwatte contributed a fantastic 23 points.
The red shirts will field the same team which did duty for them last week against Navy but will miss the services of their speedy captain and wing three quarter Kavindu Perera. He is out due to a three-match suspension slapped on him for a high tackle carried out in their opening fixture against the Airmen. Inspiring centre Tharinda Ratwatte will be in charge of the team as acting skipper for the second game in succession.
CR boasts of having in their ranks quality talented players in the form of Ratwatte, Kushan Indunil, Kavindu de Costa and Chanaka Chandimal who are playing a key role as the halves combination. Then comes the granite forward cum rolling maul pilot Supun Warnakulasuriya and players in the caliber of Charana Chamikara, Udara Gayan, Vageesha Weerasinghe, Reeza Rafaideen, Sashan Mohamad and ever reliable full back Rehan Silva.
CH and FC might look to register a shock win through their think tank and former national captain cum flanker Yoshitha Rajapaksa leading them from the front.
The CH and FC outfit has failed to live up to expectations losing (6-23) to Kandy SC at Racecourse grounds in their first match and lost to Army SC last week by (15-20) after leading 15-10 at the breather. CH who has faced an unexpected plight losing some of their key players yet recovering from injuries is bound to field a couple of sidelined big names for today’s game. However adding to their woes would be the absence of their granite number eight Chathura Dilshan due to a nasty injury he sustained in their opening game against defending champions Kandy SC. Most probably Dilshan will be out for the entire first round.
Rajapaksa will face another acid test after losing to the soldiers to obtain a win in this game, while the CR skipper Ratwatte has fared admirably well with the young resurgent force pulling off a superb win over formidable sailors last week. Hence they will go all out to pull this one through with a bonus point victory as well.
Last year CR & FC won the first round as well as the return match at Longden Place and Racecourse grounds respectively.
