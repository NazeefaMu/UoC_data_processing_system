No increase in electricity rates - Minister

Although fuel prices have been increased in the local market following the escalation of world oil prices, no decision has been taken to increase charges levied for a unit of electricity, Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.
This Minister made this announcement during a recent inspection tour of a ground breaking local factory providing solar panels for the first time in Sri Lanka.
Minister Siyambalapitiya said the Government was making a determined effort to build a strong economy in the country, while facing the vagaries of the international market.
In doing so, the government’s intention is to keep the economic burdens on the people at a bare minimum. It was in this manner that fuel prices were increased. But, no decision had been taken to increase electricity rates. Our endeavour is to provide maximum relief to the people,” he said.
