Sri Lankans’ fertility rate increases

 The fertility rate of Sri Lankan people has increased from 1.9 in 1998 to 2.4 in 2012. The figure may have further increased now, Family Planning Association of Sri Lanka Executive Director Thushara Ranasinghe Agus said.
Addressing a media seminar in Colombo yesterday, she said there is an upward trend in teen pregnancies in Sri Lanka during the recent past and many married women still follow conservative family planning methods leading to unwanted pregnancies and abortions.
Senior Professor of demography, Colombo University Prof. Indralal De Silva said the age of getting married among Sri Lankan men and women has gone down and it was 28 for men and 23.5 for women in 1971. Now it has come down to 27 for men and 23.4 for women. A lot of problems arise with the rapid increase of population. Solid waste management, deforestation, urbanisation, pollution are some of them, he said.
Consultant Community Physician attached to the Family Health Bureau Dr. Sanjeewa Godakanda said the best age gap between two kids of a family is 3 to 5 years. The best age to have kids is 20 to 25 years, he said. Family Planning Association Medical Director Dr. Harischandra Yakandawala said the family Planning Association of Sri Lanka stopped providing permanent birth control methods since various parties have put pressure on the association.
