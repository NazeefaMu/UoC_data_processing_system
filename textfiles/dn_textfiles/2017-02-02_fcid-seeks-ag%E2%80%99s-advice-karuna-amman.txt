FCID seeks AG’s advice on Karuna Amman

The FCID conducting investigations into an incident where former Deputy Minister Vinayagamoorthy Muralidharan alias Karuna Amman had allegedly misused a Presidential Secretariat bullet proof armed vehicle worth Rs.90 million, informed Court yesterday that they have sought the Attorney General’s advice regarding future legal action against the former Deputy Minister.
When the case came up before Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara, the FCID told court that the abstract of the investigations have been referred to the Attorney General for his advice.
Meanwhile, the Chief Magistrate decided to relax bail conditions imposed against the former Deputy Minister and permitted him to appear before CID on last Sunday of every month.
The former Deputy Minister was arrested by the FCID on November last year over the allegation that he failed to return the vehicle to the Presidential Secretariat following losing his ministerial position in 2015.
The FCID further alleged that the former Deputy Minister had failed to return this vehicle until August 2016 by violating the provisions of Public Property Act. He is currently out on bail.
