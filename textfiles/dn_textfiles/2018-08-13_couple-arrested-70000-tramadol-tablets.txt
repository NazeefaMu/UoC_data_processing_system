Senior DIG in the North Roshan Fernando said a couple was arrested with 70,000 tramadols to the value of Rs 2.1 million in the Kattikulam police area in Vavuniya yesterday.
The suspects were identified as Adambarage Roshan Alwis (24) from Kelaniya and Dulwelagedara Rasmi Udari (18) from Matale. Jaffna SSP Warna Jayasuriya carried out the investigation under Senior DIG North Roshan Fernando.
The DIG said the tablets were brought to Mannar from Tamil Nadu and police nabbed the couple in Kattikulam when they were trying to smuggle the tablets to Colombo in a Suzuki Alto car.
He said the investigations reveal that a Sri Lankan in Dubai has sent them to another Sri Lankan agent in Tamil Nadu and they sent them to Sri Lanka on boat.
The DIG said tramadol is distributed among schoolchildren.
“It is a painkiller and usually doctors prescribe 50 mg.
He said 450 mg tablets were found.
He said one tablet costs about Rs. 300 and the tablet is not as strong as heroin but very addictive.
