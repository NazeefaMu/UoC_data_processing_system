Split averted, says Tna

The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) yesterday said its coalition members had settled their differences and would contest the upcoming local government elections under the ITAK banner.
Constituent party leaders Mavai Senathirajah (ITAK), Selvam Adikkalanathan (TELO) and Dharmalingham Siddarththan (PLOTE) met with Parliamentarians and party representatives on Saturday and discussed the forthcoming elections and resolved all connected issues, a statement from the TNA said. Nominations will be submitted with the House symbol of the ITAK. Voters in the North and the East were asked to support the Tamil National Alliance contesting under the ITAK and the House symbol, the statement said.
The TELO and PLOTE had recently stated that they will contest separately at the LG polls.
