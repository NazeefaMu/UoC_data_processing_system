Gatlin scorches to Rio, Felix powers home

Justin Gatlin clocked the fastest 100 meters of the year to book his ticket to Rio at the US Olympic trials here Sunday as Allyson Felix shrugged off her injury woes to power to victory in the 400m.
Gatlin won in a blistering 9.8 seconds at Hayward Field to edge out young pretender Trayvon Bromell who was second in 9.84sec with Marvin Bracy third in 9.98sec.
The win sends the 34-year-old 2004 Olympic champion to Rio as the biggest threat to reigning champion Usain Bolt.
Gatlin, twice banned for doping offences during his controversial career, had earlier signalled his readiness by setting a season-best 9.83sec in the semi-finals.
“I was trying to get me a ticket on that boat going to Rio,” a delighted Gatlin said afterwards.
“My family has a ticket and that put pressure on me to punch my ticket,” said Gatlin, who confirmed he will not race again before Rio after running in the 200m here this week.
