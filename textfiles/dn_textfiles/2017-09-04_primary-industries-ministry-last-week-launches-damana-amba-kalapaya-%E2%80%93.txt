Primary Industries Ministry last week launches Damana Amba Kalapaya – Damana  Mango Range

Primary Industries Ministry last week launched Damana Amba Kalapaya – Damana Mango Range with an eye for export and add foreign exchange earning to the treasury.
The first phase of the free distribution of Tom E J C mango plants among the 10,000 farmer-families took place with the participation of Primary Industries Minister, Daya Gamage and the officials along with the Secretary of the Damana Divisional Secretariat, Ampara.
Farmers selected for the occasion from nine Grama Niladhari Divisions including Pahala Landa Grama Niladhari Division were symbolically given mango plants of this variety, with necessary instruction as to how they should take care of the Tom EJC mango plant to get the best of their labour and commitment.
The project is to provide 25 mango plants of this variety to each family numbering 10,000 altogether and drawing the women to take the lead in implementing the project and earn extra money to meet their ends. The total number of mango plants would be 250,000 altogether and Rs.100 million has been invested to this project.
It is claimed that there is a big demand for this variety of mango in the world market for its unique taste and pleasant appealing appearance. The strategy of the Primary Industries Ministry is to secure a permanent place in the foreign market to this variety of mango and ensure continuous supply as the mango trees of this type bear fruits for long eight months unlike the other varieties.
In his address to those present at the occasion Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage said through the Tom EJC mango plant project the country enters into a new economic era responding to the need of the times. “Thanks to our First Prime Minister, D. S. Senanayake, Father of Our Nation, the entire Ampara district is nourished by his Agriculture scheme in the face of opposition from many quarters. And with the launching of Tom EJC Mango Plant project we enter into a new economic, era, Minister Gamage observed.
He went onto say that he wanted the women-folk to enter the scene and take the project forward, instead of flying overseas to work as housemaids and earn to keep the family fire burning through their hard labour. “I am confident that they can earn the same amount or something more by getting themselves involved in the Tom EJC Mango Plant project. The amount they earn would also be more than what they earn from farming, “ he said.
“From each mango tree one would be able to get 60 to 120 kilos and if the selling price Rs. 150 or Rs. 200 one could earn Rs,12, 000 to 15000. We will also introduce a new investor and steps also would be take construct a new factory for this purpose. Our aim through all these activities double our foreign exchange earning, the Minister pointed out.
