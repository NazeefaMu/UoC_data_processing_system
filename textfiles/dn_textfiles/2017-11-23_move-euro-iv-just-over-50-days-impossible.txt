Move to Euro IV in just over 50 days, impossible

The government in the recent budget announced the need for automobile sector compliance to Euro 4 standards at the minimum.
This is a good initiative as Sri Lanka had no standard at all so far for emission compliance automobile industry sources say.
What is Euro standard?
Introduced in 2000, the Euro norms are emission control standards that are based on the European regulations (Euro norms). They set limits for release of air pollutants from equipment using internal combustion engines, including vehicles.
Typically, the higher the stage, the more stringent the norms. Is this a good thing? Yes it is a good initiative to ensure that the air pollution is minimized by way of operating unfit equipment.
Euro IV standards stipulate lower levels of sulphur emissions compared with Euro III. Also, hydrocarbon and nitrogen oxide are lower under Euro IV.
Why is it important?
While the initiative is a very good one, the method of implementation is of serious concern.
The sudden requirement of meeting a higher standard had come as a surprise to some auto companies purely due to the short time frame give for compliance. As far as we know nowhere in the world that there had been such a short time given for shifting to a higher emission standard.
Many such companies will have to start the homologation process with their principles which will take 6-8 months depending on the readiness of the manufacturer and the established manufacturers will not offer higher Euro compliant products without following the laid down procedure.
Besides this the cost of a high Euro standard vehicle will be much higher than the cost of a lower standard vehicle and the extra cost will have to be transferred to the ultimate customer at the point of sale or service.
Who Cares?
Swanky vehicles are nice, but nicer and more important is clean air. In many countries by law clean air is a fundamental right. You can look forward to breathing in cleaner air as new vehicles will in the future have to be equipped with engines compliant with Euro IV or better standards. Upgraded emission norms could also mean higher fuel efficiency. However, the Euro IV compatible fuel will have to be made available across the country,beforeimplementation and a grace period given for adoption.
On top of this oil companies will have to spend large sums of capital outlays to ensure availability of the Euro IV standard fuel Island wide. So, fuel bills could also rise.
The fair basis,
The main requirement is a grace period given based on the implementation plan, have a dialog with all stakeholders and have a roadmap for implementation so that it sounds to be a professional approach and no one gets affected due to the sudden decisions and the cost factors are under control for all.
A period of 1 years grace is not going to make people develop breathing difficulties and the corporates involved in the business would better appreciate.
What is needed from the current government is to facilitate businesses, and be responsible in policy making that will force the established institutions to face difficulties.
