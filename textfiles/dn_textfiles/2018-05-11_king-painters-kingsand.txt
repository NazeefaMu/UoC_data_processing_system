The King of Painters at Kingsand

`Kingsand and Cawsand (hidden but well known)
Before my arrival villages were homes
To two little cottages, the occupants of each
Used to hang their laundry right on the beach
In the early eighteen hundreds when smuggling was rife
An’stuff got plundered an’ men got life (in Australia)’
Clock Tower ESQ – The Story Of The Institute and Me
– By Jacquie Monty

The shrill wind wrapped around my head, swirling like a whirling dervish, grabbing everything it touched with its stormy fingers, including me and a couple of other hardy walkers on a circuit around Cornwall’s pretty pastel coloured twin villages of Kingsand and Cawsand. Colourful fishing trawlers that could easily be mistaken for 18th century wreckers’ boats, were being thrown in all directions in the howling gale out to sea.
I was glad to retreat into the aptly named Storm Cottage, a stunning aquamarine blue haven, which comes complete with a sunken bathroom in the basement and boat portholes looking out to sea, with waves that swirl over the rocky escarpment below.
I sink my weary bones into the rollmop bath filled with sweet smelling essence of Waterlilies, Orchids and Sweet Grass. Here, I soak up the sound of the sea while reading one of Storm Cottage’s books of amazing memoires about the area, ‘As it t’was.’
Luckily, unlike the scene in this charming book written by one of Kingsand’s late creative residents, this spacious and homely abode has all the mod cons. You no longer have to beat and wash your laundry out on the rocks below, there’s a new washer dryer in the laundry room for that task.
The house is distinctly relaxed with Cornish twist - there are drift wood sculptures, Cath Kidston lighthouse cushions and pictures that instruct you: ‘This House Runs on Cornish Time’, with an arrow sign below directing you straight to the beach.
It’s built over four floors, with three charming bedrooms, two of which have spectacular sea views of Plymouth Sound, and three bathrooms, all with a simple, dreamy New England feel. There's parking for three cars in the yard next to the sea - extremely rare in a village this higgledy piggledy.
And whatever the weather, Storm Cottage's thick walls and excellent central heating means you won’t have to go out looking for logs - or even food if you arrive in late - as there’s a cupboard full of emergency supplies.
History and the sea pervade every corner of this very special spot. The colourful Cornish bay, famously where Napoleon was held captive on board the HMS Bellerophon in Cawsand Bay before being shipped off to St. Helena, provides spectacular Turner-like views from the open plan lounge. But even from the stylish kitchen, where you can make a cup of Cornish Smuggler’s Brew to warm yourself up on arrival, you can watch the hands turn on the iconic historic four-faced Kingsand Clock Tower, erected to commemorate the coronation of King George V.
Daily life passes each side of the cottage. On the seaward side you can watch yachts, ferries, warships and submarines pass by - as well as the odd dolphin, seal and even a shark! On the land side you can watch village life unfold as you enjoy some alfresco dining on the sheltered sun deck balcony. A delightful sun trap on most summer days, this is a place you can read a book with the hypnotic sound of the sea behind you or enjoy people watching as they wander in and out of the Westcroft Art Gallery below - an excellent spot to buy something unique such as a glass azure blue blown bowl, which when held in the hands feels like water is pouring through it.
For centuries, all types of artists have tried to capture the beauty and magic of this ever-changing shoreline between the two villages that were once divided by the border between Cornwall and Devon. The book of Cornish Villages in Storm Cottage’s ground floor sea view bedroom tells you more about the area’s time-locked villages, which are magical in their ever changing climatic mood from spectacular storms, with waves the height of the clock tower in 2014, to mist that makes the place vanish all together, and back again, even in winter months, to golden sun that breaths warmth like dragon’s fire across this enigmatic forgotten spot.
The ever changing light and timeless beauty of the villages are the reason Oscar nominated film director Mike Leigh picked it for making a film about the greatest British historic, narrative painter of all time – England’s most romantic landscape artist, Turner. A master of atmosphere and storytelling through his obsessive attention to light and colour, Turner famously captured the engineering beauty of the nearby Tamar Bridge, at Saltash, built by Islambard Kingdom Brunel.
You can see why Mike Leigh used most of the local villagers in his painterly film. One certainly feels, when out and about or having a drink or a meal at The Devonport pub, as if you are in the middle of a living film set, where half the actors got left behind. In some cases, their haircuts and demeanour are unchanged from the 19th century. The place is packed with character and characters, each one with amusing tales to tell. Like Steino, whose family came from Cologne in Germany to trade in leather at the old tannery in Plymouth, and has swapped a seafaring life for Poldark roles and Hollywood movie parts, as well as cooking delicacies like fish head soup and almond tofu.
I amuse myself by thinking that in 2020 people living in Kingsand and coming to see the Turner film locations will be able to use the Turner twenty pound note, due to a landslide vote by the general public to have him on a English monetary note. Turner’s self portrait has been selected to print on it, along with one of Turner’s most important artistic works, The Fighting Temeraire. Emblazoned it will also be a quote from the artist, ‘light is therefore colour’, as well as his signature - and nowhere is light more colourful and different than here.
As I travelled further, it felt more like I was in the Mediterranean. I admired creative door knockers with mermaids and anchors on, hand painted signage and incredible five-hundred-year-old rampart walls - in many ways it felt more like a Spanish walled city than a Cornish coastal town.
Each thickly walled house is different and has a story to tell. With a vast range of quirks, crags, twists, steps, curves and narrow passages winding their way past, some are made from the pink local Cornish rock - once traded with the Roman Empire - and others are built from stones and rubble thickly plastered over and painted with pretty, historic colours. The villages nestle into the coast of Rame, a peninsula that is isolated due to its geography. It is bounded by the English Channel, Plymouth Sound, the River Tamar and the River Lynher, which means that, having crossed the Tamar Bridge, you have to double back on yourself to reach this forgotten corner.
The area is steeped in military history. With epic vantage points from Penlee Point across the channel to France and beyond, it’s no wonder Rame has always been a strategic defence location. The area is dotted with interesting remnants of Napoleonic fort battlements - Maker Barracks is thought to be one of the oldest of its kind in the UK - as well as World War 2 pill boxes for guarding against enemy attacks. Across The Sound on the Devon side you can just spot some Gladstone Follies ‘fake forts’ built to frighten the Spanish away.
The house is reflective of the owners passion for Cornwall with loads of books to read with amazing things to do in the area, fascinating pieces of art on the walls and telescopes so you can watch the stars. You can also take part in the many exciting village events like the yearly May Day carnival of banishing winter and welcoming in summer known as The Black Prince Flower Boat Festival.
