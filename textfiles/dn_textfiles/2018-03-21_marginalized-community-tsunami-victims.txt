Marginalized community of tsunami victims

Fourteen years since the tsunami hit Sri Lanka, many of its victims in the South complain that they are yet to receive reprieve from the government and that many of the houses they were given have now fallen into ruin, due to poor construction and mismanagement.
The majority of these victims have now turned into a ‘forgotten community’ and they state that the government only remembers them when it is election time. And for the last 14 years they have been forgotten by the politician as well as the government servant once the election cycle is done and dusted.
These victims recently expressed their disappointment over the construction of houses given to them after having lived in temporary shelters for several years, undergoing numerous hardships, since that fateful day.
Houses abandoned
Most of these housing schemes are located in Kosgoda, Ahungalla, Balapitiya, Godagama, Telwatte, Galagodawatte, Ratgama, Gonapinuwala and Walahanduwa in the Galle district and in Midigama in the Matara district.
In addition, the Hambantota district had the Hangama tsunami housing complex also known as the Hangama – Sri Lankan Friendship Village donated by the people of Hungary. This has been abandoned by the recipients as they proved to be unsuitable for human habitation. Further, these were built on land belonging to the government. As the people have left, certain houses have been given to the families of the police. Prior to that, tiles, timber, door and window frames had been stolen. The people pointed out that this was a waste of foreign funds, and the relevant authorities had not taken any action to monitor the building materials purchased to construct these 100 houses.
The government at the time had specified that a minimum sum of Rs. 500,000 would need to be spent on the construction of a single house. The Hungarian­ – Sri Lanka Friendship Association however had spent only Rs. 200,000 per house. Their plan had been to increase the number of houses by cutting down on the cost of a single house, revealed a former resident.
This is not the first tsunami housing scheme to be abandoned.
A few years ago, a foundation-laying ceremony was held for one of the largest tsunami housing schemes at Ratgama, known as the Galagodawatte Tsunami Housing Scheme in the Galle district. These houses were donated by the Dharma Foundation in the United States. Many US citizens, including famous Hollywood artistes, had donated funds for it. It was reported at the time that even the prisoners had donated funds for the Galagodawatte Tsunami Housing Scheme.
A consultant attached to the Urban Development Ministry accompanied the writer, during the construction phase of the housing scheme, to make a surprise visit to several housing schemes including the one at Galagodawatte. On that day, he witnessed shallow trenches being cut for laying foundations and he immediately stopped it and a representative of the contracting company tried to give numerous explanations with regard to what they were doing.
Several years later, the occupants of these houses complain of the inferior timber used in the houses. Roofs of many of the houses have collapsed, but neither the Divisional Secretariat nor any other relevant authority has intervened to resolve these problems.
The shallow toilet pits constructed using small cylinders are already full. Further, the walls of many of the houses are seen to be cracking. The roofs are leaking, and the houses in low-lying areas have been submerged due to rains, as no proper drainage system was found.
The residents complained that many of the sub-contractors handling the project had employed inexperienced masons and carpenters for lower wages than usual in order to gain a higher profit.
Over 50 residents have left these houses at Galagodawatte, and these houses are now covered by shrub jungle.
Due to lack of coordination in the distribution of houses, there were also many instances where one family had obtained around three houses from the NGO.
Recently, the remaining occupants had informed the Galle District Secretariat about the condition of the toilets of Godagama Tsunami Housing Scheme and requested that they send a gully bowser to clean it. Their request was transferred to the Hikkaduwa Divisional Secretariat for necessary action. But the Hikkaduwa Divisional Secretariat is yet to heed their request and resolve the issue.
Godagama was one the coastal villages in the Galle district to be among the worst affected by the tsunami and is in close proximity to Peraliya, where the largest train accident during the tsunami took place.
Container houses
The Spanish government which came forward to help those affected in the tsunami had decided to supply many victims with container houses. At the beginning, there were 20 container houses at Godagama. It was however reported that more than 100 such container houses have been dumped in a container yard at Peliyagoda. During the handing over of these container houses at the time, a representative of Spain had revealed that each of those houses cost around Rs. 300,000.
For nearly six months since these houses arrived in Galle, they had not been handed over to the people in the area who were affected. Finally the villagers broke open the container houses to occupy them. Although the container houses reached Sri Lanka with numerous household items including, air conditioning units, the villagers complained that they received nothing. It was just a container, with no house, they stated. The occupants of the container houses eventually dismantled the containers and started to sell them off as scrap iron.
Sirikandura Tsunami Housing Scheme
The Sirikandura Tsunami Housing Scheme is yet another unsuccessful housing project found at Ratgama. An organization called NEXT donated 165 houses to victims of the tsunami. In the construction of these houses, certain newly invented material had been used. The prefabricated concrete made of a plastic net had been used to build the houses. Many of these houses collapsed in a few months causing health hazards to the occupants. Young children suffered from skin ailments due to the cement dust, and some the recipients left this housing scheme. Chief Incumbent of the Vijayarama Temple in Ratgama, Ven. Dodanduwe Wimalarathana said at the moment 100 houses were occupied, whilst 50 houses were abandoned.
These houses are located on the Sirikandura coconut estate, but the occupants who were engaged in fishing as their livelihood used to live on the beachfront before the tsunami. They had found it extremely difficult to continue their livelihood as the tsunami housing scheme was located too far away from the sea.
The majority of those displaced by the tsunami today live below the poverty line and many families find it difficult to make a daily living.
Daluwathumulla is a suburban village of Hikkaduwa where the tsunami affected have been provided with houses donated by numerous NGOs, both local and foreign. The tsunami brought in a flood of NGOs eager to build houses for those affected, and they were all in a haste to construct these houses. K.D.W. Dharmadasa and K.G. Jayantha of Godagama revealed that almost all the tsunami houses by now are severely dilapidated. None of those NGOs are in existence now.
They say that the Hikkaduwa Divisional Secretariat did not pay attention to their grievances because these houses were constructed by NGOs.
