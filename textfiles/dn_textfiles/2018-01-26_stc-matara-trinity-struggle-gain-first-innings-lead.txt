STC Matara, Trinity struggle to gain  first innings lead

Newcomers to the division one arena St Thomas’ College Matara with two wickets in hand were 14 runs short of surpassing Trinity's first innings score of 122 when play was called off due to bad light on day one at the Uyanwatta Stadium Matara yesterday.
The Thomians decision to field first paid off when they had Trinity one down for no score. Hasintha Jayasooriya was unfortunate to be run out for 44 and Lahiru Dilshan was rewarded with a five wicket haul.
Trinity bowlers then had the Thomians 69/7 but a 35-run eighth wicket partnership between Kavindu Ridmal (19) and Gishsnthika Jayaweera saw them to 104/8.
Trinity skipper Trewon Percivel captured five wickets conceding only 11 runs off a dozen overs
Scores: Trinity 122 in 44.3 overs (Hasintha Jayasooriya 44, Abishek Anandakumara 19, Lahiru Dilshan 5/17)
STC Matara 109/8 at close in 41.3 overs (Gishanthika Jayaweera 28 n.o., Trewon Percivel 5/11)
