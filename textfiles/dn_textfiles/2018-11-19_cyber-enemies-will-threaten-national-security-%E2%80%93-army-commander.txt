Cyber enemies will threaten national security – Army Commander

Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake said the Army now has to battle against Cyber enemies.
The Army Commander was speaking at a press conference at the Hilton Hotel in Colombo on Tuesday.
The press briefing was held to make aware journalists of the 75th Anniversary of the Army Signal Corps.
He said the Army should be well equipped to identify cyber threats.
“We have to battle against cyber related threats that endanger national defence,” he said.
The Commander told that even developed countries face great difficulties in battling against cyber threats. He assured that the symposium organised by the Army would become a stage to discuss those challenges.
The Signal Corps provides communication and information technological support for the Army.
During the war against the LTTE, the Signal Corps had played a pivotal role in it by providing ICT and EW support as well as an Infantry role, having formed Reinforcement (RFT) battalions.
The symposium and the ICT exhibition will be held on November 28 and 29.
