National Poson Festival commences

The National Poson Festival celebrations commenced in Anuradhapura yesterday with more than 200,000 devotees attending the event. Anuradhapura Government Agent R. M. Wanninayake and the National Poson Festival Committee expects one million devotees to visit Anuradhapura and Mihintale during the following days. Government Agent Wanninayake appealed devotees not to use polythene, while refraining from consuming alcohol or drugs and avoiding indecent behaviour during their visits.
With the aim of thwarting substance abuse during the festival, the Presidential Task Force on Drug Prevention (PTFDP) had made preparations to conduct a week-long counter-drug operation. Matters regarding the operation were discussed at the Anuradhapura Railway Station, recently, during an event that was headed by Presidential Secretariat Programme Coordinator Nalin Amarasinghe.
Police and excise officers as well as public health officers and non-governmental organisation (NGO) members were briefed on the operation.
Anuradhapura Additional Government Agent Anoma Manel and Anuradhapura Senior Superintendent of Police Thilina Hewapathirana were also present. The theme of the programme is A country Free of Alcohol and Drugs.
The Lake House-sponsored three-day Poson aloka pooja at Mihintale was inaugurated yesterday by Buddhasasana Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera and Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Dr. Wijedasa Rajapakshe. Women and Child Affairs Minister Chandrani Bandara and Social Empowerment Minister P. Harrison also participated in the inauguration ceremony.
