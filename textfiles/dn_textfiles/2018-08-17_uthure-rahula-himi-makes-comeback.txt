Uthure Rahula Himi makes  a comeback

Uthure Rahula Himi, a stage play that made waves in the 1980s cultural circle will revive its creative spirit with a new cast. First produced in 1984 by veteran artist, Sugath Samarakone, the stage play is based on the western popular drama traditions depicting the lifestyles of popular characters of that era including their style of talking and behaviour in a captivating manner. The play was banned on many occasions as the then government came in for a huge flak with its undercurrent themes. Milinda Perera will be featuring the lead character in the play. The preview of the play is now available on the Internet.
To coincide with the revival of his once-controversial stage play, Sugath Samrakone has begun work on his latest cinema production titled Yakshadeshaya. Sequel to Vijaya Kuveni, the film deals with the chapter and verse of Sri Lankan history chopped down by the official chronicle, Mahawamsa.
