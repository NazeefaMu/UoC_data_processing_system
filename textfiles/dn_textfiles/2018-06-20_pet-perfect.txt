Pet perfect!

This is a tale. A tale of a very obedient dog.
Makeup artist Jasmine Schofield was just minding her own business in the café of a coupon and online ad agency in Silicon Valley, California, when she noticed something out of the corner of her eye. Something soft. Something small. Something still. There, waiting just outside the café’s perimeter was a dog. A little smiling dog. With its lead on the floor next it. The dog must be able to read, as there was a ‘No dogs allowed’ sign up on the café wall, preventing him from entering. So he didn’t. And he waited. Like the obedient doggo he is.
After posting the pics to Twitter, people seemed impressed and then concerned for the pooch – how long did he have to wait before someone brought him a puppuccino?
Thankfully, dear reader, not long. “His owner was right outside of frame, he only had to wait maybe a minute or two,” explained Jasmine when a Twitter user raised concern for the dog.
She also dished on the perks of working for her company, when she revealed that everything in the café is free. “We’re lucky enough to have lunch provided to us through the company,” Jasmine says. It is obviously a #blessing that dogs are allowed in this building but we feel like they should be allowed in the café too.
