Call to increase funding for cooperative sector

The leaders of the Co-operative Federations in Jaffna met their parliamentary representatives at the Jaffna District Co-operative Council office last week to ask the Council to request the central government to increase funding and resources to the cooperative sector in the region through the upcoming 2018 Budget.
They pointed out that the three-decade war had resulted in the “destruction and looting of assets” of cooperatives in the North and East, for which “no compensation had been received”. They asked that the government provide compensation for these losses so that it can be utilised to increase production and create employment across the district.
In a press release, the Cooperative Federations in Jaffna asked that the government “make the necessary finances available to increase the capacity and reach of rural co-operative banking services” as Co-operative Rural Banks and Thrift and Credit Co-operative Societies were a credible alternative and should be strengthened to provide rural credit. This was important as the poorer sections of society were increasingly being trapped by high-interest rate loans of microfinance institutions.
The provision of such facilities to cooperatives, they said would help “the provision of low-interest rate loans that are accessible to rural communities, especially those that are geographically remote, and promote and enable savings of rural people and for such savings to be reinvested in their rural economy”.
The Federations asked that the government provide capital investments to the Cooperatives to increase production and facilitate “access to low-interest working capital schemes”.
In addition, they asked that the Budget 2018, re-establish the tax exemption status for cooperatives to further encourage production.
