Tours, players...consistency and injury vs recovery

Greetings rugby fans and a Sri welcome to this week’s tour special.
Apologies upfront ìf thè yards skin a few knuckles on the way home.
Definitely a few difficult pills to digest but absolute pre-requisites.
Both our senior teams having a decent leg 1 at the Happy Valley Racecourse in Hong Kong.
The astro grass HKRFC pitch stimulating mixed emotions from all teams without artificial grass at home.
Grand step if the powers that matter question the wisdom of such a series opener.
Not all ARFU members with adequate astro facilities at home....making it fair prep for all teams on the card for the HK leg.
Naturally then, and little cheeky nudge about our Cup winners this leg...Japan, HK, China, Philippines, etc...well set with no need to physically adjust to playing conditions.
For us islanders...aloha boots on fire, more bounce...and plenty of friction burns for brave warriors not familiar and ..” tubi-grip” friendly.
We managed to fly home despite typhoon warnings and multi curious rice congee breakfast buffet options?
Boys ran thru Philippines, showing pleasing fitness and form.
Fair result playing minus 5 regulars.
But still concerns about our set quest in Sri Rugby...to knock Japan and Hong Kong off the top slots.
A realistic challenge that blueprints our 7s pathway in Asia and beyond.
Then top order for our fellow deckchair experts...to kick off our beach slippers...and breathe easy that my 14yrs for Sri on the international 7s circuit has some practical impact and new history.
The girls finally finished Plate champs beating on outside with pace...no. 5 is mighty familiar.
We were Plate winners 2yrs running looking at no.3...my belief in creating consistent capable warriors, not absorbed at the time.
Now thankfully 3 seasons on...the mind energy much better and professional thinking more significant for our 7s future.
Contemplating the remaining 2 legs of the Asian series 2018,critical news that we are struggling nagging injuries with both our squads.
Muthu, Danushka, Jason, Gayan and Kavindu...are woes for coach Woods.
Tough shoes to fill...tougher for selection and Rohan Abeys thinking team...marking the step ups and our push for a top 2 finish in Colombo this October.
The girls also under pressure with captain Hemakumari limping off in HK...and bigger loss in ex skipper Randika fracturing ankle ...during the last 3mins of the Plate final. She’s our no. 1 forward.
The work load now to Wasana W for impact and huge work rate.
All told a decent start to our Asian ambitions.
Let’s anticipate effective planning to sharpen our thinking and performance ...under pressure in the middle.
Big heart...big mind...bigger petrol.
Bula bula our 7s players and pure pride for the flag.
7s is the game Sri Api our island fame.
Cheers Cheers.
