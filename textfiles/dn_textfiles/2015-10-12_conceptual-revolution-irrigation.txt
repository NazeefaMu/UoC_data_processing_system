Conceptual revolution of irrigation

Late J.R. Jayewardene had a big vision for the country through Mahaweli Programme, but he was able to achieve only a part of that vision. As originally planned, the present phase of Mahaweli should be social and economic development of the families settled in Mahaweli areas by promoting food production in sustainable way to gain the return on investment on capital cost incurred on infrastructure constructed in delivering water to fertile lands in the dry zone. Unfortunately, still it is being perceived as another construction or rehabilitation project with no dynamism for economic gains or a want or desires to increase the food production.
The main drawback is that there is no positive action by the government to assist the farmers to achieve the true potential of their fields. The potential available with Mahaweli lands could easily help to bring the country to self-sufficiency in healthy foods provided it is managed with right vision. The rejuvenated Mahaweli project should be perceived as a great food production area with multiple potential. The functions of Mahaweli staff in the present context must be clearly articulated to them and they have to be given all the support that they need to make a success.
New concept

Former President J.R. Jayewardene
There is a need to introduce an approach to induce a role of Production Managers to the existing management system. For example, the term Block Manager in Mahaweli Management System was used during the construction phase in the 70s because areas have been blocked for the purpose of managing construction and settlement activities. Now the project is in the production phase. Therefore the Block Managers appointed earlier should now be named as Regional Production Manager. The very word BLOCK implies negative at the production phase.
The role of a Production Manager replacing Block Manage is completely different discipline from what was adapted during construction and human settlement phase. In the current production phase, Irrigation projects should be perceived as Food Producing “Factory” where water is the main raw material. Production Manager’s focus should be to maximize food production to cater the market needs earning profits for farmers who are the owners of the “factory”. In addition to water, farm labour, fertilizers etc. are other inputs. Canal systems within the project area are just “Belts” conveying raw materials (water) in a Typical Factory. In this perspective, unless, they are ready to accept the challenges of production engineers, the role of irrigation engineers would be similar to typical mechanics responsible for maintaining machines in a conventional factory.
In view of above observations, there is need for a paradigm shift at national level in managing irrigation projects. In the new management paradigm, the farmers would be treated as clients, not the servants at the mercy of receiving water according rigid schedules decided by irrigation management staff. In this approach, the main purpose of irrigation is to deliver water to the farm at right time in right quantity. In addition, the management objectives should be focused on producing food in healthy way, profitably without polluting the fields and ground water aquifers. Main pollutants are agro-chemicals in the irrigated agriculture. It is very pathetic to observe that main clients of irrigation projects (farmers) are now dying of various diseases caused by indiscriminate use of agro-chemicals. Therefore there is a need to minimize the damages caused to the ecosystems where these food production areas are located.
Existing management staff should either be trained or new recruitments should have Production Engineering background. Water should be perceived as the most limited input which needs to be managed with the farming community jointly. Each Production Manager could be allocated a Fixed Volume of water annually, and their performance could be measured in terms of Rupees earned for the country per Unit Volume of water, while economically upgrading a healthy lifestyle of farmers. In addition to the government salary, the staff should be compensated in the form of incentives calculated in proportionate to income generated by them from their management areas. In other countries, term used to measure their performance is a drop of water to the country. Health of the farming community is also an indicator which should be used to measure the management performance skills.
Present status
We were able to introduce some of the concepts explained in this note during 2000 to 2004 under Mahaweli Programme. Recently we tried to modernize the same concept in System B by independently arranging funds from ICTA.
However due to lack of vision of existing Mahaweli Top Level Managers, it has not yet reaped the full benefits. What I am trying to explain here was also inbuilt IFAD funded project in Iranamadu which is now in progress under funding of International Fund for Agriculture (IFAD). However our irrigation engineers, who dominate the decision making, are not very concerned of what I tried to explain above based on my past 30 years of experience in the same field. Also note that while I worked for the IFAD in a project in Azerbaijan, I was able to introduce same concepts and they are now using it successfully. I do not see any reason why we could not practice here.
What we need is a political leadership to create challenges for our irrigation water management staff.
