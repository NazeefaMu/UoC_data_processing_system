Help him

B.L. Ariyasena of No. 18, Ipitawatta, Thalaramba, Kamburugamuwa, is suffering from Coronary Artery Disease, and doctors treating him have recommended an angioplasty to cure his illness.
The entire procedure and subsequent treatment is estimated to cost nearly Rs. 500,000.
Ariyasena says that he is unable to find money due to his present financial plight. He requests philanthropists and the public to assist his cause by sending whatever financial contribution possible to expedite his treatment.
All contributions should be remitted to account number 73636301, at the Bank of Ceylon, Weligama branch.
