King Dhatusena resurfaces

The latest novel by Gunadasa Amarasekera is based on the life and times of King Dhatusena. King Dhatusena was one of the six kings of Sri Lanka who liberated the country from foreign invaders. He waged a 30-year war against the Tamil invaders. The novel is an attempt to see this period from today’s viewpoint. The reader will find many similarities between that period and the present, when the country is facing its biggest threat since Independence.
Apart from its relevance to the present, it is an attempt to delve into the depths of the human mind through the minds of those characters as surmised by the Mahavamsaya. It is published by Visidunu Prakashakayo and will be available at the Colombo International Book Fair.
