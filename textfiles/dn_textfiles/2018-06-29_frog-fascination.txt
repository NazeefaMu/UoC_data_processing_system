Frog fascination

Juliet Coombe interviews Jetwing St. Andrew naturalist Ishanda Senevirathna about his exciting new book on frogs found in and around the cloud forest in Nuwara Eliya 
“In the end we will conserve only what we love; we will love only what we understand; and we will understand only what we are taught” - Baba Dioum, 1968
To love something you have to understand it and it was on this basis Ishanda set up the islands first frog watching tour in Nuwara Eliya six years ago. A night safari that starts at 7am or 8.30pm looking for frogs in the Cloud Forest behind Jetwing St. Andrews hotel. One guest says of the nightly frog tour “Nothing beats going on a night frog safari with Ishanda the resident naturalist who will show you tiny little frogs no bigger than our finger nail to an amazing forest frog wall.”
The study of frogs goes back to 1735 and yet until very recently the only tour in existence is in Costa Rica. Over the years through different research projects 119 frogs have been documented and it seems103 are endemic to the island (the other16 are mainly from India and other South Asian countries). One of the most loved amphibians is the frog; due to fairy tales suggesting that if you kiss one he will turn into a handsome prince.
Frogs according to naturalist Ishanda’s book `The Peeping Frogs of Nuwara Eliya’, are key to a healthy environment and around the hotel you can see most nights between seven and if very lucky ten different varieties, which are featured in his fascinating full colour guide. The Peeping Frogs of Nuwara Eliya show clearly man and nature cannot exist in isolation and as such we should be concerned when we no longer here the sounds of gribbit near our home garden ponds. Each step we make on this plane has an effect and our understanding of this has never been more important with more and more species becoming endangered and close to extinction.
These adorable characters that come in a myriad of different skin colours, creating the perfect camouflage that protects them from attacks by birds and snakes, surprisingly have only a yearly life cycle. The land frogs are brown with stipples so the birds don’t kill them in the mountain zone, but in the dry zone the enemy is mainly the snakes. In the water they are brownie grey, whereas in the shrubs they are green and yellow and on the rocks they are dark grey making it harder for predators to pick them out. I found it fascinating seeing a male and female toad and the significant difference in size. Also the incredible range of microhabitats so close together and ranging from shrubs, to leaf litter, logs, moss covered rocks in streams, pools, wetlands and even the home garden was full of fascinating signs of frog life.
Walking along handmade stony paths you can live the pages of the book by going on a nightly exhibition with Ishanda who will take you with torches to explore the rocky area with dense forest and here with our torches we find shrub frogs that lay eggs in the shrubs around 2 or 3 at a time in contrast to a leaf nesting shrub frog that lays hundreds of eggs, but have only 5 per cent chance of survival. Amazingly on the cold days the leaf nesting shrub frog will climb 15 metres up a tree and seeing one doing it is a truly extraordinary experience. Also on the cold days the naturalist finds more frogs near the water streams that run randomly down Pedro Mountain.

The tour climbs the rocky out crop to the top where the trees change to the Pygmy trees known locally as the Godwin trees, which are centuries old. This is an amazing experience around the full moon as the forest is naturally lit, reducing your need for torches, to find your way to where black lizards can be discovered sleeping and other night insects that the frogs are busy eating are at their most active. Ishanda says we very occasionally find the forest eagle owl and fish owl. The guests love it when we find the rhino horn lizard and pygmy lizard, the latter of which has a curly tail and hangs from plants.”
No two days or weather conditions are the same as the animals move from one area to another and on normal days you will see around eight varieties of frogs. The one that gets everyone excited is the Montane Hour Glass Tree Frog as he jumps great distances and with his long body he looks like an Olympic decathlete. The body colours brownish orange and the luminous yellow bottom half of the Montane Hour Glass Tree Frog makes him the king of the Mount Pedro frogs.
Years of study show some eggs found, miss out the tadpole phase and in fact come out as frogs in the case of the shrub frog, which is exciting to see against a backdrop of crickets calling to each other continuously, only broken by the sound of water hens in the wetland area, which you return to on our circuit route through the rocks, Eucalypts trees, shrubs and streams. The drizzle and mist add to the mystery of frog watching tours that also take into account the seasonal life cycles.
The noises made by frogs range from clicking, clickerty click to gribbit the more popular sound often used to represent all frogs in movies, when in reality they all have slightly different calls and individually use different calls according to their situations the same way we might shout if angry or talk seductively if courting.
The nightly frog tour is US $15 per person and can be booked through Jetwing St. Andrews reception with Ishanda Seneverathna. To find out more about frogs you can purchase his amazing book at the hotel or direct from Ishanda after the walk.
