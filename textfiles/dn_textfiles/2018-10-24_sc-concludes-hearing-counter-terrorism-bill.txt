SC concludes hearing on Counter Terrorism Bill

The Supreme Court yesterday concluded arguments put forward in support and against the Bill entitled “Counter Terrorism” and all parties in the petitions were directed to file their written submissions before Thursday (25).
Later on, the Supreme Court’s determination over the proposed bill is to be communicated to the Speaker and President.
The Supreme Court bench comprised Justice Sisira de Abrew, Justice Vijith K. Malalgoda and Justice Murdu Fernando.
Several Special Determination Petitions challenging the Bill entitled “Counter Terrorism” had been filed in the Supreme Court by several petitioners including Parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa.
They sought a declaration that the Bill shall become law only through a two-thirds majority in Parliament and the approval of the people at a referendum.
During the oral submissions, Senior Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda appearing for the Attorney General informed the Supreme Court that AG would propose to the Minister of Justice to introduce several amendments to the Bill during the Committee Stages in Parliament.
The Attorney General suggested to amend Clause 27(1)(A), 39, 62, 68(5), 93(3) and 93(4) of the Counter Terrorism bill.
In his petition, MP Weerawansa stated that the concerned bill was presented to Parliament and placed on the Order Paper of the Parliament on October 9, 2018.
The petitioner is seeking a determination that several Clauses of the Bill titled “Counter Terrorism” are inconsistent with Article 1, 2, 3, 4, 12(1), 30, 75 and 83 and of the Constitution.
The petitioner said Clause 2(2) and 3 of the proposed Act restricts the scope and application of the law and Clause 3 read with Clauses 7, 8, 9 , 10, 13, 14 limits the application and operation of the law, which is detrimental to the National Security.
President’s Counsel Manohara de Silva with Senior Counsel Kanishka Vitharana and Counsel G.T. Madubhashinie appeared for MP Wimal Weerawansa.
Senior Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda PC with Senior Deputy Solicitor General Nerin Pulle appeared for the Attorney General.
