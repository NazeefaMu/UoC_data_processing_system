January 8 Mandate Should Be The Focus: Prime Minister

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said despite varied opinions, all must take forward the mandate received on January 8. The Prime Minister addressing the launch of President Maithripala Sirisena’s vision for the Sustainable Era initiative for Sri Lanka 2030 yesterday, stressed that the President was elected on a mandate to not only develop the country economically but in every aspect.
“On January 8, we also received the mandate  to bring about national unity, reconciliation, ensure political freedom, a new Constitution, have transparency, remove corruption and improve the economy of the country. At the same time, all people must reap these benefits,” Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
He said every ministry was formulating their own plans and the economic plan prepared by his own ministry was ready and would be soon released.
“We have had many impediments like the war which hindered our development. But now this is our last opportunity to develop as a country and should not lose that,” he added.
