Human-elephant conflict intensifies in Palagala

People of the Palagala Divisional Secretariat Division of Anuradhapura are affected with the threat of wild elephants. The Karavilagala village situated closest to the Divisional Secretariat Office is the most affected.
Anuradhapura District Secretary R.M. Wanninayaka and officers visited the area recently. Illegal constructions were the main cause for the issue, they said.
Free movements of wild elephants have been obstructed with the illegally constructed houses. A new housing scheme was set up on an elephant passage. Wildlife officers said the elephant corridor should be protected with an electric fence. A few houses have to be demolished to erect the electric fence. But the villagers oppose the move.
