Former APRC champ Gaurav to compete in Pannala

The picturesque Pannala race track will come alive once again on September 8 and 9 when the 'Pannala Circuit Meet' is held. Conducted by the Asian Motor Racing Club (AMRC) in association with the Sri Lanka Racing Drivers and Riders (SLARDAR), the event is scheduled to commence at 3:00 pm and conclude at 10:00 pm.
The Pannala race track is the first purpose built tarmac in Sri Lanka that was later extended to a track with a length of 1.7 Km on a land area of 35 acres (15 acres track and 20 acres bare land and motor cross). The private track considered as one of the top favourite tarmac circuits when it comes to host classy motor racing events. The track has been identified as a tough circuit.
Racing heroes of Sri Lanka will prove their might as they will be competing with Gaurav Gill, the first Indian to win the FIA Asia-Pacific
Rally Championships in 2013, and has dominated the event since securing first or second in the 12 races he has already finished.
Born on December 2, 1981, Gaurav got into motorsports as a rider and competed in the National Motocross Championship in 1999. He moved
to 4-wheel racing and started competing in car rallies, endurance races and signed up for the Raid-de- Himalaya in 2000. He became runner-up in the National Road Racing Championship in 2003 and won the title in the following year. He finished the 2006 season second overall. In 2007, Gaurav won the National Rally Championship with Team MRF and made his debut at the Asia Pacific Rally Championship. He finished runner up in the APRC in 2013 and became the first Indian to win the title in 2014.
With the participation of the crème de la crème of Sri Lanka’s racing, the Organizers are confident that their joint efforts will culminate in a phenomenal experience for both, participants and viewers alike.
