Port workers call off strike

 
The All Ceylon General Ports Employees Union (ACGPEU) has called off the strike they were scheduled to launch tomorrow (28).
ACGPEU Secretary Chandrasiri Mahagamage told Daily News Online the union had decided to call off the strike as President Maithripala Sirisena had agreed to discuss making amendments to the Hambantota Port agreement with China.
Mahagamage further said that the President has called a meeting on August 1 to discuss the new amendments to the agreement.
“If the amended agreement is not beneficial to the country we will once more launch the strike on August 1,” Mahagamage said.
Unions attached to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) launched their strike as of 12 midnight on July 24 in protest of the agreement to lease out the Hambantota Port to the China Merchants Ports Holdings Company Ltd. (CMPort).
