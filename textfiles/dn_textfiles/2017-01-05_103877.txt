Making false bomb threat: Schoolgirl warned, released on bail

An eighteen- year-old schoolgirl arrested for allegedly making a false bomb threat among train passengers at the Colombo Fort railway station was yesterday released on bail by the Colombo Fort Magistrate.
The schoolgirl was ordered to be released on two sureties of Rs.200,000 by Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne and severely warned not to repeat such offences which caused panic amongst the public.
A tense situation occurred at the Colombo Fort railway station on December 26, 2016 after the passengers of the Colombo - Badulla train were evacuated following a telephone call received by the 119 Police Emergency Unit about a bomb.
The Fort Police arrested the schoolgirl who dailed THE 119 emergency hotline on the charges of providing false information to the law enforcement officers and causing a disturbance to the public. Further magisterial inquiry against the suspect fixed for February 17.
