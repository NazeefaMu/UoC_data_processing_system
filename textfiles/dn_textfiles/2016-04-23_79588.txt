Pathana too good for Peterites- win 36-21

Isipathana College dished out a superb brand of running rugby to outwit and beat St. Peter’s College by 36 points (6 tries, 3 conversions) to 21 (3 tries, 2 penalties) in their Singer inter-school ‘A’ Division league rugby tournament match played at Havelock Park yesterday. The winners led 17-5 at half time.
The match got off to a rousing start with both teams battling it out for supremacy. St. Peter’s shocked everyone present at the ground when they drew first blood in the third minute of the game, when off a scrum their vice-captain cum centre Avishka Heenpalla broke through the blind side and sent a beautiful off load to Biyanwila who dummied his way over to touch down near the left corner flag. Fly half Steven Sivaraj missed the conversion and Peters went into a 5-nil lead.
Within four minutes Isipathana hit back to get the equaliser when off a turn over ball winger Padmasanka fed his flanker Weeratunga who formed the overlap and burst through down the right corner flank to touch down for a superb try. Hettiarachchi missed the conversion and the scores were deadlocked at 5 all.
In the 21st minute of the game Pathana centre three quarter Sumudu Rankothge collected a ball off a three quarter move and scampered through brushing aside six Peterite defenders to score a spectacular try far right.
Hettiarachchi once again missed the conversion and Isipathana went into a 10-5 lead.
Isipathana drew further ahead when in the 38th minute off a ruck their tireless prop forward Ekanayake crashed through the Peterite defence to go over for a well earned try. This time Hettiarachchi made no mistake with the conversion and Isipathana went into half time at 17-5.
Soon after resumption in the 48th minute, St Peter’s were awarded a 30-metre penalty and fly half Steven Sivaraj put over it to close the gap to 17-8 in favour of Isipathana.
In the 60th minute Peterites cut the deficit down further when off a penalty they took a quick tap and their hooker Ravin Yapa broke through the blind side off a rolling maul and touched down for a try near the right corner flag, Sivaraj missed the difficult conversion and the score read 17-13.
Soon after in the 67th minute Isipathana scored again, when off a scrum their scrum half set his three quarter line in motion where winger Padmasanka collected the ball and drew the Peterite full back and gave a fantastic off load to his number eight Wageesha Weerasinghe who made the overlap beautifully and touched down for a try midright. Hettiarachchi missed the conversion and Isipathana extended their lead to 22-13.
In the 70th minute St. Peter’s fly half Sivaraj put over a difficult 35-metre corner flag penalty to reduced the gap to 22-16, but within the space of five minutes off a scrum Pathana moved the ball wide through their three quarters where Rankothge sprinted through the Peterite defence to score a try which Hettiarachchi converted for isipathana to increase their tally to 29-16.
Isipathana virtually sealed the match in the 77th minute when their dynamic winger Padmasank who had a spectacular game both in attack and defence collected the ball and darted his way covering nearly 45 metres side stepping many Peterite defenders before sending his co-winger Chamod Fernando over for a sensational try. Hettiarachchi made the conversion once more and the score read 36-16 in Isipathana’s favour.
In the dying stages of the game the Peterites scored a consolation try through their second row forward Perera who bulldozed his way over the line near the left corner flag. Sivaraj once again missed the difficult conversion and Pathana romped home easy winners.
