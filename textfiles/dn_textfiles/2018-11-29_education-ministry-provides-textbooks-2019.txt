Education Ministry provides textbooks for 2019

The Education and Higher Education Ministry has completed printing of 87 percent of the school and Pirivena text books due for 2019.
Although the printed books carried a message from the former Education and Higher Education Minister with a picture, the ministry has not delayed, suspended or prevented their distribution to the children, the ministry said in a press release issued yesterday.
“Pirivena and school textbooks have been distributed to the pupils as usual,” it said.
The ministry is due to print 39.4 million books for 2019 to be given to the students free of cost.
The release further said, steps have been taken to print the rest of the textbooks without delay. They will be distributed to schools and Pirvenas in the island before the end of the year.
