Sound ground-level administration a must – PM

Ground-level administration should function properly and unless it functions well, the entire system of governance in the country would be affected, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Galle.
The Prime Minister was speaking as chief guest at one of several functions held in connection with the opening of new administrative building complexes at divisional secretariats in Habaraduwa, Akmeemana, Gonapinuwala and Hikkaduwa, on Saturday. The entire project costs Rs. 206 million.
With the growth in administrative functions of divisional secretariats with the contemporary government policy of expanding development activities beyond townships to the village, the existing infrastructural facilities at these offices were not adequate.
So Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena launched a project to improve the facilities at divisional secretariats throughout the island, the Prime Minister said.
At the time of late President J.R. Jayewardene’s rule, the then government established a large number of free trade zones (FTZs) in regions such as Gampaha, Katunayake, Biyagama, and Seethawaka.
However, it was late Presdient R. Premadasa, who as a minister of the Jayewardene government, proposed to shift the FTZs to rural areas, Premier Wickremesinghe said.
Subsequently, the first FTZ outside the Western Province was established at Koggala. After remedying a number of practical impediments that existed in the area, the Koggala FTZ was opened and was a great success, he said.
"Now the Koggala Free Trade Zone has the required number of factories and industries. At present about 25,000 to 30,000 youths are employed there."
We are planning to initiate a new FTZ in Weligama and the Southern Development Ministry has commenced preliminary work. With all these industrial development programmes, we have also given priority to develop tourism in the Galle district. These tourism projects will increase job opportunities for youth, the Prime Minister said.
Ministers Vajira Abeywardena and Gayantha Karunathilaka, Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal De Silva, Deputy Minister J.C. Alawathugoda, Galle District MPs Bandula Lal Bandarigoda and Wijepala Hettiarachchi and Provincial Minister U.G.D. Ariyathilaka participated in the functions.
