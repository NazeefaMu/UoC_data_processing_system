Heated argument interrupts Treasury bond proceedings

A heated argument interrupted the proceedings of the Presidential Commission Inquiring into the Treasury Bond issue, yesterday. The argument erupted between the Attorney General's panel and Legal Counsels Chanaka de Silva, Harsha Fernando and Nihal Fernando.
Fernando and de Silva accused the AG's panel of being biased and partial in leading evidence and summoning witnesses.
Chanaka de Silva, the Legal Counsel for former Governor Arjun Mahendran, objecting to the way in which evidence was lead, pointed out to the Commission that the AG's panel was leading evidence to which the Commissioners agreed and advised not to do so. Senior State Counsellor Shaheeda Barrie was leading evidence for the day.
The argument broke as the AG's panel was leading evidence through Central Bank Deputy Governor Dr. Nandalaal Weerasinghe. Dr. Weerasinghe was questioned on the 27 February 2015 Tender Board paper's minutes.
Objecting to the questioning, de Silva asked as to why the Board minutes were not put to Deputy Governor P. Samarasiri who was the ex-officio Chairman of the Tender Board. Senior Additional Solicitor General Dappula de Livera said the reason why the AG's panel did not put the minute to DG Samarasiri is because he has not executed his professional responsibility properly. Harsha Fernando, the Legal Counsel for DG P. Samarasiri, swiftly pointed out to the Commission that this statement very clearly showed that the AG's panel was leading evidence partially. Fernando said that it was a shame the way the AG's panel was acting. He also said the AG's panel was working based on their own conclusions. It was also pointed out that the AG's panel was acting biased when summoning witnesses to testify before the Commission. It was also highlighted that the AG's panel head de Livera used the word 'gallow' in a previous occasion too at the Commission. De Livera said he could take an independent decision and that the Attorney General could accuse anyone who had done wrong.
The Commission made a special statement on its mandate. The Commission said it would not accuse or convict anyone for wrong doing and that it would operate within its mandate. The Commissioners also said they would mention in the special report the Commission was to make, that Dr. Weerasinghe's evidence were his personal opinion only.
The Commission also said the Attorney General could take legal action, if it wanted to, against any party who had done wrong in the Treasury bond issue after the Commission had submitted its report on the case.
