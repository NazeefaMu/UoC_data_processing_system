Cabinet paper to address postal worker grievances - PMG

A Cabinet paper has been submitted by the Posts and Postal Services Ministry to address postal service employee grievances, Postmaster General Rohana Abhayaratne said.
Once Cabinet approval is given, most of the issues of the Postal Service employees can be rectified and their demands fulfilled, he said.
Asked whether moves have been taken to mitigate the consequences of the two day token strike of the Postal Service employees, Abhayarathne said that letters collected at post offices will be distributed promptly.
He added that he is attending on solving the issues and demands of Postal employees. However, he said that certain issues are beyond the reach of him. Such issues will be forwarded to Postal Services and Muslim Religious Affairs Minister M.H.A. Haleem.
Meanwhile the Joint Trade Union Collective of Postal Service Trade Unions Convener H.K. Kariyawasam said there are over 600,000 letters at post offices countrywide.
“The 48 hour token strike is carried out countrywide successfully now with the participation of nearly all employees including the North and East. The normal function of 653 Post Offices, Administrative Offices Sub Post Offices and Central Mail Exchange is stand still now. Our main demand is against privatization of Postal Department resources” he said.
The Postal Services Unions alleged the Government is planning to lease certain main post office complexes, built during the colonial era including Kandy, Nuwara Eliya, Galle.
