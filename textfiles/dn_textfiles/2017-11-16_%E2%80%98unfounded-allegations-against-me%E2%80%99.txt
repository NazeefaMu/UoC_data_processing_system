‘Unfounded allegations against me’

IGP Pujith Jayasundera said he had faced many challenges since being appointed the IGP, which he faced with self-confidence.
“There have also been several unfounded allegations against me which I have completely ignored. The best punishment that can be given to persons making false allegations is to totally ignore them,” IGP Jayasundera said.
Addressing a meeting held in connection with strengthening the community police service, at the Police Crime Division, the IGP said a serious allegation was also made against him during the ceremony held to commemorate the 2nd death anniversary of the late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobhitha Thera.
“People have the freedom to speak but the fact remained that the Police Department had rendered a dedicated service to ensure national security and the security of the people and stabilize peace. The government too has rendered a valuable service towards the welfare of the police service,” he said.
The IGP said the community police service was a dream come true to him. He first introduced the concept in Ratnapura when he was stationed there. However, senior police officers at the time did not understand the value of this service. Later, when he tried to extend it to other areas, there were allegations that he was preparing to contest elections.
“National security is an important factor in a developing country. Threats posed to national security could be best identified at the village level. Intelligence gathered could easily bust serious crimes. As such, the village and its residents should keep constant contact with the police,” he said. The IGP said graduate police officers recruited as community police co-ordinating officers were not expected to idle after receiving their postings. They should have constant contact with the people in the village through village committees. Certain members of the police too were engaged in wrong-doing like the ordinary people. This situation should change, he said.
In his capacity as the IGP, he would not allow any room for errant members of the police. He said the Police Department was at present undergoing a major transformation.
A marks system had been devised regarding granting promotions. Disciplinary action would be taken through the Police Commission against corrupt officials.
He said the benefits of the service rendered by the community police service would accrue not only to the present but future generations as well. Director Community Police Service SP W. A. Priyankara Silva was also present on the occasion.
