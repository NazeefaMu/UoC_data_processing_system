1990 emergency service extended to other provinces: Modi

The Indian-funded 1990 emergency service, currently operational in only the Western and Southern provinces, will be extended to other provinces, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said today.
He was addressing a large gathering of up-country Tamils at the Norwood grounds in Dickoya, Hatton this afternoon, after inaugurating the Dickoya Hospital funded by the Indian government at a cost of Rs. 1.2 billion.
