McLarens amongst the top 25 companies to work for in Sri Lanka again

The Great Place to Work Awards ceremony was held on the 28th of June at The Cinnamon Grand Hotel where McLarens Group received the esteemed award for being one of the 25 “Great Places to Work” in Sri Lanka for the 2nd consecutive year.
The Great Place to Work Institute helps organizations identify, create and sustain great workplaces through the development of high-trust workplace cultures. This year the survey was done based on a study of over 100 companies. The survey is done primarily by assessing whether the employee thinks the company is a great place to work at.
The survey uses The Trust Index Employee survey and The Culture Audit Management Questionnaire.
The former evaluates confidential and anonymous feedback from employees about behavior; respect and fairness at the workplace.
The latter provides information about the company’s value system, programs and practices. “Our employees have been the key drivers for our success and it’s theirdedication, hard work and loyalty thathas been the key to our continued growth and success. Our family like culture ties together all our employees from our subsidiaries and this unity is our key strength” said Shehara Jayawardana, Joint Managing Director of McLarens Group.
