Organizer cum Franchisee and illustrious businessman Roshan Perera, aims to use pageantry to unify, inspire, educate, entertain and celebrate the historical and cultural impact of Sri Lanka.
He states that, “Miss Intercontinental pageant is more than simply a beauty competition, our winner will be an ambassador for this culturally rich and beautiful part of the world. Franchisee Roshan Perera is proud of this year’s finalists as they represent the modern independent women who are self confident. Even with all the glamour and beauty they possess, they don’t depend on their looks solely, as they are all extremely educated and talented.
The winner will represent Sri Lanka in the grand finale to be held on January 27 in Manilla, Philippines. Miss Intercontinental is recognized as one of the top five beauty pageants of the world, while the sash and crown have become pop culture mainstays, the Miss Intercontinental event has grown to become an ultimate show and icon of female beauty and success. Past titleholders have gone on to high-profile careers in government, business, finance, film and fashion. These are women of power and grace, commitment and intelligence, style and substance.
