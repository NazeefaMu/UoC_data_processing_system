Steps to solve graduate unemployment in NCP

The North Central Provincial Educational Information reveals that there are 1000 teachers’ vacancies to be filed in the province. Recently, 488 graduates were absorbed as Sinhala and Tamil medium teachers for the province. According to the level of scoring at the competitive examination and the interviews following it, the North Central Governor's office and the Provincial Public Service Office are considering the possibility of recruiting another batch of graduate teachers for the province.
Provincial Chief Secretary H.M.P. Bandara referring to the issue told Daily News that by December 31, 2016 the number of teachers in the pay list was 15,901 and by July 12, 2017 the provincial teachers for NCP was 16,830. Steps could be taken for filling the balance vacancies by the relevant authorities.
The graduates should be offered suitable employment. The Provincial Council has no provisions to recruit graduates as Development Officers. But in NCP, there is accommodation to absorb 1,200 graduate trainees. Preliminary steps have been taken to recruit 853 for the Trainee Graduates Scheme. We are waiting for the approval of the Economic Policies and Planning Ministry and the Management Services Department to proceed with this matter. If the approval has been given, it will help to solve the burning problem of the unemployment of graduates to a certain extent, Bandara emphasized.
Meanwhile, the graduates who have not been accommodated to be in the Provincial Teachers’ Service who protested to the authorities about the recently held competitive examination and the interviews for the recruitment of Provincial Graduate Teachers, met the Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake and submitted their grievances and the injustice alleged to have been committed in the recruitment process at the Minister's Anuradhapura office. Duminda Dissanayake promised the graduates to take up the matter with the appropriate authorities to give them some relief.
