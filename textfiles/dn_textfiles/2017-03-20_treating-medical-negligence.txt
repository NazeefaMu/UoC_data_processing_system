Treating MEDICAL NEGLIGENCE

The aim of this article is to provide the reader with a clear and concise summary of what medical negligence is. Hence, this short article is focused more on medical matters than the legal concepts of negligence.
Negligence is a lay term common to any profession, occupation, trade, business or affair. It is a civil law concept extensively discussed in the law of delicts. In simple language, it means doing something that a prudent person would not do or not doing something that a prudent person would do and thereby causing damage to a third party. For example, a prudent driver will never want to speed his motor car along the opposite direction on a crowded “one way” road to run down a schoolchild of tender years on a level crossing. When it comes to medical practice, medical negligence could be explained as “doing something that a prudent doctor would not do or not doing something that a prudent doctor would do in the care of patients and thereby causing damages to the patient”. To prove (medical) negligence four components have to be established. They are:
1. Duty of care towards the patient
2. Breach of this duty of care
3. Causation of damages to the patient
4. A direct nexus (causal relationship) between 2 and 3
The doctor should owe a duty of care towards the patient. In medical practice, this is usually represented by the established doctor-patient relationship. This is a strictly professional relationship between a doctor and a patient. Though the doctor-patient relationship is a contractual relationship, documentary evidence is not essential to prove the same. Yet, if documentary evidence (such as bed-head-ticket entries, medical certificates, prescriptions, channeled consultation documents, investigations ordered by the doctor, medical or surgical equipment bought under the instructions of the doctor etc) are available, then it is easier to prove the existence of this duty of care.
This duty of care should be breached by the doctor. This is termed “lack of reasonable degree of care and skill in medical practice”. In medical ethics, we talk about “highest degree of care and skill” towards every patient. Yet, to constitute medical negligence the courts expect a more reasonable and realistic approach from the doctors by expecting only a “reasonable degree of care and skill”. This clause has been extensively discussed in case laws on medical negligence throughout the world.
The expectations of the courts also differ from time to time and from country to country. Different tests have been devised by courts in this respect though the writer does not wish to discuss them in detail. Interested readers are encouraged to refer to few famous English cases such as Hunter V. Hanley (1955) SLT 231 at 217, Bolam V. Friern Hospital Management Committee (1957) 1 WLR 582, Maynard V. West Midlands Regional Health Authority (1985) 1 All ER 635, Bolitho V. City and Hackney Health Authority (1996) 4 All ER 771 and Adams V. Rhymney Valley DC (2000) Lloyd’s Rep. P.N. 777 (41). In a medical point of view, a reasonable degree of care and skill could vary on several matters. Firstly, it varies on the level of education and experience of the attending doctor. It is common sense that the reasonable degree of care and skill expected of an intern house officer with only the basic medical degree and no clinical experience is different from that expected from a consultant with several decades of clinical experience when both attend the same case. Secondly, it differs upon the available facilities.
For example, the reasonable degree of care and skill expected from the same consultant attending the same type of case in two different stations, one being a tertiary care teaching hospital with all modern facilities and the other being a rural hospital in a remote area with bare minimum facilities, would be definitely different.
Thirdly, this differs on the situation too. For example, assume a condition where the same consultant surgeon, in the same hospital attending the same type of operation (for example amputation of the leg below knee joint) under two different situations. One is an elective surgery upon a patient admitted from the diabetic clinic with a chronic non-healing gangrene of foot while the other one is a life-saving emergency operation where a pedestrian is admitted in shock stage with extensive haemorrhage following a run-over traffic accident. The reasonable degree of care and skill a medical man could exercise in an emergency situation may be at a lesser level than in attending an elective procedure performed at leisure with enough prior preparation and planning.
The lack of reasonable degree of care and skill could be by doing something (commission) or by not doing something (omission). For example giving penicillin to a patient with a known allergy to the same drug is a commission while not giving Rhogum injection to a Rhesus negative woman who had delivered a Rhesus positive baby is an omission.
These commissions or omissions could occur at any stage/step in medical management ie: history taking, examination, investigation, treatment or follow-up. For example not extracting a vital piece of information which will be materially significant in medical decision making for the care of the patient, while obtaining the history could be considered as “lack of reasonable degree of care and skill”. If the attending doctor fails to examine the abdomen and elicit basic clinical features of tenderness, guarding, rigidity etc in a surgical casualty with acute abdomen, that is a lack of reasonable degree of care and skill in clinical examination.
If the doctor fails to order an ECG on a middle-aged, hypertensive, diabetic male coming with a classical retrosternal chest pain, that is a lack of reasonable degree of care and skill in the investigation. If a diagnosed patient with purulent meningitis is put only on a simple oral antibiotic, that is a lack of reasonable degree of care and skill in treatment. If a woman undergone mastectomy for a highly malignant form of breast cancer is not followed up in the surgical clinic after discharging from the hospital that is a lack of reasonable degree of care and skill in follow-up.
The third fact needs to be proved for a successful litigation in medical negligence is the causation of damages to the patient. These damages could vary from death (loss of life) to a variety of other conditions to the patient or in the case of a minor to its parents.
How much ever the doctor’s actions are unacceptable and below the normal standards, if no damage is caused, there is no ground for medical negligence litigation. For example, a VOG fails to diagnose pregnancy induced hypertension or gestational diabetes in a pregnant woman. Yet, she delivers a healthy baby on term without any harm to the mother or the baby. In this situation, there is no ground for a charge of medical negligence.
The final (fourth) component is the nexus or the causal relationship between the doctor’s behaviour and the damages. In other words, a direct causal relationship between the doctor’s commission or omission and the damages incurred to the patient has to be established. This becomes fairly complicated at times.
The legal concepts of the theory of causation and remoteness of damage etc. are not discussed here. If the damages are not directly as a result of the doctor’s behaviour, then there should be no charge of medical negligence.
In other words, all four of the above mentioned components have to be proved to establish medical negligence. This was the basis of the Supreme Court decision in the famous Arseculeratne v. Priyani Soysa case. The brain stem glioma the child had suffered was inoperable and was necessarily fatal. Even if the condition had been correctly diagnosed at the initial stage, that does not change the outcome. So, the outcome was independent of the doctor’s behaviour.
At this point, one important fact has to be emphasized. An error of judgment does not necessarily amount to “lack of reasonable degree of care and skill”. This is a matter better understood by the men and women of medical profession than the lawyers, engineers, mathematicians, or statisticians. We, doctors, mostly use the “hypothetico-deductive method” in arriving at a provisional diagnosis. It is an evidence-based method of narrowing down your bunch of possibilities by ruling out certain conditions based upon the information you gather from history, clinical examination and investigations.
The human body does not always comply with mathematical frames. Therefore, if the doctor’s approach to a particular disease presentation is rational and acceptable that itself shows the exercise of a reasonable degree of care and skill. A precise diagnosis or a perfect cure cannot be guaranteed at all times. “We must say and say firmly that in the professional man, an error of judgment is not negligent,” said Lord Denning in Whitehouse v. Jordan which was affirmed by Lord Fraser in the House of Lords in the same case as “…………that an error of judgment is not necessarily negligent”.
This was in keeping with our Supreme Court judgment in Priyani Soysa case though the District Judge went on to claim that in his opinion, “misdiagnosis is no diagnosis”.
Most of the medical negligence cases are civil cases which should be proved on the balance of probability. The burden of proof befalls on the plaintiff, the patient. Unless proven otherwise the doctor is considered not negligent. In cases coming under “res ipsa loquitur” or the principle of “facts speaking for themselves” the doctor has to prove that he is not negligent. For example, in the amputation of the wrong limb, unless the doctor proves to the contrary, he is held negligent for that act. In criminal negligence, a fifth component comes to play a part. That is gross disrespect to human life. For example, if an on-call house officer does not attend to a surgical emergency despite repeated calls from the nurses and as a result, the patient dies of acute haemorrhage, this depicts the doctor’s disregard to human life.
There are few defenses a doctor can stick to in case of an allegation of medical negligence against him. One is the admittance of risk by the patient in the form of written informed consent. This is the legal principle of volunti non-fit injuria. Another approach is the denial of negligence.
The doctor also can claim that it is an inevitable accident or an “act of God”. Contributory negligence by the patient is another defense.
Vicarious liability and delegation of duties/responsibility is yet another approach. These are not discussed here in length.
