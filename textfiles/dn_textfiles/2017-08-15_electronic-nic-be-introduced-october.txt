Electronic NIC to be introduced in October

Steps have been taken to introduce the new electronic National Indentity Card from October this year, said Department of Registration of Persons Commissioner General Vianney Gunatilleke.
The system would be implemented in two stages. Under the first stage, the new electronic identity card would be issued to new applicants as well as persons who had misplaced their present identity card and others who requested amendments to their present card.
Under the second stage, the electronic card would be issued in respect of all citizens by obtaining a register of 1.6 million people which would include all bio-data of a person the finger print and an internationally recognized copy of a photograph.
The Cabinet had approved the proposal to issue electronic identity cards and the respective proposal would be submitted for Parliament approval shortly.
