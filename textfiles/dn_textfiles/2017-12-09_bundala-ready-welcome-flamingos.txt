Bundala ready to welcome flamingos

Migratory birds, flamingos, will flock at the Bundala National Sanctuary during the oncoming season, the Bundala Park Warden said.
He said flamingos arrive at Bundala from Siberia. About 10 years ago, thousands of flamingos used to come there, but in 2014 none came, he said.
Bundala is now in jeopardy due to unruly human activities. He said prolonged droughts dried up reservoirs, streams, and lagoons in the Bundala wetlands.
