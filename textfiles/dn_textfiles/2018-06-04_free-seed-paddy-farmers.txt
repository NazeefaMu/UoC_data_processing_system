Free seed paddy for farmers

The government has decided to provide free seed paddy to farmers who use chemical-free carbonic manure in their cultivations in the coming Maha season, said Kurunegala District Senior Divisional Secretary W.E. Jayatilake, speaking at a meeting of farmers yesterday at Bingiriya Agrarian Services Centre, Kurunegala.
Jayatilake said this programme is implemented by the Agrarian Services Department. About 5,000 farmers are now engaged in chemical-free paddy cultivation countrywide. The government intends to increase this number to 20,000 during next Yala season.
In 2017, about six million kilos of chemical-free rice was cultivated as per the records of the Agriculture Ministry. All necessary facilities are to be provided to paddy farmers who are interested in chemical-free paddy cultivation this year at a cost of Rs. 2.3 billion, he said.
