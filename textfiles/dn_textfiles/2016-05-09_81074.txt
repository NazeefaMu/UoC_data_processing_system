NWP Under 19 and SP Under 19 book final berths

Two unbeaten teams, North Western Province U19 and Southern Province U19 overcoming the challenge of three Western-Province teams qualified to play in the finals of U19 Inter-Provincial Tournament 2016 after they became the best two teams in their respective groups, point wise. These two teams will clash with each other in the three-day finals to be played at R Premadasa Stadium starting on May 10.
Both finalists needed at least a first-innings win in their last group matches, which surprisingly happened to be with their closest rivals in the points table, in order to retain their top positions. Group A leader, NWP had an advantage of 9.855 points over second placed WPN whilst difference between SP and WPS in Group B was 7.14 in favour of SP prior to the last round of group matches.

This was a very tricky situation for the group leaders especially for SP as just a first-innings win would have been sufficient for their opponents to push them to the second slot. However, both NWP and SP claiming first-innings points in their last group matches over WPN and WPS respectively on Saturday secured their places in the finals without a serious challenge from their opponents though Southerners were given an unsuccessful fight by WPS towards the latter part of the match with a view to regaining their lost pride.
