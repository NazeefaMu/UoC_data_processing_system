I was humiliated by gammanpila’s lawyers - Shaddick

Australian businessman Brian Shaddick, a key witness in the alleged financial misappropriation case filed against MP Udaya Gammanpila yesterday complained to the Colombo High Court that a team of defence counsel appearing on behalf of Gammanpila humiliated him in open court while he was being cross-examined by defence yesterday. “These guys disturb me when I am giving evidence.
They laugh at me. This is an insult to me as a witness in a case”, Shaddick added.
The witness made these remarks when the case against Udaya Gammanpila and another accused for allegedly misappropriating Rs. 21 million following their alleged fraudulent share transaction was taken up for inquiry. Meanwhile, Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris appearing for the Attorney General also complained that the defence was trying to dilute the case after insulting the witness, when he was giving evidence. Peiris stated that the defence’s conduct cannot be accepted since it disturbs the rights of a witness in a case.
