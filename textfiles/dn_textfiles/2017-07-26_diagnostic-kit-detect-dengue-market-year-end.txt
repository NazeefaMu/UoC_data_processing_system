Diagnostic kit to detect dengue in the market by year end

A low cost diagnostic kit that could quickly detect dengue will be introduced to the local market by the end of this year, a researcher at Industrial Technology Institute Dr. Maheshi Atapattu said. She was addressing the media yesterday at the Government Information Department.
She said early diagnosis of dengue is important since many deaths from dengue were due to the delay in seeking treatment. Patients come to hospital only when they are in the critical phase. “Most patients who are suffering from fever neglect their disease considering it a normal viral fever and do not undergo a blood test,” she said.
The diagnostic kit which has been developed by using bio technology and nano technology can quickly detect dengue soon after the initial fever starts. “This diagnostic kit will be available in the market at around Rs. 200 and it will have the same features of a pregnancy test which is done by using a strip. The test is executed by immersing the proper end of the strip in urine. The result is readable within a few minutes,” Dr Maheshi said.
This diagnostic kit has been developed during a research conducted by the Molecular Medicine Unit of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Kelaniya supported by the Department of Parasitology and Sociology of the University of Kelaniya, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of the University of Colombo, Anti Malaria Campaign and Dengue Control Unit of the Ministry of Health, Western Province Health Department, Industrial Technology Institute, Institute of Nano Technology and National Institute of Fundamental Studies.
