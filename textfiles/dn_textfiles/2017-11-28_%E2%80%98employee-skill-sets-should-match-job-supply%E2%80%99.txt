‘Employee skill sets should match up to job supply’

The modern world requires young employees with skill sets that engage with the job supply today. With this world that is going forward with technology, the government has seen that it is mandatory to create employee skill sets that match up with the job supply in the world, Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
He was addressing a gathering at the Nawalapitiya High Tech Training Centre on Sunday.
The event was headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe after laying the foundation stone for the new high-tech training centre in Nawalapitiya. There, Minister Lakshman Kiriella stated that there are a huge number of villagers without jobs.
“We cannot give jobs to each and every villager, but we can give the training they need to build up the skill set that the current job supply requires and that is the policy of the United Nations,” he said.
“Giving everyone a government job does not bring a solution to this and that is why we initiated the high-tech training centre. We assure that if anyone gets training from this centre, they will be eligible to get a job in the job market. Ninety five percent of trainees are eligible for jobs, so I request all of you to take the maximum out of it,” he added
The minister thanked Minister Ananda Aluthgamage for giving the idea and to make it a success and stated that it is everyone’s duty to protect the centre as it creates the best opportunity for all of the village citizens.
