We have a talented Finance Minister - Navin Dissanayake

The inapt practice of dominating the Finance Ministry portfolio by Executive Presidents was changed by this government by appointing a talented minister to run the post, Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake said.
He was addressing a press conference held at Sirikotha on May 19.
Minister Dissanayake said he had with the Finance Minister minor differences concerning some policy matters and those have already been resolved amicably.
Minister Dissanayake said Minister Karunanayake took over the Ministry at a time it was passing through dried coffers.
He said allegations are made against all politicians including his father former ministers the late Gamini Dissanayake, Lalith Athulathmudali and former president Ranasinghe Premadasa on many things. Minister Dissanayake said all Cabinet Ministers are bound to respect collective responsibility.
“There were differences of opinion among my father, Premadasa and Athulathmudali. They compromised and settled the issues within. Likewise, we have compromised and settled the policy differences we had. I have no dispute with the Finance Minister. You will see by another few days what sort of decision taken in unison by the President and the Prime Minister,” Minister Dissanayake said.
He said the government ministers need freedom to perform their duties properly and he is enjoying such freedom.
The Minister said that despite the freedom a finance minster gets from the President and the Prime Minister, he has to face other challenges from outside organisations such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as countries with cash-strap economies such as ours are constantly relied on their monetary assistance.
The Finance Ministers are challenged when taking unpopular decisions, he said.
Dissanayake said former Finance Minister Ronnie de Mel was provided with necessary freedom by former President J.R. Jayewardene in 1977 to take critical decisions.
He said that that tradition was changed after Chandrika Bandaranike Kumaratunga elected the President.
Minister Dissanayake disapproved such dominance in the Finance Portfolio said that consequent to such supremacy, former Treasury Secretary P.B. Jayasundera acted de facto Finance Minister during the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime.
