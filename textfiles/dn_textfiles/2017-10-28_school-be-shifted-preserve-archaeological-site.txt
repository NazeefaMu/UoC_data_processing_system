School to be shifted to preserve archaeological site

Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa suggested at the Hambantota District Coordinating Committee recently that the Tissa Maha Vidyalaya in Tissamaharama should be shifted to another place as its land is an archaeological reserve.
The Tissa Maha Vidyalaya is an archaeological reserve with many ruins and artefacts. Southern Provincial Council Education Ministry Secretary Y. Wickramasinghe said a land was already selected to shift the school.
