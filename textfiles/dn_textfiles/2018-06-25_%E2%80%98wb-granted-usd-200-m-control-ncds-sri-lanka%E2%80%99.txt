‘WB granted USD 200 m to control NCDs in Sri Lanka’

The World Bank has granted USD 200 million to control noncommunicable diseases, Health Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Rajitha Senaratne yesterday said.
He was addressing the participants at the 'Eat Wise Drop a Size' health run and the walk organized by the Sri Lanka Medical Association (SLMA) yesterday at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH).
The Minister said non-communicable diseases are responsible for 70 percent of deaths in the world and Sri Lanka too has the same percentage. "We have to reduce the numbers of people with non-communicable diseases," Minister Senaratne said.
"This requires physical exercise.
There is no point of loosing only body weight. One has to drop the tummy fat too," he said.
The Minister said the Health Ministry has already established 1,500 Suwadivi Centres, and Suwanari Centres at government hospitals to diagnose noncommunicable diseases.
He said the concept, "family doctor" will be established in the country. "One doctor would be appointed to 5,000 people and their health condition would be recorded.
The programme would commence in August. USD 200 million was granted by the World Bank in this regard.
The Minister appreciated the SLMA's endeavour to reduce obesity among people.
The winners of the walk were granted gifts. Over 2,000 people participated in the walk.
National Unity and Co-existence State Minister A. H. M. Fowzie, Parliamentarians Sudarshani Fernandopulle, Thusitha Wijemanna, office bearers and SLMA members participated.
