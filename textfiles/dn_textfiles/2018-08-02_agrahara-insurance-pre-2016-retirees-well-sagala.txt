Agrahara insurance for pre-2016 retirees as well: Sagala

The Agrahara medical insurance scheme available for post-2016 retired public servants, was to be extended to public servants who had retired before 2016 as well. Arrangements for the purpose were currently being prepared on the initiative of the Prime Minister’s Chief of Staff; Youth Affairs, Project Management and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayake said.
A sum of Rs.50 million had been set apart in the 2018 budget to implement the programme. A discussion regarding the programme, chaired by Minister Sagala Ratnayake, had been held at Temple Trees on July 31.
The contributions to be made by beneficiaries to obtain the Agrahara insurance cover and the insurance benefits they would receive, were given attention at the discussion.
A ministry release said the pre-2016 pensioners receiving cover under the insurance programme, would receive wider benefits than beneficiaries of other insurance schemes. They include insurance cover for all medical needs and insurance entitlement for life.
It had been proposed to provide insurance cover in respect of treatment in private hospitals and laboratory investigations as well. It would include Ayurveda treatment at home, or indoor treatment at Ayurveda hospitals or government hospitals.
Insurance cover would also be provided to heart operations at private hospitals, cancer, kidney, liver or brain operations. Wider insurance cover would also be provided to purchase hearing equipment as well as for eye operations, total disability or death due to natural causes or accidents.
The minister also explained those features in detail, to the delegates of pensioners’ unions as well as public servants who attended the discussion. The union delegates who showed a positive response also made their suggestions and inputs for incorporation in the proposed programme.
The Agrahara insurance scheme was first introduced by the Public Administration and Home Affairs Ministry through a circular; No. 5/1997; and became operative on January 1, 2006.
