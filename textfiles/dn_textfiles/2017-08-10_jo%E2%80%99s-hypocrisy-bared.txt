JO’s hypocrisy bared

Wimal and Gammanpila of the Joint Opposition who criticised the appointment of the Treasury Bond Commission by the President are going round the country carrying the commission's investigation reports on their shoulders, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister and UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera said.
Addressing a meeting at the Bogamuwa Weheragoda Viharaya to mark the enshrining of sacred relics in a new chaitya build in the temple, Amaraweera said it was he who pointed out an alleged fraud at the Central Bank in issuing Treasury Bonds and lodged a complaint with the Bribery Commission.
"When the Presidential Commission was appointed to investigate the bond issue, it was the Wimal-Gammanpila duo who started criticising it at the outset. Today, the whole country was talking about the disclosures made at the Bond Commission," Amaraweera said.
It was the good governance government which made the appointment of the commission and its investigations possible, he said.
"In contrast, acts of fraud and corruption went unnoticed during the past regime without any murmur or investigation," he said.
The good governance government would never safeguard wrong-doers among them. Any one involved in fraud and corruption would be punished disregarding his or her position or status.
"This is the policy adopted by the President," Minister Amaraweera said.
Amaraweera recalled that several officials who had allegations of fraud and corruption against them had been dismissed by the government. There was an independent judiciary today. The government would never interfere in the judicial process.
He said the new chaitya was built under the ‘Wewak Samaga Gamak’ programme of the ministry.
