Unbeatable Kandy SC stamp their class

At the end of the first round Kandy Sports Club emerged as uncrowned kings of Sri Lanka rugby particularly with an unbeaten record having won all seven games. The side led by Richard Dharmapala comprised the following players Lavanga Perera, Damith Dissanayake, Sashika Jayawardene, Roshan Weeraratne, Keshan Kalhara, Arshad Jamaldeen, Buwenaka Udangamuwa, Thilina Wijesinghe, Tharindu Chathuranga, Jason Dissanayake Suhiru Anthony, Ganuka Dissanayake, Yakoob Ali, Shehan Pathirana, Nigel Ratwatte, Vishwamithra Jayasinghe, Danush Dayan, Danushka Ranjan, Ashan Darling, Uchitha Jayasuriya, Lasitha Aththanagoda, Heshan Jason, Omantha Panthiywantha, Kelum Madussanka, Nipuna Thaak, Diluksha Fange, Malioth Wijesundara, M. Shabeer, Imad Reyal, Sanushka Abeyawickrema, Laskitha Ranaweera, Asitha Ratnayake and Chamika Perera. The success is attributed to commitment and dedication of these players, and the discipline they follow plus good coaching by Sean Wijesinghe and Fazil Marija and keenness of rugby committee chairman Lasantha Wijesuriya, that has really made them a formidable force in the first round.
If Kandy continues to play in this fashion they should have no problem in retaining the league title for another year. The Kandy forwards are very much heady compared to the other clubs - they are fast on their feet, the back division is virtually comprising national players. They now head into their New Year break flying high in the table.
In their last game of the first round which was played last Sunday at Welisara, Kandy SC were given a tough time by the seamen and it was only their last minute penalty put over by Thilina Wijesinghe that clinched the win for them 21-19.
In this game their scrum half Roshan Weeraratne, fly half Nigel Ratwatte and second rower Shehan Pathirana played very intelligently and had the Navy SC XV back peddling with their heady performance. They did all the good work when their team were trying to put their act together. Navy SC proved that they could match up to Kandy SC and did well to prevent the powerful side from crossing their goal line, but Kandy knew how to get things done their own way.
The game began with the sailors scoring first through a penalty from Thilina Weerasinghe and Kandy Sports Club came into game by dominating the proceedings. The sailors when they won possession looked dangerous with their forwards and three-quarters running the ball in splendid fashion and led until the final minutes of the game. Their fifteen were outstanding during the entire game. The three quarters play was a hectic battle where Kandy SC had the edge thanks to some good play by the forwards who clicked well. Kandy SC’s defence was strong, they played in the right areas and the tactics from the boys was outstanding.
In the first round Kandy SC beat Air Force SC 28-14, Police SC 32-23, Army SC 38-10, CR & FC 41-30, CH & FC 38-22, Havelock SC 31-21 and Navy SC 21-19. The present standing is 1) Kandy SC, 2) Havelock SC, 3) CR & FC, 4) Navy SC, 5) Army SC, 6) CH & FC, 7) Police SC, 8) Air Force SC.
Kandy will play their second round on January 5 or 6 against Air Force SC at Nittawela. The rest of the matches to be played at Nittawela are v Army SC, v Navy SC, v Police, v CR & FC, v CH & FC and v Havelock SC.
