Underwater photoshoot with crocodiles

How do you compete with everyone’s breathtaking holiday pictures on Instagram? Outdo them by posing with crocodiles, obviously.
Photographer Ken Kiefer had no qualms about organising a bold photoshoot with carnivorous crocs at Chinchorro Banks in Mexico.
He took a two-hour boat ride with his wife Kimber and model Melodie Trevino for the shoot, before she managed to keep a straight face and pose underwater just metres away from the formidable creatures.
The brave models held their breath as they came face-to-face with the deadly reptiles during the daring shoot.The team used bait to entice the American crocodiles and ensured safety divers were on hand to intervene if needed.Ken, 49, said, “Kimber and I were thrilled to be able to finally get in and create images with these magnificent predators. It is one of those places whose sheer beauty and immensity is overwhelming. My favourite capture is the one of my wife with the boat, safety divers and friends all above witnessing the beauty of the crocodile.”
In the images, the models popped a squat on the ocean floor next to the crocs all the while smizing and keeping calm.
Wearing fabulous red and yellow dresses, Kimber and Melodie kept their composure even as the crocodiles came near them.
The pair still posed looking straight into the creature’s eyes. Metro
