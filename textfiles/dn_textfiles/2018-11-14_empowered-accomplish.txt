Empowered to accomplish

Head Boy Kirthikesh Kirubakaran and Head Girl of Belvoir College International Habishnna Nagarajan focus on becoming valuable assets to society. Perfect Prefects features these two prefects who use their talents and skills to make a better society.
Head Boy of Belvoir College International, Kirthikesh Kirubakaran is calm and collected infecting others with his passion. His calmness allows him to fully exercise his ability to ‘infect’ others with his enthusiasm.
“Young people need role models who show passion for their work and are able to infect others with their passion. Role models should be active in their communities acting in ways that would benefit people. When there is a problem we should learn to remain calm analyzing what the cause of the problem is and take the best decision to overcome the obstacle,” said Kirubakaran
Vanishing demons
Kirubakaran is of the opinion that a mind with the necessary information and a heart in the right place combined with discipline can be a powerful force. The presence of this trinity can make a change because ignorance and ignoring will not make the problem go away. Only through awareness and concern can we make our demons vanish. “I consider Mahatma Gandhi an outstanding individual. He believed correctly that kindness can accomplish so much. Kindness makes the difference. I feel creating awareness concerning the problems in this world is essential and that turning a blind eye is not the correct response. We need to make people aware as to what is taking place in the world. My teachers have guided me along the right path and provided me with the necessary discipline that has aided me in balancing my studies, sports and other activities,” explained Kirubakaran.
People will have faith in your leadership if they understand that you are genuine. If you display the same flaws that they have in their characters then you can’t complain if they don’t follow you.
Correct steps
“I feel that before trying to correct other people when they err, we need to first examine our thoughts and see if the same fault lies in us, and then immediately take steps to correct that which is erroneous.
Then they can have faith in our leadership,” pointed out Kirubakaran.
Crime and poverty are interlinked. While there is poverty there will always be the crime. Poverty can drive people out of their minds.
Desperation can make a man or woman resort to desperate measures. Ultimately we all lose when it comes to poverty.
“I feel that poverty creates most of the demons in society and eradication of poverty is essential. My message to young people is to be bold when facing challenges and do the right thing. I believe in setting goals in life and becoming the best version of myself that I can be,” stated Kirubakaran.
Being well informed can give you more control over your life and Kirubakaran means business.
Business touch
“I feel one of the most exciting events in today’s world is how the IT field is progressing and how technology is developing into an important facet in our lives that is indispensable. I read a lot of business articles so I will know what is happening in the real world and I take an interest when it comes to studying different problems in business. Thanks also go out to my parents for making me the person I am now and supporting me in life. My family is always behind me,” said Kirubakaran.
Head Girl of Belvoir College International Habishnna Nagarajan believes in wellbeing, peace and balance when it comes to mind and body. She also believes in our connection to nature which is an intrinsic part of life.
“I would recommend that Yoga be introduced into the school curriculum as a subject. It strengthens you and increases your powers of concentration. It also brings harmony to both mind and body. Yoga includes breathing exercises which help handle pressure. I do meditation because it gives me a sense of equanimity and refreshes me. I am concerned about Global Warming. Global warming is destroying the earth, we need to take measures in order to reduce it. We can use renewable resources more than unrenewable resources, and reforestation and recycling can be done. I love and admire simple things in nature, such as the incredible hues of the sunset. This revives me. It revitalizes me,” explained Nagarajan.
Disciplinary foundation
It would not be incorrect to say that our lives are measured by the discipline we display. Discipline is also part of wellbeing. Discipline is what creates a foundation for all of life’s pursuits.
“School has taught me a variety of things helping me to build up my character and one valuable skill I have acquired is time management. Time is the predominant factor in everyone’s life. I consider this a gift. In addition to that it has embedded in my valuable leadership qualities and discipline,” added Nagarajan.
Paediatricians share in the creation of life. They care for children and share in the joy of life because children are God’s creation. In caring for children they too share in creation.
“My ambition is to become a paediatrician because I strongly feel that doctors are those who stand after god because they save lives and I wish to render my services willingly. I would also like to say that the best role models I would suggest for young people are their parents because they work tirelessly to bring up their children and they encourage and support their children to achieve their goals. This makes them ideal role models,” pointed out Nagarajan.
Like her Head Boy Kirubakaran, she too believes in facing adversity with courage. Nagarajan advises not to play hide and seek with the obstacles you encounter and be courageous enough to tackle all the problems. Her favourite books are the popular and irresistible Harry Potter series. The story of the boy wizard who also shows great courage.
