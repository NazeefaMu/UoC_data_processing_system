Importance of accreditation for environmental conservation

Accreditation is a third-party attestation associated to a conformity assessment body conveying formal demonstration of its competence to carry out the tasks of conformity assessment. Simply, accreditation seeks for the ability of individuals/organisations in applying knowledge and skills on their respective fields.
Accreditation body is an organisation that provide oversight to organisations, by assessing them against international voluntary standards such as ISO/IEC 17020 (Specific requirements for the competence of bodies performing inspection and for the impartiality and consistency of their inspection activities), 17021 (Requirements for bodies providing audit and certification of management systems), 17025 (General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories), 17065 (Requirements for bodies certifying products, processes and services) etc. This process reduces risk for environment and sustainability goals by assuring them that accredited organisations are competent to carry out the work they undertake.
Effective environmental management system
The role of accreditation has been such diversified as it has expanded its roots into deep in our society. Protection or rather conservation of environment is also one such area where accreditation has made an influence. Out of many approaches, environmental certification schemes is a strong tool that has been widely used for environmental conservation. All such schemes attempt to provide organisations with an effective environmental management system to help them to achieve environmental and economic goals. The current high levels of resource utilization often leads to the degradation of land and pollution of the natural environment. The aim of the move towards sustainable development is to ensure the availability of natural resources for future generations. Within environmental certification the life cycle approach is often adopted, where the life cycle of the product from its production to its disposal are followed to ensure that it is produced, used and disposed of in a sustainable and environmentally sound way. There is increasing pressure on companies to respond to environmental pressure from stakeholders, therefore increasing the use of voluntary environmental regulations such as certification to achieve sufficient social legitimacy and to protect their profits.
Some of the leading certification and verification schemes involved with environmental conservation are Carbon Trust Standard, Eco-Management and Audit Scheme, Forest Stewardship Council, ISO 14001, ISO/IEC 14065, MCERTS. These schemes are mainly focusing on Energy usage and greenhouse gas (CO2) emissions, Water usage management and effluent, Waste management and disposal, environmental performance, responsible international forest management and ensuring sustainable chain of custody, implementation of an Environmental Management System, emissions to air etc,.
The importance of accreditation begins with certification schemes like above where the competency of personal who provide certification under various schemes are assessed. Availability of a certification body that has been accredited has proven that it complies with best practice. It is competent to deliver a consistently reliable and impartial service which meets the appropriate, internationally-recognised standard.
When a particular organisation related to environmental conservation applies for accreditation that will be assessed on the qualifications, training and ongoing competence monitoring of staff, technical competency of people that have the relevant experience and sector expertise, independency and impartiality during verification.
Ecologically sustainable development
In many countries, accreditation is not compulsory. However, it is important to keep in mind that the fact that an organisation is not accredited does not, by itself, mean that it is not a reputable organisation. However, many organisations engaged in environmental conservation choose to seek accreditation in order to be able to demonstrate an independent confirmation of their competence and independence. This will automatically upkeep the effort of conserving environment with higher effectiveness and efficiency.
Though, there is not a straightforward relationship of accreditation with the conservation of environment, indirectly it helps for the environment by assisting in the co-operative implementation of national and international environmental responsibilities, provide for the protection of the environment, especially those aspects of the environment that are matters of national environmental significance, promote ecologically sustainable development through the conservation and ecologically sustainable use of natural resources, promote the conservation of biodiversity and provide for the protection and conservation of heritage and promote a co-operative approach to the protection and management of the environment involving governments, the community, land-holders and Indigenous people.
