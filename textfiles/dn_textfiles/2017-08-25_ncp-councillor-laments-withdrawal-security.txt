NCP Councillor laments withdrawal of security

Says he voted with JO against lease of seed farm:
The two Civil Security personnel provided to the North Central Provincial Council's Joint Opposition Group Member Upali Wijekoon as his personal escort had been withdrawn with immediate effect from 12 noon on August 23. Wijekoon popularly known as ‘War Hero Upali’ lost both his legs in a LTTE bombs attack which killed Lt. Gen. Denzil Kobbekaduwa and Brigadier Vijaya Wimalaratne on August 8, 1992.
Wijekoon said the two civil security personnel were provided to him on a request made to the President through the NCP Chief Minister citing his disability. Wijekoon said he participated in a demonstration held on August 21 to protest against the lease of the Maha Illuppalama Seed Farm to a private company and voted with the Joint Opposition group against the proposed 20th Amendment to the Constitution Draft Bill and he considered this as the main reason for the withdrawal of the Civil Security personnel.
This type of injustice caused to a person who had lost both his legs and managed to save his life from an LTTE bomb which killed 10 other members of his company, was most unbearable, he said.
