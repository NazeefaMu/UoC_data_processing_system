The Japanese Embassy Staff Spouses Association donated Rs. 153,600 to the 'Only One Word' foundation recently.
A total of Rs. 311,350 was donated to two NGOs, the Surangani Voluntary Service and 'Only One Word' at a ceremony held at the Japanese Ambassador's residence, presided by the Ambassador's spouse Akiko Saganuma.
Funds forf the donation were raised through the annual Christmas International Bazaar, held in Colombo.
The donation from the Japanese Embassy Staff Spouses Association will be utilised to support two medical students from Sangamitta College, Galle, who are presently attending the Karapitiya Medical College as first year students.
