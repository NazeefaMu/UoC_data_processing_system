Arsenal’s unbeaten run ends
Liverpool back on top as Shaqiri sinks United

London, Sunday: Liverpool powered back to the top of the Premier League as Xherdan Shaqiri inspired a 3-1 win over bitter rivals Manchester United, while Arsenal’s 22-match unbeaten run was shattered by a shock defeat at Southampton on Sunday.
Jurgen Klopp’s side made it six successive league victories thanks to Shaqiri’s late double after United’s Jesse Lingard had cancelled out Sadio Mane’s opener at Anfield.
Shaqiri’s superb substitute cameo allowed Liverpool to reopen a one-point lead over second-placed Manchester City after the champions had knocked the Reds off the summit with their win against Everton on Saturday.
Liverpool’s first win in their last six meetings with United ended a frustrating streak against the Old Trafford outfit that dated back to March 2016, while also extending their unbeaten start to the league season to 17 matches.
While that was cause for pre-Christmas revelry on the Kop, more significantly, Liverpool’s refusal to be subdued by a United team set up by Jose Mourinho with five defenders was another statement of intent as they chase a first English league title since 1990.
“The way the boys played and fought was outstanding. We saw the line up of United, how organised they were and they fight from the back. I’m over the moon about the performance,” Klopp said.
“The timing of Shaqiri’s introduction was not too bad. We need somebody to score the goals.”
Of Liverpool’s title bid, Klopp added: “We know we are a good team. We had to prove it and keep on proving it.”
Senegal winger Mane put Liverpool ahead in the 24th minute when he broke away from Ashley Young to meet Fabinho’s sublime pass with a nimble piece of chest control before shooting past David De Gea.
United equalised against the run of play in the 33rd minute as Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker made a hash of catching Romelu Lukaku’s low cross and Lingard finished off the rebound.
Alisson’s error didn’t prove costly as Switzerland midfielder Shaqiri struck within three minutes of coming off the bench, his shot flicking off the hapless Young into the roof of the net in the 73rd minute.
Shaqiri ensured Liverpool would return to the top in the 80th minute with a stinging strike that clipped the foot of United defender Eric Bailly on its way past De Gea.
United are now 19 points behind Liverpool in sixth place as the pressure mounts on Mourinho following another wretched display.
Meanwhile, Unai Emery admitted Arsenal need to fix their leaky defence after Southampton’s Charlie Austin punished a howler from Bernd Leno to stun the Gunners in a 3-2 victory.
Austin settled a thrilling clash at St Mary’s when he headed home with just five minutes left after Arsenal goalkeeper Leno misjudged Shane Long’s cross.
Southampton had twice taken the lead through Danny Ings, only for Henrikh Mkhitaryan’s brace to draw Arsenal level on each occasion. AFP
