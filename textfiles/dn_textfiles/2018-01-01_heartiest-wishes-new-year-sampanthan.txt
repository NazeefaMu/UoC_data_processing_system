Heartiest wishes for the new year: Sampanthan

My heartiest wishes to all the people in this country for a prosperous and a happy new year.
As we welcome this new year with hope and expectations, my prayer is that as people of a united country, we would work towards creating a better future. May we take the positives and work on the lessons learnt during the past year as we march towards in this new year.
As we begin this year, my appeal to all political parties and leaders is to come together to find a lasting resolution to the longstanding national issue of this country and pave a way for a better future for our future generations.
Wishing everyone a happy and a blessed new year!
