Homagama incident shows need for Bikkhu Kathikawatha Bill - Prelate

The unruly behaviour displayed by a group of Bhikkhus opposite the Homagama Courts Complex highlighted the urgent need for the adoption of the Theravada Bhikkhu Kathikawatha Bill, said History Lecturer at the Peradeniya University Ven. Prof. Hanguranketha
Dheerananda Thera, He said according to our cherished cultural values, Buddhists acted in accordance with the examples set by the Maha Sangha. Therefore, the unruly action by a group of Bhikkhus who had a duty to be an example to others could never be condoned. He said violence was not the means to settle problems and issues. All religions for that matter abhorred violence. Since the country was peaceful there was ample opportunities available to settle problems through discussion. Bhikkhus would not have misbehaved in this manner if a Bhkkhu Kathikawatha had been in force.
