Moody’s affirms Sri Lanka’s ratings at B1

Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) has affirmed the Government of Sri Lanka’s foreign currency issuer and senior unsecured ratings at B1 and maintained the negative outlook.
The decision to affirm the rating at B1 reflects Sri Lanka’s progress in implementing the planned reform program, which entails fiscal consolidation and a build-up foreign exchange reserves buffers, ahead of the end of the IMF Extended Fund Facility program in June 2019, along with its moderate per capita income levels, and stronger institutions relative to many similarly-rated sovereigns.
This is balanced against Moody’s expectation that the sovereign’s fiscal strength will remain very low and government liquidity and external vulnerability risk will remain rating constraints. The decision to maintain the negative outlook reflects Sri Lanka’s ongoing high vulnerability to a potential tightening in external and domestic financing conditions, given relatively large borrowing needs, reliance on external funding and still low reserves adequacy.
