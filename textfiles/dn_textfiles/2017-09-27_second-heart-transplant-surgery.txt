Second heart transplant surgery

The group of doctors who successfully performed the first heart transplant surgery at the Kandy General Hospital were to carry out the second heart transplant surgery at the hospital last night to save the life of Sachini Sewwandi.
A heart was to be harvested from a youth who was declared brain dead following an accident,with the consent of his relatives.
This transplant planned at the Kandy General Hospital was abandoned at the last minute on September 19 due to a tug-o-war between consultants not to remove the beneficiary’s heart. This situation has arisen even after the heart was harvested from the donor and fixed to a machine pending the transplant. However, doctors have agreed to perform the transplant again after a discussion with Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne.
