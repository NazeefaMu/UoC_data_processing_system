SL-SA TEST series reviewSteve Smith’s Aussies suffered same fate as no. 1 side
Now No. 2 ranked Proteas falls to spin

Like Steve Smith’s Australians two years ago, the South African team led by Faf du Plessis arrived in Sri Lanka as the no. 2 ranked Test team in the world with high hopes of keeping intact their new found away record. But to their dismay after the two Tests which they lost rather comprehensively by margins of 278 runs and 199 runs well inside four days they found that they were not the competitive side they thought they were, especially on dry spinning tracks of the subcontinent.

The South African batsmen brought up largely on pitches that had pace were exposed to the hilt against high class spin on pitches they hardly encounter at home. Their techniques to play against spin was brought into question in the series and left them with enough to think about and work on before they tour India next year.
Smith’s team ranked no. 1 suffered the same fate as the South Africans, being whitewashed 3-0 in the Tests with their batsmen unable to come to terms with turning pitches and the discipline with which the Lankan spinners, headed by spin master Rangana Herath posed.
South Africa came to Sri Lanka with high hopes that their fast bowling unit comprising Rabada, Steyn, Philander and Ngidi would be able to run through the Lankan batting even on dry tracks using reverse swing as their main weapon. But to their disappointment they were unable to do that and the Lankan batters were able to counter them quite successfully. Most disappointed would have been Dale Steyn who managed only two wickets that left him still one short of becoming South Africa’s leading wicket-taker in Tests. The absence of reverse swing had a big effect on his bowling as it was the one that contributed largely to his last visit to Sri Lanka in 2014 when he captured 13 wickets (avg 17.46) in two Tests and played a decisive role in his country’s 1-0 series win.
DIMUTH CORNERSTONE
Opener Dimuth Karunaratne was the cornerstone of the Lankan batting. He alone stood head and shoulders above everyone else getting past fifty in each of his four innings in the series to total a handsome 356 runs and average over a hundred.
With Karunaratne solid at one end Sri Lanka were able to build on partnerships which the South Africans failed to do with their batting. Having missed the series in the Caribbean due to a fractured finger and using the Sri Lanka A tour to Bangladesh to play himself into form, Karunaratne was at the peak of his form when the South African series started and he immediately made an impact in the first Test at Galle with a monumental knock of 158 not out that simply knocked the fight out of the Proteas. He maintained that form throughout the series by adding three consecutive fifties to that score to deservedly win the Man of the Series award.

The South Africans could not find a single batsman good enough to combat the Lankan spin threat and hold up one end like Karunaratne and they collapsed to paltry totals of 126, 73 and 124. Where they would have erred was in trying to stick to their three-man pace attack even in unhelpful pitches instead of balancing the side with two spinners. At Galle they played two spinners plus three fast bowlers and weakened their batting and at the SSC they decided to go with only one spinner and strengthened the batting. That they clearly lacked another spinner at the SSC was proved by left-armer Keshav Maharaj who single-handedly ran through the Lankan batting taking nine wickets in the first innings and a match bag of 12.
Theunis de Bruyn did not disappoint his selection and showed the rest of his teammates what they have been missing by taking on the Lankan spinners to score his maiden Test hundred and with Temba Bavuma who scored a half century put on the only century partnership for South Africa in the series for the sixth wicket. Thanks to their liaison South Africa were able to come up with a decent total – 290 in comparison to their previous three efforts. Although it was a vain attempt, their batting would have given them confidence for the upcoming five-match ODI series that starts at Dambulla on Sunday.
WORST TEAM AGAINST SPIN?
Many teams have toured Sri Lanka including South Africa in the past but although they lost series they have never displayed such poor quality batting against spin than Du Plessis’ side. The techniques they adopted to tackle spin was blatantly exposed and made the Lankan spinners look as if they were unplayable on any surface.
Sri Lanka no doubt possess a spin combination as good as any in the world with Herath being the kingpin of the attack supported by the off breaks of Dilruwan Perera, the mystery spin of Akila Dananjaya who bowls four varieties and the left-arm chinaman deliveries of Lakshan Sandakan. This quartet wrought havoc with the Proteas batting accounting for 37 of the 40 wickets to fall in the series.
It was a series where spin dominated over pace and Suranga Lakmal the stand-in captain bowled just 6.3 overs in the entire series. He was the only paceman picked for the two Tests and he hardly handled the new ball because throughout the series Sri Lanka opened the bowling with their spinners.
The stranglehold the Lankan spinners had on the South African batsmen didn’t as much test their batting for apart from Karunaratne’s contribution there was hardly anything substantial from the rest. Danushka Gunathilaka, Karunaratne’s opening partner made twin fifties on his home ground at SSC and Angelo Mathews and Dhananjaya de Silva made a half century apiece. Apart from them Kusal Mendis, Roshen Silva and Niroshan Dickwella hardly made an impact with the bat.
The fact remains that Sri Lanka without the services of their captain Dinesh Chandimal and coach Chandika Hathurusingha have won their last three Test matches – one against West Indies and two against South Africa. Sri Lanka’s series win over second ranked South Africa has brought them level on ratings with England on 97 although they remain in sixth position. England are Sri Lanka’s next opponents in November and the three-Test series will be eagerly awaited.
The tour in fact brought into question the rationality of visiting sides playing warm-up matches ahead of a Test series and whether it serves any purpose at all. As Dean Elgar the South African opener pointed out the pitch they got for their two-day game was a flat surface and the ball hardly spun compared to the ones they got for the Test series. It was vice-versa when Sri Lanka toured South Africa in 2016/17 where they were provided with slow turners for the practice match in comparison to the fast bouncy tracks they encountered in the Test series.
