pm informs at Party Working Committee meeting:
UNP members barred from criticising President

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday informed the membership that they should not criticise President Maithripala Sirisena in public for any reason.
Presiding over a UNP Working Committee meeting, the Prime Minister informed the party membership to contact him if they had any problems.
He said politicians belonging to the party including all Ministers and Parliamentarians should refrain from criticising the President whatever crisis existed politically.
At this meeting, it was emphasised that the Bond Commission report had been used to sling mud against the UNP. Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva pointed out that Perpetual Treasuries Ltd had earned unconscionable profits by purchasing bonds and selling them to the EPF.
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said a programme should be devised to educate the public about the Bond issue.
Minister Harin Fernando who explained UNP plans to win the local elections in the Uva Province said the UNP could not allow others to dance the merry devil after winning power through a long and protracted political struggle.
Some members pointed out that the SLFP seniors such as Susil Premajayantha and Dilan Perera had been directly targeting the Prime Minister in their criticisms.Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake said correct information should be given to the people if there had been any fraud involving the Bond issue.
All Parliamentarians were also advised to get directly involved in the UNP election campaign both in their electorates and other areas in the country.
The behaviour of certain media institutions in targeting the Prime Minister also came up for discussion and it was decided to take appropriate action against such unfounded criticism.
