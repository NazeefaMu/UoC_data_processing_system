Doctors who refuse to treat and students who refuse to learn

It is a pity that the government has so far failed to act firmly using every possible means including new laws and executive orders to permanently ban strikes by doctors and prohibit the ludicrous boycott of classes by university students who are not workers at all but helpless dependents on public charity. It is hoped that such long overdue prohibitions will be instituted urgently in the public interest. That would not only have a strong moral justification. It would also be extremely popular with a suffering public enduring the abuse of power by doctors and the contempt of spoilt and pampered medical students enjoying the luxury of free education.
It is amazing how the prevailing societal distraction with the ‘SAITM’ side issue has somehow diverted attention from the two monstrous scandals involving the outrageous behaviour of doctors and medical students in this country. That and not ‘SAITM’ is what ought to be the real focus of public attention at this time. Millions of poor people grappling with the daily struggles of life would not even know what SAITM stands for.
Neither would they give a hoot about the chequered history of that initiative. Nor are people interested in the convoluted ideological arguments about private medical education, or the self righteous posturing and double standards of pundits who rant about standards of medical education. Nor do most people care a damn about the ponderous deliberations of a dull insipid body called the ‘Sri Lanka Medical Council’ and its endless meandering over issues under the idiosyncratic leadership of posturing octogenarian showmen. All this is of little or no importance to the vast majority of people in this country.
On the other hand it is terribly important to people that when they go to hospital they should not be turned away and acutely inconvenienced by striking doctors who callously refuse to treat them out of slavish obedience to their ruthless trade union the GMOA. It is terribly important for those who are sick and in pain, who sacrifice a whole day’s pay and crawl to hospital at the crack of dawn to get an OPD number, that their time and money should have been wasted, their suffering prolonged and health endangered - all because doctors are on strike.
It is also of vital importance to millions of ordinary people (who despite their own financial difficulties yet generously contribute to the free education of medical students through taxation) that the fortunate beneficiaries of their charity should narrowly concentrate on their studies, quickly graduate as doctors and start serving the country without wasting taxpayers’ money. The cost of training a single doctor may possibly amount to a stunning Rs.4.5 million in public funds. Therefore it is not surprising if millions of taxpayers should be indignant that medical students who are the fortunate recipients of public charity should desert hospital wards and lecture halls for 8 months, and spend their time doing vigils squatting like street bums inside makeshift shanties and unsightly hovels by the roadside. That is when they are not engaging in mob violence, blocking roads, disrupting the normal life of city dwellers, and causing maximum inconvenience with rowdy street demonstrations.
Medical ethics and morality
People are entitled to their own opinion about SAITM and there are appropriate authorities where such issues should be discussed and resolved. But that does not take away from the abomination of doctors refusing to treat patients whatever the reason. Nor does it take away from the scandal of students enjoying the luxury of free education boycotting classes whatever the reason. These and not SAITM are the real issues demanding firm government intervention on a matter of fundamental principle. The principle is that for doctors to strike for any reason whatsoever is a gross violation of the most basic tenets of medical ethics and morality. It cannot be justified under any circumstances. Equally for medical students to boycott classes for any reason whatsoever is a gross abuse of the privilege of free education. It cannot be justified under any circumstances. That is the bottom line.
For a doctor to turn his back on a patient and refuse treatment is never ever permissible even under the most extreme circumstances. Even if a terrorist on the run were to rush into a doctor’s clinic bleeding from a bullet wound – the doctor is obliged to give what treatment he can and face the legal consequences of faithfully doing his professional duty. Even in the theoretical situation of a doctor being denied his legitimate pay, he is nevertheless momentarily obligated never to turn away a patient. Such are the uncompromising standards of ethical rectitude that are binding on all who enter the medical profession. Such is the glorious heritage of sacrificial service to which every doctor who enters the medical profession is heir. Such are the high ideals of selfless service to which every doctor is called.
The fact is that alongside the police, the military and the fire services doctors belong to an exclusive group of professionals who in the nature of their work simply cannot enjoy the right to strike because to do so might endanger lives. Those who opt to enter the medical profession do so accepting that in built limitation. Doctors who don’t like it are in the wrong profession. Every profession has its own distinctive privileges and disadvantages unique to its particular ethos. One joins a profession accepting the rough with the smooth, the burdens as well as the benefits of a particular professional lifestyle and work ethic unique to itself.
The problem is there are too many doctors who cannot accept this reality and are in the ‘wrong profession’. They include the cantankerous firebrands of the GMOA (and its little piggy tail the “dental GDSA” ever obedient to its medical master). These are the ruthless bumptious union bosses more interested in politics and power play. Many other doctors nowadays are enslaved by money and they have made the practice of medicine into a thriving business. Still others are only in it for the vainglory of rank, title, prestige and public veneration.
Sadly they even include those in universities where great role models who inspire their students are a disappearing species. For too many the relentless drive to amass pedestrian publications in a bid to inflate a modest CV, the egotistic satisfaction of exercising power in some administrative position, and the leisurely life of committee rooms, conference tables and workshops, have replaced the supreme fulfillment of down to earth patient care and student teaching. Finally, to complete the catalogue of doctors in the ‘wrong profession’ there is the growing tendency for institutionalised “medical thuggary” by radicals who incite students, discourage dissent, and bully colleagues into not opposing their agenda.
Sacred values and traditions
So doctors who are in the ‘wrong profession’ have many different faces. What they share is a contempt for the great traditions of service, sacrifice, and dedication to duty in the practice of medicine. Together they corrupt an honoured profession from within. They undermine its sacred values and traditions. They drag whole generations of young doctors down with them into the mire. The fact that such ‘medical misfits’ are to be found in the noblest of learned professions proves that there is something tragically wrong with the way students are admitted to medical faculties. Such admissions are no longer based on 100% merit. Nor is there any assessment whatsoever of attitudes, motivation, background, character and personality in the selection process.
One makes these criticisms with a heavy heart. During a 40 year career in the health sciences I have been privileged to associate with some of the finest and most dedicated doctors in the country. It is my esteem for them and the nobility of the great profession which doctors like them have adorned, that makes one despise those who bring that profession into disrepute in this day and age especially through the abomination of strikes.
Strikes by doctors who thereby deliberately ‘refuse to treat’ is therefore the ultimate corruption of a decaying medical profession infiltrated by misfits and controlled by ruthless trade union activists. Deceptive assurances about maintaining essential services are ploys to fool the public. The truth is that the actual number of people who die, suffer some complication, are acutely inconvenienced, or whose health is in some way compromised by a doctors strike is an imponderable that can never be accurately estimated.
Accordingly with the benefit of public opinion on its side, it is imperative that without further dithering the government should move resolutely to ban strikes by doctors and speedily deliver the nation from the evil stranglehold of ruthless medical trade unions. The case for banning boycotts by medical students and forcing them back to work on pain of expulsion from the university - is just as strong. In this context what opinion one may have about SAITM is quite irrelevant.
University students receiving free education at tax payers’ expense are not workers. They are not eligible for any trade union rights whatsoever. By boycotting classes they spit in the face of their generous benefactors. There is a certain ingrained arrogance in the university student who imagines that he belongs to the cream of the nation’s youth and that consequently the rest of society is duty bound to support his education. Mature academic staff know better, having seen the dull intellectual mediocrity and ugly attitudes of many who have entered university through the back door of district quotas and the putrid coaching of tuition classes. Older academics will remember the sordid tendency for vicious campus violence by the ancestors of today’s striking medical students that has marked the troubled history of higher education in Sri Lanka.
The current instigation of traffic chaos in Colombo by the GMOA follows previous inflammatory rhetoric about students being left with no option but to take up arms. The country is at the mercy of a dangerous coalition of unscrupulous doctors and desperate students whom they manipulate. It is hoped that even now the government will move with resolution to crush their anti-social agenda by legally prohibiting both strikes by doctors and boycotts by students.
