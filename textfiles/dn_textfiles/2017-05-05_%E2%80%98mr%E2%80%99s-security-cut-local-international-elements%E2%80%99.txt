‘MR’s security cut by local, international elements’

The Joint Opposition (JO) yesterday said removal of several officers from the security detail of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was an act hatched by some local and international elements.
JO member, Gampaha district parliamentarian Prasanna Ranatunga told the media in Colombo that reducing security of Rajapaksa was done purposefully after witnessing the large crowds at the JO May Day rally at the Galle Face Green.
He said certain local elements with the support of some foreign elements were trying their best to prevent Rajapaksa from coming back into power. He said the former President’s security reduction was a part of such actions.
Ranataunga recalled that Rajapaksa’s security was reduced following the JO’s meeting at the Hyde Park last year as well.
He said Rajapaksa’s life was still under threat as the LTTE has not given up on targeting him. He said the government must take responsibility if anything untoward happened to him.
