‘Don’t get public officers involved in political battle’

MP Patali Champika Ranawaka recently threatened ministry secretaries that they would punish them for their failure to comply with the resolution passed by the Opposition suspending expenditure headings of certain ministries, UPFA Parliamentarian and Pivithuru Hela Urumaya leader Udaya Gammnapila said on Monday.
“He attempted to instill fear in public officers. In a way, I am glad that he did not threaten that they would disappear like Ekneligoda, would be subject to electric shock treatments like Suki Thilakasiri, would be disabled forever like Sandeep or would be subject to thuggery like Marasinghe,” Gammanpila said.
“As we have repeatedly said, there is no legal basis for the so-called resolutions passed in Parliament in respect of suspending ministry expenditures. We can explain the legal basis. However, we cannot provide a brain for MP Ranawaka to understand the legal analysis,” he said.
“For the benefit of the public, I will explain the applicable law again. Ministries are provided with funds for 2018 in terms of Appropriation Act No 30 of 2017. If somebody wants to suspend the allocations, it can be done by bringing an amendment to this Act. It cannot be done with a motion.”
“Further, according to Article 152 of the Constitution, financial motions can only be brought by a minister with the approval of the Cabinet. Because of their ignorance, they have brought a financial motion being in the Opposition. They now blame the educated public officers for not following a motion which has no legal effect.”
