Navy seizes Rs. 162 million worth of drugs

Sri Lanka’s Naval fleet units on patrol in the Northern waters seized 13.5 kg of drugs worth Rs. 162 million and took into custody six Indian nationals and an Indian fishing boat yesterday morning, Navy spokesman Lieutenant Commander Chaminda Walakuluge said.
SLNS Ranawickrama (Fast Gun Boat) on patrol attached to Kankesanthurai rounded up the suspicious boat.“The Navy became suspicious when they saw it was a ‘Dove’ boat. Usually, small ‘Dove’ boats are used by Indians. Our fishermen do not use these ‘Dove’ type boats. So we kept monitoring the boat,” Walakuluge said.
“It is also unusual for such a small boat to carry more than two people. There were six individuals in the small boat,” he explained.
“When the Navy searched the boat, we were able to find two large parcels of drugs, which are suspected to be heroin,” he added.
The apprehended drug parcels, boat and alleged Indian fishermen were brought to the Kankesanthurai harbour around six o’clock in the morning, the Navy spokesman said.
The suspects and drugs were handed over to Kankesanthurai Police for further investigations, he said.
Lieutenant Commander Walakuluge said in 2016, the Navy nabbed 130kg drugs including cocaine and heroin. He said the Navy has also seized 1,240 kg of Kerala ganja within the same period.
