Manidu wins double in Canada

Mandinu De Silva, a fifteen-year-old Sri Lankan born youngster trained by the Vancouver Lawn Tennis and Badminton Club in British Columbia, Canada shone at last weekend’s BC Junior Circuit tournament of the year, winning the U17 boys singles and doubles titles while becoming the runner-up in mixed doubles.
In one of his best performances to date, Mandinu won in straight sets in all his matches in both singles and doubles, defeating his second seed opponent in the singles final 21-9, 21-6 and winning his doubles final 21-17, 21-14. Mandinu and his partner claimed second place in a hard fought mixed doubles final, losing only by 19-21, 18-21.
Mandinu is the son of former National badminton players Thushan De Silva and Pubudu Wanigasekera who represented Sri Lanka in the 90s. He is currently being coached by Ram Nayyar, Head Coach for the Canadian National Badminton Team and by his father Thushan De Silva, Assistant Badminton Professional at the Vancouver Lawn Tennis and Badminton Club.
He is determined to continue training hard as he will be competing in the upcoming BC Junior Provincial Championships in April and the Yonex Junior & U23 Canadian National Championships in May.
