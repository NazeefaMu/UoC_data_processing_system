Govt. made AG a partner in political witch-hunt: Vasu

The government has made the Attorney General (AG) a partner in its political witch-hunt against opponents, Parliamentarian Vasudeva Nanayakkara alleged.
 He said the Constitutional Council has been reduced to the position of a rubber stamp of the government.
He was speaking at a press conference organised by the Joint Opposition at the Borella Dr N.M. Perera Memorial Centre yesterday.
Nanayakkara said the government’s political witch-hunt against opponents had gained alarming proportions today and said arrest and remanding of people should be done according to some established standard.
“Court action taken by the Attorney General’s Department without a proper standard has created a great problem as in the case of Udaya Gammanpila who has been taken in on charges of threatening witnesses residence in Australia. How could he threaten witnessed resident in Australia he asked. Inclusion of Ministers in the Constitutional Council had transformed it into a virtual rubber stamp of the government,” he alleged.
He said people appointed as members of various commissions were also people with allegiance to the government. He said the Constitutional Council concept seems to have been prostituted.
He said seniority had not been considered in appointing the Attorney General.
