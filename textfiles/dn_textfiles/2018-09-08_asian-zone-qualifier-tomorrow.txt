Associated Motorways, the sole agents for Suzuki Vehicles in Sri Lanka is partnering with the Ceylon Motor Sports Club, along with Sri Lanka Automobile Sport, to conduct an Auto Gymkhana, on September 9 with the aim of selecting two drivers to represent Sri Lanka at the FIA Asian Zone Auto Gymkhana Championship 2018.
The Asian Zone Championship will be conducted in Indonesia, India, Taiwan, Korea and Thailand and the organizer provides the cars to the competitors and in each country, a motorcar franchised agent partners with the organizer. In Sri Lanka, AMW and Suzuki are proud to partner with the CMSC and SLAS in facilitating the supply of the current best selling car in its range, the Brand New Japanese Suzuki WagonR Premium Hybrid which, was recently launched in Sri Lanka.
Gymkhana is an entry-level motor sport activity that the world governing body of Motorsport, the FIA, has developed, in order to bring new drivers into motor sport, without the limitation of a budget consideration. The Art of Gymkhana is a motorsport discipline that can be organized on a temporary track (e.g. car Park). The driver needs to drive between a set of cones adhering to a set route, in the shortest time possible. It is a competition against the clock, which is a test of the driver’s maneuverability and the route orientation, rather than pure performances of the car. The event will be restricted to drivers who have obtained a Novice License from SLAS, as this event is organized with the fundamental aim of choosing two drivers to represent Sri Lanka.
The Gymkhana will be held on September 9 at the Sri Lanka foundation mawatha (Car Park) from 8.30 am onwards.
