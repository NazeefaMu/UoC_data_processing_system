Docs threaten  to strike again

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) yesterday threatened to strike again starting today (Tuesday), if they do not not receive a positive response to a request to amend several clauses in the media release issued by the Government on Sunday which it says contain terms and conditions that the government will impose on the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM).
GMOA Secretary Haritha Aluthge yesterday said the government release included certain clauses which the GMOA had not agreed to and added that the Association was looking forward to a positive response from the government to its request to make the necessary amendments.
Speaking at a media briefing at the GMOA Headquarters yesterday, Aluthge said that President Maithripala Sirisena agreed to present a permanent solution to the issue related to the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) and that the GMOA has confidence in the President. The Secretary said that the trade union action on Saturday was suspended only due to receiving a positive response at the discussion held with President Maithripala Sirisena.
He further requested the President to appoint an efficient Health Minister and to extended the services of Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) President Prof. Carlo Fonseka so as to avoid creating a favourable situation for the present Health Minister to act according to his own will.
The Secretary also said that they would act on behalf of the aggrieved university students to obtain justice for them through an independent commission. GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr.Nalinda Herath said that the Government should not remand university students under false accusations of damaging the public property and the remanded students should be bailed out.
GMAO Spokesperson Dr.Samantha Ananda further said that there were certain politicians along with several members of civil society movements who block even the President and the Prime Minister in finding a permanent and sustainable solution to the SAITM issue.
