Udayanga Weeratunga's 16 bank accounts suspended

 
Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayarathne yesterday ordered the FCID to suspend the operation of 16 bank accounts belonging to former Sri Lankan Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga as part of investigations into the alleged MIA aircraft transaction. The magistrate made the order consequent to a request by the FCID.
On November 28, Magistrate Lanka Jayarathne permitted the FCID to peruse five bank accounts belonging to the former Ambassador to Russia.
The FCID yesterday again made a request to suspend those bank accounts.
