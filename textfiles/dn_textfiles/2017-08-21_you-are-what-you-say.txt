You Are What You Say

As always, last week too, after a two-hour visit I left the home of one of my former lecturers at Uni, who, without doubt is the best teacher I have ever known, with a mind full of useful tidbits and a million questions that awaited to be explored further. One question that kept bugging me came up when in our conversation my teacher said there are certain words that are never used these days, like invaluable. I gasped in horror. I had used that very word, in this very space in my article the previous week. When I blurted out, “But Miss, I use it all the time,” she looked at me for almost a second and said in a dramatic tone, “You are a fall back to your parents' generation!”
Could this really be true? Do I inadvertently use words I had picked up during my childhood, reading every single book on my father's bookshelves which were all published in the 60s and 70s or beyond? What kind of image do my readers have of me from the words I use in my articles? Can these very words that I am using now, reveal a lot about me?
Apparently, the answers are yes, yes, and yes. According to social psychologist James W. Pennebaker of the University of Texas at Austin, the way we write and speak can reveal volumes about our identity and character. After analyzing 400,000 texts—including essays by college students, instant messages between lovers, chat room discussions, and press conference transcripts—he concluded that words are important keys to someone’s psychological state.
Other studies too have found that people use language in different ways, and those differences are a function of their personality. The more frequently people use certain words, the more likely it is that they display certain personality traits.
For example, extroverts talk about fun-related stuff:music, party, and food. People with lower EQ (emotional intelligence) are more likely to use emotional and negative words: stress, depressed, angry, and unfortunate. Narcissists talk about themselves–the number of self-referential words (e.g., “I,” “me,” “mine,” “myself,” etc.) is indicative of someone’s self-love and entitlement. Artistic and intellectual individuals use highbrow words, such as narrative, rhetoric, and leitmotiv.
When asked if words really provide a “window to the soul”? Professor Pennebaker, said, when he began analyzing people’s writing and speech, he didn’t expect results like this. For instance, when he analyzed poems by writers who committed suicide versus poems by those who didn’t, he had thought he’d find more dark and negative content words in the suicides’ poetry. He didn’t—but he did discover significant differences in the frequency of words like “I.” Those who were depressed used it more often. In study after study, he kept finding the same thing. When he analyzed military transcripts, he could tell people’s relative ranks based on their speech patterns—and, it was the pronouns, articles, conjunctions, and other function words that made a difference, not the content words.
Explaining why function words are important he says, “People require social skills to use and understand function words, and they’re processed in the brain differently. They are the key to understanding relationships between speakers, objects, and other people. When we analyze people’s use of function words, we can get a sense of their emotional state and personality, and their age and social class.” Prof Pennebaker takes as an example the pronoun-heavy sentence: “I don’t think I buy it.”
When you use this sentence he says “You reveal a lot about yourself. Why did you say “I don’t think I buy it” instead of “I don’t buy it” or even “That’s ridiculous”? Pronouns tell us where people focus their attention. If someone uses the pronoun “I,” it’s a sign of self-focus. Say someone asks “What’s the weather outside?” You could answer “It’s hot” or “I think it’s hot.” The “I think” may seem insignificant, but it’s quite meaningful. It shows you’re more focused on yourself. Depressed people use the word “I” much more often than emotionally stable people. People who are lower in status use “I” much more frequently.”
Prof Pennebaker also says we can tell if someone is lying by their use of function words. “A person who’s lying tends to use “we” more or use sentences without a first-person pronoun at all. Instead of saying “I didn’t take your book,” a liar might say “That’s not the kind of thing that anyone with integrity would do.” People who are honest use exclusive words like “but” and “without” and negations such as “no,” “none,” and “never” much more frequently. We’ve analyzed transcripts of court testimony, and the differences in speech patterns are really clear,” explains the Professor.
It appears the words we use reveal our gender as well. “Most people think men use “I” more, because men are more narcissistic and self-congratulatory.” Says Prof Pennebaker, “But across studies and cultures, we found that women use “I,” “me,” and “mine” more. Women are more self-attentive and aware of their internal state. Men use more articles: “a,” “an,” and “the.” That means men talk about objects and things more. You use articles when you’re referring to concrete objects, because articles precede concrete nouns. Women also use more third-person pronouns—“he,” “she,” and “they”—because women talk more about people and relationships, and they’re better at managing them.”
In addition, a couple’s use of we-words when talking to a third party can convey a satisfying relationship. Laboratory studies reveal, when talking about marital disagreements, we-words indicated a good relationship whereas the use of you-words suggested problems. The use of you-words, such as you, your, and yourself, were most apparent in toxic conversations—usually where the two participants were accusing each other of various shortcomings.
Prof. Pennebaker also found that when the language style of two people matched, when they used pronouns, prepositions, articles and so forth in similar ways at similar rates, they were much more likely to end up on a date. This is not because similar people are attracted to each other, Prof. Pennebaker says; people can be very different. It's that when we are around people that we have a genuine interest in, our language subtly shifts. "When two people are paying close attention, they use language in the same way," he says. "And it's one of these things that humans do automatically. They aren't aware of it, but if you look closely at their language, count up their use of "I," and "the," and "and," you can see it. It's right there.”
Having read so much, I used an online service to analyze an old copy I had written for the Daily News, (I use 'so' way too much said the analysis) and came up with the following: “You are social, generous and imperturbable. You are cheerful,assertive, and respectful of authority. You consider both achieving success and taking pleasure in life to guide a large part of what you do. You seek out opportunities to improve yourself and demonstrate that you are a capable person. And you are highly motivated to enjoy life to its fullest.”
And I certainly hope that describes me!
So, the next time you write something or open your mouth to say something, remember, words matter.

Your Personality revealed through the words you write
* Powerful people don’t tend to say “I” very much; less powerful people do.
* Using “I” tends to increase people’s perception of your authenticity.
* If you use a lot of negative words or irony, you may be judged neurotic.
* Extroverts tend to use more positive words.
* If you talk a lot about achievements, you’ll be seen as conscientious.
* Using the word “we” creates an instant feeling of familiarity in your reader.
* Using “one” is very formal and distancing, so be careful of that.
* Likewise, your gender (and the gender of your readers) may dictate how you write. Women tend to talk more and tell more stories, whereas men like to get right to the point.
* Use simple words. If your readers have to reach for the dictionary, they probably won’t. And avoid jargon at all costs — remember that you are an expert in your field, but your readers probably aren’t.
* In addition, using complicated words to try to make yourself seem smarter… doesn't work
*Be aspirational. Your message should be something people want to hear (You can do it!) as opposed to something they don’t want to think about (It will be hard!).
