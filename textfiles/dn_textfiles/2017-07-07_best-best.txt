Best of the Best

MOVING pictures:
In this weekly series, we will focus on 200 greatest movies of all time, from the days of silence in the 1920s to the latest IMAX and Dolby Atmos blockbusters. Each week, we will feature two (or occasionally more) movies, one English (Hollywood, British, Australian) and one foreign language/World Cinema. Both live action and animated movies will be included. This is not a countdown list and there is no particular chronological order either. In other words, these are films that you MUST see before you die, in no particular order.
Almost every film reviewed here is available on DVD and/or Blu Ray, the latter being my preferred format due to the high definition picture and lossless surround sound. (A very small number of films are now available on 4K Ultra HD Blu Ray, which has four times the resolution of a normal Blu Ray). Yes, most of the films are also available online on Amazon Video and Netflix and occasionally even on YouTube, but online simply cannot beat the picture quality, extras and sound/subtitle options available on the physical formats. A description of the DVD or Blu Ray will be given in addition to the film itself and where possible, suggestions on similar films which may not necessarily make our list. Please also make sure that you watch the films through legally available methods. Piracy is a crime.
Today, we will begin with Vertigo and M, two of my favourite movies by two world famous directors – Alfred Hitchcock and Fritz Lang.
M (1931)
This B/W German movie starring Peter Lorre was Fritz Lang’s first sound film. It too was ahead of its time and its theme resonates with modern audiences really well. The story is riveting to say the least. A child murderer is on the loose in an unnamed German city. The police ask the public for assistance or tips. In the meantime, frustrated by the numerous raids the police have initiated in the city that have affected their business, the local crime bosses decide to take matters into their own hands.
They approach the city beggars’ organization with an offer - if they help him to capture the murderer, they would be richly rewarded. Soon, the murderer, Franz Beckert (Peter Lorre) is captured and brought in front of this mob. He begs his captors for mercy and asks that they turn him over to the police.
I am not going to reveal the rest - rest assured this is a great movie. After all, it is inspired by a real-life manhunt of a serial killer, Peter Kurten, in Dusseldorf. M is most effective in the manner in which it manipulates the audience’s expectations about good and evil, right and wrong, just and unjust. Lorre’s character is an ordinary man, soft-spoken and gentle. He looks like every other man on the street, yet he is a monster.
If you want to get this on blu ray, two options are available. The first one is a Criterion Collection edition and the other one is from UK-based Eureka Masters of Cinema. I have the latter, though I think extras wise the Criterion fares better.
The Criterion edition features an audio commentary by University of California at Berkeley professor Anton Kaes, author of the BFI Film Classics volume on M, and Harvard University professor of German Eric Rentschler, author of The Ministry of Illusion: Nazi Cinema and Its Afterlife, an English interview with Lang recorded in 1975, a History of M feature and the biggest surprise of all – the (unrestored) English version of M dubbed by the original German cast including Lorre.
You can also select the original French language track. On the Eureka MoC Series, there is a second audio commentary that features Martin Koerber, the supervisor of the 2001 film restoration of M and Peter Bogdanovich, director and author of Fritz Lang in America. Substantial excerpts from Bogdanovich’s original 1965 interview recordings with Fritz Lang are included. There is also a short documentary on Lang, who later migrated to the USA and made some very good movies in English.More on that in a later edition.
VERTIGO (1958)
This 1958 Alfred Hitchcock masterpiece starring Hitchcock’s favourite leading man James Stewart and Kim Novak (Vera Miles was the director’s first choice but she was not available) is now being recognized as the top movie of all time by many experts, displacing Orson Welles’ Citizen Kane. It is classic Hitchcock – Stewart is a detective who has a fear of heights (acrophobia or vertigo in common parlance) and one of his high-placed friends plots an elaborate scheme to get rid of his wife by using this knowledge to his advantage.
Suffice to say that Novak plays a double game (and a dual role) in this engrossing thriller. Unlike in many other Hitchcock movies, he gives the audience a major spoiler, which Stewart does not know. You must see this movie to fully unravel the ingenious plot.
Vertigo did not fare all too well when it was released. It was way ahead of its time, but today it is widely recognized as a masterpiece. Vertigo is known for its use of colour in different ways, from Saul Bass’ innovative titles to the dream scenes. Catch this one on Blu Ray – Universal’s restoration team did a marvellous job here and it looks as if it was shot last year, not 1958. I re-watched this BluRay last week and it simply blew me away.
The BD is stuffed with many extras including a sterling audio commentary by film director William Friedkin, though a previously available commentary by the restoration team has not made the cut. Among the other extras are Partners in Crime: Hitchcock’s Collaborations (55 minutes) which focuses on Hitch’s collaborations: “Saul Bass: Title Champ” (opening credits), “Edith Head: Dressing the Master’s Movies” (costumes), “Bernard Herrmann: Hitchcock’s Maestro” (music) and “Alma: The Master’s Muse” (Hitchcock’s partnership with his wife). Also look for Hitchcock and Truffaut Interview Excerptsfrom Francois Truffaut’s 1962 interview sessions with Hitchcock. Also, try to listen to Herrmann’s music using the DTS Master Audio lossless soundtrack. For similar movies, try Hitchcock’s own Dial M for Murder (available on 3DBluRay), Mulholland Drive (David Lynch, recently restored for a new Blu Ray under Lynch’s supervision), Obsession (Brian de Palma) and Basic Instinct (Paul Verhoeven).
