Judiciary is now impartial: Minister Samarasinghe

Unlike during the previous regime, the judiciary of the country is now impartial. It is so powerful and strong enough to take decisions even against the Executive President, Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said.
He added that the independence of the judiciary is evident when considering the Supreme Court’s decision on the President’s term.
He was addressing the media at the SLFP Headquarters, yesterday.
The Minister added that the judiciary has the freedom now unlike during the previous regime. The Minister recalled how former Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranaike was expel from her post during the previous regime as a result of giving a decision against the then government.
“The Supreme Court’s decision on the President’s term symbolizes that there is an independent judiciary in the country,” he noted. When asked whether the President wants to extend his term, he said the President is the only person in the history of the country who shed his executive powers through the 19th amendment. Then no person with a good mentality believes that the President wants to extend his term.
“Most of the powers of the Executive Presidency were removed through the 19th amendment to the Constitution. It was President Sirisena who implemented the 19th amendment. Is there any other person who is ready to shed the powers vested by the Constitution?” the Minister questioned.
He added that disciplinary action will be taken against SLFP parliamentarians who work against the party.
