Tree-planting ceremony  along coastline

North-western University students and the Coast Conservation and Coastal Resource Management Department launched a tree-planting campaign recently at the Sinnapaduwa coastline in Mundalama.
The project, organised under the title Surakimu Ape Werala (Let’s Protect Our Beach), was held to mark World Tourism Day.
This is the fourth such project conducted by the two parties.
Coast Conservation and Coastal Resource Management Department Development Officer Hemali Abeysinghe said that the campaign would help mitigate the damage caused to the coastline by fishermen.
