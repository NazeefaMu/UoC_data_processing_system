JO to request Speaker to grant Dinesh  Opposition leadership

The Joint Opposition (JO) has decided to hand over a letter to the Speaker next week requesting him to grant the Post of Opposition Leader to JO Leader Dinesh Gunawardena.
According to the Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna Chairman Prof. G L Peiris, the letter will be signed by 70 parliamentarians representing the JO.
Seventy out of 92 parliamentarians in the Opposition represent the JO, and they do not accept Parliamentarian R. Sampanthan as the Opposition Leader.
“Sampanthan is the only Opposition Leader in the world who do not criticise the government. He defended the Prime Minister when a No-confidence Motion was moved against the him,” he said.
