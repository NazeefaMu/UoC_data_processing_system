Case against former Lottery Board Chairman fixed for Nov.10

 
The Colombo Chief Magistrate today fixed November 10, to deliver its order regarding objections raised by former Development Lottery Board (DLB) Chairman Dr. Chandrawansa Pathiraja over the charge sheet filed against him for allegedly causing an unlawful loss sum of Rs.23 million to the DLB when awarding promotional activities pertaining to several lottery tickets to three private companies contrary to the accepted tender procedure.
When the cases came up before Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara, parties had filed their written submissions regarding the objections raised by defence over prosecution’s attempt to amend the charge sheets during the trial. 
The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption filed this case against former DLB chairman under Section 70 of the Bribery Act.
The Commission further alleged that the former Chairman had awarded promotional activities to the private companies between November 2014 and December 2014 in violation of the law. 
Counsel Niroshan Siriwardena appeared for the accused.
