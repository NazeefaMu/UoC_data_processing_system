Rotary presents ‘Outstanding Achiever’ award to Dr. Ajith Perera

The Outstanding Achievement Award of the Rotary District 3220 was presentedto Dr. Ajith C. S. Perera, at the annual Conference 2017 of the Rotary District 3220 in at the BMICH in Colombo.
Rtn. Barry Rassing - a trustee of the Rotary Foundation - representing the President of Rotary International Rtn. John F. Germ, was the Chief Guest at this event.
The award was made in recognition and appreciation of his contributions to bringing lasting change in the community, undeterred by his personal adversity, playing eight different roles voluntarily over 17 consecutive yearsto promote Accessibility Rights,focusing on enhancement of the quality of daily life of people of all abilities.
A large wayside tree crashed on Perera’s moving car in November 1992, leaving him instantaneously a paraplegic for life.
But he turned this misfortune into a crusade for the disadvantaged, to be an outstanding achiever serving humanity with lasting impact to his best ability.
He has contributed significantly to improving many unknown human lives, in keeping with “Rotary Serving Humanity”.
His successful challenge to the Government in the Supreme Court achieved a landmark order in April 2011 requiring access to buildings the public needs to use in daily life.
Last year, Sri Lanka ratified the International Human Rights Treaty of the United Nations (CRPD) to protect the rights and dignity of persons with restricted ability and ensure that they enjoy full equality under the law.
Implementation of the CRPD is also necessary for Sri Lanka to win back GSP Plus.
