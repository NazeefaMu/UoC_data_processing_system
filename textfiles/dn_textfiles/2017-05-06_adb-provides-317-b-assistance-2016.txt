ADB provides $31.7 b assistance in 2016

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has provided $31.7 billion in total assistance in 2016.
The ADB approved $17.5 billion in financing in 2016 from its own resources and attracted $13.9 billion in co-financing, both new highs. It also disbursed $12.48 billion, another record.
The institution also surpassed its target for public-private partnerships, supporting 58 transactions during the 2013-2016 period and outperforming the target of 50.
ADB has thus delivered its goal to increase development finance to the Asia and Pacific region, achieving most of its development and operational targets in the 4-year period 2013-16.
The 2016 Development Effectiveness Review (DEfR) was released in Yokohama,Japan at the 50th Annual Meeting of ADB’s Board of Governors. The report measures how well ADB is executing its corporate strategy, Strategy 2020, and the strategic priorities of the midterm review of the strategy across 91 results indicators.
“The ADB is delivering on its commitment to helping the Asia and Pacific region reduce poverty and achieve more inclusive and sustainable growth,” said the ADB’s Strategy and Policy Department Director General Indu Bhushan.
“The ADB will continue streamlining its operations so that it can deliver development solutions more quickly and effectively, while continuing to scale up finance for the region.”
The ADB met or surpassed 62% of the targets for development results and operational and organizational effectiveness. The report is the fourth and final report under the 2013-16 results framework.
Among the report’s main findings are that ADB’s climate change mitigation and energy projects, including renewable energy, achieved 100% of their intended outputs in 2016.
Nearly half of all ADB projects supported climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts.
During the 2013-16 period, ADB financed the building and upgrading of 34,000 kilometres (km) of roads and 1,400 km of railways, the installation of 13 gigawatts of new power generation capacity, a third being renewable, and grid connection of 692,000 households. New or improved water supply reached 3 million households, while 5.7 million people — 40% of whom are women—benefited from improved availability of financial services. More than 2 million teachers were trained. Nearly three quarters of projects achieved ADB’s targets for gender mainstreaming, a measure that assesses the extent to which projects integrate gender issues.
To address these challenges,the ADB is implementing a transitional results framework for 2017-2020 as the bank continues to prepare a new corporate results framework aligned with Strategy 2030 — ADB’s new long-term strategic plan which is currently being developed. The efforts are being made to boost project readiness, minimise delays, improve efficiency, and raise overall success rates through a second generation of procurement reforms. Steps are also being taken to raise women’s representation among international staff and optimize human resources for a stronger, better, and faster ADB.
ADB, based in Manila, is dedicated to reducing poverty in Asia and the Pacific through inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration. Established in 1966, ADB is celebrating 50 years of development partnership in the region. It is owned by 67 members 48 from the region.
