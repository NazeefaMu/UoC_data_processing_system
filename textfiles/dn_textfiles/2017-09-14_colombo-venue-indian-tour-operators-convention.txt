Colombo venue for Indian Tour Operators convention

In a major breakthrough for Sri Lanka Tourism, the first Indian Association of Tour Operators (IATO) Outbound Convention is to be held in Colombo from October 2-4.
IATO is India’s national apex body of tour operators with a membership of over 1,600 from across the country.
The membership consists of the nation’s inbound tour operators, travel agents, hotel chains, airlines, media and other stakeholders in the tourism and hospitality industries.
"The arrival of Indian tour operators for their convention next month in Colombo was important to Sri Lanka as it would mean more MICE events being attracted to the country," said Tourism Minister John Amaratunga. This is the first time that Sri Lanka Tourism has been able to attract the Indian Association of Tour Operators Outbound Convention and it once again proved that Sri Lanka is a well positioned MICE destination,” he said.
He said that Sri Lanka has hosted several events of this magnitude including the World Tourism Conference in Arugam Bay and Negombo.
He also said that hosting events of this nature would help to woo more Indian tourists to Sri Lanka.
This convention which is being handled by the Sri Lanka Convention Bureau (SLCB) is expected to have around 300 to 400 participants.
