Citizens  React To  Meethotamulla Tragedy

It was while Sri Lankans were indulging in ‘Avurudu’ that news of the disaster at Meethotamulla came. While at first there were little details of casualties, as news and images of bodies trapped under the mound of garbage emerged, people online became enraged. The government was duly blamed and the public remembered the other endless woes people living in Kolonnawa, where Meethotamulla is situated, had to undergo. Just last year, rains created rivulets of murky, filthy water that filtered into the homes of those living in the vicinity of the 91 metre tall garbage heap.
Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Harsha de Silva was one of many who took to Facebook to express condolences to the families that had lost loved one, trapped under the great mound of garbage. He said it was ironic, that just weeks ago agreements had been signed to begin a waste-to-energy project that would have ‘finally deal with this perennial problem.’ But Facebook and Twitter users were not easily appeased. Hitting out angrily at the Minister they reminded him the problem was ongoing for over 20 years – could not successive governments have found solution?
On Twitter, users shared feature articles written as far back as 2016, where in chilling prophecy, Meethotamulla residents said their ultimate death would be when the garbage dump collapsed on them. Others shared articles in which was published the shameful incident a local government politician had demanded money from an engineer who had volunteered to solve the problem. Others continued to hold the government responsible for the tragedies that befell its citizens. Memory of Salawa and Aranayaka were evoked where innocent citizens fell victim to tragedies caused by government mismanagement.
A majority was galvanised to action: Ordinary citizens and organisations set up Facebook pages requesting aid for Meethotamulla residents who were being evacuated from the area as Army personnel continued to dig for survivors. With the National Building Research Organization (NBRO) continuing to warn of impending danger, the residents of a further 130 homes within a 600 feet radius were evacuated from the site. Food, water, clothing, shelter; the public coordinated with police and local government officials on the ground to provide these basic needs, even as the Red Cross and the ‘Suvaseriya' stood by to rush the injured to the Colombo National Hospital.
The death toll from the Meethotamulla tragedy continues to climb, as more bodies are unearthed from the ground. While the government has declared no more garbage will be dumped at the Meethotamulla site and has offered to bear the expenses of funerals of those killed in the avalanche of garbage, people are eager to know what the government’s solution to Colombo’s waste problem is. Otara Gunawardene used Twitter to share her solution – exemplary, revolutionary waste management in Sweden, in which country less than one percent of household waste has been sent to a landfill since 2011.
