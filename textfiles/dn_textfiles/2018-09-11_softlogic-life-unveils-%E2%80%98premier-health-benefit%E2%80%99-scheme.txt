“The kind of life you seek is not going to just present itself. Just because you’re passionate about something and you have the necessary talents it doesn’t mean that opportunities and success will come easy. You need to pursue it, study it and live it. It is dedication and perseverance that makes the difference”, articulated Kumar Sangakkara.
He recognized Softlogic life’s commitment towards uplifting quality of life: “I’m proud to be representing Softlogic Life a brand that has made it their mission to enhance the quality of lives of Sri Lankans”.
