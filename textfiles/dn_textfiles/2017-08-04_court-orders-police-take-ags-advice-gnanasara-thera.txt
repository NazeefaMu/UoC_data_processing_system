Court orders police to take AG's advice on Gnanasara Thera

 
The Colombo Chief Magistrate's Court today ordered the Organized Crimes Preventive Division of the Police to obtain the Attorney General's advice regarding Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galaboda Atte Gnanasara Thera.
The charge relates to a complaint he had allegedly committed number of offences including obstruction of police from discharging their duties recently.
At a previous occasion, the Colombo Additional Magistrate Buddhika Sri Ragala reprimanded police for applying a lenient stance against Gnanasara Thera as they withdrew serious allegations that were mentioned in the first B report.
Further magisterial inquiry fixed for August 25.
Police had filed a B report against Gnanasara Thera on charges of obstructing police duties, threatening police officers, instilling disunity amongst the public and spewing hateful sentiments at Welikada recently.
President's Counsel Tirantha Walaliyadda with Counsel Sasika Mithunaarachchi appeared for Gnanasara Thera.
