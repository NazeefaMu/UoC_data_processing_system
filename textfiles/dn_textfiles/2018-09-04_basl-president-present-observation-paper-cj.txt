Law College incidents
BASL President to present observation paper to CJ

Bar Association of Sri Lanka president U.R. de Silva will present an observation paper to the Chief Justice today on the recent incidents that took place at the Sri Lanka Law College following allegations of election malpractice. He further said that his observation paper will be on the conduct of the Law Students Sinhala Union (LSSU) as he is the vice patron of the LSSU according to the constitution.
He added that Attorney at Law Shehan Perera, a lecturer at the Sri Lanka Law College will submit an observation paper to the Chief Justice on the conduct of the Law Students’ Union (LSU).
Silva noted that the final decision will be taken by the Council of Legal Education headed by the Chief Justice.
“One of the students at the college had voted for both parties while his name was not on the voters’ list. He was not objected by any of the polling agents when he casted his vote. He had first voted for LSU and then for LSSU. Only after he voted for both the parties, one of his batchmates had raised the issue. The parties objected to the conduct of the election stating it was unfair”, he said.
He noted that following the incident the administration had refused to cancel the election because of that single reason and had asked the student unions to report on other malpractices if there were any.
“According to the LSU’s Constitution, they had made their objection to the Principal, who is the patron of the union. The Principal appointed Attorney at Law Shehan Perera to conduct an inquiry over the incident.
He informed that the election cannot be cancelled based on one incident and that the administration would consider cancelling the election if more incidents were reported,”he said.
Silva further said that the unions objected to that decision as well.
“The following morning I was called to conduct an inquiry as the Vice Patron of the LSSU. When I visited the college, the students informed me that the polling agents were not present and I cannot conduct an inquiry. By then, the Principal was already held hostage. And they asked me to come at a different time, and when I went again they gave me the same answer and could not conduct the inquiry,” he explained.
He said when he went again on Sunday morning (2), the students blocked his path and had refused to let him in. The unions that agreed to an inquiry earlier had expressed their displeasure and said that they do not have faith in him. They had further mentioned that Silva had contested for the elections when he was in Law College and would be biased towards one party.
Silva refuting the allegations said that there were no parties back then and added that they all contested individually. However, with the support of the security officials he had entered the premises.
