Betel ‘chew’ up by Rs. 10

Betel sellers have decided to increase the price of a ‘chew’ by Rs. 10 due to the increase in production costs.
The price of a ‘chew’ of betel would increase to Rs. 40 from Rs. 30.
Betel sellers said that production costs have increased drastically and for years the price of ‘chew’ was not increased. They said that the wholesale price of areca nut is Rs, 4, while the wholesale price of a leaf of betel is Rs. 3.
