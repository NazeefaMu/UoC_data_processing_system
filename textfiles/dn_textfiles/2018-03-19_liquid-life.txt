LIQUID OF LIFE!

Water! We drink it, wash in it, cook with it, swim in it and generally take it for granted. This clear, tasteless and odourless liquid is so much part of our lives that we hardly ever think about its amazing properties but take it for granted. We would die in a few days without water as 65 percent of our bodies are composed of water.
Besides slaking our thirst, water is necessary to dissolve essential minerals and oxygen, flush our bodies of waste products, and transport nutrients around the body where needed. Water is the only substance that has these properties. And it has many more fascinating features that suggest that it has been designed ‘just right’ for life.
Water is not only the most essential substance next to oxygen for human life. It is also complex, often containing hundreds of dissolved minerals and chemicals. Most water is also ‘structured’ or clustered in complex ways. It is indeed a remarkable substance whose extreme value is often unrecognised.
And today, we are messing with it. The sheer number of human beings on Earth - seven billion, with another two billion likely by 2050 - is adding unsustainable stress to the supply and the quality of fresh water all over the globe. While water is life, the limited, and in too many cases, nonexistent, non-availability of clean, potable water means lingering sickness and even death for countless people in scores of countries.
Water, water everywhere, not a clean drop to drink! The old primer attributed to a ship-wrecked victim may become a terrifying reality if our precious liquid is not managed and sustained adequately. Who would have thought that there will be a day when sanitation of available water would be more of a concern than availability of water itself?
The availability of water decides not only the number of individuals of each species that are able to survive in a particular area, but it also decides the diversity of life there. Of course, the availability of water is not the only aspect that decides the sustainability of life in a region. Other factors such as the temperature and nature of soil also matter. But water is one of the major resources which determine life on land.
Many of us in urban Sri Lanka do not realise how fortunate we are. We simply turn on a tap when we need fresh clean water. We use this water for a variety of purposes. On average, our direct indoor water use comes to over 50 gallons of water per person per day. When you include all uses of water at home, both indoor and outdoor, a local family of four can use up to 200 gallons per day!
But spare a thought for the nearly 750 million people around the world who still have no access to clean drinking water. That is why so many people, children in particular, suffer all types of life threatening illnesses. In many parts of the undeveloped world women waste hours walking to fetch water from streams and waterholes rather than spending their time more productively.
It behoves us all to tell the world that responsible use of fresh water is essential for a healthy planet and human well-being. But fresh water, in turn, isn’t possible without a healthy planet.
Yet human actions are putting a healthy planet at risk. After all, life on earth is maintained by water. A crisis of fresh water has become the biggest challenge to humans in the millennium.
That is why all the world’s national authorities responsible for drinking water supplies keep stressing the importance of spreading the message that drinking water will be the most precious commodity in the world in the near future. Water means different things to each of us but one thing is for sure! It is vital for all our lives.
This is a problem that concerns us all. Water authorities everywhere are striving frantically to provide clean water, sanitation and hygiene to cover the world’s population by 2030. The goal is possible only if we all chip in and help them.
Fortunately, saving water around the house is easier today than ever before. Modern toilets, showers and faucets are designed to be more efficient and can save your household many gallons per day. For example, older toilets can use up to 6 gallons per flush, whereas newer low-flow (water-saving) toilets use from 1.6 to 3.5 gallons, and high-efficiency models even less.
Similarly, regular showerheads spray nearly a gallon per minute, while low-flow models put out just over half a gallon per minute. That is why we should also consider cutting our shower time down by at least a few minutes.
International World Water Day includes official and milestone events as well as many other events organized by various stakeholders around the world. Each year, the event highlights a specific aspect of freshwater. No matter how you spell it or how you pronounce it, H2O is a wonder: a beautifully simple, simply beautiful element that, when all is said and done, means nothing less than life. [email protected]
World Water Day, will be celebrated on Thursday March 22. It does so every year to focus attention on the importance of water. This year’s theme, ‘Nature for Water’, explores nature-based solutions (NBS) to the water challenges we face in the 21st century.
The campaign is called ‘The answer is in nature’ and raises awareness of NBS. The central message is that NBS, such as planting trees to replenish forests, reconnecting rivers to floodplains, and restoring wetlands, is a sustainable and cost-effective way to help rebalance the water cycle, mitigate the effects of climate change and improve human health and livelihoods.
By using NBS to help meet the water needs of a growing population, we will contribute to the creation of a circular economy, at the same time as helping to protect the natural environment and reduce pollution - both key targets in Sustainable Development Goal 6, which commits the world to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all by 2030.
Damaged ecosystems affect the quantity and quality of water available for human consumption. Today, 2.1 billion people live without safe drinking water at home; affecting their health, education and livelihoods.
Sustainable Development Goal 6 commits the world to ensuring that everyone has access to safe water by 2030, and includes targets on protecting the natural environment and reducing pollution.
The water crisis affects the poorest most – from slums to remote rural communities, refugee camps and disaster-prone communities, and particularly those marginalised by income, gender, caste, age or disability. As a result, the poorest live and die in conditions unthinkable to us in the developed world, unseen and unheard.
When we neglect our ecosystems, we make it harder to provide everyone with the water we need to survive and thrive.
