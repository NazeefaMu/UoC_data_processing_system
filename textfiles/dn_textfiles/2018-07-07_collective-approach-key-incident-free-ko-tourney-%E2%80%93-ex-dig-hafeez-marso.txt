Rugby won the day:
Collective approach, the key to incident free k/o tourney – Ex-DIG Hafeez Marso

Eight teams vied to clinch the Milo trophy knock-out schools’ ‘A’ Division rugby championship. At the finals worked out at Race Course Grounds last Saturday, St. Peter’s came back strongly in the second half to edge St. Joseph by 22 points to 20 points after trailing by 12 points at the breather. It was a battle between St. Peter’s forwards and St. Joseph backs; the driving maul made all the difference for the former to take the honours. The strategic move came after the short blast where the winners exploited on the weakness of the opponent and opted to keep the game close and tight with the forwards for the driving maul to do the trick and this seemed to be a right royal ploy. Congratulations - St. Peter’s for the splendid performance and to the loosing team, St. Joseph - a round of applause for the spirited display. The battle of the rugby “Saints”, turned to be an exciting second half with the traditional rivals trying to show superiority over the other.
As for this segment (KO) of the tournament, the good work done by the Sri Lanka Schools’ Rugby Football Association (SLSRFA), sponsors, teams and the team management, the officials and those who worked behind the scene are worthy of being mentioned; and most importantly, the behaviour of the spectators was impeccable. The whole tournament was conducted without any hiccup. Many of us may be keen to know what made things to change? Speaking exclusively to the Daily News Hafeez Marso - former DIG, Rugby legend, ex President of the Western Province Rugby Football Union and newly appointed Security Advisor to Schools Rugby by the Sports Minister revealed following, about how the just concluded ‘Milo’ inter schools rugby knock out tournament went without having a single incident of violence.
Interdependence
The purpose of writing this article is not to discuss about the matches but to critically analyse how misdeeds and immoral tendencies can creep into the game; the damage that can cause to the game; and how best those unscrupulous elements could be contained, avoided or eradicated for the game to continue and develop. Firstly, let us see how it was possible to conduct an incident free tournament? The answer to that question is very simple. It is all about the stakeholders playing their role working together in a process that could be termed as “Interdependence", a parlance that is naive to most of us.
There was better coordination and control that prevailed throughout the tournament precisely due to quarters and semis being played at one selected venue, the Sugathadasa Stadium under the close supervision of the SLSRFA and the finals staged at Race Course Grounds which obviously had a greater focus. As predicted, nothing untoward took place in the finals mainly because of the brotherhood that exist between the two traditional rival schools. This was the story behind the success of the knock out segment but similar conditions may not persist in a league tournaments due to the participation of large number of teams with the matches played at different locations, unless the authorities monitor the progress of the tournament and instinct discipline as they did towards the end of the league tournament this year. A clear vision towards a common objective can make a "sea change" for the future of rugby, a quest that is hard to come by, but not impossible.
Initiatives
It all started with the intervention of the Minister of Sports, Faizer Mustapha directing the SLSRFA to defuse the situation of unpleasant incidents taking place at schools matches followed by a comprehensive proposal. The proposed “Awareness Campaign" had a significant impact to take the message across, perhaps launched only at the end of the ‘Singer’ league tournament when the Milo trophy knock - out tournament was to begin in two weeks time. Kingswood College in their last match of the league distributed leaflets at the match venue denouncing violence to calm nerves; a great job indeed by the pioneers of school rugby in their small way; similarly some schools with the contacts of their old boys sought the assistance of the Police to maintain law and order as the host responsible for the security of the venue.
Yet again, the intervention of the Cinnamon Garden Police in arresting and producing to Courts, the spectator who is alleged to have assaulted a coach did sent the strongest message ever. Authorities should to be thankful to the Police for showing the path of zero tolerance. Having said that, it should be categorically reemphasise that physical security is not the solution to the issue in question. With such background in place, naturally a conducive atmosphere was created to stage the knock - out round; and adding more to this trend, the sponsors of the Milo trophy was spot on to drive a propaganda campaign themed “Respect the Game we Love” which gave further impetus to the message of zero tolerance via media, social media in particular, thus making the intentions very clear. In the process, more prominence was given by the sponsors to the upbringing of the sports than to its branding. The huge banner depicting the theme of the tournament displayed by the school children before the commencement of the finals was indeed impressive and this act alone may have probably contained the impulsive testosterone.
