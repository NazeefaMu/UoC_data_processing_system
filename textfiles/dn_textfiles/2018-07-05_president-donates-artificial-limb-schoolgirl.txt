President donates artificial limb to schoolgirl

President Maithripala Sirisena donated an artificial limb to N. G. Vinitha Damayanthi, who was born without a limb, fulfilling a request made by her to the President asking for assistance to obtain an artificial limb.
The donation was made at the Presidential Secretariat, on Tuesday.
She is a Grade 10 student of Siripura Central College. The student, who met President Sirisena during a programme in the Siripura area on December 31, 2017, requested the President to assist her to obtain an artificial limb.
The President instructed officials to take steps to produce a suitable artificial limb for her.
According to the request forwarded to Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake, the artificial limb was made in an artificial limb manufacturing unit established under the Directorate of Rehabilitation, where a Germen company has provided assistance by way of technical knowledge and materials.
Rs. 200,000 had been spent to make the artificial limb where aid was provided by the President’s Fund.
The girl lacks the proper placement of the bone in the shoulder. She has shown special talents in education. The parents of the child were thankful to the President for making her future brighter.
Director General of Sri Lanka Army Rehabilitation Centre Major General S. K. Thirunawukarasu was also present.
