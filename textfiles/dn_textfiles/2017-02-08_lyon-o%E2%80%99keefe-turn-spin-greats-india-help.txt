Lyon, O’Keefe turn to spin greats for India help

Sydney: Nathan Lyon and Steve O’Keefe have sought help from two of Test cricket’s greatest off-spinners ahead of Australia’s series in India later this month.
The front-line pair approached New Zealand’s Daniel Vettori and Australia’s chief destroyer in Sri Lanka last year, Rangana Herath, for advice ahead of the four-Test tour, which starts on February 23 in Pune. Between them, left-arm spinners Vettori and Herath have captured more than 700 Test wickets and boast outstanding performances in Asia.
“The main things you get away from those guys is challenging the batter’s defence,” O’Keefe told Cricket Australia’s website Tuesday from the team’s pre-tour training camp in Dubai.
“And if you can continually put the ball in the right area, given these conditions will spin more than what we’re used to at home, that will help us.
“It’s about building pressure and not being overawed.” he added.
“(India) are a class team, they’re exceptional batters at home and it’s going to be a big job.”
Following last month’s Sydney Test win against Pakistan, O’Keefe worked with former England international and fellow left-armer Monty Panesar at the National Cricket Centre in Brisbane. AFP
