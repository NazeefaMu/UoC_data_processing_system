Appreciations

Vasantha Obeysekera: Dedicated cinephile
Vasantha Obeysekera, who blazed a trail in the cine-field and breathed new life into Sinhala cinema, left us on April 8, breathing his last.
These are days of extravagant claims on promoting ethnic reconciliation. It warms the heart to ruminate upon the close bond of friendship which held us together despite our irreconcilable differences. This narrative is essentially to recapture glimpses of some poignant moments in our personal relationship and is not a critique on Vasantha’s film career.
Vasantha and I have been buddies for a period of five decades. We were together at Lake House. He was on the editorial staff of Sinhala/English dailies and I worked in the Editorial Administration Department.
I have had no particular penchant for cinema. For Vasantha, it was his passion. He had been a dedicated cinephile. As a fresher at his desk, no one paid any attention to his visual dreams. He could only share them with a pliant probationer like me—narrating a script, describing the artistic and dramatic aspects and yearning for the fulfilment of that vision.
Over a period, we had covered a wide range of topics of theatrical and artistic interest. We discussed Satyajit Ray, who had left a cinematic heritage and Lester James Peiris, the doyen of Sinhala cinema. We talked about Pandit Ravi Shankar, the exponent of sithar. We had probed the politics and mass appeal of screen icons in India and Sri Lanka—MGR to Sunil Dutt to Gamini Fonseka
Who is the wit who said, “a man who has not passed through the inferno of his passions has never overcome them.” It is true. Finally, opportunities nebulously opened up for Vasantha to “break through the blocks and win his inner creative battles” (per Steven Pressfield, in “The War of Art”)
In 1967, he found a slot on 'Sath Samudura' team to work with Film Director Prof. Siri Gurusinghe, as its co-Script Writer cum Assistant Director. After the 'Sath Samudura' stint, I saw Vasantha reading voraciously volumes of literatures on movie-making and techniques. In the meantime, in 1970, he directed 'Wes Gatho.' Through its debut, 'Wes Gatho' was well-received and reviewed by the press.
He got a break in 1971. With a view to honing his skills at a film institute in Paris, Vasantha left for France. I believe, he got a sponsorship through the courtesy of his brother Prof. Gananath Obeyesekere. We sat together and prepared his profile to be submitted in support of his application. Before leaving, to forestall potential tenant problems he wanted me to move into his house until his return, which I did. This was the tumultuous period of JVP insurrection (April-June) and, fortuitously, Vasantha was out of the country until late 1971.
After returning from France, he directed a couple of other films, 'Walmath Woowo,' 'Diyamanthi' and 'Palangatiyo.' 'Palangtiyo' was acclaimed by film critics and won plaudits. I kept abreast of Vasantha’s progress from his own feedback to me and also went through press reviews. The portfolio of his productions, over a dozen or so, included many award-winning films.
After July, 1983, I lost count of his films and I had, perforce, fled the country. At the time I became acquainted with him (1965), Lake House was a hive of political activities. Dudley Senanayake, leading the 'Hath Haula' coalition, had just assumed office and the Federal Party (FP), led by S.J.V. Chelvanayagam, was a constituent of the government. SLFP-led campaign, alleging Dudley’s secret pact with the FP and betrayal of the Sinhalese, had aroused passions.
Vasantha and I held sharply antagonistic views. I was a Federal Party activist and, in my perception, he was a Sinhala nationalist. He despised FP politics and Chelva was anathema to him. We had arguments over ethnic issues. Strangely, over the years, he had become mellowed and had drastically changed. He was close to President Chandrika Kumaratunga and had supported her peace initiatives. He condemned Sinhala chauvinism. If my recollection is correct, in pursuit of peace, he had joined other progressive artistes and academics and travelled to Vanni to meet with LTTE bigwigs. During my post-war visits to Vasantha, I have heard him castigating Mahinda’s triumphalism and tribalism.
At times of low spirits, Vasantha had brought me good tidings. I failed the B.A. (London) exam (External). After writing the exam again, in despair, I had given up on it and even forgotten about it. One evening, coming straight from Lake House, he excitedly rushed into my room and grabbed me in a bear hug, shouting “congratulations!” He handed me a printout from the teleprinter, which carried the pass list of successful B.A. candidates who sat the exam from Ceylon. My name was also there.
He was there again to share a buoyant moment with me; in October, 1976, when I took oaths as an Attorney-at-Law, my friends had a function at Wellawatte. My leader S.J.V. Chelva was there to bless me, together with several other MPs. There were Tamil, Sinhala and Muslim friends present. I was pleased to see Vasantha prominently seated among them with beaming smile.
I was forced to flee the country in the wake of the 1983 Black July anti-Tamil pogrom. Those were days of doom for the Tamils who were hunted down by the thousands, killed and maimed, their womenfolk violated, homes and businesses invaded, looted and set on fire by Sinhalese mobs, aided and abetted by men in uniform. It was a gloomy moment of grief to me. At that frantic moment, my friend Vasantha was the only person I could beseech to give me succour in Colombo and facilitate my flight out of the country.
A wee bit of digression and details may be warranted. The TULF political outfit, (of which the FP was a constituent) held its Annual Convention at Mannar on July 23 and 24 in1983. I was a TULF functionary and was away from Colombo for the Convention. Maybe, otherwise, I could not have been alive today to write this narrative. After concluding the first day sessions, TULF MPs (among them, only Sambanthan is alive today) and I were staying at Mannar Rest House. Close to midnight, we received calls from Jaffna informing about explosions and shootouts between the army and LTTE. Follow-up calls, in the early hours of the 24th told us that the army was running amok in Jaffna.
My abode in Colombo was a semi-detached house at 233/5 Cotta Road, Borella. Except for my next-door neighbours and a couple of others, who were Tamils or Muslims, residents in the neighbourhood were largely Sinhala families. My next-door neighbours had access to my residence telephone. I called them and found out that a Tamil bottle-dealer and some other residents close to our place had been killed. My neighbours were getting ready to move out to Kathiresan temple seeking safety. On their suggestion, I asked them to pick up a small bag from my cupboard, containing cash (Rs.2,000) and a passport, and to give it for safekeeping to Ajith’s family (Not the real name). Ajiths were nice Sinhala neighbours in the second house, who were friendly with me and also had, now and then, supplied midday meals to me. When I tried to contact my next door neighbours again, nobody picked up my line and I guessed they were gone.
From Mannar, steering clear of army camps and checkpoints, I reached Jaffna. At this time some SLAF aircrafts were providing commercial flights from Jaffna to Colombo-Ratmalana and I took a flight to Colombo. I knocked at Vasantha’s door at No.15 Lauries Road. I was in poor shape and he received me with a mirthless smile. Even as I explained my situation in few words, he shook his head in disgust. “I am sorry, Nava”, he said. I guessed that he felt awkward to see me in that condition.
Colombo was still in the grip of terror and tension. Vasantha thought it was not safe for me to visit my Cotta Road house to check on my stuff and, if possible, to retrieve them. Also, I had to collect my passport and cash from Ajiths, my neighbours. Vasantha took me by his moto guzzi to Borella Police Station, left me in the care of the OIC, and went alone to enquire about my stuff. He returned with a grim story—that the house was left wide open with doors and windows broken up and that no goods were there, except for piles of papers (from my clients files), partly burnt and scattered all over, rotting away in rain. Ajiths had returned only the passport. I didn’t say anything. I did not have a pair of shoes. Neither did I have another set of pants to change into. I did not have enough funds either. Vasantha sheltered me for two days at his house. He escorted me everywhere to buy shoes, obtain Indian visa etc. Finally, he took me and dropped me off at Katunayake airport. His parting shot was pungent: "Nava, I love you. But I hate your politics. I want to see you alive. Get out and get lost anywhere. Don’t ever come back to this wretched country."
I did, nevertheless, visit Sri Lanka for brief spells. In between, I have had the miserable life of a vagrant in different countries before Icould find a habitat in Canada.
I remained constantly in touch with Vasantha from abroad. During my several visits to Sri Lanka during the war, when I could not visit Jaffna to see my family and friends, I had stayed with him and gone out with him for meals.
Incidentally, I remember, in November, 2005, few days before the Presidential Election, Vasudeva Nanayakkara and Nimalka Fernando had joined Vasantha and me for a meal at a restaurant in Colombo. Vasudeva was rooting for Mahinda at that time.
He assured us that Mahinda was not a racist, but a human rights activist who had gone with him to Geneva to plead the case of the JVP victims. The revolutionary old guard had since become a protégé of Mahinda.
During my last visit to Sri Lanka in late 2015, I went looking for Vasantha at his Lauries Road residence. I was told that he had gone to stay with his daughter.
His daughter knows me. When I called her, she told me, “Uncle, he will be happy to see you; but, there is a problem.” Vasantha had a slip and fall accident and was on complete bed rest. He appeared to be in bad shape and the daughter requested me to “wait for some time.” I had to return to Canada and I regret that I could not make it. I miss you Vasantha. You have left behind an aching heart, but also happy memories. In my twilight years, I stay just a stone’s throw from your eternal abode. We may meet. Till then, Goodbye!

James and Victoria Jesubatham: Beloved parents
Late James and Victoria Jesubatham, my father and mother-in-law, who had given me so much of themselves, passed away on the March 22 and April 1, respectively at the ages of 87 and 82. They rested in peace with Jesus ten days apart, which signifies how unitedly they live closely together for 63 years.
Having losing their first born child Ranjith in 1955 after a brief illness, they brought up their son Raviand and three daughters, Romila, Rajeevo and Ramya, sacrificially, feeding them with higher education and all comforts in life and giving them in marriage to the right life partners. They have seen eight grandchildren and have looked into their welfare as well.Late James Jesubatham worked for A. Baur and Co. Ltd., Colombo, for 50 years, joining in 1947 as a clerical hand and retired as a senior accountant in 1997, which is admirable and a rare record in history books. Likewise, late Victoria Jesubatham started her career as a trained govt. teacher in 1960 and retired as a vice principal in 1990, at the same School; C.C. School in Pusellawa, serving for 30 long years. Their loyal dedication and respect for their jobs is praiseworthy.
They unitedly served and contributed a lot for the smooth run of the Church. Victoria was a senior member of the Holy Trinity Church, Pussellawa and served as an acolyte, assisting the parish priest, ordained by the former Bishop of Kurunegala. She also served as a warden and later, as the treasurer for nearly 12 years.
They helped the poor without exposing themselves as Christ preached and engaged in many social activities. Only in the funeral service orations lead by a Senior Priest, everyone got to know that they donated a very large sum of money towards the Kurunegala diocese to help the poor and needy. A part of that donation was to assist the clergies of the Kurunegala diocese; for their welfare after retirement. Up to now, many benefited by their generous deeds.They both had a special talents of counseling, not only to with family members, but also with teenage and elderly people who sought their help. They were very punctual and methodical in all their activities. They won the hearts of people, showing love and compassion immeasurably. I am proud of both of them as they stood for the right in every instance and maintained a high-quality of lifestyle without giving up each other under any circumstances.
We should console ourselves that they have gone to rest in peace with Jesus in heaven after toiling hard and running their meaningful race setting an example for the next generation. May the good God keep this precious souls in His bosom forever until we meet them in the gates in heaven.

Dr. Badiuddin Mahmud; Visionary leader
“.....Therefore, let me assure my Sinhalese countrymen that I am one with them in demanding complete freedom for our country.
They can count on me as one of the most ardent admirers of their legitimate national and cultural aspirations. In me and my community, let them know that they find the most trusted friends and kind neighbours in this island ...
Let me also assure my Sinhalese friends that the brave community to which I have the honour to belong, shall never consider any sacrifice too great, to make Lanka a happy, prosperous and glorious country in the world, where not one section of its population, but every son and daughter of her soil shall legitimately take pride in her glorious destiny...”
These inspiring words were spoken by an immaculately dressed young men who addressed an August assembly of the most distinguished leaders of the Muslim community who gathered on March 5, 1939, under the Chairmanship of Sir Mohammed Macan Markar to protest against the inadequate representation of Muslims in Legislative Council, consequent the recommendations of the Donoughmore Commission. The young man was none other than Dr. Badiuddin Mahmud.
With the demise of Dr. Badiuddin Mahmud on June 16, 1997, we have lost not only a great patriot, but also an illustrious national leader respected by all communities of Sri Lanka.
Dr. Mahmud was born in Matara, which was the cradle of some of the most illustrious sons of Ruhuna of the calibre of Cumaratunga Munidasa, the Sinhala poet; Anagarika Dharmapala, the Nationalist; Ven. Thotagamuwe Sri Rahula Thera, the gifted scholar and author of the famous, 'Salalihini Sandeseya' and the great scholar monk Prof. Valpola Rahula Thera. He received his early education at Matara St. Thomas’ College.
In 1938, addressing Prophet Muhammad's birthday celebrations at Galle, Dr. Mahmud created a sensation by urging Muslims to learn Sinhala.
He said, “If this is done, all misunderstandings will disappear and there will be perfect harmony between the Sinhalese and the Moors. Under self-government, which is bound to come sooner or later, the national language of Ceylon should be Sinhalese.”
As an educationist and efficient administrator, he immensely contributed towards the educational advancement of his community and it became a reality with the establishment of fully-fledged Gampola Zahira College.
He became the founder Principal under Dr. T.B. Jayah's management. Dr. Mahmud developed Zahira from the state of a dilapidated structure to its present stature, with up-to-date infrastructure facilities.
The contribution he made to Zahira College, Gampola, is an outstanding monument to his yeoman services to Muslim education and he has won him an honoured place in the educational history of the Muslim community.
From his college days at Colombo Zahira, through his University career at Aligarh in India, he has, throughout, shone as a revolutionary in politics, education, culture and in all important issues affecting the masses with whom he moved. In 1933, he was asked to leave Burma within 48 hours after his rousing and forceful speech urging the students to fight British imperialism with all strength and keep Burma for the Burmese.
Only a few are aware of the close friendship between late Premier S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike and Badiuddin Mahmud.
It was in 1925 that the young Mahmud invited late Premier S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike to address the students of Zahira College, Colombo. He saw, in Bandaranaike, the makings of the future leader of Sri Lanka, and from then on, his association with Bandaranaike became closer.
He became the first General Secretary of the SLFP under the leadership of Bandaranaike and it is well-known that the successful emergence of the party at the general election in 1956 owed a great deal to Dr. Badiuddin's untiring efforts and unflinching loyalty to the party and its leader.
When the government was formed in 1956, much to the disappointment of Bandaranaike, Badiuddin Mahmud declined to accept the offer of a nominated seat in Parliament and a Cabinet portfolio, because he thought, at the time, that by being outside the government, he could serve his community better. However, he served as a member of the National Planning Council and represented Sri Lanka four times at the United Nations and held the office of Vice-Chairman of its third committee in 1959.
After the SLFP victory in 1960, at the insistence of Late Sirimavo Bandaranaike, he accepted nomination to Parliament and was made the Minister of Education and Broadcasting.
As Minister of Education, his name will go down in the history as the man who gave significance to the principle of equality of opportunity in education for all by taking over the assisted schools in the teeth of opposition by vested interests.
Dr. Mahmud re-organized the schools and the system of education to suit our national needs. He courageously brought out sweeping changes in education like the introduction of technical education to rural schools and gave them science laboratories and workshops.
He appointed the National Education Commission and the Technical Education Commission and laid the foundation of a truly national system of education. For the services he rendered to the country in the field of education, he was conferred the Doctorate of Literature by the then Vidyodaya University and Doctorate of Laws by the Vidyalankara University.
Subsequently, as Minister of Health and Housing, he took a major step in them in the interest of the common people by abolishing private practice and the introduction of the channelled system, despite opposition from the influential quarters.
Dr. Mahmud adopted many drastic measures to improve the health facilities in the urban and rural areas and also improved the facilities for Ayurvedic Researches.
Dr. Mahmud was a true national leader who always associated with the Sinhalese people in the struggle for independence.
He was not only an admirer of the Sinhalese people and their history, but also fully shared with them, their aspirations for a united Sri Lanka without divisions of any kind, be they communal, territorial, political or religious.

Dr. Michael Joachim: Down-to-earth engineer
It was sad, the passing away of old Benedictine Dr. Michael Joachim, an engineer, after a brief illness. He was fun and bonhomie till the end and was his usual jovial self till death struck cruelly and silently to take away from this world, a great and sincere friend, benefactor and above all, a down to earth man, although he could have flaunted his plumes, considering his doctorate and engineering skills and being the son of another old Ben and doctor A.W.R. Joachim the first Ceylonese doctor of Agriculture.
Dr. Michael was the Chairman of the CIDA with many more years to serve the country and his profession when sudden death struck like a thief in the night. He was in great demand during the Presidency of the late Ranasinghe Premadasa and was one of pioneering architects of the late President’s ‘Gam Udawa’ concept. Another of Michael’s foresight and construction was the Fish Market in Pettah which has been unfortunately demolished and where now stands the Gold Centre. President Premadasa’s son Sajith, who followed his father’s every step, realized the potential and appointed him Chairman of the State Engineering Corporation and then CIDA where he served with excellency and honesty. Sajith will certainly miss him.
Hailing from an illustrious family, he was the son of former old Ben late Dr. A.W.R. Joachim, who was the first Ceylonese Director of Agriculture. After a brilliant career as a student at St. Benedict’s College, Kotahena, where he excelled in studies, carrying away many prizes in his pitch of study, he also showed his prowess in sports, being a good tennis player and a big-hitting, fast-bowling all rounder and a top sprinter in the late 1950s. He also took part in the Public Schools Athletic Meet, which was the showcase of schools athletics at that time.
In cricket, his teammates were Lionel Fernando, Elmo Rodrigopulle, Allan Gunesekera, Nihal Amerasinghe, Quintus Perera, Cyri Ernest, Ranjit Perumal, to name a few and in tennis, Lasantha Fernando and Cyril Ernest. In athletics he ran in the feared company of Kenneth Dabrera and others.
Dr. Michael was a proud boarder at SBC and was a sincere and dear friend of mine because I too, was a boarder. Many were the wonderful moments we spent in each other’s company, discussing studies, sports and above all, he was sincere in discussing what he could do for his school and country. Simple and unassuming as he was, everyone, to him, was a friend. He would go out of his way to help a fellow student or his team mates in tennis and cricket and he was a true friend indeed.
He would be present at every function of the college and always took time off his many onerous duties to proffer advice, guidance and support for college activities and was a founder of the college development fund.
Dr. Michael would walk with kings, but would be always be down-to-earth and he could have had the best of five-star hotel food, but he would always tell me that the best meal he enjoyed was in a 'bath kade' or a hopper market. Such was his simplicity. I can vouch for this because there were many times I kept his company in one these markets.
In addition to his excellence in studies, he was handsome and there were many girls at the adjoining Good Shepherd Convent who would give him glad eyes. But he reserved his dying and eternal love to a beauty Estelle Joseph and what a grand and enviable couple they made.
Michael and Estelle had a daughter Janice and son David. He was given a grand burial by his numerous school mates and religious dignitaries who were present in their numbers in respect and admiration for what he did for his school and its progress and development.
Goodbye my dear friend, till we meet on that beautiful shore.
