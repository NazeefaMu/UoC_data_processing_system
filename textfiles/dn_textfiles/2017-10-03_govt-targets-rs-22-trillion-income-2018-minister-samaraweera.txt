Govt targets Rs. 2.2 trillion income in 2018: Minister Samaraweera

The government targets an income of Rs. 2.2 trillion in 2018, Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
The Minister was addressing the national ceremony to mark World Habitat Day in Matara yesterday.
He said the value of loan installment to be paid for the financial year is around Rs. 1.7 trillion. Over 84 percent of such loans have been obtained by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as then Finance Minister, he said.
The minister said the former government went for a snap election as they were aware that they would have to face the crisis soon.
“The former government declared a snap Presidential Election not because of the predications made by an astrologer, but because of an imminent crisis in the economy due to the debt burden,” he said.
Minister Samaraweera said certain individuals were of the view that the government was on the verge of collapse, when a Minister tendered his resignation to prove his innocence.
He said no person in the world other than a Buddhist who can implement the ideals of reconciliation.
“From our childhood, we were trained to meditate wishing people of all communities wellness, happiness and kindness,” he said.
