Women’s awards in Toronto to open biz opportunities for Lankans

The hosting of the historic Sri Lanka, Women in Management’s Top 50 Women’s Awards ceremony next year in Toronto will open out untapped business opportunities in both countries said, Rienzie Martinez coordinator of the event in Canada.
Martinez who is also the President of CANITS independent consultants, in Toronto Canada said that there are several Sri Lankan born business women who will get the opportunity to not only be recognized by being awarded but also get much needed exposure in both Canada and Sri Lanka.
He said that the event is a historic one since it’s the first time that a Sri Lankan a organization is hosting a event of this magnitude overseas.
The event titled Professional & Career Women Awards 2017 – First Edition Canada would be exclusively for Sri Lankan women based in Canada. “The awards aim to give the next generation role models that show it is possible to have a sense of status, achievement and success by conducting oneself in a manner that is inspirational.”
The objective of the event is to honour and pay tribute to recognizing Sri Lankan women who have excelled in their careers, professions and businesses in Canada; and thereby pave the way to further promoting their businesses and practices amongst all Canadian Sri Lankans and other communities.
He said that the event will also see several Sri Lanka successful women entrepreneurs who won awards at the Colombo event participating and this would give an opportunity for both parties to interact and find new markets and even joint ventures.
WIM Chairperson Sega Nagendra said that the nominee should be of Sri Lankan origin and the business should be in operation in Canada for at least 36 months. Nominations will open from September 4, 2017 and end on November 25, 2017.
