HelpAge trains elder care assistants

Over 100 males and females, residents of Baddegama, Mawanella and Killinochchi Divisional Secretariats recently participated in training courses as Elder Care Assistants under a special programme, conducted by HelpAge Sri Lanka (HASL) in collaboration with the Prime Minister's office.
The Vocational Training Authority (VTA) and the National Apprentice and Industrial Training Authority (NAITA) also assisted the 150 day training programme.
Accordingly, all trained personnel received the internationally recognised `National Vocational Qualification Level 2' (NVQ Level 2) certificate which helps them to work as Elder Care Assistants to needy elders in Sri Lankan households and in elder's homes.
In addition, trained personnel with advanced training and experience could also seek employment abroad, especially in Western countries where a large number of vacancies are available for Sri Lankan care workers.
During the in-house training period, the trainees received a theoretical training (class room training) and also a practical training where they were trained to assist elders in their day to day activities.
The trainees also received knowledge on methods of maintaining hygiene and cleanliness of the household environment of the elders.
HelpAge Sri Lanka Executive Director Samantha Liyanawaduge said this was a novel employment generation programme to our country and this special elder care assistance training was given to any interested person between the age group of 18-55 free of charge by HelpAge.
Executive Director Liyanawaduge also thanked the officials of nursing homes, private and public hospitals and elders' homes for extending their unstinted support to carry out the programme during training sessions, conducted in their respective institutions.
Prime Minister's office Vocational and Technical Training Committee Deputy Chairman Asitha Talwatte said the elder care assistant programme helped a large number of persons to obtain employment with higher monthly emoluments.
Prime Minister's Office, Policy Development officer Dr. Nandaka Molagoda urged HelpAge to conduct such elder care training programmes in all districts, especially in rural areas as this programme could be regarded as a part of the creation of the Government's one million employment providing programme.
HelpAge, Home Care Division, Manager Janaka Seneviratna said such programmes will be conducted in future and thanked the Vocational Training Authority and the National Apprenticeship and Industrial Training Authority (NAITA) for assisting in the programme.
