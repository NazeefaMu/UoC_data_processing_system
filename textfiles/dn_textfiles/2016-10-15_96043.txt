Sri Lanka ‘A’ lose, but match serves its purpose

Sri Lanka ‘A’ may have lost the second unofficial test to West Indies ‘A’ badly by a massive margin of 333 runs at Pallekele yesterday, but the result didn’t matter so much because the national selectors were experimenting with a few players before they selected the squad to Zimbabwe.
Sri Lanka are due to make a two-Test tour to Zimbabwe later this month and also play a one-day tri-series with Zimbabwe and West Indies. The national selectors were making use of the series to pick the squad to Zimbabwe and were not too concerned with the result. The pitches prepared for the series were grassy and had bounce on it.
“There was more bounce and pace at Pallekele than at R Premadasa and wewere not upto it,” said Sri Lanka A team coach Avishka Gunawardene. Although the pitch was quick the ball came nicely onto the bat and our batters missed out on a good opportunity to put some useful runs on the board.”
Leg-spinner Jeffrey Vandersay a last minute inclusion into the side had a poor game with figures of 1 for 110 and 1 for 80.
“Jeffrey was returning to competitive cricket after about six months and his performance clearly showed that he was short of match practice,” said Gunawardene. Vandersay broke the middle finger of his bowling hand during practice and was out of action since May.
However Gunawardene said that the two matches in the series so far also had its positives.
“Dimuth (Karunaratne) made use of the series to get his form back and Lakshan Sandakan also impressed in the first match,” said Gunawardene, a former opening bat.
Karunaratne scored a century in the first ‘test’ and followed it up with an innings of 68 at Pallekele.
Sandakan who was down to play at Pallekele was in the eleventh hour stood down and Vandersay included as the selectors wanted to have a look at him.
Gunwardene said the other change made to the team was the inclusion of Avishka Fernando for the injured Kusal Perera (hamstring).
West Indies A leveled the three-match unofficial test series 1-all with their win at Pallekele yesterday.
Sri Lanka A set a target of 481 runs folded up rather tamely for 147 to hand out to West Indies A victory on a platter.
Resuming at 36-2 Sri Lanka A were dismissed 34 minutes after lunch on the final day with none of the top order batsmen making any kind of contribution.
They were down to 77-7 before some stout-hearted batting by the late order got them to their final total.
Sri Lanka under 19 captain Charith Asalanka contributed 34 and Jeffrey Vandersay picked for his right-arm leg-spin bowling top scored with a plucky 47 off 70 balls inclusive of six fours and three sixes – his highest score in first-class cricket.
West Indies A came up with an all-round bowling performance with all five bowlers used by skipper Shamarh Brooks picking up a wicket or two. Their key bowler was off spinner Rahkeem Cornwall who made use of the spate of left-handers in the Sri Lanka A team to capture eight wickets in the match.
“We were clearly outplayed in all three departments,” said Gunawardene. “They took all the half chances that came their way whereas we made a crucial miss when (Jahmar) Hamilton was dropped off the third ball and he went on to score 99 out of a partnership of 188 with Vishaul Singh which took the game away from us.”
West Indies A invited to bat first piled up a massive 509-9 declared based largely on that partnership.
“It was a game where everything went wrong for us and right for them,” said Gunawardene. “For instance yesterday Roshen Silva was unfortunate to be run out at the non-striker’s end when the ball richoted onto the stumps off the bowler’s hand. Losing certainly hurts but I am sure we will bounce back in the next match.” It was a good comeback by West Indies A after losing the first unofficial test to Sri Lanka A by seven wickets at the R Premadasa Stadium.
The third and final unofficial test starts at Dambulla on October 18.
