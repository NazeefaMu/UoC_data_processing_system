Vibrant hues

The Kingsbury high tea monthly fashion show featuring a vibrant collection by ‘K Lee’ was held on July 27 at The Gourmet Station. The collection featured some trendy designs by the young designer. The event received a good turn out as the high tea buffet at The Kingsbury delivered great flavours and variety.
