RIU successfully winds up Real Estate Roadshow in London for 2018

The Research Intelligence Unit (RIU) has successfully concluded its autumn Real Estate Roadshow in the United Kingdom, generating strong interest from potential investors, both of Sri Lankan origin as well as UK based entities and fund managers.
It was held at the Arab British Chamber of Commerce in Mayfair and this was RIU’s second UK event for the year. It follows the successful Investor Forum conducted in May at the Sri Lankan High Commission in London. The initiative is part of RIU’s strategy to promote Sri Lanka’s real estate and investment opportunities globally and to provide clear and reliable information for investors looking to invest in Sri Lankan real estate.
The autumn road show kicked-off on 6 October with the sponsorship of a dinner dance organised by the Old Thomians Association of UK at One Great Street, Westminster. The event included a Champagne Reception, followed by dinner and live music. A large number of high net-worth individuals of Sri Lankan origin expats attended.
On October 10, the 11th Annual International Real Estate Finance Forum (IREF) was held at the Arab British Chamber of Commerce (ABCC). A special message from the Minister of Public Enterprises, Lakshman Kiriella, was read out with a view to instilling confidence amongst the participants. The event was a full day of discourse and discussion with the participation of interested investors and leading personalities such as Robin Griffiths (ECU), Mohamed Tariq (IDB), David Testa (DDCAP) and Paul Tostevin (Savills). The Forum was followed by the IREF Emerging Markets Awards and dinner.
The IREF was immediately followed by a series of EXPO evenings on 11, 12 and 13 October. The RIU Sri Lankan Property Exhibition at ABCC focused strongly on generating sales for Sri Lankan developers by connecting them to the diaspora HNIs and London based property investors.
The final stop on the roadshow was at the Long Room, Lord’s Cricket Ground, London. Organised by the Executive Committee of the British Sri Lankan Association, the annual flagship event of the association was an opportunity to celebrate the successes achieved by the British Sri Lankan community.
Royalty graced the occasion along with a large number of diplomats, sports personalities, investors, investment companies and other groups of professionals.
Founding Director and CEO of RIU, Roshan Madawela, said, “Tour presented a unique opportunity for real estate professionals from Sri Lanka to position the investment opportunities on the Island to not only the diaspora community but to a much broader audience, effectively placing Sri Lanka on the map as a viable emerging market for London based investors”.
Moreover, he said that the week-long series of events facilitated almost 1,000 face-to-face meeting opportunities as well as other benefits like brand promotion which will have a long term benefit to the developers.
Leading developers who took part in the roadshow included Shangri-La, Altair, Dustin Thani, Blue Ocean, Capital Trust, Global Housing, H & H Golding and White House.
