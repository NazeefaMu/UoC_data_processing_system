Lankan flavour in Beirut

The Sri Lankan Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon displayed Sri Lanka’s cultural heritage to over 3,000 participants at the Abey Heritage Festival held at the Institute of Technology of the Lebanese University in Abey, Lebanon, recently.
The Abey Heritage Association hosts an event annually displaying the heritage of different countries.
The Sri Lankan Embassy in Beirut participated in the Fair to promote Sri Lankan tourism and tea, and exhibited traditional crafts. A wide variety of ‘Ceylon Tea’ was served and tourist information was provided to enquiring and enthusiastic visitors to make them conversant of Sri Lanka and to motivate them to visit Sri Lanka.
