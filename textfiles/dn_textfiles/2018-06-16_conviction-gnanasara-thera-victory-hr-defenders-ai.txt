Conviction of Gnanasara Thera is victory for HR defenders-AI

The conviction of a monk who had threatened Sandhya Eknaligoda, a well-known campaigner against enforced disappearances, is a victory for human rights defenders in Sri Lanka, Amnesty International (AI) said on Thursday
A Magistrate’s Court in Homagama sentenced a six months prison term and a heavy fine to Galagodatte Gnanasara Thera for threatening Sandhya Eknaligoda in Court when she appeared in 2016 to seek justice for the enforced disappearance of her husband, Sri Lankan cartoonist Prageeth Eknaligoda.
“This is an important verdict for all people who fight for human rights in Sri Lanka. A clear message has gone out to those who seek to intimidate, threaten and silence people seeking justice,” AI Deputy Director for South Asia Omar Waraich said.
