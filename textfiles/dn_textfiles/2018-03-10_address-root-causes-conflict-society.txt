Address root causes of conflict in society

Kandy is reportedly calming down. The violence that was seen in many areas, especially Digana, Teldeniya and Katugastota has been largely curbed. The efforts to restore complete peace in the region, and understanding between the Sinhala and Muslim populations will need much more concerted action by the leaders of the communities and government. It will require strong efforts to prevent this crisis moving to further areas of communal unrest and confrontations that cannot be the goal of the Sri Lankan people.
In the field of governance, Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara, current Minister of Public Administration and Management, is sworn-in as the Minister of Law and Order, the portfolio temporarily held by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe since the recent half shuffle of the Cabinet. It removes Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka from the running for this office, despite much effort by the UNP; and many objections by the Joint Opposition (JO) and the SLFP group within the government to a possible Fonseka appointment.
Minister Madduma Bandara (UNP) certainly takes over a huge burden both in politics and governance. A Member of Parliament from the Monaragala District since 1989, he was Chairman of the District Development Council from 1981 to 1988, and a Minister of the Uva Provincial Council, too. He takes up this office when the very issue of Law and Order, especially the lack of it, has been pointed out by many as the cause for the recent crisis that took place in Kandy, as well as the earlier situation in Ampara. The communal violence in Kandy is the matter of urgency, with the necessity to prevent it from spreading into a wider and dangerous communal conflict, the like of which is not strange in Sri Lanka, in recent decades.
There is also the need to act with speed and purpose in seriously pursuing the charges of fraud and corruption among the leading members of the Rajapaksa Regime, which was the pledge to the people that saw the election of the current Yahapalanaya coalition of National Unity. It is no secret that the opposition to appoint Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka to this office by the JO and the SLFP (and SLPP) was largely due to fears as to the possibility of his acting with a strong commitment against these forces of corruption. Both Justice, Law and Order have been with the UNP since August 2015, and the long record of delays and inaction with regard to the corruption of the last regime, has been a strong negative on the government. It has also raised criticism from President Sirisena on more than one occasion. It certainly contributed to the defeat suffered by both the SLFP-UPFA and UNP in the recent local government poll. Therefore, Minister Madduma Bandara certainly has a major task in his performance, in the context both the communal tensions arising from Ampara and Kandy, and the delay in the government’s promised fight against corruption.
Ampara and Kandy
The Police now reports that the main suspects in the instigation of violence and pursuit of communal disharmony in the major disturbances in Kandy have been arrested, along with nine others. Until 6 a.m. on Thursday (8th) a further 71 individuals have been arrested by various police stations in the Kandy district in relation to criminal incidents that occurred from the night of March 4, leading to 81 suspects being in custody over the violent incidents in Kandy.
These reports are encouraging, but the question certainly arises as to the cause of the delay in suitable and necessary action being taken to prevent the large scale violence that did take place, and laid the groundwork for a much larger communal confrontation, largely brought under control with the deployment of the military.
This situation requires looking at what took place at Ampara just a week earlier, where too there were serious criticisms of inaction by the Police, and other state institutions. It did see an attack on a Mosque and on property of Muslim citizens. The violence arose over a wholly false claim of ‘sterilization’ tablets being served in rice sold in a Muslim owned eatery. Such talk has been spreading for some time in this county. There are many who warn the majority Sinhala Buddhists of this danger to the majority community being reduced to a minority by these means.
The government authorities, especially those responsible for ensuring communal harmony, have not taken adequate educational steps to expose this deadly and sinister publicity move. In fact, it was several days after the Ampara violence that the Director of Health Services made a statement that such medicine for male sterility does not exist in the world. It is a fact that could have been given publicity and brought to the knowledge of the wider public, with proper use of the media – both regular and social, and steps taken to prevent manipulation by the forces of communal rivalry and violence, through better social knowledge – among both the clergy and laity.
The situation that led to the violence and aroused communal hatred in Kandy is of a different nature, and in fact was not from any situation of communal violence. It was the result of a motor accident involving lorry driven by a Sinhala person, and others in a three-wheeler. The lorry driver was badly beaten in this assault, and admitted to hospital, on February 20, where he spent several days in the ICU before his death on March 3. There was no evidence of racial enmity in this confrontation.
The alleged assaulters from the three-wheeler were arrested by the Police. But the situation was to change very fast after the driver’s death. It is now known that the leader of the Bodu Bala Sena, Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera visited the funeral house, a few hours before the first attacks in Getambe had taken place. The Police did intervene and make several arrests. But there was an overall neglect of official government action to prevent any further violence.
The next morning there had been a mob near the Police Station demanding the release of the suspects, and the Bodu Bala Sena leader and another monk had also been here. There had also been statements about contacting a DIG who would support their demand. This showed a dangerous twist on to communalism, which required quick and determined action by the authorities, but which did not come in time.
The situation that followed is what Kandy and the country faces today. It is one of Ethno-religious hatred that is showing its continued position in the country through all the years of independence.
We have had many years of ethno-religious peace, but hardly any of real understanding. The hatred remains below the surface, ready to come out with violence depending on the support from ethnic or religious extremist forces, and governments that find this suitable for the consolidation of power.
The widow of the driver who was killed in the Getambe post-accident attack, Lalitha Pushpakumari (41) said that fighting can’t bring back the life of her husband. “There is no point in fighting and claiming more precious lives of the people, and making more widows like me. My husband was so innocent and everyone in the village adored him”. She is now helpless with a disabled son, a daughter, his mother and herself. What is the future for her family? (Daily Mirror – Feb. 07, 2018). This is a very Buddhist statement, which is certainly not the thinking of the Sinhala Buddhist majoritarian extremists, who certainly stoked the fires that has burned parts of Kandy, and continues to pose a future threat to Sri Lankan society.
Coming after all the Ethno-religious violence on Black July in 1983, and all that followed in the years of LTTE terrorism, this shows the need for responsible forces and institutions of government to take all necessary action to prevent the spread of ethno-religious hatred that can, and will, lead to violence, posing major threats to the unity of Sri Lankan society.
This also calls for rethinking the policies of political parties and organisations of civil society that can influence the proper progress of society. One has to look at the economic and social backwardness of the country, and how this affects the Ethno-religious relations in the country, and how much the constitutional guarantee of the highest place to Buddhism, has helped to promote Buddhist thinking in society, as against the thinking of majoritarian power in every context.
The situation in Kandy and Ampara certainly makes it necessary to look back at what happened in Aluthgama in July 2014, and the forces that led to that major ethno-religious clash and certainly played their part in the tragedies of today. This calls for rethinking of politics to address the needs of the people, without exposing them to the forces of division, and building a majority with an understanding and belief in the rights of all humans. It is a need to address the root causes of ethno-religious conflict, and not evade them.
