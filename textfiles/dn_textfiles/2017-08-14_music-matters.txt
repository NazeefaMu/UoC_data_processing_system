It will foster and develop indigenous art and culture, promote international art and culture among Lankans and nurture local artists to reach international standards,” he said.
“This event will not only be a center of entertainment and competitions, but will also provide the platform for multi-cultural exchange, especially for our youth,” Chanmugam added.
The festival will feature three competitions each of which will have ten categories to compete under. Choirs from all over the Asia Pacific region regardless of their present achievements will be able to participate at the Open Competition while the choirs with international experience will be able to take part in Asia Pacific Champions Competition. All competitions will be judged by a panel of international jurors who are experts in music and choral singing.
In addition to competitions, choirs will have the opportunity to participate in Friendship Concerts, workshops and master classes to promote art and culture among students.
