Yalpanam yum- yum

Aroma is the first hint. Then the music fills your ears. The traditional dance performance surfaces next. The guests enamoured by that kind of cultural extravaganza while savouring the aromatic cuisine will be tempting enough. Music, dance or food; which one is worth a first try? Move heaven and earth, yet you will still be clueless. Lay that worry to rest and feast the night away for the Jaffna Festival is now in city.
Jaffna, more affectionately known as Yalpanam, has triggered many stories in Sri Lanka. Jaffna library, Yal Devi train and the list will go on. Hardly anyone would however talk about delicacies from this far off metropolis apparently because of a war that ran for decades.
Thanks to the efforts of a few culinary experts, the Colombo citizens now have an opportunity enjoy an amazing range of delicacies from Jaffna until February 26. The Jaffna festival was initiated in Cinnamon Grand on February 16 at the hotel’s village suite, Nugagama. Under the giant Banyan tree, Yalpanam cuisine has more to it than wolfing down a Dosai or an Idly in a run of the mill ‘saivar’ kiosk. The ambience is full of Yalpanam aroma, and you will hardly feel the hours wear away as you fress the delicacies the whole night. And of course there are many more than a dosai or an idly on a platter full of enriching warmth.
The festival was inaugurated by Tourism Development Minister John Amaratunga while Tourism Development Authority Chairman Paddy Withana, John Keels Leisure Industry Group President Krishan Balendra and Cinnamon Grand General Manager Rohan Karr graced the occasion.
The event is a culmination of the intriguing food, art, music and entertainment which is part of the rich culture and heritage of Sri Lanka’s northern hemisphere, commonly known as Jaffna. The festival is open for dinner on weekdays and for both lunch and dinner on Saturdays and Sundays priced at Rs 2600. This will be a debut initiative to give metropolitans, diaspora and tourists a slice of Jaffna right here in the city of Colombo.
The Jaffna Festival became a reality thanks to five ladies to prepare more than 70 authentically Jaffna dishes using produce sourced daily from the farmers and markets of the district, artisans and spice manufacturers from Pungudutivu. The Jaffna food festival is one ideal occasion to have a different kind of dining experience with your family and friends.
For those who have heard that Hindus are either vegetarians or vegans, the surprise is in store with a separate table of sizzling pots of seafood soaked generously in spice. Smell it before tasting, and you will feel the tastebuds stirring within. And the almost countless desserts will take you to a Shangri-la.
Jaffna’s rich food culture should be an offshoot of its tropical climate and occasional rainfall. The climate is an essential ingredient that infuses aroma into spice. The Sinhalese and Tamils share a similar tongue for spice. Although South Indian food and Jaffna food are similar, the Jaffna category bears much similarity to the Sri Lankan cuisine. The guests also have a chance to enjoy beer, which no doubt gets along with spicy food more than anything else.
Walking down to this little hamlet called Nugagama, along the five-star corridor of Cinnamon Grand, you will feel the difference. Food is the thing, of course, though not everything. The ambience and culture hold much interest with the stewards attired in traditional dresses. The music as well as dance are authentically ‘imported’ from Jaffna. You are invited to delight in the cultural blend here. Go for the feel and the touch of the culture.
The ladies and gentlemen from Jaffna are well equipped to provide you with an authentic cuisine experience during the festival, in addition to demonstrations and other interactive sessions. It is a unique gateway to grasp and appreciate Jaffna’s rich cultural and culinary heritage.
Enjoy Yalpanam. It is a yummy experience.
