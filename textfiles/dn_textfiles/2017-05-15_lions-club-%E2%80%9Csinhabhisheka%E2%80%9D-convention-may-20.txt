Lions Club “Sinhabhisheka” convention on May 20

The Lions worldwide are celebrating the Centenary of Lionism which was introduced in Chicago, Illinois, USA by founder Melvin Jones, an insurance agent, who relinquished his business to engage full time in serving the less fortunate.
He would not have dreamt that the Lions Clubs International would march ahead for the 100th year while Lions in Sri Lanka celebrate the 60th year of Lionism that was brought in 1957 through India.
The Lions Clubs International District 306A2, spanning from Colombo to the District of Moneragala with 90 Lions Clubs and over 2,000 Lions will be celebrating its 12th Annual District convention called “Sinhabhisheka” on May 20 and 21 in a grand manner at the Golden Rose Banquet Hall, Boralesgamuwa under the direction of District Governor 2016/2017, Lion Dr. Athula Hikkaduwa.
The Ceremonial Session begins at 2 pm on Saturday May 20 under the patronage of Past International President, Lion Mahendra Amarasuriya PMJF and the Business Session on the following day will commence at 8.30 am under the patronage of the Past International Director, veteran Lion Sunil Watawala PMJF.
At the beginning of the Lionistic Year 2016/2017, DG Lion Dr. Athula Hikkaduwa, introduced a Five Point Programme under his theme, “Dedicated for Humanity”, covering the areas of (a) Service – To Build a Healthy Community, (b) Administration and Membership Development to Strengthen the Movement, Building to Encourage Service Minded People to Serve the Community, (d) Leadership and Youth Development to Prepare them for the Future and (e) Centennial Service Challenge to make a difference in the Community.
His novel concept was “Siha Sevana”, a Legacy Programme and District Governor challenged the Lions Clubs to build homes for deserving families as he hoped that clubs will honor his challenge by constructing at least 25 houses during his term of leadership. His dream has been exceeded by several clubs by constructing over 25 houses and hopefully, by the end of June 30, nearly 30 to 35 houses will be completed for occupation by those deserving families selected by the respective clubs.
In 2014/2015, Lions Clubs International, targeting the Centennial Celebrations in 2017 (this year) challenged over 40,000 Lions Clubs worldwide in 210 countries with four Centennial Service Challenges to serve 100 million people in the areas of youth, vision, hunger and environment and District 306A2, as a partner of these challenges, have contributed to surpass the target set by the International which had so far served more than 140 million people who have benefited under the stipulated areas. Currently, the International has extended their Centennial Service Challenges having set a goal of ameliorating the lives of more than 200 million people per year by 2021 – tripling the humanitarian impact.
District 306A2 with 90 Lions Clubs serving the less fortunate within their geographical area in a changing world and the reason for its existence is service.
