‘School van charges up 5 percent’

School van charges would be increased by 5 percent on September 25 due to the recent diesel price hike, All Ceylon Schoolchildren's Transport Service Association President Mal Sri de Silva said. He was addressing a media conference held in Kurunegala, yesterday.
De Silva said that fuel prices were likely to increase monthly, and as such, the association would also have to adjust its charges for each hike. However, he said, if fuel prices were to drop, the association would also decrease its charges.
