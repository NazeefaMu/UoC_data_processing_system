No explosion risk at Meethotamulla dump

There is no risk of an explosion at the Meethotamulla garbage dump as speculated by many since scientific research had proved there was no large amount of Methane accumulated to warrant an explosion,Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said. The Minister also said that some people and politicians had made certain baseless statements without a proper knowlege of the chances of such an explosion due to the high levels of Methane.
“The levels of Methane in the garbage dump are less than 2 percent but the Carbon Monoxide levels are very high inside which could cause an ignition. However the steps have been taken to control such a situation,” Minister Ranawaka said.
He made these observations at a press conference at the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry auditorium yesterday.
The Minister also said that within five months the dump site could be stabilised with the support of many institutions including the Tri Forces. “Work at the site would be challenging with the impending monsoon rains,” Minister Ranawaka said. “However, rehabilitation work is being done on the advice of an expert Committee,”the Minister added.
He also said that once the garbage dump is rehabilitated, the plan for the site will be revealed.
Minister Ranawaka added that the land had a very high economic value.
“No institution dared to implement the project to rehabilitation of the Meethotamulla garbage dump,” Minister Ranawaka said. “Then we, the Urban Development Authority and our ministry took over the matter. There are many who talk and criticize, but there is none to work, he said.”
Megapolis and Western Development Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna was also present.
