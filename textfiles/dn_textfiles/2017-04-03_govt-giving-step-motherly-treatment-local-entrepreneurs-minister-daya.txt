Govt giving step motherly treatment to local entrepreneurs - Minister Daya Gamage

Sri Lankan government is giving step motherly treatment to local entrepreneurs and giving preferential treatment to foreign companies accused Minister of Primary Industries, Daya Gamage.
Speaking to media in Colombo he said that if the government gives 100 local entrepreneurs all the support and assistance they can turn around Sri Lanka to be another South Korea.
“This what the Korean government did by assisting local companies like Hyundai, LG, and Samsung to be world business icons today.”
He said in contrast local companies are being texes from head to toe from the time it’s being established and even when exporting. “The previous government even created a special act to take over my Higurana sugar factory. Unfortunately the present government even after two years have failed to give my company back and do justice.”
On an earlier occasion the Ministry said that when his company was taken over none of the Chambers raised their voice or spoke against it. in public.
Gamage who is having his own domestic aviation company and involved in Micro finance‚ and several other businesses said that his company together with an US based financier forwarded his proposal to run the national carrier, SriLankan and his bid was even not short listed to be among the last five.
Whenever foreign investor obtains land for a project they are offered long term leases even up to 99 years and it’s not so for local companies where the agreement is less than 30 years.
“I can’t understand this attitude of the government and also ashamed to say that even despite being a Cabinet Minister I can not change this mindset.”
Asked if he plans to have a domestic airline with schedule flights he answered in the negative. “With the Colombo Matara highway there is hardly any one flying to Koggala and this would happen when the completion of the Colombo Kandy highway as well.”
The only opening are for the East and Jaffna and I prefer to operate charter flights from my helicopters as and when there is a requirement.
