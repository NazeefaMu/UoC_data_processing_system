Programmes to clean up Anuradhapura tanks underway

Anuradhapura Government Agent R.M. Wanninayaka said 150,000 families in the district were affected by drought and the government has spent nearly Rs. 2,500 million to provide relief for them.
He said relief programme was continuing assisted by government institutions and volunteers. Meanwhile, Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayaka has initiated a programme to clean up tanks in the district during the ongoing dry period. Anuradhapura Assistant Agrarian Services Development Commissioner Asanka Somawansa said sediment in 50 tanks was already removed and 300,000 cubic metres of silt were removed.
"We will clean up 200 more rural tanks under the Phase II of the project. Boundaries of the selected tanks were being demarcated before starting the cleaning. We will remove about 1.5 million cubic meters of sediment from small tanks.
The government has granted Rs. 800 million for the project, Somawansa said.
