Trials in labour and trade
‘SL on path to consolidating laws, curbing discrimination’

Inclusive and sustainable growth could not be achieved sans a proper approach to quell the inequalities faced by the workforce, Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister Ravindra Samaraweera said.
He was addressing the Plenary Meeting of the International Labour Conference’s (ILC) 107th Session, recently. The meeting was held from May 28 to June 9.
Highlighting a number of Sri Lanka’s achievements in the field of labour, Minister Samaraweera added that being the first country in the world to implement a National Decent Work Plan on par with the ILO’s principles, Sri Lanka had also given priority to labour rights through its inclusion in the National Human Rights Action Plan 2017-2021.
Sri Lanka was in the process of introducing a Single Employment Law, consolidating the current inefficient laws and curbing discrimination, the minister said; the country had also taken measures to prevent child labour and to promote children’s rights, while offering its support the ILO’s endeavours.
The minister highlighted the need to consider practical measures, including flexible working hours, creating a positive atmosphere for all workers, in order to increase productivity. He said trade unions could play a key role in making workers understand the changing global work environment. Stressing the need to break through prevailing stereotypes in order to achieve gender equality, he focused on the necessity for awareness-raising within society.
During his discussion with ILO Director-General Guy Ryder, Minister Samaraweera expressed Sri Lanka’s interest to be at the forefront of the ILO’s global and regional efforts, along with other relevant stakeholders striving to eliminating child and forced labour. He assured Sri Lanka’s support for declaring 2021 as the Year of Elimination of Child Labour and expressed the country’s willingness to become a Pathfinder Country of Alliance 8.7.
Sri Lanka is currently considering the ratification of ILO Protocol 29 to the Forced Labour Convention.
The ILO Director-General said Sri Lanka was an important partner of the ILO, adding that he held Sri Lanka’s ongoing efforts to promote labour rights in high regard, particularly, the measurers to eliminate child labour. In this context, Ryder recalled pledges made by Sri Lanka at the IV Global Conference on Sustained Eradication of Child Labour, in Buenos Aires, November, 2017, including to raise the minimum age of employment from 14 to 16. He also requested Sri Lanka to be actively involved in the Centenary Celebration activities of the ILO which would be held in 2019.
Minister Samaraweera was accompanied by Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka to the United Nations in Geneva Ambassador A. L. A. Azeez, Labour Commissioner-General R. P. A. Wimalaweera, Deputy Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka Samantha Jayasuriya, Minister Counsellor Shashika Somaratne, Labour and Trade Union Relations Ministry Senior Assistant Secretary B. Vasanthan and other senior officials.
