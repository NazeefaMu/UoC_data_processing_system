Unilever continues to win accolades for excellence

Unilever Sri Lanka was recognized for excellence HR practices at the SHIFT 2020 - Sri Lanka Human Capital Management (HCM) Awards 2016 held recently in Colombo.
Home to some of the country’s most loved brands, the company received the coveted overall Gold award for “Best HR Practices in the Country”, the highest accolade awarded at the event.
Competing with some of the country’s leading public and private sector enterprises from across a diverse mix of industries, Unilever also took home special category awards for the “Best Rewards and Recognition” and “Best Support Given for Business Transformation” categories.
“We are honoured to be recognized yet again for our commitment to engaging and developing our most prized assets - our employees,” said Sumeet Verma, Director – Human Resources and Corporate Relations, Unilever Sri Lanka. “At Unilever we have a simple but clear purpose – to make sustainable living commonplace. As firm believers in ‘Doing Well by Doing Good’, we have integrated our sustainability goals to the goals of the business.”
“Our ingenious teams around the world derive great pride and inspiration from this vision and are striving tirelessly to help us live it.
We truly appreciate their continued contributions and seek to empower them further by aligning our career management efforts with their individual needs, aspirations and purpose. As we continue to place great emphasis on and invest in their all-round development and wellbeing, we will also keep engaging with schools and universities to develop the next generation of business leaders.”
All this has resulted in Unilever being consistently recognized as one of the world's most admired employers. In Sri Lanka, the company has the distinction of being consistently ranked as the overall “No.1 Employer of Choice” in Nielsen’s Employer of Choice survey for the past four years. It has also received several accolades at the National HR Conference, one of the country’s foremost HR forums organized by the Institute of Personnel Management (IPM) Sri Lanka.
The Sri Lanka Human Capital Management (HCM) Awards are presented once in two years by the Association of Human Resource Professionals Sri Lanka, the only professional network of practicing HR professionals in Sri Lanka. The awards are aimed at recognizing public and private sector organizations that stay abreast of the latest developments in human capital management and have effectively demonstrated innovative and inspiring HR practices.
