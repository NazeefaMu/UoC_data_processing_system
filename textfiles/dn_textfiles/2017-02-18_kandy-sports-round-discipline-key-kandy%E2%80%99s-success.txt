KANDY SPORTS ROUND UP: Discipline - key to Kandy’s success

“Dedication of the players, the discipline they followed and the support they got from the superiors and the vociferous fans was what really made our team a formidable force in rugby,” said chairman of Kandy Sports Club rugby Lasantha Wijesuriya, a former St. Anthony’s College, Outstation Schools, Combined Schools, CH & FC, Kandy SC and Sri Lanka back division player and the first to lead the Nittawela club to become unbeaten triple champions. Considering the immense success Kandy ruggerites have achieved, Wijesuriya described by many as a top gentleman in rugby further said. “With my experience I was able to get things done, because being dedicated I had excellent players to guide.” Wijesuriya didn’t want to single out any particular player but had some encouraging words for the entire squad. Lasantha took over the mantle of chairmanship over 15 years ago. He gave a prompt answer when asked how and why Kandy SC has been able to reign for so long. “When I took over as chairman things were not new to me, because I was player, captain and coach. I know about every player’s rugby and most of the players have played for many years for my club. Briefly it is a continuation, when some player moves out I get a similar replacement.” Commanding a rugby force around 40 players has been a pleasure for Lasantha who hails some of the other players in clubs as being dedicated to their task, but regretted they don’t get enough team support. But he was quick to reason out as to why no side has been able to beat his men in the second round. He said that Kandy has got that physical strength needed for a game of this sort and it wouldn’t be fair to single out rival players who make a vain attempt to match them. “My men are physically strong; they can last the pace, resist any onslaught and have got the stamina.” As for the future of Kandy S.C. rugby he was optimistic of his men keeping the flame burning bright for many more years. He also thanked the Kandy Sports Club members, fans and the media for all the support they have given them.

Two from Kandy invited for rugby workshop

The Asian Rugby will cover ground costs of accommodation and food. The Referees controlling body in Sri Lanka has come forward to pay the passage for Jayasinghe, but sad to say Gunaratne is still without a sponsor for his ticket nd his visit is in the balance. A few days back a lady official from the Japan Rugby Union Aiya Nakumar came to Kandy to evaluate their Rugby Volunteer Coach Yuri Itaco who is stationed in Kandy. She met some of the officials of the CPRFU and had a long discussion. She said that Japan offers several rugby development workshops and would invite young and good prospects from Sri Lanka, they should be of good standard, currently involved in rugby coaching in the schools sector with the knowledge of English to gather what is conducted at the work-shop. Sending someone with past records will not be sufficient as all rugby coaching trends have changed and good material should be sent so that they come back and share their experience they had at the workshop.
