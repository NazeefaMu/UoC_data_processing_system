Raids on errant traders net over Rs. 95 mn

Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) carried out about 25,708 raids in markets countrywide last year and errant traders were produced before courts for legal action for 25,082 raids.
The CAA has contributed Rs. 98.2 million to government revenue by fining the errant traders.
The CAA has received about 2,301 complaints over malpractices and injustices caused to the consumers and these complaints are now being investigated, A.M. Premaratne, senior investigation officer, of the CAA in Kurunegala on Wednesday said.
