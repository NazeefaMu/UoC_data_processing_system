Ban Ajinomoto - GMOA

 The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) has called the government to ban Ajinomoto (MSG).
GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said they will brief the President and the Health Minister on the health issues in the use of Ajinomoto.
He said that media had reported the ban of Ajinomoto in Pakistan. Sri Lankan farmers too use Ajinomoto as a pesticide and insecticide since 2015 after the ban on Glyphosate and since 2015 the import of Ajinomoto to Sri Lanka has shown an alarming increase, he said.
According to Dr. Aluthge, foetus expose to a high dose of MSG causes autism to develop and overactive behaviour. It also leads to low weight births with danger of developing diabetes and overweight. The research done using animals had proved that MSG also causes diabetes, hypertension (high blood pressure) and over weight.
Some restaurants and eating houses add a few tea spoons of Ajinomoto into food, especially into Koththu which is highly dangerous and over the approved levels. The President has already launched a programme to promote poison free food, he added.
