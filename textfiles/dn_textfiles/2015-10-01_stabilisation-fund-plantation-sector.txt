Stabilisation Fund for plantation sector

A Stabilisation Fund for the plantation sector has to be set up to solve issues which arise with the fluctuation of prices of their products in the world market, Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake said.
He said the government has to pay concessions to the plantation sector when the prices of tea, rubber and coconuts in the world market drop.
Dissanayake said it was the tax money collected from the people which is given as concession to this sector to stabilise the industry and the social and economic aspect of plantation sector employees. He said plantation companies have not paid a single extra cent to the government when they earned profits.
Dissanayake said the government has paid around Rs. 7 billion during the last nine months as concession to this sector.
The minister made these observations at a press conference at the Plantation Industries Ministry yesterday.
Dissanayake said due to various reasons the prices of tea and rubber fluctuate.
He said the government continues to grant this concessions to create an artificial high price to these products.
