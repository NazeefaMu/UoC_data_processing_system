Web journalists hail data levy removal

The Web Journalists’ Association yesterday hailed the government’s decision to remove the10% telecommunications levy imposed on data. They urged the government that a concession be provided to post paid data packages as it has done to the pre paid packages.
The Web Journalists’ Association said the government has positively responded to their request and it will lead to increase the readers’ accessibility for news websites.
Meanwhile, the Web Journalists’ Association further urged the Mass Media Minister that a concessionary special data package be provided to all journalists as well.
They further urged Media Minister that a comprehensive training programme be provided to web journalists regarding media ethics.
Web Journalists’ Association convener Freddie Gamage, committee members Wimukthi Dushyantha and Praboda Chinthaka participated in the press conference held at the Government Information Department.
