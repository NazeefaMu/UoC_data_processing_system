Two teams to prevent Jumbo invasion of stadium

The Department of Wild Life has deployed two teams of officers to prevent wild elephants from invading the Sooriyawewa Cricket Stadium and causing damage to its property particularly during the cricketing season.
Range Officer J. A. R. Wijayakumara said the stadium is prone to wild elephant attacks since a herd of 34 elephants including baby elephants were roaming in the surrounding area.
