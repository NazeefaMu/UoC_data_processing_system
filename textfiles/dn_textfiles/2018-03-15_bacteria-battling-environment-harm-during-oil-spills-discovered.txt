Bacteria battling environment harm during oil spills discovered

K. P. Dulan Tharaka, a student of the Colombo University Botany Department has discovered three types of environment-friendly bacteria which can be used as a weathering agent during oil spills to prevent harm to the environment.
Tharaka says that he had stored these three types of bacteria in a laboratory at the university under a temperature of minus 20 degrees Celsius to be used during an emergency situation. The find includes two types of bacteria known as Bacillus SP and another type known as Pseudomonas SP.
He says this bacteria can be utilised to prevent any environmental damage during an oil spill in the ocean or on land as a bio-remediation agent. He produced the bacteria by using soil and water samples soiled by petroleum waste at the Sapugaskanda oil refinery premises.
He conducted the research under the supervision and concept of Senior Lecturers Dr. Anil Jayasekara and Dr. Chandrika Nanayakkara.
