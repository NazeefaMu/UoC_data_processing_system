JK Foundation conducts campaign for Elimination of Violence Against Women

John Keells (JK) Foundation is conducting a public transport campaign today (Monday) to coincide with the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, for the third successive year.
This year’s campaign is targeting bus commuters within the Colombo City limits through a sticker and leaflet campaign with a particular focus on the importance of reporting incidents of sexual harassment. Teams of volunteers from John Keells Foundation will be carrying out the campaign in prominent locations in Colombo including bus stands in Pettah, Borella, Gunasinghepura and Bastian Mawatha throughout the day to create awareness.
It is is one of the many initiatives of the John Keells Foundation under this year’s theme ‘See it, Report it, Prevent it’ and the campaign will be conducted with the approval and cooperation of both the Sri Lanka Transport Board and Western Province Provincial Road Passenger Transport Authority (private bus authority).
Today (Monday) is marked as the international Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, uniting people worldwide in raising awareness of, and collective action to, end violence against women and girls.
“Combating gender-based violence (GBV) is a primary concern for the John Keells Group underlined by our Policy against Sexual Harassment which is based on zero tolerance for any form of sexual harassment in the workplace and our responsibility to create a workplace free of harassment. lt is also a key focus of our CSR via John Keells Foundation (JKF),” Chairman, John Keells Holdings, Susantha Ratnayake stated.
ln November 2014, JKF launched ‘Project WAVE’ (Working Against Violence through Education) as a phased awareness campaign to combat GBV and child abuse focusing on Group employees, targeted extemal communities and the general public.
Sensitization programmes have also been conducted for select external populations such as police officers, lawyers, school children and community members while two successful public campaigns against sexual harassment on public transport have been undertaken targeting both bus and rail commuters, with the Project impacting over 223,000 persons to date.
The public campaign will be complemented by an internal poster campaign including customer interfaces of Group businesses.
