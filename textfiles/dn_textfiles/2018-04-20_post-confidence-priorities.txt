Post-confidence priorities

Political analysts have given many reasons for the very poor results obtained at the Local Government elections held on February 10, 2018, by the main coalition partners of the Unity Government – the UNP and the SLFP. It is argued that the low percentage of votes is a warning to the incumbent government that the average voter is not satisfied with the performance of the unity government during the last three years. In this article, I attempt to discuss how rational the decision of the average voter is who constituted the majority of the electorate when they exercised their sovereign right to vote and the priorities for the government which has only two more years to complete its term of administration.
The national unity government was formed in 2015 with the intention of reversing the practices and policies of the Rajapaksa regime which were anti-democratic and inconsistent with good governance. The government under the leadership of the President and the Prime Minister has taken some steps in the direction of satisfying the people. For example, the 19th Amendment to the Constitution can be regarded as a great achievement. This amendment abolished the draconian 18th Amendment and established the Constitutional Council and the independent Commissions such as the Police Commission and the Judicial Service Commission. All these independent Commissions are now functioning with a sense of responsibility. This amendment also contributed to restore and strengthen the independence of the judiciary.
The incumbent Government which promised the people a corruption-free administration has taken several initiatives for establishing an effective institutional structure for investigating the allegations of corrupt deals such as taking bribes, money laundering and misappropriating funds belonging to the state institutions and institute legal proceedings against politicians and public officials of the former government. However, the people have lost confidence in the effectiveness and capability of the government to take legal action against political leaders of the former government. The people had lost confidence in the legal system because of the inordinate delay occurred in completing investigations and also in hearing cases filed after an investigation.
A factor that contributed to the complete erosion of public confidence in the government is the Central Bank Bond sale case. The President under irresistible pressure for action appointed the Commission for Investigation of Treasury Bond Scams in 2015 and 2016. The suspects in the Treasury Bond issues have already been charged under the Offences Against Public Property Act. Introducing the Judicature (Amendment) Bill in Parliament to set up a permanent High Court-at-Bar to expeditiously dispose of cases involving economic and financial crimes of very serious and complex nature is a commendable initiative taken by the government. The High Court-at-Bar consisting of three judges of the High Court will hold trials day-to-day for expeditious disposal of cases referred to it.
Economic factor
During the Local Government election propaganda campaign, the Joint Opposition emphasized the economic difficulties faced by the people due to the increasing prices of essential food items such as rice and coconut. Sri Lanka experienced a drought which continued for more than two years which affected the rice cultivation and also the coconut production. However, the average voter expressed his sense of disappointment with the government by voting against the parties in power. The feeling that the government should have provided some relief by making the essential items available to the people at an affordable price and also that the government should provide some relief to the farmers by way of an insurance scheme or by some other arrangement is justifiable. The paddy cultivators also complained that fertilizer was not available on the open market.
It appears that the overall economic situation in the country is not satisfactory. The rate of economic growth remains at 3.1 percent during the last 16 years and the value of the rupee is gradually falling against the US dollar. There is also a big burden of foreign debt settlement as a result of obtaining foreign loans, mainly from China, for infrastructure development. As such, there is an urgent need to review and make necessary changes in economic planning by a body of economic and financial experts. However, under the leadership of the President and the Prime Minister, we can observe some positive developments also. We can see the progress made in the construction of a network of highways. Investors, both local and foreign, will welcome these connectivity projects. This government has not completely forgotten the rural farmer in the Dry Zone during the three year period of its administration. Moragahakanda Dam construction project was completed last year to provide an adequate quantity of water to the five great tanks in the region.
Unity of the coalition partners
The main factor that contributed to the dwindling public support for the coalition partners of the National Unity Government is the apparent lack of unity among the coalition partners, the SLFP and the UNP. There are even some ministers in the Cabinet who criticize the policies of the government. Some members of the SLFP even suggest that they should sever all their connections with the UNP and form a separate government. They even suggest that they should cooperate with the SLPP led by Mahinda Rajapaksa. Therefore, the need of the hour is to strengthen the unity between the SLFP led by the President and the UNP led by the Prime Minister. The total disregard for the principle of collective responsibility by some members of the Cabinet was demonstrated when they voted in support of the no-confidence motion against the Prime Minister on April 04, 2018. Therefore, a Cabinet reshuffle aimed at forming a government with ministers who are genuinely committed for achieving the common objectives of forming the National Unity Government, after the regime change in 2015, is a matter to which top priority should be given.
Post-war reconciliation process
After the end of the war in 2009, the Sri Lankan government has done a considerable amount of work to bring about reconciliation between the Sinhalese community and the Tamil community. The United Nations too has assumed a significant role by recommending what steps should be taken by the Sri Lankan government for genuine reconciliation to ensure real and sustainable peace. In compliance with the commitments undertaken by Sri Lanka by co-sponsoring the UNHRC Resolution 30/1, Sri Lanka has enacted Enforced Disappearances Act in March this year. The Office of Missing Persons too was set up by appointing the Commissioners. Legislation has already been drafted for the establishment of an Office to handle Reparations and a Truth Commission.
Regarding the recommendation for the establishment of a tribunal for hearing cases regarding the allegations of violations of international human rights law, and international humanitarian law during the last stage of the war, by the Sri Lankan armed forces and the LTTE, consisting of both local and foreign judges, there is serious objection by the Joint Opposition and by some civil society groups. However, the President has expressed the position that he is against the inclusion of foreign judges in such tribunals. The Sri Lankan delegation that represented Sri Lanka at the 37th session of the UNHRC has brought to the attention of the members of the UNHRC that the Sri Lankan government’s position is that there is no need to include foreign judges in such tribunals for the reason that, according to the Foreign Minister Marapana, “Sri Lanka’s judiciary and law enforcement mechanisms are fully capable of and committed to the processes of advancing justice to all concerned. It has a long history of integrity and professionalism….”
Although the Sri-Lankan government has co-sponsored the resolution 30/1, the Sri-Lankan government’s position is that the Eelam War IV was a humanitarian operation and our soldiers have not committed any violations amounting to war crimes. However, since there is a serious allegation by the international community and the United Nations against the armed forces, it is necessary to hold a credible investigation acceptable to the United Nations regarding these allegations for the purpose of clearing the good name of the armed forces who carried out the military operations with due regard to the rights of the civilians and also the human rights of the LTTE fighters. There is, however, vehement objection to the entire reconciliation process by the political parties of the Joint Opposition and some civil society organisations, especially a section of the Buddhist priests and some retired military officers who are engaged in a propaganda campaign for toppling the reconciliation process by toppling the government.
The critics of the reconciliation process vehemently oppose the proposed constitutional reforms too. They propagate the idea that the new constitution would fulfill the aspirations of the sponsors of UNHRC resolutions, the USA and other countries supporting it and more specifically the Tamil Diaspora. The liberal political parties of the North and East Sri Lanka who are in the Tamil National Alliance have categorically stated that they are for a united, undivided and indivisible Sri Lanka. They state that what they need is a substantial devolution of power to the Provincial Councils, that too within a unitary form of government to make the devolution of power meaningful and some reasonable power-sharing at the Centre.
