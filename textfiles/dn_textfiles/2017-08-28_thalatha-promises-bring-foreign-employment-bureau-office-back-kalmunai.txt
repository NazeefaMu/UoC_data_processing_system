Thalatha promises to bring Foreign Employment Bureau office back to Kalmunai

 
“The Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBF) office will be brought back to Kalmunai,” Foreign Employment and Justice Minister Thalatha Athukorale said yesterday.
 She said this while addressing a gathering held at the Divisional Secretariat, Sainthamaruthu.
 “Requests have been made to relocate the SLBF office to Kalmunai. The City Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauff Hakeem and other Parliamentarians urged the Ministry to shift the office back to Kalmunai.”
 “Action will be taken shortly to fulfil all the requests made regarding the SLBF Office,” Minister Athukorale said.
 She alleged some unidentified individuals to have damaged State property while the Foreign Employment Bureau office was shifted from Kalmunai.
 “If those culprits are identified, severe action will be taken against their activities,” she said.
