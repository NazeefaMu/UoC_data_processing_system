Melee in SPC

Pandemonium reigned at the Southern Provincial Council meeting yesterday with members raising the cost of living issue displaying samples of rice, dhal, coconuts and, other food items brought in to the house. Normalcy returned to the meeting when the chairman allowed member Channa Saliya Mendis to raise a privilege issue.
