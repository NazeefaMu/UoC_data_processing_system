Ringgit opens at 4.44 against US dollar

The ringgit opened slightly lower against the US dollar on low demand following the further strengthening of the greenback, dealers said. The local unit was traded at 4.4450/4500 against the US dollar close of 4.4420/4470.
A dealer said the US dollar was higher following a smooth outcome of the US-Japan summit held over the weekend.
The two-day meeting discussed issues including trade, currency and security matters between both countries. “Following the meeting, the US dollar rose 15 per cent against other major currencies on demand by traders, hence a weakening ringgit,” the dealer said. (Strait Times)
