Rukmalgama CC completes  2nd round in style

Rukmalgama CC completed their quota of matches on a winning note with a convincing 48 runs win over Darusalam CC in the Colombo District Cricket Association (CDCA) Division III 50 –Over League Tournament 2nd round match played at Padukka recently.
Earlier they beat Royal Worriers CC andd lost to Bloomfield.
Rukmalgama batting first, was looking down the barrel at one stage – 67/5. Damith Weerasinghe (48) and Manoj Jayaweera (32) steadied the ship with a gutsy 86 runs stand for the sixth wicket, to finish with a respectable 177 in 46.1 overs.
Darusalam started off badly losing both their openers early to the pace of Heshan Wijesinghe and lost two more wickets to leg spinner, Ranjan Ranatunga 55/4.
Ranjan Ranatunga continued to torment the rest of the batsmen, finishing with excellent figures of 7.2 -1-37-6, to send Darusalam crashing to 129 in 28.2 overs.
Ranjan Ranatunga, so far has a haul of 27 wickets in 07 matches. This RCC win came as a farewell gift to their Past President / captain, Wicket Keeper/ opening batsman, Sahan Wijeratne (2010 – 2018), who will hang up
hit boots up from competitive cricket all together.
