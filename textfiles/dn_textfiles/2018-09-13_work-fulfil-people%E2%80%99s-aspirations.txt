March 12 Movement tells Peoples’ representatives:
Work to fulfil people’s aspirations

The March 12 Movement yesterday, urged the Peoples’ representatives to work effectively in order to fulfill the aspirations of the people.
Although there is at least one people’s representative for every 2,170 citizens in the country, it doubtful whether they serve the public in a meaningful way, PAFFREL Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi said.
There are 9,215 people’s representatives in the country including 225 Members of Parliament, 455 Provincial Councillors and 8,535 members of Local Government bodies to deliver the demands of the citizens. Massive funds amounting to millions of rupees are incurred monthly in terms of salaries, allowances, vehicles, fuel, telephones, office staff and security in maintaining them. But, it is doubtful whether the majority of people’s representatives do fulfill their responsibilities on behalf of the people.
Addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, Hettiarachchi said it is regrettable that Parliament which meets only eight days per month had to be adjourned on most days due to the lack of quorum. The postponement of Parliament due to the lack of quorum of 20 members was reported several times in the recent past. It was a huge waste of public money as the cost for Parliamentary meetings would amount approximately to Rs.4.5 million per day.
“We insist that it is the responsibility of the Leader of the House and the leaders of all political parties to take measures to prevent this situation. The March 12 Movement firmly requests from all Members of Parliament to fulfill their duty to the people of this country whom they represent with a high sense of responsibility and accountability,” the PAFFREL Executive Director said.
Hettiarachchi said the careless manner in which the people’s representatives tend to spend public funds for their comfort became evident in the recent attempt of the Western Provincial Council to buy super luxury chairs at an exorbitant price of Rs.650,000 per chair for the Council.The poor families are granted only Rs.Rs.500,000 by this government to build a house for them under the state housing programme. So, how could anyone with a proper sense of justice justify the spending of Rs.650,000 for a chair for a council.
“On the other hand, how many of the people’s representatives are in prisons at present due to engaging in anti social activities and misuse of power and public funds,he said.
Hettiarachchi said that all people’s representatives should work together to fulfill the people’s aspirations.
