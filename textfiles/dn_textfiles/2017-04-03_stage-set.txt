Stage is set...

As actors live and die on the stage, posterity is not something that they are overly concerned about. It’s the lure of the arc lights, no matter how fleeting, that provides them with the gumption and spirit to perform.
Theatre lovers are bound to be delighted with an interesting mix of themes to be showcased in a forthcoming Colombo International Theatre Festival (CITF) 2017. This is the sixth edition of the event. Six Sri Lankan stage plays and six foreign productions from countries like Germany, India, Belarus, Sweden and France will be staging at the British School in Colombo from April 4 to 9. A few children’s dramas too will be shown at the event.
The CITF 2017 inauguration will take place on April 3 at the Mt Lavinia hotel with the participation of veteran Japanese dramatist Kengiro Otani as the guest of honour. It is organized by the Inter Act Art Black Box Theatre House and spearheaded by a team of dramatists and scholars led by the festival director M Safeer.
Seasoned theater personality Lucian Bulathsinhala will be felicitated for his invaluable contribution arts and theater at the inaugural ceremony. Prof Ediriweera Sarachchandra, K B Herath and Parakrama Niriella were honoured at the past CITFs.
Spreading out its wings this year’s CITF will hold a parallel stage drama festival which was held in Batticaloa at the Swamy Vipulananda Institute of Aesthetic Studies from March 31 to April 2.
Another event linked with the festival – the Colombo Theater Forum alias the International Directors Conference will be held from April 5 to 7 at the German Cultural Centre. 25 local directors and 15 foreign directors will hold discussions at the event. The Colombo Theater Workshop will be held from April 5 to 9 at the Indian Cultural Centre. Foreign and local playwrights and scholars will be featured at the event.
