Plantation sector patients stranded by GMOA strike

The token strike launched against the Sri Lanka - Singapore Free Trade Agreement by the members of the GMOA caused severe inconvenience to patients in the plantation sector yesterday.
Thousands of plantation workers who attended OPD and other clinics at base and rural hospitals in the plantations had to return home distraught, as all clinics and departments were dysfunctioning due to the strike.
