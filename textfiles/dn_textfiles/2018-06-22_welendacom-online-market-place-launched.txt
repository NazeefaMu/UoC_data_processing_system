Welenda.com, online market place launched

Welenda.com, an online market place has been established allowing Sri Lankan businesses to reach international market with ease.
The e- market place is considered be a ground-breaking online business venture allowing Sri Lankan businesses and industries to break barriers and reach the international market, was launched in the US recently.
The online retail service which opens up a new avenue for Sri Lankan businesses and industries underscores the message that Sri Lanka is ready to make its presence felt in the international market.
It can also be described as the Sri Lankan version of Aliexpress, an online retail platform owned by Chinese firm Alibaba that is fast gaining popularity in key markets across the world.
The founder of the platform is Chamli Tennakoon, a Sri Lankan living in the US, who has wide-ranging experience in the fields of digital strategy and digital marketing.
“It is true that online shopping is gaining momentum in the Sri Lankan market. But we saw a vacuum in the online shopping landscape in Sri Lanka as it did not offer a window of opportunity for local businesses to enter the international market. That as where we, Welenda.com, come into play,” Tennakoon said.
“Sri Lanka, we believe, has a lot to offer to the international market. At the same time, Sri Lanka is ready to conquer the global market, despite its size. Some Sri Lankan brands have already transcended our boundaries and become key global brands. We simply want to expand the horizons for Sri Lankan businesses,” he added.
Welenda.com, Tennakoon says, guarantees the most reasonable prices for the products on offer.
“Welenda backend AI can find the value range of any product that we list on the website, but still if a customer finds the same product at a lower price within 24 hours of purchasing, we’ll refund the customer 100% of the difference,” he added.
“That’s what differentiates us from other e-commerce platforms. There are no hidden costs. That way we have ensured maximum benefits for those shopping on our platform,” he added. Welenda.com will be functional from June 30 and Tennakoon says he has already drawn plans to further expand its services during the phase II development stage.
