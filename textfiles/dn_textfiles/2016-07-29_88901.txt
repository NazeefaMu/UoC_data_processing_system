Lankan hopes at Rio Olympics: KIMIKO RAHEEM

 
The youngest of the three Raheem sisters, who have made a revolution in Sri Lanka swimming, – Kimiko is set to take family traditions in sport to the Olympic level once more when she competes at the Rio 2016 Games.
After the medal-winning performances of her elder sisters – Mayumi and Machiko Raheem at the South Asia Games, young Kimiko became the female competitor with the most number of gold medals at the 2016 South Asian Games in India.
It was a commendable moment for the 17-year-old youngster to win five gold medals in the women’s 50m backstroke, 100m backstroke, 200m backstroke, 50m freestyle, 100m freestyle and 4 x 100m freestyle at the last South Asian Games in Guwahati. Her elder sister Mayumi - Beijing 2008 Olympian, was a household name during her era after her triple gold medals at the 2006 South Asian Games in Colombo.
While Kimiko was invincible in the South Asian swim arena, her elder sister Machiko won the women’s 200m freestyle silver medal in Guwahati.
Fresh after a one-year FINA scholarship in Thailand, Kimiko is in good shape for her pet event the women’s 100m backstroke at next month’s Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
“It was a good experience in Thailand. I was under a FINA scholarship. We had year-long fulltime hard training in Phuket. It was really useful, to have two to three training sessions a day – 16 sessions per week in total, apart from workouts at gymnasium,” she said.
“I am glad that I had that kind of intensive training. We had a group of 25 swimmers and eight of them would be competing in Rio. We were trained by Spanish coach Miguel Lopez who made a lot of effort to sharpen our skills.
Our coaches in Phuket worked really hard. That was an ideal lead up for the Olympic Games,” she said.
Kimiko, in her last international event before the Olympics - the 2016 Thailand Age Group Swimming Championship, bagged six gold medals in the women’s 50m backstroke, 100m backstroke, 200m backstroke, 50m freestyle, 100m freestyle and 200m freestyle. Yet, she is unhappy that she had missed the Olympic qualifying timing in the women’s 100m backstroke by a whisker.
“I was aiming at the Olympic qualification mark of 1:02.36 in the 100m backstroke event but I missed it by a mere 0.27 seconds. Nevertheless, I will make every endeavor to go past that in Rio,” a determined Kimiko said.
With only a couple of days away from her departure to Brazil with the Sri Lanka contingent, Kimiko is trying hard to adjust herself to Rio time which is ten hours behind Phuket for which she has been used to for the past one year. “At the moment, I struggle a bit to adjust to the time difference.
But I should be alright in two to three days,” she added.
It was the family tradition which has influenced young Kimiko to master swimming. “I think I was just two years when my parents had first taken me to a pool. But I started serious training from the age of five years.
Obviously, I was influenced by my two elder sisters. I liked it very much and followed their footsteps. On the other hand, the sports backgrounds of my parents too have been an inspiration to the three of us,” she said.
Her father had been a swimmer and a rugby player (Ramzy who is a well-known airline pilot) and mother (Ranjika) had been an athlete during their school careers. The Raheems have had a passion for sport, prompting their three daughters to become South Asian Games medallists, sharing eight gold medals, seven silver medals and five bronze medals amongst them in two South Asian Games, a feat which is hard to emulate.
At the 2016 South Asian Games, Mayumi’s younger sisters secured first and second places in the 50m freestyle event with Kimiko taking the gold in 26.49 seconds followed by her elder sister Machiko who clocked in at 27.4 and ended up with five silver medals and a bronze.
“My dream was to make it to the Olympics and I am happy that it is going to become a reality in Rio. I will try my level best to make my presence felt, go pass Olympic qualification timing and also to renew my Sri Lanka record.
It is going to be a tough task but I am equally geared to achieve my target,” Kimiko said.
She plans to get back to Thailand after Olympic Games to complete the last two years of her high school career. “I have got a full scholarship at the British International School there. I will be completing last two years of my school career. Actually, I am one year behind as I sacrificed full 12 months for my FINA training before the Olympics,” she said.
Kimiko’s ultimate target as a sports personality is to “achieve something nobody has done before!” “The Rio 2016 Games will be a big experience and exposure for me. I will work harder and set my targets at 2020 Olympics, to gain qualifying standards and then make it to at least semi-finals. I also want to make it to the finals or semi-finals of a FINA World Championship,” she said.
