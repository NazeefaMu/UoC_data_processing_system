CLARIFICATION

In reference to our news report on the launch of a book “Lalith Athulathmudali Assassination” published on May 5, Dayantha Athulathmudali, brother of late Lalith Athulathmudali has sent us the following clarification.
“I wish to bring to your notice about an incorrect choice of words in the last paragraph of an article that appeared in today’s Daily News. In the last paragraph, your reporter says:
Dayanthe Athulathmudali, Lalith’s brother, delivering a speech lambasted the government for failing to reach a proper verdict in the case.
“I have attached the very text I used as the last speaker on that occasion at the OPA.
“You will notice that I have NOT lambasted the Govt. nor have I expected the Govt. to reach a verdict. What should have been correct for your reporter to have stated was that I blamed the Police and the Attorney General’s Departments. for taking No action after the Presidential Commission submitted its report. I lamented that this state of continued disinterest by these two Departments has led to Lalith’s murder remaining unsolved to date.
“I expect that you will inform your readers of what should have been printed”.
