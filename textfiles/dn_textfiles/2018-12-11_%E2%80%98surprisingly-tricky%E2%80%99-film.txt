‘Surprisingly  tricky’  to film

It boasts the same team that managed to create the incredibly complex ‘Lord of the Rings’ franchise, but there was still one key element that made ‘Mortal Engines’ really difficult to film.
The $AU137 million adaptation of Philip Reeves’ book is Oscar-winning director Peter Jackson’s first major film since ‘Lord of the Rings’.
Speaking to news.com.au, Jackson - who worked as a screenwriter and producer for ‘Mortal Engines’ — admitted that despite finding a way to bring Tolkien’s Middle Earth to the big screen, there were parts of this production which proved “surprisingly tricky”.
‘Mortal Engines’ follows the story of mysterious young woman Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar) - who’s hellbent on revenge for her mother’s death - in a world set hundreds of years after civilisation was destroyed by a cataclysmic event, where gigantic moving cities now roam the Earth, ruthlessly preying upon smaller traction towns.
