Postal strikers invited for discussion

The Postal Department had requested the postal trade unions to end their strike and enter into discussions with the Department.
A statement issued by the Government Information Department stated that the Minister of Posts and the Postmaster General had accepted the fairness of the issues presented and they would be resolved within a month after having discussions with the trade unions.
The Postmaster General had stated that the department had been conducting the service for over 200 years, and will be responsible for the problems faced by the public. The Postal Department workers would undergo difficulties if the strike continued and the 200-year-old service would be disrupted.
Postal Trade Unions Convenor Chinthaka Bandara stated that the trade unions are ready to discuss with the authorities, but the strike would not be called off until the demands are met.
“The department is incurring a huge loss due to the strike, and the President, the Prime Minister and the Minister of Posts should intervene and meet the demands,” he said. The postal services halted from June 11 with the joint trade union strike launched by 23,000 employees of 24 Postal Services unions. Services at 653 post offices, 3,410 sub-post offices and 100 control officers were also disrupted.
Over 1,500 airmail sacks were piled up at the BIA Airport and at the Central Mail Exchange (CME) as island-wide mail collection and distribution came to a standstill.
Bandara said the strike was carried out on two demands including the demand to amend the recruitment process and to make sub post masters permanent.
