No suspense, no tension

Bryan Singer's ‘X-Men: Apocalypse’ takes us back in history to the origin of the X Men. The setting is a classroom, and a teacher lectures middle school students. The year in discussion is 1973, when the vigilante mutant Mystique accidentally exposed her kind to the rest of the world.
Unfortunately, Singer's latest venture to the X-Men universe has its sights set lower than the altering of history. This is to be expected since ‘Days of Future Past’ drew a lot of its power from the need for revisionism, especially after Brett Ratner's blood-thirsty ‘X-Men: The Last Stand’ in 2006.
Psylocke, Apocalypse and Magneto
The success formula of the previous two ‘X-Men’ reboots is the fact that both did not comprise a villain. ‘X-Men: First Class’ saw the story of two gifted friends who meet at a crossroad of history and become great friends.
Central antagonist
The issue with ‘X-Men: Apocalypse’ is that Singer could have taken the story to so many directions but still chooses an overly hackneyed one. Almost all the stunts involved in the film set off a déjà vu aura.
A feature to note is that the latest villain of the series has nothing unique about him. He is vaguely alien and has been waiting to take his vengeance from mankind for a long time. Named En Sabah Nur, aka Apocalypse he wishes to cleanse the earth of the weak and rebuild it anew. He is the central antagonist, the ancient mutant who rises from the pyramids, an archetypal villain that has no organic connection with the first two movies. It feels like an excuse to bring the X-Men back into action. This factor has been present in almost all the superhero movies up-to-date.
The film opens in 3000 BC Egypt. We see a supernatural force shaking up a pyramid. As bodies are buried under what seems like a catastrophe, we are left confused about what exactly happened. A dazzling time travel through the birth of Christ and other political and cultural signposts bring us to the 1980s. When the ancient mutant En Sabah Nur wakes up thousands of years later sending vibrations across the earth, it changes the lives of the X-Men, who are living in peace.
Diverse powers
The film is best when engaging its actors' strengths. Each superhero has diverse powers. One of the most entertaining events of the movie is when Quicksilver comes to the rescue. His episodes of rescuing students and a dog from Professor Xaevier’s school is a joy to watch. Even the cast's new additions: Sophie Turner as telepath Jean Grey and Tye Sheridan as Scott Summers, alias Cyclops seem equipped to give their roles some depth of feeling.
James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Oscar Isaac, Nicholas Hoult, and Evan Peters play some of the other significant roles
Though the movie is a shade darker than the previous ones. It recycles most of the most elements of the earlier two films: family, friendship and the eternal question if mutants are better humans than humans themselves.
If you are a great X-Men fan, you will enjoy this movie. Otherwise you will feel like you are seeing fragments of some superhero films you have already seen in the past. ‘X-Men: Apocalypse’ is screening at Majestic Cineplex and Savoy theatre.
