Back when pop music was literary

As a commentary on Jacobean tragedy, Echo and the Bunnymen’s 1983 track, “The White Devil”, is of limited use. It doesn’t tell us much that is original or penetrating about its subject, the playwright John Webster:
John Webster was / One of the best there was / He was the author of / Two major tragedies / The White Devil and / The Duchess of Malfi / The White Devil and / The Duchess of Malfi
As a reflection of the state of pop in the early 1980s, though, the song has more value. Never mind how prosaic are the words of singer and songwriter Ian McCullough; what is significant is that Echo and the Bunnymen, no strangers to the upper end of the singles charts, regular visitors to Top of the Pops, saw fit to write about a seventeenth-century dramatist (other than, of course, the most famous one). In this – turning to literature for raw material – the band were far from alone among their contemporaries.
Released the same year as “The White Devil” was Spandau Ballet’s “True”. “Take your seaside arms and write the next line”, declares Tony Hadley, a touch obscurely, at one of the song’s many moments of unbearable emotional drama (unbearable for the singer, and perhaps the listener too). That peculiar line, the songwriter Gary Kemp has since clarified, was a reference to a passage in Lolita where Humbert Humbert is haunted by the memory of a “little girl with her seaside limbs and ardent tongue”. “True” might have had the distinction of being the first UK Number One single to reference Vladimir Nabokov, had it not been for The Police’s “Don’t Stand So Close to Me” three years earlier. There, Sting had evoked the relationship between a teacher and a schoolgirl with an allusion to the same book that would later inspire Kemp:
It’s no use, he sees her / He starts to shake and cough / Just like the old man in / That book by Nabokov
The year after “True”, Duran Duran, whom the music press liked to portray as Spandau Ballet’s sworn rivals, had a hit with “The Wild Boys”. If Spandau Ballet had smuggled a liking for scandalous reading matter into “True”, Duran Duran exceeded them by basing a song on a novel from 1971 by William S. Burroughs. The Wild Boys: A book of the dead is Burroughs’s fantasy of a band of adolescent males crossing a ruined North America in a riot of fighting and homosexual sex. Simon le Bon’s lyrics don’t appear to mention the second of those activities – the teenage girls who made up the largest part of Duran Duran’s audience might have been put off (or, perhaps, made over-excited) – but a literary source had once again found its way on to mainstream radio.
Just as much as synthesizers, hairspray and record sleeves in the Russian abstract style, a major marker of the pop of the early 1980s and late 1970s, particularly British pop, was bookishness. If literary influences weren’t always worked subtly, or even meaningfully, into the lyrics of the era, they at least indicated an intellectual curiosity and ambition on the part of their authors, not many of whom, it is worth noting, were university graduates.
This habit of advertising in song the contents of one’s bookshelves suggested, too, that being widely read might even have a distinct glamour about it. To anyone studying the downloads charts today – where you will search in vain for echoes of the English Renaissance stage or the Penguin Classics backlist – this idea will probably seem quite bizarre. One of those non-graduates with an impressive personal library was Ian Curtis, the singer and lyricist for Joy Division. Several years before Duran Duran took William S. Burroughs into the charts, the novelist had supplied Curtis with a well of potently diseased imagery, and perhaps a degree of highbrow ballast too.
“Interzone”, from Joy Division’s 1979 album Unknown Pleasures, borrows its title from the hellish country in which much of Naked Lunch occurs.
The song, which takes us on a walk “through the city limits” in the company of an existentially damaged narrator, is not as vivid on the page as Burroughs’s prose. Yet, listening as Curtis’s stark words drone on, drawing you into the song’s terminal space, you are witness to a songwriter introducing pop to regions where only difficult literature had gone before. Other Joy Division song titles – “Dead Souls”, “Atrocity Exhibition” – further show the band’s interest in making records that blur into the reading lists.
At the same time that Curtis was inventing a Gogolian and Ballardian music, in the same city of Manchester, the singer Morrissey was taking care of his own education, having left school at sixteen.
“Oh, there’s more to life than books, you know”, he sang on the Smiths’ 1983 track “Handsome Devil”, “but not much more.” Throughout Morrissey’s career – as he has quoted Wilde and referenced Woolf – the sincerity of this statement has never been in doubt. If the opening of 1985’s “How Soon is Now?” immediately lodges itself in the memory – “I am the son / And the heir / Of a shyness that is criminally vulgar / I am the son and heir / Of nothing in particular” – it is partly due to George Eliot.
“To be born the son of a Middlemarch manufacturer, and inevitable heir to nothing in particular”, wrote Eliot of the dissolute Oxford dropout Fred Vincy in her novel. Morrissey may be drawing a parallel between himself and socially climbing Fred, but it seems more likely that he just enjoyed the sound of the phrase and the exaltedness of the source. There has always been the sense that, for Morrissey, literature provided not only verbal inspiration but a form of class escape.
Though pop had nodded before towards books – Poe and Burroughs appeared on the cover of Sergeant Pepper, Led Zeppelin made fair use of J. R. R. Tolkien, and of course there was Bob Dylan – by the 1980s the references were coming more thickly, and they showed increasing literary discernment. Kate Bush became famous in 1978 with a hummable précis of Emily Brontë and ended the 1980s with “The Sensual World”, a song that adapts Molly Bloom’s closing monologue in Ulysses. Scritti Politti, who took their name from Antonio Gramsci, released a single titled “Jacques Derrida” (“I’m in love with Jacques Derrida / Read a page and know what I need to”). The Cure’s early song “Killing An Arab” is based on an episode in Camus’s L’Étranger and their track “How Beautiful You Are” is a rewriting of a Baudelaire poem. In 1988, the Sisters of Mercy made the Top 20 with a song, “Dominion”, that quoted both Shelley’s “Ozymandias” and T. S. Eliot’s “Gerontion”. For a few years, it seemed, you weren’t authentically rock and roll unless you were also conspicuously well read.
Why this ever happened, and why it no longer appears to be the case, is one for the sociologists as well as the pop historians. Many of the stars of the 1980s were first picking up their instruments around the time of the early punk rock releases. Punk, branded by the Sex Pistols’ manager Malcolm McClaren and their sleeve artist Jamie Reed with the apothegms of the Situationist International, always had a smack of learnedness about it: if you wanted really to grasp the Pistols and the others, you were required to do a little background reading. No future, perhaps, except in the public library. Few are the 1980s musicians, too, who wouldn’t cite David Bowie, avid self-educator, as a model. Educational conservatives might point to the fact that many band members of the era came of age before the end of selection in UK state secondary schools; it is tempting to invoke the figure of the grammar school boy with his grounding in Latin and his several poems learned by heart (though Morrissey, for one, failed his 11-plus exam).
It also shouldn’t be forgotten that literate pop is still being made. Radiohead have taken repeatedly from J. G. Ballard since the 1990s (one of their songs is called “Airbag”); in 2007, Klaxons scraped the Top 40 with the single “Gravity’s Rainbow” (though the lyrics didn’t greatly enhance any reading of Thomas Pynchon’s novel); and P. J. Harvey, when promoting her 2011 album Let England Shake, made much of the influence on the record of Harold Pinter and T. S. Eliot. But these are occasional activities largely on pop’s settled, adult-orientated fringes.
The noisiest and most ubiquitous songs of the moment are no longer scattered with allusions to books and writers. If you believe that popular music is at its best when it channels ideas and fantasies from outside its own confines – even risking accusations of pretentiousness in the process – this has to be considered a loss.
