Hearthwarming!

We had Brangelina from Hollywood and we have Saifeena from Bollywood. Meet Dilzanne from Sri Lanka! Former supermodel and Miss Sri Lanka for Miss Universe 2005 Rozanne Diasz Leanage and her husband Dilruk Leanage dubbed themselves with this portmanteau when they tied the knot in 2010. She is a fashionista and he is a businessman but their life flowed smoothly despite being engaged in two different spheres. Rozanne’s doting husband Dilruk tells us that it is being at home and close to her family that really makes his wife tick.
Rozanne in a few words
She is a very energetic, loving, and a beautiful wife.
Greatest strength
Our children are her greatest strength. We have two children: Raeanne who is 10 years and Zach who is five years. She simply dotes on them and manages everything well.
An alternative profession for Rozanne
She would have made a good sportswoman. She has played basketball for the national team so I believe that she could have gone far in that sector.
She is ‘the one’
We met in church so I believe that it is a match made by God. It is difficult to describe my first impression about her… She was different from anyone I met in my life. I realized this difference the first time I laid eyes on her. We began going out and I got to know what a beautiful person she is on the inside. This made me fall for her and choose her as my life partner.
Romance
Though we have been married for nearly seven years and are busy parents we make time for the two of us whenever we can. We go out for dinner once in a while. However we do not stay out very late because she is perticular about getting to the children’s side soon.
I was not a responsible person before marriage. I was carefree and adjusting to a family life was not easy for me. Every experience was new for me and even when she was pregnant I was waiting to see the child’s face without knowing what kind of duties I have to take on as a father. Our daughter was born early morning. The greatest gift that Rozanne has given me is our two children. Now that we have a son and daughter we feel like our family is complete.
The family person
Rozanne is wonderful with the kids. Family comes first for her no matter what. That is why she loves staying at home. She manages all the children’s activities and is a very dedicated mother. She cuts back her work a bit even and tends to give more of herself to the family. She is also close to my parents and gets along with them wonderfully.
The public figure
Since Rozanne is a celebrity people walk up to her and talk to her wherever we go. I am use to that now. I don’t mind it when they walk up to say ‘Hi’ or pose for a picture with her.
Free time
Rozanne is very much a home bird. Any free time she gets, she enjoys staying at home. She loves being around the kids and me when we all get some free time. Our schedules are normally hectic during the school days when the kids have to go to school and there are classes to take part in during weekends. I drop them off at St Bridget’s and The British School in the morning on my way to work and she picks them up later and takes them for classes. So any free time we get we try to spend it at home doing nothing in particular. It is just a day of togetherness spent at home.
Holidaying
We go out of Colombo when we get a holiday. We love to explore the country so we visit different places rather than have one or two favourite holiday destinations. We go to foreign countries for vacations as well. We have been to Singapore, Malaysia and Bali so far. We visit India regularly because I have some good friends over there.
Foodwise
We have a maid to do the cooking but Rozanne whips up a dish now and then. I love the dhal curry she makes. She makes a delicious pol sambol too. Attending functions is a part of our lifestyle so we eat at such places. Sometimes we eat out. We are adventurous in that sense because we love tasting different kinds of food. We might go to an expensive hotel on one occasion and a small eatery the next time.
One thing Rozanne dislikes about Dilruk
She does not like it when I have to go out late in the night.
Irritations
When I lose my cool it irritates her a bit. She is also quick tempered but cools down fast. When we get angry – we really get angry! However within two hours everything has cooled off. We do not discuss matters which we disagree on in front of the kids. What generally happens after we have had a bad argument is that I go off somewhere to be by myself. We talk it over during the night and the next day it is as if the argument has not taken place! We do not harbor any grudges.
Shared passion
Food! We are both gastronomic adventurers when it comes to tasting new types of food. Rozanne is a fan of Japanese food. I also love Japanese dishes so we have no problem picking out what kind of cuisine we want to visit. We do not have a favourite dish but we like things like salmon dishes made the Japanese way. Believe it or not, I was not into seafood – especially fish - before marriage but my taste changed after spending a few months with her.
We go to the gym and go for morning walks to maintain our figures. Though we are both foodies we follow a healthy lifestyle and food choices. We try to eat less towards night time. Rozanne loves chocolates. She simply has to have them. I eat chocolates too but do not crave for them like her.
Poles apart
We differ from what we engage in. She does her fashion related work and I let her handle those things without getting involved. Likewise she does not meddle with my business affairs. However we are supportive towards each other’s professional goals just by being there, standing by each other’s side.
Habitswise Rozanne likes to read books – autobiographies and biographies of well known figures in particular. I am not a bookworm. I leave her to it and watch TV instead.
One change…
Rozanne is a workaholic. She hardly takes a break when she is on the go. If it was up to me I would see that she does less so that she does not tire herself too much.
Rozanne is particular about…
Neatness. Everything has to be in order for her. She is concerned about tidiness too. This is difficult with the children because they are still very young. They might do as she instructs them then but leave stuff around later. Rozanne also encourages the children towards studies expecting the best possible grades from them.
The unkonown side of Rozanne
Rozanne is pretty much an open book so there is nothing much that is unknown about her. Many people think that she might be proud but she is a very down to earth person. You have to meet and speak to her to realize this.
The public has this conception that models and beauty queens are so full of themselves and how they look that they do not dedicate themselves to their families. This does not go with Rozanne because she is very much a family person.
