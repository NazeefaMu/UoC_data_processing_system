Parcels, personal goods
Cabinet Secretary warns against racketeer

Secretary to the Cabinet of Ministers Sumith Abeysinghe said no relief has been granted for Customs duties and taxes for shipping personal goods and international parcels.
The Office of the Cabinet of Ministers recently received some information about a racketeer who makes money claiming that the government has granted relief for shipping international parcels and personal goods and he could assist with the process.
This racketeer has provided fake letters using the letterhead of the Office of the Cabinet of Ministers. The Secretary urged the public not to be misled by these fake letters.
The Officer of the Cabinet of Ministers has already informed the IGP to conduct an investigation in this regard and take legal action against the culprit.
If any person wishes to check the accuracy of a letter sent under the letterhead of the Office of Cabinet of Ministers, they can do so by calling 0112 329620 or 0112 525279 or sending an email to [email protected].
