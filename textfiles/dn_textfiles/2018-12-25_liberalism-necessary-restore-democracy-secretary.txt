Thirty-second annual congress of the Liberal Party
Liberalism is necessary to restore democracy- Secretary

Liberal Party Secretary Attorney Kamal Nissanka said that the Liberal Party does not have any memorandum of understanding with any major political party.
He was addressing their party members at the 32nd annual congress which was held at the Kurunegala Bishop Laksman Wikramasinghe Hall last Friday (21).
‘People of this country have a right to know what the government is doing. During the last parliamentary election, the government gave many promises about upholding human rights, but none of them were fulfilled. The Sri Lanka Liberal Party has a good and a massive vision. Liberalism is a factor which is necessary to restore democracy in the country through protection of human rights.’ he added.
Further he stated that the Liberal Party supported the political campaign of President Maithripala Sirisena during the last presidential election. The Secretary said that the President appoints top-post officials who are loyal to him and to the government without taking action against corruption cases which have been revealed during his reign.
The Government has failed to fulfill their tasks as they mentioned in the hundred-day programme, he added.
Chairman of the Liberal Party Anura Samarajeewa, Deputy Chairman Kethum Samaratunga, Deputy Secretary Sarath Kumarasinghe and some party members were present at the event.
