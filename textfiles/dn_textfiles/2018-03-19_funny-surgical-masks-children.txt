Funny surgical masks for children

Beyond the illness, the hospital may be a traumatic experience. To help children playing down these difficult situations, designer Jyo John Mulloor has created ‘The Care Mask’, a series of funny surgical masks that turn doctors, surgeons, parents and kids into offbeat characters and animals! This is an excellent project that seeks to break the cold and sterile appearance of the hospital, to help children better live their hospitalization. For the moment these masks are only a concept, but the idea is brilliant. Metro
