More advanced naturalists will learn key identification points for the more difficult species. For easy comparison, similar species are grouped together within each family.
The soft cover paperback is easy to carry and its linen embossed cover and its water-resistance should help withstand moderate field handling. In this 250-page paperback, all 248-species found in the island are illustrated with images of live individuals in the field and are described with key information on appearance, behavior, habitat, flight period and prime locations for observing them. Distribution maps show current and historical records.
Identification of similar species is made easier with additional identification keys, images and helpful hints.
A brief description of typical butterfly habitats in each zone is also included. There is no doubt that this field guide will prove to be the indispensable reference for years to come. For more details: www.lepodonbooks.com
