Rs 1 bn allocated for mega convention centre - Minister

The Sri Lanka Tourism Ministry has a Rs 1 billion deposit allocated to build a mega convention centre, said Minister of Tourism John Amaratunge. “However this was not utilised and has gone back to the Treasury again.”
Speaking to ‘Daily News Business’, he said that Sri Lanka urgently needed a large conference facility to accommodate a large number of stalls. “BMICH is not adequate to host larger events and due to this Sri Lanka is losing out on the MICE segment.”
The Minister said that they have identified an area within the BMICH to build a conference facility. “I have written to former President Chandrika Kumaratunga in this regard and am awaiting her response,” he said.
The Minister said that they will invest the Rs 1 billion that is allocated for the project and added that they would look for foreign funding for the balance financial requirement. Asked if any foreigners were affected due to the dengue epidemic he answered in the negative.
“Yes, there were a few cancellations and some adverse travel advisories. But arrivals are once again picking up and we are confident that the industry can reach the US$ 3.5 billion revenue target and 2.5 million arrivals by 2017 end.”
