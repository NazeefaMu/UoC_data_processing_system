Sweet moments from Mandy and Taylor’s wedding

Romance is in the air whenever these two are around! Over a year after Mandy Moore and Taylor Goldsmith got engaged, the two lovebirds were married in an intimate backyard ceremony.
‘The This Is Us’ star’s close friend and makeup artist Jenn Streicher shared a series of images from the happy day - including some of Moore’s unconventional pink Rodarte wedding gown and veil.
“Yesterday was pretty magical. I laughed, I cried and I danced real hard. @mandymooremm @taylordawesgoldsmith,” she captioned the post, which has since been deleted.
The intimate nuptials took place in the backyard of the couple’s home in Los Angeles at sundown in front of family and close friends.
