Enforced Disappearance Bill to be debated on March 7

The draft bill for protection against enforced disappearances which was postponed twice in Parliament has been re-scheduled for debate on March 7.
The Government presented the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance Bill in Parliament on March 7, 2017. The Bill was scheduled to be taken up for debate on July 5 and September 19 last year, but the Government had to defer it due to objections of various groups.
The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka wrote to President Maithripala Sirisena urging him to give leadership to enact the proposed bill. The HRC letter signed by its Chairperson Dr. Deepika Udagama observed that this legislation is a positive step towards addressing the long history of disappearances in Sri Lanka and stemming impunity for human rights violations
The Joint Opposition raised objections to the bill stating that it poses a threat to the security forces.However, the Government clarified that the Bill is not retrospective and its main intention is to ensure that every Sri Lankan citizen gets the freedom to live without fear of being a victim of enforced disappearance or abduction.
