Lanka hope to take on England with fearless approach : Thirimanne doubtful starter for first Test

 
 
On paper Sri Lanka looks like a Test team of no-hopers for their tour of England which begins at the end of the week with a three-day game against Essex at Chelmsford. That is because the side lacks the experience that is required to survive under early English conditions.
However skipper Angelo Mathews feels that what they lack by way of experience his young side can overcome by their fearless approach with which they are capable of playing their cricket.
“When you have a young and inexperienced side you have nothing to lose but go out there and perform, that’s what the team will do. The key is their
fearless attitude to take up the challenge and deliver,” said Mathews whose team will embark to England tomorrow.
“We came close to beating New Zealand twice and we won the Test series against West Indies. This team has the potential to perform and win. The two warm-up games will be crucial for us to acclimatize ourselves to the conditions we are going to come up against. We are going into two extremes of temperatures from the high we have been experiencing at home to almost freezing point in England. The need to adjust very quickly to the changes is the key. If we can do that we can overcome a major hurdle,” he said.
Sri Lanka will take on England in a series of three Tests starting with the first at Headingley, Leeds on May 19. It is a venue that will evoke fond memories for Mathews and eight others in the present squad when they turned tables on England with a last gasp win by 100 runs. That victory gave Sri Lanka the series 1-0 and it was the first time they achieved that milestone in their history.
Mathews had a memorable series scoring a hundred in his first appearance at Lord’s, a Test that Sri Lanka escaped with a draw with their last pair at the wicket. He followed it up with a monumental 160 at Leeds, an innings that laid the foundation for that historic win.
Mathews achieved both Test career best performances in that series with the bat (160) and with the ball (4/44).
“It was my first tour of England and I managed to adjust to the conditions and come out on top. I expect the same with the present crop of players most of whom are alien to English conditions,” said Mathews.
“I am quite confident we can achieve the same result this time around. I know that we are a bit on the inexperienced side without the likes of Sanga (Kumar Sangakkara) and Mahela (Jayawardene) but I won’t say that batting is the weak point maybe in experience, yes. This team is prepared to take on anyone with their fearless approach.”
Mathews said that he would not put too much pressure on himself as captain. “There is always pressure when you play. I wouldn’t let captaincy affect my batting or bowling.”
Mathews with 58 Test caps and left-arm spinner Rangana Herath with 67 are the only players in the team who have made over 50 Test appearances for their country. Dimuth Karunaratne, Kaushal Silva, Lahiru Thirimanne, Dinesh Chandimal, Dhammika Prasad, Shaminda Eranga, Nuwan Pradeep and Dilruwan Perera along with Mathews and Herath were members of the 2014 Test side that toured England.
The two warm-up games (against Essex and Leicestershire ahead of the Test series) Mathews said will be used to fill a few slots in the batting order.
“We will try to play a fixed side and make sure the players are given permanent positions,” said Mathews. “But at this point of time Dimuth (Karunaratne) and Kaushal (Silva) will be our openers and the number three spot will be occupied by either Kusal Mendis who is shaping up well or Niroshan Dickwella.
“Lahiru (Thirimanne) is recovering from a hamstring injury which he first picked up in New Zealand and if he is fit he will play in the first Test. We need his experience in the batting.”
Thirimanne is battling with a personal problem to come to terms with his cricket and at the moment is going through a lean period with his bat. Mathews was confident that he will come good during the England tour.
“Preparations for the tour have been good I am very happy the way we have gone about it,” said Mathews. “We left a lot of grass on the pitches we practiced and we started practices very early in the morning so that the bowlers were able to get some swing on the ball especially up in Pallekele.”
