N. R. J. Aaron: Man with a golden heart
It was in the early 1980s, when I joined the Daily News as a sub editor, that I met N. R. J. Aaron. During my stint at the Sun, where I was freelancing as an undergraduate at the Sri Jayawardenapura University, I had heard of him, but this was the first time that I was seeing him in person.
I expected to see a burly authoritative person, instead it was a small made man with a wide grin who greeted me. His smile made me most welcome and I was already feeling at home.
Although I was not directly under him, when handling local pages, especially in the nights, we used to have contact him as he used to hand over the local news copies, which in those days were either hand written or typed.
He used to come to office around 10 am and leave around 9.30 pm. When we came to office around 4.00 pm for the night shift he had already gathered the news and would have them over to us. He was a man who believed in deadlines and he expected this from everyone.
Aaron never demanded how the sub editor should go about the layout, but if he wanted something given prominence, he would simply come to you and tell; “Riza can you please box that story”. He never needed to do so, instead could have ordered us to do so. The word 'please' was widely used by him, which I think was why he gained the respect of all the subs.
Years after he left, I remember him calling me at the Daily News and congratulating me. How he knew I had got a promotion remains a mystery till today, as he never divulged who told him. Just two weeks before I left the Daily News, Aaron called me and inquired about the paper. He also spoke about Malcolm Viduranpillai, who was the head of the VDT Department, and had passed away a couple of weeks ago.
Aaron was very happy that the Daily News was doing well and said he read the paper daily. He spoke about the past and said he was very happy to see most of the juniors doing well. I remember him mentioning P. Balasingham, who retired from the Daily News, Dr. Ranga Kalansooriya, present Director General of the Government Information, Rodney Martinez, Senior Associate Editor of the Daily News, Pramod de Silva, Consultant Editor of the Sunday Observer and Dudley Jansz, senior journalist, who also retired from the Sunday Observer.
Listening to him made me feel that he missed the good old days spent in the Daily News Editorial. He must have missed walking along the corridors, chit chatting while sipping tea brought from the canteen, browsing through the papers in the library.
It is rarely we come across people like Aaron. He never ran you down, always had a good word about everyone and never back stabbed. If he did not like something. he would confront you and the matter was settled.
We have lost a dedicated journalist, but moreover a man with a golden heart.
