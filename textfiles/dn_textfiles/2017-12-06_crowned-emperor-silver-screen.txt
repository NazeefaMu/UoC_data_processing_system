Prior to legendary Gamini Fonseka’s emergence into the Sinhala cinema, our industry was struggling as it was totally dependent on the umbilical string of the South Indian cinema when it was plunged into their ditch. The legend was chiefly instrumental in changing the infancy status of our film industry which was in the immaturity stage for decades. Of course the South Indian films made with high technology were of course impressive and to break that trend and hoodoo was his desire which he to a great degree succeeded by acting, directing, editing mostly his own creations which was hitherto then was attempting and overwhelmed to position up on its own.

Gamini was a genius and hero in both commercial and artistic films which was comprehensively proved by his portraying in his roles in “Gamperaliya” and “Nidhanaya” the characters of Jinadasa in the former and as Willie Abeynayake in “Sandeshaya”..
It was like a natural phenomenon for films in which Gamini Fonseka portrayed lead role to make box office records by running continuously for 100 days on film circuits.

Gamini Fonseka was a man who established dignity to every sphere that he was implicated in.

He left a legacy to pursue and not to facsimile. In this aspect anyone who attempts to copy Gamini Fonseka would be unsuccessful.
Gamini’s mentor Lester James Peiris had forecasted that another Gamini Fonseka will not be born in this country for the next one thousand years. Accordingly to him, the gigantic void created by Gamini’s death in 2004 will not be filled for the next one thousand years. Gamini Fonseka was a larger-than-life figure in every way. Physically he had a superior heart than of a standard human being and that could have been a reason for his sturdy temperament power and influence.
