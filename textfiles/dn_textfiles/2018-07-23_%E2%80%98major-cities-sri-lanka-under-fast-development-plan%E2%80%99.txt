‘Major cities in Sri Lanka under fast development plan’

The Word Bank, Asian Development Bank and several other donor organizations will fund infrastructural development schemes in 13 major cities in the country. The French Development Program provides 10 BN for the Anuradhapura Integrated City Development Project which is to commence in 2019, Megapolis and Western Province Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
He was addressing the gathering at the second awareness programme, ‘’Mega minds towards the future we dream,’’ for professionals. The first programme was held recently in Kandy.
The Minister said China built the Great Wall, but it would not surpass our ancient irrigation system. “Anuradhapura has been the only city, which exists for nearly 1,400 years,” the Minister said.
The French funded Anuradhapura Integrated City Development Programme will revive the lost glory and prosperity in Anuradhapura. “A storm water management system will be built and tourism industry will be improved. Traffic congestion in the city will be lessened and historic monuments will be preserved,” the Minister said.
The Minister said per capita income of South Korea in 1960 was similar to that of Sri Lanka. “Today they have increased theirs tenfold higher than ours. Our youths are in queues to get jobs in Korea. Over 40,000 Sri Lankans are now working in Korea,” the Minister said..
He said we are proud of having a 2,500 years old history. “But boasting about it would not bring in prosperity. Small countries such as the Netherlands, Spain and Britain conquered us and we slaved once for them. Now is the most appropriate time for us to rise up to compete with other nations to achieve our future goals. We are blessed with our internationally praised national health service and the education system,” the Minister said.
The Minister said Sri Lanka is not an isolated country now. “Our CO2 emission is very low compared to its international levels. We must study Bangladesh, India, Pakistan before joining the global economic competition. Sri Lanka is in the centre of the Indian Ocean and that helps us emerging as a hub of trade and tourism in the region,’” the Minister said.
The Minister said Sri Lanka could be the regional leader in navigation and air travel. “Trincomale could be the way to China, Far east, Bangladesh, Mumbai, Myanmar, Thailand, and the Middle East while the Colombo Port for the Middle East, Western Countries, Central Asia and African countries. “We have to study these avenues. By 2023, Colombo will not have shanties.
Under the proposed town planning system, more employment opportunities would be available. A safe and peaceful environment and better standards of life would be ensured,” the Minister said.
