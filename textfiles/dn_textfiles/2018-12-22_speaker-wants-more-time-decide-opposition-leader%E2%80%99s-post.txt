Speaker wants more time to decide on Opposition Leader’s post

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya requested more time to give his final ruling on the post of Opposition Leader of Parliament.
The Speaker’s ruling is due as both former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and TNA Leader R.Sampanthan are claiming the the Opposition Leader post.
The Speaker making a special announcement in Parliament yesterday said that he requires more time to study the matter in depth.
“I received a motion signed by several MPs asking to appoint a Parliament Select Committee on this matter. I also received a letter signed by UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera on the party membership of the former President.
Then I also got another letter by TNA MP M.A.Sumanthiran. I will study all these letters and communicate my decision as soon as possible,” the Speaker said.
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella and TNA MP Sumanthiran contended that former President Rajapaksa and his fellow MPs ceased to be Members of Parliament as one month has lapsed since having left the SLFP and obtained Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) membership. Sumanthiran also questioned as to whether it is correct to give the Opposition Leader post to a Member of Parliament belonging to the same party of the President, who is the Head of Government, Head of Executive and Head of Cabinet and currently holding three Cabinet portfolios. The UPFA MPs supporting Rajapaksa denied having SLPP membership.
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa assumed the seat allocated to the Opposition Leader in Parliament yesterday while Sampanthan assumed a front row seat near the main entrance.
