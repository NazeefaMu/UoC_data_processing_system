Prelates want Big Matches banned

Annual School Big Matches should be banned for the well-being of youngsters, several Chief Buddhist Prelates declared yesterday. Southern Province Chief Sangha Nayake of the Sri Lanka Ramanna Chapter Ven. Omalpe Sobhitha Thera said big matches were acting as a platform to promote alcohol and violence among schoolchildren and the government should at least consider a temporary ban until a solution is found to overcome the issues.
Speaking at a media briefing at the Government Information Department, Ven. Sobhitha Thera said the Defence Ministry should move in to halt the annual big match between Ananda College and Nalanda College if the principals take no action to stop the match, given the recent violent clashes between the students of the two schools.
He said: “Big matches have to be held within a legal framework. Consumption of liquor and other drugs have to be banned within the premises where big matches are held. Members of Old Boys’ Associations have to be mindful to cater to the betterment of the future generations. Otherwise, they will be considered as ‘Old Beasts’ who contribute to the destruction of the young generation. Principals also have to take responsibility to educate students to behave according to their school anthems.”
Ven. Sobhitha Thera added that the Police should take legal action against offenders. The Yahapalanaya Government has to establish harmony and good governance, and eliminate tense situations, he added.
Siyam Chapter Chief Prelate Most Ven. Ittapana Dhammalankara Mahanayaka Thera said: “Big matches provide a platform for the promotion of liquor and other drugs. Therefore, big matches contribute to the exposure of students to these harmful habits. This is destructive to the whole nation.”
Ven. Vajirarama Gnanaseeha Thera said principals should implement a rigorous code of ethics to create a strong ethical framework within schools.
Ven. Kuppiyawatte Bodhananda Thera said a sport is meant to create a better individual and not to lead society towards destruction.
Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media State Minister Karunarathna Paranawithana said ‘Mathin Thora Ratak’ programme would be conducted island wide to create a country free of alcohol and drugs under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena.
