JO slams decision to remove Janaka Bandara Tennekoon as Dambulla party organizer

The Joint Opposition yesterday, slammed the decision taken by the SLFP to remove Janaka Bandara Tennekoon as the Party’s organizer for the Dambulla electorate.
MP Dullas Alahapperuma speaking to the media in Colombo, said that Tennekoon as a senior Vice President of the SLFP had done yeomen service to the Party’s progress over the years.
Alahapperuma while noting that the removal of party stalwarts such as Tennekoon, would hurt the SLFP in the long run as compared to the
incident where the sacking of the
SLFP and UPFA General Secretaries 72 hours prior to the August 18 General election.
Alahapperuma also charged that those who had replaced Tennekoon and several other SLFP seniors removed in recent times as electoral organizers, were incompetent and unpopular.
He went on to say that sacking of party seniors from posts of electoral organizers, would help to bring in more crowds to the JO’s May Day rally at Galle Face.
