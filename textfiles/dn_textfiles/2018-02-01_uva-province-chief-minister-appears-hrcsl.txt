Uva Province Chief Minister appears before HRCSL

 
Uva Province Chief Minister Chamara Sampath Dassanayaka, who is alleged to have forced a female school Principal to kneel before him, appeared before the Sri Lanka Human rights Commission (HRCSL) a short while ago.
The HRCSL notified the alleged Chief Minister to appear before the commission, last Monday.
The Chief Minister forced the Badulla Tamil Maha Vidyalaya Principal to kneel before him, for not accepting a letter given by him for the admission of a student to that school.
