Helmet for motorcycle, pillion rider made compulsory

A Gazette notification was issued on Thursday which stipulates that a motorcycle and pillion rider must wear a helmet that conforms to the new guidelines.
The helmet, according to the notification, must properly and securely fit the wearer’s head, have a chin strap and clear visor that does not obstruct the rider’s peripheral vision or obscure his or her face.
The helmet must also not have any sharp edges or points, and must be 90% a single color. Furthermore, it must be easily visible. The notification also states that nobody is allowed to sell a helmet that does not conform to the new regulations.
