Confidence confirmed

After months of speculation and procrastination, Parliament last night debated and put to the vote a motion of no-confidence against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, in what was only the country’s third vote of no-confidence moved against a sitting Prime Minister.
The no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Wickremesinghe was defeated last night following a stormy and often heated 12-hour debate. It was history repeating itself: the two previous motions of no confidence against Prime Ministers S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike and Sirima Bandaranaike were also defeated. This is, therefore, an opportune moment to place in context yesterday’s events in relation to the seismic shifts if politics that have taken place over the past three years.
The January 8, 2015, presidential Election swept President Maithripala Sirisena into power, ironically not with the support of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) of which he was a member for forty years and general secretary for fourteen years. It was the SLFP’s arch-rival, the United National Party (UNP) which propelled President Sirisena to power, an exercise in which only a handful of SLFPers supported him.
Following his election victory, President Sirisena returned the favour to some extent: he called upon the UNP to form a minority government where UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe was appointed Prime Minister. That government lasted until the general elections which were held in August 2015.
Key political developments
In that intervening period between January and August 2015, several key political developments took place. The 19th Amendment to the Constitution, now the cynosure of all eyes, was introduced and passed in Parliament. In doing so, President Sirisena reached out and obtained the support of his party, the SLFP, as the amendment required a two-thirds majority to ensure its passage through Parliament.
It was also during this period that President Sirisena sought and obtained the leadership of the SLFP, the party he was banished from when he contested the presidential election. This was by virtue of a clause introduced by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa into the SLFP Constitution which stated that if the country’s President was a SLFPer, he would automatically become party leader as well.
Even though President Sirisena had re-entered the SLFP, the lead up to the 2015 general election exposed the rifts within the party. It became evident that the majority of SLFP candidates and sitting MPs were still loyal to Rajapaksa, even though executive power now rested with President Sirisena. In an unprecedented step, President Sirisena made an address to the nation declaring that even if the SLFP won the election, Rajapaksa would not be made Prime Minister.
The outcome of the general election was to shape events to come and was a key factor in yesterday’s vote in Parliament: the UNP emerged as the single largest party. However, with only 106 seats, it failed to win a simple majority. The SLFP emerged a strong second, with 95 seats. The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) won 16 seats while the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) won 6 seats.
Joint Opposition
With an eye on introducing more constitutional amendments- particularly those that would address the ethnic question, reform the process of elections and dilute if not abolish the Executive Presidency- President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe decided to form a government of national unity that would ensure that the government retained a two-thirds majority in Parliament enabling it to make constitutional changes.
In doing so, President Sirisena found that he had the support of only about 44 parliamentarians. The other 51 remained loyal to Rajapaksa. Not only were they dissenting, they also took their campaign to the public, launching a series of protest rallies that were as a much a protest against the President as much as it was against the UNP. In Parliament, they banded themselves as the so-called ‘Joint Opposition’ (JO).
Since then, the JO has been relentless in its campaigns against the government. As a result, some SLFP ministers, wary about their electoral prospects and survival at the next elections, often sided with the JO, opposing key policy issues mooted by the UNP faction of the government. Others, such as Susil Premajayantha and Dayasiri Jayasekera, were openly critical of UNP-led policies in general and of the UNP leadership in particular. The UNP was, however, keen to pursue its own liberal, reformist agenda.
When news of the bond sale issue at the Central Bank broke, President Sirisena probably sensed an opportunity there. That would explain why he chose to appoint a Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the issue when no such commissions were appointed to inquire into the alleged misdeeds of the previous regime.
It is an understatement to say that the UNP did not cover itself in glory at the Presidential Commission. Even the resignation of former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake had to be virtually extracted- and to this day, Karunanayake protests his innocence, despite the findings that have come to light at the Commission.
That- and the indecision in acting against Karunanayake- was a crucial blunder by the UNP leadership. Indeed, that was the thrust of the motion of no-confidence against Prime Minister Wickremesinghe yesterday.
From that point onwards, the JO was waiting for the opportune moment to pounce. On the ground, it had formed the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) because the SLFP remained under the control of President Sirisena and he made it clear he had no intention of letting go of those reins.
With the JO within Parliament and the SLPP outside it, Rajapaksa was gearing for a comeback- and the local government elections last February provided the new party with the ideal opportunity to test the political waters.
The SLPP emerged a clear winner at the election and the UNP came a somewhat distant second. The big loser was the mainstream SLFP headed by President Sirisena.
Therefore, it was no longer expedient for the President to unite with the dissident Rajapaksa faction of the SLFP, it became imperative.
So, when the JO came up with the motion of no-confidence, President Sirisena was hamstrung by the electoral incompetence of his own party- and had no choice but to support it, if not actively, at least tacitly.
Yesterday’s vote
The composition of the current Parliament was critical in yesterday’s vote. In the end, the motion was never going to succeed without the support of a section of the UNP endorsing it or abstaining from voting. With Prime Minister Wickremesinghe being at the helm of the UNP for twenty-four years, there was bound to be some dissension within the ranks- and this is what the JO planned to capitalise on.
Despite yesterday’s events, most UNP parliamentarians felt betrayed by President Sirisena, the man they helped into high office. However, it must come to terms with the fact that President Sirisena will be in office for the next two years. It must also take to heart the stinging rebuke it has received from the voters at the local government elections and now looks towards the next general and presidential elections. Campaigning for the latter is due in one and a half years.
With the vote concluding late last night, at the time of writing it is too early to say what the overall political fallout will be. What is clear though is that the tumultuous relationship between the UNP and the SLFP within the national government will never be the same again and that raises the question as to what shape and form the government would now take.
Despite the outcome of yesterday’s vote finally being determined, key questions remain: will the UNP succeed in reforming the party without further delay? Will the two factions of the SLFP now unite and present a common front at the next elections? And, given yesterday’s outcome, what are President Sirisena’s options?
These are the questions that the nation awaits answers to. They cannot come soon enough as party politics have become an interesting but costly diversion for the masses who want their politicians to get back to the business of running the country instead of bickering among themselves for the spoils of power.
