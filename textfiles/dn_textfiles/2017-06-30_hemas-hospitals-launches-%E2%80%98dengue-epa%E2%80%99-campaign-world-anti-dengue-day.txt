Hemas Hospitals launches  ‘Dengue Epa’ campaign on  World Anti-Dengue Day

With dengue hot spots in Sri Lanka experiencing a four-fold increase in infection, Hemas Hospitals multi-chain calls for personal action by citizens to be fully aware of and protect their families and neighbourhoods against the spread of Dengue.
The hospital launched a digital campaign and Facebook site titled “Dengue Epa”, on world Anti-Dengue day held on June 15, focusing entirely on awareness generation and education in all three languages. ‘Dengue Epa’ Facebook posts will help teach public signs for early identification and detection of typical symptoms and of keeping surrounding areas and neighbourhoods clean and risk free of mosquito breeding, all as critical responsibility areas that all Sri Lankans should take notice of.
Dr Suneth Kumarapperuma, Consultant Community Physician, National Dengue Control Unit (NDCU) of the Ministry of Health participated at the simple launch event along with the leadership and senior members of staff of Hemas Hospitals.
Sri Lanka is currently facing a surge of the Dengue epidemic with the number of reported cases so far since the beginning of 2017 at 62,000 plus – thrice more than it was last year at the same time and the highest number recorded in Sri Lanka. Prompt treatment and action at hospitals have helped contain the fatality count; however the spread of the Dengue menace has not been controlled effectively.
Managing Director of Hemas Hospitals, Dr Lakith Peiris said that the hospital will take the dengue problem head-on. He emphasized that being pro-active is key to mitigating fatalities and noted that dengue in Sri Lanka is out of control - evident by the statistics. “As responsible citizens and socially responsible organizations, we need to ask ourselves whether we contribute enough to help eradicate dengue. Everyone needs to be alert and work with the authorities to contain the problem” he stressed. “We at Hemas Hospitals as a responsible healthcare institution feel the need to play that role” he added.
Dr Peiris said that the launch of ‘Dengue Epa’ campaign today will have the potential to reach 5.4 million facebook users in this country. I’m certain that this campaign will be very impactful to change the mindset of our people, to change their behavior and to take personal responsibility to fight this battle and also to pressurize the regulators, policymakers and administrators of Sri Lanka to be more cautious and mindful of this deadly disease.
The hospital multi-chain has geared itself to managing the growing numbers of patients. From antigen testing to closely monitoring clinical signs and preparedness in case of an escalation to dengue hemorrhagic condition, their team of qualified and experienced medical professionals is on hand and fully alert to promptly diagnose and start treatment. Digital agency, Seven Media Group will partner Hemas Hospitals and host the facebook page free of charge, as their contribution towards this effort.
