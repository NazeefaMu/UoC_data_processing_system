Celebrating Lanka, New Zealand national days together

A troupe of Sri Lankan dancers is ramping up rehearsals ahead of a Waitangi Weekend performance.
Students at the Sri Lankan Dance Academy will perform a piece celebrating New Zealand and Sri Lanka culture.
Celebrations is being held at the Little Theatre at the Dowse on February 4 which is also the Sri Lankan independence day.
"We can celebrate together," artistic director Mohan Sudusinghe said.
About 50 Sri Lankan dancers from around Wellington will perform traditional and contemporary cultural dances.
They have been practicing year round but getting back into it after the New Year break was always a challenge.
The dancers range in age from five to over 20 but dancing isn't the only entertainment in store.
"We have invited other groups - singing groups, New Zealand Friendship Society, like that – to give speeches and perform," Sudusinghe said. Maori artistes had also been invited to sing, in a concert that would blend the two cultures.
The performance was being put on with the help of Hutt City Council and volunteers from the community. Parents of the performers had really stepped up to help out.
"They give big support. Without them I couldn't do this," Sudusinghe said. Some parents were learning stage management tricks to help out with lighting and direction while others were lending a hand with costumes, finding and making accessories to go with the outfits.
Sudusinghe taught dance in Sri Lanka and ran his own dance school before moving to New Zealand in 2011. Teaching dance to children here helped keep them in touch with their cultural roots.
"I came here to give that flavour and culture to the kids." - Stuff
