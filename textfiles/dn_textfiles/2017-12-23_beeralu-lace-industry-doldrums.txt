Beeralu lace industry in doldrums

The southern region has been in the forefront of the beeralu industry in Sri Lanka since the Portuguese era. The traditional industry now faces many difficulties since it does not receive State support.
Many house wives engage in the industry complain that they do not get support of the relevant authorities to prosper their livelihood. Lack of tourist arrivals and the tsunami disaster hit the industry very bad. The rising cost of thread put it in reverse and what they produce have no proper market now, they said.
They said Sri Lankan beeralu lace has a good market in Belgium and other countries, but lack of state or private sector support make it impossible to grasp the foreign market.
