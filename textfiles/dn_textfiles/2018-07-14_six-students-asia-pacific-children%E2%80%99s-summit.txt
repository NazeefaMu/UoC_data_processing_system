Six students for Asia Pacific Children’s Summit

Six students who obtained the best result at the Grade Five Scholarship Examination last year will participate in the Asia Pacific Children’s Summit.
The 30th Asia Pacific Children’s Summit will be held in Japan from today to July 23, under the theme ‘Peace and Coexistence’. Students from 45 member countries will attend the conference.
Sri Lanka is a member country of the Asia Pacific Children’s Summit from its inception 30 years ago. Students who perform well at the Grade Five Scholarship Examination are selected to represent the country at the Summit each year. Air tickets were offered to the selected students by the Education Minister recently at the Ministry Auditorium.
