Confusion REIGNS among Lawyers

Lakshan Dias controversy:
Contradicting the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) Secretary’s letter, Convener of the Lawyers for Democracy Presidents’ Counsel J.C Weliamuna said that the BASL had not “adopted a decision” to call for an affidavit from Attorney-at-Law Lakshan Dias.
BASL President U. R Silva PC speaking to the Daily News said that it was not an order made to Dias but instead was a request.
However, the letter sent by BASL Secretary Amal Randeniya to Lakshan Dias on June 24 states “The House decided that the BASL request you to submit an affidavit with all the facts pertaining to the matter, in order to take necessary action in this regard”.
 
Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, Weliamuna said that the calling for an affidavit from Dias was a decision taken by the President of the Bar Council in his capacity as President and that such decision was not “adopted by the body”.
U.R De Silva also affirmed to the Daily News that there was no ‘decision’ taken by the body calling for the affidavit.
Weliamuna said that during the Bar Council meeting held on Saturday the June 24 four senior lawyers raised serious concerns over Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe‘s comments on Lakshan Dias and they emphasised that the Bar Council should take serious note of the Minister’s statement.
“The seniors requested the council to release a statement either condemning or to take serious note of it (the Minister’s statement). Meanwhile, some other lawyers argued in favour of the Minister. As there were differences of opinion within the Council itself, the President decided to call for an affidavit from Lakshan Dias.
The President said he will refer it to the Bar Council after the affidavit is submitted”, he said.
When questioned whether Minister Rajapakshe asked BASL to take disciplinary action against Lakshan Dias, Weliamuna refuted it by saying that it was never mentioned by the President at the meeting.
“I don’t know whether it came after the council meeting but it was never mentioned at the meeting”, he said.
The President of the Bar Association also affirmed that the Minister had not called for such action from the Body.
BASL Secretary Attorney at law Amal Randeniya said that an email was sent by the Association to Dias requesting him to submit an affidavit to the Association.
Weliamuna further said that the association should not be a political stooge of the executive or legislature. “They would have sent a letter stating that the house has adopted it, which is very wrong”, Weliamuna said.
The issue came to light after Lakshan Dias said on Television that 195 places of worship belonging to Christians had been attacked after the election of the current government.
The President, the Cardinal and the Minister of Justice and Buddha Sasana rejected the claim calling for accountability on the numbers mentioned by Dias.
The Justice Minister of also called for the derobing of Dias. Reports said that Dias had fled the country as a result of the uproar.
