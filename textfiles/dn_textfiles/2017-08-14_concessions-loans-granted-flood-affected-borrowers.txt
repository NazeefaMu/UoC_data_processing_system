Concessions on loans granted  to flood affected borrowers

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka has permitted licensed banks to grant concessions to their borrowers who have been affected by the recent floods, adverse weather conditions and connected circumstances with a view to facilitating the recommencement of their businesses and normalization of their activities.
Accordingly, licensed banks cangrant a concessionary period of up to three months in respect of repayment of all performing credit facilities of such borrowers as at May 25, 2017 and waive the penal interest for this period.
Based on the information received by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, many borrowers who have been affected by the recent floods are not aware of this concessionary scheme and therefore have not received these concessions.
Accordingly, such borrowers are informed to contact their bank branches in this regard.
