Thajudeen murder: Court seeks analytical report on video footage showing suspicious vehicle

Colombo Additional Magistrate J. Trotsky yesterday issued an order directing the University of Colombo School of Computing (UCSC) to provide an analytical report pertaining to a video footage containing a suspicious vehicle that followed former Rugby player Wasim Thajudeen’s vehicle on the night Thajudeen’s death took place.
The Additional Magistrate made this order consequent to a request made by Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Rathnayake
who appeared on behalf of the CID. The instant video footage had been obtained from a CCTV camera installed at a residence in the Colombo city. On a previous occasion, the prosecution informed Court that an individual who was inside the vehicle that followed former Rugby player Wasim Thajudeen’s car on the night of his death had been identified through the CID investigations.
DSG Rathnayake informed Court that the progress of the investigation would be submitted to Court on the next hearing date.
Meanwhile, former Western Province Senior DIG Anura Senanayake and former Narahenpita Crimes OIC Sumith Champika Perera arrested over their alleged role in the cover up of evidence in the former rugby player Wasim Thajudeen murder were yesterday ordered to be further remanded till February 2 by the Colombo Additional Magistrate.
