BOC recognizes long standing staff

Sri Lanka’s No.1 Bank with an unparalleled heritage of 78 years in the Sri Lankan Banking and finance industry, the Bank of Ceylon will recognize its long standing staff members who have enriched the legacy of the bank.
The event will take place at the BMICH on August 26 with the patronage of the Bank’s Chairman, President’s Counsel Ronald C. Perera and the General Manager D.M. Gunasekera. The members of the corporate and executive management and other bank officials will also participate in this event.
Two hundred and thirty four Staff members including a few members of the corporate and executive management who will be recognized on this day have contributed over 25 years of their life to uplift the Nation’s Banker, Bank of Ceylon, for it to continue as the No.1 Bank in the country.
These employees have served the Bank uninterrupted for over 25 years and have adhered to the regulations, maintaining the highest level of integrity and trust throughout their service.
The Bank will appreciate their noble service with a gold coin and a certificate of recognition. It is important to note that family members of these employees too have been invited to take part in this event. The Bank has recognized employees who have had long service record in previous years too.
Currently the Bank of Ceylon has over 8,000 employees serving in the local branch network, head office, in the Bank’s foreign branches and in the banking subsidiary in London. The Bank’s Human Resource Development division spearheaded this programme. “Believing employee recognition is the best motivation an employer can provide, the Bank of Ceylon’s Human Resource Development division gives special attention to every detail possible to make this event a success. Apart from employee recognizing events such as these, we ensure that we build the staff member’s professional and personal life through proper Human Resource Development mechanisms,” said Deputy General Manager Human Resource K.E.D. Sumanasiri. “The Bank has achieved a highly esteemed status in the Sri Lankan banking industry, and I’m thankful to the staff who provided a committed and dedicated service” he further added. Leading the Sri Lankan Banking industry with over 78 years experience, the Bank of Ceylon has become the most stable and the trusted bank in the country that serves Sri Lankans from all walks of life helping them to build their lives and make themselves financially stable whilst uplifting the country’s economy.
The Bank has passed exceptional milestones in recent years such as becoming the first to gain over Rs. 1.5 trillion in assets, over Rs. 1 trillion in deposits and over Rs. 1 trillion in advances. Focusing on the Banks achievement, Fitch Rating Lanka ranked the Bank of Ceylon at AA+(lka) which is the highest rating awarded to a local commercial bank and ICRA (lk) awarded AAA rating which is the highest credit quality rating issued by ICRA Lanka.
