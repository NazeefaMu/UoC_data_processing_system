‘Parliament bond debate should be scheduled before February 7’

Science, Technology and Research Minister Susil Premajayantha speaking about the Parliament debate on the bond issue said it is good if the debate is scheduled before February 7.
Addressing the media yesterday at the SLFP headquarters, he said the Elections Commission has also raised concerns as the special Parliament session falls during the period of silence. The minister agreed that it can have an impact on the elections and added that it is a matter of electoral sensitivity.
"It is good to have a Parliament debate on it. But then, people are now well aware of what happened,” he said. Minister Premajayantha further said President Maithripala Sirisena appointed the Commission to probe the bond issue but the UNP is speaking of it as if it was their plan and added that the UNP is trying to take credits for it.
He noted that the report includes recommendations to avoid similar incidents happening in the future.
