One hundred million saplings to be planted today

The next phase of the ‘Palayak Samaga Palayak’ project where 100 million saplings are scheduled to be planted across the country, will take place today to mark World Environmental Day.
In the North Central and Wayamba Provinces, plants will be distributed to all police stations, schools and religious places, as proposed by NCP Senior DIG Jagath Abeysiri Gunawardana.
An event will be held at the Mihinatale Raja Maha Viharaya today to plant the saplings, with the participation of Social Welfare and Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage and Public Administration and Management and Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara.
