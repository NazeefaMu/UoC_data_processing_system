Positive thinking is the background of modern philosophy of living a successful and happy life
Be  positive!

Being optimistic is often portrayed as a foundation for making your life full and happy. And really, these are not just words. There are several benefits in positive thinking which influence our health, confidence and relationships with other people.
If you’re not one of these positive-thinkers yet and wonder why you should try positive thinking yourself, here are some reasons for you:
1. Positive thinkers cope with stress faster and more effectively.
If an unpleasant situation happens, they concentrate on solving it rather than thinking that the things are out of their control. Actually, they are less subjected to stress as they don’t have a habit to concentrate on their negative thought.
2. Better health.
It’s proven that those who think positively live longer and feel better than those who don’t. All negative emotions reflect immediately on our body, and when we are stressed and have depressive thoughts, we face sleep problems, our muscles become tense, we become anxious and feel dissatisfied with everything. And as we get rid of the destructive thought, we also get rid of their physical result.
3. You have better relationships with people.
Positive and open people make a better first impression and usually have a lot of friends. People usually are attracted to positive persons and want to maintain a friendship with them, that’s why positive thinkers have an active social life. The same goes for romantic relationships, as such people attract more attention of the opposite sex.
4. A positive way of thought lets you be more focused and concentrated.
When you realize that the problem is not the end of the world, you learn to stay more focused when you face the problems. As a result, you can make the right decisions even in the difficult situation.
5. More confidence.
A positive way of thought learns you to be more confident. You don’t want to pretend and be someone else, you learn to love yourself and to be yourself, and it boosts your confidence.
6. Positibe thinkers are more successful in life.
Positive people tend not to concentrate on their failures and see more life opportunities. They are open to learning and trying something new. That’s why they are more successful in their careers.
7. They have a happier life.
The optimistic people usually live happier and more productive life. Remember the law of attraction – if the person thinks positive, she attracts more positive events in her life. If the person is grateful for everything she has, she will get even more of this.
So, don’t concentrate on your problems, be optimistic and your life will change in the better way!
