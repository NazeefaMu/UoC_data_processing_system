A disturbing trend

There is an ongoing disturbing trend, if not arrested in time, could develop into an anarchic situation, with grave consequences. We are here referring to the increasing incidents of intimidation of the police by unruly mobs and the unbecoming scenes at several schools, during the recent weeks, where students, together with parents, were seen staging demonstrations, destroying the atmosphere associated with a school.
Mobs surrounded the Moratuwa Police station, the other day, demanding the handing over of the drivers of a bus and a lorry, responsible for the death of a mother and her 13-year-old daughter in an accident. The mobs were seen on Television, threatening the police personnel who were trying to calm the situation, to no avail, necessitating the summoning of police reinforcements from a nearby station. Meanwhile, the day before, in Badulla, yet another mob were seeing besieging the police contingent who had come to settle a dispute over the takeover of a playground. Later the mob who became increasingly unruly were seen hooting at the police.
True, Monday's incident was not the first time that a police station was surrounded by mobs. One recalls a similar instance, not many moons ago, when the Angulana Police station was surrounded by villagers following the death of two youth in police custody. However the recent trend points to rising hostility towards the country's law enforcement, if not contained, could threaten the maintenance of law and order in the country. The Police should assert itself during such situations, not allowing mobs to take the upper hand, lest this conveys the wrong impression to trouble makers that the police could dealt with at their whim. Today, with the Television spotlight focused on all incidents, the tendency could be for mobs to be seen as heroes, with their intimidatory tactics, to browbeat the police into submission. Hence, IGP Pujitha Jayasundera should issue specific instructions to his men not to allow things to get out of hand and for troublemakers to be dealt with severely, without the police getting on the defensive, as we have seen on many an occasion.
The police, as the country's law enforcement authority, cannot be seen to be cowering before a mob. This is not only humiliating to the police service, but also degrading in the eyes of public, considering the awe and respect the khaki uniform commanded in the past. The frequent running battles by the police to control the recent spate of protests, that the public often see on Television, too is a humiliating spectacle that serves to bring down the esteem of the police. Hence, the proposal made by the authorities to confine these protests to designated venues in the city should be seriously considered. The police personnel, by the way, should be given all the incentives to carry out their duties effectively. It goes without saying that only a contented, satisfied, police force will be able to rise to the occasion in the face of any challenge. If not, only halfhearted attempts will be made, not only to control unruly mobs, but also the general duties assigned to them. It is in this light that the proposal to increase the salaries of policemen in certain ranks is to be welcomed. This, while keeping our policemen out of corruption’s way, would also make them put their hearts into their jobs, that would see a more efficient law and order machinery.
While our police are being intimidated by unruly mobs, certain schools too are witnessing mob violence, which, incidentally, are not the doings of hired mobs, but carried out, courtesy, the students themselves, and what is more, with the parents too joining the party. The recent incident at Dharmapala Vidyalaya, Kotte, is a case in point. Here, students and parents had banded together, demanding the ouster of a new principal taking office and the form the protest took is something the authorities should sit up and take note. While the students were creating the ruckus, some even lighting crackers within the schools premises, the parents wore black bands across their faces, gesticulating wildly, aiding and abetting the mayhem. In the melee, the principal, who was besieged, and taking refuge in a room, was forced to tender his resignation and leave, amidst the din.
This is hardly the picture one associates with a school, whose chief role is, not only to impart a sound education to the children, but mould their characters and be responsible for their correct formation, to make them worthy citizens of the country. But what the public was made to witness were scenes of anarchy, and what is worse, two teachers of the school were said to be behind the incidents of instigating and inciting the students to oust the principal.
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam should initiate a full scale investigation, in order to get to the bottom of the whole incident. The principal concerned came to take up duties as per the Ministry instructions and what eventually took place was an affront to the Minister and the government no less.
