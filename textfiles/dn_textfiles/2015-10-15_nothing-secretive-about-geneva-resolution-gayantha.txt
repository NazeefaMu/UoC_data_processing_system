Nothing secretive about Geneva Resolution - Gayantha

Parliament Reforms and Mass Media Minister Gayantha Karunathilake said there was no need for the government to hide anything about the Geneva Resolution.
The minister who refuted a statement by the joint opposition at the Cabinet press briefing at the Information Department, said the Geneva Resolution will be debated on October 23 and 24.
He said the government moved this motion as a government proposal.
Karunathilake said if the government was concealing facts about the Geneva Resolution, it would not move a motion and grant two days for a debate.
He said the government could not move this motion for a two day debate last week as the Prime Minister was not in Sri Lanka.
Minister Karunathilake said the so called joint opposition has been set up by bankrupt parliamentarians.
He said they were spreading baseless rumours.
Karunathilake said the Cabinet also decided to allow Provincial Chief Ministers as well as Parliamentary Committee chairmen to participate in Cabinet meetings once every two months.
The minister said the Cabinet also decided to formulate a proper mechanism to grant diplomatic passports. He added that during the previous regime, a number of diplomatic passports were given without following a proper mechanism.
He said due to this reason a number of unwanted persons had obtained diplomatic passports.
