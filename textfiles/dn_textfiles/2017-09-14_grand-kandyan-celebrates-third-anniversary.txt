Grand Kandyan celebrates third anniversary

The Grand Kandyan in Kandy, one of the heavily invested single owner hotel projects in the region, will celebrate its third anniversary on October 9. The hotel owned by the diversified Devon Group Kandy, known for their restaurant and catering business, has invested nearly Rs. 2 million for the hotel project.
The idea to build a five star hotel was first spelled out and initial touches were laid down by the founder of the group, Dharmdasa Weerarathne.
The present Chairman, Gamini Weerarathne, who took over the reins then completed the project making it one of its unique properties in Sri Lanka, packed with unmatched features.
Firstly, he hired a Thai architect to design the hotel. Due to the Thai influence, one could see a lot of gold colouring and architecture used for the hotel. In addition, very spacious rooms and corridors are laid out with ample walking space for guests to freely move around.
“Today almost 90% of the hotels have the Bevis Bawa architecture and the Grand Kandyan offers a completely different theme which makes the property unique,” said its General Manager Thusith Samaraweera.
The theme of the hotel is based on the 'peacock' which is also influenced by Thai architecture. The hotel also offers one of the largest hotel corridors in Sri Lanka.
The swimming pool too was built on the fifth floor allowing guests to swallow the scenic beauty with unparalleled, panoramic view of spectacular greenery of tropical hills and the UNESCO heritage City of Kandy.
A jaccuzi and a kids' pool is also laid out on the same floor along with a pool terrace and outdoor bar. “In a bid to add more recreation a CocoSpa offers an exceptional spa experience to guests by the Balinese therapists that are trained in our own spa school in Indonesia.”
The hotel is equipped with a gymnasium on par with any modern outfit found anywhere in the world. A games arcade is also something unique to a Sri Lanka hotel and offers variety of fun and interactive games for children of ages between 5 to 18.
“At The Grand Kandyan, guests are treated with the reverence, respect and care such as is given to royalty. With the plethora of thing to do and see, one loses track of time at this majestic, luxurious retreat,” he said.
One of the biggest revenue generators to the hotel is their banquet market offering four choices.
The Royal Peacock ballroom with sparkling crystal chandeliers which have adjustable lighting, lends an unforgettable ambience has the biggest such facility in the region with seating capacity of 350 to a maximum of 1,000.
Golden Eagle mainly targets business meetings or conference facilities and can be used independently or together with Flamingo with minimum seating capacity of 150 to maximum 400. Falcon room offers facilities for 100 guests.
The wide selection of restaurants include the all-day dining Tamarind restaurant, Lemongrass manned by a Thai chef and Indigo, an elegant venue that mostly serves contemporary Indian cuisine specially prepared by the Indian chef who is specialized in both north and South Indian cuisine.
LITZ Bar and Lounge while catering to the guests is also open for private functions. Opera (Lobby Cafe) is the second facility, a perfect business and social hub in the middle of the magnificent lobby.
“Sky Lounge, the rooftop sky lounge offers an amazing place to chill out with stunning 360° panoramic views over the mountain range and the city of Kandy.”
The hotel has 100 standard, deluxe, honeymoon suites and Presidential suites all offering twin, queen or king sized beds, workstation, en suite bathroom with shower or bath, mini bar, in room safe, flat screen TV, complementary Wi-Fi, tea and coffee making facilities, 24-hHour Front Desk and Concierge, 24-hour Room Service, Laundry Service and many other facilities.
