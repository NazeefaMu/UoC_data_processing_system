Be Truly  Green!

Green architecture, or green design, is an approach to building that minimizes harmful effects on human health and the environment. The "green" architect or designer attempts to safeguard air, water, and earth by choosing eco-friendly building materials and construction practices. "GREEN" BUILDING:
You don't need a green roof to be a green building, although Italian architect Renzo Piano not only created a green roof, but also specified recycled blue jeans as insulation in his design of the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco.
You don't need a vertical garden or green wall to have a green building, yet French architect Jean Nouvel has successfully experimented with the concept in his design for One Central Park residential building in Sydney, Australia.
Construction processes are also part of green building design. How did Great Britain transform a brown field into the site of the London 2012 summer Olympic Games? Dredging waterways, sourcing building materials, recycling concrete, and using rail and water to deliver materials are just some of their 12 Green Ideas—implemented by the host country and overseen by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the ultimate authority for requiring Olympic-sized sustainable development.
The highest goal of green architecture is to be fully sustainable. Simply put, you do "green" things in order to achieve sustainability. While most green buildings do not have all of the following features, green architecture and design may include: *Ventilation systems designed for efficient heating and cooling *Energy-efficient lighting and appliances *Water-saving plumbing fixtures *Landscapes planned to maximize passive solar energy *Minimal harm to the natural habitat *Alternate power sources such as solar power or wind power *Non-synthetic, non-toxic materials used inside and out *Locally-obtained woods and stone, eliminating long-haul transportation *Responsibly-harvested woods *Adaptive reuse of older buildings *Use of recycled architectural salvage *Efficient use of space *Optimal location on the land, maximizing sunlight, winds, and natural sheltering WHOLE BUILDING DESIGN:

Green design has many related names and concepts associated with it, besides sustainable development. Some people emphasize the ecology and have adopted names like eco-design, eco-friendly architecture, and even arcology. Others take their cue from the environmental movement, arguably begun by Rachel Carson's 1962 book Silent Spring—earth-friendly architecture, environmental architecture, natural architecture, and even organic architecturehave aspects of green architecture.
A building can look beautiful and even be constructed from very expensive materials, but not be "green." Likewise, a building can be very "green" but visually unappealing. How do we get good architecture? How do we move toward what Roman architect Vitruvius suggested to be thethree rules of architecture—to be well-built, useful by serving a purpose, and beautiful to look at?
The National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS) argues that sustainability has to be part of the whole design process, from the very start of the project. They devote an entire website to WBDG—Whole Building Design Guide at www.wbdg.org/. Design objectives are interrelated, where designing for sustainability is just one aspect. "A truly successful project is one where project goals are identified early on," they write, "and where the interdependencies of all building systems are coordinated concurrently from the planning and programming phase." Green architectural design should not be an add-on. - thoughtco.com
