Edulink International campus launches ‘The EDU 360° Challenge’

Matching the right skills and talent development for future market requirements, motivating students to build on their strategic leadership skills, develop confidence and interpersonal relationships, develop time management skills, Edulink International campus launches an exciting and innovative competition titled “The EDU 360° Challenge”.
Organised by Edulink International Campus with the clear intention of inspiring young school leavers in honing the skills of school leavers for the corporate world, the competition will involve group activities on strategy, entertainment activities and an after party.
Students will be testing limits and pushing boundaries to complete exciting races, scavenger hunts and a host of interesting challenges within a stipulated time period, with the ultimate winner carrying away a trip to Malaysia for two nights and three days.
The second and third prize winners will be awarded a holiday package in a five-star hotel and high tea at the Hotel Galadari.
Director Edulink International Campus Kanishka Weeramunda says, “We wanted to take a deep dive into helping eliminate and minimise the soft skills gap that exists among students in terms of being prepared to face the corporate world. Students need to have strong communication and problem-solving skills, leadership and teamwork if they want to succeed in the workplace today.
It has been found that whilst many young students today are well qualified, these soft skills are greatly lacking. We believe that competitions of this nature will motivate students to learn these skills and understand their importance. Having these top soft skills on a resume could translate to placement in a much higher level job, resulting in a significantly higher pay for such students.”
The event will be held June 24 from 9 am at the Colombo Racecourse Grounds.
