Celebrating its 20th anniversary, the forthcoming ‘Hotel Show Colombo 2018’ organized by the Ceylon Hotel School Graduates Association (CHSGA) together with its professional event partner CDC Events will be held from July 20 to 22 at the BMICH.
As a novel part of this mega event being held for the hospitality and leisure industry in Sri Lanka and the region, The Room Stylist Competition will be held under the purview of renowned Housekeeping professionals. This competition will further enhance the vital aspect of the Housekeeping sector in providing a luxurious sleep experience for their guests. As a run up to the event, a series of training programs were held on regional levels for hotels and resorts island-wide.

The Hotel bedding revolution is a global phenomenon today and the hotels in Sri Lanka are no exception to it. In addition to the other aspects of room décor and facilities, the creative art of bed making adds to the visual experience for its guests. Hotel Show attracts products and services representing thousands of global brands, with visitors and buyers from Sri Lanka, Maldives, Seychelles, India and other South Asian countries attending. This event is recognized as a platform that guarantees its sponsors and exhibitors a high level of business opportunities to reach their business expectations.
“Hotel Show is an annual event which continues to evolve as a meeting point for the country’s and regional hospitality industry.”
“It provides a valuable opportunity to achieve our strategic objective of providing a global window to the SME capabilities we have developed locally in sync with the phenomenal growth happening in Sri Lanka’s hospitality sector.” commented Samantha Gunarathna, President of CHSGA.
“The results of the Room Stylist Competition will underline the fact that Sri Lanka’s hotel housekeeping teams are the backbone of the country’s aspiration to be a world-leading holiday destination.”
