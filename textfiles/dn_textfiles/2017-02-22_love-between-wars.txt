Love between wars

Since reading the voluminous novel The War and Peace by the celebrated Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy, I have a feeling that the title ‘War novel’ is a defased usage for narratives woven around the subject of war. There are quite a number of human aspects linked to war and peace. From times immemorial, the poets and novelists have tried to dele on the subject not to create mere snapshots on warfare but to go several steps ahead in order to gauge the intensity of human degradation, disaster and agony that spring up in war-torn human settlements.
The novel titled as Half of a Yellow Sun by Chimamanda Ngozi Adiche is one such example written with a vast insights on Nigerian Biafra war of 1967 – 1970. As the writer states, while some of the experiences are drawn from her family background, where the war has brought about disaster, the rest comes as drawn from her research continuously held since devoting time to reading and observing the relevant sources.
Basically the shifting narration paves the way to gauge the nuances on which the pivotal experiences of the central theme of divided by war, united by love, rest. Though the narrative is seen from several points of view it is actually a novel without a novel type of narrative. There are insiders who experience the war as well as outsiders who come to know of the intensity of the war, both as natives and visitors of Biafra.
The outsiders manage to lead a day to day life in safety, while the insiders who face the disaster sacrifice their life to bombshells and fire. The creative writer in Adichi paves the way for the reader to see that the insiders are by and large in majority than the outsiders. For the outsiders, the war becomes a game.
Adichi states that she has war victims from her own family circles and from who she had had sensitive impact in the creation of several characters and situations. The research component that goes into the creative process of the work is significant. Adiche had managed to browse through almost all the African war sources from writers such as Chinua Achebe (Girls at war an other stories), Lechi Amahi (Sunset at Biafra), Cyprian Ekwansi (Divided we Stand), Fredrich Forsyth (Biafra Story) and Herbert Gold (Biafra Goodbye). The book within the pages of the visible work is titled as ‘The World Was Silent When We Died’ never comes to light and written in fragments enabling the reader to gauge the two layers in one work.
The portrayal of Richard is seen as a wise man who tries to teach the ignorant people around him. He sees the vanity of human idiocy, power and vanity of storing more and more wealth. For him the love of people becomes the central vision that should be inculcated. As such he shows the learning of the ancestors as the wealth and war as the destructive force.
Richard who looks at the world situation as an existentialist sees the war as an ugly factor. His vision is that the man is not civilised enough to know the beauty of existence. He denounces the colonial rule and the advent of two foreign war correspondents to report the war-torn situation. At times he becomes silent in the face of such correspondents declaring his stance.
The other three characters in the cluster of 10 to 15 that emerge are namely Olanna, Kainene and Susan. They have a particular role to play in contrast to Richard., whose interests are broad and visionary. The situation that get created by them throw light to the central intention of Adichi, in the formation of war and love.
Adichi visualises how the impact of Nigeria – Biafra war has become a political issue. It is the inner layer of the situations which emerge not only as a dispute that arises from two lands, but also as a racial and ethnic struggle of two communities as kindled by extraneous power structures who could be discerned as forces of exploitation. The narrative is well constructed exhibiting some of the mythological and legendary elements common to African regions.
