Charmed curse

One of Vijaya’s men went after her, although he was forbidden by the prince (for he thought), ‘Only where there is a village are dogs to be found.’ Her mistress, a yakkhini named Kuvanna (Kuvani), sat there at the foot of a tree spinning, as a woman-hermit might.
When the man saw the pond and the woman-hermit sitting there, he bathed there and drank and taking young shoots of lotuses and water in lotus-leaves he came forth again. And she said to him: “Stay! thou art my prey!”. Then the man stood there as if fast bound. But because of the power of the magic thread she could not devour him, and though he was entreated by the yakkhini, the man would not yield up the thread. Then the yakkhini seized him, and hurled him who cried aloud into a chasm. And there in like manner she hurled (all) the seven hundred one by one after him.
So begins George Turnour’s edition of the Mahavansa. Named whether Kuveni or Kuvanna, the contemporary Sri Lankans need no introduction to this lady of yore. Kuveni has already established her brand name as the ladylove of our oldest king, Vijaya, who later abandoned her for his own good.
Authenticity
Ravibandu Vidyapathy
History, however, is subject to alteration and modification in the hands of artists. The modification could sound too euphemistic a term for distortion. But then no one looks for authenticity in artistic works. If you need authenticity, look up for academic sources and not artistic works. Ravibandu Vidyapathy seems to have taken a cue from this phenomenon.
His latest stage production, Kuvanna, a dance drama, reaches us as a slightly modified interpretation to the Mahavansa narrative of the monumental lady. King Vijaya seeks forgiveness from Kuveni in the prologue of the dance drama. But the lady is not ready to offer forgiveness yet. As scenes finally progress into the epilogue, Kuveni has grown soft enough to forgive the old king. Vijaya and Kuveni become the lovable, though not royal, pair. Their relationship becomes something that the contemporary audience should aspire to. Moulding heroines on stage is no strange encounter for Ravibandu. He introduced his own Lady Macbeth to the local stage only a few years ago. In contrast to Kuvanna, Lady Macbeth was introduced as a crafty and shrewd character in the centre of a political controversy.
Kuvanna is a teaching and learning project involving 200 students chosen from cultural centres across the island. The centres are under the direct command of the Cultural Affairs Ministry.
“My objective is introducing the young talent to the national theatre. It is something more than an opportunity. They learn various techniques of choreography and theatre. At cultural centres, their education is confined to traditional dance. But when they are involved in a theatre production, their horizons expand,” Vidyapathi elaborated.
Soft and feminine
A core objective of the Cultural Affairs Ministry is encouraging and promoting intangible traditional cultures – a move recommended by the UNESCO as well.
“I see Kuveni as an ordinary woman. She deserves sympathy. Vijaya betrayed Kuveni. But I pity Vijaya as well,” Vidyapathi takes stock of the historical account.
The Kohomba Kankariya element has also been syringed into the dance drama owing to its links with Kandyan tradition. Vidyapathi entertains two versions of Kuveni: one coarse, the other softer and more feminine. Unlike his previous ballet production, woven around Lady Macbeth, the audience will have a brief idea about the storyline as the chorus sings out.
“They have already heard the Mahavansa version of the story. But with the chorus, the audience will have some idea about my interpretation. Some may understand and accept. Some may not understand and reject it altogether,” Vidyapathy mused.
Kuvanna is an offshoot of the various workshops held across the country. In his capacity as Advisor to Cultural Affairs Minister S B Navinna on Arts, Ravibandu Vidyapathy has worked with several groups of young dancers.
“Of course they are not equally talented. But they are brimming with talent. What they need is polishing up. We have chosen dancers aged between 12 and 25 based on a certain criterion. The ministry conducts intercultural competitions for dance. We have handpicked the winners for the dance drama.”
Most productions that come to light on the Nelum Pokuna theatre cannot perform the same feat elsewhere. Does Vidyapathy face the same situation with a crew of over 200?
“Everything else of this play is simple. The rest is simple, basic and symbolic. So they are easy to transport. We are already making plans to take the production to other parts of the country as well,” Vidyapathy said.
Kuveni has cast a curse on this island nation, we have been told. The curse remains active in Vidyapathy’s production but transforms into a charm along with the feminine softness inherent in her.
