Qatar Airways sweeps int'l awards ceremonies

It has been a record-breaking year for Qatar Airways, as the airline has claimed more global awards than ever before in its 20th year of operations. Qatar's national carrier has received more than 50 individual awards across multiple categories since January, demonstrating its continued commitment to exceeding passenger expectations with its innovative approach to product development and dedication to customer experience.
At a time when many airlines are scaling back and during a particularly challenging year, Qatar Airways continues to thrive, showcasing its best-in-class cabins, crew, catering, in-flight entertainment, on-board magazine, lounges and more.
Notably, Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker, received the ‘Aviation Executive of the Year’ award from industry body CAPA last month, highlighting his leadership and innovative direction in guiding the growth of the airline and the wider aviation industry as a whole.
Leading the host of awards received by the airline this year is the prestigious accolade of 2017 ‘Airline of the Year,’ awarded by international air transport rating organisation Skytrax.
Known as ‘the Oscars of the aviation industry,’ Qatar Airways was also named ‘World's Best Business Class,’ ‘Best Airline in the Middle East,’ and ‘World's Best First Class Airline Lounge’ at the Skytrax awards ceremony held in Paris in June.
Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive, Akbar Al Baker, said: “The many awards Qatar Airways has received this year stand as firm recognition of our ongoing commitment to our passengers to constantly innovate in order to deliver the finest experience available, both in the skies and on the ground."
Significantly, Qatar Airways was also recognised for its launch of Qsuite, the airline's revolutionary new ‘First in Business Class’ product, receiving the ‘Best Airline Innovation of the Year’ award at the 2017 ULTRAS (Ultimate Luxury Travel Related Awards) in London.
Qatar Airways was also voted ‘Best Airline’ at the 2017 Business Traveller awards held in London, where it won a raft of other major awards, including ‘Best Airline in the Middle East,’ ‘Best Business Class’ and ‘Best Long Haul Airline’.
Additionally, the carrier was awarded ‘Best Cabin Service’ and ‘Best Food and Beverage’ at the 2017 APEX Passenger Choice awards held during this year's annual APEX Expo in Las Vegas.
The airline also received the evening's highest ranking as a five-star airline from more than half a million passengers who took part.
Qatar Airways also took home four wins at this year's TravelPlus Airline Amenity Bag Awards. The airline's new range of on-board products won the awards for ‘First Class Female Amenity Kit’, ‘Business Class Middle East Amenity Kit’, ‘Children's Goody Bag’ (over six years old) and ‘Sleeper Suit/Pyjamas’ as the prestigious industry event.
Qatar Airways’ in-flight magazine, Oryx, also won the ‘Custom Redesign of the Year’ award at Folio magazine's Eddie & Ozzie awards.
Additionally, Qatar Airways Cargo was named the ‘Global Cargo Airline of the Year’ at the Air Cargo Africa 2017 awards held earlier this year.
Additionally, the cargo carrier was named ‘Overall Carrier of the Year’ at the highly anticipated Payload Asia Awards Ceremony in Singapore in October, and ‘Best Cargo Airline in Customer Services’ at the Cargo India awards held in Ahmedabad, India. a
