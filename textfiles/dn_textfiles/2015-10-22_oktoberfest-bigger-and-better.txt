Authentic German food, lots of brew, Bavarian Music, German entertainment and a festive ambiance is what one will get at Hilton Colombo's original and authentic German food festival - the Oktoberfest. Hilton Colombo, the pioneers of Oktoberfest in Sri Lanka will host this event for the 22nd consecutive year from October 29 to November 7 at the hotel's Sports Centre Arena.
Oktoberfest will be staged in a giant marquee that can accommodate up to 1000 guests, while tucking into some of the finest Oktoberfest food such as traditional German Sausages, Pork Knuckles, Roast Chicken, Sauerkraut, Giant Pretzels and a feast of other Bavarian dishes. It's time to wear the top hats and give a hearty "Prost" with friends whilst the 7 member Bavarian band plays Oom-Pah music. The band will be flown in from Germany especially for the occasion along with 2 German Serving girls.
Daily raffle draws, brew drinking competitions and the famous traditional hat games are in store for all who patronize the event.
