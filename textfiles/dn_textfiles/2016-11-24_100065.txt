Kandy SC adapt well to wet conditions

 
Kandy SC claimed their second victory in the 2016-17 inter-club league rugby tournament after overcoming a downpour in Colombo. This win for the defending champions was hugely impressive as they showed their full box of tricks and played the rugby that was required in the torrential rain.
The Nittawela club and the soldiers played hard in the bucketing rain handling the wet ball admirably.
The elements were hugely challenging but Kandy SC, who missed their rugby chairman Lasantha Wijesuriya in the last outing, had his presence and advice in this game.
He handled the game brilliantly and adjusted their game plan accordingly and was able to score 34 points against 10. They should have scored more points but the wet ball prevented it. Twenty-four points in the first 40 minutes gave them a great platform to launch and as the time ran out the scores kept rolling on.
With confidence at an all-time high, Kandy SC captain Rohan Weeraratne kept his cool in the game. Army SC played a fine game in the last 20 minutes.
It was a class act and they showed that they are a good team capable of causing upsets along the way, but here they committed too many errors and Kandy SC took full advantage of them. Sad to say three of the Army’s top players were side lined due to disciplinary reasons, by the SLRFU and also their coach. They are a side that's building up and with more focus are sure to do well in the remaining games.
A notable incident that occurred during the match was when referee when Priyantha Gunaratne was tackled in the seventh minute of the game by a soldier.
The first half was played without lights and in the second half they had to introduce lights due to semi-darkness. In the 12th minute of the second half play was halted for about seven minutes due to lightning.
