No Sri Lankans killed in Toronto attack

No Sri Lankan citizen was killed in the recent vehicle attack in Toronto, the Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday, contrary to news reports.
“Names of victims identified and confirmed by the relevant Canadian authorities at present do not include Sri Lankan citizens,” the Ministry said in a release. “We will continue to engage with the relevant authorities and will share confirmed information when available.”
A Foreign Ministry spokesperson said the Consulate General in Toronto is working with Canadian authorities, including the Toronto Police.
A man killed ten people in the Canadian city on Monday after driving his van onto crowded sidewalk.
