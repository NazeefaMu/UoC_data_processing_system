Real life ‘Robocop’

Meet the real life ‘Robocop’ - a robot police officer that can identify criminals, find fires and even give you directions to the loo.
What’s more, this little guy never gets tired or needs a break and can be on non-stop patrol whenever it’s needed. Known as Anbots, these devices are currently patrolling the streets of China.
The robots can act as ‘sheriffs’ with their built in facial recognition software which can help track suspects wanted by police. ‘Robocop’ can also give you directions if you are lost or looking for a specific location and can spot fire emergencies.
It is also able to monitor air temperature and quality.
The robots stand at around 1.6 metres tall and moves by itself using a series of voice commands and cameras.
Anbots have been stationed at the Zhengzhou East Railway Station in Henan to test their effectiveness when it comes to assisting the public.
Further developments of the robot include its ability to detect threatening situations and an ‘anti-riot tool’ which can be used to help control hostile crowds. Science Times
