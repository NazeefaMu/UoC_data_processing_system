Greatness thrust upon SWRD

SWRD Bandaranaike, the chairman of the party and Prime Minister, interrupted his speech to honour the monk who arrived late; then he walked up to him to pay his obeisance to the man who conspired and lured the assassination four and a half months later.
The troubled 7th annual conference was held on May 16 and 17, 1959, at Kurunegala 58 years ago, under the auspices of founder Bandaranaike. The factional struggles and ideological clashes within the coalition of SLFP/VLSSP [Philip]/ BP [Daha] that formed the ruling party Mahajana Eksath Peramuna [MEP] had by this time reached a climax.
Ven. Buddharakkita Thera, a powerful force behind the regime thought SWRD was drifting towards the left under the influence of Philip Gunawardena, ‘father of Marxism in the island’. The high priest was at the centre of chaos; he purposely arrived late to the sessions. The controversial monk walked right into the hall in a hostile way commanding attention. Chairman of the party and PM Bandaranaike was on his feet -- the entire audience stood up.
The charismatic and malicious monk who usually did not care about the opinions, rights, or feelings of others had a quick look at the audience with a flash of cheeky smile and focused pompously at the figures seated on the stage, but paid little attention on the Chair or the Speaker. SWRD Bandaranaike, the chairman of the party and Prime Minister interrupted his speech and walked up to pay his obeisance to the man who conspired to assassinate him four and a half months later.
The atmosphere was electrified as SWRD continued his address with a changed tone and emphasizing the fact that the SLFP and the government strictly followed the middle path. Receiving thunderous applause for his ‘Kurunegala Doctrine’, a coinage by scribes of the day, he said, “We are opposed to both Communism and Fascism to Capitalism and Materialism. Our party stands against any attempt to impose any of these on the people of this country” as he was under pressure by the monk and the right wing led by Stanley de Zoysa, W Dahanayake and R. G. Senanayake. They took control of affairs at the summit from the moment the monk walked in; the meeting tilted in favour of the right, while a disillusioned leader, the Prime Minister watched haplessly.
Parliamentary democracy
Both Bandaranaikes -- SWRD and Sirima -- came from the aristocratic property owning feudalistic class, who acted against their class interest. They nationalized bus companies, Colombo harbour, insurance, petroleum, plantations and introduced many more socialist measures such as the Paddy Lands Act. SWRD’s exit from the UNP to break or challenge the domination of political supremacy held by an urban elite and create a situation that cemented a two party system which is a necessary ingredient for proper parliamentary democracy, where people could select an alternative party.
SWRD Bandaranaike, the young Oxonian returning from Britain, firmly believed in a Federal structure for the island nation; however, later entering competitive politics, he and the party blundered by choosing to propagate ‘nationalism’, language issues that ultimately led to decades long communal clashes, terrorism and civil war. With the formation of the coalition MEP, the SLFP gained a reputation as a socialist-oriented party. SWRD, though aligned with the Marxist parties -- the leader submitted to extremist nationalist forces that became unmanageable; the result was strict implementation of ‘Sinhala Only’ Policy, creating ethnic disharmony and clashes that began in 1958. In Shakespearian drama, Malvolio remarks; “In my stars, I am above thee; but be not afraid of greatness: some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon ‘em.”—Act 2 - Scene 5: ‘Twelfth Night’.
Was Solomon West Ridgway Dias Bandaranaike born great, achieved greatness or had ‘greatness thrust upon him’?
SWRD’s election campaign
Ven. Mapitigama Buddharakkita Thera, the chief incumbent of the historic Kelaniya Raja Maha Vihara was also the leader of the influential United Bhikku Front (Eksath Bhikku Peramuna); his close association, political and personal with Health Minister Wimala Wijewardene was no secret. They played a crucial role in mobilizing support for the MEP during the 1956 elections. The party created in 1951 managed to form a coalition government within five years.
Ven. Buddharakkita had been a ‘businessmen’ who prudently dipped in to import and export trade, and was a wealthy monk, who had little respect for vinaya rules. The powerful prelate had lavishly spent for SWRD’s election campaign. He was responsible for staging a satyagraha with 500 monks at Prime Minister’s Rosemead Place residence in 1957, compelling the PM to abrogate the pact he signed with the leader of the Tamil community aimed at devolving a reasonable power-sharing between Sinhala and Tamil speaking communities. The head prelate’s association with the fair minister had been the subject of gossip of news sheets and pamphlets. SWRD ignored minister’s urge for taking action against perpetrators.
The crisis within the SLFP brewed over this plus government’s left wings opposition to granting a shipping tender violating the procedures to Ven. Buddharakkita. Personal disputes and policy issues within members of the party had to be settled by the leader in many instances. An unparalleled ‘Cabinet strike’ orchestrated by the right wing ministers was a tragedy he faced during his short rule of three and a half years.
The influential monk wanted to import rice from Burma (present Myanmar) through his shipping company, to which left wing senior Cabinet Ministers opposed. SWRD respected his minister’s advice and refused to grant the money-spinning shipping contract to the prelate’s nominee. Next, tenders were called for purchasing two ships -- the monk made an effort to obtain the tender through his authority to which PM refrained from interfering.
Provoked by this ‘step-motherly treatment’ the prelate decided on a course of action that led to the assassination of Prime Minister Bandaranaike on September 26, 1959, by a hired gunman, an Aryuvedic lecturer and an extremist ‘Sinhala-Buddhist’ monk. Thalduwe Somarama was lured to believe SWRD was planning to divide the country.
