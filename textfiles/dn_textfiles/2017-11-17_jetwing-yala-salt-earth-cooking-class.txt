Jetwing Yala Salt of the Earth Cooking Class

Juliet Coombe learns how danger is the salt of pleasure and spices up her cooking style in a fish baking master class with Jetwing Yala’s inventive executive chef Nalin Nanayakkara.
At 5.30am we headed off to buy the catch of the day a delicious white fleshy fish known as mullet and to make sure it was really fresh we bought directly from the local fisherman at Kirinda fishing harbour, which is just one of the highlights of doing a Yala hands on salt baking cooking class, an exciting experience run by Jetwing Yala’s innovative executive chef Nalin Nanayakkara. Returning to the hotel after lots of negotiating on the fish price of the day the fish was cleaned and we washed as well, and once in chefs gear headed for the kitchen to learn how to cook our mullet with an infusion of spices mixed into a large mountain of salt, which is heaps of fun and not dissimilar to playing in a sand pit. Nanayakkara has experimented with cooking in mud, the sand dunes and many other things, but feels salt infused with spices as a baking material has far the best results.
Specially built roads
Nanayakkara had us mixing spices thirteen different spices in fact with sea salt and then packing the fish in until it was ready to bake for 22 minutes in the oven. Nanayakkara tells me and my two sons that the next time they pick up a salt shaker to season their food, to remember that eaten salt is essential to life and constitutes a mere 6% of the annual 200 million tonnes consumed in the world.
As our fish cooked like a salt bake we learnt how to make a chocolate bomb to go with it and I had also had a chance to find out more about salt as a cooking material. Amazingly this benign looking product has an extremely colourful history that will amaze you. Apart from embedding itself in cultural phrases like ‘they are the salt of the earth’ and ‘danger is the salt of pleasure’ and biblical metaphors for good people, it has been regarded in the past as the essence of good tasting food with wars being fought over it, governments being toppled over it and countries revolting over taxes on it. Indeed, it is thought that the French Revolution was partly owing to the salt tax, which after being repealed was re-imposed by Napoleon and only abolished in 1945. Gandhi in India famously led 100,000 protestors, in 1930, to obtain it from the sea to avoid paying tax on it as well as using it to inspire rebellion against British rule, which he finally helped to overthrow.
Salt’s known history goes back some 8,000 years when, in Romania, they boiled spring water to get it and on Xiechi Lake near Yuncheng in Shanxi, China, there is a salt works still producing to this day that dates back that far. Salt has been pivotal to civilisation throughout history and an important trade article, transported around the Mediterranean Sea by boat, along specially built roads and through the Sahara on camels.
What is the other 94% used for? Close to Sri Lanka’s heart is the production of iodised salt which has vastly reduced the incidence of brain retarded children and goitres, neck swellings and iron fortified salt that reduces anaemia and other iron deficiency health issues. There are many health benefits to eating salt but clearly, too much of a good thing will always have side effects and those with high blood pressure need to be careful.
Primary requirements
How did we manage before fridges were invented? In the case of meat and fish, they were and sometimes still are wrapped in salt and when cooked in a bed of salt, provide the most delicious meal. People use it in animal feed, fertilizer, cosmetics and medicine. It is also used in a staggering 14,000 plus industrial products ranging from pool disinfectant, rubber, plastic, paper, glass, polyester, sodium hydroxide, magnesium sulphate, gypsum, potash, magnesia, household bleaches, detergents, dyes and soap.
In the past, salt was held in such high esteem that it was used in the Middle East to seal an agreement; by the Hebrews in their covenants with God when sprinkling it over meat offerings; and in ancient times of war, for salting the earth after victory to curse the defeated if they ever tried to re-conquer it.
Sri Lanka is blessed with both being surrounded by sea so no shortage of supply in salt there and having lots of sun and warmth, the two primary requirements of making sea salt – they simply have to channel the sea into inland lagoons, called salterns such as the ones at Hambantota, Bundala and Palatupana and wait for the sun to evaporate the water and crystallise the salt, which takes around 40 days. It is then scraped up and left underneath a covering of coconut leaves before being crushed and packaged. Sri Lanka consumes around 150,000 tons of salt per year and is curiously not yet self sufficient in it, but plans are afoot for it to be so by 2020 and even Jetwing Yala are getting in on the act as they are planning on creating their own salt spiced up mixes to sell. Who knows we may see a whole new style of food dishes with salts such as smoked, black pepper, chilli, garlic, curry and lemon and thyme coming onto the market.
Much more can be said about salt that would fill whole books and without it, there would be no life, so join the salt of the earth and get creative like Jetwing Yala chef Nanayakkara has using salt as an unique cooking method by infusing it with island spices. Once baked the fish was taken out and the kids were allowed to break it open sending salt flying in all directions a bit like an ice block, but always being careful not to break the fish skin, which would let the salt from outside get into the white succulent flesh. Once the salt had been removed the exterior skin and scales of the fish was peeled back and enjoyed with a variety of exciting curry saucy sauces.
