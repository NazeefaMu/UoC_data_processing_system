Restoring equal rights and dignity in face of adversity

Friday, February 20, 2017, marked the eleventh annual United Nations' World Day of Social Justice, a day dedicated to advancing a world that promotes a peaceful and prosperous co-existence. It also encourages people to look at how social justice affects poverty eradication. It also focuses on the goal of achieving full employment and support for social integration.
In one of his most famous writings, "Letter from Birmingham Jail," Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said of injustice: "Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly."
In other words, the very existence of injustice has implications for us all. As such, we each have a responsibility to actively challenge unjust power structures wherever they should surface.
There are many aspects to justice and the creation of a just world. These include social and economic factors as well as the principles of equity and equal rights. Yet social justice has been defined in a variety of ways. Among them, they incorporate concepts of basic rights, the realisation of human potential, social benefit, a healthy planet, an equitable distribution of resources, equal opportunities and obligations, security, and freedom from discrimination.
Active steps
Economic justice really forms a part of social justice. It seeks the equitable distribution of the world's natural and intellectual wealth so that everyone is able to gain a fair share. Social justice means equal rights for all, regardless of gender, race, class, ethnicity, citizenship, religion, age or sexual orientation. It implies equal rights for women and girls in workplaces, homes and public life.
It implies economic justice, which means governments must take active steps to alleviate poverty and redress past injustices. In a world where millions starve and minorities are discriminated against, such goals are still a long way off.
Governments have made a commitment to the creation of a framework for action that promotes social justice not only at national level, but internationally. In addition, Governments around the world have also pledged to promote equal distributions of income and resources and have recognised that a society for all needs to be based on respect for all human rights.
Across the world, there are thousands of examples of such injustice. It can take the form of repression, discrimination, harassment, or simply the failure to redress inequalities. Social justice means that the rights of all people in our community are considered in a fair and equitable manner. While equal opportunity targets everyone in the community, social justice targets the marginalised and disadvantaged groups of people in our society.
Work opportunities
Urgent action should be taken to increase the number of work opportunities in order to alleviate tensions. Policies need to focus more on strengthening employment and tackling the inequalities.
Furthermore, vulnerable employment is concerning high in developing economics with peaks in Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Public policies should ensure that all people have equal access to health care services. People living in isolated communities should have the same access to clean water and sanitation as a person living in an urban area. People of a low socio-economic background should receive the same quality health services that a person in a higher socio-economic income receives.
Information designed to educate the community must be provided in languages that the community can understand. Many of the themes and agendas over the years have focused on child labour, which refers to the employment of children in any work that deprives them of their childhood, interferes with their ability to attend regular school, and that is mentally, physically, socially or morally dangerous and harmful.
Not all work done by children should be classified as child labour that is to be targeted for elimination. The participation of children or adolescents in work that does not affect their health and personal development or interfere with their schooling, is generally regarded as being something positive.
This includes activities such as helping their parents around the home, assisting in a family business or earning pocket money outside school hours and during school holidays. These kinds of activities contribute to children's development and to the welfare of their families.
Skills and experience
They provide them with skills and experience, and help to prepare them to be productive members of society during their adult life. The term 'child labour' is often defined as work that deprives children of their childhood, their potential and their dignity, and that is harmful to physical and mental development.
Forced labour in general takes different forms, including debt bondage, human trafficking and other forms of modern slavery.
The most vulnerable victims are women and girls forced into prostitution, migrants trapped in debt bondage and sweatshop or farm workers kept there by clearly illegal tactics and paid little or nothing.
No one can be blind to the reality that a generation of children have grown up hearing gunshots, dodging bullets and living in fear for their lives.
Many were forced to become adults before the age of 10, constrained to carry arms and fight in senseless wars they could not comprehend.
Several children dragooned into becoming child soldiers have been maimed, raped and impregnated by men they did not know, or threatened by men who had once sworn to protect them.
These children have suffered numerous atrocities and abuses they could not articulate. Many were forced to live in refugee camps, became victims of sex trafficking, or grew up without parents while suffering through the heartaches and pains of a country in turmoil.
These types of illegal exploitation and forced enslavement are horrendous crimes against humanity. It is time for all right-thinking citizens of the world to rise in one accord and call for a screeching end to such despotic criminality in all its reprehensible forms.
