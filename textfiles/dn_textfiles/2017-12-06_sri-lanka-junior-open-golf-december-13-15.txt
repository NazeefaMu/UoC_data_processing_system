Sri Lanka Junior Open Golf  from December 13 to 15

The most prestigious event in the junior golf calendar, the Sri Lanka Junior Open Golf Championship sponsored by Ceylon Agro Industries(Prima Group) for the 10th consecutive year will take place at the Royal Colombo Golf Club from December 13 to 15.
This year’s sponsorship by Prima Sunrise Bread marks a milestone of the company completing a decade of promoting junior golf at national level in partnership with the Sri Lanka Golf Union (SLGU).
The Sri Lanka Junior Open Golf Championship is the litmus test for juniors who are also required to make it through two Regional Junior Opens, also sponsored by Prima Sunrise Bread, and it is the benchmark for the national rankings of the juniors.
Over 80 juniors will take part in the event under the following age group categories: 15-18 years (gold division), 12-14 years (silverdivision), 10-11 years (bronze division) and 9 years and under (copper division). The overall winners of three days of stroke play over 18 holes will be declared the ‘Sri Lanka Junior National Golf Champion’ for this year.
Vinod Weerasinghe, last year’s winner among the boys remains the firm favourite to win the title aga in. He will be high in confidence, going into the event with the strength of experience gained by his exposure in recent international events in Thailand and India.
Vinod is likely to face stiff competition from Nuwara Eliya’s lad, Dhuwarshan, as well as from Sathsara Dilshan and Armand Flamer Caldera from Colombo. All three young men are currently in sparkling form. Leaders in the girls’ category, Taniya Balasuriya and Kayla Perera will battle it out at the top. In the most junior categories players to watch are, Nirekh Tejwani, Yannik Kumara, K. Danushan, Shanal Binuksha, Reshan Algama, Sherin Balasuriya and Haroon Aslam, all of who will have an opportunity to display their temperament and maturity.
This year’s tournament will also mark the very first time in which participants in the youngest category (under 9 years) will be required to compete in stroke play over all three days of the event.
