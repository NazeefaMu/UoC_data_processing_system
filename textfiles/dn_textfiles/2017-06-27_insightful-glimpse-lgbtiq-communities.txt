Insightful glimpse into the LGBTIQ communities

Improper, distorted and passive interpretation of sex could result in the deprivation of healthy sexual lives among people and increase frustration amongst them. That may eventually pave way for a poor turnover and reduced GDP of a country.
Sex of diverse sorts is treated as a taboo subject in some countries around the globe due to religious, political and socio-cultural factors. Can someone argue that sex too is a relative-factor by taking in Albert Einstein’s discoveries?
Human Rights and Fundamental Rights came into force revitalized in recent times. This drew the attention of scholars, political leaders, opinion-leaders and lobby groups towards the rights of the masses to observe things (inclusive of sex) according to their conscience.
This could boil down even to the subjects of gender equality as well as homo-sexuality, bi-sexuality or lesbianism.
Sex is treated by some societies as a thing that is needed only for reproductive purposes ignoring the fact that it is the decisive obsession that provides pleasures of the skin for mortals in this Blue Planet aka Magul Sakwala.
LGBTIQ communities in some counties are compelled to constantly play ‘hide and seek’ due to the fear of being exposed and loss of face. Plenty of unmarried women and men in a country like ours who are gay or lesbians cannot reveal their true identities. They suffer day-by-day mentally and no one knows who is committing the sin here.
The impact of little actions during a person’s childhood must be seen into in later years by people who discriminate ‘queer people’ before they indulge in such actions.
As the editor of the Equality magazine Rosanna Flamer-Caldera says; “Criminalization of sexual orientation/gender identity merely creates problems and solves none”.
A particular society looking down upon individuals who have their own interpretation of sex as shameful and abnormal is a subject that has to be discussed at length with a cross-section of politicians, scholars, opinion-leaders, teachers, citizens, lobby groups and the clergy.
Equal Ground is an entity that works hard towards fulfilling the needs of the community each year giving the LGBTIQ community the space to stand up tall and be proud of who and what they are.
Being the only organization in Sri Lanka to hold annual Pride celebrations, an important event in the Sri Lanka LGBTIQ calendar, Equal Ground is positioned with the vision; “Equality for all sexual orientations and gender identities; human rights for everyone.”
Colombo Pride festival unveiled by EQUAL GROUND in 2005 is one of the oldest Pride Festivals in South Asia.
Colombo Pride Festival makes way for the LGBTIQ community to showcase their talents. Events include workshops, dramas, musicals, art and photo exhibitions, parties, kite festival and the Abhimani International Film Festival.
An integral part of Colombo Pride has always been the LGBTIQ film festival formally known as Celluloid Rainbows and now branded as ‘Abhimani’.
Abhimani is the only international LGBTIQ film festival in Sri Lanka and the oldest of the kind in South Asia. It is held each year in conjunction with Colombo Pride presenting a collection of Queer short and feature length films from countries around the globe.
The 2017 Abhimani film festival was held from June 19 to 22 at the Goethe-Institut in Colombo.
A collection of absorbing and insightful short and feature length films from India, Pakistan, Hong Kong, Philipines, Australia, South Korea, USA, Romania, Germany and Sri Lanka was screened at the fest free of charge.
