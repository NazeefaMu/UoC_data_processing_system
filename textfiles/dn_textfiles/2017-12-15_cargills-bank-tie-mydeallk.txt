Cargills Bank tie-up with MyDeal.lk

Cargills Bank recently announced its tie-up with MyDeal.lk, one of Sri Lanka’s leading e-commerce website, to guarantee greater convenience to its growing customer base of online shoppers.
The partnership will enable Mydeal.lk customers to make payments for their purchases at any Cargills Food City outlets 365 days of the year, from 8 am to 10 pm. The simplified process now allows customers to click on the ‘Pay at Cargills Food City’ payment option on mydeal.lk website, once they check out their purchases.
A simple click of a button generates a reference number which the customer can provide at their preferred Cargills Food City outlet, to process the payment through their Cargills Cash facility. The automated system will then ensure that the customer's purchases are delivered to their doorstep, once the payment is made. This latest partnership with Cargills Bank offers customers the ease of making purchases using their Cargills Cash account at any of the 330 plus Cargills Food City outlets
