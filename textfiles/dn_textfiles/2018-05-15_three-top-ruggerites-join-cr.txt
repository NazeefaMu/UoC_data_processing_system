Three top ruggerites to join CR?

It is reliably learnt that three top ruggerites – former St. Peter’s College Bambalapitiya rugby captain and skipper of the Sri Lanka under 20 Asian sevens cup champion as well as present Sri Lanka national seven’s utility player Kevin “Kutty” Dixon, ex Wesley College/Sri Lanka national fifteen a side hooker Dulanjana Wijesinghe, and last year’s Isipathana College and Asian under 18 cup champion sevens skipper and centre Sumudu Rankothge have joined CR and FC and will most probably turn out for the Longden Place club in the upcoming 2018/19 rugby season.
The Red Shirts who finished in fifth place out of eight teams in the league championship last season will try to regain their lost prestige by aiming at winning the coveted league championship that has eluded them for the past 20 years in the upcoming 2018/19 season under the leadership of captain Kavindu Perera and head coach Nilfer Ibrahim.
They last won the league in 1998 under the captaincy of scrum half Champika Nishantha.
