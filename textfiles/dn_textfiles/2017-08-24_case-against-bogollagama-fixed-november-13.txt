Case against Bogollagama fixed for November 13

A corruption case filed against former Minister and Eastern Province Governor Rohitha Bogollagama was yesterday fixed for November 13 by the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court.
The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption alleged that Bogollagama while serving as the Minister of Enterprise Development and Investment Promotion had illegally given his approval to release a sum of Rs.1,170444 as hotel accommodation cost in lieu of an investment promotion exhibition held in London on or around June 21 to 23, 2006.
The Bribery Commission further alleged that Bogollagama had also made an influence to the then BOI Chairman to excessively release a sum of Rs.376,196 for the London exhibition contrary to the Treasury accepted recommendations.
