Vegan High Tea at Mount Lavinia Hotel

World Vegan Day on November 1
A growing trend toward health and wellness has inspired many to include a vegan food regime into their daily lifestyle. Serving the purpose of both a nourishing and satisfying meal, Mount Lavinia Hotel introduced the ‘Vegan Buffet’. From pioneers of the Vegan Buffet, Mount Lavinia Hotel will present a “Vegan High Tea” on World Vegan Day on November 1
The ‘Vegan High Tea’ at the famed ‘Terrace’ would be where traditional class meets a lifestyle of healthy living. The three tiered platter will consist of food items made without a single animal product and will have the right mix of sugar ,spice and everything nice. From traditional authentic Sri Lankan ‘Pol Rottis’ and ‘Lavariyas’ to British delights like ‘Scones and Jam’, Red Velvet cakes and Lemon Drizzles; the ‘Vegan High Tea’ is an experiential difference not to be missed out on.
Join us on November 1 from 4 pm onwards.
