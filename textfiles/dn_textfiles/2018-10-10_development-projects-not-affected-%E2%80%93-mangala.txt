Development projects not affected – Mangala

Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera yesterday assured that public investment on development projects has not been hampered by the recent depreciation of the rupee.
The Kandy-Kurunegala Highway, Beliatta railway line, the Gamperaliya programme and ‘Enterprise Sri Lanka’ were going ahead successfully, he said addressing a media briefing at Sirikotha.
The Minister explained that Gamperaliya currently had 33,875 programmes in operation in every village around the country with over Rs. 20 billion allocated for it. Its first phase would be complete by November, whilst the second phase would start in January 2019. Enterprise Sri Lanka which aims to create 100,000 entrepreneurs through the provision of interest-free loans had the government provide Rs. 5 billion for interest payments, in the last three months. As of October 1, the Minister said, 26,978 new loans worth Rs. 5.4 billion had been provided to entrepreneurs. “A bankrupt government cannot do all this, only a people-friendly government can achieve this,” said Minister Samaraweera.
In contrast, he observed that the previous regime had spent millions on roads in Hambantota only to be used by a few vehicles. “But on the other hand, we have, in the same district, 15,000 houses with no toilets, over 2,000 lakes which need to be repaired, and 2,400 schools with no toilets. These were not priorities for the Rajapaksas.”
He further stressed that statements made by the SLFP Group of 16 and the Joint Opposition with regard to the country’s political situation was adversely affecting investment into the country. “When foreigners read what they say, they think that the situation is unstable, making them not want to invest.
Only we know that these people are jokers and should not be taken seriously.”
“Fake news should be checked thoroughly, you cannot believe everything the Opposition says,” he said.
