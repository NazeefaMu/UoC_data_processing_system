Drought affected farmers granted Rs.10,000 allowance: President

 
President Maithripala Sirisena instructed officials to grand a monthly allowance of Rs.10,000 to farmers affected by drought.
District Secretary R.B Wanninayaka said that Divisional Secretaries are engaged in gathering data on drought hit families to grant drought relief.
He added that farmers who have lost their cultivations due to the drought and even those who have not cultivated can receive the drought relief.
"Once we have submitted the data, the Disaster Management Ministry will provide funds to cover the expenses," Wanninayaka said.
Currently thirteen districts are affected by the drought.
