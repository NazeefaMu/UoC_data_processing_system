Poetess unlike any other

The first book of poems by Dr Paramita Mukherjee Mullick is simply called Life A Collection of Poems. There are 60 poems at various length in this little book of 92 pages published by Virgin Leaf Books in Mumbai. The poems are neatly grouped together under the titles Relations, Reflections, Inspirations, Journeys and The Light. It shows her progress from something closer to her to something sublime.
To understand her poems we should know something about the poet. Although I had a brief encounter with her at Udaipur Literary Festival in India last year, which was impressive. Watching her at close quarters of her performance reading her poems and her unassuming and affable nature, I felt that Indian writers and poets should be noticed by us Lankans for the variety of talents flourishing there.
Paramita born in Bangla (West Bengal) now lives in Mumbai with her academic lawyer husband and upcoming young poet, her daughter. She is a scientist with a Ph.D. in Genetic Toxicology from the University of Calcutta.
A note on her reads: “she is now heling in the quality management of schools and junior colleges… More than 15 scientific papers in international and national journals”
As a rule I do not give an opinion on the content of a book of poetry because the poet has the right to say what he or she wants to say. Instead I pick up some lines in one’s poetry which I think are fresh and somewhat original in expression.
Here are some:
a What else, but you to vent out my anger when I am angry on the world, emotions to unfurl
a In this world of stone and grime, it’s nice to know that we each other could find
a In love, thoughts count…. The joy of life encompassed in love, has no end. Life ends, but love never ends.
a Were the clouds made up of gold? There was a streak of fire across the sky. The mesmerizing beauty made me sigh. The red sun was throwing its light on the clouds. The silhouette of the dark clouds behind, a greater beauty I am yet to find.
a The blending of colours, the cobalt blue, the golden and then the red. The ground was a dark bed. I loved flying up and up high. With the kites and eagles upon high. With no cares of the world. The mind was not in a swirl.
a Have you ever seen a dormant volcano? Fretting and fuming within but calm outside. Have you ever felt the pain of a dormant volcano? Full of molten lava inside, but calm outside. The red hot lava wants to be released. The bubbling liquid wants to come out. It knows not why it is trapped. It knows not why it is enwrapped. (Please read the rest of the lines in this poem)
a Being happy with little things is no vice
Finally I wish to quote in full the last poem in the book as it borders on the sublime realization
The golden rays of the Sun fell on the ground.
Sheets of gold spreading from the clouds.
A ring like radiance around your head was found.
Was it You that I saw coming out of the clouds?
A circling light in the sky.
A halo of light in the sky.
Was it You I found
I was awestruck and looked around.
The white clouds floating by.
The golden lined clouds in the sky.
I looked and looked in surprise.
Wait You in disguise?
