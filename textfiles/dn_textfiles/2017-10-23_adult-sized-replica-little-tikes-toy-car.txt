Adult sized replica of Little Tikes toy car

It may look like a toy, but this full size replica car is road legal and ready to tear up the streets of Toytown at up to 70mph.
Brothers John and Geoff Bitmead from Oxfordshire made the giant recreation of a Little Tikes Cozy Coupe out of an old Daewoo Matiz SE 0.8.
They say it took about 1,000 hours to make the vehicle, and it cost £4,000 - but ask any school kid and they’ll tell you it was worth every penny.
Unlike the foot-powered children’s version, this grown-up Coupe features a gas powered engine which can do 0-60 in 17 seconds and has a top speed of 70mph.
It can carry two adults and includes working headlights, mirrors, seat belts and even an airbag.
John and Geoff’s company, Attitude Autos specialises in bespoke cars which they rent out for TV and film productions. They hope to use the vehicle to raise money for children’s charities. Mirror
