NCE hosts sponsors

The NCE conducted a media launch on July 25, at the Grand Ballroom of Hilton Colombo, mainly to honour sponsoring partners of the event, and to brief the media and other invitees on the structure and changes introduced to this event of national significance in celebration of its 25th Silver Jubilee Anniversary.
The briefing was presided by Ravi Jayawardena, Vice President of the Chamber and the Chairman of the Export Awards Committee who made the introductory remarks. Thereafter, the President of the Chamber Ramal Jasinghe and Shiham Marikar, Secretary General / CEO of the Chamber addressed the gathering.Their addresses were followed by a presentation made by Januka Karunasena, CEO of Richard Peiris Natural Foams, the Most Outstanding Exporter last year, who outlined the value and benefits of the Export Awards to Exporters. Thereafter, the sponsorship packages were presented by the sponsors Mobitel (Main Sponsor), Bank of Ceylon, ANCL, NDB Bank, SLECIC, The Sri Lanka Tea Board, and the Hilton Colombo who have supported the event from the inception; the Union Bank, Expact Corrugated Cartons, Sanken (Pvt) Ltd., who have been sponsoring partners for the past five years; and South Asia Gateway Terminal (Pvt) Ltd., Colombo International Container Terminal (Pvt) Ltd., and Derana TV as new sponsoring partners.
Ramal Jasinghe in his address stated that as a major deviation, the Chamber has contracted the services of Ernest & Young the well known international Audit Firm to function as an independent Coordinator to provide professional inputs to the eminent panel of Judges, to further enhance the integrity of the event in the selection of Award winners.
The Panel of Judges for the selection of the final Awards winners will be headed by Ganaka Amarasinghe, a professional Accountant and Finance Director with immense experience in his own field, including as the Chairman of the Panel of Judges previously. He will be supported by others who are professionals and experts in their own fields related to exports. The panel of Judges will be supported by a second tier Technical Committee. as in the previous years, who will make the initial assessments of the applicants ,and present their findings to the panel of Judges for the selection of the final Awards winners.
Another major Change and a surprise as well this year, is that Awards winners will be announced at the event, and not previously as in the past, which will add an element of suspense, and drama to the event.
In keeping with modern trends the Chamber will assess applicants not only based on export performance, but several other aspects related to exports with due recognition being given to contributions made to Export Value Chains. In this context there will be opportunities for Small and Medium enterprises,and entities located in the Provinces as well, to showcase their achievements related to exports, for the economic development of the Country to achieve national targets, as expeditiously as possible, for the well-being of society.
Shiham Marikar the Secretary General / CEO in his address said that the NCE Awards which commenced in 1992 has been conducted without a break for the past 24 years to recognize and reward excellence in exports achieved by Sri Lankan Exporters of products and services, and service providers to exporters in the International Market place.
He further stated that the event has assumed National significance due to its professionalism and high standards,is the most looked forward to business event in Sri Lanka, and added that the 25th Anniversary this year will be celebrated with glitter and glamour,encompassing new features,and surprises.
