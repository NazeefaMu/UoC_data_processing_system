Special insurance scheme for school children

Many school children have received the benefits of the “Suraksha” Insurance Scheme introduced by Kurunegala District UNP Parliamentarian, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam and nearly 7 million rupees have been paid as insurance benefits to students by now.
About 2,246 insurance claims have been received by the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation during the past three months from school students countrywide and those claims are now under process of assessing for benefit payments.
All students who study at National Schools, provincial schools, private and international schools countrywide are now covered under this special insurance scheme, said Kurunegala District senior Director of Education W. M. Balasooriya speaking at a meeting of school heads of the Kurunegala District held at Wariyapola Teachers’ Resources centre, Kurunegala yesterday (11).
