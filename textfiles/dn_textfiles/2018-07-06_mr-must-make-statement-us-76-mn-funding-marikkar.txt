MR must make statement on US$ 7.6 mn funding - Marikkar

Colombo district UNP MP S.M. Marikkar said yesterday that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa should make a statement in Parliament on whether he received US$7.6 million from China Harbour Company for his election campaign in 2015.
Addressing a media briefing held in UNP Headquarters 'Sirikotha' yesterday, he said that Rajapaksa’s henchmen like Wimal Weerawansa should also say whether the former President received this money from China Harbour company or not.
Several associates of former President had issued death threats to two local media personnel for giving information to the New York Times.But, why former President would not sue the New York Times without threatening the media personnel.
"We also urge the journalists to report the truth in this regard without being scared of anyone. There are no restrictions on media freedom today while no journalists were killed, assaulted and made to disappear during the Yahapalanaya government.We will not allow this matter to be swept under the carpet due to the Vijayakala Maheswaran issue.
"We urge the President to appoint a Presidential Commission of Inquiry to probe this matter similar to the several Presidential Commissions he appointed to investigate bond scam and corruption in SriLankan Airlines.Apparently, the China harbour company has considered this bribe as an investment. They have added an interest too for this money.Unfortunately, it is the people of this country who have to bear this burden through taxes,” he added.
