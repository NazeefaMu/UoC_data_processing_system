Sri Lanka to send first nano satellite into space in 2020

 The Moratuwa Arthur C. Clarke Institute has now opened the doors for Sri Lanka to gain satellite technology know how by entering into an MOU with the Russian Federation Government through the good offices of the Sri Lankan government.
Director General of the Arthur C. Clarke Institute for New Technology Sanath Panawennage said following the MOU, the Samara Aeronautics University of Russia has agreed to provide Nano Satellite Technology and help Sri Lanka to station such satellites in space.
As the first step in this direction, a workshop was held in Sri Lanka by a team of Russian satellite scientists.
As the second stage, a selected 17-member group of Sri Lankan engineers visited Russia and gained first hand knowledge and information regarding Nano Satellite Technology. Accordingly, Sri Lanka would step into produce its first ever nano satellite in 2018. Thereafter, Sri Lanka will enter the satellite technology era by sending its first nano technology satellite into space in 2020.
Research scientist Samantha Pushpakumara of the Nano Satellite Project's Junior Group Leader said a nano satellite is a tiny electronic system about one to 10 kilogrammes in weight revolving round the earth in an attitude of about 400 to 500 kilometres. A nano satellite will have one to twelve units.
It can be used for communication photography, obtaining climatic data, as well as data needed in agricultural cultivation, tsunami warnings and receiving data on ship and boat positions. Nano satellites also cover areas inaccessible to bigger satellites.
The main units in a nano satellite includes, an electronic power supply subsystem, on board computer subsystem, a micro controller, an altitude determination and control subsystem, communication sub system (with UHF and VHF communication equipment) and a payload subsystem.
