‘Hajj encourages fellowship’

Muslims throughout the world celebrate Hajj as a holy pilgrimage undertaken as a sacred religious rite that recalls the sacrifice of Prophet Ibrahim, stated Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in a message marking Hajj.
The message added: "Hajj festival brings together the global community of Muslims, encouraging them to share a fellowship of compassion and love, empathy and co-existence, all of them exemplary qualities that the world can learn much from.
"At a time when spiritual guidance and values are needed in our society more than ever, Hajj would indeed be a time for reflection and unity not only for Muslims but for all citizens.
"May Muslims in Sri Lanka and the world enjoy and celebrate a meaningful Id-ul-Alha."
