‘The Wall of Humanity’

‘The Wall of Humanity’ of Ananda College, with a history going back six years, recently inaugurated a rehabilitation program at Upadhyaya Vidyalaya in Panadura. For one whole day, committee members from the club were involved in donating various items to the students from the school. These included two desktop personal computers and 250 parcels each containing four books and various stationery items.
‘The Wall of Humanity’, which seeks to go beyond the financial centrism of other clubs which organise social rehabilitation and various welfare projects, was commenced in September 2012, and has been thriving ever since. Currently, the President of the Club is Thaveesha Perera, while the Chairperson of this Project was Naveen de Silva. The Committee Members include Chamika Wijeratne, Dinuka Tharushan, and Nidula Rawindith. The Teacher in Charge of the Club is Mrs Kumari Udawattagama.
