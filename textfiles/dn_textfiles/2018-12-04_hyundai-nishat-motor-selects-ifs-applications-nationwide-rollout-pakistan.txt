Hyundai Nishat Motor selects IFS Applications for nationwide rollout in Pakistan

Hyundai Nishat Motor (Private) Limited will deploy IFS Applications™ 10 featuring robust, best-practice capabilities tailored for the automotive sector.
To empower staff and support the company’s long-term vision of becoming the most valued automobile brand in Pakistan, Hyundai Nishat Motors needed to implement a modern and comprehensive business platform.
The company selected IFS Applications based on the solution’s powerful capabilities for dealer management, including sales, service, spares and CRM, all tightly integrated with manufacturing, supply chain and finance.
The IFS industry solution will also help Hyundai Nishat Motors maintain optimum stock levels, keep records of past services and repairs, notify end-customers of future services, schedule and allocate workshop resources, and extract commercial insights related to prospects, sales staff, regions, models, and customer preferences. “We are delighted to work with an organization like IFS, which has a successful track record in supporting companies in the highly specialized automotive sector,” said Hassan Mansha, Chief Executive Officer, Hyundai Nishat Motors (Private) Limited. The implementation of IFS Applications 10 across Hyundai Nishat Motors’ own outlets and franchise dealers will be carried out with the help of IFS channel partner Millat.
S M Irfan Aqueel, CEO of Millat Tractors (Private) Limited, added, “This is the fourth sale/implementation of IFS in Pakistan in less than a year by the Millat IFS Business team, which is an achievement we are proud of. By combining the functional and technological capabilities of IFS Applications 10 with the service delivery potential of our team, we are sure to fulfil the customer’s stringent business and operational requirements.”
