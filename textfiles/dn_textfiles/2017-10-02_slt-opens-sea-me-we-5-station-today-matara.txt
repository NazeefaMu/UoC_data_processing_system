SLT opens SEA-ME-WE 5 station today in Matara

Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) will open the SEA-ME-WE 5 undersea cable system’s full landing station in Matara, today.
Landing this international cable at Matara will be a key milestone as well as a landmark for the telecom industry of Sri Lanka as well as the whole country.
This is a globe joint venture which is costing US 35 million and involving 14 other countries. The investment from Sri Lanka Telecom towards this joint venture would be Rs. 7 billion said Kumarasinghe Sirisena Chairman Sri Lanka Telecom.

He said several other regional countries wanted this landing station installed in their countries but due to professional approach by Sri Lanka Telecom and most importantly the location of Sri Lanka helped to secure this project for Sri Lanka.
The SEA-ME-WE 5 submarine cable system, spanning around 20,000 km, will offer a POP to POP solution from Singapore, all the way to Europe via France and Italy.
He said in addition to getting foreign exchange by providing services the project when fully loaded, the system would be able to carry 24 terabits per second; the equivalent of transmitting around 4,800 high-definition movies every second.
“This global project will have a positive impact on the overall growth of the country’s economy as high speed broadband environment will encourage higher GDP, enhanced exports, increased productivity, inward migration and modernizing of other sectors.”
“It would also be a major boost to government plans for digitalization, increase Wifi and also to increase computer literacy.”
“Due to these high speed Sri Lanka will be the most preferred destination in the region for BPO and Data Center operations.”
Sirisena said that in addition the SLT has also secured a deal to build operate and manage a cable depot in Galle.
“This would be a joint venture with a Singapore based cable ship company and they will utilize Galle harbor for their operations.”

SLT flags off South Asia’s first Submarine Cable Depot today
Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) will flag off South Asia’s first state-of-the-art Submarine Cable Depot project in Galle today as the company has been given the opportunity to build, operate and manage this venture.
SLT will operate this cable depot as “Galle Submarine Cable Depot Private Limited” (GSCDPL) with IOCPL (Indian Ocean Cableship Pte Limited) which is a ship service provider for SEAIOCMA (South East Asia & Indian Ocean Cable Maintenance Agreement). IOCPL is a Joint Venture Company of Singtel Singapore and Orange France.
Newly formed GSCDPL will be a depot service provider under the SEAIOCMA from 2018 January 1, onwards.
SEAIOCMA is the international consortium for maintaining the undersea cables.
“Through this operation in the South Asian region, SLT believes in the possibility of bringing in foreign currency to strengthen the country’s economy in the future, said Kumarasinghe Sirisena, Chairman Sri Lanka Telecom. Sri Lanka is an important destination where multiple cable systems are already in operation passing the country. Sri Lanka will be the only Submarine Cable Depot in the South Asian region.
“SEAIOCMA is an agreement among the telecom submarine cable operators, cable ship operators and cable depot operators for providing submarine cable maintenance spanning in an area between Djibouti in the west, Perth in the South, Guam in the East and the northern tip of Taiwan. Prior to this initiative, Singapore was overlooking the Submarine Cable Depot to facilitate international cable systems.
The Galle Port has been selected to set up a submarine cable depot by the cable consortium with the participation of a number of countries and Sri Lanka will facilitate the cable maintenance ship berth and warehouse facility.
“Due to this project the Galle harbour too would earn addition revenue offering various additional services for its ship which would be stationed there.” (SS)
