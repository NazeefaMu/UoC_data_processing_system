Dragging our kids back from the horrors of Heroin Hell!

Tuesday last, June 26 was the International Day ‘Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking’. This year the organisers observe the theme: ‘Listening to children and youth is the first step to help them grow healthy and safe’.
Given the increased incidence of drug abuse in youth and kids, it is important to listen to them first. This initiative aims at increasing support for science-based prevention of drug use and invests more on the well-being of children, youngsters and their families.
During the last two decades or so the Sri Lankan authorities have targeted the drug menace as a major threat to the country’s security. The issue has become the focus of public attention again following some of the biggest heroin detections in recent times by the Military and Police Narcotics Bureau. The International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking is an effort of the United Nations aimed at strengthening action and spreading awareness about drug abuse and illegal drug trade in the world.
It is an expression of determination towards the goal of achieving an international drug-free society, that organizations across the globe support this initiative which aims at increasing awareness about how major a problem drug abuse is. Last year’s theme was ‘Listen First’ - Listening to children and youth is the first step to help them grow healthy and safe.
Celebrated each year on June 26th, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime uses the commemorative day to highlight the dangers of drug use and their illegal trade and provides educational material to teachers and public officials all over the world to help spread the message about the extreme cultural and economic harm the trade in drugs is still doing across the globe one hundred years after the war on drugs was initially launched in Shanghai around the start of the 20th Century.
Fairly recent dope hauls at the Katunayake International Airport warrant serious concern especially since Bureau detectives believe that Sri Lanka is fast becoming a preferred transit hub of international drug syndicates, especially cocaine smugglers.
We now hear the distressing news by the Presidential Task Force on Drug Prevention last week which revealed that 13percent of schoolchildren island-wide, primarily those over 14 years of age, were addicts involved in some form of substance abuse.
Sri Lankan authorities responsible for the control of narcotics are finally admitting, albeit reluctantly, that the country is now a hotspot for trafficking drugs. Over the years, many anti narcotic organisations have identified the country as a transit point for drug trafficking, but the authorities have been reluctant to fully accept the fact.
However, several recent cocaine busts have put things more in perspective, says the National Dangerous Drugs and Devices Control Board (NDDCB)
In addition, complaints about drugs confiscated, as evidence in drug related offences ending up in the drug market again, has raised alarm bells within the authorities. Investigations have finally begun to determine where the loopholes are. Government agencies responsible for the controlling of drug trafficking and usage in the country are also unsure of the procedures followed to destroy court evidence.
While the incinerator which was set up to destroy confiscated drugs as per international standards remained out of order for some time, the Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) had simply just flushed the contraband drugs down the toilet.
Anti-drugs sleuths say the unprecedented rise in tourist arrivals had created a huge demand for cocaine, which is a popular opiate in the West. Cocaine is a powerfully addictive stimulant and its powdered hydrochloride salt form can be snorted or dissolved in water and then injected.
‘Crack’ is the street name given to the form of cocaine that has been processed to make a rock crystal, which, when heated, produces vapours that are smoked. The term ‘crack’ refers to the crackling sound produced by the rock as it is heated. The street value of a gram of cocaine, is estimated at around Rs 18,000 in Sri Lanka.
However, the widely used narcotic in Sri Lanka is cannabis followed by heroin. Last year some 29,700 addicts were arrested for using cannabis, 14,787 were arrested for using heroin while only four were caught for using cocaine and seven for hashish, according to PNB statistics. In detections made last year, 23 kilos of heroin, 10 kilos of cocaine, 18 kilos of hashish and 50,000 kilos of cannabis were taken into custody.
Until the mid 1980s, across the rest of the world like a plague. The first detection of heroin Sri Lanka had been spared the horrors of the drug menace when it was sweeping some two decades ago created quite a sensation in a country that had remained ‘clean’ in contrariety to its regional neighbours. Ever since, the police, Customs and several anti-drugs organisations had been pointing out that traffickers had been getting away with ridiculously light sentences, mostly fines, because of Sri Lanka’s then outdated drug laws.
The government in 1997 imposed the death penalty for drug traffickers found in possession of 15g of heroin or morphine, 200g of marijuana, or 1000g of opium. Lesser quantities meant prison terms ranging from several months to life imprisonment. None of this appears to have deterred the remunerative trade, which is backed by influential international combines, according to enforcement officials.
That is because the drugs industry for all its myriad risks is simple and highly profitable. Its simplicity makes it easy to organise. Its profitability makes it hard to stop. It has also skilfully responded to changing markets and transport routes.
At every level, its pricing and its structure are shaped by the high level of risk from enforcement and the risk of seizure and jail. The costs of seizure are small compared with the profits.
The country’s war against drugs has two fundamental objectives - to shut down supply and eliminate demand. But that seems a tall order even for the country’s specially trained elite cadres of customs officers, sniffer dogs and anti-narcotics agents. Despite several successful detections at the Colombo Airport, law-enforcement authorities concede that professional traffickers get the better of them most of the time.
The couriers seem to have devised ingenious means to slip through the barriers providing an uninterrupted supply. Sri Lankan officials are concerned that that as long as drugs keep on passing through Sri Lanka, they will continue to be a tantalizing temptation to the country’s youth.
Cracking down on ‘crack’ would be the only way for the administration to rid itself of ‘crackpot’ governance and saving our youth from ‘Heroin Hell’.
