Local industries will be protected - President

Foreign Investments cannot be allowed to impede and undermine local industries, President Maithripala Sirisena emphasised at a discussion on problems confronting the progress of the local industrial sector held at the Presidential Secretariat on March 5.
Pointing out that a correct economic policy would develop in a country only when the local business and industrial sectors were developed and strengthened, the President emphasised that he would take all decisions necessary for the protection of local industries.
He said strengthening of local industries was a pre-requisite in providing relief to the general public.
At this meeting a host of measures necessary to protect local industrialists and ensure their progress were discussed at length.
Attention was also drawn on strategies to be adopted to promote the local milk powder industry as well as the local biscuit and vehicle industries and threats posed to the indigenous medicine (Ayurveda) sector and measures to be taken to overcome them.
A press release by the Presidents Media Division said special attention was drawn at this discussion on threats posed to local businessmen as a result of granting approval for a foreign retail chain to engage in business in Sri Lanka and the President directed the BOI to desist from granting approval for any foreign investment which posed challenges to local industries.
The adverse effect caused on local industries due to a hike in bank interest rates came into special attention at this discussion and the President opined that discussions have already been held on measures to provide relief to local industrialists in the future.
The President who said that the contribution of both public and private sectors were vital in rebuilding the country's economy, assured that a committee comprising representatives of state institutions and local businessmen would be appointed to find solutions to the problems and questions raised during the discussion.
Ministers Malik Samarawickrema, Rishad Bathiudeen and Lakshman Kiriella, Finance Ministry Secretary Dr. R. H. S. Samaratunge, Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy and several other Ministry Secretaries were among those who attended this discussion.
