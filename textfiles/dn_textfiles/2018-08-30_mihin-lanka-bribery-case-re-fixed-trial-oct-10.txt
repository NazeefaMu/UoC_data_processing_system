Mihin Lanka bribery case re-fixed for trial on Oct. 10

The corruption case filed against former Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Mihin Lanka and former MP Sajin Vass Gunawardena for allegedly causing a loss of Rs. 883 million to Mihin Lanka Airlines while he was serving as its CEO was yesterday re-fixed for trial on October 10, by Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake.
Bribery Commission Assistant Director General Subhashini Siriwardena appeared on behalf of the Bribery Commission. Due to the absence of the defence counsel, the attorney-at-law appearing on behalf of Gunawardena asked for a date.
In this case, the Bribery Commission alleged that Gunawardena had entered into a three-year contract with a Singaporean company in September 2015 for the supply of ground handling equipment to the airline. The Commission had filed this case against Gunawardena under Section 70 of the Bribery Act.
