LAUGFS Lubricants rewards Roda Thunata Sawiyak winners

LAUGFS Lubricants, manufacturers of engine oil that suits the tropical environment of Sri Lanka, recently unveiled Actron brand Lubricant products designed specifically for two-stroke and four-stroke three-wheelers to further enhance engine performance through climate suitability.
At present, Actron is the only dedicated brand of engine oil specifically designed for three-wheeler engines.
Actron 4T 20W-50 for four-stroke three-wheelers and Actron 2T for two-stroke three-wheelers offer enhanced engine performance and durability amongst a plethora of other advanced benefits.
Parallel to the introduction of the latest Lubricants to the market, LAUGFS Lubricants carried out “Roda Thunata Sawiyak”, a series of educational programmes to build awareness among three-wheeler drivers (four-stroke and two-stroke) about the products.
The educational programmes covered 50 cities in Colombo and suburbs while imparting valuable information to approximately 9,000 three-wheeler drivers. During the programme LAUGFS Lubricants selected 15 winners through a raffle draw and presented a year's worth of Actron engine oil to each lucky winner at a ceremony held at the LAUGFS Head Office Auditorium.
“The latest Actron products were developed at our state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities in Malwatta following extensive research and development into climate suitability and efficiency.
