Farmer insurance, a top priority – Minister

The present government has given high priority to the protection of local farmers and we have kept on improving their insurance coverage to give them maximum benefit, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
He was the chief guest at the inauguration of the World Bank workshop on index-based insurance held yesterday at Shangri-La Hotel, Colombo.
The Minister said that farmers often fall victim to natural disasters such as flood, drought and various other disasters. These natural disasters destroy and damage crops that they have carefully looked after. As a result of long spells of drought, farmers are unable to undertake cultivation.
“These extreme weather conditions reflecting climate change require that government authorities and the policymakers pay greater attention to improving ways and means of providing relief and redress to those thus affected,” the Minister said.
In addition to the adverse impacts on the farmers brought about by natural disasters, low market prices arising from gluts in local production also pave the way for depressed farmer incomes and loss of livelihoods. As a result, most countries have adopted crop insurance in various forms, he added.
Minister Amaraweera also said that Sri Lanka has had a fairly long history of agricultural or crop insurance. Starting with a pilot project to provide insurance coverage to paddy farmers, Sri Lanka enacted the Agriculture Insurance Law in 1973 under which the Agricultural Insurance Board was set up. The Agriculture and Agrarian Insurance Board was established in 1999 under Act No 20, and insurance cover has been provided for a series of agricultural activities and crops.
“In May this year, we made arrangements to provide insurance coverage for six crops which include paddy, maize, chillies, soya bean, big onions and potatoes. The most important feature of this scheme is that the full insurance premium is paid by the government without burdening farmers. This way, the government aims at ensuring that the farmers concerned will continue with cultivation of these important crops, without any fear of heavy losses in income,” said the Minister.
He further said that there are many more measures that need to be taken to ensure that crop insurance schemes address the critical issues facing vulnerable farmers.
“We need to take prompt action to provide redress in the case of disasters and take fair and objective decisions in providing timely compensation,” he added.
He further added that the index-based scheme now used in several countries, is a more efficient and a cost-effective system.
“But we need to make whatever modifications necessary to suit our country’s needs. I am sure that this system will help us to provide a better service and speedy relief to our farmer communities in a transparent manner,” the Minister added.
Deputy Agriculture Minister Angajan Ramanathan, Ministry Secretary B. Wijeratne, Agriculture and Agrarian Insurance Board Chairman S. Wirithamulla, and World Bank’s International Finance Cooperation (IFC) Country Manager Ameena Ariff also participated in the event.
