Nalanda wins 11th Maroons Battle in the UAE

Old Nalandians continued their winning streak over Anandians, knocking the traditional rivals out of the 11th Battle of the Maroons in the UAE, and clinched both P de S Kularatne Memorial Trophy and Lionel Mendis Memorial Trophy.
The 11th Battle of the Maroons in the UAE was jointly organised by Ananda College Old Boys’ Association (ACOBA) UAE Wing and Nalanda College Alumni (NCA) UAE to embark on the traditional fellowship.It was held on 2nd November 2018 at the Eden Gardens Cricket grounds in Ajman.
Old Anandians batted first and posted a commanding total of 151 for the loss of 5 wickets in their allotted 20 overs with Ananda Captain all-rounder Achinda Witharamalage top scoring with a well calculated 54 runs in 29 balls. Achinda was well supported by Yasitha, who contributed 31 runs and put on a formidable partnership for the 5th wicket. For Nalanda, Ranga Kalyanaratne was the pick of the bowlers accounting for 2 wickets giving away 24 runs in his allotted 4 overs. Kavinda took 2 for 29.
Early wicket
Chasing 152 for victory, Nalanda started their innings badly when Madura was out in the first ball of the innings. Because of the early wicket Nalanda had to be extra cautious, and the run rate was extremely slow in the first few overs. add to that Yasas was out in the first ball of 3rdover which was Tharindu’s second over, caught behind again for 1 run. The score at the time was 1 run for the loss of 2 wickets. In came Nalanda Captain Namal to join Arunalu and they began rebuilding the innings cautiously. Arunalu was the next to go when the score was at just 50runs in 10 overs. Kavinda was the next batsman, who provided good support to Namal, who at the other end was batting nicely.
Kavinda was unfortunately out LBW when he was at 11 and the score at 71 in the 13th over. Nalanda’s veteran cricketer and coach, Viraj joined Namal and continued to build the score with cautious batting. Namal on the other end was building his score and reached his half century with a scintillating boundary. Nalanda scoring rate was slow when they reached the 100 run mark which happened in the 16th over. However, with Namal timing the ball sweetly, the target was always at sight. He made sure to keep his wicket till last over as he knew it’s his responsibility to take them over the line.
In the 17th over, with the help of couple of wides and poor deliveries they managed to score 19 runs.
Whilst Viraj was out for 11, next batsman Asanka provided sufficient support to Namal, who finished the match with a boundary off 2nd ball of the last over. Namal remained unbeaten at 90 and all celebrations began of a hard-fought win for Nalanda.
Scores:
Old Anandians: 151 for 5 in 20 overs (Achinda 54 not out, Yasitha 31 not out, Thakshitha 17,Nimesha 16, Ranga 2 for 24 and Kavinda 2 for 29)

Earlier in the day Old Nalandian’s second XI team led by Sandun Kosala outplayed Old Anandians second XI team and won the Lionel Mendis challenge trophy for the 3rd consecutive year. Nalanda Skipper Sandun Kosala won the toss and elected to bat first.
Nalanda openers started brilliantly and reached 100 runs in the 11th over. Nalanda veteran Diptha Premasinghe was the top scorer with a well-paced inning of 57 runs off 3 deliveries.
Last year batting hero Chanaka Senathilake also batted well reaching his 50 off 48 balls. Whilst Nalanda was headed for a big score, with the introduction of Aruna Ratnaweera’s left arm spin, quick wickets resulted in Ananda restricting Nalanda to 147 for 7 in their allotted 20 overs. Aruna bowled well to take 5 wickets for 22 runs in his 4 overs.
Ananda in their run chase lost wickets at regular intervals as Nalanda bowlers were tight in their line and length.
Top scorers for Ananda were Dhanuka Prageeth 18, Nipuna 14, Shalin 14. The asking rate was so high, Ananda managed to get only 104 runs for the loss of 9 wickets in their allotted 20 overs.
