Estate workers’ strike cripples tea trade

The tea estate workers in the hill country continue with their strike demanding a Rs. 1,000 wage increment.
CWC President Arumugan Thondaman MP called for a full-fledged strike on Tuesday after many rounds of talks with plantation companies which proved futile.
The strike crippled many estates in the Hatton, Talawakelle, Bogawantalawa and Maskeliya regions.
