Dengue fever is on the rise in the Addalaichenai DS division, Addalaichenai Medical Officer of Health Dr. A.L.M. Alawdeen said.
Over 26 dengue cases were reported from the Addalaichenai areas so far this year.
A 36 year-old women, mother of four in Addalaichenai division No. 4, died of dengue last Wednesday.
A door to door awareness campaign was initiated to educate the public about preventive measures.
The MOH has requested all department heads; government, non government, principals, and local authorities to pay much attention to eradicate dengue breeding spots in their departmental premises by keeping them clean and tidy.
Anyone suffers from fever more than two days should seek treatment from a state hospital or from a qualified doctor, health officials warn.
No drug other than Paracetamol should be taken, they said.
