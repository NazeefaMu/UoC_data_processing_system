Office train stalls after hitting herd of cattle

The morning office train No 855 to Moratuwa which left Chilaw station at 4.20 a.m. yesterday damaged its vaccum pipe when it hit a herd of four cattle loitering on the track at Maikkulama. Five other scheduled trains were delayed as it was stalled for a few hours until steps were taken to tow it back to the Chilaw station.
A railway spokesman said steps were underway until noon yesterday to repair the damage and bring the train back to operation. Chilaw Police said the cattle belonged to a dairy owned by a prominent individual in the area.
The Chilaw UC had also been informed about the problem of cattle straying into the rail track but steps had not been taken to prevent this so far. It the Council took steps to round up stray cattle, police security could be provided for the operation.
