Proposal to hold SLFP May Day rally in Batticaloa

It has been proposed to hold the SLFP May Day rally in Batticaloa, Ports Authority Sri Lanka Nidahas Sevaka Sangamaya President Prasanna Kalutarage said.
Speaking to the media at the SLFP Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said they are ready to join with the SLFP leader and President Maithripala Sirisena to hold a massive May Day rally in Batticaloa.
“The idea to hold it in Batticaloa, where the SLFP won the recent Local Government elections, is yet to be approved, but we believe it is a good idea as it sends out a positive message for national unity,” he said.
Representatives of Sri Lanka Nidahas Sevaka Sangamaya branches of Ports Authority, People’s Bank, Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and Government Midwifery Service Association, who addressed the press conference, collectively said they do not agree to the decision by Sri Lanka Nidahas Sevaka Sangamaya General Secretary Leslie Devendra to be independent. “It was an arbitrary decision of Secretary Devendra. Not even the President had been aware of this decision.
“We have no reason to follow Devendra, and we firmly support the SLFP. We will attend the May Day rally of the SLFP on May 7,” they said.
“It is an illusion to think that the votes cast for SLPP are votes against the SLFP. People voted for the SLPP because they had no alternative,” said Kalutarage.
