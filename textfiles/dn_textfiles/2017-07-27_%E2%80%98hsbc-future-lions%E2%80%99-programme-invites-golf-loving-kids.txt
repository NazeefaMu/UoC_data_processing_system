‘HSBC Future Lions’ programme invites golf loving kids

HSBC together with the Sri Lanka Golf Union will conduct the ‘HSBC Future Lions’ grass root Golf programme from 1-5 August 2017. The programme is organized on the sidelines of the first ever HSBC International Junior Golf Championship between Sri Lanka, Pakistan, India and Bangladesh.
The ‘HSBC Future Lions’ grass root programme is open to kids between 8–13 years of age across Sri Lanka, who are keen to learn the game of golf.
Registrations are currently open and interested parents and schools can call Duminda on 0714-327343 at the Sri Lanka Golf Union to register for any location convenient for them.
The HSBC ‘Future Lions’ grass root programme will be conducted in four locations, namely Colombo–Aqua Golf driving range in Welisara, Anuradhapura – Eagles’ Heritage Golf Club, Victoria Golf & Country Club Digana, Kandy and Nuwara Eliya Golf Club. This programme will then culminate with the Junior Golf championship (Individual event) on 9 August and the much looked forward to HSBC International Junior Golf championship featuring national teams from four countries on 10 August.
Tharanga Gunasekera, Head of Marketing and Communications – HSBC stated, “As a global supporter of golf, we are extremely happy to have partnered with the Sri Lanka Golf Union to introduce a structured event in our endeavor to promote the game to kids in Sri Lanka. We welcome our clients and all Sri Lankans who are interested in getting their children enrolled, to sign them up at any of the four locations across Sri Lanka.”
Anil Perera, a Class A Professional from the PGTCA of America who will be in charge of the grass root roll out said, “Our aim is to try and condition kids who have never played golf before to try and understand it through visuals that demonstrate the ‘Key Concepts’ that is grip, stance, posture and swing. There will also be a golf video shown and we are going to play a hole with instructors who are scratch golfers. All participating students will be positioned along the fairways while pros play the hole from the tee box to the green and show how to finish a game. This is what done in North America where children are taken through the process of conditioned by viewing tour professionals playing at PGA tournaments.”
There will be hitting stations set up where one group will be engaged in the full swing and the others will putt at the putting green with two instructors each at each station, enabling each child to hit about 10 golf balls. Given that some of these kids have never held a golf club before, they will be monitored and guided throughout the process.
Firaz Hameed, captain of the Nuwara Eliya Golf Club said, “We began our junior academy in 2014 with just six kids that has grown successfully with 220 children being enrolled to date. So by opening up the game to the local community in Nuwara Eliya, we are confident that the program will reach the next level.”
Chairperson of the Junior Sub Committee, Sri Lanka Golf Union, Niloo Jayatilake added, “It is indeed heartwarming to have had the unstinting support from all those who responded so spontaneously to promote at grass root level, a game in which Sri Lanka has the potential to one day perform on the global arena.
There now is a structure in place to unearth new talent and to truly develop and broad base the sport. The talent search in particular will no doubt take more than a few years to reap its full potential, but I am confident that judging by the overwhelming response received this year, the SLGU will have no difficulty in continuing with this format in the years to come.”
