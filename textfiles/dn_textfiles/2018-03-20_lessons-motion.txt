Lessons in motion

When you yawn, you open your mouth wide and take in a deep breath. In certain instances, you try your best not to open your mouth so wide. That struggle to keep the yawn unseen is a common experience. That mostly happens when you listen to a story that you cannot relate to yet. It could be a story so important, followed by an expressed purpose. But a yawn is inevitable if it does not appeal to you.
This is what bothered Wasantha Herath when he was a primary school teacher. He was not at ease with what the syllabus had to offer. The children took the lessons with yawns. Something had to be done to fix this, Herath contemplated in silence.
Fling the table
And then it occurred. The obstacle was right in front of the pupils: the teacher’s table. It occupied a massive space, which could have been brought into play more constructively. His sixth sense urged him to fling the teacher’s table, but he had to lie in wait.

Wasantha Herath initiated his career as a trained Primary teacher. The curiosity for creativity encouraged him to explore various teaching methods to keep the pupils from boredom – or at least tone it down. He focused on education techniques when he undertook studies on sociology and education for his postgraduate research. The techniques were mostly on uplifting the student-centred education system.
“We need to make the classroom an entertaining platform for the pupil. The space reserved for the teacher’s table could be used for something more constructive. So I converted that space into a theatre.”
The Department of Education was more impressed with the concept than Herath could imagine, but they did not offer a complete thumbs-up to getting rid of the teacher’s table. They proposed to move the table to a corner as an alternative. Then came the next question. What can you do in that space? It shall not be a traditional theatre. Space has to be utilized for a teaching-learning project as well.
That was Herath’s aim. He could have used that space for computer and multimedia. But then he wanted it to be a more aesthetic experience. Then it occurred to Herath that he should try out muppets and puppets. He initiated that project with two friends adept at making puppets. They made different kinds of muppets such as sock, string and stick puppets.
Positive reception
“Puppets and muppets are not actually different from each other. In a simple way, we can say that a muppet is actually a kind of puppet. Obviously, they have certain differences and that is why they are categorized separately. A puppet is a figure of an object, person, animal, bird, etc. The figures are not limited to a certain type or form or character. They are diverse. They are manipulated by a person called a puppeteer. Puppets are used to put up a puppetry show which is a very ancient form of theatre. Muppets, however, originated in 1954-55. They are also figures used to put up a show but the characters are limited,” elaborates Herath sounding reflective, inspired by awe.
Encouraged by the positive reception of Education Department, Wasantha Herath formulated a course to train teachers in teaching using muppets and puppets. Yet, the project came to a standstill in 2002 due to lack of resources. Herath then adopted a strategic approach.
“I realized that we have to work from something already available in the system. Then I reworked the system. I removed the teacher’s table to a corner. The teacher could stay anywhere. If he feels tired he can sit on the desk.”
If the teacher does his job happily and aesthetically that creates a conductive environment where the pupil gets the maximum. They get an opportunity to immerse in aesthetic sense and entertainment. It is quite contrary to what the teacher is engaged in right now: teaching the syllabus as it is.
“We cannot force the Government to stop the scholarship exam. But we can inject an aesthetic sense into the scholarship examination. Why can’t we teach the child in an enjoyable manner? I have now created muppets which I can transport by vehicles. Most educators encouraged me. They asked me not to give up.”
Creative teaching
Simple in structure, Herath made sure that the muppets could be used in many instances for teaching. He received invitations from countries such as South Korea to conduct workshops on creative teaching. The muppets and puppets play a vital role in enhancing the child’s conversation capacity.
“We can adopt new strategies to narrate traditional stories. Let the child come up with his own version of that famous story of the rabbit and the tortoise. Use the muppets and the child will naturally come up with his own version. Let them enter the characters. From there, we can move on to many aspects,” Herath elaborated.
And the good news is that the muppets and puppets could be made out of discarded items. The child is fond of motion. That is exactly why they are addicted to cartoons. If an adult wants to take the child away from cartoons, muppet is the best strategy, Herath suggests. The muppets are capable of anything under the sun.
“Sri Lanka spends only 10 percent on early childhood. I do not think any other country has such a low percentage allocated to early childhood. If Sri Lanka pays proper attention to early childhood, we would not experience many issues. Early childhood is a vital stage medically, psychologically and sociologically. It is like a clay pot. Once formed, you cannot introduce amendments.”
About 85 percent of the human body growth takes place under five years. The early childhood, according to Herath, is marked by three aspects: touch, talk and play. The child’s main job is to play, which enhances the cognitive abilities and capacities. They do not require any teaching. Playing offers the best teaching during the early childhood.
Herath’s meticulous research has earned him positions in various organizations such as World Bank and Asia-Pacific. Herath is currently the Deputy Director of Early Childhood Development Project of the World Bank.
