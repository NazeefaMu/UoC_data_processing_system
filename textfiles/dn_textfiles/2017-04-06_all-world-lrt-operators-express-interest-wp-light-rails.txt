All world LRT operators express interest in WP light rails

Almost all the world’s leading Light rail (LRT) operators in the world have responded to Expressions of Interests (EOI) called by Sri Lanka to build five light rail corridors in the Western Province.
Megapolis Development Minister Champika Ranawaka told the media at Water’s Edge that it was pleasing to note that they received 39 EOI applications from USA, China, Korea, Japan, Germany, UK and other countries to build these five corridors.
He said that one of the unique features of this project would be that the government will not spend a single cent towards these projects as they would be on a Private Public Partnership basis where the operator will build and maintain this for a certain period.
The Minister said they have decided to do away with the mono rail system and will adopt the LRT model.The first leg of the project will be implemented with Japanese aid and the project will cost US$ 6,000 million .
The Minister also said that the rail electrification process too will be done from Veyangoda to Panadura. “However I must say that as a Sri Lankan I am sad to note that this project was first suggested by renowned engineer D. J.Wimalasurendra who was the father of hydro power inSri Lanka.”
