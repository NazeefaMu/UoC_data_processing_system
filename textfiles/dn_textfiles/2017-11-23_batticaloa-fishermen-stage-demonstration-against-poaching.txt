Batticaloa fishermen stage demonstration against poaching

Batticaloa district fishermen staged a demonstration near the lighthouse in Palameenmadu, Batticaloa, spotlighting their rights and demanding their urgent needs on the occasion of World Fisheries Day on Tuesday.
They said the Good Governance government should increase the benefits that they have already granted the fishermen, and that during the inclement weather, the livelihood of the fishermen must be safeguarded.
They pointed out that farmers get relief during drought, but fishermen do not get any such benefits during rough weather.
They also complained that with the development of the tourism sector along the coastal belt, the activities of the fishermen are being restricted. Although fishermen in the Batticaloa Mukathuwaran area suffer loss of lives during November and December, no compensation is given, they added.
The fishermen held slogans saying; “Do not allow outside fishermen to fish in these areas, we can’t allow them to steal our seafood;” “Stop illegal fishing and do not steal our marine resources.”
A memorandum on their demands and grievances was handed over to Non-Governmental Organizations Consortium President Einayam S. Sivayoganathan.
