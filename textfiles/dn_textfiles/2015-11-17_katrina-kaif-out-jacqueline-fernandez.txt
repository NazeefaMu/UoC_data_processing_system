Katrina Kaif out, Jacqueline Fernandez in?

If rumours mills are to be believed, an English toiletry brand has ended its contract with Katrina Kaif and is considering signing Jacqueline Fernandez as its new ambassador.
A source says, "Katrina has been associated with this particular company for the last two years. But now, they want a fresh face to take their new campaign forward.
They approached Jacqueline recently on the basis of a popularity survey."
It is said that the Bahraini-Lankan actress has given her verbal approval to the company, but is yet to sign on the dotted lines.
While both actresses were unavailable for comment, a source close to Katrina denies the buzz and says, "She is the only ambassador for the brand in India and will continue to be part of it. No one is replacing her."
However, sources close to Jacqueline confirm the story partly: "Yes, she has indeed been approached, but we are not sure if she will replace Katrina or be signed as the face of another product under the same brand."
