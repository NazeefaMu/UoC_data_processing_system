Weerawansa granted bail

 
Colombo Fort Magistrate granted bail to National Freedom Front Leader Wimal Weerawansa today.
Weerawansa sought bail from the Court of Appeal on April 4 through a revision application.
The revision application was fixed for support today by Justice H.C.J. Madawala and this application was taken up before a two-judge-bench.
Weerawansa was arrested on January 10 for allegedly misusing 40 vehicles belonging to the State Engineering Corporation (SEC) while functioning as the Housing, Construction and Engineering Services Minister incurring a loss of Rs. 91 million to the government.
