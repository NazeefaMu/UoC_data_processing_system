Citizen's Mail

Issuance of defaced currency notes
I refer to the news item that was published in an English daily of June 19 captioned as “CBSL not to accept defaced currency notes from December” and wish to pen a few words in this regard. If this law is implemented, definitely the blind people and the senior citizens will be victimised.
Currently state banks and other commercial banks accept mutilated currency notes only from their customers subject to the paste-them-on-a-white-paper on which placing their signature and the account numbers so that the bank could debit the respective accounts when they were returned by the Central Bank for any reason.
I feel that banks have to make payment only from their sorted cash without taking daily collections for this purpose. The banks have to play a major role in this regard. They have to sort out the cash before they are sent to the Central Bank. If they do not execute this job properly, the circulation of defaced currency notes in the country is unavoidable. On the other hand, cash-counting machines, used by the banks, do not reject the defaced currency notes.
The customers who draw money from the banks, in large amounts, are not in a position to check them all one by one very carefully to make sure if they are in good condition.
I wish to state that the Central Bank should make awareness programmes in this regard before the new rule is implemented.
