Spice Girls trio to earn $14 million each for one-off gig

Spice Girls bandmates Mel B, Geri Horner and Emma Bunton will pick up $14 million (£10 million) each for a two-hour long performance, according to new reports. The girl group celebrated the 20th anniversary of its first single Wannabe earlier this summer (16), and Scary Spice, Ginger Spice, and Baby Spice have teamed up to stage a show to mark the occasion in London's Hyde Park next summer (17). Renamed GEM, they will perform without bandmates Victoria Beckham (Posh Spice) and Melanie Chisholm (Sporty Spice), who have refused to be part of the get together, but the fact that all five original members won't be part of the show hasn't stopped promoters and big sponsors throwing money at the three remaining Spice Girls.
Insiders now claim the singing trio will pocket $14 million each from the gig - that's over $100,000 (£74,000)-a-minute per person. “GEM may not have Posh and Sporty, but the commercial opportunities for the girls is still huge,” the source tells the New York Daily News. In addition to their huge one-off performance pay-out, executives at huge international companies are reportedly eager to provide sponsorship and endorsement deals ranging in the tens of millions to support the ‘nostalgia comeback’ the Spice Girls reunion will provide for fans around the world.
