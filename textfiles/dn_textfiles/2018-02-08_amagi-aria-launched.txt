Amagi -Aria launched

Amagi Hotels recently launched its new brand ‘Aria,’ a four-star hotel located alongside the Negombo lagoon. Tourism Development Minister John Amaratunga graced the occasion as the Chief Guest.
Amagi Aria serves as a dining destination for both residents and visitors. Amagi Aria is home to fine dining seafood restaurant aptly names Moyã, which takes its name from the Sinhalese term for the place where the lagoon meets the sea, an ideal representation for the restaurant that is designed around the succulent delicacies available in the seas around Sri Lanka. The Catamaran Restaurant offers guests an opportunity to experience cuisines from around the world, prepared to perfection by Amagi Aria’s team of skilled chefs. For private dining experiences, the Tree House can accommodate up to 15 guests and The Pontoon can accommodate up to 20 guests. Quiet evenings can be spent enjoying a variety of innovative and classic beverages on the Grand Lawn or Sunset Deck, which boasts spectacular vistas and glorious sunsets over the lagoon waters.
The hotel is also ideal for weddings, corporate and private events as it features versatile venues that can be set up to suit individual needs. The Banquet Hall consists of a unique two-tier setting with contemporary design. The expansive lagoon-front lawn and deck is complete with a breathtaking backdrop for any occasion.
