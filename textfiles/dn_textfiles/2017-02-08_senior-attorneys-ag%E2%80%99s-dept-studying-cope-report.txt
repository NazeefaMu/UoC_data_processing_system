Thereafter, the Commission would systematically attend to its work. The public would also be given an opportunity to give evidence before the Commission, he said.
A source attached to the Commission said reports regarding this issue ran into thousands of pages and they had to be studied with great attention and care.A decision regarding the hearing of public evidence would be taken thereafter and whether investigations would be done in public or confidentially depended on the discretion of the Commission.The Presidential Commission officially started work at its premises in the Justice Ministry building in Hulftsdorp, Colombo on February 6.
