We aim to be No 1 player in SL's smartphone market - Micromax VP

Micromax, the Indian consumer electronics company, strives to make a more noticeable impression in the Sri Lankan smartphone segment by introducing more and more smartphones which deliver tremendous value for money, said Sameer Kakar, Vice President and Head of International Business, Micromax.
“Sri Lanka is an exciting and critical market as far as Micromax's future growth targets are concerned. We were flabbergasted by the love and affection received from the Sri Lankan customers over the last five years. Having reached that position, we are now keen to make a more noticeable impression in Sri Lanka’s smartphone segment,” Kakar told Daily News Biz ICT.
According to Metropolitan, which is the authorized distributor of Micromax phones in Sri Lanka, over three million Micromax mobile phone devices have been sold in the Sri Lankan market over the last five years, while the brand has managed to secure a market share of around 20% in the mobile phone segment.
Kakar further added that the company doesn’t have definite plans to launch wearables in the near future.
Commenting on the local mobile phone industry, Kakar mentioned that consumer demand for mobile phones is growing at double digit numbers. Nevertheless, the overall smartphone penetration is still very low. "I think as a mobile device manufacturer, we have a very important role to play in attracting more and more customers into this segment."
“This is the reason why we want to bring more and more smartphones which deliver tremendous value for money consumers and then more customers can migrate from feature phones to smartphones.
"Furthermore, Micromax has received good reviews and response from customers following the launch of Micromax tablets in Sri Lanka. However, the market is quite small as far as our sales are concerned.”
Going forward, Micromax intends to introduce a wide range of products including tablets which would fit the requirements of Sri Lankan customers.
Micromax holds the second position in the overall mobile phone industry and has secured the first place in the feature phone segment and it is among the top four brands in the smartphone category.
“In the smartphone category, Micromax is in the top four brands and we would love to be in the top three and two; ultimately to be the number one player in this market.”
According to latest available data, Micromax has up to now sold 140 million plus devices over the world.
