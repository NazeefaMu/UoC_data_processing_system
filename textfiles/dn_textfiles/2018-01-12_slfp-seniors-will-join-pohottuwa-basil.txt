SLFP seniors will join Pohottuwa: Basil

Several Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) seniors will join the Pohottuwa, SLPP, prior to the local Government election, former minister Basil Rajapaksa said.
He was addressing a press conference held by the SLPP at its Battaramulla office.
He said members of SLFP, UNP, JVP and other political parties had joined the SLPP. “The SLPP wins the LG polls and a mass exodus from the SLFP to the SLPP will followed then,” he said.
He said surveys reported that the SLPP would win seven provinces - 70 percent of local authorities, he said,
