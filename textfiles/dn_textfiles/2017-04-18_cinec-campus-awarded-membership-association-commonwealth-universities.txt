The Association of Commonwealth Universities (ACU) is a professional association for those working in higher education across the Commonwealth, providing avenues for collaboration and cooperation between its members.
They provide academic research and leadership on issues in the sector and promotes inter-university cooperation and the sharing of good practices.
Currently, members of ACU include some of the most prestigious Universities in the world such as University of Cambridge, University of Oxford, University of London and National University of Singapore.
CINEC Campus now joins this fold of distinguished educational institutes by gaining the prestigious ACU membership, awarded recently, for their highly qualified staff, high quality standards, research based culture and outstanding student support.
By being one of the members of ACU, CINEC will not only get global visibility but also be able to access various benefits such as sharing experiences, explore ideas and discover potential avenues for collaboration with key stakeholders in the field of higher education.
