SLFP National Youth Convention on April 2

The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) National Youth Convention will be held on a grand scale at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium on April 2 after a lapse of 13 years under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena.
Addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, the SLFP Youth Front Chairman Shantha Bandara said the convention will aim to resolve the 10 major issues faced by the youth.
“We conducted an island-wide research and identified main problems faced by the youth in Sri Lanka for last two years. Most of these issues will be resolved on April 2. The SLFP Youth Front has been at the forefront in giving guidance for the future of the youth and resolving their problems,” the Chairman said.
“We do not need youth insurgences. Many young lives were destroyed in the 77, 88 and 89 insurgencies and also in the northern war. Who is responsible for those deaths? Has the country benefited from them and the destructions?, he queried.
Students will be enrolled through interviews on April 8 to the the Political Science College, which will be started soon.
Young people in the age group of 18 and 35 can enrol in the college without any political bias, he said.
Commenting on the media reports on insufficient security for the Commissioners appointed to probe bond issue, he said that the President should take measures to provide adequate security to the Commissioners probing the bond issue.
He said the Commissioners should be allowed to hold an inquiry impartially without any interferences. “We will soon be able to know who robbed the poor people’s money,” he said.
