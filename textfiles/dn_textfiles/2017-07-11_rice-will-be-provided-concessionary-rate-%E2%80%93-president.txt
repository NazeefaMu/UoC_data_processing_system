Rice will be provided at concessionary rate – President

President Maithripala Sirisena says the Government will take steps to provide rice at a concessionary rate to the public by importing rice from other countries if the price of rice goes up further in the local market, as the paddy production decreased due to the recent droughts.
He was addressing a ceremony held in the Polonnaruwa district yesterday
The President recalled an article published in a national newspaper that the heads of the government cannot see the increased prices of rice. He said that as a leader who came from an ordinary family, and who knows the suffering of the people, he always acts according to these experiences and he is never ready to allow people in the country to starve.
There is a transformational change taking place in many fields in the country, including social, economic and political spheres under the present Government and the President said whatever challenges he has to face he will take forward this procedure with commitment.
President Sirisena vested the Janadhipathi Adarsha Primary School, built in Palugasdamana, Polonnaruwa with the students.
“Performing to provide similar educational rights to the children in all areas in the country, including the North Central provinces, is one of the major plans of the current government,” he said. The President stated that earlier the Janadhipathi schools were limited only to a few areas of the country.
The President opened the school by unveiling the plaque, undertook an observation tour of the school. He also launched the official website of the school.
President Sirisena presented a certificate to Student Vishmanie Manuththara, who demonstrated skills in the 2017 Provincial Drawing Competition.
North Central Province Chief Minister Peshala Jayarathne, State Ministers Vasantha Senanayake, and Sampath Sri Nilantha, and Principal Priyanga de Silva participated.
