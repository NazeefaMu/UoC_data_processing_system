'Impressive 12% of Indian pilots are women'

Heard about Avani Chaturvedi —the first Indian woman fighter pilot?” is how Air India’s Captain Kshamata Bajpai begins her conversation, reflecting her passion for flying.
The 50-year-old has been flying commercial planes with Air India for two decades and is the first captain to command an aircraft with an all-woman crew on the longest direct flight from Delhi to San Francisco.
Bajpai discovered her passion for flying serendipitously when she enrolled herself into National Cadet Corps Air Wing while in college. It took her some time to convince her parents as commercial flying wasn’t the most obvious profession for women back in the day.
Flying since 1997 She became the first captain to command an aircraft with an all-woman crew on the longest direct flight from Delhi to San Francisco
Nivedita Bhasin was the only woman in her batch of 20 at the Flying Club in Bihar in 1981. “I was treated like an outsider. Some took time to get used to the idea of a woman pilot, others took it as a challenge to ensure I don’t achieve what I set out to,” recalls the 52-year-old Allahabad-born and Delhi-based captain of Air India. A year after joining the airline (then Indian Airlines), she didn’t know how to broach the topic of her 4-month pregnancy with her male instructor because there was no formal maternity leave policy for pilots in India until 1987.
Flying since 1984 third female pilot to join Indian Airlines, was Nivedita Bhasin who paved the way for the airline’s maternity leave policy formulation in 1987. At 26, she became the youngest woman pilot in the world to fly a jet aircraft in 1990. Her son and daughter are captains in Air India and Indigo respectively
Bhasin changed that and went on to become the youngest woman pilot in the world to fly a jet aircraft in 1990. Much has changed since Bajpai and Bhasin’s era of struggle. Today, 12% of India’s over 10,000 commercial pilots are women. It’s among the highest percentage in the world and significantly better than the global average of 5.4%.
Even inside the cockpit, your gender does not affect your growth prospects because everything is driven by the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), says Captain Anushree Verma. The 32-year-old has been a commercial pilot with SpiceJet since 2010.
She feels it’s not the people in aviation but the world outside that still can’t fathom how a woman can command an aircraft. “Be it a cab driver or a passenger who spots you at the airport or inside the plane - if you’re a woman in a uniform, they assume you’re a crew member or a co-pilot; you can’t possibly be the Pilot-in-Command (PIC),” she says.
Flying since 2003 A small-town girl from Punjab’s SAS Nagar district, Captain Jaswinder Kaur, (35, Air Asia) spent four years travelling 135 km every day from Kharar town to Karnal in Punjab Roadways buses just to get her CPL (commercial pilot Licence). Started her aviation career with Air Deccan and was with GoAir before joining AirAsia. She had a brief stint with Kingfisher Airlines and is still cross about the several lakhs in salary that it owes her.
