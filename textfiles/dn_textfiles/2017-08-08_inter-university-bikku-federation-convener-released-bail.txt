Inter-University Bikku Federation Convener released on bail

 
Inter-University Bhikku Federation (IUBF) Convenor Ven. Tampitiye Sugathananda Thera, arrested on charges of causing damage to public property by forcibly entering the premises of the Ministry of Health during an anti-SAITM protest was ordered to be released on bail by Colombo High Court, today.
The Colombo High Court Judge Manilal Waidyatilleke made this order taking into consideration a revision application filed on behalf of the suspect challenging Maligakanda Magistrate’s Court decision not to granting of bail.
Accordingly, the suspect was ordered to be released on a cash bail of Rs.10,000 with three sureties of Rs.500,000. 
While ordering the suspect to be released on bail, the High Court Judge observed that everyone including Bhikkus should obey and respect to the law. "The Bhikkus should behave in an exemplary manner to the society without causing disturbance to public and damaging public property”, the High Court Judge said.
Defence counsel appearing on behalf of Sugathananda Thera moved Court that his client be released on bail since he was in remand custody over a month. The Attorney General did not raise objections to release the suspect on bail. 
A revision application filed by Inter-University Students' Federation (IUSF) Convener Lahiru Weerasekera is to be heard tomorrow.
The suspects were charged under the Public Property Act. 
Senior State Counsel Janaka Bandara appeared for the Attorney General. Counsel Gamini Alwis appeared for the suspect-petitioner.
