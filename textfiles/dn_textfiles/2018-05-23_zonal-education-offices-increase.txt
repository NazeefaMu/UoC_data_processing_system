Zonal Education Offices to increase

The number of Zonal Education Offices in the country will be increased from 98 to 200 shortly with the objective of streamlining administrative work in the field of education.
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam disclosed this when he opened a new technological laboratory building at the Trincomalee Nalanda Vidyalaya, recently.
The Minister said steps would also be taken to create a teacher pool in respect of each education zone in order to drive efficiency into the education system.
He said steps would also be taken to introduce a new modest and healthy uniform for pregnant teachers.
