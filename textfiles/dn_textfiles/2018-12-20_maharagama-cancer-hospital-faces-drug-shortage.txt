Maharagama Cancer Hospital faces drug shortage

Thousands of patients are in a quandary as the Maharagama Cancer Hospital–the only dedicated, public cancer treatment facility in the Western province is facing a severe shortage of essential and life-saving drugs.
The hospital authorities request for urgent assistance for essential drug supplies during the past two months are said to have fallen on deaf ears.
A large number of cancer patients who turn up at the hospital for these life-saving drugs have returned empty handed, sources said.
It is reported that some of these cancer treatment drugs are not available in private pharmacies and also needy patients are not in a position to buy them even if they are available due to the high cost.
When queried, the Director of the hospital admitted there was a shortage of drugs and his staff was doing their utmost to manage the existing stocks in an efficient manner. He said the matter will be raised at a meeting at the health ministry today and added that he was confident the issue can be sorted out.
Meanwhile, Director of the Medicinal Drugs Supply Unit Dr.Lal Panapitiya said due to payment delays the drug suppliers have stopped supplying some essential medicinal drugs.
He said due to recent issues there was a delay in getting approval for the payments for drug supplies.
