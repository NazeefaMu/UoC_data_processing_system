Buddhist Affairs Min. orders those misusing Buddhism arrested

Some voluntary organisations, business firms and leading individuals who pose as genuine philanthropists are reported to have started collecting funds for organising dansals and pandols from pious common people countrywide to mark the Vesak Festival -2017 which falls on May 10.
Consequently, the Department of Buddhist Affairs has informed all District and Divisional Secretaries countrywide to be on the alert and arrest the persons who misuse Buddhism for earning money. New rules and regulations have been introduced by the Department of Buddhist Affairs to be followed by Dansal organisers and all Grama Niladhari and incumbents of Buddhist temples countrywide have been instructed not to allow these organisers to misuse the Buddhist Flag to halt passers by to partake in meals and refreshments offered by Dansals.
W. E. Jayathilake, former Divisional Secretary for Bingiriya in Kurunegala made these comments to the Daily News.
