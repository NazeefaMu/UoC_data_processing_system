Four treasure hunters nabbed in Sigiriya

Four suspects were arrested by officers of the Sigiriya Wild Office while the suspects were digging for a treasure at Ilukwala in the Sigiriya Sanctuary in the night of March 8.
This followed after receiving information that a group of treasure hunters had dug a 15 feet deep hole and were ready to do some rock blasting to search for a gold deposit.
The officers said two other suspects had escaped during the raid. Those arrested along with a three wheeler, their implements and offerings were residents of Sigiriya and Kurunegala. They produced before the Dambulla Magistrate.
