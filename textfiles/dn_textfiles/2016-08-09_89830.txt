‘Rustom’ will leave you thinking twice about the legal system

Akshay Kumar says his forthcoming movie ‘Rustom’ - based on the sensational K.M. Nanavati case of a Mumbai naval officer will make the audience think about the country’s legal system.
Q: The Rustom trailer has evoked a great response. Your response?
A: Gratitude is my biggest response. I knew I liked the film, I knew I found the concept interestingly gripping. But one never knows how the world will react to what I personally feel is intriguing and interesting.
Q: Are you happy with the response?
A: So far the response has been mirrored to my own emotions and that is one of the greatest feelings an actor can experience, a shared passion about one’s choices of projects is just so humbling that it makes you want to hug all your fans and thank them for sharing their eagerness in your work.
Q: While the trailer was released, you were away on a holiday. Do you regret missing out on the excitement for your film back home?
A: I would have regretted not being on holiday with my kids. I’ve made over 130 films, and luckily still counting. But I only get so many years to throw my kids in the pool and watch them marvel at the world before they become too big and too distant for me to impress.
Q: But didn’t you feel cut off from the pre-release excitement back home?
A: Thanks to Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg’s greatest inventions, they kept me connected to the world which made me feel like I was at home feeling the love and support as if I was only inches from everyone’s excitement.
Q: ‘Rustom’ is your first film on a crime of passion… It’s about a loving husband who murders his wife’s lover. How difficult was it for you to portray this man who loves his country and wife but is accused of murder by the law?
A: It was so thrilling for me to portray such a character, one who has nothing but love and patriotism in his heart. But a crime is a crime… This film will leave you thinking twice about the legal system, the action of mankind and the ability to do the right thing at the right time.
It’s one of those films that people will argue about on their way out of the theatres, questioning each other on what they would do, given the same circumstances and what would they have done if they were on ‘that jury’. Aisan Image
