Historic series win beckons if Lanka plays its cards right

Sri Lanka’s fourth visit to the Caribbean in 36 years as a Test-playing nation gives them a golden opportunity to record a historic maiden Test series win provided they play their cards right.
This current tour comes after a decade, the last tour having taken place in 2008 when Sri Lanka recorded their maiden Test win on Caribbean soil. God knows when the next tour to the calypso islands will be. By that time Sri Lanka will be without most of their stalwarts who would probably be retired by then.
Why we say this tour is the best chance to win a Test series in the West Indies is because Rangana Herath, who has figured in several famous Test wins for his country since the retirement of the great Muthiah Muralitharan in 2008 is now on his last legs. At 40 he is not getting any younger and with his dodgy knees this Caribbean tour will certainly be his last, and what better way than to bowl his country to a memorable series win.
The same goes with former captain Angelo Mathews. Although age is on his side (he is 31) his fitness has been of great concern to the national team. Like Herath, Mathews is also being monitored carefully and may not play the full three Tests against the West Indies although he is in the side purely as a batsman.
Needless to say Herath and Mathews are the two most experienced cricketers in the side their combined number of Tests totaling 161 which is only 37 Tests less than the rest of the squad put together.
West Indies cricket are not in a healthy state at the moment especially their Test team with iconic players like Chris Gayle, Dwayne Bravo, Kieron Pollard, Andre Russell having abandoned the established game for the fast bucks earned from lucrative T20 cricket around the world that has left their Test cricket the poorer so much so that they have sunk to ninth out of ten teams in the ICC Test Rankings.
West Indies cricket was not so badly placed when Sri Lanka toured there in 1997 and in 2003 with legendary batsman Brian Lara holding the fast sinking ship together with his extraordinary batting talent. In 1997 Sri Lanka lost the Test to West Indies by six wickets at St John’s Antigua with the batting crumbling to the pace of Curtly Ambrose who finished with eight wickets. Six years later it was another fast bowler Corey Collymore who destroyed the Lankan batting at Jamaica also with an eight-wicket match haul that included 7/57 in the second innings. But with Lara gone by 2008, Sri Lanka was able to make inroads into the once unbreakable fortress by winning a Test match on Caribbean soil when Mahela Jayawardene’s men turned tables on them at Providence, Guyana winning by 121 runs. Chaminda Vaas was the match winner running through the Windies batting with a bag of eight wickets. West Indies however hit back to level the series by winning the second Test.
The situation has not improved since then as West Indies’ current Test standing indicates but only sunk further which is why Sri Lanka stands a great chance to capitalize on this opportunity. It is easier said than done. One cannot write off the West Indies just because they are ranked low because at home they are quite a different proposition. Three years ago at Bridgetown – venue of the third Test against Sri Lanka (day-night) – West Indies stunned England with a five-wicket win to draw the three-Test series one-all. Mind you the England team captained by Alastair Cook comprised current players like James Anderson, Stuart Broad, Joe Root, Jos Buttler, Ben Stokes and Moeen Ali. Of the current West Indies Test squad named for the series against Sri Lanka skipper Jason Holder, Kraigg Brathwaite, Shannon Gabriel and Shai Hope are members of the team that beat England under wicket-keeper Denesh Ramdin’s leadership.
Last year although West Indies lost the three-Test series 2-1 to Pakistan, they managed to pull off a 106-run win at Bridgetown. Top performers for West Indies were Roston Chase (131), Shai Hope (90) and Shannon Gabriel (nine wickets). The West Indies strength in their bowling is pace with Gabriel, Kemar Roach, Miguel Cummins and Jason Holder spearing the attack with Devendra Bishoo being the solitary spinner. If the Lankan batters can counter this bowling and come up with challenging totals, they are not short of bowlers to win Test matches. Barring a 2-0 series defeat in India, Sri Lanka has had success in UAE (beating Pakistan 2-0) and in Bangladesh (winning 1-0) in their last three Test outings. A series win in the Caribbean would certainly improve their Test rankings from the current sixth – a position that is far better than in the other two shorter formats where they are ranked 8th and 9th.
