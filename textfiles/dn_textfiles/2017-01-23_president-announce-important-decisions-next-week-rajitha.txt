President to announce important decisions next week: Rajitha

Next week is crucial for Sri Lanka because President Maithripala Sirisena is about to announce several important decisions, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to the minister, private sector blood tests were banned for the patients in state hospitals since January 1, and the business mafia tried to sabotage it. Blood testing in the state sector has gone up by 50 percent now. He was addressing the gathering after distributing several items among various organisations using decentralised funds during a ceremony at the Kalutara District Secretariat.
“Recently the Tobacco Company announced that their sales and income has gone down by 45 percent. The Sri Lanka worked hard to control smoking without considering the tax money received from the industry," he said.
The minister said the President has already implemented several programmes to face the drought. Funds were issued to all District Secretaries. Water tanks and browsers were provided and more will be given soon.
