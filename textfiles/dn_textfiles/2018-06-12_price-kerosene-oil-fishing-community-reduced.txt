The Cabinet of Ministers approved to reduce the price of kerosene oil which is intended to be utilized by the fishing community from midnight today.
The colour of the subsidized kerose oil will differ from the usual pink colour for the ease of identification.
Fisheries Minister Wijitha Wijayamunu had further said that President Maithripala Sirisena gave instructions to take strict action against individuals who misuse the price subsidy granted for kerosene oil intended for the utility of the fishing community.
