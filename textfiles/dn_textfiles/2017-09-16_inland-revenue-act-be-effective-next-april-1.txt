Inland Revenue Act to be effective from next April 1

The Inland Revenue Act (IRA) will come into effect from April 1, 2018, the Finance Ministry issuing a press release said.
The release said the capital gain tax, remittance tax, withholding tax and Pay As You Earn (PAYE) tax which were scheduled to come into effect from October 2017, would come into effect in April next year.
The release said the decision was made to avoid complications arising from having to keep two sets of accounts to implement the Act in two ways. The new tax collection date was set by the Treasury, as advised by Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera. The minister said reports that new sectors would come under taxation were false and that the Inland Revenue Department, Trade unions and all parties in Parliament have been consulted and their suggestions included in the final Act.
He refuted reports that religious institutions, foreign remittances or the interest payments of senior citizens would be liable for tax.
Interest incomes on deposits of senior citizens have a tax exemption up to Rs. 125,000 per month. A senior citizen should own a deposit exceeding Rs.15 million to be liable to tax.
The new system has simplified the tax system and removed other concessions granted to various individuals and companies.
The release states that under the new IRA, the annual limit for exemptions of PAYE tax has been increased from Rs. 750,000 to Rs. 1.2 million, which frees a fragment of employees liable to PAYE from the new financial year.
Companies listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange and the profits from trading stocks are not liable to capital gains tax. EPF is not liable to tax under the new IRA. The new IRA has not imposed taxes on the service fees of hospitals. Private hospitals are liable to tax as companies.
This tax was increased from 12 to 28 percent of the profits a hospital makes at the end of the financial year.
This would not result in an increase of hospital charges on patients.
