[APPRECIATIONS - (25-06-2018)]

Prof. Laksiri Jayasuriya
Ardent egalitarian
Emeritus Professor Laksiri Jayasuriya, who was professor of Social Work and Social Policy at the University of Western Australia, passed away on April 20, 2018, in Perth. He was the founder of the Sociology Department at the University of Colombo and led an eminent career in the Australian academia, while contributing to government policy-making processes in areas such as multiculturalism, ethnic affairs, immigration and citizenship.
He nurtured cohorts of students under his care during his long career in Australia and continued to engage in scholarly activities and publishing after retirement. Professor Jayasuriya leaves behind beloved wife Rohini and two loving sons Kanishka and Pradeep, both professionals; one in the academic and the other in the medical field. His death was a great loss to his colleagues, relatives, friends and former students in Australia and Sri Lanka.
Laksiri was born on October 27, 1931, in Ceylon, during the British colonial period. He was the eldest in a family of three. His father was a prison medical doctor and mother was from a wealthy family. He received his primary and secondary school education at the Royal College, Colombo, from 1945 to 1951. It was then an institution that trained civil servants for the colonial government of Ceylon. He participated in the debating team at Royal College, which included figures such as Felix Dias Bandaranaike (later, Finance and Public Administration Minister) and Mervin de Silva (later, reputed journalist).
Following the trend at the time of the English-educated elites who sent their children for higher studies in Cambridge or Oxford, Laksiri also wanted to follow the same path. However, through an encounter with Professor A. P. Elkin (father of Peter Elkin, an English professor at the University of New England, Australia) during a visit to Colombo, the opportunity arose for Laksiri to go to Australia for tertiary studies. He proceeded to Sydney in 1951, to begin his Bachelor’s degree as a private student by a ship called
Himalaya and became a resident of the Wesley College.
In Sydney, he was with a cohort of students who occupied influential positions in Australia and overseas in later years (David Walker interview 2012). He studied for a Bachelor’s degree between 1951 and 1954 at the University of Sydney and later received a degree in Psychology (Hons.) in 1954, with first-class and the University Medal. Laksiri studied History, Psychology and Anthropology. After completing the degree in 1954, he was offered a teaching fellowship at the Department of Psychology during the same year, by the Sydney University. He was one of the first academically-trained psychologists in Sri Lanka. Laksiri was 23 years old at the time.
He had a left orientation and political consciousness despite his elite education from the Royal College days. Sri Lanka had a strong Trotskyite group at the time and he was influenced by their social ideology and political activities. In Sydney, he had a close relationship with David Ross, a senior student at Wesley and the son of a communist party trade unionist. Laksiri’s contemporaries included Hedley Bull who later became a professor of International Relations and Jim Wolfensohn who became the President of the World Bank.
His teacher Prof. W. M. O’Neil had a great influence on him in terms of ‘scholarship and academia than anyone else’ (David Walker interview 2012).Laksiri accepted a full-time, permanent academic appointment at the University of Ceylon, Peradeniya, in 1956. Having trained as a social psychologist, he joined the Sociology Department where at that time, included Ralph Pieris, Stanley Thambiah and Gannanth Obeyesekera, all of whom contributed and taught subjects such as sociology and anthropology overseas. At the time, the department was arguably the best within the Faculty of Arts; an institution that was well regarded in Asia. He influenced a generation of students at the University, some of whom went to make substantial contributions in the academic and political spheres.
The campus was a site of creative intellectual endeavour as well as of robust debate over academic and political issues. Laksiri built strong friendships with people such as K. N. Jayatilleke, Professor of Philosophy and J. E. Jayasuriya, Professor of Education. He was an active participant in the academic debates and was remembered fondly for his contributions by his colleagues and students.
Laksiri returned to the University of New South Wales, Sydney, in 1969, on a Leverhulme Fellowship and delivered lectures in the departments of Psychology and Social Work. This was after he spent time at Berkley University on a Fulbright Scholarship.
Laksiri was asked to give the prestigious guest of honour address on the sweeping victory of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) in 1970. This led to a productive series of publications on Sri Lankan elections until 2010 that covered broader social contexts. He published a book on the Changing Face of Sri Lanka’s Electoral Politics in 2012, nine years after his retirement.
Laksiri pursued a postgraduate study at the London School of Economics and Political Science between 1957 and 1960, securing a PhD in Social Psychology. In 1969, he became the foundation professor in the Sociology and Social Welfare Department at the University of Colombo and developed the academic programme particularly with a concern to analyse the emerging contemporary social challenges as well as policies. He later became Dean of the Faculty of Arts. He was particularly proud of contributing to establishing the workers' education programme at the Colombo University.
In 1974, Laksiri was appointed foundation professor of Social Work and Social Administration (later Social Work and Social Policy) at the University of Western Australia (UWA), Perth. He was the first Asian professor there and one of the first Asians to be appointed to a professorial position at an Australian University. During his academic career at UWA, he was the head of department (1971 to 1990) and the Centre of Asian Studies Director (1989 1992). Between 1970 and 1971, he was the Social Sciences Faculty's Dean.
He was a Fellow of the British Psychological Society and the Australian Academy of Social Sciences and was also an honorary member of the Australian Association of Social Workers. He became an Emeritus professor and a senior honorary research fellow at the same university in 1993, marking the end of his full-time teaching and research career. Between 1993 and 1994, he served in the capacity of a Senior Fellow of Development Studies at Edith Cowan University, Perth. Laksiri was never one to slow down. He continued his academic work after retirement in close-association with the University of Western Australia in an honorary capacity, until his health began to deteriorate. The energy and enthusiasm he showed for the subjects that he examined, was extraordinary. He was truly blessed with high intellect and a vast reservoir of knowledge covering both Eastern and Western social traditions and philosophies.
In the 1970's, 1980's and 1990's, Laksiri played an active role in various state and federal government advisory bodies and reviews in Australia, dealing with areas such as multicultural education, language services and ethnic affairs.
He was appointed to the Immigration Advisory Council by the Whitlam Labour government (1972 to 1975). During 1973 to 1975, he was on the Federal Government Committee on Community Relations as well as the Migrant Task Force of the West Australian Government. He was the chair of the National Advisory and Coordinating Committee on Multicultural Education (NACCME) (1984 to 1987) and the National Multicultural Advisory Council (NMAC) (1996 to 1997). Laksiri served on the Anti-Racism Reference Group of the West Australian Government from 2001 to 2007.
Those roles highlight some of the key points of his significant contributions to policy-making, review and advisory services. Through those roles, he elevated himself to be a spokesperson for the immigrant and ethnic communities whose needs and interests had to be looked after by way of effective government policies and programmes. He was one of the key architects of the multicultural policy in Australia. His policy and academic contributions emphasised the importance of a political concept called pluralistic citizenship involving political rights as opposed to the narrow and tokenistic concept of cultural diversity associated with cultural, linguistic or ethnic identity.
Laksiri’s Academic career at the University of Western Australia was highly productive in terms of teaching, supervision of postgraduate students, research and publications from 1971 to 1993. He was elected Fellow of the Australian Social Science Academy and later became a Fellow in the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia and The British Psychological Society. In recognition of his services, he received the Member of the Order of Australia Award from the Federal Government of Australia in 1984. In the 1980's and 1990's, Laksiri published papers and books on contemporary policy issues.
He co-edited a book on Legacies of White Australia focusing on race, culture and nation (2005) and another book titled Transforming a White Australia: Issues of Racism and Immigration (2012). There are a significant number of book chapters, monographs, journal articles and occasional papers to his credit. During his long and productive career, Laksiri also published books, monographs and articles focusing on Sri Lanka’s social development, as well as Welfarism and Politics (2000). The latter is a book used by postgraduate students researching on the way Sri Lanka turned away from a welfare state to a warfare state and the emergence of hybrid regimes that contained both democratic and authoritarian elements.
A significant part of his academic work examined issues of social policy and electoral politics in Sri Lanka. He was particularly interested in the way social policies helped to shape new patterns of class formation and conflict in Sri Lanka. His book Taking Social Development Seriously (2010) was a synopsis of many of his key ideas on those issues. He was interested and disappointed in the way neo-liberal policies over the last decades dismantled or impoverished some of those programmes. He had a keen interest in the electoral politics of Sri Lanka and analysed election results after national elections and published papers in 2001 and 2002.
In the latter stage of his life, Laksiri focused on Buddhist Philosophy, which his father also had shown a keen interest in. He published an article on Buddhist Humanism for the Asian Century in the International Journal of Buddhist Thought and Culture (2011) and a book titled Reflections on Buddhist Social Philosophy (2014). He was the founding President of the West Australian Buddhist Society.
Professor Jayasuriya’s published work is available online and his personal papers are now available through the National Library of Australia for those interested in the focus and depth of his academic work.
It is a fitting tribute to a tireless academic, an advocate of immigrant and ethnic rights, a policy advisor, humanist and influential figure in the Australian policy context. Condolence messages received from the WA Government as well as former and current ministers of Multicultural and Immigration Affairs reflect his standing in the Australian community.
He was a giver as one of his friends has remarked in the Guest Book maintained by the West Australian newspaper. He had a vision or concept of inclusive multicultural citizenship within a just and egalitarian society in both Australian and Sri Lanka. He was disappointed by recent shifts in politics in both countries, but he never lost hope in the struggle for a just, democratic and pluralistic society.
Laksiri's relatives, colleagues, friends and former students fondly remember him as an intellectual with roots in Sri Lanka as well as a humanist who carried strong academic credentials and high ethical standards.
May he rest in peace!

Kumarini Wickramasuriya
A steadfast soul
So many words of appreciation have been written about the incomparable and multi-faceted Kumi Wickramasuriya who touched the lives of many. She is an inspiration to people on so many different fronts. I count myself as one of the fortunate people who came to be part of her life. She was the closest friend of my mother-in-law, Neiliya Perera and besides his parents, the person who has known my husband, Milinda, the longest. She was there for his mother’s confinement, to help her out with her firstborn. The rare and special friendship of my mother-in-law and Kumi radiated its love and influence to all around them and made us all the stronger for it. I have long-cherished and admired Kumi, who has meant so much to all of us in our family.
It is hard to remember Kumi without thinking of her husband, Sena Wickramasuriya; renaissance man, doctor and deep-sea diver, who chose to live in Tangalle rather than Colombo. Sena was equally at ease with fisherfolk as with his peers and was a much-revered figure in Tangalle. He helped build the Tangalle fisheries harbour to the extent of carrying rocks and diving to inspect the site when he served as the Harbours Corporation Chairman in the early 1970's. Although Kumi carried many deep traditions and ties to her de Mel and Moratuwa heritage, after her marriage, Tangalle gradually became the new core of her life and purpose.
Milinda and I spent part of our honeymoon in Tangalle with Kumi and Sena. I still remember how Kumi had prepared an oil lamp for us and how charmed I was with their oasis in Tangalle replete with exotic fish aquariums everywhere, diving equipment, warm company, scintillating conversations, gourmet food and classical music, surrounded by Kumi’s exquisite garden and the aromas from her famous kitchen floating in the air. She also created a special cake for us on our first wedding anniversary which she donned the Mimosa. At that time, Kumi was commuting between Tangalle and Colombo as a consultant to the Maliban top shelf bakery, putting her culinary skills to good use. Kumi was talented in all she touched and brought so much beauty and genuine joy to life in everything she did.
After Sena’s untimely death, Kumi’s world fell apart. Alone, a woman in a remote village far away from her closest family and friends in Colombo, she took the brave decision to remain in Tangalle. In Sena’s memory she embarked upon a venture that they had often spoken of starting. The organisation which she founded, aptly named Navajeevana, created new life not only for those it served, but also for Kumi. I still recall the difficult early days of Navajeevana as Kumi struggled to cope with the loss of her life partner, with her teenage son Arun to support through school and university and to adjust to her new status as a widow, founding a new enterprise with uncertain funding and little experience. I recall and witnessed how she built up Navajeevana piece by piece. Like her many friends, family members and others she had inspired, we all supported her in various ways during that long road.
Disability at that time was a taboo subject in the village, even though Hambantota was the worst afflicted area due to high levels of malnutrition and the lack of resources and facilities. Kumi’s hands-on approach helped to gradually erase the stigma and bring disability out into the open.
In the early days of Navajeevana, Kumi herself made field trips to remote areas of Tangalle to visit the homes of the disabled. Some of those homes lay beyond paved roads and bus routes so that part of the distance could only be reached by foot. She hired and trained college graduates from the area, providing them with hard-to-find jobs and a purpose. Kumi, in her double-cab, was a common sight in remote areas of the Hambantota district and created quite a stir. She continued her work at the height of the troubles in the late 1980's, at a time when many non-governmental organisations (NGOs) fled Tangalle. Hers was the only one permitted to operate undisturbed.
Kumi always had a strong sense of service to others, an unwavering faith in God that sustained her throughout her life and a generous spirit. Even in the most difficult of times, her faith prevailed. She often serenely remarked in wonder that someone above was looking after her. Strangely enough, small miracles seemed to occur from nowhere when she needed them the most.
It is entirely due to Kumi that Navajeevana became an indispensable community focal point and resource centre as well as a source of pride for the community. When the 2004 Tsunami struck, Navajeevana was the obvious choice as the logistical base of operations for much of the aid work in Tangalle, as the organisation had strong ties with surrounding communities and the necessary logistical competence and experience. Many better-funded and well-paying international NGOs marvelled at what she was able to achieve on a shoe-string budget with her highly motivated and trained team.
Ironically, Navajeevana had been struggling to obtain enough funds to finance its ongoing programmes such as her preschools, weekly clinics, eye camps, training of volunteers, prosthetics workshop and widening her network of clients as foreign donors began to make drastic cuts on programme funding. However, after the Tsunami, with the increasing awareness and appreciation of its activities, everyone wanted to be a part of the inspiring story of Navajeevana and there was an influx of funds that helped tide over the organisation for some time and provided Kumi with the ability to implement programmes she had envisioned. She never sat back, but kept on devising new ways to expand Navajeevana’s reach.
It gave much joy to Kumi when Navajeevana was asked to design and build a disability-friendly housing scheme for fisherfolk whose houses had been destroyed in the Tsunami. Her talented architect niece, Amila de Mel, assisted Kumi in this venture. The housing scheme was held up as a model project by many local and international agencies. Always keen to encourage and empower the disabled and to find ways to bring about more public integration and awareness of disability issues, Kumi was thrilled when the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) approved of a project to set up a gift shop with local products made by the disabled as well as a tourist cafe fully manned by disabled persons at the Navajeevana headquarters.
After the end of the war, Navajeevana was drawn upon by the government to help train social workers from the North and the East.
It brought her great happiness and pride to see the hard-built knowledge and experience of Navajeevana reach beyond regional borders and the people she had trained over the years develop in competence to this high level. For many founders, it is hard to divorce yourself from your creation. However, Kumi was always balanced and responsible, knowing when to lead from the front and when to do so from behind. She let others take the credit.
Kumi was always full of new ideas and plans and had a big heart. Though it saddens me that she is no longer with us, I can only smile when I think of her, for she lived a full, meaningful and contented life, and was widely loved. One of Kumi’s greatest joys was to be able to take her granddaughter Ananya to spend time in Tangalle, last Christmas. Kumi’s legacy lives on in all her loved ones, her son Arun, his wife Kishani, her granddaughter Ananya, family members Ranjini, Amila, Hiran, Suresh and Aro, as well as her other family, friends and many others whose lives she had touched.

Mahinda Bandusena
Distinguished public servant
Mahinda Bandusena, a senior and distinguished public servant, passed away recently after a prolonged period of ill-health. What is noteworthy about the formative period of his career covering school and university, is the total reliance on the free education system and the enabling environment that it ushered.
A quintessentially village lad with practically no social props, he availed himself of the opportunities the free education system offered. He applied himself with extraordinary determination, short-circuiting the school calendar through double-promotions and commenced his university career at Peradeniya at a very young age. It is a tribute alike to his determination and innate abilities that he secured a place through a highly-competitive examination in the coveted Administrative Service.
Thereafter, he slowly but steadily advanced towards the summit of his service, serving as an Additional Defence Secretary, Industries Secretary and a Public Administration Secretary. He performed with such acceptance in this position that Minister Rathnasiri Wickremanayake, upon becoming Prime Minister, sought his services as the Prime Minister's Secretary. His career in the public service was crowned with the position of Ambassador of Sri Lanka to Israel. In every one of these positions, he gave of his best. The somewhat conducive political and administrative atmosphere that prevailed during this time, enabled him to do what is expected of an administrator, keeping political and other vultures at bay.
Although thoroughly immersed in the public service at such heights, he remained essentially a family man, ensuring that his two daughters and son ended up as medical and engineering professionals. He was singularly fortunate in the two sons-in-law and the daughter-in-law that joined his family. His wife Lalitha, his children and grandchildren sustained him especially during his unfortunate illness. The loving care with which his wife nursed him, administering a myriad of medications meticulously on time and ensuring hospital services of the highest level at frequent intervals, would stand out as a shining example of indefatigable wifely devotion and love.
It is to be hoped that his life as an administrator and family man would be an inspiration to others. May he attain the Supreme Bliss of Nirvana.
H. P. W.
