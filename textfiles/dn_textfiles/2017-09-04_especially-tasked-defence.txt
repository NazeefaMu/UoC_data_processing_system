Especially tasked for defence

In 1984 September, I have just returned to the island after undergoing specialized training in the UK (Hampshire) and qualified as a small arms officer.
September 1, 1984, was a Sunday. Most of us who were in the pistol shooting team proceeded to Kalutara Police College firing range every Sunday morning from FFHQ in a vehicle for practical shooting practices.
DIGG M D Perera, Muni Gomes, Sumith Liyanage, Zerney Wijesuriya, SSPP Deva Corea, T H Jayah and many others were in that Police vehicle with Ravi Jayewardene (J R Jayewardene was the President at that time) who also used to travel with us in our Police vehicle for firing practices.
Before practices commence, we normally clean our weapons and prepare. In that group Zerney Wijesuriya was also cleaning his weapon and suddenly looked at me and told me that he is taking over STF as Commandant from today and he explained, what is STF role and he told me that they are looking for an officer to be in charge of (as OIC) and he thinks I will fit in there and suggested me to join the STF.
Role of the STF
I was not fully aware of the STF responsibilities, as I was away from the country for over one year in England. I was not too sure of the role of the STF.
I did not give my word for two reasons. If I joined a unit like that, I had to undergo training and I will be posted outstations and will be away from my family again. I was married less than two years and had a child just eight months. When I came to the firing lane Ravi Jayewardene was on the left flank next to me. He suddenly looked at me and said: “Nimal I heard the good news. You are joining the STF.” Then I told him I just returned from abroad, I was away from my family for a long period and I had to consult my wife, who was a very young working girl at that time. But Jayewardene again insisted that I consider his request. After the firing practices were over in the evening, I came home to my quarters at Bambalapitiya. I was an Inspector at that time and I explained to my wife the proposal. Because the son was small, her working and me being away from family for a long period, this was to be a difficult thing. She did not completely overrule the possibility of my joining STF. One hour later around 7.30 p.m, I got a call from Field Force Commandant SSP G B Dissanayake asking me to come and see him in his office immediately. I got into the uniform and went to his office.
He told me, I have to go to Katunayake Air Base to bring four bodies of the STF personnel, who got caught to a landmine in Thinnaveli, Jaffna.
It was a huge drawback. What will my family think now?
Later I had to make a huge effort to explain the situation to my wife when she vehemently disagreed with me for joining the STF. I had a good career as a Policeman in addition to being a recognized outstanding sportsman in the Police where IGP had recognised me as an officer with a future.
Since I was keen to join, she discussed the same with her parents finally I decided to join the STF. I underwent a specialized training conducted by Ex-British SAS Officers and I was posted to Kalawanchikudi Base as Base Commander in 1984. Former IGP N K Illangakoon (ASP at that time) was posted to Kalladi Camp as Commanding Officer. Initially, the STF had only two camps in the Batticaloa Ampara District.
It was a highly demanding role and a strenuous journey where various high-profile responsibilities handled during the dark days of our country. Protecting the President in the late 80s soon after the Parliament bomb blast, the STF under me was entrusted with the security of the President and I was appointed as Head of the STF unit to protect the then President, J R Jayewardene. In 1993 after the assassination of President Premadasa I was called up to protect the new Prime Minister and made me Director of Prime Minister’s security. Both assignments were completed successfully. Since the terrorists were planning to dilute the Sinhala leadership, we were determined to make sure that they would never get that opportunity.
Anti-terror operations
Leading the troops on many occasions to capture and destroy terrorist hideouts, all LTTE bases in Batticaloa were captured under my leadership. They are 48 base in Kanjikudiaru, 46 Base in Mailawattuwana and the biggest base Beirut in Kokkadicholai. Some of these operations were airborne and very risky targets. We took total control of the Eastern Province and cleared same in 2008.
Apart from the anti-terror operations, VIP protection, prepared of security assessment for VIPP, security plans of key installations in Parliament, Sapugaskanda refinery etc in the country were successfully implemented under my leadership. I thank Ravi Jayewardene and Zerni Wijesuriya for keeping faith in me and entrusting me with a huge task which will go down in the STF and country’s history.
My wife and (my children) later, were a real source of inspiration and strength to me whenever I was in tremendous pressure and stood by me at every moment and the excellent support and understanding I had from the rank and file in the STF are unbelievable. We, as the STF/Police officers, have done our part without any lapses and with the huge commitment. Today, we have a society, where people can live in harmony.
I only hope that all politicians do their part the way that we in the SF did, to eradicate terrorism and build a comfortable environment where all political actors will have to rally round with the President and give all the necessary support to build a prosperous country for our younger generation. For this, we must have correct people at the correct place and we only expect this from the politicians.
It is their duty and responsibility, as many have sacrificed a lot to achieve peace.
