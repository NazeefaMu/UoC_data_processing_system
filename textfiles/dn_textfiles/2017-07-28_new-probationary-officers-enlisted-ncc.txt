New Probationary Officers enlisted to NCC

A total of 70 Probationary Officers were enlisted to the National Cadet Corps having completed interviews and medical tests conducted at the Military Hospital.
They were selected from around 500 applicants who function as teachers at government, semi-government and private schools. These enlisted POs will be exposed to a 45-day military training at Sri Lanka Army Volunteer Force Training School, Diyathalawa under the instructions of the Commandant SL Army Volunteer Force and the Director NCC.
The training includes theoretical and practical military related matters. They will also be provided with knowledge to train school cadets when they pass out and return to schools. During the period of training food, lodging, uniforms and medical facilities would be provided by the NCC under the supervision of the State Ministry of Defence.
The NCC is one of the most prominent youth development organizations under the purview of the Ministry of Defence. Several new developments have taken place on the instructions of present Director Major General A.K.P. Wickramasinghe. It is the intention of the President and the Prime Minister to start cadet platoons in every school.
Bearing the challenge, the HQ NCC has tasked the Commanding Officers of 38 Battalions across the country including Northern and Eastern Provinces to start new Cadet Platoons to achieve the target of training 40,000 at Rantambe Training Centre for 2017. When the probationary period is over, they will be Second Lieutenant. In addition to functioning as Platoon Commanders at school, they will join the mobilized service attached to SL Army, Navy, Air Force, NCC, Ministry of Defence, Rehabilitation Department, Youth Corps and Civil Security Department according to their desire, to serve the country.
