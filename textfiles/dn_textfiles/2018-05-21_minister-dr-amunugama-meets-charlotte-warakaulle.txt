Minister Dr. Amunugama meets Charlotte Warakaulle

Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama met Charlotte Warakaulle, Director for International Relations of CERN in Geneva recently.
Minister Dr. Amunugama participated at the annual sessions of the United Nations Commission on Science and Technology for Development in Geneva. These sessions took place from recently.
CERN is the European Organization for Nuclear Research. The name CERN is derived from the acronym for the French Conseil Europeen pour la RechercheNucleaire, a provisional body founded in 1952 with the mandate of establishing a world-class fundamental physics research organization in Europe.
At that time, pure physics research concentrated on understanding the inside of the atom, hence the word ‘nuclear’.
