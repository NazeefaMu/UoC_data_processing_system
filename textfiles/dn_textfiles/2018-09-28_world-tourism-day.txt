World Tourism Day

Yesterday being World Tourism Day, there was a heavy rush of tourists to the Sigiriya Rock Fortress to view the early morning sunrise as the Central Cultural Fund had advanced admission time to the World Heritage Site to 5 am instead of the normal 7 am, to mark the occasion. Director General of the Central Cultural Fund Prof Prishantha Gunawardena who was present at the site on this occasion said steps would be taken to maintain admission time to 5 am in future to enable tourists visiting the site to have a glimpse of this eye catching splendour of early sunrise.
