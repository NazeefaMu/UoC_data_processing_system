Poson Day messages
‘Understand noble truth of Dhamma’

‘Buddhism is the greatest philosophy to enrich one's spirituality. The four sublime states of the mind; Metta, Karuna, Muditha and Upekkha, which stand for loving-kindness, compassion, appreciative joy and equanimity, teach us peace, reconciliation and spiritual calmness through the teachings of the Buddha, stated Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in a message marking Poson.
The message added: “During the 3rd Century BC, Arahant Mahinda introduced the doctrine of Buddhism on a Poson Full Moon Day. From this moment, we inherited new knowledge which enabled our society to flourish.
“The philosophy of Buddhism is accepted today and it will be accepted for many more years to come. Dhamma is not limited to this world, but absorbed in other dimensions of the world where Buddhists seek the supreme bliss of Nibbana.
“I believe that it is our utmost responsibility to understand the noble truth of Dhamma and to apply this to our daily lives.
“Let us therefore, on this significant Poson Full Moon Poya Day, return to this eternal truth so that we can shed light on our way of thinking and achieve a deeper understanding of that which is so far unknown.”
