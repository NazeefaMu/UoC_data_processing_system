All pledges will be fulfilled - Sajith

The sole intention of the President and the Prime Minister is to establish principles of good governance in this country. They will never shirk their responsibility of fulfilling the pledges made to the people in their election manifesto, Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa said.
He was addressing a meeting which followed the opening of the Weerawila Grand Channel pipe borne water supply scheme recently.
Premadasa said all past leaders who promised to do away with the Executive Presidency failed to keep their word because they didn't want to shelve the unlimited powers vested in the presidency after gaining power.
But incumbent President Maithripala Sirisena had voluntarily come forward to remove the executive powers of the Presidency and hand them over to the Parliament as promised to the people, the Maha Sangha and the civil organisations. This showed that both President and the Prime Minister evinced good governance principles by deed.
He said the government of Good Governance would never harbour or protect fraudsters and corrupt individuals involved in various rackets. But certain politicians who depended on frudulent and corrupt individuals in the past were trying in vain to protect such individuals for their personal gain. Such politicians would have short shrift under the Yahapalanaya Government.
