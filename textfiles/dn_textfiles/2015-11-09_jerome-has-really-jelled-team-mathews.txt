Jerome has really jelled with the team - Mathews

Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews has credited interim head coach Jerome Jayaratne for his team's success against the West Indies.
Sri Lanka completed a whitewash of the Tests (2-0) and the One-Day International (3-0) series that concluded at Pallekele on Saturday.
Mathews described Jayaratne as a coach who "is really jelling with the guys" and added "he is very light-hearted but very focussed".
What Jayaratne brought to the dressing room was an atmosphere of calm and collectiveness that was lacking previously.
"We worked extremely hard in changing the environment and try and get rid of the individual doubts, trying to give the players confidence and keep the dressing room environment focussed and calm - looking at all the players to enjoy the game rather than putting a lot of pressure on themselves," said Mathews. "All in all he is a very good coach and a good human being so we would like to have him around."
In the absence of a batting coach Jayaratne took on the role and did a fairly good job.
"He is specialised in that area working really hard with the batters," said Mathews.
The big change that Mathews sees from previous series is that the batters have started to take on responsibility.
"The way Kusal batted we want guys like him to grab the opportunity when they get a start. I am very pleased with Kusal he plays his normal game in the first 10 overs and then tries to settle down to bat out the 50 overs," said Mathews.
"I am very happy about the change in his approach. I trust that (Dinesh) Chandimal and (Lahiru) Thirimanne would also take on the responsibility and make the contributions they are expected of.
"The coaching staff has been brilliant in working with individuals, very pleasing to see the change of mindset."
Mathews described West Indies as "a very good team that failed to click".
"They got some super players and power hitters in their line up it's just that they didn't click in the Test matches. The conditions played a massive part in their defeat," stated Mathews.
"But more than anything overall we played better cricket than them. We were pretty clinical in our performances. We had little gaps here and there but we managed to pull it through. It's pleasing to win a trophy at home and to whitewash them."
New Zealand will be Sri Lanka's next stop and Mathews stated that it would be a challenging one.
"It's totally different conditions and different opposition. We will work on those areas as a team to improve day by day. We will give our best shot in New Zealand and train really hard in the next few weeks."
