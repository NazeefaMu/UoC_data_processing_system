JITF ‘Gateway to the North’ attracts stakeholders

The largest Consumer Exhibition and Trade Fair in the North, Jaffna International Trade Fair (JITF 2018), opened yesterday and would conclude on Sunday. The event aptly named as “Gateway to the North” is held at Jaffna Municipal Council Grounds.
The event in its ninth year was opened by the Chief Minister of the Northern Province, C. Vigneswaran and Minister of Primary Industries, Daya Gamage. The event is organized by Lanka Exhibition and Conference (Pvt) Limited, with a record 313 stalls overtaking the previous year tally of 290 stalls.
This year the event has attracted 72 Indian companies sponsored and hosted by ASSOCHAM of India (The Associated Chamber of Commerce in India) as well as from Bangladesh and other countries.
Indian Consul General for India in Jaffna, A. Natarajan said the event is growing from strength to strength and the annual Indian participation too is growing. “However I am sad to note that these Indian companies do not bring a lot of investments to North East.”
The Exhibition is widely accepted as a ‘must-attend’ in the event- calendar for all stakeholders in the supply chain and in the procurement process.
The event offers many attractions for visitors of all ages which includes an amusement park for children, all types of food and beverage, hawker type food courts and special discounts for over 1000 products.
The main sponsor of this event is S-Lon Lanka. Mobitel is the Official Telecommunication Partner, Anton is the Official Roofing Partner, Ruhunu Foods is the Official Food Partner, Insee Cement is the Official Construction Partner. Mobil is the Official Lubricant Partner, Harvest is the Official Lifestyle Partner, Dan TV is the Official Electronic Media Partner and the Print Media Partner is Uthayan Newspaper.
