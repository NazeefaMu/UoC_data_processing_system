NSB records over Rs. one trillion assets

The National Savings Bank (NSB) has recorded over Rs. one trillion of assets for the first time in its history at the beginning of this year, NSB Chairman Aswin de Silva said.
The trust placed in the bank by its customers helped achieve this historic achievement.
He said the NSB is the safest and most secure banking institution in Sri Lanka. The bank had earned the Global Finance Certification and the ‘Triple A’ grade in the International Bank Grading for the past several years.
