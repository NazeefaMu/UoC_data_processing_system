NYSC to uplift artistes in Kurunegala, Puttalam

The National Youth Service Council (NYSC) has introduced a project to help artistes in Kurunegala and Puttalama.
They will be provided with financial assistance. Loan will be granted for them to buy raw materials, tools and equipment they need.
The NYSC Cultural Unit will purchase their creations.
The NYSC will assist them to hold exhibitions and fairs. Profits will be distributed among the creators annually and a welfare fund will be setup.
Many of the artistes in the area cannot afford expenses they need for their creations and have no market.
