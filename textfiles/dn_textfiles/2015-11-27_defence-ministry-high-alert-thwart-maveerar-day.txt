Defence Ministry on high alert to thwart Maveerar Day

The Defence Ministry will be vigilant to prevent any Maveerar Day celebrations in the North, Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said .
Addressing a media conference at the Parliament premises, Minister Rajapakshe said that the LTTE is a banned organisation and hence under the Constitution, there is no legal provision to allow celebrations relating to any separatists movement within the country.
He also said that the Prevention of Terrorism Act should be replaced with new legislation consistent with international standards as the existing law of Sri Lanka does in not in harmony with international standards.
