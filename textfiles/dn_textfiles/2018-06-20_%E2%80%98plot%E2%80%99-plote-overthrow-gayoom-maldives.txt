‘Plot’ by PLOTE to overthrow Gayoom in the Maldives

Eighty well-trained PLOTE militant cadres armed with AK-47s, grenades, heavy machine guns and mortars were sailed off the Mulaithivu shores of Eastern Sri Lanka on October 30, 1988. Four stolen fishing boats were used for the voyage which headed to a destination 750 km South-west of the island in the Indian Ocean.
The island of Male, the capital of Maldives, was invaded by Sri Lanka’s terrorist leader, Uma Maheswaran exactly 30 years ago. The Maldives, Sri Lanka and India are the nations that got involved in that unique event in the history of Coup d’e 'Tats, which is generally considered a minor episode because coups and conspiracies were so common in the history of the archipelago.
The Maldives, the popular tourist destination is a glamorous sequence of coral islands numbering over 1,000—and situated 600 km from India’s West coast and 750 km South-west of Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan Tamil terrorist group led by ‘Vasanthi’ ran out of food and water in mid-sea, as a result of the unusual time taken in spotting the 26 main Atolls. They were arranged in two ‘chains’ called the Maldives. The sailors, hungry and thirsty, were overjoyed with the sight of lights around midnight of November 2, 1988, ending a four-day ordeal in violent seas of Indian Ocean. The Nothern militants landed in Male, the capital of archipelago on November 3, around 4 am; they did check their arms and ammunition on priority.
The terrorist outfit of People’s Liberation of Tamil Eelam carried out the assault in the wee hours of 3rd November 1988. A Maldivian businessman hired the outfit converting it to a mercenary army. The intention was to invade Male in a brutal attack and topple its legitimately elected government. President Abdul Gayoom was to be arrested too. However, some political analysts believe, it was Uma himself, who instigated the move for reasons that we intend to discuss here.
In the Maldives, the governments are repetitively under threat. It’s a poor tiny nation where in the early 1980s suffered two attempts to overthrow President Gayoom, but he was able to thwart them successfully. On November 3, 1988, the attack went effortlessly as the Maldives didn’t possess an army. The 1,400-strong National Security contingent [NSS] was trained in and responsible for policing, firefighting and various other security assignments. The major task assigned to PLOTE cadres was to counteract the NSS. PLOTE did it within a short time by killing a few guards and taking over the complex. They went on to capture the power supply units, harbour, TV and radio stations—all within a few hours. The main installation was brought under them. They took full control of the one and a half square km-island, Male, with a population of 35,000 people, probably the smallest capital city in the world. A walk around the island takes less than an hour. The President, Maumoon Abdul Gayoom escaped unhurt in the encounter.
By noon the same day, they held on to the entire Maldives. Next, the unexpected happened; assigned task had been satisfactorily fulfilled, the PLOTE cadres went on rampage looting shops and restaurants for food and valuables.
The conspiracy was hatched in Colombo
Abdullah Luthufi was a Maldivian businessman who ran a poultry farm in Sri Lanka. He met Uma Maheshwaran, a former Land Surveyor who is trained in Guerilla warfare under PLO in Syria and Lebanon. The conspiracy was hatched in Bambalapitiya. What motivated the businessman remains a mystery; it is not clear whether he wanted himself to become the head of Maldives or that he anticipated former President Ibrahim Nasir back as head of state.
Maheshwaran alias Mukudan was the former head of LTTE [1977 to 1980], who was chased away by Prabhakaran in 1980. He formed the new group PLOTE and being fallen on hard times was on the lookout for a base. Prabhakaran began to eliminate his competitors, since the arrival of IPKF [Indian Peace Keeping Force], forcing some smaller groups to seek refuge with IPKF. However, Uma was not in IPKF’s good books. Maheshwaran under threat from both sides was desperately looking for options. Maheshwaran wanted Luthufi to accompany his men to the islands on October 30, 1988.
The invaders made two major fatal mistakes by not taking over International Telecommunication facility and failing to capture Gayoom. It cost them heavily. The plan carried-out was only partly successful.
Gayoom appeals for intervention
President Gayoom tactfully contacted a few heads of state including USA, UK and Indian Prime Minister at dawn on November 3, and begged for help. Reagan and Thatcher ignored the requests, Gandhi summoned a conference with military and foreign affairs chiefs; a decision was made to intervene. The operation was code-named, ‘Cactus’: a parachute brigade and a commando unit of 1,600 were dispatched to Male. The troops left in massive IL-76 aircraft, while a naval craft accepted men, jeeps, helicopters, and field guns in a display of South East Asia’s regional military power. The triumph for the invaders was a short-lived one: in their afternoon news, BBC announced a rescue operation in Male by Indian para-troopers and a military contingent of hundreds of army commandos. The fighter jets whiz passed over the islands, the helpless PLOTE cadres minus their leader Vasanthi, heard the deafening noise. Paratroopers of Brigadier Farooq Balsara had begun landing on the airstrip in Hulule. The Indians commenced their counter-attack: PLOTE cadres began to panic.
The duty-free shops were looted by PLOTE at gunpoint before they got away grabbing 27 Maldivian hostages. PLOTE invaders hijacked a ship named ‘Progress Light’ and sailed away leaving behind the bodies of 19 colleagues. The beleaguered leader desperately contacted Tamil Nadu seeking refuge for his men, which was rudely turned down. Indian navy was hunting for the ship, while the Sri Lankan government announced that their Navy had been ordered to destroy it if it approached its territorial waters.
The mid sea hostage drama
On November 5, Indians had found it, they were ordered to surrender, but the PLOTE men refused, creating a hostage drama as the ‘Progress Light’ was heading for Sri Lanka. Finally, Indian Navy demonstrated their firepower; but failed to convince the militants. As the insurgents were not ready for surrender, Indians were left with just one option. Maldivian Transport Minister Ahmed Mujutuba and his wife were among the hostages; Indian Commander Gopalachari said the invaders warned him to maintain a distance of six miles to prevent the murder of hostages. By midnight on November 5, endurance on both parties began to exhaust. The terrorist reacted vengefully as Indians reached to a close one mile: two of the 27 hostages, Rehman and Sattar were dragged near the deck, and in a ghastly sight they blew-off their heads.
New Delhi ordered them to act fast. A helicopter pilot flew and remained stationary above and dropped a ‘depth charge’ on the engine room destroying it. A few panicked invaders jumped into the water; four hostages died. Commandos boarded the ship ending the drama’s second episode.
Sing Administration ignored the 2012 Coup in the Maldives. A change of policy following Gandhi assassination by the LTTE.
Uma-Luthufi conspiracy could have succeeded, not for Rajiv Gandhi. They would have created a dictatorship in the Maldives, perhaps under Sri Lankan terrorist, Uma Maheshwaran. The businessman Luthufi told an Indian journalist…,
“Uma Maheswaran came up to me in my poultry farm near Colombo and requested me to take over the country. Anybody can be the President of a nation like the Maldives. If only blessings had been with us; If only the Indian troops had not come, or at least delayed by a few more hours...”
