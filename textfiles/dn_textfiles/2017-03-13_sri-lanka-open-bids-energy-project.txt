Sri Lanka to open bids for energy project

 
Sri Lanka will open international bids for a liquefied natural gas energy project in April, a government official said.
 The project is intended to generate 300 MW of electricity for the national grid, a news agency reported. Spokesman for Sri Lanka Powers and Energy Ministry Sulakshana Jayawardane said that the government agreed to proceed with the project, to be implemented in the Colombo suburb called ‘Kerawalapitiya’. “We are now working on the tender process,” he said.
 Sri Lanka mainly depends on hydro, coal and thermal power for its energy requirement. The country operates one coal power plant established with financial cooperation from China.
