Ron Kaufman in Sri Lanka – an unprecedented success

SLIM, the national body for marketing in Sri Lanka, notched yet another highly successful delivery of its mandate of creating opportunities to receive global knowledge and competencies to the Sri Lankan business fraternity, with the international workshop with the world’s No 1 Service Guru, Ron Kaufmann.
The secrets to successful customer service and service excellence were shared by the eminent educator with over 1000 Sri Lankans. Kaufman is renowned for motivating his audience to make palpable changes in their service leadership culture and proved his skills with the large audience who were highly impressed by his knowledge and expertise.
Over the course of two days, he imparted the best global practices which were highly relevant to the increasingly globalised economy that marketers function in. At both, the CEO Forum, which had a participation of over 300 decision makers and the Knowledge Forum with over 1,000 marketers and professionals of similar capacities, Kaufman captivated his audience with key learnings, practical examples and his renowned blueprint for gaining a competitive edge in any industry and business.
Looking back at both the CEO Breakfast Forum themed ‘Leading the Service Focused Culture’ and the Knowledge Forum titled ‘Service Leadership – The Inevitable’, which were deemed unprecedentedly successful, judging by the highly positive feedback received, SLIM President Karthik Elangovan said, “Undoubtedly, this is a milestone for Sri Lankan marketers and our corporates because we have opened up an absolute treasure trove in inculcating a service driven culture into the macro landscape of the Sri Lankan economy. This is really important for Sri Lanka’s development agenda and I do believe that a service driven culture forms a strong foundation for the nation’s vision going forward.” Stating that SLIM, as the national body for marketing, has delivered the fundamentals and the blueprint required to build this service driven culture, Elangovan said that ‘Ron Kaufman Live in Sri Lanka’ has now given the country the key to uplift organisational culture into one of service leadership.
Project Chairperson Ranga Perera believes that the practical examples coupled with theory and work knowledge imparted by Kaufman has set the pace for corporates to now look upwards and outwards. “For SLIM, this event was truly a trailblazer and one that made us proud, especially as we have contributed to the country’s forward journey.”
Underlining that it was collective teamwork, leadership demonstrated by the SLIM Council, a penetrative marketing campaign and holistic planning which heralded this unprecedented crowd-puller of over 1,300 participants, Perera adds that SLIM has truly made a great achievement by having Ron Kaufman’s universally applicable expertise shared across multiple industries and companies in Sri Lanka.
Determined to continue the momentum of the success stemming from this event, CEO/Executive Director Sanath Senanayaka proclaims that SLIM is committed to impart global knowledge and experience and therefore would feature such personalities for the benefit of the business fraternity.
