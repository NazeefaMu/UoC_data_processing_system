Mahindananda's case transferred to another High Court

The Court of Appeal yesterday issued an order transferring a case filed against former Sports Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage to another court of competent jurisdiction other than the Colombo High Court presided over by High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga.
Court of Appeal Justice Kumuduni Wickremesinghe and Justice S. Thurairajah made this order pursuant to a transfer application filed by former Sports Minister Aluthgamage.
The Court of Appeal further ordered to expeditiously conclude the High Court trial against Mahindananda Aluthgamage. The court observed that there is a fair reason to believe that this matter should be transferred from High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga to another court.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against Aluthgamage for allegedly purchasing a house worth Rs. 27 million at Kynsey Road, Colombo 7 over a complaint that he had allegedly purchased properties through illegally acquired money.In his petition, Aluthgamage stated that High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga was a member of the Presidential Commission (PRECIFAC) which initiated an inquiry against members of the former regime and further said he would deny a fair trial. President’s Counsel Faizer Mustapha with Counsel Keerthi Tillekaratne instructed by Sanath Wijewardena appeared for Mahindananda Aluthgamage. Senior State Counsel Janaka Bandara appeared for the Attorney General.
