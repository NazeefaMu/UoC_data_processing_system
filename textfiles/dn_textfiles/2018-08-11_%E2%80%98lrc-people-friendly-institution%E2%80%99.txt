‘LRC, a people-friendly institution’

The Land Reform Commission (LRC), which had bribery and corruption allegations for a long period, is now converted to a people-friendly institution, Land Reforms Commission Chairman Dr. Sampath Subasinghe Arachchi told the Daily News.
The Land Reform Law of 1972 deprived agriculture land to owners of above 50 acres of highland and 25 acres of paddy cultivation.
Under the Land Reform Law, a legendary national leader, the late Land Minister Hector Kobbekaduwa, was instrumental in establishing the Land Reform Commission, acquiring land above the ceiling and redistributing agricultural land to landless farmer families to transform the agriculture sector for national prosperity.
The role of the Land Reform Commission, for over 45 years, was under the provisions of the Land Reform Act amended from time to time by policy decisions taken by governments from time to time.
Under the leadership of Lands and Parliamentary Reforms Minister Gayantha Karunathilake, the present management would be able to acquire large extents of land distributed illegally and decision were taken to provide these lands to the Industries and Commerce Ministry for the establishment of industrial zones.
“The minister has directed us to take disciplinary action against those found guilty of corruption and six officers, found to be involved in bribery and corruption, were interdicted,” he said.
The release of statutory obligations of land owners and payment of compensation to them, the utilization of lands which have been vested in productive investments and the collection of revenue of the Commission, protection of lands, training of staff and welfare are the priorities of the Commission, he said.
“The LRC is a self-funded body and providing land for investors. Taxes collected from investment projects and the mineral taxes are the main sources of income of the LRC. We have been able to stop unauthorized stone quarrying and sand mining practiced in the country,” he added.
“After Minister Karunathilaka became the Lands Minister in June 2017, several steps were taken to enhance the efficiency of the LRC services and make the institution a profitable venture.”
“The number of deeds distributed during six months was higher than the deeds issued during the past five years.”
“The Commission is also conducting a programme to release lands for families who do not have a single inch of land,” he said.
He added that the Land Reform Commission is entrusted with the National Programme for the allocation of one million land deeds.
An accelerated programme of distributing one million permanent deeds for families settled in the lands of the Land Reform Commission is implemented under the guidance of Minister Karunathilake, fulfilling an election pledge of the President and the Prime Minister.
The Chairman said it was useless keeping high fertile agricultural lands under the LRC without making use of them and he proposed to distribute plots of land among unemployed youths willing to be agricultural entrepreneurs.
