Sumanthiran’s comments on Vigneswaran causes controversy

TNA MP M.A. Sumanthiran’s recent comments on the re-appointment of Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Vigneswaran has resulted in controversy being stirred within the TNA. In a media briefing held in Jaffna, Sumanthiran said the TNA did not expect to re-nominate Vigneswaran as its Chief Ministerial candidate at the next Provincial Council elections. Senior members of PLOTE and TELO, also representing the TNA, have stated that Sumanthiran was merely voicing his personal opinion based on his sour relationship with the Chief Minister and that this was not the opinion of the TNA. Senior TELO member, MP M.K. Sivajilingam has said that if Vigneswaran wished to contest for the post again, TELO would support his nomination.
