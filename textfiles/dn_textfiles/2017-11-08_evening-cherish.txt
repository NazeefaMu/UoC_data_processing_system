An evening to cherish

With the silvery rays of the moon, the blissful night shone with the Sound of Music in Moratuwa with a difference, all talents of Moratuwa glittered on one stage at the Holy Emmanuel Parish Hall recently.
The Chief Guests were Nihal Perera, Dilani while Finance State Minister Eran Wickremaratne, Former Moratuwa Mayor Samanlal Fernando, the priests from the Anglican Church, Venerable Panapitiya Premananda Thera and many other distinguished guests lit the Traditional Oil lamp to commence the grand event. The Project Chairman was Lucky Deva assisted by the enthusiastic members of the Arts Forum that conducted the show with a success. The background music enveloped was The Spirit.
The significance of the event was that all talents performed in singing, dancing and other types of entertainment were only by the well recognized national figures of the Moratuwa Musical city. The vibrant melodious vocalists of 70s, the stimulating steps of the dancers of Chandana Wickremasinghe Academy and other few dancing academies, the hilarious performances of Terrance and Don Guy, the singing of Sunil Perera (Gypsies), Derana Dream Star Sapumal, Prof Manela Joseph and many singers thronged the air with amusement and life, which kept the feet tap tapping and clapping with smiling cheers of the box office audience glued to their seats for more than three hours expecting more events to come!
