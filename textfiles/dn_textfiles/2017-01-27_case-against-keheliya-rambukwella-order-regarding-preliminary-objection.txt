Case against Keheliya Rambukwella: Order regarding preliminary objection fixed for Feb. 23

Colombo Additional Magistrate Aruni Artigala yesterday set date for order regarding the preliminary objection raised by former Minister Keheliya Rambukwella and two others over a corruption case filed by the Bribery Commission.
The corruption case filed against Rambukwella and two others for allegedly causing an unlawful loss to the government after purchasing 600 of GI pipes using Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation’s (SLRC) funds during the previous Presidential Election was yesterday fixed for February 23. The Additional Magistrate is to announce her order on that date.
The Bribery Commission yesterday filed counter objections against the preliminary objections raised by the defence challenging the maintainability of the charge sheets.
The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed charges against Rambukwella, former SLRC Director General Chandrapala Liyanage, and former SLRC Chairman Wimal Rubasinghe under section 70 of the Bribery Act.
The Commission alleged that three accused had incurred a loss of Rs. 990,000 to the SLRC after unnecessarily purchasing 600 of GI pipes on or around December 2, 2014.
Senior State Counsel Asad Navavi appeared for the Attorney General. President’s Counsel Kalinga Indatissa with Counsel Indika Giragamage appeared for the former minister.
