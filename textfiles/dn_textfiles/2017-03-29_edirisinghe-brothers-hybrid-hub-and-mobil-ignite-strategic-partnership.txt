 In a calculated bid to enhance automotive maintenance services of hybrid vehicles in Sri Lanka, Hybrid Hub, the only facility in Sri Lanka which specializes in hybrid vehicles and McLarens Lubricants Limited, authorized distributors of Mobil Oil in Sri Lanka have entered a strategic partnership.
The new venture heralds good news to the country’s hybrid vehicle owners as it brings together the expertise of two industry leaders in the automotive maintenance industry to offer unmatched products and services.
The strategic partnership is set to usher in a level of service and product offering that is unmatched elsewhere in the country’s automotive maintenance industry and in particular the hybrid vehicle market.
To ignite the unique benefits of this partnership, Hybrid Hub and McLarens Lubricants Limited will conduct a series of hybrid car clinics from 25th March 2017 to give opportunities to customers island-wide to avail themselves of the combined wealth of knowledge and expertise.
