Kandyan dancing and cheerleading
 
The Sri Lankan cricket encounter with India in the Micromax cup has left the hard-core cricket fans of Sri Lanka devastated. But in the fringes of the stadium is something that devastates the true lovers of Kandyan dancing as well. The Kandyan dancers in the fringe of the stadium, dancing whenever a boundary or a six is scored or a wicket falls is hard to miss. But whether Kandyan dancing should be used for “cheerleading” is a question.
True that cheerleading promotes one’s team and help boost the team spirit and is frequently seen at sports events around the world. The cheerleaders use varying forms of dancing and acrobatics in their performance. Kandyan dancing on the other hand is more than just a dance. It is an art which is most honoured and respected by the Sri Lankans and is a major part of cultural identity, with an origin associated with religious festivals. It is very structured and the learning is done with utmost respect for the art and high discipline is maintained.
The Kandyan dancer “graduate” in the art through ves mangalya or kalaveny mangalya (according to their gender), only after which they can wear the headgear. And they are also governed by written and unwritten rules and customs closely associated with culture and religion. For such artists to be seen in sport events as mere dancers, in my opinion, is degrading to the art itself.
A dance still performed at highest religious festivals to be also performed at every cricket stadium takes away its dignity and value. It shouldn’t be misunderstood that I am hereby condemning the practise of cheerleading. It can, by all accounts, be practised here in Sri Lanka, only that, they should either use the western dancing styles which are commonly used by cheerleaders, or if they want to be “original”, they can perhaps create dances incorporating Sri Lankan dancing traditions, but it should be done in such a way that they preserve the dignity and value of traditional dancing. I genuinely hope that authorities take steps against this new “addition” to Sri Lankan cricket experience.
