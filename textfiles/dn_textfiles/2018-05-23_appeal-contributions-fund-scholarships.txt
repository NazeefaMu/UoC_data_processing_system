Appeal for contributions to fund scholarships

The Syed Abdurahiman Jiffri Mowlana Memorial Trust has made an appeal for financial contributions towards its fund to grant more scholarships to deserving students during the holy month of Ramadan, the joint secretary of the trust said in a press release.
The Trust was founded in 1978 to perpetuate the memory of Marhoom Syed Abdurahiman Jiffri Mowlana who passed away in the holy city of Mecca in 1978.
The Trust has completed 40 years of service in the field of education by offering scholarships to deserving students who pursue education in medicine and engineering at state universities. Hundreds of students have passed out as doctors and engineers and are well settled; some are pursuing postgraduate studies in foreign universities too.
Although hundreds of applications seeking financial assistance are received, only a certain percentage is considered in this holy month of Ramadan. The Trust appeals for financial contributions to grant more scholarships to deserving students.
The trust is headed by Al-Haj M.A. Navaz Caffoor and the secretaries are M. Nowfal Barry and M. Fyzal Mohamed.
