Lion Brewery posts Rs 5.43 bn turnover in 1Q

Lion Brewery has recorded a turnover of Rs. 5.43 billion and a pre-tax profit of Rs.315.79 million for the first quarter ended June 30, 2017.
The pre-tax profit includes Rs.608.70 million received as a part payment against the business interruption insurance claim made, on account of the flood of May 2016.
In the corresponding quarter of the previous year, the Company recorded a pre-tax loss of Rs.316.65 million on a turnover of Rs 5.61 billion. The Company’s performance in the quarter is a reflection of industry woes stemming from the multiple tax increases imposed on soft alcohol since October 2015.
During a 14-month period since then, excise duty on beer was increased by 70% and a can tax was introduced only for the beer category. 
During this same period, the tax on spirits was increased by a much more palatable 25%.
VAT too was re-introduced although this covered all alcobevs. As a result of these multiple taxes, the price of beer increased by as much as 75% over a 14-month period. Thus, beer is now unaffordable. This has compelled consumers to shift to cheaper, value for money alternatives such hard alcohol, toddy and illicit alcohol. All three alternatives are more harmful to consumers than the milder beer.
Further, government derives no taxes from illicit alcohol and only a small percentage of what is due from toddy. Due to the effects of pricing, beer industry volumes have declined.
Company’s sales volumes too have declined in line with those of the industry. Since the decline in volumes closely follows substantial investments on account of a major expansion and an acquisition, the challenges posed are significant. Management is currently working on re-structuring initiatives including cost reductions across the value chain. Company faces a challenging financial year. However, company’s business is built on solid foundations - strong brands and distribution systems, world class beers, state of the art technology and a committed team – and therefore capable of overcoming the turbulence it faces at present.
