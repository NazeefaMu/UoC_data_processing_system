Glory of Ramadan

The Islamic calendar has 12 months and the Ramadan falls on the ninth month. Ramadan means completely destroying one's sin, and it plays a vital role in the spiritual life of every Muslim across the world.
Basically there are five pillars in Islam. The fist pillar is Kalima, second Prayer, third Zakath, fourth Ramadan and fifth is Haj. Every Muslim should try to uphold these five pillars because it is the fundamental of Islam. Though Ramadan takes the fourth place, it has a deeper meaning in the practical term.
Ramadan is a blessed month of mercy, blessings, forgiveness, patience and peace. Muslims all over the world fast 30 days in this month and they are divided into three divisions. The first 10 days of fasting is for blessings (Rahmath), second 10 days is for seeking repentance for the sins they committed (Magfirath) and the last 10 days for seeking protection from the Hell (Ethukum Minannar).
Every Muslim should observe fasting during the 30 days, yet there are certain exceptions for elderly people, pregnant and breast-feeding mothers and patients who cannot fast due to their illnesses and also for travellers.
The Muslims who skip fasting should fast on a later days or provide compensations for the days they could not fast.
Fasting means not merely refraining from food and drinks. Think of a machine that functions throughout the year without a break. It will soon break down or get into troubles. Our body is also functioning all 365 days without a rest; as a result the body will be exhausted and apparently prone to fall sick. Fasting provides rest for our body; besides its bodily benefits, it also brings numerous spiritual benefits. People generally tend to commits sins during the eleven months but during the Ramadan they determine to refrain from committing sins.
There are several significant good deeds that every Muslim should observe during the month such as reciting the Holy Quran, Perform tharawi and involving in charity (sadaqua) and so on. But in real context, Muslim brothers and sisters engage in speaking ill of others, watching televisions, playing carom and chess and idling away precious time during the Ramadan. They should completely make themselves free from these activities, as they are not going to bring any rewards by doing them. These entertainments will erode their good deeds and they finally end up as bankrupt on the doomsday.The fasting takes the forth place in the five pillars of Islam and prayers (salah) take the second place. Some Muslim brothers and sisters tend to skip five times prayers and observe only fasting. They do not obtain any spiritual improvements and rewards in skipping away prayers and fasting.
One should perform prayers and fasting simultaneously so as to obtain the real benefits from Ramadan. This month is also gifted with divinely benefits such as the doors of the heavens are open and the doors of the hells are closed, the Satan is handcuffed and the rewards for good deeds are multiplied during the Ramadan.
If a Muslim performs five times prayers during the Ramadan, it is 70 folds greater than the prayers which he performs in other ordinary days. The holy month is also gifted with a meritorious night referred to as Lailathu-Qadir, which is greater than thousand months.
Allah has honoured the month by revealing the Holy Quran in the same month. The Muslims should realise the real purpose of Ramadan and perform all rituals accordingly. It would pave the way for them to remain the heaven forever.
