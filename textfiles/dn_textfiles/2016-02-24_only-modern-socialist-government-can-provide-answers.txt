'Only a modern socialist government can provide answers'

The third National Summit of the Socialist Youth Union (SYU) will be held on February 28, 2016 at Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium. Chairman of the World Federation of Democratic Youth will be Chief Guest. The participation of local and foreign youth is expected.
Addressing the media, SYU Chairman and Parliamentarian Bimal Rathnayake said that the national summit will be held under the theme "Socialism for Life and the Future," with the participation of JVP leaders, artistes and youth activists.
He said that a new National Youth Charter will also be launched at the summit. "The country's youth have no life and future within the prevailing political, social and cultural environment of the country", he said. He also said the past 68 years had failed to provide a political solution to the issues faced by the country's youth. "Neither the Rajapaksa Family nor the present joint government have provided us with a positive solution to these issues. We urge country's youth to extend their support to a modern socialist political movement, as only a modern socialists government can provide answers", he said.
