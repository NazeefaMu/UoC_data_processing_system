Combank sponsors gold medal for best in accounting degree at Colombo University

The Commercial Bank of Ceylon has come forward to recognise academic excellence in university education by awarding a Gold medal annually for the best performance at the Bachelor of Business Administration in Accounting Degree Programme of the University of Colombo.
The first ‘Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC Gold Medal for the Best Performance in Bachelor of Business Administration in Accounting Degree’ is to be presented at this year’s convocation to a student of the 2014 batch who obtains a First Class and gains the highest Grade Point Average (GPA).
The Gold medal will thereafter be awarded annually, and will be jointly awarded if more than one student is eligible, the Bank said.
