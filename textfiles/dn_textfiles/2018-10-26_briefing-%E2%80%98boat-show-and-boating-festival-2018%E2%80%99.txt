Briefing on ‘Boat Show and Boating Festival - 2018’

A briefing on the ‘Boat Show and Boating Festival - 2018’ was recently held at the Sri Lankan Consulate in Mumbai. The event will be held between today and Sunday at the Yacht Marina in Galle.
Importers of boats, as well as representatives of shipping associations and trade chambers in Mumbai attended the event.
India is a key export market for Sri Lanka’s boat-building industry, which accounted for US$11.71 million last year. Under the Indo-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement, boats and ships can be imported to India sans basic customs duty.
While inviting the business community to explore investment opportunities in Sri Lanka, the Consul General said Sri Lanka had a robust boat and ship-building industry, and that the upcoming marine festival would showcase the country’s capabilities in recreational boating, yachting, marine tourism, boat-building and related services for the local and international markets. The Consulate Consul (Commercial) made a presentation on the boat and ship-building Industry in Sri Lanka.
The boat-building sector has been identified as a priority sector under the National Export Strategy of Sri Lanka, with a view to promote investment for infrastructure development in the boating industry.
The event was followed by a joint awareness programme launched by the Consulates of Sri Lanka and Norway, focusing on Norwegian maritime companies based in Maharashtra, India.
