Minister calls to ensure quality of seafood exports

Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera has instructed relevant authorities to take measures to export the best quality seafood products to maintain the prevailing demand for Sri Lankan seafood products in the international market.
Addressing a progress review meeting held on Thursday at the Ministry premises, Minister Amaraweera said Sri Lanka has to compete with many countries to get a better market for local seafood exports. Therefore, seafood exporters should consider the quality of export products to get more market opportunities.
According to the Minister, Sri Lanka’s seafood exports have recorded a 44 percent growth in 2017. This year, the country has earned Rs. 28,685 million by exporting about 18,262 metric tons of fisheries products. The income generated through ornamental fish exports was Rs. 1,678 million.
“The country was able to export 5,197 metric tons and earn Rs. 7,853 million after the European Union lifted the ban on fish exports,” he said.
The Minister also instructed officials to encourage fishermen to engage in the industry without breaching international laws and regulations.
