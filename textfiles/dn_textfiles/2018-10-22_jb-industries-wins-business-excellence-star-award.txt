Industries which has had an illustrious journey in business for the last 20 years, to become one of the leading manufacturers of concrete mixer machines, celebrated their 20th anniversary this year, thus making this award even more significant for the company.

The equipment are manufactured at their factory in Ulapane and distributed island wide as well as exported to the Maldives and other countries abroad. J.B. Alahakoon also hopes to in future widen the export market to other countries in South Asia as well. “I have to especially mention that all our products are made to help our customers make a profit themselves. At the same time as these products are locally manufactured and exported, it helps bring in a lot of foreign exchange into the country.
All our products are high in quality, meet all standards and are long lasting. Our products have never had any maintenance issues during the warranty period and this is proof of their high quality and standard,” said J.B. Alahakoon. The JB Industries head office is located Kiribathkumbura, Kandy and their showroom Polgahamula, Peradeniya.
