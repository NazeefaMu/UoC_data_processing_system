CITIZENS' Mail - (19-10-2017)

 Make children comfortable with wordplay
How well children learn the word is influenced by many things, including the environment and the manner in which adults speak to them. Communication experts Dr Rebecco Frost, Dr Katherine Twomey, Dr Gemme Taylor, Professor Gert Westermann and Professor Padraic Monaghan explain that a language-rich environment helps children through the early stages of language development from identifying words in the speech to using them in sentences. But here, we look more closely at how children learn words, particular names for objects, and how they use their environment to guide this process.
Helping children to learn words at an early age is incredibly important because the number of words that a toddler knows predicts how well they will learn to read when they get to school. However, word-learning is enormously complicated, and there are two primary reasons for this.
First, children need to understand that some of the sounds that grownups make actually relate to things around them. For example, when we hear a lion roar, we tend not to assume that the lion is telling us anything –what it had for dinner, for example. But children have to figure out that human speech is completely different from other sounds they hear, because it carries meaning.
The word learning is hard is because children have to link new words to their meaning. And there are many ways someone says: ‘Look, a rabbit’ as a rabbit runs past, children cannot know for certain how this phrase relates to what they see. It could be to the rabbit itself, but it could also be the rabbit’s fur, the running motion, the beauty of the scene, or other aspects of the environment.
Fortunately, though, young children are extremely sophisticated word learners. By age two, children have started to learn the meaning of a word after hearing it only a few times. Children can even learn meanings without being explicitly told them, if they already know the names of other objects that are around at the same time.
