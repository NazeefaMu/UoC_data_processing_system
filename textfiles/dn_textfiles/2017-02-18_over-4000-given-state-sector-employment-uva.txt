Over 4,000 given state sector employment in Uva

A total of 4,212 diplomates and graduates were given employment in the state sector within the Uva province during the last two years. This included a batch of 1,559 in 2015 and a batch of 2,653 in 2016, said Uva province Governor, M. P. Jayasinghe.
He was addressing a press conference held to mark the completion of two years in office as Governor. He said whenever he came accross any problem or issue in the province highlighted in the media, he had taken instant action by directing relevent officials to attend to them without delay. The objective of appointing graduate teachers was to uplift education in rural schools in the province.
He had always received the unstinted support of the Chief Mnister and staff in carrying out his duties. He also said steps would be taken to implement a welfare programme for members of the Uva Media Forum including the issuing of free travel passes to them in public transport.
