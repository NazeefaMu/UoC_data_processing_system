Point of view
Negative retail sentiment dominated markets for most of the week, pushing the benchmark ASPI to a 35-week low.
Margin calls and persistent selling pressure resulted in a 91.85 point decline W-o-W and Index losses were led mainly by Banking counters.
Average turnover value however, increased over the week supported mainly by HNI and Institutional investor transactions which contributed 50% to total market turnover.
Retail investors remained largely passive as the year-end holiday sentiment weighed in on activity levels.
Net foreign inflows meanwhile, resurfaced following last week's LKR 211.4mn net outflow as buying interest in JKH and Asiri Hospital Holdings boosted total foreign purchases to LKR 3.4bn (cf. LKR 1.13bn last week).
Net inflows for the week consequently amounted to LKR 317.0mn. Similar sluggish sentiment is likely to prevail next week ahead of the upcoming holidays but next week's US Fed meeting is also likely to provide some direction to the market.
November inflation increases to 3.1% Y-o-Y
November inflation data released on Monday indicated a 140 bps increase in consumer prices, bringing the Consumer Price Index to 184.7 points in November cf. 182.1 points in October.
The increase consequently represented a 3.1% Y-o-Y rate of inflation relative to 1.7% Y-o-Y in the previous month.
Prices increases were led mainly by a 5.2% Y-o-Y increase in prices in the Food category, translating to an inflation contribution of 2.5% by food commodities.
Annual average inflation consequently rose to 0.9% in November from 0.7% in October 2015. Average annual inflation levels throughout the year however have been on a downward trend, declining for 8 consecutive months until October when annual average price levels remained at 0.7%.
This month's 0.2% increase is the first increase in annual average inflation since February 2013.
