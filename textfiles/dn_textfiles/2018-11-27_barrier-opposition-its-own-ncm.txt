BARRIER FROM OPPOSITION TO ITS OWN NCM

A Writ petition submitted by 122 Members of the Opposition against Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and the Cabinet of Ministers yesterday, prayed the Court of Appeal to issue an order in the nature of Quo Warranto declaring that Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa has no right to hold the Office of Premiership, has prevented Parliament arguing the No Confidence Motion.
Giving his studied opinion on this issue Prof. Prathibha Mahanama said that when matters are referred to courts for consideration such maters could not be discussed in Parliament.
“If one does, it could be interpreted as intervening to courts,” the Professor. said.
The Court of Appeal yesterday(26) considered the petition submitted by the UNP, TNA, JVP, SLMC and numbering signatures of altogether 122 Members of Parliament. The petition was considered by Justice Preethi Padman Surasena (President) and Justice Arjuna Obeysekera and it to be taken up for further consideration on November 30 and December 3 respectively.
The Court also ordered lawyers appearing for the petitioners to provide copies relevant to the case filed, to the defendants prior to the next hearing date. The petition submitted to courts has stated that Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa does not command a majority in Parliament and hence in relation to amended Article 13 of the Constitution, Rajapaksa does not have the right to hold the post of Premiership.
Thus, the petitioners have prayed to courts to declare that Mahinda Rajapaksa has no right to hold office of Premiership legally and to issue orders nullifying his appointment to the post invalid. Petitioners have sited 49 persons including Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa.
The very same group that petitioned Courts against Mahinda Rajapaksa holding Office as Premier is scheduled to take up the No Confidence Motion (NCM) tabled against the Prime Minister when Parliament meets on November 29 and we posed this question to Prof. Prathibha Mahanama, to get his view as to how the two institutions operate in this scenario.Prof. Mahanama’s studied view was that Parliament would not table the ‘No Confidence Motion’.
“Parliamnt has to wait until the court gives its verdict,” the Professor said.Clarifying why he said so, the Professor reasoned out that when an issue is before Court for consideration, no discussions were held in Parliament. In the present context, the Courts will not entertain an issue to be taken up in Parliament for discussion, he opined.
“In accordance with the Sri Lanka Constitution, it prevents Courts from examining, inquiring and ordering, issues that are related to Parliament. At the same time the petitioners have not properly worded the No Confidence Motion, tabled in Parliament.
The decision in respect of the said No Confidence Motion is purely an act of Parliament and Not of the Judiciary. Although former Chief Justice Sarath N.Silva ordered Parliament to reduce the price of petrol, it was very clearly manifested that Parliament took no note of it,” Prof. Mahanama said.
“Also, the Sri Lanka Parliament ignored a request of the Supreme Court in respect of a former Lady Chief Justice. In the same breath, one must know that Parliament has no powers to give orders to the Courts,” Prof. Mahanama explained, as such actions tally with the fundamentals of the Constitutional law.
