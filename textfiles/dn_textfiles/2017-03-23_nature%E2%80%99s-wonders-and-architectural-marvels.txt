Nature’s wonders and architectural marvels

Nature is magnificent and living in a tropical country gives us a spectacular view of the wonders of nature. Arch World speaks to Archt. Jeeva Wijesundara about how amazing nature can be.
“Tropical countries such as ours are naturally colorful throughout the year. Blue skies turning red in evenings and silver gray in rains, green trees with golden orange matured leaves here and there, paddies swinging with winds and gardens with fruits and flowers, sandy beaches and grounds, brown marshes various creatures such as birds, butterflies, squirrels, insects, reptiles and so on, provide a colorful set up. The use of colors of the nature, which we call earthen colors makes people feel cheerful, comfortable and relaxing, depending on the activity type,” explained Wijesundara.
With the provision of optimum natural light and ventilation, automatically, the internal spaces become connected with the natural surroundings. Sounds of water, birds, squirrels, wind, even the fragrance of nature brings a relief to the human mind and body.
“Being in the rain under an umbrella and looking at the rain from the window gives two different feelings. Similarly, being in nature and enjoying nature are different. For a person, a house becomes his or her ‘own home’ with a set of such feelings related to belongingness - physical and mental comfort, relaxation, freedom, delightfulness, spaciousness. Nature and its changes; rising and setting sun, wind, rain, vista, sound, make a series of changes inside the home gradually and smoothly,” pointed out Wijesundara
Tropical climate
A tropical climate is a blessing for the built environment to be in line with the natural environment to a great extent. In countries with cold winters and hot summers, people tend to live against nature.
“For example, during cold times, heaters, and during hot times, air conditioners are to be used, throughout the year which consume quite a big amount of energy. Tropical climate like ours is one of the best provisions for energy efficiency. Use the optimum amount of sunlight and natural ventilation is one of the best ways to create energy efficient, healthy environments. Solar power, energy efficient and recycling systems, fittings and equipment are modern interventions in application today,” said Wijesundara.
Nature is wonderful but so is the genius of man when it comes to architecture.
“Apart from the great pyramids, we should look at the examples from our country. People compared great reservoirs such as Parakrama Samudra to the ocean. Sigiriya is considered as the 8th wonder of the world. Sri Lankans built the first ever tallest brick dagabas. All these were done by transferring a ‘dream’ originated in human mind, into then available technology, with the materials, architectural experience and human power.
Today, the technology is far more developed; modern, and still sustainable. Durable building materials, and time and cost effective construction systems have evolved. The concept of ‘timelessness’ is not the technology or the use of materials. It is how the buildings or the built environment are dreamed to address the desires and aspirations of the prevailing society, the culture and the economy. Such sensitive creations are ever-living,” elucidated Wijesundara
Deeper human needs such as the sense of rest, relaxation, belongingness, identity and security are not only related to the building in which we live or work.
Outdoor environments
“Outdoor environments are also responsible in making pleasant feelings in human mind. Public spaces such as parks, jogging tracks, roads, pedestrian pavements, bus-stops, railway stations, service stations, shopping malls or the super markets should give a ‘sense of place,’for the users to make them feel that ‘the space is theirs’. Then only do they feel the need to protect it, to love it, to keep it clean. This culture is bit rare in our context. This is inter-related with the education levels of the society as well,” emphasized Wijesundara
Nothing is permanent. It’s true that birth is hand-in hand with death. But we are neither awaiting death nor rejecting death. We all try to spend a good life with our family and others, in a good environment, until we leave the life.
“Similarly, Buildings, or the built environment gradually decays with the time. Identifying the heritage, preservation, restoration and conservation aspects would lengthen the life time of the remarkable architecture. In that sense, adaptable re-use of old buildings and environs is a good approach in the stream of urban conservation, for future use, for new generations. This has become successful in most European countries and few good examples are available in our context as well,” added Wijesundara.
Architects know all about emotions. Mastering the art of evoking emotions through the use of spaces is their specialty.
‘Places’ make people emotional. For example, in a church, kovil or a temple, nobody instructs you to be quiet, but you would be. Even a kid would start whispering there, rather than shouting. Why? A quality of a place is sensed and responded by relevant reactions. But how that quality has been achieved through architecture is hard to explain in perfect wordings. It would be a combination of elements; the use of forms, heights, proportions, colors, textures, solid and void effects, light/light effects, shadows, articulation of spaces and so on. It differs from one place to the other. It could be either pleasant and inviting, or harsh and fearful. That is the wisdom; the creativity,” informed Wijesundara.
Timeless beauty
The ‘Timeless beauty’ of a place, which makes the user satisfied throughout the life time is the ‘spirit’ of architecture, even after making sensitive modifications or alterations as per the changing needs and requirements.
For example, a house for a family with small kids will be modified once the kids are grown up. It would be different once the kids are married and the parents are old. But what is important is the ‘essence’ of its beauty. Applicability of this phenomenon is not only about residential architecture, but also for other environs as well, with the changes of socio-cultural needs,” stated Wijesundara.
Sri Lankan architecture is already fused with modern architectural trends, materials and technology by now.
“It is obvious that with the increasing needs and the development trends, modern technology should be applicable for a well-balanced fusion without destroying our identity. To achieve this task, architects should be sufficiently knowledgeable and exposed to choose what is really necessary and suitable. Sometimes, discussions with other architects for different views are fruitful.
Environmental and climatic crisis are inter-related, which has become crucial in our context today. This has to be a national concern. Urban and financial crisis of the country would definitely have an effect on the development of the country, which makes related repercussions to the profession of architecture, as well as the whole construction trade.
“For a country or a community to become truly great, it’s a blessing to have devoted community leaders, and engaged citizens. Use of relevant professional input into the country’s development process makes the educated citizens engaged in the service.”
“Spaces and places are always related to human thinking and behavior. Spiritual spaces are also places for people. Though not everybody, some are mentally benefitted by their spirituality. Apart from the religiosity, every human being senses and enjoys the serenity of spiritual places and benefitted by the mental relaxation,” summed up Wijesundara.
