Alleged attack by UC Chairman :
Maharagama UC workers launch strike

Maharagama Urban Council workers yesterday (7) launched a strike against the alleged attack on two fellow workers by Maharagama Urban Council Chairman Tiraj Lakruwan.
Two workers of the Maharagama Urban Council were admitted to the Homagama Hospital after being allegedly attacked by the Chairman. According to hospital sources, the condition of one victim A.K. Ariyawansha (58) is critical.
Opposition member of the Maharagama Urban Council Ruwan Jayasinghe said the Chairman had allegedly assaulted these two workers after taking them to a room, accusing them of being drunk at the time. Condemning the alleged attack on public servants, the UC member said that the Chairman has no right to attack UC workers and he should have taken disciplinary action against them, if they were found to have consumed alcohol while on duty.
