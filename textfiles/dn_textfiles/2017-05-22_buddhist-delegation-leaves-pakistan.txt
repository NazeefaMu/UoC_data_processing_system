Buddhist delegation leaves for Pakistan

A 34-member delegation led by Most Venerable Kanumuldeniye Chandavimala Mahanayaka Thera, comprising senior monks, religious scholars, government officials and pilgrims left for Pakistan recently on the invitation of the Government of Pakistan to attend the Vesak festival at Taxila for the second consecutive time from May 21 to 24.
Pakistan Acting High Commissioner Dr. Sarfraz Ahmed Khan Sipra and other officials of the High Commission of Pakistan were there to see-off the delegation at the Bandaranaike International Airport.
Despite being a predominantly Muslim country, Pakistan is celebrating Vesak and many countries haver been invited for the Festival.
The delegation will visit different sites of Buddhist spiritual and religious significance in Taxila including the Dharmarajika Stupa, Sirkap, Taxila Museum besides and Takht-i-Bahi.
Pakistan has been the cradle of the Buddhist and Gandhara Civilization for well over 22 centuries. Buddhism left a monumental and rich legacy of art and architecture in Pakistan.
Despite the vagaries of centuries, the Gandhara region preserved a lot of the heritage in craft and art.
The Gandhara civilization flourished in the north-western region of Pakistan from the 6th Century BC to the 5th Century AD. The territory of Gandhara civilization and its heritage is a triangular piece of land about 100 km, east to west and 70 km north to south on the west side of the Indus river surrounded by mountains in the present day Pakistan.
The Gandhara School of Art is credited as being the first creators of Buddha in human form carved in stone, stucco, terracotta and bronze. They were mostly enshrined in monasteries and stupas throughout the Gandhara region.
A major portion of the invaluable heritage has been preserved in the museums and the sacred sites at their original locations.
