Black is the new ice cream

Want something more badass than the usual rainbow-like ice cream to cool your tongue with? Then this charcoal-black icy treat is what you’re looking for!
Served by the Little Damage Ice Cream Shop in Los Angeles, California, these villainous delicacies have simply exploded on Instagram. And according to the testimonies, these almond-charcoal flavored soft serve ice cream not only look awesome, they’re tasty as well!
It’s actually not the first time somebody made an ice cream to match that dark soul of yours, as last year people were queuing at Morgenstern’s Finest Ice Cream in New York to get their monochrome-dessert fix.
