State officials must implement govt policies: Vajira

State officials are duty bound to implement the policies of the government in power. That is what the Constitution expects of them and that is what the Establishment Code governing government servants say, Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardene said.
Addressing a ceremony to lay the foundation stone for the construction of a five storey-new building for the Jaela Provincial Secretariat, the minister said with the change of government, the President appoints ministers and permanent secretaries. The secretaries shoulder the responsibility of carrying out the policies of the government in power.
“No one found fault with state officials who carried out the policies of the Mahinda Chinthana during the past decade. It was the duty of government servants. The Mahinda Chinthana is no more and state officials are expected to carry out the combined policies of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe," he said.
Abeywardene said that there is a clause in the Establishment Code to punish state officials who fail to carry out the policies of the government.
Gampaha district MP Dr. Kavinda Jayawardene, former Speaker and UNP chief organiser Joseph Michael Perera, former Home Affairs Minister Felix Perera, Gampaha District Secretary and Home Affairs Ministry Additional Secretary Sunil Jayalath, Jaela Provincial Secretary E.M.S.B. Jayasundara, Provincial Council Members Srinath Perera and Nirosha Athukorala were also present.
