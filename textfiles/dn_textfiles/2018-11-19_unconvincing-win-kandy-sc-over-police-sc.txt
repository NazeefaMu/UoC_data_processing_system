Unconvincing win by Kandy SC over Police SC

Kandy Sports Club pulled off an unconvincing win against the Police Sports Club in their Dialog ‘A’ division league rugby match played at Nittawela yesterday.
Probably over confidence made them ignore the basics and play as a champion side. They had to produce hard work to outperform Police and win their second first round match by 32 points to 23.
Kandy from whom much was expected failed to deliver and did not make the most of all the possession. There were too many unforced errors from them.
Thanks to the superior pack of Kandy’s fly-half Arshad Jamaldeen who came in the 20th minute dictated proceedings after his team had endured a rugged opening quarter from the cops.
Kandy SC 32 (3 goals, 1 try and 2 penalties). Tries: Danushka Ranjan three, Yaqoob Ali one. Conversations and the penalties were off the boot of Thilina Wijesinghe and Arshad Jamaldeen.
Police SC 23 (1 goal, 2 tries and 2 penalties). Tries: Vageesha Weerasinghe two, Sachith Silva one and all kicking by Sachitha Silva. At half time Kandy SC led 17-10.
Referee: Sarath Madugalle.
