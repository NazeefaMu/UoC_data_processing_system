Inconsistencies of LG Election Bill will be removed: PM
Amendments to the Local Government Election Bill which are inconsistent with its nature will be removed during the committee stage of the debate to be taken up in Parliament on Thursday, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Parliament yesterday.
The Prime Minister said the proposed election system could be tested at the Local Government election. He invited all the members to establish an election system that could be accepted by all. “The government need not postpone elections,” he said. “Lets finish everything and hold elections without delay. All should help this endeavour,” he said.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said the there was a long debate in the country over a new election system.
“But as there was an opposition against the proposed system, the formulation of the new system delayed. We have been able to include 55 amendments to the Bill proposed by the Election Commission,” he said.
He said women Parliamentarians also have made a suggestion of increasing the women representation to 30 percent.
The Prime Minister made these observations in response to a query made on the amendments to the Bill by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake.
MP Dissanayake inquired into what the government intends to do with amendments which are not consistent with the nature of the Local Government Election Bill.
“You are saying you will bring new amendments to the Bill, but there are many amendments which are inconsistent with the nature of the Bill,” MP Dissanayake said.
The Speaker said the government assured that the amendments would be provided to the members by noon today. Joint Opposition MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara also raised a similar issue, but highlighted that the new amendments should be in the hands of the MPs so that they will have sufficient time to study them.
Leader of the House, Minister Lakshman Kiriella said the debate on the Local Government Election Bill will be taken up on Thursday.
The vote would be taken on the same day. He said amendments could be made even after passing the Bill.
Joint Opposition MP Dullas Alahapperuma said the members should know as to what are the amendments before the debate.
Minister Kiriella said the previous government bought the 18th Amendment to the Constitution in the morning and passed it in the evening.
“But we don’t do so. We have given enough time to propose amendments,” Minister Kiriella said.

“Constructions are being carried out in four phases. We offered the contracts in 2015. The total cost has been estimated at Rs. 265 billion. The Chinese Government provides loan facilities for the project,” the minister said.
Minister Kiriella said work on the Kadawatha-Kerawalapitiya section of the Colombo Outer Circular Highway extending to 9.3 kilometres has been expedited.
“A half of the constructions of the road would be completed by the year end. It will link the Colombo-Katunayake Expressway with the Southern Expressway,” he said.
Kiriella said 142 km of roads were constructed under the Priority Roads Project 3 - Phase I carried out with loans facilitated by the China Development Bank.
“The construction of 12 roads is nearing completion. The phase I of the project would be completed within this year. The project would be completed by 2018,” he said.
“Under the Integrated Road Investment Programme (iRoad), provincial and rural roads extending to 3,130 km and national roads extending to 400 km will be renovated under the ADB funds,” he said.
The minister said the new Kelani Bridge Construction Project would get off the ground in October and be completed by March 2020, adding that it would help ease traffic congestion in Peliyagoda and Orugodawatte. “The bridge will connect the Colombo commercial capital to the country’s expressway network.
