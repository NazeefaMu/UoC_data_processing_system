Sonakshi’s four new singles  to release soon

Sonakshi Sinha is geared up to impress the audience with her upcoming film ‘Happy Phir Bhag Jayegi’. But meanwhile, the actor is also exploring her inclination towards music. Previously, Sonakshi has judged music reality shows and also sung before. This time around, Sonakshi has recorded four different genres of singles with composer Vishal Mishra. As per reports, these singles are scheduled to release some time in the coming months.
Sonakshi Sinha’s first single ‘Aaj Mood Ishqholic Hai’ was recorded back in 2015. And post that, she managed to sing in few of her own films but never recorded her own singles.
The ‘Action Jackson’ star who has lent her voice for one of the songs in the third installment of ‘Yamla Pagla Deewana’, decided to record the singles too after an interaction with Vishal.
According to what Vishal stated in reports, the first single is expected to release in August. Describing the first single, the composer reportedly revealed that it is a Punjabi track with some international elements like dancehall, jazz, and even R&B.
He even reportedly mentioned that they are putting in a lot of creativity in videos as they are striving to make it look great.
The composer has also asserted that there will be more tracks that will be recorded in the forthcoming months. TNN
