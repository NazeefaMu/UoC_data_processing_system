Top tips for a healthy breakfast

Ever scrambled out the door without a chance to sit down and eat? Consider this: with a nourishing breakfast, we’re energised and ready to tackle our day - so here are some ways you can build this first meal and fuel yourself up.
Here are top tips for building a healthy breakfast:
1. Select quality complex carbs
For many, breakfast is often based around a carbohydrate food of some sort - think toast, cereal or porridge. When digested and absorbed carbohydrates break down into sugars in the body, and the rate at which this happens can be determined by the type of carbohydrate, as well as what they’re eaten with. Complex slow-releasing carbs supply us with a steady release of energy (e.g. porridge), while more refined processed options (e.g. sugary cereal), which often contain excess added sugars, are digested and released quickly, and can cause blood sugar crashes and poor energy levels.
2. Don’t forget protein
Out of the three macronutrients (carbohydrates, protein and fat), protein is the slowest to be digested. This means when we include protein-rich foods in our meal, it will help keep us feeling fuller for longer. Protein is also made up of essential amino acids, which serve as the building blocks of our body, and are essential for good health.
3. Nutrients are king
Our health is hugely influenced by the quality of our food. Starting our day with a high quality, nutrient-rich breakfast will nourish us deeply and is a habit that will cumulatively contribute to good health. Whole, unprocessed foods are naturally high in nutrients, and should make up the bulk of our diet.
Here are some more breakfast ideas to get you inspired in the kitchen:
- Smoked salmon and smashed avocado on high quality grainy toast.
- Fresh fruit, nuts, seeds, with a few spoons of coconut yoghurt or full-fat probiotic, unsweetened yoghurt.
- Omelette packed with colourful veggies.
- High quality muesli, with your favourite milk and a piece of fresh sliced fruit.
- Breakfast burrito - filled with scrambled eggs, sauteed veggies and salsa.
