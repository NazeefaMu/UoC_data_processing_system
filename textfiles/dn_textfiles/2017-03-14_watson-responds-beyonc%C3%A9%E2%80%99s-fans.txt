Watson responds to Beyoncé’s fans

Emma Watson responded to Beyoncé’s fans who called her a hypocrite for posing topless despite once discussing Beyoncé’s sexuality in the Lemonade visual album.
“As I was watching (the videos), I felt that her message felt conflicted in the sense that on the one hand she is putting herself in a category of a feminist, but then the camera, it felt very male, such a male voyeuristic experience of her,” Emma was quoted as saying, during a conversation with Tavi Gevinson.
“This is the part of my 2014 interview with Tavi where we talked about Beyoncé. My words are in bold,” Emma Tweeted and attached a screenshot of the interview. UsMagazine.com reports that in the full article, Emma said that she thinks Beyoncé was “making her sexuality empowering because it is her choice” and praised her for “doing it for herself and the control that she has”.
