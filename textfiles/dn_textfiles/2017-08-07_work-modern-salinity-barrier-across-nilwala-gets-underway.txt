Work on modern salinity barrier across Nilwala gets underway

The foundation stone to construct a salinity barrier across the Nilwala River was laid by Urban Development, Water Supply and Drainage Minister Rauff Hakkim, Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera, Urban Development, Water Supply and Drainaige State Minister Sudarshani Fernandopulle, Enterprise Development State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena, Kolon Samsung C & T Joint Venture Country Manager Jong Woo Yun and Education Provincial Minister Chandima Rasaputhra at Naimana South on August 6.
The salinity barrier will sense the salinity levels and open and close automatically to enable the waters upstream of the barrier to be used for drinking and agricultural purposes. The National Water Supply and Drainage Board will spend Rs 18,208 million on the project.
The Matara Stage IV Water Supply Project and a Korean firm M/s Kolon Samsung C & T Joint Venture were awarded the contract.
