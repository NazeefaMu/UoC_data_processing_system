Junior prefect seriously injured in alleged attack by senior prefect

A junior prefect attached to a leading popular school in Kandy was seriously injured and admitted to Peradeniya Hospital and later transferred to Kandy General Hospital following an alleged assault by a group of students led by a senior prefect of the same school around 1 pm on March 6.
The father of the injured student said his son had sustained injuries to the neck and face following the alleged assault and has made a complaint to Kandy Police about the matter.
