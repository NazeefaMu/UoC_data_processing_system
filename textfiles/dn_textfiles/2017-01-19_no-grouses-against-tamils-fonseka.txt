No grouses against Tamils: Fonseka

Highlighting the changes taking place in Sri Lanka between the majority and Tamils, Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka on Tuesday said that there are no grouses with the majority community in the northern Sri Lanka regarding the 13th Amendment.
"We have given that message to the majority community in the south also. There are no grouses with the majority community with the people in the north. We didn't want to make the same mistakes," Fonseka told ANI in an interview.
Fonseka asserted that the government is considering all aspects to go ahead with the 13th Amendment taking care of the legal and political issues.
"There are a few legal and political issues to a certain extent. We are determined that everybody in the country is given due place, equal place," he said.
Expressing hope that the current change in the social perspective Fonseka said, "We have mentally conditioned the country to live together. They understand that there must be reconciliation as one nation. But political devolution and other things are being discussed. Legal issues are there changing Constitution, referendums and various things are being considered. Things will fall in line." ANI
