Writ petition on Elpitiya PS election fixed for argument

A writ petition filed by the Democratic United National Front (DUNF) regarding the Elpitiya Pradeshiya Sabha election was yesterday fixed for argument by the Supreme Court.
On January 30, the Supreme Court issued an Interim Order preventing the Elections Commission from taking further steps to proceed with holding the election to the Elpitiya Pradeshiya Sabha, until the final determination of a writ petition.
Issuing an Interim Order on the Galle District Returning Officer, the Supreme Court had observed that there is ample reason to grant relief pleaded by the petitioners.
The Democratic United National Front (DUNF) was founded in 1990 by a group of United National Party dissidents. The party was led by the late Lalith Athulathmudali and Gamini Dissanayake.
Three members of the DUNF filed this petition in the Supreme Court naming Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya and several others as respondents. They sought an order in the nature of a writ of Mandamus directing the Returning Officer appointed for the Elpitiya Pradeshiya Sabha to accept the nomination paper delivered to the Election Officer by the authorised agent of the DUNF for the election of members to the Elpitiya Pradeshiya Sabha.
Three petitioners Vithanage Ariyaratne, Thilak Opatha, Ariyawansa Dissanayake (party secretary) had filed this petition naming Assistant Commissioner of Elections (Galle District), Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya and several others as respondents.
The nomination papers handed by the DUNF were rejected for the reason that they have been handed over by a person who is not the authorized agent.
President’s Counsel Srinath Perera appeared for the petitioners. Deputy Solicitor General Viveka Siriwardena appeared for the Election Commission.
