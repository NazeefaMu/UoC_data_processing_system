Former PM's rejection of President's decision leads country to tense situation - FNO

The Federation of National Organisations (FNO), in a statement issued on November 29, said a tense situation is building in the country owning to the former Prime Minister’s rejection of the constitutional decision made by President Maithripala Sirisena.
Therefore, the FNO requested President Sirisena to declare a state of emergency to prevent this tense situation from leading to clashes.
The statement signed by the FNO’s convenor Dr. Gunadasa Amarasekera said the relevant political party had the democratic right to withdraw from a national government.
Such a political decision will abolish the national government and the Cabinet, according to Section 46 (2) of the Constitution.
The statement said that in this situation, the President had two options. One is to reappoint Ranil Wickrmesinghe as Prime Minister again if he can command a majority in Parliament.
If that is not possible, the President can appoint another parliamentarian whom he thinks can gain a majority as the Prime Minister.
No one believed that the former Prime Minister, who has a long experience cannot understand such a simple provision in the Constitution. Similarly, if the former Prime Minister can muster majority support in Parliament, he could do so when Parliament meets on November 16 or nearby date.
Apart from this, the Attorney General too had endorsed the decision made by President Sirisena as constitutional and legal.
The challenging of the President’s constitutional decision has caused a constitutional crisis which may lead to clashes among parties resulting even in a civil disturbance.
This situation was building up at a time when an alleged conspiracy to assassinate the President and disrupt national security.
Therefore, the President is bound by the Constitution to prevent such a situation from arising.
