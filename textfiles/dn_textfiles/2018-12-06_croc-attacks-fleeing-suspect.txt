Croc attacks fleeing suspect

A suspected gambler who attempted to swim over the Kelani River to flee from police lost a part of his leg after he was attacked by a crocodile.
When the Seethawaka Police raided a gambling den in Gurugalla, Avissawella, several of those who were playing cards at the time fled the scene and the police gave chase. The suspect who was attacked by the crocodile was admitted to the Avissawella Hospital.
The raid was undertaken by Inspector K.M. Gurusinghe under the instructions of SP Upul Chandana Abeysinghe of the Seethawaka Police.
