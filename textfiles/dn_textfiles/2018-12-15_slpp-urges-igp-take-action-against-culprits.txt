Attempt to enter Lake House premises
SLPP urges IGP to take action against culprits

Sri Lanka Podujana Tharuna Peramuna (SLPP) yesterday urged the Inspector General of Police to take immediate measures to institute legal action against those who forcefully attempted to enter the Lake House premises on Thursday, soon after the issuing of the Supreme Court decision on the dissolution of Parliament.
Addressing the media at the SLPP office in Battaramulla yesterday, UPFA Matara District MP Kanchana Wijesekera said that a group of UNP activists, including a female member of the Kotte Municipal Council, a member of Dehiovita Pradeshiya Sabha and a Coordinating Secretary to a Gampaha District UNP MP created a conflict situation opposite the Lake House premises by attempting to forcefully enter the premises.
Condemning the behavior of these UNP activists, the MP urged the IGP to take immediate measures to take those responsible into custody.
