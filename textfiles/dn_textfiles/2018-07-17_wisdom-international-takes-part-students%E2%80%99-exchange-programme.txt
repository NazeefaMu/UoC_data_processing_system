Wisdom International takes part in students’ exchange programme

International student exchange programs are quite common in developed countries in Sri Lanka. We get news of such exchange programs usually taking place in top schools in the country.
A school in Beruwala has taken part in such a program with a high school in Germany. Wisdom International College, Beruwala, has come up successfully with this great feat.
They have commenced student exchange programs with Albert Einstein High School of Maintal, Germany. The first batch of 10 German students and teachers spent two weeks in Sri Lanka recently. They studied alongside their local counterparts at ‘Wisdom’ and even got the opportunity to tour many important places in the country, including the Peradeniya University, where they were able to have an audience with the Vice chancellor, Prof. Upul Disanayaka.
Now, nine local students from Wisdom International College - Imam Ashmal, Umar Ahmad, Umar Ayyash, Mohammed Haseen, Yusuf Ahmad, Mohammed Aamir Abdullah, Aisha Safa, Chamalee Pabasara and Fathima Nihla - with their chaperones - Samgeeth Samarajeewa and Chamoda Nilukshi - their Managing Director, Fowsar Hussain and Principal Shakeel Ismath left for Germany in April.
