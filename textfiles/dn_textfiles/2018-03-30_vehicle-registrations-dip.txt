Vehicle registrations dip

Vehicle registrations trended downwards in February perhaps due to a fewer number days in the month. Small cars continued to show strong momentum.
In the motor car segment registrations were slightly down to 4,881 units in Feb from 5,089 units in January and 2,091 units 12 months ago according to J. B. Securities. Brand new cars registered 778 units in Feb slightly down from 842 units in Jan and marginally down from 786 units 12 months ago.
Pre-owned cars accounted for 4,042 units in Feb down from 4,211 units in Jan and 1,305 units 12 months ago. Premium cars recorded 182 units in Feb down from 206 units in Jan but significantly up from 54 units in Feb – a bulk of the increase are coming from premium branded cars with 1L engines which are entry level models. Mercedes benz accounted for 34 units in the new category – 25 C class, 4 E class, etc. and 21 units in the preowned category mainly C class.
BMW posted a mere 5 units in the new category but 43 units in the pre-owned of which 24 units were 3-series and 6 units were 7-series with 2L hybrid engines. Audi recorded 60 units comprising of 21 A1 models and 17 A3 models – both of which have a 1L petrol engine.
The Registrar of Motor Vehicles (RMV) stats are now recording some of the much publicized super luxury cars that have been imported into the country– see attachment for some notable ones.
SUVs recorded 437 units in Feb significantly down from 583 units in Jan and marginally up from 361 units 12 months ago.
Hybrids recorded 2,681 units in Feb down from 2,980 units in Jan and significantly up from 1,330 units 12 months ago. Across all categories Suzuki accounts for 2,181 units which is an approximate 81.3% share – mainly 660cc engine vehicles.
“The former mainstay of the market being vehicles of engines between 1L and 1.5L has significantly contracted due to the unit duty method - a mid-size 1.5L hybrid engine car attracts a duty of LKR 3.75 million”.
Electric cars recorded 27 units in Feb up from 18 units in Jan and marginally up from 26 units 12 months ago.
3-wheeler registrations recorded 1,477 units slightly down from 1,544 units in Jan but up from 903 units 12 months ago. As a point of reference in Nov 2015 this number was 13,688.
The taxation on a three-wheeler is approximately LKR 420,000 pushing up the retail price to around LKR 750,000, financing has been restricted by the regulator to 25% on macro prudential grounds thus a potential buyer has to mobilize LKR 562,500 up front – a sum too far for many”.
2-wheelers recorded 27,139 units in Feb down from 31,694 units in Jan but up from 23,211 12 months ago.
Buses recorded 253 units in Feb down from 316 units in Jan and 340 units 12 months ago. Ashok Leyland is the market leader with a 36% share. Financing share was 91.3%.
