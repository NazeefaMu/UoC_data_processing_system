Non-science of politics in Cabinet shuffle

What is possibly the longest reshuffle of the Cabinet and other ministers has ended with hardly any signs of the use of science in the task, as promised so often in the wait for these changes. There are many questions that could be raised about science, if any, used in the allocation of portfolios, and the combination of subjects. The wider issue that has prevailed is the politics of continuance or survival of governance. The new ministers are tasked to take the government till the next general election in mid-2020, or at least till a new presidential poll in early 2020.
The ascendance of the UNP in the Cabinet is in keeping with the results of the last general election in August 2015, when the party led by Ranil Wickremesinghe, emerged as the largest party in parliament. The situation changed with the forming of the ‘unity government’ bringing a section of the SLFP to it, led by President Sirisena. The resignation of the 16 SLFP members, Cabinet ministers and others, who voted against Prime Minister Wickremesinghe at the recent No Confidence Motion, has certainly altered the structure of government, with President Sirisena’s SLFP members in government reducing to 25.
When Parliament opens its next session on Wednesday (8th) these 16 SLFPers will be seated in the Opposition benches, as an independent group, but under the leadership of President Sirisena, who remains Head of The Cabinet and Government. They have not moved to the Joint Opposition (JO) of Mahinda Rajapaksa, but do have a not so hidden attraction to them. The politics in the coming months will certainly show the stresses and tensions of this divided SLFP – many being pulled towards the JO, some remaining with President Sirisena, and some also drawn towards the UNP.
Play of politics
The Cabinet re-shuffle itself had little of political impact, in the context of the divisions within government, but it did show the play of politics in the voting of the NCM against Prime Minister Wickremesinghe. Apart from the reduction of SLFP members in the Cabinet, there is also the inclusion of Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, as the new minister of Higher Education and Cultural Affairs. He earlier left the Cabinet, as Minister of Justice and Buddhasasana, when the UNP called for his resignation, due to increasing criticism of delays in the legal process against those of the previous government allegedly involved in fraud and corruption, and his criticism of the economic relations with China. While very critical of government since his resignation, he voted against the NCM on the Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, with no support for the JO. His inclusion in the new Cabinet shows a play of the science or skill of political reconciliation. However, being in charge of Higher Education, apart from Cultural Affairs, certainly places him in a ministry of constant conflict among academics, students, and the public, a major area of conflict within government in the past three years. One has to see how much he has of the science of negotiation in divisive disputes.
In some show of the science of reality, President Sirisena did turn down a request by Prime Minister Wickremesinghe to include Ravi Karunanayake, former Finance and Foreign Affairs Minister, in the new Cabinet. His association with those involved in the Central Bank Bond issue is well known, and recorded in the related Presidential Commission Report, too. He has been publicly forgetful of the Penthouse rents he received from such sources. These matters did cause him to resign from his portfolio, while declaring his innocence. This request to have him in the present Cabinet was certainly not stuff of the science of clean politics.
The post re-shuffle politics will see new pressures from anti-Ranil SLFPers, with a push from the JO, for changes in key office- bearers of the SLFP and the UPFA – Duminda Dissanayake and Mahinda Amaraweera. They were appointed secretaries of the SLFP and UPFA by President Sirisena following disagreements with the former office-bearers - Anura Priyadarshana Yapa and Susil Premajayantha in 2015. In moves to bring about a government without any SLFP association with the UNP, the new ‘independent Blues’ seated in Opposition benches, will make moves for further breaks in government ranks.
This is an aspect of politics the SLFP’s official leader, President Sirisena, will have to pay special attention to, if the latest Cabinet shakeup is to have any impact on governance.
Green divisions
The UNP faced its own major crisis, with defeat in the recent local government polls, which it covered up well, especially the threat to its leader Ranil Wickremesinghe in the NCM. But not all promises of a major shakeup within the party, with effective restructuring have been wholly successful. A Politbureau is appointed, but the key positions are still in the hands of the Party Leader. The recent meetings of the Politbureau and Working Committee, did call for inner party democracy, and changes in the Party Constitution, especially on appointing of key party personnel.
The party saw strong opposition to the re-appointment of Ravi Karunanayake as Assistant Leader, which saw a very senior member, Joseph Michael Perera, from Kandana-Ja-ela leave the Working Committee. Sajith Premadasa, Deputy Leader too, had made serious criticisms of key appointments, especially that of the General Secretary. The new Gen. Sec. Akila Viraj Kariyawasam has given up Cultural Affairs from his portfolio as Minister, to give him more time for party work. This seems a clear endorsement of the wider opinion that the post of General Secretary should not be held by an active elected politician.
There is a strong body of its young membership that seeks reforms recommended by the Ruwan Wijewardene Committee on party reforms. There is a body of membership that sees many with good leadership qualities, kept out by the present trends of party organisation. There are reports of backbench members of parliament not attending party meetings in opposition to the trends against democracy within the party.
A call for a more democratic structure in the UNP is certainly important in the wider context of democracy within the country, where most political parties that claim to support democracy, function with doors closed to the democratic process. It will be interesting to know how far and fast this move for reform within the UNP will move, especially in the context of the upcoming Provincial Council polls and the later General Election.
Tea sympathy
The government has taken a major decision in favour of the tea and rubber industries, by lifting the ban of Glyphosate – the herbicide/weedicide – that has caused major threats and hardships, especially to the tea industry.
There will be objections, especially by Athuraliye Rathana Thera and those supportive of him, who call for organic fertilizers only. While the call for and use of organic fertilizer is certainly most useful, there is so far no scientific evidence produced to show that Glyphosate is or has been the cause of the Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Origin (CKDu) that does affect a large section of the population engaged in agriculture, and over which it was banned.
The search for the proper cause of this tragic illness must continue, and all facilities both economic and scientific must be provided for it. But, this does not mean that the major export –led agriculture crops- tea and rubber – must be endangered by the ban on Glyphosate, which has for many years been a major input of value to these industries, and thus to the national economy, and also the people engaged in these industries.
There is also a major threat of Sri Lanka losing the Japanese market for tea due to the Japanese objections of the use of MCPA - a Glyphosate substitute - used by the tea industry. The tea industry has already lost Rs 20 billion due to this.
It is also necessary to understand that the EU postponed any ban on Glyphosate for four years, enabling it to be phased out while a proper substitute or substitutes are found. Sri Lanka is certainly in no situation to face the harsh economic consequences of this ill-thought-out ban, which does not have full scientific support.
It is necessary for environmentalists and others interested in supporting organic fertilizer to carry on their research and publicity to bring about a proper understanding of the dangers that may prevail here from Glyphosate and also the actual threat of CKDu.
Why not 21A?
With the JVP’s call for abolition of the Executive Presidency, with its proposed 20th Amendment to the Constitution, which is getting increased public attention, there are also civic groups thinking in terms of a 21A, which will reduce or keep a proper control of the number of representatives elected to the Parliament and the Provincial Councils.
The example of what has happened with the numbers elected to the local authorities, shows the need for urgent action to bring proper democratic controls on the number of representatives elected to legislative and administrative bodies.
