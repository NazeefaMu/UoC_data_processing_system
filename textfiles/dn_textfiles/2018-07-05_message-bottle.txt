Message in a bottle

It’s amazing how one great writer can lead you to another great writer. I first met Neil Gaiman on the back cover of E. Nesbit’s ‘Five Children and It’. The publisher of Nesbit’s book had quoted Gaiman saying he loves her books and that she is one of the many women writers who had inspired him. Curious to know more about this other writer who thinks as highly of Nesbit as I do, I went in search of him and found out he is not just any writer but a writer after my own heart.
The most appealing thing about him, other than his enchanting books is his revelation that plays a central role in my career as a writer too. For, the universe has kicked me just as often as it seems to have kicked Gaiman. He confesses whenever he writes for money the book never becomes a success. “My first book,” he says “a piece of journalism I had done for the money, and which had already bought me an electric typewriter from the advance – should have been a bestseller. It should have paid me a lot of money. If the publisher hadn’t gone into involuntary liquidation between the first print run selling out and the second printing, and before any royalties could be paid. I shrugged...I still had my electric typewriter and enough money to pay the rent for a couple of months, and I decided that I would do my best in future not to write books just for the money. If you didn’t get the money, then you didn’t have anything. If I did work I was proud of, and I didn’t get the money, at least I’d have the work.
“Every now and again, I forget that rule, and whenever I do, the universe kicks me hard and reminds me. It’s true that nothing I did where the only reason for doing it was the money was ever worth it, except as bitter experience. Usually, I didn’t wind up getting the money, either. The things I did because I was excited, and wanted to see them exist in reality have never let me down, and I’ve never regretted the time I spent on any of them.”
What he has to say about being a freelancer too resonates with this freelancer you are reading right now. Gaiman acknowledges that “People keep working, in a freelance world, and more and more of today’s world is freelance, because their work is good, and because they are easy to get along with, and because they deliver the work on time.” (smile, smile, smile).
But there are hitches too. As Gaiman points out, “A freelance life, a life in the arts, is sometimes like putting messages in bottles, on a desert island, and hoping that someone will find one of your bottles and open it and read it, and put something in a bottle that will wash its way back to you: appreciation, or a commission, or money, or love. And you have to accept that you may put out a hundred things for every bottle that winds up coming back.” (This so succinctly sums up the lives of all  of us who work from home and have no idea when or how we will get our next assignment or what it will be about or whether we will be paid once the work is done.)
Gaiman, who turns fifty-eight this November, (he was born in Portchester, in Hampshire County and as a child,was bookish and broody) according to the New Yorker, has a pale face and a wild, corkscrewed mop of black-and-gray hair, and is always seen dressed in black: black socks, black jeans, black T-shirts, black boots, and black jackets whose pockets are loaded with small black notebooks and pots of fountain-pen ink in shades like raven. Having first started to write as a journalist today he is an unusually prolific writer of fantasy, fairy tales, science fiction, novels, comics, picture books, short stories, poems, and screenplays. Now and then, he also writes a song.
Critics say Gaiman’s books are genre pieces that refuse to remain true to their genres. Gaiman himself defines his readership as “bipeds.” According to the comic-book writer Alan Moore, “His best effects come out of people or characters or situations in the real world being starkly juxtaposed with this misty fantasy world.”
The model for Gaiman’s masterpieces is G. K. Chesterton; his work, Gaiman says, “left me with an idea of London as this wonderful, mythical, magical place, which became the way I saw the world.” Chesterton’s career also serves as a warning. “He would have been a better writer if he’d written less,” Gaiman says. “There’s always that fear of writing too much if you are a reasonably facile writer and I am a reasonably facile writer.”
As Dana Goodyear writes in the New Yorker, “In Gaiman, the horror is domesticated and made hygienic for contemporary tastes.” This is clearly visible in “Coraline” where an inquisitive girl with distracted parents, tests a bricked-up door in her house and finds that it opens onto a passageway. As with Alice’s rabbit hole at the other end is an alternate world: in this case, a house that is an idealized replica of Coraline’s own presided over by the other mother, who, Gaiman writes, resembles her real one— “Only her skin was as white as paper. Only she was taller and thinner. Only her fingers were too long, and they never stopped moving, and her dark red fingernails were curved and sharp.” In place of eyes, she has two black buttons...The story, thankfully, ends comfortingly: the heroine outsmarts the other mother and escapes; back at home, the last night of summer vacation, Coraline drifts into a peaceful sleep, realizing “there was nothing left about school that could scare her anymore.”
Even with this happy ending, when Gaiman showed an early draft to an editor in 1991, he was told it was unpublishable: far too frightening for kids. (Gaiman maintains that adults are more afraid of “Coraline” than children are.) The novel finally came out in 2002 and was an instant success.
Two other novels, “Anansi Boys” (2005) and “The Graveyard Book” (2008)—a retelling of Rudyard Kipling’s “The Jungle Book,” set in a graveyard—débuted at No. 1 on the New York Times best-seller list
in their respective categories, adult and children’s literature. Gaiman’s bestselling contemporary fantasy novel, American Gods, took the Hugo, Nebula, Bram Stoker, and Locus awards while The Graveyard Book, remains the only work to win both the Newbery (US) and Carnegie (UK) Medals –awarded by librarians for the most prestigious contribution to children’s literature.
Yet Gaiman remains a marginal writer. The New York Times waited to review “The Graveyard Book” for several months after its publication, by which time it had won the 2009 Newbery Medal, one of the highest honors in children’s fiction, and been on the best-seller list for eighteen weeks. The Times of London referred to him as “the most famous writer you’ve never heard of.”
Gaiman, however, is perfectly happy about living in the shadows. Looking back he feels he has had a remarkable ride - especially now as he reaches sixty and spends his days in a rural outpost in Wisconsin in a house that dates back to the eighteen-eighties. Inside, the house is divided into Dog and Cat, the latter the domain of five cats, including a blind one that lives in the attic. Dog belongs to an eighty-pound white German shepherd that Gaiman picked up on the side of the road and named Cabal, after King Arthur’s hound.
Ever ready to help creative youngsters, in the keynote address he made at the University of the Arts a few years ago Gaiman said, “The urge, starting out, is to copy. And that’s not a bad thing. Most of us only find our own voices after we’ve sounded like a lot of other people. But the one thing that you have that nobody else has is you. Your voice, your mind, your story, your vision. So write and draw and build and play and dance and live as only you can. The moment that you feel that, just possibly, you’re walking down the street naked, exposing too much of your heart and your mind and what exists on the inside, showing too much of yourself... That’s the moment you may be starting to get it right.”
