Cook with kids

Some mornings, making breakfast is the last thing you want to do. With holidays around the corner, if your children know their way around the kitchen, let them make their own morning food with these breakfast ideas. If you start your children off early in the kitchen, they'll learn the basic kitchen and safety skills they need to start making meals.
Toast and Fruit
A couple of bread slices complete with her favourite nut butter and a sliced up banana are a hearty way to start the morning. If your child has nut allergies — or just isn't a fan of nut butters — strawberry jam, or some butter and a little sprinkle of cinnamon and sugar paired with a piece of fruit are a few other easy options.
Cereal
Cold cereal with milk is a snap for your child to prepare. Just make sure to keep the milk in an easy-to-reach spot in the fridge, and practice pouring together to help avoid any major spills.
Hard-Boiled Eggs
Hard-boiled eggs are a simple make-ahead item that keep well in the fridge for up to one week. Your child can grab and peel one himself, and when paired with a piece of fruit or toast, eggs are a great protein-filled way to start the day.
Frozen Waffles
Whole grain frozen waffles are convenient for busy weekday mornings. Your child can simply pop one or two in the toaster, top it with cut up fruit and syrup, and enjoy!
Homemade waffles and pancakes can also be made over the weekend and frozen for a quick weekday warm-up.
