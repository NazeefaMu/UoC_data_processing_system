FR filed by Gnanasara Thera fixed for support

The Fundamental Rights petition filed by Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera seeking an Interim Order preventing Police from arresting him over allegations, was yesterday fixed for support by Supreme Court.
When the petition came up before Chief Justice Priyasath Dep and Justice Anil Goonaratne, the matter was fixed for support on June 22.
President’s Counsel Tirantha Walaliyadda with counsel Sasika Mithunaarachchi appeared for Gnanasara Thera.
Filing a Fundamental Rights petition through a counsel, Gnanasara Thera sought an Interim Order preventing the Organised Crimes Prevention Division from arresting him until the investigations against him concluded and advice of the Attorney General is obtained in this regard.
Gnanasara Thera has cited the OIC of the Organised Crimes Prevention Division and three others as respondents.
He further sought a declaration that the Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Article 12(1), 13(1) and 14(h) of the Constitution have been violated by the respondents.
The petitioner stated that there is an islandwide search to arrest him and Police teams have been deployed for the purpose.
On June 12, Gnanasara Thera was not present in Court regarding a Contempt of Court action filed against him over his alleged offensive behaviour at the Homagama Magistrate’s Court. The Court was informed that Gnanasara Thera was not appearing since he has death threats.
