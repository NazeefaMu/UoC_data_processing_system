SLAS musters 2,462 officers for sick note campaign

Individuals who visited government offices in the South, were inconvenienced as majority of staff were away on sick leave, under the sick note campaign launched by the Sri Lanka Administrative Service (SLAS) union.
The union had launched their campaign protesting delays in special allowance payments. Reports said nearly 2,462 SLAS officers had joined the sick note campaign.
