Ki and Ka  to star in ‘Life In A Metro 2’?

The Anurag Basu directorial, ‘Life In A Metro’, had hit the screens in 2007. It won critical acclaim and also performed well at the box-office. After years of wait, the filmmaker is finally here with a sequel of the film.
If latest reports are to believed, Bollywood’s Ki and Ka aka Kareena Kapoor Khan and Arjun Kapoor will star in the sequel.
A source told a daily, “Kareena Kapoor Khan will reportedly feature in one of the stories and Arjun Kapoor will also be a part of one of the plots. Their tracks are not connected is what we hear.”
We also hear that Anurag will most likely rope in good friend and musician Pritam for the sequel.
Other than this, Kareena will also be seen in Karan Johar’s recently announced ‘Takht’ in which she will be sharing the screen with Ranveer Singh, Alia Bhatt, Vicky Kaushal and Bhumi Pednekar. She will also be seen in ‘Good News’ opposite Akshay Kumar, which again is a Dharma film.
