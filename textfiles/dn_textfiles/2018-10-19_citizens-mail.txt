How NM handled strike situations
Strikes are of different actions. There is the token strike, the politically motivated strike, religiously provoked strike, community aimed strike, the genuine strike and the like. Amongst all the strikes there is the sudden wild strike of the private buses which should be condemned totally. The genuine strike should have reasonable remands and could organise it in the event all discussions have failed. Such a genuine strike should be arranged in a manner that will not push the people into great difficulties.
As of a private bus strike, if a bus crew is slapped by a passenger for the former’s aggressive behaviour or a policeman charges for his reckless driving or if the public thrash him or some other trivial reason the most despicable strike is promptly done. Thereby, the people undergoing inconvenience and hardship cannot be put in black and white.
There is a remedy for this deplorable situation for which following is my suggestion.
1. Let them launch a strike and seek the support of the other bus crew too if necessary.
2. If the strike is not reasonable the government need not care it.
3. The government should put out all the state buses, especially concentrating on the required areas.
4. One hour grace period should be given to the state employees both for their arrival and departure to their workplaces. The private sector should be requested to follow suit.
5. If these things are done, they will drop their strike and return to work.
6. Because the financial burden of the family is there, then the paying of finance for the bus is there and of other commitments as well.
We have seen how loaded buses are stopped just to pick up a passenger while speeding too to have added 10 or 15 rupees. When such is the greed for money how could the crew keep off from their services? They will also lose their ‘playing out’ from the bus owners exact earnings.
The late Dr. N. M. Perera, while he was a union leader, forwarded 21 demands to the then UNP government and staged several unsuccessful strikes. Amongst those 21 demands, many appeared to be quite unreasonable which were matters relating to salaries.
The government, therefore, did not respond to their demands and the hope of the working class was lost. However, when the jumbled ULF government was formed in the 1970s the Union Leader (NM) became the Minister of Finance having a golden opportunity of handling one of the powerful ministries. The anticipation of the working class once again boomed with greater satisfaction and hope that their leader turned Minister would heal their wounds.
But what happened was history. He not only refused the demands but also did order the ‘kicking out of strikers from their workplaces’. Even those who worked in banks, which were under his portfolios, were also surprisingly dismissed. This lesson was picked up by President JR and he did it to the “July strikers’.
Lastly, the recent railway strike has given a nasty experience to its commuters. Therefore, the government should train either locally or abroad members of the security forces to drive trains, handle the control room and other relevant sections to confront sudden inhuman strikes.
