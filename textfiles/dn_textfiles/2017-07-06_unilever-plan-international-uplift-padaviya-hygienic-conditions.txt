Unilever, Plan International to uplift Padaviya hygienic conditions

Unilever Sri Lanka and Plan International partnered a one year project aimed at improving the poor hygiene issues in the Padaviya division, by ensuring school children inculcate the lifesaving habit of washing hands with soap.
World Health Organization states’ Handwashing with soap at key points is the simplest and most effective way to save lives’. In 2008, the Global handwashing day was announced, which Unilever through its flagship brand Lifebuoy has celebrated every year since the commencement.
“Creating a healthy and child friendly learning environment for children at early ages is critical for their better growth. Hygienic habits that children learn in their formative years help them practice this behavior in their families and pass on the knowledge to society. When children are equipped with the right skills, they are the best change agents.” said, Sian Platt, Plan International Sri Lanka, Acting Country Director. “Our water, sanitation and hygiene programme is both school and community-led, which aligns with our child-centred community development approach.”
“We work to ensure children and community members have a voice and choice in the decisions that affect their lives, and that enable them to act as agents of change.”
“Furthermore, teaching appropriate skills and practices to promote good hygiene practices among school children is considered an essential part of our water, sanitation and hygiene promotion programmes, which is why we are pleased to partner with Unilever in supporting the school children of Padaviya”, Platt added.
Identifying the need for improved health in the region for a better tomorrow, Unilever Sri Lanka and Plan International worked together in the planning and implementing of the joint project to advocate for better hygiene through sustainable handwashing practices. Through the endeavor, 11 schools in Padaviya will receive a facility for handwashing , children between the ages of 5-12 will be educated on the habit of handwashing, positive re-enforcements will be carried out throughout the year to ensure the habit is created and adequate soap will be provided for all schools.
