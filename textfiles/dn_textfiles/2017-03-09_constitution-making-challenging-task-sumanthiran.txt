Constitution making, a challenging task: Sumanthiran

There are constant challenges in the process of formulating a Constitution that ensures equal right for every citizen, MP M.A Sumanthiran said.
He was addressing the International Women’s Day celebration organised by the Lakbime Mothers and Daughters at Independence Square yesterday. The theme of the event was “New Constitution–Leadership for women”.
“One of the key features of a struggle of the oppressed is to join hands with other people who are similarly oppressed.
The women together with the other people who are also oppressed should demand that all the people should be granted equal status in the country,”he said.
Sumanthiran said women’s struggle for rights are hampered by all the structures in society and that includes state, legal,administrative, social, family structure and the Constitution.
“All the above structures are designed to oppress women. We were promised that a new Constitution will be formulated and now we should make use of this opportunity for the betterment of all oppressed people in the country,”he said.
Sumanthiran further said that it will be an opportunity to come out of different oppressive circumstances that are placed by different people.
