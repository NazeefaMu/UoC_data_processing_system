Depression moving towards Tamil Nadu

The depression over the Southeast Bay of Bengal was located near latitude 6.5N, Longitude 88.7E at 05.30 am yesterday, approximately 850 km east–southeast of Trincomalee.
The system is very likely to move north–northwestwards and intensify further into a deep depression during next 12 hours and into a cyclonic storm during subsequent 24 hours.
The Naval and fishing communities are requested to be attentive about advisories issued by the Meteorology Department in this regard.
Showers or thundershowers will occur at times in the Northern, Eastern, North Central, Central and Uva Provinces. Mainly fair weather can be expected further over the rest of the island.
Fairly strong gusty winds at times up to 50 kmph and fairly cold weather can be expected over the island.
There is high possibility of heavy rainfall and rough seas with sudden increase of wind speed (up to 70–80 kmph) in the deep sea areas off the coast extending from Potuvil to Kankasanturai via Batticaloa and Trincomalee.
Fishermen are advised not to venture into the deep sea off the coast in these areas till Sunday.
Fishermen who are in these areas are advised to move to safer sea areas or return to the coast by midnight today.
