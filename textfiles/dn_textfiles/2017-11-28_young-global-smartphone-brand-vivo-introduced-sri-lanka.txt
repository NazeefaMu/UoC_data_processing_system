Young global smartphone brand Vivo introduced to Sri Lanka

Vivo, the international mobile phone maker ranked among the world’s top five mobile brands is entering Sri Lanka with its portfolio of next generation devices designed to serve the youth demographic.
Serving over 200,000,000 users worldwide in over 20 countries and regions presently, the brand is on an aggressive roll-out with frequent reach expansions into new markets.
A purpose-driven brand with a dedication towards innovation, Vivo has established six research centres around the world including San Diego to explore emergent technologies including Artificial Intelligence, 5G and photography algorithms.
The commitment towards research and innovation enabled the brand to launch the world’s first smartphone with a dedicated Hi-Fi chip for an unparalleled audio experience back in the year 2012, followed by the introduction of the world’s first 2K resolution mobile screen in the XPlay model in 2014.
Last year, Vivo introduced the world’s first smartphone with a 20 megapixel dual front camera in its flagship model - the V5Plus, redefining the standard for “selfies” in the market.
“We are not just another smartphone brand but a purpose-driven brand that pursues perfection to unlock joy for our consumers. We dare to pursue perfections with continuous technology and product innovations. As a brand, Vivo is about Camera and Music, and we will continue innovating to offer the best mobile photography and audio experience. We are also about professionalism, creativity and joy, and we aim to become one of the favorite brands of young consumers via superior innovation and communication,” stated the Vivo Headquarters in a statement released ahead of the entry to the local market. As a global brand with a conscious local presence, Vivo strives to better serve its local clientele in Sri Lanka through continued efforts to understand customer needs and deliver above expectations.
The flagship offering from Vivo is set to be introduced to the country in the near future.
