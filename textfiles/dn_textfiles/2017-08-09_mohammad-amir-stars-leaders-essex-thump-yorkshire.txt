Mohammad Amir stars as leaders Essex thump Yorkshire

LONDON, Monday: Unbeaten Division One leaders Essex thumped Yorkshire inside two days to strengthen their bid for a first County Championship title in 25 years.
Captain Ryan ten Doeschate's 88 took Essex from 188-8 to 231 all out before lunch - a first-innings lead of 118. A second superb spell of pace bowling in the match from Mohammad Amir (5-54) then saw Yorkshire bowled out for 150, and Essex eased to 34-2 for victory.
Pakistan paceman Amir was unplayable at times on a seamer-friendly pitch at Scarborough, finishing with career-best match figures of 10-72.
Essex now lead second-placed Lancashire by 49 points with five games left.
Alex Hales struck a superb run-a-ball 218 for Division Two leaders Nottinghamshire, to leave Derbyshire facing the prospect of a big defeat. Resuming on 93-2 in reply to the hosts' 220 all out, Notts declared on 508-9 after Hales' stunning knock.
Hales has been in superb form in recent weeks. The 28-year-old smashed 95 off just 30 balls in the T20 Blast on Saturday and scored an unbeaten 187 to take Nottinghamshire to victory in the One-Day Cup final at Lord's last month. Chris Woakes hit a half-century on his return from injury against Middlesex to give Warwickshire a decent chance of a first Championship win of the season.
The England all-rounder, who was out for two months with a side strain, made 53 as the Bears closed on 293-8 at Lord's - a lead of 258.
Skipper Tom Abell and Steven Davies put on an unbeaten 138 as hosts Somerset recovered from 96-4 to end day one in an improved position against Surrey. On a rain-hit day, Abell (88 not out) and Davies (68 not out) led Somerset to 234-4 before wet weather arrived.
