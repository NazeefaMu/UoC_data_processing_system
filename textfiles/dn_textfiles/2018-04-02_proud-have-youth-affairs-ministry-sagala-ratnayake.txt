Proud to have Youth Affairs Ministry: Sagala Ratnayake

“I am proud to have Youth Affairs Minister because it was under Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who has rendered a revolutionary service towards youth as the Youth Affairs Minister in the 1980 decade.
“This has vested a great responsibility on my shoulders to chart a better future for children,” Project Management, Youth Affairs and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayake said.
Minister Ratnayake was addressing youth participants attending the “Yovun Pura’ Youth Camp in Nikaweratiya at its closing ceremony on March 31.
"I have assumed this pride and responsibility with honour and prepared to work with you in future," Ratnayake said. Ratnayake, who said the Yovun Pura programme was a concept of the Prime Minister, added that the Prime Minister was in his youth when he planned it after assuming the Youth Affairs Portfolio. Minister Ratnayake said he visited youth from all districts attending the camp and observed their activities. During the inspection tour, he requested youth attending the camp to forward their ideas and suggestions to him. Everywhere, the youth emphasised that the camp concept was never an outdated programme.
Ratnayake said that today's youth were enjoying the fruits and results of the Prime Minister's concept and vision, but the time had come for them to think anew. The matters discussed with youth attending the camp would be incorporated into future programmes, the Minister said. Ratnayake said youth comprised a radical sectors of society. "As a government it was their duty to steer that radicalism in youth towards the right direction. Radicalism in youth brought a wave to create a massive political change in January and August 2015.
"The time has come to put a full stop to family rule and provide equal opportunities for all. Irrespective of politics, they should create a new system ensuring future security to the youth,” the Minister said.
