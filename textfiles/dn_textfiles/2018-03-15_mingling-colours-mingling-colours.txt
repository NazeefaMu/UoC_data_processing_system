Mingling Colours  Mingling Colours

Sugandhi Edirisinghe will hold an exhibition of her paintings at The Cutting Station, Walawwa, Ethul Kotte from March 19 till March 31. A passionate artist with an eye for design and colour, painting has been Edirisinghe’s lifelong pursuit. Having received formal training by Professor W. A. Ariyasena (retired Senior Lecturer, Institue of Aesthetics Studies) she takes inspiration from the beauty of nature, culture and belief. Making the paintings vibrant in colour, vigorous in structure and abstract in nature, her paintings are simultaneously decorative, bold and contemporary in appearance, yet provide a feast for the eyes in the richness of detail.
A graduate of the Artists Program of Thompson Education Direct, USA, Edirisinghe has excelled in fields such as water colours, oil painting and mixed media. Her paintings adore the walls of MAS Silueta- Biyagama, Orit Appeals Lanka (Pvt), Wickramaratne Distributors-Head Office, Speedmark Transportation Lanka, Upali’s Restaurant and Nawaloka Head Office Peliyagoda.
