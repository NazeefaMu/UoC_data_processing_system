Orphaned jumbos need milk

The Udawalawa Elephant Transit Home takes care of orphaned elephant calves. Of which, most of the calves were found wandering in forests with injuries.
They are being treated by veterinary surgeons at the Transit Home.
It has been found difficult by Transit Home officers to feed the calves as they require a large consignments of milk food frequently.
The Elephant Transit Home should be provided with milk and donations, Transit Home sources stated.
‘After a group of orphans reached a specific age, the Transit Home releases them with radio transmitter collars fixed around their necks to monitor their behaviour,’ a veterinary surgeon at the Elephant Transit Home said.
