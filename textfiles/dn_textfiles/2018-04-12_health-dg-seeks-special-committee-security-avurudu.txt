Health DG seeks special committee on security for avurudu

It is advisable to appoint a special committee to ensure the safety of the public, in addition to the organizing committees of Avurudu festivals to be held island-wide in the coming weeks, Health Services Director General Dr. Anil Jasinghe said.
Addressing a press conference held at the Health Promotion Bureau in Colombo, he said the organizers of Avurudu festivals should ensure the safety of all participants. They should check the breaks and tyres of bicycles that take part in races, reduce the height of the grease pole, place spring mattresses or similar material on the floor below the greasy pole and other places where Avurudu sports such as pillow fights take place.
There should be a first aid team with the required first-aid in every place where Avurudu festivals take place, he said.
According to Dr. Jasinghe, buses running on short distant routes should not be used for long-distance routes or to go on trips. Such buses may have technical faults and drivers of such buses are not familiar with unfamiliar long distant roads. Such reasons lead to road traffic accidents. Adults should be careful when lightning firecrackers and handling them with children. No one should drive under the influence of liquor, he added.
Since there had been a slight increase in dengue during the last few weeks, families visiting their hometowns should pay special attention to clean them, especially the mosquito breeding sites, he said.
