Under19 players to be fast tracked to the National side

SLC in a great initiative wishes to kick start a U19 Provincial tournament which is to be commenced on the 19 April.
The primary objective of this tournament is to fastrack young players with potential to the national side at their prime.
The tournament will feature 10 teams from 8 provinces playing in two groups. Sabaragamuwa Province will not have a team while Western Province will field three teams.
Some of the less-strong provinces have requested few stand-by players from Western Province and Southern Province to strengthen their teams. The tournament will be played in two-day format and the final will be a three-day encounter on May 10, 11 and 12.
Sri Lanka Cricket President, ThilangaSumathipala shared his views and revealed their plans on fast-tracking young players into the national team.
"At least one player will be picked out of this tournament, the most outstanding and most important player as per the selectors' view will be joining the Sri Lanka national team for the England tour next month.
We intend to keep this practice going as one schoolboy cricketer will be picked for the Australia series at home and the away tour of South Africa in December.
