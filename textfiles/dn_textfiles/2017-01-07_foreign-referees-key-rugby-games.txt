Foreign referees for key rugby games?

Some ‘A’ division clubs have written to the controlling body SLRFU stating that rugby needs good knowledgeable referees. Discussions are underway to get down international referees for key second round matches of the ongoing Dialog ‘A’ division league tournament.
Most of the cubs it is learnt are not happy with the refereeing during the current season.
Today, most of the problems at matches are due to the poor standard of refereeing.
The game is fast developing with most of the schools and clubs playing at the highest level and encouraging their players. The schools in the urban and rural areas too have taken up the game. The drawback of this fine game is in the refereeing.
