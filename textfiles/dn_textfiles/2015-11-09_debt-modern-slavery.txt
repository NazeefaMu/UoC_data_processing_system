Debt is modern slavery

“Oh my gosh! I was so busy. I didn’t have my lunch even.” This contemporary, yet fancy utterance is catching on like bushfire country-wide only to find hospitals bursting at its seams saddled with a stressful population struck with all kinds of sicknesses. The medicinal side effects apparently are far worse than the disease. Cashing in on this is a greedy breed minting money at others’ misery, opening up so called state of the art hospitals island wide - one of them being a former presidential biological link whose ‘selfless loving care of the sick’ can match his very successful war gymnastics as a ‘patriotic son’ of the soil which he now regrets, going on his own admission.
Lest I deviate from my mainstay, how come every Johnny has suddenly become so obsessed with work having hardly any time for even his meals? Good, if we are on the developmental fast track. But are we? Development at the cost of a population’s health is sure to lead us nowhere except the doldrums. Kurunegala is no exception to this ‘busy bug’ bugging in no small way.
All too suddenly, slumbering Kurunegala has awoken. The youth here have taken to buying all kinds of machinery and vehicles, tractors, disc ploughs, land masters, mini lorries, three wheelers, motor bikes and now cars as well. My inquiring mind insisted on how they got all the monies for all this luxury buying. Were they into politics? No. Were they big time mudalalis? No.
Leasing companies
Large scale financing is draining the energy of the youth here. They are all afflicted with sicknesses hitherto unheard of. In Kurunegala’s hinterland - oooops sorry, no such geographical entity exists any more - the kalagedi carrying women’s trouser progeny are seen riding pleasure bikes, fully made up, sunglasses and all. Tuition classes thrive. Come evening the doctor and tutor are on par with their soaring clientele.
The endless crowd that seek their assistance enables them a super grade private practice. It is big status to be seen at the evening channel service than to see the same doctor in the rural hospital. The wallet-fattened doctor glides in his limousine and when he arrives all stands to attention, far removed from the respect he would get in Colombo. Every few yards, a pharmacist mints money on doctors’ prescription. The crowd is the financier’s clientele, the youth and not the elderly. The doctor would even tell you which pharmacy to patronize for obvious reasons. Both he and the pharmacist are obese with their newly found riches and would not exist if not for the leasing companies to whom the stressed out, sick youth are neck deep in debt.
Nimal a weed cutter tells me he has little sleep at night. His tractor’s constant whirring has affected him. The dust has even compelled him into breathing problems. His wife will soon be on her second delivery. So Nimal has got to work even harder. His biological asset in seven months’ time will turn into a burden. His bundle of joy is a tale of sorrow. Recently, the finance company even seized his tractor for payment default. To prevent a repetition, he has got to get his act together. The leasing agent has a monthly Rs 40,000 hold on him.
Tharanga, another victim of finance, is not spared the agony of his routine trek to the Dambulla economic centre. Vegetables are his line of living. He has to somehow make it into the financier’s purse a neat monthly 28,000 for his Bolero truck. Vegetable alone costs him Rs 300,000 a month while fuel around Rs 10,000. He complains of acute gastritis and appetite loss.
Making life a veritable hell hole are their wives driving them up the wall. Tharanga’s wife insists on a new house. Not content with the truck, she is constantly pestering him for a car. “Mage gaanita pissu. Mama finance gevaaganna balanava. Eyaata car onalu,” he told me in the course of conversation at the pola.
Gilbert's wife drags him out of the house, stands opposite the neighbour’s and asks: “aren’t you ashamed to live in that hovel of ours? This man’s son and Sarath are in the same class.” Gilbert’s son now is a regular absentee in school because of the stigma in living in a wattle and daub. After a couple of hard stuff, Gilbert prefers the cemetery’s solitude to his wife’s incessant nagging.
If not for a private milk company paying for Jayaweera’s milk hire, things may have been far worse. Yet the daily drive to Narammala is no ‘piano’. The Maha season has started and following this exhaustive drive mind you daily, Jayaweera is back ploughing every field in the locality to beat the financier’s deadline the monthly Rs 30,000.
The thatched village ‘kades’ have been neatly replaced with modern shops on par with those in Colombo and most women keep shop and men scrape coconuts. A role changing, upwardly mobile class striving for social prestige as in Colombo is on the rise. Cradling the majority of Colombo’s population is this evolved class from the village that go to make up Colombo’s socio/ political/ business and religious elite a reminder of the removal of caste based jobs in 1848 under the Colebrooke / Cameron reforms that have placed them in positions they least expected.
Children here have to walk to school. Van uncle has taken over their transport. He is also the financier’s victim for if not for the van what would he do to keep the wolf off the door? Walking to school is shameful. And so every child has some extra pounds around his waist. Some can hardly carry themselves.
Stiff competition
Close upon night comes ‘choonpaan’ hovers around to the strains of ‘cuckoo waltz’, once the possession of only the sophisticated urban elite. The financier juggernaut grips him as well. Pastries, pies patties and cutlet (no longer pronounced cutlis) which their mothers knew not, have rested firmly on their taste buds most unwilling to accommodate that plate of rice so familiar to the farming community. Even for breakfast shorteats have come to stay. Pittu, kola kenda and string hoppers now take a backseat.
Stiff competition, social prestige, false values, vanity, the stigma of poverty and whatnot have enveloped the youth here apart from the rising cost of living.
Neeliya, a well informed source, tells me that bank loans for large scale weddings are a common fallback state, for social prestige is number one priority.
They are into an ad hoc kind of progress only to end in progress retarded.
They need counselling but who is to fill that space? A ministry assigned particularly for this purpose with a dedicated team will for certain bring relief to these disgruntled youth whose elephantine problems remain regretfully unresolved.
Also can’t the state’s benign eyes enable their tasks into easier and lighter arena by mitigating the imposing role of marauding financiers and leasing companies? Life does offer a second chance. So why not an alternative for these youth - the much valued societal backbone? It’s time that Yahapalanaya steps in for it must be evergreen in the minds of the present power wielders that if not for the country’s youth, they would have ended up a lost entity.
The country is in debt to international donor agencies and its people to finance companies. When will this country and its people ever find relief from the misery of debt?
Over to you Mr. President!
