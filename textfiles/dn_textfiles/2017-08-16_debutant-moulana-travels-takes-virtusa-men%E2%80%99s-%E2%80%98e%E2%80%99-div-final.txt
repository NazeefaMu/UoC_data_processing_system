Debutant, Moulana Travels takes on Virtusa in men’s ‘E’ Div. final

Debutant, Moulana Travels and Virtusa booked their berths to play in the final of the Mens ‘E’ division in the 27th MSBA League Basketball Tournament 2017, continued at Sir Edward Henry Pedris Stadium, Colombo 5.
In the semi finals that were closely contested, Virtusa snatched a 38/36 win over WNS Global in extra time and Moulana Travels with a strong second half, managed to overcome the fancied CDB, 46/35.
Virtusa led 21/19 at half time, but WNSG caught up on the nick of time to level scores, 30/30 at full time. The match winners for Virtusa were Vishan Andrew (12), Minul Wimalagunaratne (12) and Kasun Ranasinghe (10). It was unfortunate for WNSG that their star shooters, Nipuna Samarakoon (15) and Rifkhan Nilufir (15) were fouled out during the dying moments of the game.
CDB went full steam as they led 24/9 at half time, but their tanks went dry in the 2nd half and Moulana Travels put their foot to the pedal through their dynamic point guard Inzamam Hassim (16) and Shelk Moulana (15) to give them a memorable entrance to the final. Dinuka Gamage (10) played a hard game for CDB.
