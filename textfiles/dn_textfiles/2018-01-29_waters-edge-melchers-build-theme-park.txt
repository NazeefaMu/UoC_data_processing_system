Waters Edge, Melchers to build theme park

Waters Edge, together with Melchers Project Management Pte Ltd announced plans to build a theme park overlooking the waters of the Diyawannna.
Chairman Chamath de Silva said, “In an attempt to become the premier entertainment hub of this nation Waters Edge together with Melchers Project Management Pte Ltd, will create a theme park which will be family-oriented and a place where children and adults can enjoy themselves on state-of-the-art attractions.”
Fantasy Island at the Edge will feature a culmination of the three main elements of air, water and land.
The Giant Ferris Wheel will take revelers to the skies, while the water park will include thrilling rides and the snow chalet will take you to an ice kingdom of wonder.
The initiative of the entertainment hub and theme park is the vision of Minister of Megapolis and Western Development Patali Champika Ranawaka and part of the Megapolis Development plan.
Bringing many a dream to life the Snow Chalet will be built to German Technology and will provide an unique indoor snow experience. The water park is designed so that even a non-swimmer can enjoy the slides, waterfalls, water climbs, surprise fountains and so much more.
The 40-meter high Ferris Wheel will be one of the main attractions at the Fantasy Island with a viewing tower that will provide a bird’s eye view of the Sri Lankan coastline as well as the central hills. Visible from anywhere in Colombo, this will truly be the “main attraction” at the theme park.
With a capacity to hold 300 children per time the water park will also be ideal for school excursions and even birthday parties.
The development project aims to create a recreation, leisure and sports facility on the far side of the water front. The center will facilitate more adventure sports such as kayaking, rowing and wind surfing among many others.
This project will be coordinated and supervised by the Strategic Initiatives Department of Waters Edge.
