Former President should worship PM  for saving him from electric chair: Thalatha


Expenditure on fan fare projects that had not brought any financial dividends by the previous regime, created a financial crisis in the country, said Justice and Prison reforms Minister Thalatha Atukorala.  

She made this observations, while addressing a meeting at Embilipitiya, following the inauguration of the Embilipitiya Padanangala mammoth water supply project.   
She also said that the previous regime had set up a sea port without ships and an air port without planes, but never concentrated on providing water, the most essential commodity to the people.  
"The Buddha Sasana was protected for the past 2,500 years due to the efforts of the Maha Sangha as such our interference is not essential," the Minister said. 
"If the necessity arises, we would intervene," she said.   She also said that there is an allegation that our heroic soldiers are meted out step motherly treatment by the present regime which is a baseless allegation.  "Prior to attending to other duties, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, should have worshiped a picture of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe for having saved him from the electric chair," Minister Atukorala said.   
The minister debunked speculations that the country's economy was collapsing and requested the citizens of the country not to panic, because the Central Bank could handle the country's current exchange rate and the debt situation.  
A sum of Rs. 345 million has been allocated for the water supply project, while five hundred families would be benefit as a result.
