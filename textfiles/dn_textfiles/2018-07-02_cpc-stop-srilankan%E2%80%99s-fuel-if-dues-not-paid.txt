CPC to stop SriLankan’s fuel, if dues not paid

Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) Chairman Dhammika Ranatunga has said that the CPC will stop supplying fuel to SriLankan Airlines if its dues are not settled by this Wednesday (4).
The Petroleum Resources Development Ministry said recently the CPC was struggling financially due to unsettled debt from both Sri Lankan Airlines and the Ceylon Electricity Board.
National carrier SriLankan Airlines reportedly owes the CPC Rs 12 billion while the CEB owes Rs 55 billion.
