SL unitary status at risk if Executive Presidency is abolished: Rathana Thera

If the existing Executive Presidency is abolished, the unitary status of Sri Lanka will be abolished automatically. According to the Supreme Court judgement given by Deshamanya Suppiah Sharvananda in connection with the 13th Amendment, the unitary status of the country is kept and protected by the powers of the Executive President, Senior Consultant to the President and MP Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera said.
Addressing a press conference at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute in Colombo yesterday, he said they will not let anyone to abolish the unitary status of the country.
The new constitution is the idea and views of a handful of people who promoted and supported LTTE terrorism in the past. They formulated the new constitution. It is full of separatist moves. Now they are trying to pretend that it is the view of all Sri Lankans which is absolutely false, he said.
According to Ven. Rathana Thera, no one promised to completely abolish the Executive Presidency. “What was promised was to cut down harmful powers. In page 10 of the ‘Maithri Paalanayak’, the President very cleanly states that he will not completely abolish the Executive Presidency. If the new constitution completely abolishes the Executive Presidency, the unitary status of the country will automatically be abolished, the Thera said.
“The President clearly promised not to amend parts of the constitution which require approval through a referendum. I was with Ven. Maduluwawe Sobhitha Thera at the time when he said the Executive Presidency should be abolished but I did not hold the same view on the topic. At that time I clearly stated my view which was to amend the harmful powers of the Executive Presidency,” he added.
