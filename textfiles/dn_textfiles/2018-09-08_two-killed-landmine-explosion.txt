Two killed in landmine explosion

Two youths engaged in demining activities in Mankulam died due to a landmine explosion on September 3.
Speaking to the Daily News, Brigadier Ananda Chandrasiri (Rtd) Director / Programme Manager Delvon Assistance for Social Harmony (DASH) said one of the victims, Pathmanathan Dileepan, 28, died upon admission to hospital.
The other, R. Nitharshan, 25, succumbed to his injuries while being treated at the Vavuniya Hospital on Wednesday.
Brig. Chandrasiri said, “We believe that this was a rifle grenade that exploded while the two were clearing a battle area in Mankulam.” He said Nitharshan was initially admitted to the Kilinochchi hospital and later transferred to the Vavuniya hospital for treatment. Mankulam and Vavuniya Police are investigating.
Meanwhile, Nitharshan’s wife was admitted to the Vavuniya hospital following a suicide attempt due to unbearable grief caused by the death of her husband. However, Brig. Chandrasiri said she was now out of danger.
DASH has suffered a few casualties during the past 14 months.
