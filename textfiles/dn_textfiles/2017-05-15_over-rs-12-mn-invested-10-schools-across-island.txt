Over Rs. 12 mn invested in 10 schools across the island

CDB’s flagship CSR project marks ten years
It has been ten years since Citizens Development Business Finance PLC (CDB) began its unique CSR initiative of ‘Pariganaka Piyasa’ aimed at making IT literacy inclusive across the nation.
Based on the platform of equality of knowledge, CDB launched this flagship CSR project to develop, improve and uplift ICT education in under served and under privileged schools.
A feature that enhances the uniqueness of Pariganaka Piyasa is the fact that the IT Laboratories double up as a Community Centre for the area, enabling residents to enhance their IT knowledge as well.
Each year, CDB works towards presenting an IT laboratory to a deprived school, working in conjunction with the Ministry of Education and Zonal Education officials.
Once selected, the school receives a new IT laboratory equipped with all relevant technological infrastructure including new computers with licensed software, computer tables, chairs, scanners, printers and multi-media facilities which empowers young people and in the larger sphere the residents of the area to be interlinked with the rest of the world.
Given that ICT is now a subject being offered at the GCE Ordinary Level examination and is a compulsory life tool for everyone, CDB’s investment of over LKR 12 Mn in these ten schools offers a larger gift to communities in the longer term.
CDB’s tenth anniversary of Pariganaka Piyasa was marked with the gifting of an IT Laboratory to Kehelpannala Kanishta Vidyalaya in Hemmathagama Mawanella in the Sabaragamuwa Province.
The ceremony was attended by CDB senior management, school and zonal education officials, students, parents and well-wishers, CDB added further value to the initiative by conducting an ICT awareness programme at the school. Officials from the Mawanella Educational zone were briefed on the advantages of the programme and the importance ICT plays in the larger scheme of national development.
CDB is a leading non-banking financial institution serving both rural and urban communities through a network of 69 branches across the country.
