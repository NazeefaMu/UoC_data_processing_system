SL Navy assists distressed foreign sailing ship

Sri Lanka Navy's Advanced Offshore Patrol Vessel SLNS Sayurala assisted a foreign yacht named "Sandetie" which had distressed in deep seas 72 nautical miles off Galle Light House on Saturday April 14.
The Navy Spokesman Commander D. M. D. C. Bandara told the Daily News that the yacht flying a French flag had four French nationals onboard. The two men and two females had sailed from Trincomalee harbour and was heading to their next port of call in Iceland when they had faced this mishap.
The yacht was in distress due to an engine failure and after receiving this information, the Sri Lanka Navy promptly dispatched SLNS Sayurala for the rescue of the yacht in distress.
The rescued ship with its crew was towed to Galle harbour and subsequently handed over to a private shipping company for onward action.
