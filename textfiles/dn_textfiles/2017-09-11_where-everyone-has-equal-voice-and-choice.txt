Where everyone has an equal voice and choice!

International Day of Democracy will be celebrated on Friday September 15, this year. In 2007 the United Nations General Assembly resolved to observe this day with the intention of promoting and upholding the principles of democracy and invited all member states and organisations to commemorate the day in an appropriate manner that contributes to raising public awareness.
It is meant both as a celebration of democracy and as a reminder that the need to promote and protect democracy is as urgent now as ever. This year’s theme of democracy and conflict prevention focuses on the critical need to strengthen democratic institutions to promote peace and stability. A more integrated approach to foster resilient societies calls for effective and inclusive democratic governance with respect for human rights and the rule of law.
A universal value
This year’s Democracy Day coincides with the observance at UN Headquarters of the International Day of Peace, under the theme of ‘Peace and Democracy: Make Your Voice heard.’ The theme for this year’s celebration is democracy education, the process of ensuring that all peoples of the world fully understand their rights and responsibilities in decision-making. The subject of this year’s theme is essential for the long-term success of democracy, especially in countries that have recently transitioned to more democratic societies.
It is only with educated citizens that a sustainable culture of democracy can emerge. Democracy is a universal value based on the freely expressed will of people to determine their own political, economic, social and cultural systems and their full participation in all aspects of their lives. The UN has been stressing the continuing need to promote democratisation, development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.
Democracy is a form of government in which all eligible citizens participate equally - either directly or through elected representatives - in the proposal, development and creation of laws. It encompasses social, economic and cultural conditions that enable the free and equal practice of political self-determination. Democracy contrasts with forms of government where power is either held by one person, as in a monarchy, or where power is held by a small number of individuals, as in an oligarchy.
No consensus exists on how to define democracy, but equality, freedom and rule of law have been identified as important characteristics since ancient times. These principles are reflected in all eligible citizens being equal before the law and having equal access to legislative processes. For example, in a representative democracy, every vote has equal weight and the freedom of its eligible citizens is secured by legitimised rights.
The empowerment of citizens
Democracy is a universal value based on the freely spoken and expressed will of people to determine their own political, economic, social and cultural systems in all aspects of their lives. Evolved over centuries, democracies share many common features, but cannot be reduced to a single model. In short, democracy pertains to the idea that everyone has the right to have their own beliefs and to say and write what they think.
The date chosen for Democracy Day corresponds to the adoption in September 1997 by the Inter-Parliamentary Union of a Universal Declaration on Democracy. That Declaration affirms the principles of democracy, the elements and exercise of democratic government and the global scope of democracy.
Activities carried out by the UN in support of efforts of governments to promote and consolidate democracy are undertaken in accordance with the UN Charter and only at the specific request of the member states concerned. A review of democracy in people of all backgrounds and nations are invited to help raise awareness for the purposes of democracy. In short, it is a reminder to governments, schools and workplaces everywhere that the hallmark of successful and stable democracies is the presence of a strong and freely operating civil society in which government and civil society work together for common goals for a better future.
One of the strongest global trends today is the empowerment of citizens and their desire for dignity and freedom. It is quite appropriate then for us to celebrate the strengthening of citizens’ voices for democracy.
The role of the citizen in improving the quality of democracy and in political and institutional reform is fundamental. During the past year alone the world has witnessed many examples of citizen-led movements across all continents demanding more responsive government and unless democracy responds to its citizens, it faces a major crisis. When powerful citizen movements spring up as a response to socio-economic crises across all continents, this is a clear call that ‘politics as usual’ needs to be re-examined.
Clear aspirations
Citizens have always been the driving force behind democratic change and international actors should respect their leadership in building their democracies. Citizen-led assessments provide citizens the needed spaces for dialogue on matters concerning their democracies. It is through citizen-led and owned democracy assessments that they can periodically assess the quality of their own democracies and build consensus around an agenda for broadening and deepening their democracies.
The citizen-led approach to assessing democracy is founded on the conviction that all people including women, youth, minorities, persons with disabilities, indigenous people, the poor and marginalized – know their democracies well and have clear aspirations of how they would like them to develop. They are viewed to possess legitimacy, which external actors are seen to be lacking, to make judgements about the quality of their democracies, debate emerging issues and build consensus around an agenda for broadening and deepening their democracies.
Democratic governments are accountable. Officials and politicians are answerable for their decisions and actions. This reduces the opportunity for corruption. Democracy also subjects governments to the rule of law, which means the law treats everyone, including the government, equally. Rule of law is important because, while it respects the will of the majority, it also protects the fundamental rights of individuals and minority groups.
Civil society is the oxygen of democracy. Civil society acts as a catalyst for social progress and economic growth. It plays a critical role in keeping Government accountable and helps represent the diverse interests of the population, including its most vulnerable groups.
Yes democracy has many forms but the most important part never changes, giving everyone a voice. When people engage in the democratic process they have a say in the decisions that influence their lives. Democracy can be found everywhere, from governments creating laws to friends deciding on what game to play.
