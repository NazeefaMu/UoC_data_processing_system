These incidents have often turned what should be a fulfilling, fun and memorable university career into something frightening and distressing.
Since many of us (students, academics, non-academic staff and administrative staff) spend a lot of our time on campus, we all have a responsibility to ensure that it is safe and secure for all of us. At the same time, it is important to have in place various initiatives to help us feel safe and secure.
