It is expected all state hospitals to be included in the network under the programme.
Under the eHealth Programme, patients admitted to state hospitals get registered in a computerized system and their medical reports are computerised as well. The Health Ministry has set up a WHO supported National eHealth Steering Committee in this regard, he said. The committee drafts national e-Health guidelines and standards. A specialised workforce was established to manage health information.
