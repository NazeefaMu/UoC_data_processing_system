SLAF drones monitor Wilpattu – Deputy Minister

The Sri Lanka Air Force carries out drone surveillance to check if illegal felling is taking place in Wilpattu and other forest areas in the North and East, Mahaweli Development and Environment Deputy Minister Ajith Mannapperuma said yesterday.
If anyone engages in clearing jungles and illegal felling of trees, Air Force personnel inform the Wildlife Conservation Department and other relevant authorities to initiate action against them, the Deputy Minister said at a media briefing in Colombo yesterday.
Air Force personnel have undertaken drone surveillance for the last two weeks while Civil Defence Force personnel are deployed to monitor Wilpattu for any illegal activity. A classified report based on their observations will be submitted to President Maithripala Sirisena in this regard, the Deputy Minister said.
Deforestation in Wilpattu has occurred on land given to several individuals by the previous government and not by this government. President Maithripala Sirisena abolished all these permits through a circular after he came into power. No forest land has been cleared after this government came into power in 2015, he said.
During the war, forest cover in the North and East areas remained up to 60 percent as there was no human activity in those areas. But, after the war, many people came forward as owners of these lands.
A committee headed by former Minister Basil Rajapaksa distributed these lands to some of these people who claimed ownership, the Deputy Minister said.
“But, we have stopped all theses illegal activities and the authenticity of land ownership will be checked by two committees set up at district level and national level,” he said.
Deputy Minister Mannapperuma said that the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has also emphasised that the deforestation rate in Sri Lankan is much less compared to the rising population in the country.
