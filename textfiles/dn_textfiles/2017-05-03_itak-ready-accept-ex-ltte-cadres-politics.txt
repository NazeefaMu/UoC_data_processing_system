ITAK ready to accept ex-LTTE cadres into politics

The leader of the ITAK and Jaffna district parliamentarian Mavai Senathiraja stated that they are prepared to admit rehabilitated ex-LTTE cadres in to the political stream.
He was speaking at the 40th death anniversary commemoration of founder of the ITAK S.J.V. Chelvanayagam held at Kaluthavalai Cultural hall, Batticaloa organized by the Paddiruppu branch of ITAK recently.
Speaking further he said their proposal to have a Muslim Chief Minister for the Eastern Province was opposed by the Muslims. If the proposal was accepted it would have facilitated the merger of the North and East.
"Following the non violence method of Thanthai Selva, the ITAK is fighting for the rights and privileges of the Tamils in a forceful manner. It is to give a proper place for the Tamils that the ITAK is cooperating with the good governance regime and we are intent on the merger of the North & East," he said.
Leader of Opposition R. Sampanthan, Presidential Counsel and Jaffna District TNA parliamentarian M.A. Sumanthiran , Batticaloa District TNA parliamentarians S. Yogeswaran, G. Srinesan, S. Viyalendran and Eastern Province Agriculture Minister K. Thurairajasingam and Provincial Councillors participated.
