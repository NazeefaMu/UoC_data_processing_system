Keeping your nutrition levels right

Today the Head of the Department of Nutrition, Medical Research Institute, Ministry of Health and visiting Consultant Medical Nutritionist attached to the National Hospital of Sri Lanka and the President of the Sri Lanka Medical Nutrition Association Dr. Renuka Jayatissa (M.B.B.S, M.Sc, M.D, FPGIM, FCCP) talks about malnutrition. During the recent past there was a widespread dialogue in the country about the nutrition status of Sri Lankan people. Here is all that you need to know about malnutrition.
Q: What is malnutrition ?
Malnutrition defines both under nutrition and overweight or obesity. Both extremes will be classified as malnutrition.
Q:What cause malnutrition ? affects whom and why ?
Dr Renuka Jayatissa
Children are more vulnerable for both under nutrition and overweight. It spreads from infancy to adolescents. There are three main causal factors for under nutrition;
1. Immediate due to poor feeding practices and prevailing diseases which reduce the appetite but the needs are high during this period.
2. Underlying: food insecurity due to availability, affordability, accessibility of food; poor caring practices due to poor maternal or care givers knowledge and less time; inaccessibility to health services and poor sanitary practices.
3. Basic causes - economic structure and the country situation.
Overweight is also due to excess consumption of fat, sugar and less physical activities.
Currently Sri Lanka is undergoing nutrition transition and both sides of malnutrition is prevailing in the society.
Q: What are the symptoms of malnutrition and what is the impact on overall health ?
Underweight children exeperience repeated illness due to poor immunity, physical growth will be delayed and do not get optimum physical and mental growth; may affect cognitive development and less IQ. Efficiency and productivity will be low.
They will be underweight as women and then underweight pregnant women and deliver low birth weight children. Long standing underweight will cause stunting with inadequate height for the age. Stunted children are prone to get overweight in the future.
Q: What can be done to treat malnourished children and adults ?
They need more energy, protein, vitamin and minerals to come out from under nutrition. They need a specially formulated diet or supplements.
They should follow up monthly to monitor if the situation is getting better or worse. If the situation is not improving there is a need to check whether it has affected their weight for height and height for age of children and BMI of adults. If the response is poor with feeding an investigation for underlying diseases should be done.
Q: How can we prevent malnutrition in children and in adults ?
Preventing should start from the womb, mother should eat properly to gain adequate weight to have a adequate birth weight for the child. Then the child’s growth should be monitored monthly using the growth chart provided by the hospital. If there is slight faltering with the growth appropriate steps should be taken to correct it.
Age appropriate feeding for children;
Exclusive breastfeeding up to 6 months; quality nutrient dense food from 6 months of age, and breast milk should be a part of the meal not the main meal. Increase the number of meals to 3 main meals and 2 snacks which include cereals, vegetables, fruits, pulses, animal food in the daily diet. Iron rich food should be given everyday.
For adults - 3 main meals and 2 or 3 snacks but not increasing sugar and fat food. Include nuts to the diet, which is nutrient dense and not interfere with main meals.
