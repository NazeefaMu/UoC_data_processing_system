Deepavali Messages: ‘Fitting occasion to redouble our efforts in reconciliation’

"The Deepavali festival, being a unifying force that spreads understanding, tolerance and harmony among all peoples irrespective of ethnic, religious, caste or class differences is a fitting occasion for us to redouble our efforts to bring about greater understanding among our people, and restore peace and harmony in the country," Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Minister D.M. Swaminathan says in his Deepavali message.
"Deepavali is considered the “Festival of lights” and the Hindus believe that Deepavali dispels all the darkness in their lives and light up with prosperity.
It is celebrated by Hindus all over the world with devotion. Deepavali signifies light over darkness, good over evil and of happiness over sorrow and is an important event for the Hindus.
"In this festive season of Deepavali your aspiration should be lighting kindness and mercy, extinguishing hatred. I wish the entire Hindu community may enter the path of mutuality through the light of wisdom to gain the peaceful pleasure, in this Deepavali season."
