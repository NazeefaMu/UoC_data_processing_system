Expressions of artistic illustrations

The much awaited “expressions” art exhibition will be held once again at Lionel Wendt Art gallery on July 1 and 2 10 am to 7 pm. It will be opened on June 30 at 6 pm. Showcased at this event will be around 100 paintings by immensely talented pupils who range from age 5 upwards to adult students, of celebrated artist Dulari de Fonseka.
The exhibition of acrylic on canvas demonstrates the creative and imaginative flair of each individual artist, most of who are Gold and Silver medalists, and the drawings themselves, a medium of communicating one’s own story. It is a story that is backed by confidence in oneself, because art builds confidence. Dulari is of the firm belief that there is no proper singular method to create art, and that every artist, child or professional, feels an enduring sense of pride in their own creation; an original creation bursting with character, and made to last for generations.
Whilst being a proven method in developing essential motor skills in young children, it teaches one to be patient, be of calm mind, to concentrate, visualize and think clearly. It is therapy and it is meditation. It is utterly enjoyable, whilst communicating a serious message.
She credits her parents for identifying her inclination towards the fine arts from a young age and being the driving force behind her success as an artist. Understanding her passion for drawing, she had the opportunity of being sent to be tutored by Late Gate Mudaliyar Amarasekera, a celebrated and a distinguished artist of yesteryear. Even though he was in the twilight of his life, and Dulari herself was a small child, inspiration struck a deep chord, buoyed by the maestro’s instructions, guidance and blessings. Thereafter, she entered the reputed Vibhavi Academy of Fine Arts to follow an extensive course in theoretical and practical aspects of fine arts to further her career, and has today made a name for herself in the country as a professional artist.
“Experimenting with oil, watercolour, pastels, charcoal and pencils helps young people expose something beautiful and talented, and even after over two decades of doing what I love, the sense of satisfaction I experience in journeying with my students, is something incomparable..” says Dulari with a smile.
Dulari de Fonseka lives and paints with her family in Thalawatugoda. Her work can be found on www.dularipaintings.com.
