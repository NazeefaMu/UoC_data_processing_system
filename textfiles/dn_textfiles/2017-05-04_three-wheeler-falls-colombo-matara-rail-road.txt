Three wheeler falls on Colombo-Matara rail road

A three wheeler that fell down a precipice near Black Bridge at Piyadigama at Gintota, Galle, landed onto the Colombo-Matara rail road yesterday. The three wheeler collided with a concrete lamp post while falling on the railway.
The villagers who swiftly acted, signalled an oncoming express train and prevented a train accident.
The three-wheeler driver said as he gave way to a cab, his vehicle slipped off road and fell down the precipice.
Galle Police are investigating.
