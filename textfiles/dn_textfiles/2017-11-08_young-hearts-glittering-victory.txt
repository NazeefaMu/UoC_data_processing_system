Young hearts glittering with victory

“Establishing national reconciliation is not a duty of the government alone,” said former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga at the Award Ceremony of the All Island Essay and Art Competition recently. “The civil society should take up the leadership in accomplishing it.”
Kumaratunga, who is also the Chairperson of the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation, fostered the event which was held at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH).
The competition was held under the theme ‘Unity in Diversity is the Strength of Our Nation’ and was organized by the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) and the Bakeer Markar Center for National Unity. Minister of Education Akila Viraj Kariyawasam and Secretary to the President Austin Fernando were also present at the event.
Leaders who belonged to different races and religions held hands and fought for freedom [in the past], Kumaratunga said further. After we achieved freedom, racism and religious intolerance began for various reasons. “And no government was brave enough to address the rights of minorities,” she remarked.
But now, the background and the ‘weapons’ needed to achieve unity have been given by the government and it is the society’s turn to take the task into their hands and proceed to resolve the matter, Kumaratunga stated.
“Corrupt politicians have been spreading racism in the country. They are those who are unable to come to power in any other way,” Kumaratunga said. “Some Buddhist monks in robes spread extremism and religious intolerance, trying to set the nation on fire. But there are many other real Buddhist monks who are against it, who work hard, silently, for the peace and reconciliation of the nation. But only the extremists are being portrayed in the media.”
The young hearts were excited. Nervous. They would look at you with wide, unsmiling eyes but when they heard the words “What do you feel about your victory?” their somber faces would break into a wide smile, eyes softening as if sunshine breaking through clouds.
“I’m on top of the world!” exclaimed young Haala Marikar who had won the All Island first place in Senior English Essay competition. The student of Badiuddin Mahmud Girls’ College, Kandy had not expected the victory. “This competition has been a good venture,” she said with a beaming face. “Training young minds to think like this is something much needed in a society with a lot of racism.”
Asela Pieris of Gnanodaya Maha Vidyalaya, Kaluthara who secured All Island second place in Senior Art competition shared the same joy of Marikar. Through his piece of art, he tried to convey the message that “as a nation, we all should be united. We should shed our differences and walk into the future as children of one mother.”
The winners received a cash prize from ONUR through the Bank of Ceylon who offered additional gift items.
The All Island winners received Rs.50000/= and an Oxford dictionary whereas 1st runners up received Rs.30000/= and an Oxford dictionary. The 2nd all island runners up received Rs.20000/= and a school bag.
The provincial level winners received Rs.15000/= with a mathematical instruments box, the 1st runners up received Rs.10000/= and school books and 2nd runners up received Rs.5000/= and school books. It is reported that ONUR contributed Rs. 2,730,000/= for the prizes.
“We, as Sri Lankans, have been receding due to our division as a nation,” said Minister of Education Akila Viraj Kariyawasam. “But now we’ve found a new path to follow.”
The minister appreciated how young children, through their art and words, have been able to prove their understanding better than adults. “As politicians, government officials and citizen, we all have a duty to fulfill.”
“We are taking measures to step beyond exam-centered education and move towards a more practical system where our children learn to live practically and respect others. We are working to create a new generation with good hearts who respect basic human rights,” he said further.
The genuine innocence of the young minds could be seen through the art they had created. The wish these young people have for the future of our nation. Their colors, shapes and every pencil stroke called for peace and unity.
“We held a competition under the same theme in 2005,” said Imthiaz Bakeer Markar, President of the Bakeer Markar Center for National Unity. “But we’re still struggling. We [as a nation], still haven’t been able to give up thoughts and notions of division.”
“Diversity is a resource, a blessing and not a burden,” Markar confirmed. “Those who spread thoughts of division are like flies to the wound. We will not be able to rise as a nation if we remain this way.”
Aadhila Nasir from Hejaaz International School, 1st runner-up in English Senior essay competition, in her innocent but firm voice, said “No matter what race, religion or creed you belong to, what matters is how you are inside. Not your appearance, your faith or anything else – your character is what matters in the end. The world would be empty and dull without diversity. It is something we should embrace.”
When she said these words in her low voice, it was her heart that echoed through her lips. By teaching our young generation what is right, what is just, we can at least hope that our future will be brighter as a nation. Because that’s where the change begins. In the young heart. Within oneself. Thought by single thought. SSP
