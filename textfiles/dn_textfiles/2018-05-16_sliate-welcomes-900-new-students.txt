SLIATE welcomes 900 new students

Entrants for the academic year 2018 to the Sri Lanka Institute of Advanced Technological Education (SLIATE), Kovilkulam, Arayampathy, which comes under the Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Ministry were welcomed at a ceremony held at the auditorium of the College of Education, Thalankudha on Monday.
The institute has 1,400 students now. Although 1,800 applicants who could not gain university admission applied, only 500 full-time students and 400 part-time students were entitled for the academic year 2018, said SLIATE academic coordinator S. Jeyapalan.
He said that 900 applicants will follow the Higher National Diploma in Accountancy, English, IT and Tourism and Hospitality. Students who complete this course have great employment opportunities both locally and abroad. The course in Tourism and Hospitality is very popular and job opportunities are many.
SLIATE has plans to introduce courses like Higher National Diploma in Engineering and Higher National Diploma in Project Management.
Batticaloa Government Agent M. Uthayakumar was present as the chief guest on the occasion and was presented a memento with a golden shawl by SLIATE staff. The present followers of the courses entertained the audience with cultural items. The parents of the new recruits were also present.
