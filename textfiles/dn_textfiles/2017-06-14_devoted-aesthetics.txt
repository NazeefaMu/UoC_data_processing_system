Devoted  to aesthetics

Premier five-star urban resort Cinnamon Lakeside commemorated Poson Poya with Bakthi Gee sung by the Hotel’s associates.
About 18 associates representing different departments of the Hotel performed for their fellow team members on June 6 at the team-member cafeteria, The Link, and for guests on 7 June 7 at the lobby.
As a truly local brand, the hotel’s aim was to bring a slice of tradition and culture to guests staying at the hotel from around the world, while showcasing the talents of the associates.
