JVP, UNP, TNA playing with a stacked deck

Global and South East Region political analysts and non-interference policy scholars yesterday charged the United National Party,the Tamil National Alliance and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna as playing with a stacked deck of cards in Parliament putting people’s sovereignty at stake.
The former government led by United National Party leader Ranil Wickremesinghe has fulfilled needs of hegemonic powers rather than needs of Sri Lankan public, said the analysts. .
“The government of Wickremesinghe has seen the setting up of an Office on Missing Persons to punish soldiers, which was not one of their election pledges,” the pointed out.
“They promised the people to establish democracy, but have not held elections on time”.
“The former government was comprehensively beaten in the last local government election by a new political party, Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna which represented Joint Opposition in Parliament,” critics pointed out..
“The UNP, The JVP and the TNA did not have a program for the country at the Presidential Election of 2015, except they convened with the backing of the so called international community, to dispel Mahinda Rajaksa from Presidency,” said Foreign Affairs analist Mohan Samaranayaka.
“The hegemonic powers backed the UNP, TNA, and JVP to dislodge President Mahinda Rajpaksa because they do not like ascendance of independent governments in the Asian region. Rajapaksa turned down a request from Western powers to stop the war. They did not want Rajapaksa-China relations to blossom because of China’s increasing economic power China is fast becoming a super economic power,” he explained.
“The United National Party chose a common candidate in the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, who is the current President of the country; because it knew it could not win any elections on its own or with their leaders,” he said.
“The JVP has become vociferous of late about Parliament democracy but they did not say anything against the Speaker when he appointed the Opposition in Parliament for 16 seats of the TNA against 57 held by the Joint Opposition. Moreover, the JVP did not raise their voices when President Maithripala Sirisena who they vehemently criticize nowadays over appointing Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister, anointed Ranil Wickremesinghe who had only 41 seats in Parliament as the Prime Minister.”
Political analysts said the JVP has maintained double standards right from the beginning with regard to upholding Parliamentary traditions and maxims. They have one for Ranil and another for Mahinda Rajapaksa. The reason for this is that the JVP members get benefits from these Western powers as would do by UNP and TNA.
“A come back of a Rajapaksa regime is the last thing that these three political parties want. The UNP, the JVP and the TNA cannot afford to disappoint these Western powers. These powers are using members of Tamil National Alliance cause tensions in the country’s political map,” they said. .
They are dependent on the support of these powers to set up a federal structure of governance in the country’s North and East.
Whenever there is a problem, they go to embassies seeking their advice with concerns to how they should act. When they stay neutral the UNP and the Opposition will be at loggerheads with each other. This pattern seems to go on and on.
President Sirisena sacked Wickremesinghe and appointed Rajapaksa as Prime Minister because he had untimately to go before the people who voted him.
The President exercises powers vested in him by the people who are sovereign. The legislature, the Executive and the judiciary exercise powers inherited from that sovereignty. It is primarily exercised by the public.
“JVP ,UNP and TNA have carried out a regime change program since the defeat of the LTTE. Mahinda Rajapaksa was a target because he is an independent person, more than anything else,”he said.
