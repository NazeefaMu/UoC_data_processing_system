‘Ramazan: a time for harmony’

The month of Ramazan is thrice blessed. This month in which the Holy Quran was revealed to Prophet Sal to guide humankind to the abode of felicity, is a month of mercy, forgiveness and deliverance.
May this Eid-ul-Fitr be a means for the Muslim community to continue to live in harmony with each other as well as all other communities. Let there be peace and serenity in our motherland. President Maithripala Sirisena too, has contributed to achieve this.
I also wish that the people of Sri Lanka would be honest, sincere and united in all their dealings. This will ensure the goal envisaged by our President.
Eid Mubarak!
