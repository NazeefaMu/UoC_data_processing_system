Stray cattle in Ampara roads cause accidents

Residents in the Ampara district undergo untold hardships due to many stray cattle heads roaming along the streets.
The Pradeshiya Sabhas and Municipal Councils in the area have taken many steps to resolve the issue but all those have been proven futile.
Many vehicle accidents were reported recently in the Potuvil, Akkaraipathu, Kalmunai and Sammanthurai towns due to obstruction of roads caused by the stray cattle.
