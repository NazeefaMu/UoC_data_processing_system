Corruption case against Bogollagama fixed for trial

A corruption case filed against former Minister and Eastern Province Governor Rohitha Bogollagama, was yesterday fixed for trial on October 22 by Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake.
The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption alleged that Bogollagama, while serving as the Chairman of the Board of Investment, had illegally given his approval to release a sum of USD 3,622 as hotel accommodation cost, in lieu of an investment promotion exhibition held in London on 2006.
The Bribery Commission further alleged that Governor Bogollagama had influenced the then BOI Chairman to excessively release a sum of Rs. 376,196 for the London exhibition contrary to the Treasury’s accepted recommendations.
