Glamour  of fashion unfolds

Threads of Time, the fashion extravaganza which promises to be an explosion of couture, presented by Anita Dorai featuring the breathtaking designs of Singaporean Kavita Thulasidas of Stylemart on September 2 at the Hilton Ballroom, will be a show that takes you through a travel in time.
In Kavita’s own words Threads of Time will be, “ a magical journey of the Mystical and Mythological eras inspired by the celestial beauties of Hindu mythology , from the love stories of Laila Majnu and Jodha Akbar bringing out the essence of love in the Mogul and Rajput Era , to the nymphs and myths of the Greecian and Roman Goddesses and to the era of my favourite designer , Frenchman Paul Poiret , the period of the 1920s where Fashion was Art , reflecting modern mysticism in an extreme opulence of glitz and glamour” . As this is Kavita’s inspiration for her maiden Sri Lankan fashion show, local audiences are indeed in for a treat. An important feature of the show is that all garments will go on sale soon after the show, while it will also continue thereafter for two days at the Hilton.
Presenter Anita Dorai said that proceeds from the show will be in aid of Around the Pearl an initiative by Wheels for Wheels which aims to raise awareness of Cerebral Palsy which affects over 40,000 children in Sri Lanka today.
“ The proceeds from Threads of Time will be used to buy a special type of wheelchair which will greatly enhance the quality of life for those suffering from this dreaded disease. The target set by Wheels for Wheels initially is a 1000 of these special wheelchairs”.
On board as sponsors of this gala event are Mobil One and Porsche, while the Hilton Colombo are Hospitality Partners with Ramanie Fernando Salons coming on board as Hair and Beauty Partners. Choreography will be by Brian Kerkoven with Imran Saibo of Funtime and Anusha David of Headlines PR handling the logistics of the show.
According to Kavita, the themes and concepts of Threads of Time will be as follows ; Segment 1 the Mystical and Mythological times of the celestial beauties , Segment 2 the Grecian and Roman Goddesses of Ancient history , Segment 3 the Love stories of the Mogul and Rajput Era , Segment 4 the Roaring 20s when Fashion entered the modern Era , and Segment 5 being the Grand Finale with dazzling and extravagant garments encapsulating all four themes!
