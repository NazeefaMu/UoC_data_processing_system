Country’s debt burden has increased: Prof. Vitharana

Lanka Sama Samaja Party Leader Prof. Tissa Vitharana said yesterday the total debt burden of the country has increased to Rs 10 trillion during the last two years.
Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday, he said Sri Lanka’s debt repayment bill would also increased by two folds from Rs. 337.9 billion to Rs. 645.1 billion.
“Although Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said the debt burden would be reduced by 70 percent of the GDP by 2020 , we wonder how this can be done with such a large debt burden,” he said.
This comprised a total domestic debt stock of Rs 5,666.5 billion, a Rs. 325 billion (6.1 per cent) increase, and foreign debt, a sharper Rs 451.6 billion (11.2 per cent) to Rs 4,497.4 billion increase. “During our tenure, we managed to reduce the debt burden of GDP 104 percent to 70 percent of GDP. These figures have risen under the present government. With such a huge debt, how can the Prime Minister turn Sri Lanka into a developed country by 2025,” he asked.
He said the Government has not given priority to adopt technology to the industrial sector. It has prioritised only to develop IT. “How can Sri Lanka be an industrial hub without developing the sector,” he asked.
“During last three years, the country lost a tenfold of FDI.
The economic growth rate has also decreased to 4.3 percent while the per capita income recorded a very low.”
He said the Government promised to increase the allocation for education and health when it came into power. “But two percent of GDP for health and 4 percent of GDP for education still remain the same.
