DIPLOMATIC CORPS BOYCOTT CEREMONY?

Royal Ceylon Navy ensign fluttered bravely in Trinco on October 15, 1967 followed by Katunayake two weeks later when Royal Air Force Ensign was lowered and to the strains of ‘Namo namo maatha’ Royal Ceylon Air Force ensign was hoisted in its place.
Strengthening the bonds between the two nations, United Kingdom handed back Trinco base after 156 years of British domination. The base was handed over on October 15, 1967, exactly 50 years ago at a very impressive ceremony at Royal Navy Football grounds lowering of white ensign of British Navy and Royal Ceylon Navy Ensign with the Lion Flag at the top left hand corner being hoisted gradually to the strains of Namo Namo Maatha played by Royal Ceylon Navy Band and steady hand clapping by the large crowd present. Prime Minister SWRD Bandaranaike made a short speech.
Gaining independence from Britain in 1948, the ‘Dominion of Ceylon’ marked the beginning of self-rule. Ceylon was a superficially peaceful land when the colonial masters handed over it to the local politicians in 1948. The hastily designed United National Party was duly put in office after parliamentary elections under a British-made Constitution. A Defence treaty was signed by D S Senanayake, the first Prime Minister with Britain that gave the British a base for Royal Navy at Trincomalee, an airfield at Katunayake for Royal Air Force, with training control of the Ceylonese Army, which was manned by British military officers.
The UNP governments continued with the defense treaty with the British Administration that spared the country the cost of maintaining a large military establishment. The British Royal Air Force and Royal Navy had bases in Katunayake and Trincomalee respectively. National Defense consumed less than four percent of the state budget, compelling the governments of DS Senanayake, son Dudley and Sir John Kotalawala to encourage their continued presence in a so-called independent and sovereign state.
The SLFP, the main opposition was critical of UNP’s pro-western stand. It alleged that the Independence arranged in 1948 was a ‘mock’ and that actual freedom could only be achieved by breaking all ties with the English monarchy. The state authority, inheritors of the white masters’ customs, continued on the same lines without much disruption.
Trinco Naval Base taken over
It was a combined operation by the Royal Navy and Royal Ceylon Navy for the official handing over. Two very smart guards were presented by the two navies during ceremony. Dressed smartly was the acting British High Commissioner, Crosthwaite, who represented the UK government at the ceremony speaking said, “it was with pride with the achievements of the Royal Navy we see this base transferred today as a place in which the Royal Ceylon Navy can develop to make in its twin a fitting contribution to the security and well-being of Ceylon.”
A special train left Colombo with Parliamentarians, government officials and other dignitaries, while Prime Minister Bandaranaike flew with eight ministers. After about five months of consistent drought there was a welcome shower of rain in the early hours, however it did not rain during the ceremony.
PM in his speech said, “this marks another milestone in the long and not uninteresting history of Trincomalee relationship. It was somewhat chequered history but on the whole it can be considered a happy one. When my government took office an year ago, in pursuance of our foreign policy, we requested the British Government to handover the base to us. This step was not taken in a spirit of hostility. Our foreign policy is based on friendship with all nations and non-alignment with any of the power blocs and our request to Britain to handover the base was to give effect to this policy.”
Katunayake ceremony
Two weeks later, celebrations moved from East to West. At a simple but historic ceremony on November 1, 1957, Katunayake the last of the British bases in Ceylon, was handed over to Ceylon at the auspicious hour 9.53 a. m., another landmark in the history of the country was achieved.
The Royal Ceylon Air Force band played the first six bars of “God save the Queen” and the Royal Air Force Ensign was lowered. Then to the strains of ‘Namo namo maatha’ Royal Ceylon Air Force ensign was hoisted in its place. While this impressive ceremony was in progress inside the air base outside on Negombo road at the entrance to the base three airmen of the Royal Ceylon Air Force were busy replacing the massive ‘RAF Katunayake’ board with a new board—that of the Royal Ceylon Air Force(RCyAF).
Guards of Honour, which was presented both by the RAF and the RCyAF were first inspected by the acting High Commissioner, T L Crosthwaite and later by Prime Minister SWRD Bandaranaike. The HC speaking said, it was their hope that full advantage of this opportunity would be taken to profit by the continued example and knowledge RAF would provide.
PM in a short speech said, that with the handing over of the base at Katunayake, another landmark in the history of the country had been achieved, our independence was now complete. As you are aware, the UK throughout its connection with its dependent territories, treated their anxiety to conduct their own affairs with understanding and sympathy. When the history of this country records itself I feel certain that one of the outstanding factors will be dignity, cordiality, friendship and good grace with which the UK handed back the control of its depended territories to the people who ruled them earlier.” The Premier said the method of handing over of the two bases in Ceylon provided that things could be done in an atmosphere of dignity and friendship.
In Afghanistan
The latest of similar events in the history was recorded when, in October 2014, British troops ended their combat operations in Afghanistan as they and U.S. Marines handed over two huge adjacent bases to the Afghan military, 13 years after a U.S.-led invasion launched the long and costly war against the Taliban. At the U.S. Camp Leatherneck and Britain’s Camp Bastion, which lie next to each other in the southwestern province of Helmand, troops lowered the American and British flags for the final time and folded them away. About ten years before this an important step was taken in the relationship between Ceylon and Britain when Ceylon obtained dominion status and a position of equality among the Commonwealth nations.
However, notable absentees at the ceremony were the members of the diplomatic corps. Did they boycott? If so why?
