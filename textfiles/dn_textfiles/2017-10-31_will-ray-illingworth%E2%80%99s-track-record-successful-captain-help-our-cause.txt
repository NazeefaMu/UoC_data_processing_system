Will Ray Illingworth’s track record as a successful captain help our cause?

At present, nothing seems to go right with present cricket set up and I thought the readers might be interested in delving into the late seventies where Raymond Illingworth ruled the roost as a highly successful captain for England.
According to John Arlott’s “Book of Cricketers” Raymond Illingworth had all the ingredients of a fine captain.
Illingworth is above all, a thinking cricketer. Some have said that ‘things worked out for him’; and in terms of opportunity, he was in the right place at the right time. He himself, however worked out many things for himself, and it might well be argued that no English captain ever achieved better results in terms of relative playing strengths, states Arlott.
Illingworth the seam bowler who had the perception to switch to off spin; he had always been a utilitarian player; able to fill in where needed. So he took a hundred wickets in ten seasons; scored a thousand runs in eight; performed the double in six. In his forties he was not only fit enough to chase a ball hard, but able to take acrobatic catches. He did not rate himself highly as a batsman, but he often scored more runs under pressure than men with high reputations. As a bowler, he struggled in recent years with a shoulder injury, and often bowled in pain. Yet he retained his accuracy; exploited the turning pitch and on the plumb one set sufficient problems of length, flight - and above all the late out floater - to check and beat good batsmen.
Illingworth may not have been great in any of these departments but he must be accepted as England’s best all-rounder then since Trevor Bailey, states Arlott. Yet cricket history will probably remember him primarily as a captain. His reading of a match and general tactical acumen was appreciated while he was with Yorkshire, several of whose captains by no means least Brian Close, esteemed his advice. That was fair recommendation as a cricket brain: and, perhaps why the Yorkshire players accorded him the respectful ‘Raymond’ rather than ‘Ray’.
Ironically, the biggest upset of his career put him in a position to captain England. In 1968, with characteristic independence, though by no means out of harmony with other employees of the time, Arlott states that he asked for a long term contract with Yorkshire and when they refused, he asked to be released.The county granted his request; but in an unworthy petty gesture withheld the life insurance policy, others had been allowed to take it with them when they left. So, he joined Leicestershire for the 1969 season, and was appointed county captain. At that point Illingworth was rising 37; his Test career seemed over. He had never been an England regular (30 tests and only one tour in ten years), Arlott notes. After an indifferent series against Australia in 1961-2 he was not chosen for the subsequent tour of Pakistan. Illingworth had played with Leicestershire for only three weeks when Colin Cowdery, who had taken the successful 1967-8 side to West Indies was severely injured and had to be ruled out of consideration for the 1969 Test against West Indies. There was much shuffling of ideas and names before Illingworth on paper the least experienced captain in the country was given charge of England.
Arlott noted that Illingworth inherited a seriously depleted side by comparison with that of even a year earlier. Barrington, Dexter, Milburn, Cowdrey and Prideaux were all for various reasons unavailable; and Graveney played only more test innings, his last in that summer. On the face of it England had little chance against a West Indian side captained by Sobers. Yet they won that series and the following three test rubber with New Zealand by 2-0. Illingworth shored up a thin batting side with an average of 40.75 second only to Boycott. In the New Zealand series he was the second in the bowling with ten wickets at 15.40.
There was no dropping Illingworth after that, he was the victim of the same people hostility from the same people as had thought Len Hutton ’not officer class’ but on the surface at least, he let that worry him less than his predecessor. In four years until 1973 he took England through 9 test rubbers of which only two were lost; the first to India by a single match after rain had cost him a win at Lord’s and the overwhelming defeat by the West Indies in 1973. In that four year period, England won twelve matches, lost five and drew fourteen. They won the Ashes after twelve years by beating Australia in Australia; and retained them in England. Even in isolation that was an outstanding sustained performance.To those who observed the side objectively and realised how weak it was by comparison with its opponents - certainly including the Australians, who were not allowed to prove their superiority in results - it was amazing.
We surely need someone with a track record of Ray Illingworth’s credentials who would have ‘papered over the cracks’ but far more than wall paper was needed to hold together the crumbling façade of our team.
It’s well worth noting that Illingworth picked the best men for the job, not necessarily in terms of technical ability though he was quick to appreciate that but also for temperament and sheer application (selectors please note, as you know raw talent will not get you anywhere as we have seen since of late a flame will flicker) which could be vulnerable even to a soft breeze.
Illingworth deployed his team with such balance that it achieved maximum efficiency: and , through his own high professionalism and the trust he placed on them, he commanded from his players a degree of respect, loyalty and effort which often lifted their performance to a peak higher than the apparent sum of their talents, he was an introverted pragmatic thinker, we need many of such people who do not play to the gallery!
