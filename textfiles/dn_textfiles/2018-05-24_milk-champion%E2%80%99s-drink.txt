Milk- Champion’s drink

Children and hydration
Our bodies are made up of approximately 70 per cent water. Children are at a greater risk of dehydration than adults.
Quench your thirst
For children of all ages, water and milk are the best choices to quench their thirst. Besides having zero calories, water is a no-sugar thirst-quencher and one cup of milk has 300 milligrams of calcium, so it’s a big contributor to a child’s daily needs.
Here’s how much calcium children need each day:
toddlers (ages 1 to 3 years): 700 milligrams of calcium daily
children (ages 4 to 8 years): 1000 milligrams
older children (ages 9 to 18 years): 1,300 milligrams
The current dietary guidelines for milk or equivalent dairy products or fortified soy beverages are:
Children ages 2 to 3 should drink 2 cups (480 milliliters) every day.
Children 4 through 8 should have 2½ cups (600 milliliters) per day.
Children 9 and older should have 3 cups (720 milliliters) per day.
Milk – a sports drink? 
Athletes have good reason to focus on nutrition: replacing fluid and nutrients after an intense work out helps repair and replenish muscles and maintain strong bones. If nutrients are not replaced during and after exercise, athletes experience fatigue and may not be able to keep up the intensity of their workouts.
One beverage that is often overlooked as a recovery drink is milk. Milk’s nutrients—protein, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals and water—are rapidly absorbed and metabolized by the body to produce energy during and replenish nutrient stores after activity.
Milk is also a good source of
carbohydrates. Carbohydrates consumed within thirty minutes after exercising will be transported to muscles for immediate use or stored as glycogen for the next activity. Failing to consume adequate carbohydrates after exercising can lead to fatigue and muscle soreness.
The vitamins and minerals in milk are important for maintaining good health and optimizing athletic performance. Most dairy foods contain vitamins A and D. Vitamin A maintains healthy tissue growth while vitamin D helps the body utilize minerals such as calcium and phosphorus. The minerals found in milk—calcium, potassium and magnesium5—help maintain strong bones, proper muscle functioning and fluid balance.
Flavoured milk has become a favorite of athletes as a post-exercise rehydration beverage. While providing all of the nutritional benefits of plain milk, the additional carbohydrates from sugar in chocolate or strawberry milk are easily absorbed and metabolized.
Recent research has found that chocolate milk is not only an effective recovery aid after prolonged exercise, but that it can actually improve performance in subsequent exercise bouts.
