Lanka IOC organises Medical camps

Lanka IOC organised Medical and Eye Care Camps under its "We Care" corporate social responsibility programme for the benefit of the flood affected population.
Lanka IOC Health Camp was held at Lanka IOC petrol station at Akurassa, This retail outlet were badly damaged by the recent floods.
Engineering team of Lanka IOC restored operations of this RO within a very short time to ensure easy availability of auto fuels to local population.
To provide instant relief to local population these Medical and Eye Camps were organised on June 6 and 7, through Helpage Sri Lanka.
As people have lost their spectacles in the flood, free spectacles will also be provided to all. Though initially the camp was planned for one day only, however looking at the requirement of local population, it was extended for one more day.
More such camps are planned in flood affected areas.
