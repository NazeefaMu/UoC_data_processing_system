President to discuss new development Bill with PM

President Maithripala Sirisena has decided to have a discussion with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe regarding the Development (Special Provisions) Bill. The President disclosed this intention when a group of UNP Backbenchers in Parliament met him for a discussion recently, Parliamentarian Nalin Bandara said.
Bandara said President Sirisena said he would not have any dealings with the members of the Rajapaksa family and misuse the mandate given to him by the people.
The President also requested UNP backbenchers to keep a close observation on any UNP Parliamentarians having secret dealings with members of the Rajapaksa family.
