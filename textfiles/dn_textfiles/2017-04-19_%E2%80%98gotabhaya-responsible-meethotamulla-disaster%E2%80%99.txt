‘Gotabhaya responsible for Meethotamulla disaster’

A collective of civil organisations yesterday claimed that former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa is responsible for Meethotamulla disaster as he was the person who took a decision to dump garbage in Meetotamulla even neglecting and violating a court decision issued on banning garbage dumping at the Meetotamulla area.
The collective addressing the media said Gotabhaya Rajapaksa is now boasting that he would have solved the Meethotamulla issue during the last two-year period of the former government.
Civil Organization Collective Co-convener Chameera Perera said Gotabhaya is now saying that he couldn’t solve the Meethotamulla garbage issue as a result of political power change.
“Gotabhaya Rajapaksa took a decision to dump garbage in Meethotamulla in 2008. However, as a result of people’s agitations, garbage dumping in Methitamulla was banned by a court order in 2009. But with the powers vested with Gotabhaya, garbage dumping was carried out further neglecting and violating the court order,” he said.
According to Perera, not only the court’s decision was violated but also the people stood against it was brutally attacked by police teams lead by then DIG Anura Senanayake.
Co-convener Akalanka Hettiarachchi said a solid solution is needed for the burning issue of garbage. No temporary or half-baked solutions can solve the issue, he said. He questioned Gotabhaya whether he would have solved the garbage issue at the last two years of the former regime.
“Gotabhaya is now passing the ball to others while levelling allegations on others. As the Defence Secretary, he dreamt to create a middle-class fantasy in Colombo and the Meethotamulla Garbage dump is a result of his fantasy,” he said.
Hettiarachchi said politicians who obtained votes through the Meethotamulla garbage issue, should also be responsible for the disaster.
They are duty bound to stand for the people aiming to protect their lives.
Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya has said he couldn’t carry out the plan he implemented to solve the garbage issue as he was not given a 60 perch land by the UDA.
The UDA is also responsible for the disaster if the UDA failed to offer a 60-perch land to the Western Province Chief Minister to carry out the solution forwarded by him, Hettiarachchi said.
He said it was revealed that there was a delay in the commencement of rescue operations. According to people of the area, there were not enough vehicles for rescue operations.
“The country spends millions of public funds to import luxury vehicles to politicians, even though there were not enough vehicles to rescue the victims or save their lives” he claimed.
Convener of Power of Generation Organisation Chamara Nakandala said those politicians were not eager to solve the Meethotamulla garbage issue as they were in hurry to exploit the Central Bank or importing luxury vehicles for them.
