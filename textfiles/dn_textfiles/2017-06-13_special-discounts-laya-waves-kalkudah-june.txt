The ancient city of Polonnaruwa, along with the vibrant and iconic sights of Arugam Bay and Trincomalee, are mere hours away by road. Nestled within a pristine and virtually untouched beach setting, Laya Waves Kalkudah is the most enchanting and serene beach front property imaginable.
Offering a total of eight dwelling spaces, as well as four suites, two deluxe rooms and two standard rooms, all of which is within just four chalets, the resort has taken great pains to maintain the utmost sense of privacy and space for its guests, with a number of balconies and terraces offering gorgeous views of Kalkudah's azure sea.

Inspired by the Sanskrit word LAYA, which evocatively suggests REPOSE, that aura of tranquility is what the World of LAYA offers, as it welcomes all travelers to its chain of hotels. Founded by the Sri Lanka Army to initially cater to the welfare of its war heroes, with the introduction of the LAYA concept, its Welfare Directorate thought it fit and proper to throw open its doors to local and international visitors. The LAYA group comprises LAYA Safari in Yala, LAYA Beach in Wadduwa, LAYA Leisure in Kukuleganga, and LAYA Waves in Kalkudah - all oases of absolute serenity.
