SLASSCOM partners JISA

The Sri Lanka Association of Software and Service Companies (SLASSCOM) signed an MoU with the Japan Information Technology Service Industry Association (JISA) at the World Trade Centre yesterday.
SLASSCOM CEO, Mano Sekaram said this is an historic occasion for Sri Lanka's ICT sector whose software now powers even global high-end solutions, including Microsoft's Live Search Engine.
Sekaram said the ICT sector growth is continuous, even the workforce which is expected to be 200,000 strong by 2022.
Sri Lanka is emerging to be a top outsourcing destination for ICT related businesses and a knowledge centre. Last year Lankan exports from IT related exports hit $790 m and the latest projections are the country will achieve $1Billion this year itself-a year ahead of what was previously predicted.
"We work on JISA Spirit, meaning ICT is the base industry for all other industries. Our MoU with Sri Lanka's ICT and BPO sector in which we share industry information is not only a new opening for Sri Lanka but for us at JISA too," JISA Vice President Kazunori Hamano said . "The first MoU is also about technology and technical aspects."
JISA has similar MoUs with Taiwan, China, Bahrain and Korea and this is a first for us in South Asia -and therefore this is important for us too. JISA has 593 Japanese members including information processing and database VAN service suppliers and leading software developers under it. JISA is multinational and we support the globalisation of IT industry. Today 8% of global ICT market belongs to Japan. Close to half of the Japanese software business belongs to Customised Software followed by software product development and other businesses such as internet based.
Japan is considered as Asia's high-tech powerhouse. The 2014 estimate for global production by Japanese electronics and IT companies was $362 Bn.
