People can now enjoy freedom: PM

The Rajapaksa regime was responsible for tarnishing the country’s international image rather than safeguarding it in the past. Consequent to the defeat of the Rajapaksa regime on January 8, 2015, people received the opportunity to enjoy peace and freedom. But unfortunately, certain sections of the media have failed to understand that freedom and use it properly, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister made this observation, addressing a meeting of the Kolonnawa UNP Bala Mandalaya, held at Kolonnawa on November 26.
The Prime Minister said that following the January 8 victory, a good governance government was formed under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena. Subsequently, they won the Parliamentary election too. During the last two years, the government had ushered in development throughout the country. The previous government had left over an immense debt burden on the country, he said.
The government thought that it should save the country from this debt trap without allowing the future generation to inherit it, he added.
The Premier said after resolving the fundamental debt problem by 2020, it hoped to create a sound economy which could service the debts by 2050. The government had not stopped the development work by taking refuge in the country’s debt problem. If the government was able to resolve the debt problem, Sri Lankans could regain their honour and prestige once again, the Prime Minister said.
“The government was trying its best to improve the education system through the ‘Nearest school, best school,’ programme. It was also developing the road network in the country to facilitate investment and easier travel.
“The Sedawatte road would also be developed under this programme. The government had already offered housing loans to build nearly 3,000 houses in the area. The government had taken steps to solve the garbage mountain and flood problems in the area by providing enormous relief to the people. Funds had been allocated to develop the villages and create employment avenues for youths. The fact that there is democracy in the country had been accepted by the world. The government was involved in creating a country where people of all communities could live in peace and harmony by upholding Buddhism and giving due place to other religions,” the Prime Minister said. He said the government is now involved in finding solutions to conflict situations in the country.
Law and order was maintained properly. Giant development schemes had been launched throughout the country. The area from Kandy to Hambantota will have a special development scheme. The Kurunegala area was also being developed. Colombo and Gampaha would be developed as megapolis cities. Industrial zones were being launched in the Kalutara district, Galle and the surrounding regions would be developed as a tourism zone. More factories and hotels would be set up next year. The computer technology industry would also be developed. All this was being done to find jobs and empower youth, the Prime Minister said.
