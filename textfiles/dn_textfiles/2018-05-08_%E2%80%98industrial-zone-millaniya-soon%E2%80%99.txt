‘Industrial zone in Millaniya soon’

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said coordination between the divisional secretariats (pradeshiya lekam karyala) is necessary to launch the development programmes introduced by the government.
The government has already had talks with a Thai investor to establish an industrial zone in Millaniya in the Kalutara District on 450 acres of land, with 100 industrial establishments providing employment to 5,000. Construction will begin in July when the government signs the final agreement with the Thai investor. The Premier was addressing the ceremonial opening of the new Millaniya Divisional Secretariat building, which cost Rs. 5 million, recently.
He further stated if the divisional secretariat is involved in a tug-of-war with the government over development programmes, it would create an unhealthy situation where development would be stalled.
The Premier said Minister Vajira Abeywardena had launched a programme costing millions of rupees to construct new buildings with auditoriums for the divisional secretariats in the country as most of these offices were dilapidated. The previous government had neglected the services provided by the divisional secretariats.
