Ko and Park fight for top spot

United States, Thursday: New Zealand teen star Lydia Ko and South Korea’s seven-time major winner Park In-Bee will fight for the LPGA’s top prizes this week at the season-ending Tour Championship.
Lydia Ko of New Zealand putts during the final round of the Evian Championship Golf on September 13, 2015 in Evian-les-Bains, France. 
While 18-year-old Ko, who won her first major title at this year’s Evian Championship among her five tour triumphs this season, has the edge on Park in the chase for world number one, LPGA Player of the Year, the season money crown and the season points title.
Park, 30, won the Women’s British Open and her third consecutive Women’s PGA Championship among her five LPGA titles this season and leads in the Vare Trophy scoring average contest.
But the margins are slim enough to take the drama for each of those honors into the year’s final round.
“I’m going to just try and concentrate on my game and I think that’s what Inbee is going to do,” Ko said. “I’ve just got to concentrate on my game.
“I know there are obviously a lot of things on the line at the end of Sunday, but if I end up thinking about all the things like Player of the Year or Vare Trophy or the race or the tournament, I think it’s way too much because when we’re out there we’re just trying to hit good shots, trying to make a lot of good putts and give ourselves good looks for birdies.”
Ko won last year’s $1 million (939,000 euros) bonus for the season points title and captured the Tour Championship for another $500,000 for the richest payday in women’s golf history. But Park comes in off her 17th career LPGA victory at the Lorena Ochoa Invitational in Mexico and has given herself a chance to finish the season atop the rankings. A victory would ensure that but she could finish as low as 12th this weekend and still pass Ko.
“It feels good to actually have a chance,” Park said. “I thought I may not have a chance at Player of the Year coming into last week, but after winning, that definitely gave me a good chance to look at it this week.
“It’s good that I actually got an opportunity. I should be very thankful for that. It was already a great season with the two major wins.”
- Scary similarities for Ko, Park -Park said the most dangerous thing about a showdown with Ko is how similar the Kiwi prodigy’s style is to her own game.
“She’s a very good putter and so am I,” Park said. “I think we’re good short game players and not long hitters, but we can hit it straight, and we’re mentally very similar, staying calm on the golf course.
