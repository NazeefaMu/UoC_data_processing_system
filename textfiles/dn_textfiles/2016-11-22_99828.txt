Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake heads Kandy Cricket Club

Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake was elected the new president of one of the oldest cricket playing clubs in the country Kandy Cricket Club at their AGM held in Kandy on Sunday. The club has been in doldrums for the last decade and everyone is hopeful that the sports loving minister would bring it back to the years it enjoyed in the past.
Ekanayake is the seventh and current Chief Minister of the Central Province of Sri Lanka. He previously served as the second and fourth Chief Minister of Central Province. At one time he was president of the Sri Lanka Basketball Federation and saw to its growth. It is for sure that all the shortcomings will be looked into by the new committee which has a good set of cricket lovers.
In the Kandy district there are nearly 14 schools involved in cricket and they produce good cricketers, some of them can be roped in and also the club is in need of a sponsor.
Cricket has been played in the Kandy district since around 1863. It was mainly played by Kandy Sports Club. This club was doing well and in the 1970’s the club failed to play a match on the due date and they were suspended from cricket. Then some keen cricket promoters who were with the club like Mervyn Berenger and Bertie Gomes changed the name to Kandy Cricket Club and continued the game.
