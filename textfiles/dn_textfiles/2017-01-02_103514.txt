Around 9,757 families live in slums in the Anuradhapura district and 9,120 without proper roofing, protection and sanitation. About 10,556 do not own land and 10,578 families have no funds to build a house even though they own land. A survey conducted recently by the National Housing Development Authority (NHDA), Anuradhapura revealed.
About 27,401 houses are half completed and 95,182 houses have no plastering and proper roofing, the survey shows.
According to the Anuradhapura NHDA District Manager R.M. Piyatissa, Rs. 750 million was allocated to implement a housing programme in 2016 and 6,000 new houses are nearing completion. Piyatissa said 23 village projects are coming up in the district for 600 houses. A special housing project proposed for the benefit of kidney patients will comprise 250 houses under its first phase.
We are making arrangements to put up a apartment project of 250 units for middle income group for the first time in Anuradhapura. One housing unit costs Rs. 3.7 to 4.7 million. This project will expand to other metropolitan areas as well, he said.
