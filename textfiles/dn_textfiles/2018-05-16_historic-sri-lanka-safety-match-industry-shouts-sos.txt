Historic Sri Lanka safety-match industry shouts SOS


A historic Sri Lankan industry spanning 100 year period and producing an essential item in the day-to-day lives of households, is bracing for the sudden dousing of their fires due to supply side pressure. A high level policy directive is now awaited after the intervention of the Industry Minister.   

A group of safety-match producing industry representatives led by Chairman of Sri Lanka Safety Match Makers Association (SLSMMA-and Chairman of Sun Match Co Ltd), B.D.R. Rajan informed the Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen about a crisis they are faced with on 8 May in Colombo.  
 “Our entire annual production of more than 12 billion safety matches is sold-out in local market with no exports due to their essential nature in day-to-day lives. However the production will stop at the end of this month and no alternatives in the market” said Rajan.  
“The problem is due to delay in receiving vital chemical imports-potassium chloride and red phosphorus- for our safety match production. We are producers and cannot directly import the chemicals since the manufacturers are not allowed to import directly. Two bidders/importers in Sri Lanka have been importing them from India and China and delivering to us. In recent times these essential chemicals are not imported and distributed to us on time.”  
“Certain delays in the tender system and the new testing requirement where testing by Industrial Technology Institute of Sri Lanka has resulted in total stoppage of regular chemical supplies to us. As a result all the 11 Lankan safety-match making companies are at a stage where they cannot run production anymore -and by the end of this month we are compelled to shut down. 
We call upon the Industry Minister Bathiudeen to intervene and relax the new chemical regulations and red tape so that our production can re-start without delay.”   
Minister Bathiudeen responded that safety match industry is an important sector in Lanka. “It is one of the first Small and Medium Industries to commence here” he said. He promptly contacted the relevant Ministries and requested clarifications and having received, instructed his top officials to immediately communicate the required changes –to change regulations – so that imports resume and the production could recommence.   
A highly placed official from Defence Ministry said: “We understand that there is a slowdown and are working on this. We too visited their factories after Minister Bathiudeen’s intervention. We are now awaiting for a directive from HE President’s office on this, expected this week.”
