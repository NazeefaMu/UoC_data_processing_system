NWP PHIs to launch strike

The North Western Province (NWP) PHIs said they would keep away from official duties at the Munneswaram annual festival and the Thalawila Church feast if their grievances regarding their services were not addressed by the NWP health authorities immediately.
Sri Lanka PHIs’ Association President Upul Rohana was speaking at a meeting of the PHIs Association at the Chilaw Town Hall recently.
“The PHIs, who were on duty at the State Vesak Festival Week at Bingiriya Raja Maha Viharaya, Kurunegala, too had not been paid their allowances.
“Therefore, we have decided to launch trade union action soon because the NWP health authorities have ignored our demands,” he said.
