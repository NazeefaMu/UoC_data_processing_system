CEB asked to submit 12 expansion plans

Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), the electricity sector regulator, asked the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) to develop12 new scenarios which will provide different power plant combinations to generate electricity for next 20 years and submit the plans on or before July 7.
PUCSL said these scenarios should be developed with updated prices for coal, natural gas and oil and with the cost of externalities (social and environmental costs) and should be submitted together with input data.
“We carried out an in-depth study on the proposed Least Cost Long-Term Generation Expansion Plan 2018-2037 prepared by CEB and analysed the comments and proposals that key stakeholders made during our public consultation process,” Damitha Kumarasinghe, Director General of PUCL said.
“Taking all that into the accounts, PUCSL requested 12 new scenarios to be submitted apart from the plant combination recommended in the plan, so that the nation can be ensured that every option is studied and best 20-year power plant plan is given approval.”
PUCSL instructed CEB to use the electricity demand forecast on the recommended power plant combination (Base case) in the proposed Least Cost Long-Term Generation Expansion Plan (LCLTGEP) 2018-2037 to develop these new scenarios and to do away with the assumption that pump storage plants are mandatory.
The LCLTGEP has been compiled based on the results of the latest electricity expansion planning studies conducted by the CEB for the planning period of 2018-2037.
