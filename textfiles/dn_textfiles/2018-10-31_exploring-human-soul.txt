Exploring  the human soul

Soulscapes by Dillai Joseph, an art exhibition that explores the human soul in its barest form was held recently at Lionel Wendt Art Gallery.
Dillai Joseph is a self-taught artist who later honed her skills under the tutelage of Nadine David. The latter was a student of David Paynter. The innermost desires, awakened feelings, beastly hungers and dormant daydreams find their place on canvas in her portrayal of the 'I' within every woman. Her work speaks of an aim to provoke a sense of exploration of oneself; she looks at the deep nature of the woman within, beyond a body of just flesh and skin.
