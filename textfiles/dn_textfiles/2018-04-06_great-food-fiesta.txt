Great food fiesta

Graze Kitchen turned into a hawker street recently with lots of colour, design and flavour when a team of energetic chefs cooked up a storm to dish out an interesting and vibrant piece of work. Featuring more than 75 authentic street food, this offering aims to bring the world’s great food capitals under one roof.
The buffet featured an extensive spread, liquids included, offering ample varieties such as Dips and Dippers from the Bangkok night market – Som Tam (Thai papaya salad), glass noodle with seafood, Vietnamese rice paper rolls filled with fresh vegetables and chicken.
From local scene, Galle Face Achcharus like pineapple, lovi, apple and other food items like kottu and hoppers were available. `Sri Lanka meets Italian corner’ offered roast paan paninis while `A night in Osaka’ offered Sushi sandwich. With street specials from Istanbul, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam the Hawkers Market was an event not to be missed. You could even pick up a sizzler from the Moghul section or check out the super sweet selection at Bombay Bazzar which made the event an amazing gastronomical experience.
