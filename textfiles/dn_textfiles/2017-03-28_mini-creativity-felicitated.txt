Mini creativity felicitated

The Whyteleafe Performing Arts Academy recently held its annual Excellence Awards at the Sambuddhathva Jayanthi Mandiraya Auditorium in Colombo with the objective of recognising and developing the creative aspects of its students. Giving their thoughts at the event, many distinguished guests commended this program given that it recognises a wide variety of children’s talents that are not usually recognised in Sri Lankan schools.
Under this program, the children had the opportunity to participate in several novel competitions that haven’t been seen before in Sri Lanka. This includes the ‘Best Critic Award’, which was introduced by Whyteleafe Academy tree years back, where the students displayed a splendid ability to provide creative critical reviews of artistic creations such as songs, novels, drama and movies. The ‘Best Young Entrepreneur’ competition was also held this time to a high standard. It evaluated students on a variety of criteria like planning, production, promotion, marketing, business report writing and presentation.
The Whyteleafe Academy, which was founded by award winning dramatist Nalaka Swarnathilake, introduced ‘Student Personality Award’ which was devised as a way to recognize and reward personality development where they were able to balance and excel in the fields of education, sports and aesthetics.
In addition, 21 awards were also presented covering a wide range of areas such as announcing, public speaking, dancing, singing, debating, acting and script writing. Students from over 30 schools in Colombo, Gampaha and Kalutara who are a part of the Whyteleafe Academy took part in the competitions.
The Best Student was awarded to Pankaja Kulathunga, a Grade 11 student of Ananda Vidyalaya, based on his participation and excellence across several contests at Whyteleafe, his personality and behaviour qualities displayed at the Academy.
The award show also recognised veteran journalist Hema Nalin Karunarathna and artist Susantha Nanayakkara with the Whyteleafe Appreciation Award for their contribution to Sri Lankan arts and media.
The Whyteleafe Achievement Award was presented to Rashenka De Silva for her outstanding achievement in academic and displaying exceptional talents in sports, drama, dancing and other extra-curricular activities. She was a cast member of Nalaka Swarnathilake’s Dangamalla tele drama (2006).
The keynote speech was delivered by Senior Lecturer Attanayaka M. Herath. Many distinguished guests graced this occasion including Minister of Mega polis and Western Development Patali Champika Ranawaka, Prof. Kusuma Karunaratne, Sanath Gunathilaka, Buddhada Galappaththi, Hema Nalin Karunarathna, Chaminda Gunarathna, P.A.K.D.
