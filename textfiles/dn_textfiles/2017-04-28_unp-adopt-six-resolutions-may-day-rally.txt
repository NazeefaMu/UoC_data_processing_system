UNP to adopt six resolutions at May Day rally

Six resolutions are to be adopted at the UNP May Day rally for the welfare of the working community, Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya Vice President and Media Spokesman Sunil de Silva said.
Addressing a press conference at Sirikotha yesterday, he said a large number of Trade Unions including the Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya would take part in the UNP May Day rally at Campbell Park in Borella.
“A parade has been organised from Maradana to Borella and about 100 decorated vehicles will be used in it. Females and youth will join the parade in two separate groups. The UNP May Day rally will attract large crowds from around the country,” he said.
While pointing out that all their demands made at last year’s May Day rally have been met, including that of increasing public servants’ salary by Rs.10,000, he asked what demands could be gained by staging strikes . “Those TU actions ended with nothing. Those were just politically motivated agitations,”he said.
