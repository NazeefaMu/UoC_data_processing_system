Get rid of former Health Minister, GMOA urges

A total of 14,000 MBBS doctors (90 percent of doctors in the public service) have signed a petition against the former Health Minister and expressed their objection towards re-appointing him even as a Cabinet Minister, the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) Media Spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda said.
He was addressing the media in Colombo yesterday.
He said the rest of the doctors are now allowed to place their signature in this petition via internet because they serve in distant and difficult areas in the country and are unable to travel to Colombo due to their official duties.
“There are about 20,000 members in the GMOA which is in existence since 1926. The petition will be handed over to the President and the Prime Minister soon,” he said. According to Dr. Ananda, the former Health Minister had launched a plan to join the new government and grab the Health Ministry again.
“The new government should get rid of all henchmen who are officials of the former Health Minister to implement new policies. Otherwise they will sabotage the work,” he said.
“The officials of the former Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama such as Chandani Wijewardana, K. G. Weerasinghe, Mangala Yapa, Desha De Mel and New Zealand citizen Ravi Ratnayake etc should be removed with immediate effect to implement the new government's projects without hindrance,” he added.
