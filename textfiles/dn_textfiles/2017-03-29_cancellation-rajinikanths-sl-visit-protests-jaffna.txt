Cancellation of Rajinikanth's SL visit : Protests in Jaffna

Hundreds of people, on Monday, rallied in Sri Lanka’s Jaffna to protest against Tamil Nadu politicians under whose pressure Rajinikanth cancelled his visit to the country.
He was scheduled to hand over houses to displaced ethnic Tamils.
Protestors belonging to different parties, including the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), gathered near Jaffna’s iconic Nallur Kovil, raising slogans against politicians in Tamil Nadu.
The 66-year-old actor was scheduled to hand over houses built by Lyca Group’s Gnanam Foundation for displaced Tamils in the decade-old separatist war in northern Jaffna.
He had cancelled the visit following mounting opposition from Tamil Nadu politicians.
Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) and Tamizhaga Vazhvurimai Katchi (TVK) had urged the actor to not go ahead with his two-day visit.
The actor had said he took the decision after founders of Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK) and VCK, Vaiko and Thol Thirumavalavan respectively, and TVK leader T. Velmurugan asked him to consider withdrawing from the event.
However, senior TNA leader Suresh Premachandran said Mr. Rajinikanth’s visit was a corporate advertising effort to use the Lankan Tamil issue.
Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa’s son Namal, an opposition legislator, had slammed Tamil Nadu politicians for forcing the actor to cancel his visit.
