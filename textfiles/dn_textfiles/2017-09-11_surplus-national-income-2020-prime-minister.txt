Surplus in national income by 2020: Prime Minister

“The Government could reduce the deficit of national income over expenditure down to 0.2 percent in 2016 from 1.5 percent in 2014 and by 2020, we hope to ensure an income surplus,” Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Galle.
The Prime Minister was speaking at a function held in the Samanala Grounds in Galle on Saturday to grant compensations to flood affected tea smallholders and factory owners in Galle.
He said the Government could reduce the gap in deficit because of the farsighted policies aimed at vibrant economy launched by the Unity Government of Good Governance of President Maithripala Sirisena.
“Between 2005 and 2014, the country’s foreign borrowings at commercial rate increased by 233 percent. We had to spend 89 percent of the Gross National Income (GNI). By 2016. We needed Rs. 14,740 billion to settle external loans and our GNI was Rs. 113,700. We even had to increase the taxes to increase the government income. Following judicious initiatives taken by the Unity Government, we could reduce the deficit, he said.
“Today we could assist our tea smallholders and factory owners as we could initiate many new fiscal policies in the economy. We are not truly satisfied with our achievements. We have gained victories in economy. As a government, we have to serve the country and its people. We have rectified issues relating to balance payments. We have to increase our national income further and have to encourage and draw foreign investments for the purpose. We are also resolved to boost local or foreign ventures to lift our GNP. We inspire overseas investors by introducing relaxed taxation system and have formulated attractive tax concessions to our local financiers. The Inland Revenue Act will address many tax obstacles faced by investors. By the end of the year, the country will witness progress and benefits of our new policies,” the Prime Minister said.
He said the GSP Plus was regained and new trade accords with India and Singapore were reached. “We have introduced a new Foreign Exchange Act gaining foreign assets to the country. New employment opportunities in large numbers will be provided with the new foreign investments. A new development strategy will come into effect. Starting from Kandy to Wellawaya, a host of novel development projects will be propelled,” the Premier said.
He said new industrial zones would be established with the opening of the Kandy Expressway and Kandy would emerged as highly developed metropolitan.
“We have special plans to introduce new tourism zones throughout the country with special emphasis over Kalpitiya. Under the Kalutara Industrial Zone, a large industry was already established. We are acquiring suitable lands for the proposed tourism zone in Galle. A distinctive tourism plan is underway to attract high income tourists to Elpitiya, Dedduwa, Balapitiya, Akurala and Koggala aimed at improving income of people in the area. The tourism will be extended up to Matara,” the Prime Minister said.
“Massive industrial expansion will be in Hamabantota and Wellawaya. The Hambantota Port will be developed by a Chinese-Sri Lanka Joint Venture. The Mattala Airport will be improved as a useful national asset. An oil refinery, power station and a cement industry will be established in those areas. A new tea factory will be set up at Charlymount in Weligama,” he said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said the Government would usher a massive prosperity to the south and expand the development to Wellawaya.
“We brought all these triumphs because we could form a national unity government under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena. All parties including the UNP, SLFP, Muslim Congress, upcountry Tamils parties, and Jathika Hela Urumaya were united to form the Good Governance Government to resolve several national issues of the country. We are not prepared to hand over grave national problems of today to the next generation. We do not want to continue the coalition administration for ever. Once we solved the grave national issues of the day, we would start work as separate political entities,” he said.
The Prime Minister said the recent floods heavily affected tea smallholders and Ratnapura, Baddegama, Akuressa, Deniyaya, Kalawaana, Rakwana, Agalwatte, Bulathsinhala and Hiniduama were most devastated.
“We will assist the tea smallholders in all their adversities. We will improve the industry. We have granted compensations to over 5,600 tea smallholders and 17 tea factories in Galle. We are firmly resolved to fortify the industry and the cultivation. We will assist tea smallholders further,” the Prime Minister said.
Ministers Vajira Abeywardana, Gayantha Karunathilake and Chandima Weerakkodi, Southern Province Governor Hemakumara Nanayakkara, Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal De Silva spoke. Deputy Minister Manusha Nanayakkara, Galle District Parliamentarians Wijepala Hettiarachchi and Bandula Lal Bandarigoda were present.
