India turns down Sivajilingam

A request for visa made by TNA Northern Provincial Councillor M.K. Sivajilingam to attend a week-long workshop in India had been rejected by the Indian High Commission, it is learnt.
A group of over 10 Provincial Council members will represent Sri Lanka at this workshop for Tamil local government members, to be held in Hyderabad.
The other participants excluding Sivajilingam have already left for India to attend the event.
According to Sivajilingam, his visa application has been rejected by the Indian High Commission due to his involvement in several protest campaigns in India.
