World's most expensive burger

The humble burger, crafted and cooked to a high standard, can be a thing of beauty. But can a pimped-up patty ever justify a price of £1,785 (one thousand, seven hundred and eight five pounds)?
That's exactly how much the world's most expensive burger - approved by Guinness World Records - will cost you.
The sumptuous sandwich consists of a Japanese dry-aged Wagyu and Black Angus beef patty, Oosterschelde lobster infused with Hermit - Dutch Coastal Gin, foie gras, white truffle, Remeker cheese, Japanese fruit tomatoes and caviar.
French lettuce, Iberian ham, and a specially-concocted sauce made with 35 lobsters, Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee, Madagascan vanilla, saffron and Japanese soy is also added to the mix. And it's all stuffed in a brioche bun made with saffron and covered in gold leaf.
The decadent burger was created by chef Diego Buik, of the South of Houston restaurant, in The Hague, Netherlands. A Netherlands native, Diego developed a passion for hamburgers during his two-year stint working at SoHo House, London, reports Luxurylaunches.com. Shortly after returning to Rotterdam, he started designing and building his own burgers, and in 2015 he won the prize for the city's best patty and bun creation.But he was just warming up.
To mark International Burger Day on May 28, he set out to create the world's most expensive burger - and did just that. Speaking to Vice.com , Diego admitted it isn't even the best burger he's tasted.
He said: "Byron in London served me the best burger I've ever had - a beef burger on a brioche bun with dried bacon, Byron sauce, tomato, red onion, and aged cheddar. It cost me about £14."
