Ladies’ - Musaeus regatta on October 6


The much-awaited annual Ladies’ College-Musaeus College regatta will take place on October 6 at the Colombo Rowing Club. This beautiful setting with open grounds and calm waters of the Beira Lake comes alive with the sensation of excitement and much hope on this important day in the calendars of both schools. This event has continued to foster a special bond of comradeship between them in the spirit of good competition and a shared passion for the sport. Rowing is a competitive sport involving much skill, teamwork, strength and endurance. This is clearly seen in the dedication and determination of both crews, who have been training with added commitment and fervour in the weeks leading up to the encounter. The crews have been trained under the able guidance of coach Sharen Kannangara and assistant coach Saliya Gunasekara for Ladies’ College and coach Anuradha Nadaraja for Musaeus College. This year, Ladies’ is captained by Sanjula Boteju and Ashvini Subasinghe with Kavisha Dassanayake as vice captain. Musaeus is captained by Mayanthi Weerakoon and her vice-captain Binali de Alwis.
