Mediation Board gets first woman chairperson

The Sri Lanka Mediation Board Commission has appointed Balkis Abdul Majeed, a retired teacher, to the post of Nintavur Mediation Board Chairman.
This is the first time in history that a woman is appointed to this post in Sri Lanka. Balkis Abdul Majeed who served as a Mathematics teacher for 39 years in several parts of Sri Lanka, joined the Mediation Board service in 2010.
Another 17 members were appointed through an interview held by the Justice Ministry, followed by a training programme.
