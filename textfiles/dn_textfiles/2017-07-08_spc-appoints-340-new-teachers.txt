SPC appoints 340 new teachers

The Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council (SPC) recruited 340 graduates and diploma holders to the Provincial Teachers’ Service recently to end the teacher shortage in the province.
The newly-recruited received their appointment letters at the Provincial Library Auditorium from Sabaragamuwa Chief Minister Mahipala Herath.
They were selected from 4,000 applicants through interviews. The teachers will be attached to difficult and most difficult schools, SPC sources said.
The teachers have to provide their service to the school they are appointed at for five years. “The Council has recruited 1,800 degree and diploma holders in 2017. More will be recruited to end the teacher shortage, especially Tamil medium teachers,” Chief Minister Mahipala Herath said.
