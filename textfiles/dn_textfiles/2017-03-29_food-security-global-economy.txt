Food security in a global economy

In April 2010 an Icelandic volcano that goes under the name of Eyfajallajokull erupted and wrought havoc in the airline industry. Hundreds of flights operated to and from Europe were cancelled or diverted elsewhere as flying was deemed too dangerous due to the thick smoke emitted by the volcano.
One effect of the cancellation of this air travel was the disruption caused by the eruption to global air cargo and particularly to the exports and imports of food products. Many African countries such as Kenya, Uganda and Zambia were badly affected, being unable to air freight their exports of vegetables to their primary markets in Western Europe. Britain and other developed nations also experienced shortages of fresh food while Persian Gulf nations who relied entirely on imports saw their stocks of food rapidly depleting.
This volcanic eruption provided an insight into the real risks faced by humanity if at any stage food security was compromised.
Surrender through starvation
The traditional view of what constitutes “Security” has always been dominated by military and strategic considerations. In fact, since the earliest of times, food has been considered a strategic factor which can determine the outcome of a conflict.
While it did not go under the name of “food security” in earlier times, siege warfare which was practiced all over the world and throughout history, was a way of preventing the other side from getting access to vital provisions, of which food played the most important part. The objective of this tactic was to force surrender by subjecting the opposing side to starvation.
In two world wars, Germany tried and failed to bring Great Britain to her knees by blockading the UK with an almost successful submarine warfare campaign. Had Britain surrendered due to the loss of food security and been reduced to starvation, the course of world history would have been any different.
Revolutions in Russia and China
What is therefore clear is that any country, even a world power, will need to achieve and sustain a certain quantum of food security to ensure that it has the capability of operating independently on the world arena. Food security is a very good measure of economic strength and political capabilities.
Economists and historians have long understood that there is a strong nexus that exists between food insecurity and political and social upheavals. Good examples of these including the many wars and revolutions that have taken place all around the world. Failure to ensure food security was a determining factor that led to revolutions in Russia in 1917 and China in 1949.
Around the early 1990’s in the wake of the disintegration of the former Soviet Union, a new area of study called “Soft Security” was formulated which covered strategic concerns in areas such as information, knowledge and food security. The security rating of a country had moved away from a measure of how many tanks, bombers or missiles that a country could deploy, to one where economic considerations had become the main measure of power. In this light, food security had emerged as a major factor in assessing a country’s strategic power.
However, it can be argued that in today context, food insecurity represents a lesser threat than at any previous time in history. The “Expo Milano 2015” which was held in that Italian city for six months, focused heavily on food security. Its central theme was “feeding the planet”.
Sri Lanka did participate at “Expo Milan” hosting a pavilion where leading State agencies held exhibitions to promote the country in the areas of trade, tourism and investment.
The importance of food security was highlighted and given much prominence by the Italian Government. In 2015 the United Nations General Assembly also identified food security as one of its key development goals.
The other development goals of the UN being for humanity to achieve at a global level universal primary education, gender equality, reduce child mortality, improve material health, combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases, to ensure environmental sustainability and to develop global partnerships for development.
Climate changes and economic forces
New global considerations have arisen and the agenda on food security now covers such issues as the “Right to Food and proper nutrition”. In the context of globalization this will impact considerably on relations between states, since countries which have food security will be now compelled to help those that have not achieved that capacity.
Some of the mitigating factors that have positively impacted on food security are the many advances achieved in biotechnology which have given humanity the capacity to overcome challenges such as national limitation, climate changes and economic forces.
Some of the advances in biotechnology include the possibility of selecting and eradicating diseases affecting plants and protecting seeds with biological agents.
It is therefore gratifying to note that today most of the planet is fed and it can be said that food security has been achieved globally to a large extent.
Currently the FAO estimates that 842 million people in the world are underfed (12% of the global population). While this means that still 3.1 million children die as a result of malnutrition, and 300 million continue to go to bed hungry each night, the problem of food security has been largely addressed.
Food security is also a complex issue since even the most developed states have pockets of malnutrition. US authorities reported in 2012 that 85% of the American population was food secure, which would mean that the remaining 15% of Americans experience some form of hunger on a daily basis.
The Milan Charter was formulated and based on issues also discussed in the Expo Milano 2015. It placed considerable emphasis on bringing together the world’s citizens to re-examine issue relating to food consumption and food security.
The Milan Charter also called on the international community to address these problems and also to measure progress in improving the global food system.
The problem of food security today is not just about feeding the 800 million hungry people, but also to prevent future conflicts that may be caused by deprivation in food and nutrition.
Also experts need to make the “Right to Food” a universal value because currently many countries are not signatories to any treaty protecting that right.
To conclude it can be said that food Security is now an integral part of the agenda to achieve globalization and efforts should be made to tap the goodwill that exists to address whatever shortcoming that may exist in this area.
