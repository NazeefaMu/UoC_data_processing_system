Democracy in jeopardy today - Gammanpila

Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader MP Udaya Gammanpila yesterday said that today a question has arisen what democracy really is?
Gammanpila was speaking to the media following the announcement of the Supreme Court decision on the dissolution of Parliament.
“The UNP first postponed the Local Authority election and then they postponed the Provincial Council Election and today they have postponed the parliament elections until 2020 courtesy of the Court decision.
So today a question has arisen on what democracy really is? Members of some western missions in Colombo worked without sleep to realise the above.
According to them democracy means, not having elections, curtailing sovereign rights of the people,” he said.
