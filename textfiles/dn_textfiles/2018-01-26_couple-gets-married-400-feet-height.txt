Couple gets  married  at 400 feet height

People say that getting married is an extremely stressful thing. But this adventurous couple from California took it to the next level by saying their “I do’s” 400 feet above the ground.
Ryan Jenks and Kimberly Weglin tied the knot above the desert near Moab, Utah, where they both fell in love and later got engaged.
“It only made sense to them to get married here too,” wrote the photographers on their Instagram.
“It is a representation of confidence, self-love, and life; the energy I want to surround myself with and carry with me into our marriage and throughout our lives together,” Weglin said in an Instagram post.
