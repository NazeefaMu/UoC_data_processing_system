North should not act as independent state: MR

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, addressing the media after paying his final respects to former Parliamentarian V. K. Indika at his house in Punchihenayagama, Ambalantota, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had recently requested him to speak on the allegations made against him by the New York Times.
He said the Prime Minister had pledged to produce Arjun Mahendran at Parliament, but it had not been done thus far, adding that therefore, he would not make a statement until Prime Minister Wickremesinghe held true to his promise.Commenting on the LTTE commemoration in the North, Rajapaksa said that it was as if the North was a separate state on its own and as such, citizens could carry out any act they wished.
The commemoration itself was not an issue for the present regime, he said, adding that if a similar event were to occur in the South, however, those persons would be brought to book immediately.
