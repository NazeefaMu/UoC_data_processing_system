Gallant Afghans give England a fright

 
DELHI: The lack of inexperience showed in the Afghanistan line up as they threw away a golden opportunity of beating a full-fledged ICC member team when they went down to England by 15 runs in a ICC World T20 Group 2 match played at the Feroz Shah Kotla grounds here on Wednesday.
Afghanistan had England down on their knees at the end of the 18th over at 107-7 but the final two overs they leaked a massive 35 runs to give their opponents some breathing space. England who won the toss and batted first eventually reached a respectable 142-7 courtesy an unbroken stand of 57 off 5.3 overs between Moeen Ali and David Willey for the eighth wicket.
Moeen slammed four fours and a six for his unbeaten 41 off 33 balls and Willey’s 20 not out off 17 balls comprised two sixes.
That total was enough for the England bowlers to defend as both Willey and Chris Jordan made early inroads into the Afghan batting by reducing them to 13-3 by the third over –a position from which they failed to recover from and were restricted to 127-9 thanks to some lusty hitting by tailender Shafiqullah who finished on 35 not out off 20 balls (2 sixes, 4 fours).
Following their magnificent win against South Africa where they chased down 231 runs, England did not do themselves any justice when they put up a spineless display of batting on a pitch that had pace and bounce on it which the Afghan spinners exploited to the full. Skipper Mohammad Nabi, Samiullah Shinwari and Rashid Khan had the England batting in a muddle as they tossed the ball up without any fear and found appreciable turn and bounce. England were also responsible for playing too many loose shots that cost them their wickets.
Their best batsman Joe Root was run out for 12 when Ben Stokes didn’t respond to a call and Root trudged back to the dugout livid with rage. The England batting was a comedy of errors and they had to thank Moeen and Willey for preventing them from total disgrace.
Not surprisingly Moeen Ali was named man of the match.
This was the first World T20 match of the current tournament hosted at this troubled venue which during the match it was announced that the Delhi Municipility has given the Delhi District Cricket Association all the rights to host the remaining World T20 matches including the semi-final.
England’s next game is against Sri Lanka at the same venue on Saturday.
