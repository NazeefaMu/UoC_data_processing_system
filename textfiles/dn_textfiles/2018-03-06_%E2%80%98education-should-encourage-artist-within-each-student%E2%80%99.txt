‘Education should encourage the artist within each student’

The National Literary Festival 2017 - 2018 was held under the patronage of Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development and Cultural Affairs Minister S. B. Nawinne at the BMICH yesterday.
I. Alwis was awarded the first place for his work under the ‘Children’s stories above 18 years’ category.

N.S. Withanachci was awarded first place for poetic composition, while V. Shakthivel was placed first for research study on folklore and D.L.D.D. Rasanjana was placed first for academic articles on Sinhala encyclopedia/dictionary.
Addressing at the event, Head of the Normadic School, Dr Sunil Ranasinghe said that it was the responsibility of artists and writers to create an environment to prevent nuclear war and environmental pollution that could obliterate human life from earth.
He also pointed out that naturally, both a hunter and a looter live in each human being, which they inherited 200,000 years ago. “So corruption and fraud is in our DNA,” Dr Ranasinghe said.
“But we can control it with the art and literature because there is also an artist in each human being inherited by way of DNA.”
He also pointed out that the education should be moulded so as to not destroy the artist in each person.
Cultural Affairs Director Anusha Gokula Fernando delivered the welcome speech.
