NARA to investigate complaints

The National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA) has been asked to investigate whether the hot water pumped out of the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant and into the sea is affecting marine life in the area. Environmental groups and the fisher community have complained to the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Ministry about the damage caused by the hot water from Norochcholai and asked that NARA investigate into it.
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera chaired a special meeting on the subject with ministry officials, NARA, Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and the North Western Provincial Council Fisheries Ministry to discuss the issue.As a result, NARA has started investigations into whether the hot water from Norochcholai was affecting the fisheries, aquatic plants and sea bed around Norochcholai coal power plant.
The minister has asked that the investigation be continued and for the North Western Provincial Ministry, North Western Environment Unit and the CEB to assist the study.
NARA has also been asked to study whether the dust from the coal power plant was affecting the fisher community in the area and to come up with recommendations on how the impact could be minimized and alternatives found to help the people.
The minister has asked that they come up with ways in which they could also cool the water and then release it to the ocean instead of directly releasing hot water.
