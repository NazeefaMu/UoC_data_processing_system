Unemployed youths find self employments with coconut shells

Coconut shell collection has now become a self-employment for the jobless youth in the Hambantota district. They convert coconut shells into activated carbon and earn an additional income. Others sell them to the large-scale coconut shell traders in Colombo. They said nearly 60,000 coconut shells are needed to produce a metric tonne of activated carbon.
