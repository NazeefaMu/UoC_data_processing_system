Drought affects 300,000 people

The Disaster Management Centre (DMC) yesterday said that nearly 300,000 people from 92,000 families remained affected by the drought in six districts.
The DMC identified Puttalam, Kurunegala, Kandy, Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Mannar as the districts affected by the drought.
According to the DMC, 66,436 families in Puttalam, 17,194 families in Kurunegala, 3,189 in Anuradhapura, 4789 in Mannar, 250 in Polonnaruwa and 159 from Kandy are affected.
Meanwhile, the water levels in the hydro-power reservoirs in the upcountry have gone down significantly as there have been no adequate rains in catchment areas.
Water levels in key hydro-power reservoirs such as Laxapana, Rantambe, Victoria, Randenigala, Bowatenne and Moragahakanda have decreased sharply, authorities said.
