Drug trafficker’s sons remanded for his murder

Bandaragma Police arrested the two sons of a drug trafficker in Athurugiriya, Depanama, Pannipitiya, for the alleged murder of their father on July 1.
The body of the deceased, Jayathungerge Manoj Prasanna (52) had been dumped in the Rambukkana Canal. The deceased had served an eight-year sentence for murder and had been released recently. He had then been trafficking heroin in Depanama.
He was known to harass his wife and two sons. His body was found wrapped in a bag in the Rambukkana Canal by Bandaragama Police. Panadura Additional Magistrate Kalhari Liyanage held the magisterial inquiry into the death and ordered the Horana AJMO to perform the autopsy. After the postmortem, the body was handed over to the two sons. The body was subsequently buried in a cemetery in Athurugiriya.
However, Bandaragama Police received information that the two sons of the deceased were responsible for the murder of their father.
On interrogation, the suspects admitted that they were responsible for committing the murder of their father because he was consequently harassing their mother. The two suspects were produced before the Panadura Additional Magistrate and they were remanded for two weeks pending further investigations.
