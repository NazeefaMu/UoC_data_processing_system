The Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), having considered the critical financial conditions of ETI Finance Limited (ETIFL) and the possible implications to the financial system, decided to permit and facilitate ETIFL to sell its holding of shares in subsidiary and sub-subsidiary companies and investment properties, based on a proposal submitted by the Board of Directors of ETIFL, for a net amount of USD 75 million subject to compliance with the applicable laws and regulations.
This was stated by Central Bank further to the Press Release dated 02.01.2018 relating to ETI Finance Limited (ETIFL) and Swarnamahal Financial Services PLC (SFSP).
Out of USD 75 million, the buyer has transferred USD 32 million and ETIFL has received its Sri Lankan Rupee value of Rs. 5,017.6 million. Having considered the request of the depositors, ETIFL has been instructed to pay urgently, 10 percent of deposit liabilities which amount to approximately Rs. 3,350 million and the accrued interests of Rs. 1,400 million (approximately) as at end May 2018 using the sales proceeds received.
The payment will commence on 05.06.2018. Also, ETIFL has been instructed to pay a further 10 percent of deposit liabilities on receipt of the balance part of the sale proceeds (USD 43 million).
