Ampara farmers to complete paddy sowing by May 5

The Agriculture and Irrigation Departments officials request Ampara district farmers to complete their paddy sowing operation for the Yala 2017 season before May 5.
Farmers now engaged in sowing in all DS divisions in the district. Most paddy farmers in the Ampara district use certified seed for paddy cultivation. They obtain seed paddy from their seed paddy processing centres in the Ampara District.
In the Ampara district, about 45,940 acres of paddy lands will be cultivated during Yala 2017 season, Ampara District Secretary Thusitha P Vanigasingha said. In addition, 10,822 acres of sugarcane cultivation will be undertaken by the farmers in the district.
The cultivation for Yala season will take place as follows:
Ampara area: 14,833 acres, Akkaraipattu area: 10,080 acres, Sammanturai area: 4,008 acres, Ampara Right Bank channel: 2,360 acres and Akkaraipattu, Sammanthurai and Kalmunai River Irrigation: 14,659 acres, have been allowed for Yala cultivation.
Due to the drought that prevailed during the Yala 2017 season, limited paddy lands were cultivated. Farmers have been informed of this fact at the cultivation meeting. During the Yala 2017 season, only 42 percent of certain areas in every division of the district were identified for sowing during the current Yala season.
The meeting, in this regard, was held at the Akkaraipattu Divisional Secretariat, recently. This meeting was presided by Residential Project Manager M.M. Naleem. The Ampara District Agricultural Instructors of the Agricultural Department, Irrigation Department officials, farmer organization officials and farmers participated.
