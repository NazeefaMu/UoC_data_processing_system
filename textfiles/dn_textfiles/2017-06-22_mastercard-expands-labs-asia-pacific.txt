Mastercard expands labs in Asia Pacific

More than five years since first launching in Singapore, Mastercard Labs has reaffirmed its commitment to being pioneers of a World Beyond Cash by opening a new Innovation Showcase, housed at its new Asia Pacific headquarters.
The space will be a new home base for Mastercard to continue developing innovative digital commerce solutions that simplify and safeguard how we pay for things across banks, merchants, businesses, governments, and consumers around the world.
Located in Singapore’s DUO Towers, theMastercard Innovation Showcase will host numerous fintech innovations developed by various Mastercard Labs around the world, including many that were built in Singapore and will be one of several Innovation Showcases located in major global cities, including Sydney, Dubai, New York, St. Louis and London.
Tobias Puehse, Vice President, Innovation Management, Digital Payments and Labs, Asia Pacific, Mastercard said, “Today, our Innovation Showcase has already become a central hub in advancing technologies such as chatbots and biometric authentication, while also inspiringup and coming developers and students to shape the future of commerce. As a leader in digital payments,we seek to drive meaningful innovation that positively impacts all Fintech stakeholders and builds a world beyond cash.”
The interactive innovations on display feature a range of digital payments technologies from robotics and artificial Intelligence, unattended retail, and contactless payments technology to wearables, biometrics authentications and solutions that further drive the brand’s commitment to financial inclusion.
These include a payment solution for the humanoid robot Pepper, which is scheduled to be rolled out later this year; Interactive chatbots; and the Qkr! with Masterpass vending machines which allow consumers to purchase items via a mobile application.
In addition to featuring key payment innovations, the Mastercard Innovation Showcase also provides a platform to drive regional fintech growth through collaborative dialogue, connecting key stakeholders and shaping young talent, such as developer and API networking events, fintech community events and start-up bootcamps, university dialogue sessions as well as lab crawls.
Since 2012, Mastercard Labs in Singapore has served as a launch pad for numerous digital innovations and products that have travelled beyond Singapore to be applied successfully in other markets both across Asia Pacific and globally.
Examples of made-in-Singapore innovations include the conceptualisation and execution of a digital paymentplatformwithin humanoid robot, Pepper, extending the robot’s ability to integrate customer service, information and sales into a seamless and consistent user experience.
