Health Ministry to accelerate activities in 2017

More power will be given to the people in 2017 but power of an individual will not be increased, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Senaratne, arrangements will be made to accelerate the activities of the Health Ministry in 2017 and the current tender procedure will be changed to enable decisions to be implemented within a few days. “If a decision is taken today, it can be implemented by tomorrow,” he said addressing the ceremony at the Health Ministry to commence work for 2017.
The minister pointed out that the government is aiming at winning the development goals through sustainable development and priority will be given for the development of health and education.
President Sirisena is taking steps to abolish his own position. The six committees appointed in connection with the new Constitution will present their reports to Parliament, he said.
Legal action will be taken against all culprits who engaged in corruption, malpractices and murders during the previous regime. Year 2017 will be a victorious year for the country and the people, he added.
