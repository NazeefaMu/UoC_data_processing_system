Army ‘A’ and Air Force ‘A’ to battle for supremacy in women's T20

The two Women’s ‘A’ teams of Air Force SC and Army SC deservedly qualified to play in the finals of 2016 Women’s D1 T20 Tournament when they sent Navy SC (A) and Colts CC out of reckoning in the two semifinals concluded on Friday at Colts ground.
Both finalists are now geared up to win the championship at any cost after a glorious run in the first round winning all their matches quite confidently. In two semifinals, Army bowlers, Niluka Karunarathna and Nilakshika Silva propelled their side to a 32-run win over Colts CC well defending their below-par total of 117 whilst Chamari Atapattu’s well-accomplished 77 not out fashioned Air Force’s 7-wicket win against Navy (A).
After completion of the first round of this competition, the top two teams of each group on points, Group A – Army (A) & Navy (A) and Group B – Air Force (A) & Colts CC became four semifinalists. According to the individual performances of the first round, Prasadini Weerakkody of Navy SC topped the batting list with 127 runs at a remarkable average of 127 as she got out only once in the three innings she played with Yasoda Mendis of Air Force (102 runs at 102), Shermin Shaila of Colts (94 at 47), Nipuni Hansika of Army (90 at 45) and Imalka Mendis of Army (84 at 28) occupying the next four positions of the batting list.
Janakanthi Mala of Colts leading the bowling list with 10 wickets to her credit recorded the tournament’s best match analysis of 6/16 against Army (B). Oshadi Ranasinghe of Air Force, Sharina Ravikumar of Army and Inoka Ranaweera of Navy all bagging 7 wickets each occupied the next three positions of the bowling list.
