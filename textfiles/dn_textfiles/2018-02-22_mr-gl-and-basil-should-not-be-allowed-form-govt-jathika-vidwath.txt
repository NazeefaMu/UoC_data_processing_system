MR, GL and Basil should not be allowed to form a Govt.- Jathika Vidwath Sansadaya

The Jathika Vidwath Sansadaya on Tuesday assured that they will never allow former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, G.L. Peiris and Basil Rajapaksa to form a government.
Addressing the media yesterday at National Library and Documentation Services Board, Vice President of Jathika Vidwath Sansadaya Ven.Malabe Seelarathana Thera said that all measures will be taken to strengthen the Good Governance Government formed by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
“We will never let the gang of thieves of Mahinda who entered Parliament on the National List to realise their attempt of toppling the government,” Jathika Vidwath Sansadaya National Organizer Ven Ambanwala Gnanaloka Thera said.
Ven.Bopitiye Dhammissara Thera said the Local Government Election results reflect the people’s verdict over the government’s failure to take decisive action against those accused of fraud and corruption.
Jathika Vidwath Sansadaya Chairman Priyashantha Gunawardane said that a gang of refugees who didn’t make any contribution to the forming of the Unity Government are attempting to remove the Prime Minister from his post by holding media conferences.
“We will never allow them to fulfill their wishes,” Gunawardane said.
He further said that the government could not be toppled on the outcome of a Local Government election result. “People cast their votes to elect members to develop their villages and not to topple the government,” Gunawardane added.
