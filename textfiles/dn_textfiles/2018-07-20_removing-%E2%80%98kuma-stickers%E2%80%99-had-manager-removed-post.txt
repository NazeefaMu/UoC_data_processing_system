Removing ‘Kuma Stickers’ had manager removed from post

Sri Lankan Airlines Network Planning and Research Manager Priyadarshanai Epitawela said she had been removed from her post as Advertising Manager for not choosing ‘Kuma Stickers’ to put up an advertising hoarding.
Epitawela said she had chosen another company over ‘Kuma Stickers’ for the contract of providing SriLankan with an advertising hoarding at Kandana for a cheaper rate to another company.
This was disclosed before the Presidential Commission investigating alleged fraud, corruption and misappropriation of state funds and property in SriLankan Airlines, SriLankan Catering Services and Mihin Lanka during its sittings yesterday.
Epitawela cross examined by Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Pathirana said her department head at the time, Ranjith Silva, had questioned her decision and the CEO Kapila Chandrasena had opposed her decision to handover the advertising hoarding contract at Kandana to a company named ‘Opal’.
