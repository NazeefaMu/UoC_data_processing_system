A letter to smart children

My dear child,
We celebrated the Children’s Day recently. And we spoke much about child rights and privileges. Well, I know very well that hardly interests you. Wait, I am not writing to lecture you on such things.
When I see you, dear child, glued to the smartphone, I cannot but reflect how advanced and smart you are – definitely more than our own times. You have proven your mettle as a multi-task performer with the latest digital devices. You are faster with your work. Your fingers run on a screen like a marching, leaving no room for mistakes. Unlike us, your generation is blessed with the “touch” which helps them to retrieve any information on any topic within a second or so whereas we spent much time looking for books and reading them.
The best friend of many young children now seems to be the smartphone, which has become an integral part of your lives.
Your active and inquisitive nature, particularly with such devices in the present context calls for special attention as a simple touch with their soft fingertips, can take them to infinite locations with images and actions of any kind.
It seems that many children have distanced from their parents, brothers and sisters under the same roof and embraced smartphones as their sole companion with whom they share conversations, smiles, laughter, worries, problems etc. while being deaf, dumb, and blind to the nearest ones at home. Moreover, the habits we had during our childhood like playing with friends out in the fields, hide and seek, helping with parents with their gardening and domestic work, having a swim in the village river or a stream etc.
are becoming a thing in the past as they have been replaced by video games and social media on small screen. Qualities like respecting parents, teachers, elders, compassion, honesty, faithfulness, empathy etc. seem to be disappearing from the world of the present generation. One reason for this is they can’t see properly as their eyes are glued to the screen most of the time and the other reason is they can’t hear properly as their ears are connected to earphones. It’s quite true that we have to keep pace with the changing world and make proper adjustments. I’m reminded of what the Buddha opted for Enlightenment. He selected the Middle Path – in the simplest sense, maintaining a balance without going to extremes. Therefore your generation must think more of what you do with the ‘screens’ and if you do it with the sole intention of getting the advantages of it for your future prospects, while maintaining a balance paying an equal attention to values, customs and traditions of our culture, our sons and daughters, you will be going along the correct path which as adults, we too can follow you with a sense of pride and happiness.
