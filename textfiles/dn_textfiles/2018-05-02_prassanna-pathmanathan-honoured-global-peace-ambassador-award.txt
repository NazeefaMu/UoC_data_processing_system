Prassanna Pathmanathan honoured with  Global Peace Ambassador award

The Sustainable Development Accelerator and the 2nd Global Business Leadership Forum 2018 recently took place at the ITC Grand Central in Mumbai, India on April 7, 2018.
The event was heralded as a Global Leadership forum and the largest business award platform which recognizes and felicitates businesses and business leaders, entrepreneurs, start-ups, peace activists and other such individuals who have showcased a level of change through their avenue of work.
Organized in conjunction with the Unified Brainz of India, the World Peace & Diplomacy Organization and in association with The Hindu Business Line, the event gathered recipients from across the globe and included professional, models, actors and directors to name a few, from more than 15 countries.
One of these countries included Sri Lanka, where a number of Sri Lankan recipients were emphasized for their contribution in their respected careers. Amongst them was Prassanna Pathmanathan, who was awarded the Global Peace Ambassador Award at the event. He was recognized for his contribution to humanitarian and voluntary services through the many motivational and career guidance seminars that he conducts around Sri Lanka with the title “Make it Happen.”
The aim of an awarding platform of this caliber allows for national recognition to be commended for the achievements and contributions from individuals across diverse business, entrepreneurial and creative disciplines.
Such a platform also serves as an example and an incentive for youth in countries like Sri Lanka to channel their energies towards the right direction and prompt them to create a positive change in their community and beyond.
Pathmanathan’s recent win shone light on his impressive abilities and credentials that has elevated his professional approach to the work he does. Well-known amongst the corporate fraternity as an international corporate trainer, creative entrepreneur, a consultant in the fields of marketing, public relations and fashion, a motivational speaker, lecturer and personal coach, Pathmanathan is also trilingual.
He has been instrumental in conducting engaging training programs for over 110 companies and has trained participants from more than 75 countries to date; ranging from countries such as the United Kingdom, Australia, Egypt, India, Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines. His practical approach to training programs, etiquette programs and grooming sessions are well recognized among professionals in the corporate world.
When asked about his inspiration behind the launch of the ‘Make it Happen’ programs, Pathmanathan added, “I launched ‘Make It Happen’ for the very reason of giving back to society and to use my skills to help people, schools, universities, youth and women in rural villages, motivate the down-trodden and uplift them towards achieving an avenue of sustenance. Whilst I train many corporate clients for a fee, I felt the need to reach out to those who were in dire need of motivation but could not afford it due to poverty. This thought prompted me to reach out to those who no doubt need such a form of elevation and offer the best of myself, on an en gratis basis.”
Pathmanathan’s reason for initiating the ‘Make it Happen’ program was not aimed towards garnering recognition and all who associated with him encouraged him to raise its purpose to the public in order to request for more support from those who wish to contribute towards his worthy cause.
“This could be steered in the form of a national initiative, to give people a better life. Further, I wish to drive this endeavour through social media to urge generous donors to consider the plight of those who yearn for a brighter future,” he added.
At the Global Business Leadership Forum 2018, Pathmanathan was also invited to deliver a talk on “Humanitarian Action and Pursuit of Peace” and joined a renowned panel of distinguished business leaders, social activists and corporate big-wigs who also contributed as part of the event’s proceedings.
The event presented Excellence Awards which covered a number of significant categories such as World Peace Ambassador and Messenger Title Awards to name a few. These were bestowed onto social activists from around the world and those who have initiated and carried on the agenda of global peace in their respective countries and fields.
The Chief Guest at the awards ceremony was the First Lady of Maharashtra, Amruta Fadnavis. Fadnavis was also invited to unveil a book titled “World Peace & Diplomacy, The Concept Unfolded” authored by Prof. Dr. GD Singh, Founder & President of WPDO, witnessed by eminent guests and diplomats where a large contingent were present from Sri Lanka, which also happened to be the partner country. The event also saw Amruta Fadnavis being bestowed and honoured with the title of the ‘WPDO World Peace Ambassador’.
