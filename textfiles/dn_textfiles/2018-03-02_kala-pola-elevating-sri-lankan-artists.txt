Kala Pola; elevating Sri Lankan artists

Kala Pola was inspired by world famous out-door art fairs like the Montmartre in Paris and the Turl Street Art Festival in Oxford. Within just a couple of years, it was being regarded as an important art event and a highlight on the Sri Lankan art calendar.
The John Keells Group began its association as the sponsor and organizer of Kala Pola in 1994 and has done so every year since with the guidance of The George Keyt Foundation.
Each year the fair has grown to include more artists, attract more visitors and occupy more space on Ananda Coomaraswamy Mawatha. The fact that the street that hosts it has now turned into a permanent art market all year round is the greatest testament to the impact Kala Pola has had.
The 25th edition of Kala Pola was held recently with the participation of High Commissioner of India to Sri Lanka, Taranjit Singh Sandhu as the Chief Guest. Over 300 local painters and sculptors participated at this year's event which featured portrait sketching, cultural entertainment and a kid's art corner.
