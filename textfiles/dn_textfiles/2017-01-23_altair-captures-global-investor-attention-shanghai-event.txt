Considered one of the best showcases in the global properties sphere, the LPS invites the cream of high net worth investors, property funds and Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) looking for attractive investments around the world.
“The recently proposed investment incentives linked to Residency Visas generated a significant level of new interest in Sri Lanka as a location for investment,” Altair Director Pradeep Moraes said.
“This was the second occasion that we participated in a forum of this nature in China, and the results were quite encouraging.” Altair’s Head of Sales & Marketing Jay Dias also addressed an Investor Forum that was part of the LPS programme.
Now constructing its 42nd storey, Altair, designed by the global architectural celebrity Moshe Safdie, will on completion comprise of a distinguishing 63-storey ‘leaning’ tower and a taller 68-storey vertical tower.
It will have 400 luxury apartments that offer spectacular views of the Beira Lake, the Indian Ocean and the city of Colombo.
