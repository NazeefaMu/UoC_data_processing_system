UNP MP challenges JO: get MR to vote against Ravi

Puttalam district Parliamentarian Ashoka Priyantha yesterday challenged the Joint Opposition to bring former President, Kurunegala district Parliamentarian Mahinda Rajapaksa to Parliament to vote for the no confidence motion against Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
He was addressing the media at the Government Information Department yesterday.
“After 10 to 15 years, we now have a separate Finance Minister in Parliament. Because of this, the Joint Opposition was able to bring a No Confidence Motion against the minister. During the previous regime, the Finance Ministry was under the President,” Priyantha said. Badulla district MP Chaminda Wijesiri said the Joint Opposition
was trying to mislead their supporters by doing useless things without even one fourth of representation in Parliament.
Kalutara District MP Lakshman Wijemanne said for the first time in history, a defeated President was attempting to destroy the government to get back his lost privileges. bHe said the Rajapaksa regime was the worst regime that Sri Lanka ever had. “By bringing a No Confidence Motion against the Finance Minister, the Joint Opposition is helping us to strengthen the people’s confidence in our government,” Wijemanne added.
