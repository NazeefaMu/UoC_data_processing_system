Weerawansa’s remarks were a tirade against democracy: Wijenaike

National Organizer of the National Freedom Front (NFF), Piyasiri Wijenaike yesterday, denounced the comments made by his own Party leader Wimal Weerawansa MP that a bomb attack should be launched on Parliament.
Addressing a media briefing in Yakkala, former Minister Wijenaike said that he had confronted the NFF Secretary and sought answers to the comments made by Weerawanse.
“As the National Organizer of the NFF, I questioned the Party Secretary as to why our leader had made such a comment when the Party’s Central Committee had taken no such decision. The comments made by Weerawansa were wrong. I can assure you that the comments made by him were not the Party’s view. Maybe they were his personal views,” Wijenaike said.
The NFF National Organizer went on to say that Weerawansa’s remarks were a tirade against democracy.
“I think stating that a bomb attack should be launched on the Parliament of a peaceful country is also an attack against democracy. As the National Organizer of the NFF, I say that this comment is wrong, even if it was made by our own party leader. I can assure you that this is not the Party’s stance.”
Wijenaike also said that as the National Organizer of the NFF, he would wish to apologize to the entire Parliament for the derogatory comments made by one of his party members.
Wijenaike further noted that the comments made by his party leader could be detrimental to the country which was now marching on the path towards peace after defeating the scourge of terrorism which plagued the country for nearly three decades.
Weerawansa's comments have garnered severe criticism from many quarters during the last few days.
Meanwhile, the Speaker has informed that as soon as Parliament meets again, MP Weerawansa's threat would be brought to the Parliament's attention and further action would be taken.
