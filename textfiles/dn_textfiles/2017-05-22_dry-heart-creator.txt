Dry heart of the creator

Paris was never really Camus’s cup of tea, and certainly not when, newly arrived there in the spring of 1940, he was living in a drab hotel room in Montmartre and doing humdrum secretarial work at the newspaper Paris-Soir. But in his spare time, he was frantically busy. On completing a full draft of L’Étranger at the end of April, he sat down in the middle of the night and wrote to his future wife Francine Faure back in Algeria.
He confessed to her that the intensity that came with writing was the only thing that can get me beyond myself and I believe that I will forgive everything in Paris for having allowed me to live locked up like this in what I was doing. Even if it didn’t have value, the joy of the work itself has a value that no one can destroy and it is that joy I would feel tonight if I weren’t so tired. I still imagine that the reader of this manuscript will be at least as fatigued as I am and I don’t know if the continuous tension felt within it will not discourage many souls. But that isn’t the question. I wanted this tension and I worked to transmit it. I know it is there.
Just how many souls the book may have discouraged is hard to tell. What is certain is that it gripped the imagination of influential figures such as André Malraux, whose strong recommendation paved the way for publication. “Watch out: this will be an important writer”, he predicted to Gaston Gallimard. As for the German censors, they judged the work to be apolitical. But even with these doors opening, Camus could never have envisaged the extent of the novel’s future success. With more than 10 million copies sold in France alone and translations into sixty languages, it has become an icon of twentieth-century world literature. Alice Kaplan tells the life story of L’Étranger (The Outsider in Britain, The Stranger in the United States) with verve and insight.
The vogue for the American novel in France in the 1930s helps explain why Hemingway is frequently cited as an influence on Camus. Kaplan focuses more tightly, however, on James M. Cain’s The Postman Always Rings Twice and draws some striking parallels. And yet the origins of L’Étranger were intensely local. As Kaplan explains, Camus’s work as a reporter working for Alger-Républicain meant that he was covering court cases that reflected the tensions and violence that were part and parcel of colonial Algeria. In the edgy Algiers life of the period, pimping, street violence and machismo were all part of the mix. Kaplan reports specifically on a case of racial segregation on Zéralda beach outside Algiers in the summer of 1942 and the killings of Arabs that followed.
If such a climate of violence finds its way into L’Étranger, so too does the posturing of courtroom officials that had caught the eye of a young journalist on the lookout for copy. Kaplan cites the example of a French judge, Louis Vaillant, who, dealing with a Muslim defendant accused by the colonial authorities of murdering a conservative Islamic leader (this was the El Okbi trial of June 1939), produced a crucifix to let the defendant see what the guiding principle of the judge’s life was. In the novel, Camus would assign the cross-wielding role to Meursault’s examining magistrate.
Again, in the letter to Francine, Camus wrote of being desperate to stay in what he called “the atmosphere of the book”. The grating tones of cultural and ethnic assertion are central to that atmosphere. Kaplan reminds us of the contrasting readings of the novel, of how publicists in post-war America, for example, lumped its young author and Sartre together as exponents of a new European trend called Existentialism and of how Edward Said, writing almost half a century later, would insist that behind what he called Camus’s “portentous metaphysics” lay the novel’s nameless Arabs. Kaplan also draws in Kamel Daoud’s Meursault contre-enquête (2013), a rewrite of L’Étranger which tells how the family of Meursault’s unnamed Algerian victim not only have names but also live lives blighted for decades by frustration and resentment. As Daoud explains to Kaplan, L’Étranger means different things for American, French and Algerian readers.
But another key to the atmosphere of L’Étranger is its style. Recalling the novel’s “distant and empty narrator”, Kaplan asks: “How can such a disturbing book elicit so much loyalty?” If the tone was what intrigued so many readers, Kaplan draws out powerfully how Camus was discovering his craft: “To write”, he mused, “one must fall slightly short of the expression rather than beyond it. No chit chat”. “Pas de bavardages en tout cas”, reads the original diary entry of August 1938. After the wordy expositions that had gone into his failed novel “La Mort heureuse”, Camus was fashioning a narrative voice that was disarmingly pithy. He reflected in his notebooks on “the dry heart of the creator”.
Kaplan vividly recreates the atmosphere surrounding the book’s material production in wartime France: the miles clocked up by the manuscript as it crossed back and forth between Occupied and Free zones; Malraux’s speculative query to Camus, now back in Algeria, about the cost per ton of shipping paper over to France should it be needed at the printer’s; and the lack of red tape – the book went to press on April 1, 1942, and a month later Camus had yet to see it or even a contract for it. But of course finding a big Paris publisher was the prize for someone more used to tiny print runs in Algiers.
As Kaplan observes, L’Étranger was an odd work for someone building a reputation as a humanist. While the novel evokes the disturbing life of a social marginal, Camus’s work as a journalist drew him increasingly into the public arena. In the summer of 1939 he had campaigned in Alger-Républicain against the conditions of desperate poverty then affecting the population of Kabylia and he was outspoken about colonial rule. In August 1944 around the time of the liberation of Paris, he was writing editorials for the newspaper Combat.
Yet a decade later, the reality of life for Camus was one of growing social and political isolation. After his bitter falling out with Sartre in 1952 over L’Homme révolté – his controversial essay had presented National Socialism and Communism jointly as examples of state terror – Algeria’s slide into all-out war in the mid- to late 50s was another cause for despair. As someone viscerally tied to French Algeria, Camus now felt increasingly disabled as a writer. He was drying up. Yet in public he could still make the business of writing sound easy. In an interview in 1959, the year before his death in a car accident, he reflected back on the technique he had used in L’Étranger: “once I discovered the trick, all I had to do was write”.
