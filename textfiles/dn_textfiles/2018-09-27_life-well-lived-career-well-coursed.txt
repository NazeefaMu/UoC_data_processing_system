It was not of men who excelled like in the exceptional calibre of Dr Chris Uragoda that Alexander Pope who wrote: One science shall one genius fit; so vast is art so narrow is human wit .It is a lamentable fact that as Henry Taylor said ( Artvelde , Part 1 , Act 1 Sc. 5). The world knows nothing of its greatest men which impelled us to write on Dr Chris Uragoda the onerous task, as he is an intensely a ‘private ‘ person who made no public pronouncements and did not and do not wish to be in the limelight.
