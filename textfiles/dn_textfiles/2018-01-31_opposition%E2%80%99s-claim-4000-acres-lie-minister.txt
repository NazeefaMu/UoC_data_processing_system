Technological City in Homagama
Opposition’s claim of 4,000 acres a lie - Minister

The Opposition claim that 4,000 acres of land has been acquired by the government for the proposed technological city in Homgama is a downright lie aimed to drive fear into the minds of people and mislead them, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
He said there are no plans whatsoever to acquire land belonging to the people in the area for the proposed development project.
Addressing a janahamuwa at Weralupagoda, Homagama, Minister Ranawaka said the 92-acre Mahalenwatta has been acquired to build a technological city. It will have a nano technology institute, a green university and NDT Faculty. Further, the Universities of Colombo, Sri Jayewardenapura and Moratuwa will each have a faculty here.
He said this government has not acquired any land belonging to the people. Steps were underway to make compensation payment to owners of lands acquired by the previsions regime. He said an access road had to be built to Mahena Estate from Hoamagama. Building of this road would commence this year.
Minister Ranawaka said that the university would brighten the region and boost economic activity. When students came to live here, there would be a big demand for food, lodging and other services.
The people residing in surrounding areas would be able to earn an extra income.
The Minister said in addition to these lands, 800 arces had been acquired from Millewa estate. Four other large estates to be taken over had been identified and discussion were on with their owners to buy 246 acres to facilitate extension to the technological city. He had also advised divisional secretaries to contact him whenever problems relating to land had arisen.
He cautioned people not to be deceived by false propaganda spread by opponents. The government on its part would never oppress the innocent masses. Everything regarding the proposed technological city would be done in consultation with the people in the area.
