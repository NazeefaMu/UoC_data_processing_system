Allianz to acquire Janashakthi General Insurance

Allianz, the global financial services leader, announced that it has entered into an agreement with Janashakthi Insurance PLC to acquire 100% of its subsidiary Janashakthi General Insurance Limited for Rs 16.4 billion.
The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to complete in the first quarter of 2018. This acquisition makes Allianz Insurance Lanka (“Allianz Lanka”) one of the country’s largest general insurers, with a market share of approximately 20%. The acquisition will deliver a range of strategic benefits to all stakeholders.
Janashakthi Insurance PLC will continue to focus on its life insurance portfolio to strengthen its presence in the Sri Lankan life insurance industry, and remains committed to its vision of lighting the lamp of insurance in every home and workplace.
The consideration represents a multiple of 2.2x JGIL’s adjusted net asset value in 2017.
Janashakthi Insurance has been operating in Sri Lanka for over 23 years with a focus on motor, fire and health protection for individuals and corporates.
This transaction also represents one of the largest investments into Sri Lanka, demonstrating Allianz’s confidence in this market. The Sri Lankan general insurance market has posted a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.1% between 2010- 20161. This is expected to accelerate to 12.5% by 2020, driven by improving trade and macro-economic conditions, as well as increased insurance penetration.
George Sartorel, Allianz’s Regional CEO for Asia Pacific, said: “This transaction provides a highly attractive opportunity to transform our market presence in Sri Lanka, while accelerating our growth agenda in the Asia Pacific region.”
Surekha Alles, Managing Director, Allianz Insurance Lanka, said: “We’re excited about our future ahead, and look forward to welcoming Janashakthi customers and employees to the Allianz family.”
Prakash Schaffter, Managing Director, Janashakthi Insurance PLC, said: “I am convinced that this amalgamation with Allianz represents the natural progression of JGIL’s evolution from a small, home grown general insurance business to a leader in the industry, while reflecting the strength of the business we’ve built over the last 23 years. ”
