Petroleum unions call off strike

The Petroleum Trade Unions yesterday decided to suspend their strike action following discussions with President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday.
Ceylon Petroleum Corporation Trade Union Collective Convener D.J. Rajakaruna told the Daily News that discussions ended on a successful note as the President assured his intervention to look into the possibility of assigning the Hambantota Oil Tanks to the CPC.
“The President told us that a new Clause was included into the Hambantota Port Concessionary Agreement to be able to amend it any time even after signing it. Agreeing to our demands on the Hambantota Oil Tanks, the President said he will take them up with the China Merchants Ports Holdings Company. He requested fair time to do so. We have faith in the President and decided to suspend Trade Union action. We hope the President will keep to his word,” Rajakaruna said. The TUs had three major demands, the acquisition of Trincomalee oil tanks complex to the CPC, acquisition of Hambantota Port oil tanks complex to the CPC, and the modernisation of the Sapugaskanda Oil Refinery. However, Rajakaruna said they only stressed the demand on Hambantota Oil Tanks during the meeting yesterday.
Ministers Arjuna Ranatunga, Mahinda Amaraweera and Duminda Dissanayake participated in the meeting alongside with the President. The meeting took place at the Presidential Secretariat. Rajakaruna said the President asked Minister Ranatunga to take up the TU concerns with the Chinese company.
The CPC launched an indefinite strike from July 24 midnight on the heels of inking the Hambantota Port Concessionary Agreement. The strike was temporarily called off following a meeting with the President on July 26.
