Bumper yield of cucumber in East

The Eastern Province highland cultivators and villagers have reaped a bumper yield of cucumber, popular now because of the warm weather prevailing in the Province.
Chena cultivators and villagers who grow cucumber in their home garden earn an extra income as the investment is less but the profit is greater.
Cultivators of cucumber at Kirankulam in the Batticaloa district and Thiraikeny in the Addalaichenai DS division harvested a bumper yield this year. The cultivators have benefited from the crop which has earned them a good income. At present a kilo of cucumber is sold at Rs.80 upwards.
