Reports over imminent No-Confidence move  against SP Minister provoke councillors

The public statement made by Southern Provincial Councillor Chandana Priyantha (UNP) over a prospective No confidence Move against Southern Provincial Minister Weerasumana Weersinghe and Council Chairman Somawansa Kodagoda, had stirred profound concerns of many Southern Provincial Councillors, including ministers.
The Provincial Minister and Council Chairman is alleged for maintaining allegiance towards the Joint Opposition loyalists of the Council and the Council Chairman had conducted the previous Council meeting contravening the Southern Province Governor’s directives requesting him to postpone the meeting without taking the proposed 20th Amendment to the Constitution for discussion at the respective meeting and Minister Weerasinghe had voted against the act at the same meeting together with Joint Opposition loyalists.
Here are comments made by some Councillors of the Council, including the Chief Minister and two Provincial Ministers:
When questioned over the issue, Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal de Silva said that the move gave the impression of an indefinite subjunctive mood act and it was too early to comment on such an unspecified proposal. However, I would not take a personal decision over it. Instead, I would arrive at a collective conclusion. However, I will inform the issue to the party and respond to the proposal accordingly.
Provincial Minister H.W.Gunasena. To vote against a fraternal member of the Cabinet is not ethical and righteous. We are in the same ruling faction. How can we vote against a member who is on our side? Although they act as supporters of the Joint Opposition, we all are in the ruling party. We established the Southern Provincial Council as the United Peoples’ Freedom Alliance (UPFA). We need the support of the Joint Opposition loyalists in the Council. I am prepared to uphold the Cabinet collectiveness. So, I think the proposed No confidence move will be an abortive effort. It is an unwarranted action at this juncture.
Southern Provincial Councillor Chamly Withanachchi (UPFA) – If such an effort is made, we will definitely defeat it. Both the Provincial Minister and Council Chairman did nothing in breach of confidence of the Council or its members. At the said meeting, the Chairman acted according to the majority’s will which was a rightly democratic decision.
Opposition Chief Organizer Asoka Danawansa(UNP) - I am not aware of such a move. During the past few days, I was sick. If a No confidence move was to be submitted to the Council against another councillor, it should be first discussed in the party group before it is processed. That is the due procedure.
Southern Provincial Councillor Nalin Hewage (JVP) - When we pull any card out from a shuffled deck of cards, we get a jack. In the same way, when we change any head of the council, we will get an unscrupulous and corrupted person in place of the predecessor.
The so called Joint Opposition loyalists are not ready to topple the Council until they get the due vehicle permit. It is an attempt just to threaten the minister and get some benefit from him. On the other hand, although there are many criticisms against the minister, he is an innovative minister who is trying to do some useful work through his ministry. Hence we are not interested in that proposed move.
Provincial Councillor Nihal Wedaarchchi ( UNP) - We will stand as a group and respond to the proposal following party instructions. I respect the Chairman for he is a morally principled person and a former teacher. However, I will take a decision according to the party advice.
Ruling Party Chief Organizer Ajith Rajapaksa (UPFA) - Winning of the no-Confidence Motion against the Minister and the Chairman is just a day dream which will not materialize. There should be a two thirds majority in the Council to win such a move. Even the Joint Opposition loyalists who consist the majority of the Council, cannot win such a proposal. The Southern Provincial Council consists of 55 members. The UNP has 15 members, while the JVP has 5 members. So no party has a 2/3 majority.
Provincial Minister Weerasumana Weerasinghe - The projected No Confidence Motion is a prejudicial act manipulated over mere personal detestation. I hope the so called move will be a blessing to me. I have been in politics for over 20 years and bear an unblemished political character. I have never defrauded a single cent from public money.
Although the country’s political power was changed, Southern Provincial Council’s authority remains unchanged. We are not ready to act according to the tune of the UNP. If I am defeated in the anticipated no confidence move, I am prepared to take a firm political decision.
