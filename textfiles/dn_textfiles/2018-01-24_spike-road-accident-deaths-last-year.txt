National Council for Road Safety Chairman Sisira Kodagoda said the number of motorcyclists, cyclists and pedestrians killed on the roads had increased last year.
Among the reasons for this increase are overtaking without proper care, excessive speed, not following or unawareness of road rules,reckless driving, negligence and fatigue.
According to the facts and figures, 2910 road accidents were reported during 2017 with the total number of deaths being 3078.
A majority of the casualties have been identified as motocyclists. Kodagos added that there were 998 motorcycle and 289 push cycle deaths reported last year. Meanwhile,935 pedestrians deaths were recorded last year.
He further said that 239 drivers and 423 passengers died in road accidents last year.
The National Council for Road Safety will conduct special awareness programmes field officers on road rules. Special luminous stickers will pasted on motorcycles for additional safety while a series of programmes will also be conducted to educate the public on road rules.
‘At least ten people die and an average of 10 to 20 people are permanently disabled daily due to fatal road accidents in Sri Lanka,” Kodagoda further said.
He stated that it is necessary to improve drivers’ training, vehicle safety standards, societal concerns and endure strict enforcement of road rules.
“If there is no improvement in a particular area,it can ultimately result in an accident,” he added.
