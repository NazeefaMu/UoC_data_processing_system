It pays to impress if you dress for success!

Beginning with first impressions, no aspect of workplace manners should be overlooked. It all starts with appearance and good grooming. It includes eye contact, a smile, using the customer’s name, a genuine desire to please and a great attitude. Proper professional attire transmits a far important message about you as a skilled business person or professional than you may imagine.
But remember that one size does not fit all in the workplace. Your wardrobe should be governed by the industry in which you work and the climatic environment in which you operate. But the most significant aspect about your dress sense is whether it meets with the approval of your clients.
Not everyone is aware that clothes convey a secret language of their own. They communicate far more than we realise. Good impressions count. Being sloppy or inappropriately dressed may just harm your image in more ways than one. Sending the wrong message about yourself could jeopardise your chances of an upwardly mobile career.
Dressing etiquette
The more perceptive will not have failed to observe that people who fraternise both socially and in commerce or industry dress similarly. Yes they realise the importance of speaking the same language in clothing. That is part of dress etiquette which must never be forgotten.
Dressing etiquette is the way we communicate with our attire. Sartorial elegance has much to do with outfitting oneself appropriately for the occasion. Sri Lankans have still not been able to throw off the mantle of the colonial mindset as far a sensible dress code goes. Before the wide variety of clothing fads, gentlemen wore suits everywhere and ladies wore dresses or saree. Now with the immense clothing preferences, some people simply don’t seem to be able to figure out when and where to tog themselves out in casual or formal clothing.
Your personal appearance is not only an important factor in how you present yourself to others. The way you dress reflects the importance you attach to the situations and people around you. If your clothes are unclean or wrinkled, you may appear to be careless and uninterested in the business situation or people you are interacting with.
Of course, that goes without saying, if you want to dress aptly, you will have to exercise good judgement for the occasion and be aware of the dress code, whether it is stated explicitly or not. Jeans and tee-shirt are not appropriate wear for the office or for conducting business negotiations. Certain business seminar and event organisers do indicate a dress code even for informal dress-down events without being specific. These are some of the new dress codes I have come across. They include Corporate casual, Business casual, Smart casual and Resort casual. Don’t leave invitees confused about your event’s dress code.
The right posture and poise
The first impression of any individual is created by external appearance. Even products are thoughtfully packed for instant appeal. It is imperative that we take utmost care of our appearance of which our clothes and grooming are an integral part.
The trick is to be appropriately dressed for any occasion. Care should be taken that one is neither over or under dressed. The minimum requirement is that clothes should be ironed. Women have an array of clothes to choose from, However in order to create a positive impact senior executives should wear either a saree or a business suit comprising a jacket, shirt, and skirt.
A trouser if not well tailored looks clumsy. Middle-level executives could also follow the same dress code. They also have the option of wearing salwar suits. Women should take care that clothes are not revealing. Low cut blouses and short skirt lengths should be strictly avoided. Bright, gaudy colours for morning events should be precluded and pastels should be preferred.
Still, being aware of what is suitable to wear necessitates as much good taste as it does to dress stylishly. Some of us may imagine our grooming is already immaculate and that we carry ourselves with the right posture and poise. However self-assured we can be in such an event there is a difference. That is because knowing what is appropriate to wear is decidedly not the same as knowing how to dress elegantly.
Good looking
Also, remember that daytime clothes are different from evening clothes. Similarly, evening clothes are worn in the after sundown and never in the day. For day-time wear chose light-coloured clothes such as whites, beige or pastels. Dark colours are too harsh for the daytime. Women should also wear only natural looking make up, with minimal jewellery, unless you are attending a glamorous day event. Low to medium heels are appropriate.
Remember always that when it comes to dressing appropriately for any occasion, your first consideration should be for your hosts. They have put together this event, planned it, and invited you. The least you can do as a guest is to honour their requests for a minimum level of demeanour. It is out of respect for your host that your second consideration arises. So it is always safer to slip up on the conservative side and to be overdressed than underdressed.
Use your best judgement. The goal of business casual is not to draw attention to yourself with your dress. You want to present yourself in a clean, respectable, professional and mature manner. This is not to discourage self-expression through dress, but business casual isn’t exactly the platform for making personal style declarations.
All business attire, whether traditional or casual, should be reflective of a professional, dignified appearance. One should remember that it always helps to look your best, because people like to have good looking people around them. Why? Because it makes them feel good looking too.
