Pharmacy registration fee reduced

The Government spends US$ 800 million to import drugs from abroad, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
<U+200B>According to Minister Senaratne, the registration fee for new pharmacies was increased after a period of 10 years but the fee is now reduced to Rs. 7,500, responding to a request made by the All Island Private Pharmacy Owners Association. He was addressing the Amapara District Summit of the All Island Private Pharmacy Owners Association held recently.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that the commission given to the pharmacies for selling 114 drugs from the State Pharmaceuticals Corporation (SPC) has been increased from 15 percent to 18 percent. Reducing the prices of 48 drugs is a huge loss for pharmacy owners but it benefits 20 million people in the country.
The Health Ministry has also taken several other steps to offer relief to the patients. offering free eye lenses, stents, free lifetime cancer drugs, free blood testing etc. are some of them, he added. <U+200B>
