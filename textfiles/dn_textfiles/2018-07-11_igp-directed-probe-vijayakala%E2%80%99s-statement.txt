IGP directed to probe Vijayakala’s statement

Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya PC yesterday directed Inspector General of Police Pujith Jayasundara to conduct investigations into the statement made by former State Minister Vijayakala Maheswaran at an event held at Jaffna recently.
Maheswaran had said that the LTTE needs to be revived in order to ensure incidents like that of the recent murder of a child in Jaffna does not take place.
The Attorney General when contacted said that IGP has been directed to conduct full scale investigations into this and hand over the investigation report to him soon.
