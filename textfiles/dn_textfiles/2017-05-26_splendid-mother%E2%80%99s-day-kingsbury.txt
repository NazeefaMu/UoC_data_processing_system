A splendid Mother’s Day at Kingsbury

Bringing the fine traditions of a tea dance for the second year, The Kingsbury Balmoral was transformed into a picturesque, elegant setting for what only could be described as the most splendid Mother’s Day event ever!
The Kingsbury experienced a record turnout and all restaurants were packed to capacity for Mother’s day. The next event on the calendar is ‘Father’s Day’ and you can certainly expect The Kingsbury to rise to the occasion once again to pay a fitting tribute to fathers too.
