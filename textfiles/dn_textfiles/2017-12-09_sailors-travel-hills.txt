They are the only club who are unbeaten this season with five wins in as many games and leading the points table. Today they host Navy S.C. in what is expected to be a thrilling, yet one-sided clash in the first leg of their inter -club league match. Everyone knows the role undertaken by the host at their home with conviction and confidence. So, they are all out to put on a good showing in front of their home crowd. In this match they can be clearer about them, finishing the game and it is going to make things smarter than the other games with a good score. Gayan Weeraratne is sure to lead the side to play smart rugby and get the result the way they want. Head-to-head, the difference between the two sets of forwards will be interesting as both play crucial roles for their respective sides, especially in the first half. Kandy will go all out to dominate the game from the kick-off unless the Sailors who are number three in the table stage a huge surprise. For any side it is difficult to beat Kandy at this venue. Head-to-head the battle between the two set of forwards will be interesting as both teams play crucial roles. The forwards are impressive with the ball in hand and will be expected to get their teams over the advantage line with some strong carries, here too the home team has the will power to take the upper hand.

Muttiah who were on the staff and gave the guidance with invaluable advice from A. Athauda, the then principal. Rugby enabled the lads of Vidyartha to pit themselves against lads from reputed schools. Kandy SC helped Vidyartha to improve the game of rugby by permitting them to use the grounds at Nittawela, free of charge at that time.
