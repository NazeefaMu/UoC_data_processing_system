MR says, honestly engaged in Constitutional process

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said his party had honestly engaged in the new Constitutional process and expects national unity and religious harmony through it.
He said this in Parliament yesterday, joining the debate on the Interim Report of the Steering Committee on Constitutional reforms, held for the fourth consecutive day.
“We joined this Constitutional process most honestly. Ending the war was also instrumental in establishing reconciliation according to a proper plan.
“We engaged in the various committees. In fact when this was initiated we had our suspicions, but we did not destabilise the process but supported it.
“We did this for the sake of the country and the people. We expect this constitution to be one that unites the people and creates reconciliation and religious harmony,” he added.
However, he said that while they had discussed and forwarded certain views and suggestions, these were omitted when the report was presented. “Yet, we still did not oppose the government and we still supported them despite the manner in which we were treated.”
He said attention should be paid to the clause determining that demarcation of boundaries would be handed over to an international entity. This, he said is not a wise move and should be reconsidered.
“Pointing out that there is considerable doubt and distrust regarding the constitution and therefore this would not be an opportune moment to bring in a new Constitution,” Rajapaksa said, urging the government to allow all to use their vote in accordance with their inner conscience.
