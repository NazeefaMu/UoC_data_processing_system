No more pain in the neck!

Today Dr. Harindu Wijesinghe (MBBS, MD, MRCP), a Consultant Rheumatologist and Specialist in Sports Medicine attached to Nawaloka Hospitals PLC speaks about Cervical Spondylosis, one of the ailments that affects many in our society. Here are the important facts that you need to know about the disease.
Q : What is Cervical Spodylosis?
A- Cervical spondylosis occurs due to wear and tear of bones and cartilage in your neck. This leads to neck pain and sometimes pain and tingling sensations going into your shoulders, arms and hands. This is one of the commonest diseases worldwide. Cervical spondylosis is age-related degeneration ('wear and tear') of the bones (vertebrae) and discs in the neck. To an extent, we all develop some degeneration in the vertebrae and discs as we become older. It tends to start sometime after the age of about 30. Your neck (cervical spine) is made up of seven bones called vertebrae. These vertebrae are roughly cylindrical in shape between each of the vertebrae is a 'disc'. The discs are made of a tough fibrous outer layer and a softer gel-like inner part. The discs act like 'shock absorbers' and allow the spine to be flexible allowing us to bend our neck and turn it from side to side.
Strong ligaments attach to adjacent vertebrae to give extra support and strength. Various muscles attached to the spine enable the spine to bend and move in various ways.
The spinal cord, which contains nervous tissue carrying messages to and from the brain, is protected by the vertebrae and discs. Nerves from the spinal cord come out from between the vertebrae in the neck.
Q: What are the symptoms of cervical spondylosis?
A- Some people will have wear and tear of the neck (spondylosis) but they will not have pain. While for others they will develop pain in the neck which can range from being mild to a very severe pain. It may be difficult to move the neck. Pain usually is not limited to the neck but can radiate in to the shoulders and hand. It may also go down the spine and radiate up into the head.
Pain in the neck:
This may spread to the shoulders and base of the skull. Movement of the neck may make the pain worse.
The pain sometimes spreads down an arm to a hand or fingers. This is caused by irritation of a nerve which goes to the arm from the spinal cord in the neck.
The pain tends to come and go with exarcebations from time to time. You may have a flare-up of pain after unaccustomed use of your neck.
However, a flare-up often develops for no apparent reason. Some people develop chronic (persistent) pain.
* Some develop neck stiffness, particularly after a night's rest.
* Headaches may occur. The headaches often start at the back of the head just above the neck and travel over the top to the forehead.
* You may develop 'pins and needles' in part of an arm or hand. This symptom is caused by irritation of nerve as it leaves the bony (vertebral) area. This is called a 'cervical radiculopathy'.
* More rarely, clumsiness of a hand, problems with walking, or problems with bladder function occur when pressure from a worn bone (vertebra) or disc damages the spinal cord(nerves going down the legs). This is called 'cervical myelopathy'. Again, it is important to report these symptoms to a doctor.
Q: What are the risk factors of this disease?
A- Aging is the major factor for developing cervical osteoarthritis (cervical spondylosis). In most people older than age 40, the discs between the vertebrae become less spongy and provide less of a cushion. Bones and ligaments get thicker, all these lead to spondylosis.
Another factor might be a previous injury to the neck.Recurrently lifting heavy loads can lead to damage of the discs. Also, jobs in which the neck is kept in the same posture for a prolonged period of time will lead to spondylosis. Ex- Computer work, writing, reading, cooking, cleaning , house work etc....
Q: How do you diagnose this condition?
A-You doctor will ask you about how long you had the pain and other details. He or she will then examine your neck and if necessary check nerves in the arms and legs.
Most patients do not need any further investigation and the diagnosis is made on clinical groundsalone. (based on the details the patient provides and the examination done by the doctor)
* Plain X-ray of cervical spine will show changes of wear and tear of the spine. They will show narrowing of the distance between the bones (vertebrae) which indicates wear and tear of discs.However these changes area common finding even in normal middle-aged patients without pain.
* Patients with neurological abnormality will need magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine, particularly if they have severe pain, weakness or pain going down their arms which is not responding to treatment.
Q: What treatments are available?
 
A- Not everyone needs drugs to treat this condition. If the patient is in severe pain, then pain killers(NSAIDS) such as diclofenac sodium , celecoxib, naproxen, ibuprofen are used . Also analgesics such as Paracetamol , tramadol will be used. If there is pain going down your hand steroids and drugs such as gabapentin and pregabelin may be used. If the patient is not in severe pain patients can be managed without any of these medications.
Also, it is important to realize that currently there is no medicine to grow the worn out cartilage. Drugs like glucosamine and chondroitin are not proven to grow cartilage. Thus these don't play a prominent role in managing spondylosis. All patients are advised to rest for a period of time and specifically avoid any postures or work which makes the pain worse. A neck collar is used for the shortest possible period if the pain is severe. (prolonged use of the collar is not recommended). Though rest is recommended early it is always recommended to avoid prolonged rest and patients are encouraged to start work again as early as possible.
Hot or cold fermentation and various physiotherapy techniquescan be used to reduce the pain.
Exercises are given initially to stretch the tightened and irritated muscle. Later exercises will be given to strengthen the muscles around the neck. It is important to continuously do these exercises to prevent worsening of neck pain. By doing these we can slowly reduce the nerve irritation and the pain. It also important to adopt proper work postures as detailed below to prevent neck pain from reoccurring.
Q: What preventive measures should one adhere to?
A- We can't avoid wear and tear occurring in the neck as it is a normal part and parcel of growing old. As previously mentioned there is no medicine to grow the worn-out cartilage. Drugs like glucosamine and chondroitin are also not proven to grow cartilage.
Preventing further wear and tear of cartilage is the most important thing to do. This can be done with a combination of proper postures and exercises to strengthen neck muscles.
Maintaining the neck in a correct posture during various activities is very important. These activities include sitting, standing, sleeping, driving and various others. The correct position to maintain your neck is as follows. Keep the neck straight and look straight ahead. keep Your ears in line with your shoulders. Your nose should be in line with the mid line of your body. You should try to maintain this position during all activities. Even if you can't do this all the time try to maintain this position whenever possible It is also important not to maintain the neck in the same position for more than 15 minutes. So intermittently take a break from whatever you're doing.
Q: Do cervical collars help?
A- Cervical collars can be worn when you have pain and during any activity which worsens your pain such as travelling in a vehicle. However it should not be worn for prolonged periods as it can weaken the muscles in the neck. Weak neck muscles will lead to long term neck pain.
Q: Is there a need for surgery?
A- Fortunately most neck pains don't need surgery, however if there is a very large disc compression causing weakness of your arms or legs then surgery is needed.
However for other types of neck pains even with severe pain and pain going down your arms it is advisable to try and manage without surgery.
