Dala Poottuwa
The tusker fallen at man’s inhumanity

Tuskers are rare in Sri Lanka. The tusker, having being hunted and persecuted for its ivory for centuries, eventually began to disappear from the gene pool. It was no longer beneficial for the elephant to carry tusks. But once in a while, we have nature throw back a gem, and we are allowed to witness the majestic allure of the tusker. So, Dala Poottuwa was born. A magnificent elephant whose tusks would lightly cross at the end.
Its untimely death and the brutality of the murder would shock the nation. and have it collectively mourn the death of another innocent life taken by man’s eternal greed for wealth.
Dala Poottuwa appears
The elephant had spent most of its life unknown to man. Not many had seen it in the wild. But a chance sighting of its unique tusks made the elephant instantly famous and then on, wildlife officials began keeping a close eye on the animal. They had not seen such a large tusker. The officials noted that this was an important point in the elephant genetic pool in the country and that it could make a great difference to a genetic pool where tusks were fast disappearing.
This elephant unseen by many came into the limelight in 2011. It was born in Galgamuwa and was thus identified as the Galgamuwa tusker. It spread its scent all over fields of Galgamuwa as it would head to the Kala Wewa National Park. Its main ornament, the extraordinary tusks supported by his immense stature.
This elephant who started to frequent Kala Wewa became a marvellous sight to many who would come to watch. As people started to see it more at the Lake and it grew in popularity in the Kala Wewa national Park, wildlife officials became more alert to its whereabouts. By that time, the officials noted that the animal's right eye was almost blind. It was steering himself only with its left eye. But it had the talent to move about kilometres at a time in the jungle without making a single sound.
The elephant who would spend most of his time on his own, would meet his fellow elephants at the lake and thereafter slowly proceed into the reserve through Galkiriyagama, Konpolayagama, and Katukaligama. Its trail created a new environment around it and would at times suddenly re-appear from Madatugama. As it entered the village with much flare, the villagers would run for cover, not knowing what was happening. But the elephant would not worry about this; it would calmly proceed in his journey.
First attack
Wildlife officers in search of Dala Poottuwa.
It was during this journey that it ended up on the main Dambulla-Kekirawa road. An elephant who was not used to development, was perhaps shocked at the sight of the main road with its many vehicles. It started walking along the main road and at that point it kept bumping into oncoming traffic. Its massive body started bleeding. As it struggled with pain, it stopped on the side of the road, it was thereafter that the wildlife officials came looking for him. By that time, it had crashed into around 49 vehicles on the road. Veterinary officials from around the country came to treat it and made great efforts in curing it.
This debacle had put officers in treating the elephant for six months at the Kala Wewa National Park Kurugomu Sevana. As it recovered his strength, its main focus became returning to its home ground in Galgamuwa. But it was no longer strong as it used to be.
It was at this time that an elephant herd entered the Kala Wewa Park; they were ideally suited to help this visiting elephant. This herd had close to 30 elephants and thus all the protection needed for Dala Poottuwa was found within the herd. At times when it did not have the strength to feed himself, the officials observed members of the herd help it out by giving it food and helping it out in various instances. In return, it did not fight with any of its members. The leader of the herd, called Hakki was seen to ensure that Dala Poottuwa was well looked after by her family and they took it back to its home in Galgamuwa. They then left it there and returned to the National park.
Many of the areas in Galgamuwa were this elephant’s stomping grounds. But it was noted for not destroying any paddy fields or farms as it traversed the area looking for food. Hunger would only drive it to uproot one or two cashew trees or eat two or three watermelons growing the area. Apart from that the farmers noted that the elephant did not trouble them at all. The elephant became so well known that one would often see many houses keep pitchers of water outside of their homes so that Dala Poottuwa could quench its thirst.
The villagers of Raswehora, Palukadawela, Usgala, Siyambalangamuwa and Meegalewa were quite accustomed to the elephant and his frequent presence in the area.
Attacks continue
Despite this apparent comradery between the villagers and Dala Poottuwa, in 2015 the elephant would meet a tragic accident at the hands of a treacherous weapon. While walking around in Galgamuwa looking for food as usual, its leg got caught to a trap gun, setting it off and severely injuring his foot.
Its rear left foot was thus hurt and as it walked around suffering with immense pain, unable to cry out for help, its leg started to get infected. Fortunately for him, the wildlife officials eventually got to know of the accident, and they found it and took it in for treatment. But despite their best efforts, they were not able to completely cure the foot. It became partially disabled on his back left foot.
It spent his days thus and as 2016 dawned, tragedy stuck Dala Poottuwa once again during the first half of the year. Reports came in that it had been shot at again. This time, a group of individuals in the Siyambalangamuwa were blamed.
Having heard of the news, I rushed to the crime scene, by that time, many had already encircled the injured elephant and wildlife officials were tending to his wounds.
Wayamba Wildlife Regional Veterinarian Dr. Chandana Jayasinghe and his team worked very hard to cure the elephant who was writhing in pain. As many including myself prayed for his recovery, the doctors were able to cure it.
As 2016 drew to a close, Dala Poottuwa made its usual trip to the Kahallapalla Forest Reserve though Siyambalangamuwa. This was its usual visit to the Kala Wewa to meet his friends. The elephant was reborn once again though its lifespan would not last too long this time around.
On October 16 this year, Dala Poottuwa as usual was walking along chena cultivations and paddy fields and came towards the Moragollagama-Herangama area. It was seen enjoying the produce along the Kahallapalle forest reserve along the Herangama Lake and thereafter it was not spotted for a long time. It had almost vanished without a trace.
Prior to this, Dala Poottuwa had been spotted in June; it had come in search of Palmyra and its seasonal fruits. At around 2pm, it was seen at Gojaragama paddy fields in Galgamuwa along with two other elephants and many received the opportunity to watch them devouruing Palmyra fruits with great pleasure.
Villagers who eagerly watched this great beast marvelled at its calm demeanour and the manner this half blind, limping animal felt its way through kilometres of jungle with no harm to anyone.
The final journey
Not all humans were fans of this elephant. Some perceived the value of its tusks more than its life. On November 22, two suspects were arrested by the Walana Anti-Vice Squad with a set of ivory tusks and six elephant pearls from the Moragollagama-Nikawewa area. At the time, none suspected that these would have come from the famed Dala Poottuwa. Wildlife officials who studied the tusks started to suspect that these had belonged to none other than the Dala Poottuwa.
On November 24, wildlife officials, Civil Defence Force officials, and police officers formed a team to search the forest for Dala Poottuwa. I joined this search operation and together we scanned every inch of the forest, with no rest or food to keep us going but the sheer desire and hope that Dala Poottuwa still might be alive.
But as the days passed by, the hope of finding the elephant alive vanished. The operation though started on 24, did not yield any clue to the whereabouts of the elephant for many days. At the time, the tusks submitted to the High Court had undergone forensic testing proving that they belonged to Dala Poottuwa.
By this time, rumours started to spread around Galgamuwa. They said the killers had brutally killed Dala Poottuwa and cut him to pieces. But the search continued regardless, and the team continued to look for Dala Poottuwa.
Five days later, we started finding certain clues to the crime; the most important being a patch of land the suspects had cleared. It was suspected that they buried the elephant in this clearing, and there were certain areas that had been dug up using a backhoe machine. But having examined this area, we did not find any sign of Dala Poottuwa. As news of Dala Poottuwa’s disappearance spread, the search team grew in size and as a result, the Special Task Force joined in the search.
By the afternoon of the sixth day, the forest was full of officers of the Special Task Force. As we were ready for some breakthrough, an officer of the Herathgama Wildlife Office received a call from another section of the search team, informing him that a carcass of a dead elephant had been found. We all rushed to that area. We travelled around 10km to the spot where they had found the carcass. When we arrived, not only the search teams, but villagers too had flocked to the scene.
Having engaged in the search operations for the past six days, I could not believe what I saw. The camera which captured the majestic pictures of the tusker who roamed the fields of Galgamuwa now zoomed into its rotting carcass in the midst of the forest. Wildlife officials confirmed the carcass to have belonged to the Dala Poottuwa.
As medical officers conducted post mortem into the elephant’s death, the Horowwewa area jungle filled with mourners. The animal having lived 52 years of its life among the man and beast was finally brought down by the bestial nature of man.
