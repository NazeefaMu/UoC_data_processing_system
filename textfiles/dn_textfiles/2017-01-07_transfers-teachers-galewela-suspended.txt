Transfers of teachers in Galewela suspended

Annual transfers of teachers those who served in grade 5 classes in the Galewela educational zone, were suspended until September on the instructions of the provincial Education Ministry.
The parents of the students who gathered around the Galewela education zonal office staged a protest against the transfers of the teachers by the zonal office.
They said the transfers of teachers are unjustifiable. The majority of transfers have been put in place by the authority without replacements.
