Record-breaking flatbread dish

A Lebanese city broke a Guinness world record by cooking up a 144-foot mankoushe, a traditional flatbread dish.
Officials in Rmeileh said the mankoushe, which weighed in at about 330 pounds, measured 144 feet long and about 20 inches wide.
The dish, a flatbread topped with olive oil and zaatar, a mixture of olive oil and pounded thyme, was found to exceed the previous Guinness World Record holder for largest mankoushe, which measured 105 feet long and was made in 2015 in the city of Choueifat, Lebanon.
The mankoushe was dressed with tomato, cucumbers and olives arranged in the shape of the Lebanese flag.
The record attempt was organized by the Mar Antonios NGO as part of Rmeileh's annual festival.
