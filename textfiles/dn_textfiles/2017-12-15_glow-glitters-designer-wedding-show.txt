GLOW  glitters at the  Designer  Wedding Show

The complete skincare nutrient formula, GLOW, took to the ramp at the recently concluded Designer Wedding Show at the Shangri La, Colombo.
A segment in the Bride and Groom fashion show was dedicated to celebrate GLOW, with some of Sri Lanka’s most beautiful models showcasing the brand through designs inspired by the Glow’s signature purple colour. The fashion show highlighted the importance of beautiful and radiant skin for every woman to look and feel her best.
