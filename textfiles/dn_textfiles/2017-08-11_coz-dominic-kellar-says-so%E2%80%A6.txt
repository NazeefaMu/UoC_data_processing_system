Coz Dominic Kellar Says So…

Dominic Kellar and his group of equally eccentric buddies have been to Cocoon Resort & Villas in Induruwa 5 times since 2012, and were most recently at the property about a year ago.
“We love the privacy that Cocoon offers whenever we stay there. We really need to get out of the hustle and bustle of Colombo every now and then and Cocoon is the perfect escape, where we can relax and wind down. The service at Cocoon is impeccable! And the decor is out of this world! We especially are in love with the Grand Villa with its private pool. No one disturbs you ever, and the best part is they’ve never said no to any request I’ve made, and there have been an outrageous few”, states Kellar in a press release issued by Cocoon Resort & Villas.
Celebrating 5 years in the hospitality industry this year, Cocoon Resort & Villas, Induruwaalso notably was awarded the Trip Advisor Certificate of Excellence for the third time in 2016. This accolade pays testament to the level of service and luxurious offering at the property.

For ultimate rest and relaxation for the entire family Cocoon Resort & Villas has its own in-house spa, swimming pool and children’s playground as well.
