Similarly, Corps of Engineer Services (CES) troops with infantry and ground wings began clearing of drinking water wells in several inundated areas in Kalutara under the 582 Brigade Headquarters and the 583 Brigade in Ratnapura as water levels were fast receding and people began returning to their houses.
On Thursday, Security Forces - West Commander Major General Sudantha Ranasinghe went to Agalawatta and Paragoda areas and distributed a large stock of dry rations and essentials among a section of affected civilians. Around the same time, Major General Ranasinghe, as the overall Commander in charge of rescue and relief operations, visited badly-hit Pahiyangala area which has been still predicted as a vulnerable area for sudden erosion of soil or mudslides in the aftermath of heavy rains. In addition, he supervised several places where the troops are conducting relief operations and managed to share a couple of thoughts with them.
Several Senior Officers were also associated with the visit to those places.
