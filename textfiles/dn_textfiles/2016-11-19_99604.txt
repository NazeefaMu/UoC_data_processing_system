Havies go out favourites against CR today

It will be an exciting tussle for supremacy when Havelock’s Sports Club host arch rivals CR & FC in the first leg of the Dialog ‘A’ Division inter-club league rugby tournament match played for the Commander Eustace Matthysz trophy at Havelock Park today. Kick off will be at 4.00pm.
CR red shirts, by which the Ceylonese Rugby and Football club is branded among the rugby loving fraternity in the country and going by how the two teams faired this season, Havelock’s SC have a definite chance of coming on top and this factor makes the event a thrilling tussle.
The trophy is named after Commander Eustace Matthysz, a rugby stalwart and former dynamic Ceylon prop forward who also represented Sri Lanka Navy and Havelock’s SC with distinction before he brought fame and honour to the country as the President of the Asian Rugby Football Union in 1974. This coveted trophy is on offer since 1991 and was won by the Red Shirts in the inaugural year, beating the Park Club by an aggregate of 14 points to 12.
It is the Park Club which won last year by an aggregate of 60 points to 39 after winning both legs (34-18) at Longden Place in the first leg and triumphed at the end of a closely contested battle by 26 points to 21 in the second leg at Havelock Park, hence they are the current holders of the trophy.
In the first match of the league this year Havies beat Air Force 29-5 while CR was really lucky to beat the Army outfit by 25-24. The lads from Longden Place lost to the formidable young Navy side by 21 points to 13 last week at Welisara while Havelock’s carried out a scintillating performance to thrash Police SC by 38-8 at Police Park.
The Park club boys with the presence of a sturdy set of forwards who are capable of pulling the game in their favour will have to play a vital role in today’s game and if the speedy three quarter line of the Havies spearheaded by their dynamic play maker former Peterite and present
national fly half Dulaj Perera delivers the desired results it will be a daunting task for the Red Shirts in countering their attack.
