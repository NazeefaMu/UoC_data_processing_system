Purchase of dry food rations for Security Forces:
MP urges investigation into alleged loss

United National Party (UNP) Matara District Parliamentarian Buddhika Pathirana yesterday urged the authorities to investigate the alleged loss of Rs. 2 billion allocated for raw and dry food rations to the Security Forces.
He further said that the authorities should take immediate measures to investigate any irregularities that occurred when distributing the required food rations without any delay to the Security Forces.
MP Pathirana yesterday lodged a complaint with the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption into the alleged loss of Rs. 2 billion which was to be allocated for purchasing raw and dry food items through the tender process for the Security Forces.
He urged the authorities to take immediate action on this tender issue before which has caused consternation among Security Forces personnel as well as members of the public. Pathirana alleged that certain officials and their henchmen are secretly trying to bypass the tender process in this matter.
"I lodged the complaint against the irregularities made by a female Accountant in the Defence Ministry and the Chairman of the Tender Board," he said. "I met Secretary to the Defence Ministry to discuss this issue and he has already refused this tender due to irregularities. I also expect to take this matter to the Public Accounts Committee in Parliament shortly,” he added.
