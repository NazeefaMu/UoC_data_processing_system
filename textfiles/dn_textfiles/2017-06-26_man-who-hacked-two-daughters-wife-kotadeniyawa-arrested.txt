Man who hacked two daughters, wife in Kotadeniyawa arrested

A man who hacked to death his 6-year-old daughter and caused fatal injuries to his 9-year-old daughter and 42-year-old wife was taken into custody by Police in Batadolekanda, Kotadeniyawa yesterday.
The suspect had gone on rampage on Friday night at his Batadolekanda house attacking his family. He, reportedly, had called his eldest son in Divulapitiya and told him that he had killed his wife and daughters.
The son and a group of villagers had reached the house following the phone call and found the woman and the two daughters lying in a pool of blood. The suspect was arrested by Police yesterday while he was hiding in an abandoned house. He was convicted of manslaughter and several other illegal acts earlier, police said.
