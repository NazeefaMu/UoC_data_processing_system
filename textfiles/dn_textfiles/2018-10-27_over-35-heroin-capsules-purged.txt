Over 35 heroin capsules purged

Two Pakistani suspects have been arrested by the Police Narcotics Bureau of the Bandaranaike International Airport for possessing 35 capsules of heroin worth Rs. 4.2 million.
The police arrested the suspects; a 44-year-old male and a 67-year-old female from Lahore, who arrived at the BIA on a flight from Dubai at 2.50 pm on Thursday.
The police found that the female suspect had swallowed the capsules. Although the male suspect too stated that he swallowed some, no capsules were found in him so far.
The two suspects were taken to the Negombo Hospital and the doctors were able to purge 35 capsules of heroin weighing 350g from the female suspect.
The suspects were produced before the Negombo Magistrate’s Court and detained for seven days.
The Police Narcotics Bureau is conducting further investigations.
