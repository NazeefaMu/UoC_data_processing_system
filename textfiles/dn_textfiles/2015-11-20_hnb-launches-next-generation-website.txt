HNB launches next-generation website

Hatton National Bank launched its brand new website recently. The new site, which targets both individual and corporate customers, was designed to become a benchmark amongst websites in the banking sector.
The HNB website epitomizing user-friendliness was designed to help visitors find the information they want as quickly and easily as possible, presenting the most sought-after information and tools upfront and helping users quickly filter to find the content most relevant to their needs.
Information is provided in an easy-to-skim manner so users can grasp key points quickly in a clutter-free environment.
Users also have the option of downloading applications, contacting the bank through the mode of their choice, or saving information to view later.
The new website designed and developed with Affno (Pvt) Ltd is focusing on today's tech-ready audience, the website is mobile-responsive, adapting to all manner of mobile and tablet devices.
This gives users the benefit of loan calculators, maps, ATM and branch locators and all other features on their mobiles.
Chammika Weerasinghe, Head of Marketing at HNB, said, "HNB is one of Sri Lanka's most visited banking websites and it's therefore essential that it connects with consumers to give them greater control and access to information so they can make informed financial decisions which suit their needs.
The new site with its mobile optimization will make each visit/interaction by any individual more closer to a sale and a rewarding banking experience.
Suren Kannangara, CEO of Affno, commenting on the launch, said, "Affno has been partnering with HNB for over seven years, and it is a relationship we cherish. The site is built on the latest technologies and designed to provide the optimal user experience for HNB clients."
