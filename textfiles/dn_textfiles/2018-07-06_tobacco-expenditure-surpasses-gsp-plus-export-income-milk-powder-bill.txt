Tobacco expenditure surpasses GSP Plus export income, milk powder bill

The Sri Lankan consumers’ annual expenditure on cigarettes and tobacco is so high that it surpasses the country’s annual bill on milk powder imports, said Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen.
The tobacco expenditure also exceeds another income - the annual export revenue from EU GSP Plus.
“Reports say that Sri Lankan consumers spend more than Rs. 200 million per day for cigarettes. According to the World Health Organization in 2015, the direct and indirect cost of tobacco use in Sri Lanka was estimated at Rs. 89 billion or US$ 662 million,” said the minister.
Minister Bathiudeen was addressing the launch of the tobacco farmer research report titled “Farmer Perspectives on Proposed Tobacco Growing Ban and Opportunity to Diversify,” by Dr. Chatura Rodrigo of Green Space Consultancies (GSC) recently.
“We spend more than $ 660 million annually for tobacco and resulting expenses. When we compare $ 660 million with other important values, we can understand the huge cost for the economy due to tobacco use,” said Minister Bathiudeen.
He added: “For example, we spend US$ 400 million a year to import milk powder to be used by our households and hotels. The $660 million we spend for tobacco use is 55 percent higher than our annual bill for milk powder imports. The other example is that Sri Lanka’s annual expenditure on tobacco use is even higher than the additional export income from EU GSP plus which is around $480 million. In that, our annual tobacco and cigarette expenditure is 37 percent higher than our annual GSP Plus income alone.
“Another example is that this annual tobacco cost is equal to total flood and landslide damages incurred by Sri Lanka in both 2015 and 2016. These simple examples show the huge cost to our economy due to tobacco use. Therefore, the government is making attempts to switch the tobacco economy to a more productive livelihood stream with alternative, export driven crops.
As for tobacco production, it is reported that more than 3300 metric tonnes of tobacco are produced in Sri Lanka.”
The tobacco expert panel at the event said tobacco is considered as an industrial crop, more than a commercial crop and since the bulk of the harvest is used for nicotine products, it immediately ends up in industrial/machine processing, unlike many other commercial crops. Among all types of full-time farmers in Sri Lanka, tobacco farmers are one of the most profitable, earning regular margins of 20 percent or higher.
The ban on tobacco cultivation in Sri Lanka is scheduled to start from 2020. The importation of cigarettes and tobacco will also be banned from 2020.
