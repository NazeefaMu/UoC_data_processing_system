A promising journey by CIM SL Student Committee

A fruitful journey of success by the student committee of the Chartered Institute of Marketing (CIM) Sri Lanka 2016, brings down the curtain winding up the year on a high note.
Under the leadership of Malithi Herath, the energetic forward thinking marketer’s pulled off three successful events, elevating the marketing fraternity in Sri Lanka. “KavumKokis” – Avurudhu with a twist, was the first on the agenda.
The CIM Future Marketers Conference 2016 was the succeeding event, which kicked off in style at the Hilton Colombo Residence for the fifth consecutive year on the 10th of September 2016. “Branding in the Digital Era” being the topic on role, sowed the seeds of success as the tickets were sold out prior to the event.
With successful events on the cards, the committee winded up with the third and final event a social initiative under the theme “SMILE” by visiting Ketewela Kanishta Vidyalaya located in the Kurunegela district.
‘SMILE’ reached its ultimate success on October 29 2016, when the 19 member squad touched the hearts of the pupils with their epic generosity as the team entertained the children by getting them actively involved in fun filled activities and also shared practical business and marketing knowledge and insights which will benefit them in future.
The president of the CIM Sri Lanka student committee 2016, Malithi Herath shared her views on her journey with the committee “It was indeed a great pleasure and an amazing experience to represent the CIM student marketing professionals of Sri Lanka. The committee members played a vital role working as a team on all three projects delivering beyond expectations for an efficacious 2016.”
“ My heartfelt thank you to Sanjika Perera (Immediate past Chair), Sumudu Thanthirigoda (Head of Education for 2015-16), G.S Sylvester (Advisor to the Student Committee), Onalie Dissanayake (Manager Education Services), Sandamali Silva (Assistant Manager Education Services) and the CIM office staff led by Major General Udeni Munasinghe for the valuable help and great support.

An year crowned with success, the Student Committee of the Chartered Institute of Marketing Sri Lanka 2016 blows the whistle on and wishes the upcoming committee for a flourishing 2017.”
