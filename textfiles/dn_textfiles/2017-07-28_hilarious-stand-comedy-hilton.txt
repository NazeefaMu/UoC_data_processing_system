Hilarious Stand up Comedy at the Hilton!

The Thomian Society is gearing up for another of their famed Dinner Theatre events this Sunday but this time with a twist! They will host the first FREDDY Stands Up show directed by Ferose Kamardean featuring a stand up comedy from 4 distinguished performers - Dominic Kellar, of Pusswedilla fame, Gehan Blok, Dino Corera and DamindaWijayaratne.
This Stand up comedy show promises a fun-filled evening of laughter. In fact, all four performers have a common bond in that they were all part of the hugely popular Pusswedilla Plays.
While Dominic played the title character of the lovable dictator, His Glorious Honourable Excellency ChamindaPusswedilla, Gehan Blok played the constantly outsmarted journalist, Robert Westernthinking. Dino Corera portrayed the envoy of the the British Government, Lord Bryce Pontlewhaite while DamindaWijayaratne played the grovelling street-smart Minister, Honorable Sweetie Bolay.
With all the cast having become famous in political comedy, FREDDY Stands up also takes a political twist with each of the performers discussing life in Sri Lanka in the light of political humour. From the garbage crisis to the GMOA, to the second anniversary of the National Unity Government, to the prospect of a burger President, FREDDY STANDS UP promises to be to great evening of entertainment.
Speaking to this newspaper, FREDDY said “the boys have been very hard at work and finding solutions to some of these problems has been challenging, but we seem to have figured out most of them. In addition to the political issues, we are also trying to find answers for the following:
What is Colombo's fascination with the Hi Magazine?
Why is S. Thomas' College not spelt St. Thomas' College?
Why do most Australians talk in questions?
What is etched in our Sri Lankan DNA?
What's the best place to get a boat to go to Australia?
further, freddy cautioned people coming for the show, saying : “this show is for adults only. this show contains language & situations that some people might consider offensive.
recording of this show by any means, audio or visual is strictly prohibited.
All Children should be left at home under the care of a responsible adult. Should any children be smuggled into the venue, it is quite possible that they may get an accelerated course in profanity. I strongly recommend that Adults pay due attention to the fact that I have previously stated that this show is for Adults Only.”
FREDDY STANDS UP! Stand-up comedy show comes up on stage at the Colombo Hilton this Sunday, 30th July. Tickets, naturally, selling like hot cakes! For more information call Monisha on 112 574083.
