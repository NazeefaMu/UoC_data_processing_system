“Morning of Friendship – The Garden Party” unveils this Sunday

The Interact Club of Ananda College has organised “Morning of Friendship”, an event which brings together Interactors from across Sri Lanka, set to take place on Sunday, June 4 at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute Lawn from 8 am onwards. This is the 21st occasion that the Club has organised it.
“Morning of Friendship” has been incarnated as garden party this year and will host Interactors from across the country with Victorian attire and elegance.
The event has a colourful history behind it, with its founder being none other than Bathiya Jayakody, who was the President of the Interact Club at Ananda in his time. The Club celebrates its 35th Anniversary this year.
The 11th, 14th, and 16th instalments of MOF won citation awards for the Best Club Service Project in 2004, 2007, and 2009 respectively. In 2013 and 2014 it was carried out under the name Project Innovation Revolution and won the Most Innovative Project Award at the annual Interact District Assembly.
