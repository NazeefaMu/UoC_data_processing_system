Galle Face Hotel hosts United States Congress Reps.

South Asia’s leading Grande Dame, the Galle Face Hotel is one of Colombo’s most iconic institutions. For over 150 years, the landmark hotel has set the bar for luxury accommodations and is the preferred choice for guests. Recently, the hotel was host to a group of United States Congress Representatives who were in Sri Lanka to visit President Maithripala Sirisena, and promote strengthened democratic institutions.
The iconic hotel has a long-standing history of hosting prominent guests, counting among them Sir Arthur C. Clarke, John D. Rockefeller, Carrie Fisher and Indira Gandhi to name a few. “It is our distinct pleasure to have welcomed the delegation of Congressmen from the United States of America on their recent visit to Sri Lanka this week. Over the years, The Galle Face Hotel has been the choice for many foreign dignitaries during their visit to Colombo. We take pride in blending both old world charm and modern sensibility resulting in memorable experiences for all our patrons.” said Mr. Mubarak Gaffoor, Director Sales and Marketing, Galle Face Hotel.
No visit to Sri Lanka is complete without staying at this majestic hotel, built in 1864 and restored back to its former glory last year. The Galle Face Hotel recently won a Travellers’ Choice award in a survey that was conducted by TripAdvisor.
Ranked as one of the Top 25 hotels to visit in Sri Lanka, the award is a testament to the exceptional service and attention to detail that Galle Face Hotel has consistently been known for.
South Asia’s leading Grande Dame, the Galle Face Hotel is testimony to both Sri Lanka’s colonial past and its independent present. Celebrated within the hospitality world, it blends historical splendour with crafted modernity to form a new model for heritage properties.
Celebrating 150 years, the Galle Face Hotel is one of the landmarks in Asia and was acclaimed as one of the best heritage Hotels in Sri Lanka in 2012. Further it is the first Hotel in the country to be featured on a postage stamp.
