Promises KEPT

Followed by his avowal at the funeral of Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera to abolish the Executive Presidency, President Maithripala Sirisena initiated action at the following Cabinet meeting by seeking to pursue his intentions. The Cabinet decided to appoint a committee comprising party leaders to study the proposal to abolish the Executive Presidency and to introduce a new electoral system. In the aftermath of the President’s announcement a discussion has started in SLFP circles; interpretations were made in such political circles about the real intention of the President. It is true that even if Maithri did not plan a political future beyond this presidency, now he is forced to be the leader of the SLFP for the coming period.
Obviously he does not want to leave politics with the blame of destruction of the SLFP. As a populist political leader he may consider himself as the leader who resurrected the SLFP and pulled it away from the racist reactionary pit of Mahinda. Once presidency is abolished then he is compelled to contest the next parliamentary election as the Prime Ministerial candidate of the party. His genuine desire to live up to what he promised to the people at the election does not give him any other alternative. However with Ranil taking somewhat a post modernist political position it may be difficult for him to separate from Ranil’s political practice.
National government
Along with such serious business happening in the background, the Cabinet recently discussed other matters that have led to antagonism among the ministers. At one point, several ministers took Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva to task over his criticism of the ‘Yahapalana Government’. de Silva’s criticism spread in cyber space with various websites and social media carrying different stories to suggest that the national government is now fragile. He is reported to have said that the Yahapalana government has been shattered, leaving people in the lurch. If Nimal Siripala continues in this path he may fall into the lap of Mahinda.
The UNP-SLFP National Government is now disturbed with differences. But, it is united and determined to expedite action in conformity with the UNHRC resolution. The release of LTTE suspects, held under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), is a serious political issue and unfortunately the government has not completed the process. It has to be taken out of AGs department as a political problem to be dealt with rehabilitation. Alongside, the government mulls the repeal of the PTA, a proposal even outlined in the OHCHR report. Action will be expedited by the pressure exerted by democratic organizations. The campaign for general amnesty by the democratic movements has stirred up tension among “patriotic” movements in the South led by the trio Wimal, Gune and Dinesh.
Political parties
May be to face the fascistic trio, President Sirisena called for the second meeting of the Political Party Conference to discuss the way forward for the resolution of political questions and to bring about reconciliation. Several political parties had submitted their individual proposals to be considered in this respect. Eastern Province Governor Austin Fernando had assembled these proposals together, highlighting the submissions acceptable to all, and drawing attention to areas with differences. Common ground was found on matters such as the implementation of the recommendations by the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC), addressing livelihood issues in the war ravaged areas and schemes for the benefits of war widows. Communist Party leader limited himself to the demand for action without delay on commonly acceptable matters, though DEW claimed that the Cabinet was wasting time, Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera briefed the political party representatives for around ten minutes, with particular focus on the substance of the UNHRC resolution on Sri Lanka and the procedure on follow up action.
International interferences
After the minister’s remarks, Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) Leader Dinesh Gunawardena made a strong criticism for not presenting the reports of the Udalagama and Paranagama Commissions to the UNHRC for lobbying against international interferences. He condemned the government for relying solely on the report by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). Samaraweera hit back by explaining that the contents of these two locally produced reports were far more serious in depicting crimes on the Lankan side than those in the OHCHR report. Nevertheless, Gunawardena, who is a fascistic leader in the campaign against the UNHRC resolution, affirmed, these were locally produced reports based on the ground realities, but the OHCHR had compiled its reports based on hearsay and evidence gathered from anonymous sources! So Dinesh confirms that serious crimes were committed by the Lankan side too. President Sirisena also allowed Gunawardene to take his time and put forth his views. So there cannot be any mistake.
Though UNHRC resolution does not make the presence of foreign judges compulsory, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), represented by Vijitha Herat, was opposed to the participation of foreign judges. M.A. Sumanthiran, who represented the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), enraged fascistic participants when he said that the implementation of the provisions of the UNHRC resolution virtually became the policy of the government as a co-sponsor of it. LSSP representative Tissa shamelessly took the side of fascistic gang. Tissa condemned Sumanthiran and said the consultation process with the other parties would not serve the intended purpose if that were the case. Maithri’s political party conference served its purpose by exposing the fascistic chauvinist campaigners hiding behind his leadership.
