Tribute to Venerable Professor Bellanwila Wimalaratana Anunayake Thera
A life well lived

Not so long ago (one week back, to be precise) did we have this very same column allocated in memory of a national icon. The sudden departure of Dr Dharmasena Pathiraja shocked the nation. By coincidence, one week later, we have to fill the very same space with an obituary of another national figure, Venerable Professor Bellanwila Wimalaratana Anunayake Thera.
They both roamed in different paths but strived to make their voice count in the national interest. With a sound academic background, both Venerable Wimalaratana Thera and Dr Pathiraja illumed the seats of learning they represented. Every now and then, they had the courage to step out of their comfort zones. If Dr Dharmasena Pathiraja introduced a radical vein to the local cinema, Venerable Professor Bellanwila Wimalaratana Thera syringed an out-of-the-box cadence to the Sri Lankan standing of Buddhism.
The Sinhalese Buddhist community scattered around the globe have placed the Bellanwila Rajamaha Vihara on a higher pedestal of reverence. Perched in the outskirts of the city of Colombo, in the village of Bellanwila, the temple is one of the most looked-up-to religious sites next to Kandy’s Sacred Tooth Relic and Anuradhapura’s Sacred Jayasri Maha Bodhi. The much-blessed abode is where the majority of the upper-middle-class Sinhala Buddhist community seek solace mostly in times of trouble. Venerable Wimalaratana Thera was the Deputy Incumbent of this Vihara.
Bellanwila Raja Maha Viharaya
April 14, 1942, remains a date to recall for those versed in the cost of Ceylon in World War II. That April 14 was celebrated as the Sinhalese New Year auspicious day is obvious knowledge. This day of 1942, in particular, was not so looked forward to. The Ceylonese were already alarmed with the Japanese planes bombing the city of Colombo. It was to this world that a baby boy named Omattage Gilbert Perera was born. Becca Fitzpatrick was quite apt when she said that sometimes bad things have to happen before good things can. That said, this memorable day of 1942 will be remembered with much esteem.
Gilbert entered the Sangha Order on February 28, 1956, at the Bellanwila Raja Maha Viharaya. Then onwards he was to be known as Venerable Bellanwila Wimalaratana Thera. The Thera studied under the guidance of Venerable Molligoda Sri Ariyawansa Thera.
His life as a student is worth a note. Venerable Wimalaratana Thera has studied at many revered seats of learning such as Pravachanodaya Pirivenas in Molligoda, Wadduwa and Vidyalankara Pirivenas at Peliyagoda and Dematagoda. Upon completion of the secondary education, the Thera secured admission to the Vidyalankara University. At Vidyalankara, Venerable Wimalaratana Thera had encounters with colleagues such as Venerable Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera who would later make waves in the country.
Having obtained the BA from the Vidyalankara University, Venerable Wimalaratana Thera joined the teaching staff of Sunethradevi Pirivena in Pepiliyana in 1965. He was also the Principal of Parama Dhamma Chetiya Pirivena, Ratmalana, from 1966 to 1969. In 1980, Venerable Thera obtained the PhD from the University of Lancaster, United Kingdom, for his doctoral thesis on the Maha Purusha concept in Buddhist literature and sculpture.
The Sangha Order is twofold with urban and forest traditions. The forest monks are more attentive to seeking solitude in meditation, while the urban monks focus on studying the Buddha’s teachings and safeguard it for posterity. Both traditions are vital to sustaining the Master’s teachings. Venerable Bellanwila Wimalaratana Thera belonged to the latter tradition that fostered the Buddha’s teachings.
Venerable Dr Bellanwila Wimalaratana Thera entered the University of Sri Jayewardenepura as a lecturer. Following the demise of his mentor, Venerable Bellanwila Somaratana Thera, on August 2, 1984, Venerable Wimalaratna Thera became the unofficial Chief Incumbent of the Bellanwila Rajamaha Vihara. Venerable Dr Bellanwila Dhammaratana Thera, his lay brother who was to succeed Venerable Somaratana Thera, was serving as the Chief Sangha Nayaka Thera in Singapore at the time. The Thera became a professor at Sri Jayewardenepura University in 1987.
Social and religious projects
The Thera was appointed the Chancellor of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura on two occasions: first by former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga in 2000, second by the incumbent President Maithripala Sirisena in 2015. He was also a Visiting Professor at the School of Oriental and African Studies University of London, United Kingdom.
The Venerable Thera was a busy figure. Bellanwila Raja Maha Viharaya, of which he is the Deputy Chief Incumbent, is one of the most crowded places, for one. He was the guiding figure behind the Pilgrims’ Rest, the 1200-student Dhamma School, the Bellanwila Community Development Fund and many other social and religious projects.
The Bellanwila Community Development Foundation provides training in 14 vocations to youth in the area, especially those who miss university entrance. Venerable Wimalaratana Thera also ran a day care centre for elderly parents of working couples, in addition to free medical clinics for residents in the area. The Bellanwila Perahera was also held under his supervision. The Thera used to walk the entire length of the Perahera.
Despite his busy schedule, Venerable Professor Bellanwila Wimalaratana Thera tried his level best to offer a helping hand to the needy.
Among the various books in both Sinhala and English, authored by the Thera, are ‘Buddhism, Society and Environment’, ‘Buddhism among other Religions’, ‘Concept of Great Man’ and ‘Buddhist Literature and Iconography’. His writings appeared in the Press as well.
Venerable Wimalaratana Thera was known more for his controversial views.
He stood the ground whenever he deemed it a national concern. Whoever takes the highest office of the political authority paid obeisance to this great Sangha figure. He employed his Sangha civil power to campaign for peace as well as reconciliation.
Coincidences are hard to believe at times. But what is even harder to believe is when the greats leave us without warning. Let us keep our fingers crossed that we may not have to run another premature obituary next week while praying for a comfortable Sansaric journey for Venerable Bellanwila Wimalaratana Thera.
