Health Minister receives report on private hospital

The report on private hospitals in Sri Lanka handed over to Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne by Health Services Acting Director General Dr. Jayasundara Bandara recently, Health Ministry sources said.
The report was compiled by the KGMP, an international company, after examining the fees that 40 private hospitals in all parts of Sri Lanka charge for their services. Private hospital charges differently for various health services. Regulating private hospitals will be commenced after looking into the report by the minister and formulate a system soon, the sources said.
The Act on establishing the Private Health Services Regulatory Council is to be amended soon. A three-member committee was appointed for the task and the committee will hand over its report to the minister within three months, the sources said.
