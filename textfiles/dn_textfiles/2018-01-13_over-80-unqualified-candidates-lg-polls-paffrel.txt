Over 80 unqualified candidates at LG polls - PAFFREL

Around 80 unqualified contestants are included in nomination lists to contest the forthcoming local government elections, PAFFREL said.
People’s Action For Free And Fair Elections (PAFFREL) Executive Director and Attorney Rohana Hettiarachchi during a meeting between the Election Commission and political party representatives said that if those persons were allowed to take oaths, if they win, PAFFREL will go before Courts.
He pointed out that those who have entered into financial agreements for contracts with a particular Pradeshiya Sabha are not eligible to contest for the same.
During the meeting it was decided to extend the canvassing hours from 7 pm to 9 pm. He said none of development projects that would enhance the image of the contestants would not be allowed to begin during this period. PAFFREL has received more than 360 complaints, while the Election Commission has received 424 complaints.
