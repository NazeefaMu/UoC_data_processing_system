Poachers hunting wild animals nabbed

Two poachers who hunted rare wild animals in the Nikawearatiya area disguising themselves as paddy farmers have been arrested with two firearms.
Both of them were found to be residents of Nikaweratiya area of Kurunegala District. Both are fathers of two children and later it was revealed that their livelihood was hunting wild animals and selling their flesh to tourist hotels in the area.
A Police team led by Nikaweratiya ASP Samarakoon Bandara had arrested the suspects.
