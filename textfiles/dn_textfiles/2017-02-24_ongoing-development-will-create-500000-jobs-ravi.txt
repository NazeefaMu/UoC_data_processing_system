Ongoing development will create 500,000 jobs: Ravi

The ongoing development projects under the administration of the Good Governance regime will generate 500,000 jobs within the next six months, said Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
He said therefore, the youth should prepare for the big opportunity. Karunanayake said this at a ceremony to lay the foundation stone for a swimming pool at Vystwyke Park in Mattakkuliya on Wednesday.
Karunanayake said the government is facing a problem in providing employment as the majority of youths are seeking employment in the public sector.
“The youth give preference to government sector employment. But the private sector salaries a much higher, perhaps three times higher than the public sector. However, private sector employees are expected to work three times harder than expected in the public sector.
Around 500,000 jobs will be generated under the ongoing development projects within the next 6 months. When a foreign investor is prepared to offer 1,000 jobs, we only have 100 qualified applicants. This situation should change," he said adding that an attitudinal change in youth is essential.
" Indian Prime Minister Narasimha Rao changed the social situation in India two decades ago. India, receives its highest revenue from America through Information Technology today as a result. We should also follow that system," he said.
He said when the government tries to do something innovative, the bankrupt Opposition is quick to level allegations. "However, we are not deterred by such allegations. Dynamic people are always targeted. If we too were inactive, nobody would have blamed us. Therefore, we do not work according to the advice of the Opposition but according to the advice of the people,” Karunanayake said.
The foundation stone was laid for the swimming pool and construction is expected to be completed by next October at a cost of Rs.100 million .
Meanwhile, the foundation stone for the sports complex on 17th Lane in Kotahena was also laid by the minister. The project will cost Rs.50 million. Colombo Municipal Council Commissioner V.A. K. Anura and several former Municipal Councillors participated.
