Swap to  healthy food

There are many ways you can teach and support your children in eating healthy.
Start with breakfast
Eating a balanced breakfast with protein is a great way for your child to start their day. Protein can help them stay fuller longer. It even can help teenagers lose weight.
Make mealtimes a priority
Sitting down at the table, as a family is an important part of establishing healthy eating habits but it’s more than just eating together. Mealtimes are also a chance to:
Provide your kids comfort
Children thrive on routine. Knowing they have dinner or other meals with their family regularly helps them feel safe.
Talk with your kids
Show interest in what’s going on in their lives. Tell them what’s going on in yours. Build stronger connections among your family members.
Monitor their eating habits
Older kids and teenagers spend more time eating at school or at friends’ houses. Use this time to watch what and how they eat. See if there is anything you can do to encourage better habits.
Set an example for your child
If you prepare and eat healthy foods yourself, your child will eat healthier, too. Avoid obsessive calorie-counting. Don’t talk negatively about yourself. Your child could adopt the same attitudes. This could lead him or her to develop body image issues or negative associations with food.
Get kids involved
Have your kids help you shop for groceries and choose food to eat. Teach them how to read a food label so they know the nutrition in the foods they’re choosing. They can also help fix meals and take some ownership in what they’re eating.
Another fun way to involve your child is to plant a garden. Growing some of your favourite fruits, vegetables, and herbs can teach children valuable lessons. Planting, maintaining and harvesting your own food is satisfying. It can be a fulfilling experience for children and adults alike.
Make small shifts to healthier foods
You don’t have to overhaul your entire meal plan. Just find a few alternatives to unhealthy items in your fridge or pantry. Slowly start adding in more until you’ve adopted healthier food choices.
Limit sugar
Sugar occurs naturally in many foods. These include fruits, vegetables, grains, and dairy products. We get all the sugar we need from these foods.
Many foods have added sugar. At best, all this extra sugar just adds empty calories to our diets. At worst, it can contribute to hyperactivity, mood disorders, obesity, and type 2 diabetes.
Sugar is often added to foods we wouldn’t think had sugar in them.
These include breads, canned soup or vegetables, condiments such as ketchup, frozen meals, and fast food. For the best health, we should avoid or reduce the amounts of these foods we eat.
