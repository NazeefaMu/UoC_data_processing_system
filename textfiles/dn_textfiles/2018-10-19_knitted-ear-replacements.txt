Knitted ear replacements

Mimi the tiny bunny is completely deaf and has only three legs. But thanks to a loving owner, neither of these things hold her back.
Mimi’s owner is Rodajia Welch, 22, who decided that she’d make her rabbit some woolen ears to stand in for her missing ones.
The charity worker brought home Mimi, her mother, and the rest of the litter after their elderly breeder became too ill to care for them.
Mimi looks a little different to her brothers and sisters. Not wanting her to feel left out, Rodajia set to work knitting her a set of ears. On an average day the bunny will wear white knitted ears with a pink middle, but she sometimes experiments with knitted flower crowns and rounded mouse ears.
“Deciding to make the ears all started with finding her a name – it obviously had to be ear-related,” said Rodajia.
“So while doing some research my boyfriend Josh came across Kemonomimi, which is a form of cosplay where the characters have animal ears. It was perfect because she didn’t have any ears and she could be whatever she wanted to be. I got super excited and decided to make her her own pair of bunny ears.”
Rodajia adopted Mimi after the 77-year-old who bred the litter was forced to give up the rabbits after falling ill.
Rodajia will take care of all the bunnies until they’re old enough to be separated, then will keep Mimi as her pet.
“Mimi is the runt of the litter and was born with no ears and three legs – she’s missing a front one,” she said.
“She’s the runt and a lot smaller than the others so I believe that it was maybe a lack of oxygen or not enough nutrition for development. She only wears the ears after I’ve just made them for pictures, or when she’s sitting with me. She lets me put them on her but for safety reasons I don’t tie them in a knot so if she wanted to, she could just knock them off pretty easy. She doesn’t act like she’s bothered by them – usually she’s eating so she doesn’t pay much attention. Sometimes she will try to eat the ribbon but then I take them off or move it so she can’t get it. The other bunnies aren’t around when I put them on, they would probably try to chew on them.”
