No gratitude: Only a crooked attitude!

This is the concluding episode of a script for a teledrama sitcom. The cast includes a family, the father, a leading Colombo lawyer Vijay Gansabhapathi PC, the mother Vimala, a housewife, and son Harin, a university student. A busybody next door neighbour, Rasawathie Ginipella. The Ginipella husband (not in the cast but is often referred to) and wife are portrayed as political opportunists, who sway with any favourable gust of political wind. A smaller cameo role is intended for a Mrs Gutiweera, a battered opposition activist seeking legal help from Mr. Gansabhapathi following a beating.
Continued from last Tuesday
Script: By Gaston de Rosayro
Concluding the continued sitcom
Rasawathie: “I am only begging of you all not to tell Maraman what I said and did. You know what that rascal can do especially if he knows that I went against him. But he can be a useful bugger when it comes to helping you make money and giving political protection. You don’t worry Guti, I will get him to pay you top damages.
Gutiweera: “But Rasawathie, you promised. You promised that you will help me file a case and get that man jailed. Now you are saying just the opposite and running off to entertain the man who you said didn’t raise a finger to help your husband. What you really wanted was not to help me but to take revenge on Maraman for not using his influence to give your husband a top state posting.”
Rasawathie: “Sorry, Gutiweera. No use in explaining to you. You can’t understand. He is coming to say he is sorry and to offer Gini something very big. Sure, must be Ambassador’s job or something like that. I can feel it. I can feel it in my heart.”
Gutiweera: “Heart? Heart? I never knew you had one! Go and dance the devil with your yakka poiltikka. You and your husband! Anyway I must thank you for introducing me to a brave and honest lawyer. For God’s sake go and do your thovil dance with that devil!”
Harin: (In an aside to Mrs Gutiweera). “Someone must have mistaken her thyroid gland for her heart!”
Rasawathie: (Ignoring the taunt). “Vijay, what is the use of putting FR case. These things are common, they are happening everyday, no. No one is taking any notice now. These are small things, no? After all Maraman is a powerful man, chile. I will ask Gini also to speak to him about a settlement. What is the use for anybody if he goes to jail. Nothing for nobody then. We can all profit if he settles the case. I told you he is steamrolling in money. ”
Vimala: (Disappointedly wagging her finger at Rasawathie). “To tell you the truth Rasawathie I am shocked at your attitude. You have absolutely no principles, no morals and keep changing your opinions like a chameleon. I actually thought that you had some sympathy for your friend here and that is why you brought her to Vijay to see that justice is done. I now realize that both you and your husband Ginipella are nothing but opportunistic political bootlickers.”
Vijay: “I suppose the minister might offer Gini a post as chief ministerial shoe-shiner. That would be a most suitable post for him. Anyway, Rasawathie, it would be wise to remember that money and power cannot buy happiness or a good name by any stretch of the imagination. Besides, it is because of people such as you that our society has descended to such low depths.”
Rasawathie: (Stamping her foot): “What low depths, men? With money and power people will put you high up on the murunga aththa. That is the problem with you calling yourselves happy independent people. You don’t give two ‘hoos’ for power and big bank accounts just because you are a big shot lawyer. But as far as we are thinking we will do anything to stay on top and be rich. Why can’t you understand that? All you people are pretending to be goody giddy or something and for lies you are telling that money is a dirty thing!”
Harin: “Understand what? That you have convinced us that people like yourselves are thoroughly greedy and selfish. That you are the type who will sell your name for a mess of pottage. You will sell your friends and perhaps yourself and even your grandmother for a filthy pile of money! You are the most amoral type of person it has been my misfortune to ever encounter.”
Rasawathie: “Aiyo you stupid brat. What pottage? This is not the kussiamma age of pottage or pottery or chatty pots. Nowadays we are cooking in all steel pans and modern kitchen applications. Values, values. What values? The only value these days is money, big, big money. How it comes does not matter, chile. Everybody is taking no.
Why not us? You are a fool just like your parents. Principles, values, decency? What is the use of all this if you don’t have money? If you don’t have money you are miserable, you are a beggar. Ask anyone, will you! You will soon learn that in Sri Lanka happiness only cannot buy money!”
Exit Rasawathie. Flaunts out without looking back. Camera cuts into bewildered group in living room. They all look at one another.
Harin: “Bye, bye you miserable, opportunist. Aunty money-bags!”
Harin suddenly begins to laugh uncontrollably. The laughter turns infectious as the others join in. Camera quietly fades as the rollicking theme song is played to a baila beat. The lyrics go:
‘Aney, Aney, magey paney,
Aney, Aney watch the cabaret,
Sure to take your breath away,
Making hay, come what may,
Everyday is commission day
We only have the devil to pay,
So gangway to go astray,
When betrayal is your sobriquet.’
The gathering is convulsed with hilarity as Mrs Gutiweera prances to the beat of the music raising her skirt slightly while screaming with mirthful exuberance. The others clap to the beat while Harin joins Gutiweera’s dance routine.
Periphery titles appear on the screen as the music fades and the scene diminishes.
