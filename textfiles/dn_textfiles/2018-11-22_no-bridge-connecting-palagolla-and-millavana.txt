No bridge connecting Palagolla and Millavana

There has been no bridge to connect Palagolla and Millavana for a long time, villagers said. They said that a 20-foot-wide stream separated the two villagers and hence, residents—especially schoolchildren—had faced difficulties when travelling.
The Palagolla village is located 3km away from Medipola and consists of 50 families.
K.G. Leelawathi, a 52-year-old resident of the area, said that patients and schoolchildren had died attempting to cross the stream, that often was seven feet deep during rainy seasons.
She added that the majority of residents there were elderly, adding that youths usually left the village after getting married due to the inconvenience.
G.M. Heenmenike said that politicians had previously pledged to set up a bridge, but no action had been taken.
