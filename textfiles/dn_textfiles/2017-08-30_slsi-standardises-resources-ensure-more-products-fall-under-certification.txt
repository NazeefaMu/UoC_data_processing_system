SLSI standardises resources to ensure more products fall under certification

Sri Lanka Standard Institute (SLSI) has standardised their resources to ensure that more products fall under the necessary certifications, said Director General Gamini Dharmawardena.
He said that today both the consumer and manufacturer are looking for quality products. In some cases consumers compromise price for quality. “This is a good sign as it would entice manufacturers to ensure higher qualityof their products.”
SLSI provides training on standardization and quality management for personnel in the industry with a view to imparting the knowledge base required for producing good quality products and services.
SLSI covers training programes on Standardization and Quality Management, ISO 9000 Quality Management Systems, ISO 14000 Environment Management Systems and other quality related fields for all grades of industrial personnel; viz top management, middle management, executives, supervisors, technicians and shop floor workers.
“As the national standards body in Sri Lanka, SLSI provides quality services at very competitive rates and is backed by its long service record of being in the certification, inspection and testing business for over 40 years. SLSI is supported by a large pool of technically competent, well qualified and experienced professionals.”
With a total of about 50 lead auditors, mostly full-time, they can provide auditing services covering a wide range of economic activities.
Almost all these professionals are also well trained to be multi-skilled and thus are competent to carry out audits of integrated schemes. For example, an ISO 9000/ISO 14001/OHSAS 18001 covering product certification audits.
“Likewise, the tests are conducted to national and international standards using up-to-date testing facilities operated by competent staff.”
The ‘SLS’ mark has been granted to factories based in China, India, Singapore, UAE, Malaysia, Pakistan and Indonesia and requests have been received by many other countries.
SLSI has noted that the demand for ‘SLS’ has been increasing and SLSI is taking every effort to cater to the increasing trend worldwide for the need for food products to be certified for quality,
Meanwhile experts in the manufacture of steels request the SLSI to check inferior steel that is being used by some manufacturers to make steel billets to manufacture steel locally.
“According to SLSI standards, a ton of steel should have 270 to 280 steel bars. However it is observers that in some cases there are about 300 steel bars clearly indicating that bars are not up to the required weight and thickness. Similarly a steel rod should be in 6 metres in length but here are instances where the length is sometimes 5.5 to 5.8 metres in length.
“These should be tested before going to construction sites. In the area of reinforcement steel, the quality is not maintained by some. The weights of the steel per ton too should be checked. There are instances where the steel rod thinness is low and even the length is shorter than the industry stipulation.”
It was also pointed out that while some steel manufacturers are adhering to strict quality controls some are acting in an irresponsible manner.
“Some even evade import tax by adopting unethical practices and this is mostly done by foreign companies based in Sri Lanka. This also happens by steel sellers who import steel from India and the SLSI should come up with a system to check this which is a major threat to the construction industry.”
SLSI was established in 1964 as the Bureau of Ceylon Standards (BCS) by an Act of Parliament to function as the National Standards Body and to provide for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto In 1969, BCS was admitted as a member of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). SLSI is a member of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) which is based in Geneva. (VW)
