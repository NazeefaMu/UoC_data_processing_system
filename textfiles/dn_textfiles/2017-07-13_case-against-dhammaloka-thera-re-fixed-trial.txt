Case against Dhammaloka Thera re-fixed for trial

The case against Ven. Uduwe Dhammaloka Thera for allegedly possessing a baby elephant without a valid licence, was yesterday re-fixed for trial on October 24 by Colombo High Court Judge Sampath Wijeratne.
Both defence and prosecution sought a further date citing that the authorities are yet to formulate a national policy regarding illegally caught wild elephants.
In January 2015, then Wildlife Deputy Minister Wasantha Senanayake had made a complaint to the Criminal Investigations Department regarding a racket where illegally caught wild elephant calves being sold to third parties. The prosecution had named the former Wildlife Deputy Minister as the first witness.
This is the first time in Sri Lanka, an accused had been indicted in the High Court by the Attorney General over an offence of possessing an elephant without valid licence following the amendments to the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance in 2009.
The Attorney General (AG) had filed an indictment against Ven. Uduwe Dhammaloka Thera on two counts for allegedly possessing a baby elephant without a licence.
The indictment has been filed over two counts come under section 22 (12) of the Fauna and Flora Protection (Amendment) Act, No.22 of 2009 and section 5(3) (a) of the Public Property Act. The Attorney General had named 19 persons as witnesses and three documents as production items in the case.
Wildlife Department officials had taken into custody a two and half year-old elephant calf which was found inside the Alan Mathiniyaramaya Temple in Polhengoda on January 28, 2015.
The Attorney General maintained that Dhammaloka Thera had illegally possessed a stolen property, a baby elephant without a valid licence, an offence comes under the Fauna and Flora Act. The Attorney General further alleged that the accused had also committed a punishable offence under the Public Property Act since he had intentionally kept a baby elephant without a licence. The Attorney General alleged that the accused had committed this offence on or around January 28, 2015 with the Colombo High Court’s jurisdiction.
Senior State Counsel Janaka Bandara appeared for the Attorney General. President’s Counsel Prasantha Lal de Alwis appeared for the accused.
