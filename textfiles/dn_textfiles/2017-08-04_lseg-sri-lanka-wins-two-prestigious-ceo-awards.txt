LSEG Sri Lanka wins two prestigious CEO Awards

CEO Award for ‘Excellence’ and CEO Award for ‘Commitment to Responsible Business’ 
The London Stock Exchange Group – Sri Lanka (LSEG SL) was feted with two prestigious awards at the recently concluded Annual LSEG CEO Awards, taking top honours in the categories for Responsible Business, and Excellence.
A cross functional team from LSEG Sri Lanka won the CEO Award for ‘Excellence’ for their exceptional contribution to generate high volume, speed, and quality to support the opening of LSEG’s new technology facility in Sri Lanka.
LSEG opened its new state-of-the-art technology facility in December 2016. Headquartered at Trace Expert City in Colombo, the new technology hub was opened by the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and LSEG Chairman, Donald Brydon. Through this new facility, LSEG will directly employ 400 personnel in high-technology jobs, with an additional 1200 employed indirectly to provide technical support services for the Group's global network.
Winning the CEO Award for ‘Commitment to Responsible Business’ was MillenniumIT’s team Mahoga for their launch of Mahoga: the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) platform.
Winner of the CEO Award for Excellence – Team Mahoga: Jayaruwan Mannapperuma, Isuru Herath, Dewmal Anicitus, Kishan Navaratne, Chris Corrado, Ishan De Silva, Shanaka Abeywickrama, Rukshan Abeyratne, Ramila Hettiarachchi (Absent in the picture: Dinu Kumarasiri, Supun Vithana, Thusara Jayasinghe)
The project was recognised for its potential to be a major force in driving charitable involvement and fundraising, embodying the Group’s corporate responsibility objectives.
Mahoga is a web platform designed to match a social investor with a beneficiary that is in need of resources and support. With a reputation for powering over 40 stock exchanges and trading venues across the world, the team took up the challenge to create a platform that could match donors with beneficiaries to achieve a long-term, sustainable impact. Through Mahoga, the LSEG SL CSR team intends to bridge the existing gaps in the corporate responsibility domain and facilitate the allocation of resources in the best way possible to drive transformative CSR projects.
This year, over 150 nominations were accepted across seven categories. They were then reviewed by a cross-business, cross-regional judging panel chaired by the Group heads of Human Resources and Communications. Judges were then selected from across LSEG's Leadership Team to ensure representation across businesses and geographies.
LSEG believes the annual CEO Awards play an important role in recognising and rewarding employees at all levels of the organisation. This year multiple category awards have been won by teams, indicating a strong culture of collaboration which has contributed to the Group’s success and helped fuel growth.
