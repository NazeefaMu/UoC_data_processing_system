SLIM urges firms to get benefit of  marketing guru Ron Kaufman

 Etching an exciting new milestone for Sri Lanka's business fraternity, the Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM) prepares to welcome the world's No 1 guru in service, Ron Kaufman, to Sri Lanka, on July 18 and 19.
With just less than one month to go, these must-attend hallmark events scheduled during Kaufman's two-day visit will focus on maximizing the role service plays in this evolutionary era of both local and global change.
Given the unprecedented demand from corporates for this event, SLIM has added on a bonus for those who wish to have exclusive one-on-ones with Kaufman.
At a media conference held on May 30 announcing the launch of this much looked forward to event, a strong message put forth by SLIM was that the 200 participants who will interact with this global service consultant, speaker, educator, thought leader and customer service exponent, will undoubtedly benefit immensely from his revolutionary yet practical tenets of service and customer leadership.
Whether it's the corporate heads who will participate at the CEO Breakfast Forum on July19 at Cinnamon Grand or HR managers, trainers and front and back office teams joining the Knowledge Forum on July 18 at Waters Edge, each will gain valuable insights and be able to penetrate deep into a service-driven culture that forms the winning formula for an organization's unequivocal success.
“I have never seen anyone present so much valuable information in such a short period of time and do it so delightfully,” said Paul Snider, Program Committee Chair of the Harvard Business School Alumni Association.
This statement rings true as Kaufman himself takes Sri Lanka through the process of building a sustainable service culture.
“I'm going to make that service culture come alive,” he says of the programs he intends to conduct in Sri Lanka.
“What's the architecture? How do you build an environment that inspires people, encourages people and enables people? When you're doing that within an organization, you need a structure with three fundamental elements; a foundation of continuous service improvement where everyone is focused on stepping up to create more value for other people."
"We need leadership behavior that gives direction and protection to everything that goes on in that corporate house and finally, there are the building blocks, twelve key areas of activity, which I will make real for you with practical examples, case studies and illustrations from all over the world.”
"SLIM President Karthik Elangovan said, “As the national body for marketing, SLIM has an integral responsibility in adding value to the nation's ambitious development agenda."
"A service leadership culture in the business sphere is what the country will be exposed to, by the world's foremost Service Guru, Ron Kaufman.” For more information, visit www.slim.lk.
