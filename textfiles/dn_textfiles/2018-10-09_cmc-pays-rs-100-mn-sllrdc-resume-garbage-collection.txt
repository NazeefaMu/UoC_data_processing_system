CMC pays Rs. 100 mn, SLLRDC to resume garbage collection

Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) made an advance payment of Rs. 100 million to the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation (SLLRDC) yesterday in order for the latter to resume garbage collection in the CMC area.
Colombo Mayor Rosy Senanayake vehemently condemned the conduct of the SLLRDC on this matter and added that there was no outstanding payment to be made.
“SLLRDC is extorting payment for garbage management,” she said. SLLRDC informed on Sunday (7) that they would temporarily quit collecting garbage in the CMC area from yesterday (8) as the CMC had failed to make an outstanding payment of Rs. 207 million to them for garbage management.
Senanayake said that the CMC was not aware how the figure mentioned by SLLRDC was computed.
“We asked the SLLRDC for a month’s time to figure this out because the letter they sent does not have any details of the outstanding payment that needs to be made,” she said.
Senanayake further mentioned that she did not like the conduct of the SLLRDC on this matter and added that the decision to make an advance payment was decided unanimously by CMC officials and council members considering the inconvenience the public might have to face as a result.
“Since September 28, official letters have been shared between the SLLRDC and the CMC, but the SLLRDC never called us for a meeting to discuss these issues. They suddenly pointed to an outstanding sum and informed us that they are going to quit collecting garbage,” she said.
Responding to a statement made by SLLRDC Chairman Roshan Gunawardena that the SLLRDC never increased the charges, that resources used were owned by SLLRDC and that the SLLRDC was managing the garbage collection since 2017, the Mayor refuted the claims and said that SLLRDC has been handling the garbage collection only from March 2018 and emphasised that it was the CMC that managed the garbage collection from 2017 to March 2018.
She pointed out that there is no outstanding payment to the SLLRDC as per CMC records.
Senanayake further said that in every letter they wrote to the SLLRDC, they clearly mentioned that if there was any dispute regarding these payments, to kindly give the CMC time until the end of October to sort out the issues.
“CMC took all efforts and settled all the payments once the invoices were received. We are yet to receive the invoice for August 2018,” she said.
Referring to the letters sent to the SLLRDC Chairman, Senanayake said that it was agreed that the payments will be made at the rate of Rs. 3,000 per MT for sorted biodegradable and perishable waste.
Senanayake asked why the SLLRDC was not taking any payment from the Kaduwela, Ja-Ela and Wattala Municipal Councils for garbage collection.
“Why are they demanding money only from the CMC?” she questioned.
She further said that the central government should find a long-term and sustainable solution to the garbage issue and added that she planned to have a discussion with the President and Prime Minister on this matter soon.
