IronOne’s BoardPAC stars at South African Conference

BoardPAC, the Sri Lanka developed breakthrough iPad-enabled board meeting automation solution, has caught the attention of leading companies in South Africa, after it was presented at the recent Corporate Governance Conference of Chartered Secretaries South Africa (CSSA) by developer IronOne Technologies, a leading Sri Lankan mobile and enterprise services software solutions provider.
BoardPAC was the only Sri Lankan product at the two-day conference held at the Wanderers Club, Johannesburg, which was attended by a distinguished audience of Directors, Company Secretaries and delegates from leading companies in South Africa. The conference provided a platform for regulatory representatives and distinguished business leaders to share their experiences in their respective areas of expertise.
“Strong corporate governance is vital in today’s business environment as it promotes transparency for investors and accountability for those in leadership positions,” IronOne Technologies Chief Operating Officer Rajitha Kuruppumulle said .
“As a trusted provider of corporate governance solutions, IronOne was delighted to be able to demonstrate how BoardPAC is the right platform for South African companies that are looking to foster a culture of good corporate governance and move to paperless board meetings.”
“We hope this marks the first of many future interactions between CSSA and BoardPAC,” said Stephen Sadie, the Association’s CEO. “The solution enables a robust corporate governance arrangement to be put in place, documented and communicated to key senior executives and board members with the aid of technological innovation.”
In South Africa, BoardPAC is supported by its partner Entelect, a leading software solutions provider, via a dedicated help desk manned by Entelect’s technical professionals, to ensure that board members using the solution will be able to navigate and access their secured documents at anytime.
In Sri Lanka, BoardPAC is the board automation solution used by leading companies including Carson Cumberbatch PLC, John Keells Holdings, Commercial Bank, Sampath Bank, Nations Trust Bank, Sri Lankan Airlines, Hemas and MAS Holdings as well as the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE).
