HUTCH introduces ATM  reloads for HNB customers

Hutch, Sri Lanka’s fastest growing mobile broadband operator recently introduced 24/7 reload service through the island wide ATMs, Cash Deposit Machines (CDM) and Kiosks network of Hatton National Bank (HNB). This is another result of the company’s ongoing bid to bring ultimate convenience to its customers.
Hutch users who bank with HNB can now top-up their mobile accounts from over 500 HNB ATM locations across the country. Not only HNB customers, any Hutch user can do the same using HNB CDM/Kiosks network using cash. Moreover, Hutch top-ups and bill payments can be made using HNB online banking. These self-service top-up mechanisms which are available 24 hours of the day is particularly useful when it difficult to access a retail outlet during nights or weekends.
