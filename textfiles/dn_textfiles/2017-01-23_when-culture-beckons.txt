When Culture Beckons

There was a tangible sense of occasion at the Punchi Theatre on Tuesday night. The audience was sprinkled with several stars. For someone who never watches TV, it was a eureka moment to be able to identify three out of the four famous television actors and actresses who were the chief guests, presenter Arun Dias Bandaranaike, Prof. Ariyarathna Kaluarachchi, Vice Chancellor, University of the Visual & Performing Arts, as well as several prominent personalities of the media. But the real sparkle came from the stage.
The event was the preview of Punchi Theatre's newest venture, ("my new pissuwa" as Namel Weeramuni describes it, but which Arun Dias Bandaranaike changed to "Namel's sweet pissuwa') - the presentation of traditional Sri Lankan dances, ranging from the Raban to Peacock to Pantheru, amazingly engaging, rich and dynamic, each accompanied by mesmerising beats of the traditional drums.
In a series of events that will commence from January 26 to be continued every Thursday, every week, in this new venture Namel and Malini Weeramuni have opened the doors of the Punchi Theater to the undergraduates of the University of Visual and Performing Arts with the sole aim of keeping the torches burning for the dying arts of our ancestors.
The handsomely crafted and grippingly dramatic dance movements on stage seen on Tuesday - while adhering strictly to the deep rooted traditions of our past - were really quite different from the conventional dances we have seen elsewhere, probably because they were not tediously too long. There were magical passages in the harvest dance, breathtaking leaps and somersaults in the Pantheru, a timely and touching opening dance, representing dances from different ethnic groups in the Pooja Narthanaya, and a particularly bewitching spell cast by the two dancers who performed the ves - enthralling the audience with half eerie, half uncanny beauty.
Tuesday evening was notable, too, for another debut.
The launch of the Punchi Theatre's website, http://www.punchitheatre.com immortalising in the digital arena "the tranquil creative establishment that offers a soothing haven to those who seek to experience and relish in the oasis of performing arts" called the "Namel Malini Punchi Theatre or the "Lair" (to quote the text from the website).
The cultural show is the first event to be listed on the website, hopefully paving the way for other such events rejuvenating the traditional arts, nurtured by the warm, enduring love of the Weeramunis for all that is good in the Sri Lankan culture. The Punchi Theatre might be small in stature, but the great contributions made by its founders, Namel and Malini Weeramuni to the local arts are too vast to be measured.
Be there at the Punchi Theatre on January 26 at 4.30pm when the young university students will take the stage again as the show opens for the public, unraveling age-old art forms with new energy, some with glowing warmth, and delicate, fluttering movements, others with spellbinding, effortless somersaults that leave the audience gasping for breath.
The programme, scheduled to be staged on every Thursday from now on, marked with rich details, is a remarkable collective effort from a group of young people in flying form.
Make use of this unique opportunity to tap your toes to the same drumbeats, to feast your eyes with the same dance movements our ancestors enjoyed countless sunsets ago. You will soon realise Namel Weeeramuni's 'craze' is really pretty sane.
