‘SP unp councillors at impasse’

Southern Provincial Council members belonging to the United National Party (UNP) are at an impasse as they have no leader to whom they could look up to, Southern Provincial Council UNP member T. V. K. Gamini said.
He was addressing the media following a UNP discussion which was held on April 24 after the inaugural meeting of the Southern Provincial Council was adjourned.
"Their opposition group leader and UNP opposition chief whip had failed to get an appointment for them to meet party leader Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe," he added.
