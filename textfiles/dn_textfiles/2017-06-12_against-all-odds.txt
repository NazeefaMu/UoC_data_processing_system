Against all odds

She has been a well known face in the television and movie industry for more than three decades. Though she does not make an appearance often in the entertainment scene it is difficult to leave Vishaka Siriwardhana out of the celebrity circles. She is mostly known for her mature and negative roles at present but according to her husband, Dharma Siriwardhana, Vishaka possesses a soft and gentle nature. A few decades back, she has defined her family and married her childhood sweetheart even after he has met with a grave accident which has resulted in amputating his right leg.
In brief
One significant feature about Vishaka is that she is really dedicated to whatever she takes up. She gives her hundred percent to any project which she is a part of. She also makes time to see about my welfare. She has won the Best Supporting Actress award at the Sarasaviya Film Awards in 1985. I think that she is one of the best among the actresses who exist in the field today.
The wife
Though she is dedicated to her career Vishaka is also very much involved in house work. We do not keep any servants because we manage the household chores between us. She can cook very well. We never buy our meals from restaurants. She knows all my favourite dishes and matches them well so that we have delicious and balanced meals on the table every day. She is a good housewife.
First meeting
That is a long story which is many decades old. We met when Vishaka was still schooling. She was getting ready for her G C E Advanced Levels. She used to stop by my shop to practice typing on my typewriter. Learning to use a typewriter was a big deal those days. We started chatting and soon grew fond of each other’s company. This led to our love affair.
Our first ‘date’ was me taking her to see the streets lit up with Vesak lanterns and décor. This happened in 1978. Then I began ‘going out with her’ by taking her to her classes or wherever she wanted to go in my jeep. Our relationship developed with time.
Breaking away from the industry
Vishaka did not act for 14 years after marriage. We lived in Katupotha in the Kurunegala district, maintaining a farm. We also had a salon, pharmacy and retail shop. Vijaya Kumaratunga was the chief guest for the opening ceremony of the shop.
She got many offers but it was only after we came to live in Kalagedihena that Vishaka decided to make a comeback. She started acting again especially because veterans like Malani Fonseka made requests for her come back into the industry and Sandamadala was a good project to associate with. She didn’t want to let that opportunity go.
Favourite character
I love the character she played in Robin Fernando’s Sura Duthiyo. She had to learn martial arts for that role. I met with the accident when shooting for that film was on. She won a special award at the Singins (OCIC) Awards for her performance.
Turning points in life
I was not keen on Vishaka becoming an actress. I was worried that she will abandon me after she becomes a star. She went for her film audition without informing me. After she was chosen to star in films I began to visit her sets and was among the crowd who had gathered to watch the shooting take place. Her mother accompanied her while she was engaged in shooting but she did not know that we were having a relationship. Then gradually as she became more established in the field my dislike of her being in the industry disappeared.
I met with an accident in 1985 which resulted with my leg being amputated. I was devastated. I told Vishaka many times to let me go because she can lead a better life without me. However she was determined to be with me. Her family got to know about our relationship and was thoroughly against it. She was not even allowed to visit me. She found a way to see me by seeking the help of a doctor and his wife who lived close by. Finally it was Vishaka who took the bold decision to marry me. We got married on September 22, 1986.
Fanatic fans
Vishaka got the opportunity to play evil characters in most of her recent works. Her role in the teledrama called Vasuda became quite popular with the fans. Once during a shooting session in Negombo she tried to take a baby from an onlooker. The mother made a fuss saying that Vishaka is evil. Finally Cletus Mendis had to intervene and save her from the mother of the child!
Other passions
Vishaka loves to sing. She is very good at singing too. She is also passionate about her salon work. She has a salon in Gampaha now. She will be shifting it to a new place in Thihariya soon.
Fears
Vishaka is scared of the dark. She is also scared of ghosts though she has yet to meet one!
Soul mates
I believe that Vishaka brought good luck into my life. She helped me ease the pain of losing my leg and has stood by me through thick and thin.

Foodwise
I love rice and curry. Vishaka does too. My ideal meal would consist of green brinjal curry, chicken and banana flower fry. She loves Jak fruit curry, bread fruit curry and tender Jak fruit curry.
Holidaying
Vishaka has to travel a bit if the shooting is scheduled out of Colombo. I accompany her if we are able to travel in our van. We recently went to Nuwara Eliya for four days. Nuwara Eliya is our ideal holiday destination because of the beauty and the cool climate.
Irritations
I get irritated if Vishaka does not do what I request her to do immediatly. If it is something that I can do then I handle it by myself. I only request her to do so because it is something that I cannot manage. Vishaka also gets irritated when I become angry. We keep well away from each other for some time then. Finally one of us goes and speaks with the other and we reconcile. Once she is back on good terms with me she feeds me well! So this is how it goes – arguments result in no food and reconciliations result in delicious meals!
Celebrities engaged in dance reality shows
Vishaka likes to watch her fellow colleagues take part singing and dancing reality shows. Those are popular these days and she thinks that they bring diversity to the industry and how the public are able to perceive artistes from a different angle. Dancing is good to maintain good health too. It has a positive impact not only in maintaining a good figure but also on mental wellbeing. I think she would not hesitate to take part in one if they invite her to do so.
Most unforgettable experience
Thieves robbed our shop during the period of youth insurgency. The thief himself was well known to us and was expressing his sorrow at length before he was caught. It is not a rosy experience but it is one that we both would never forget in our lifetime.
Present projects
Vishaka has two films which are scheduled to be released soon. They are No Mister Mama Director by Keerthi Bandara and Kusum Chandra Gamage’s unnamed production.
