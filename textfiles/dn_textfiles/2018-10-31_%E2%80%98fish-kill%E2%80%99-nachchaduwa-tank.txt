‘Fish kill’ in Nachchaduwa tank

Fish in the Nachchaduwa tank had been dying at alarming rate recently and fisherfolk in the area said that their numbers were increasing everyday.
They said that fish had started dying with the start of the monsoonal rains and also alleged that chemical waste could be running into the tank.
The fisherfolk urged authorities to investigate the matter, as well as to bring any culprits who may be behind the incident to book.
