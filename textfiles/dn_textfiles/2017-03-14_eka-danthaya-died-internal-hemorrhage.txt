Eka Danthaya died of internal hemorrhage

The postmortem on the remains of the Eka Danthaya (The Single Tusker) that participated in the procession of the Sri Dalanda Maligawa (the temple of the tooth relic) for 40 years has revealed that the tusker had died of internal hemorrhage of the intestine.
The postmortem was held for three and a half hours at the Pallekele elephant stable of the Sri Dalanda Maligawa with the participation of two veterinary surgeons of the National Zoological Department and Wildlife Department.
The tusker died on the Medin Full Moon Poya day and was buried the following day after the religious observances by the Ven Maha Sangha at the stable at Dalanda Maligawa.
The tusker had been offered to the Dalada Maligawa by Vimala Kannangara.
