Moneragala welcomes  Industrial Zone: Ranjith

The real nature of politicians who shed crocodile tears on poverty and unemployment among youths came to light with the Hambantota incident that attempted to disrupt the development programme there, Public Administration and Management Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara said.
The minister told at a meeting in Bibile that if politicians and people in Hambantota do not need the industrial zone, the people in Moneragala were ready to obtain it by offering 20,000 acres instead of the 15,000 acres.
"The Moneragala district is of the most underdeveloped areas from time immemorial," Bandara said. "None of the two parties which ruled the country after independence paid any attention to this area. We are ready obtain the projects on behalf of the youths and the future generations of the area".
He said massive development projects have been initiated to solve unemployment and economic draw backs.
"Some elements who are concerned of power are misleading the people against the government's projects," Minister Bandara said. "Due to this, only the people in Hambantota and Moneragala would be deprived of their opportunities".
