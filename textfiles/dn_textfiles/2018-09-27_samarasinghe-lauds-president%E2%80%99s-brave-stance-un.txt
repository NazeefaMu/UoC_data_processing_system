Samarasinghe lauds President’s brave stance at UN

Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Media Spokesman and Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said yesterday that all Sri Lankans should be proud of the brave stance taken by President Maithripala Sirisena during his speech at the 73rd Session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Tuesday.
The President has categorically said that Sri Lankan people can solve their problems on their own without foreign interference. He urged the international community to allow Sri Lankan people to solve their problems on their own without any foreign power exerting influence on them as Sri Lanka is an independent country.
He said that Sri Lankans suffered a lot as a result of the 30-year-long war and the people of the country know better of its cruelty and brutality. Therefore, the people of the country should be allowed to solve their own problems and move towards reconciliation.
The President’s reply is also the correct reply to allegations made by certain parties that the present government has betrayed the Security Forces. The President has clearly spoken on behalf of our Security Forces and he thanked our brave Security Forces personnel who sacrificed their lives and limbs for the freedom we enjoy today, Minister Samarasinghe said.
The President also categorically stated that the government is committed to working tirelessly to achieve reconciliation by fostering understanding among all ethnic and religious groups while eliminating mutual suspicion and hatred in order to create a society where all can live freely and harmoniously, the Minister said.
The President had been vested with more powers than any other leader in the world under the Executive Presidency. But he had curtailed the excessive powers of the Executive Presidency and transferred those powers to the Parliament. We have been able to pass the 19th Amendment due to the tremendous support and commitment of the President. He was personally involved in obtaining SLFP members’ support as there were only 47 UNP members in Parliament when the Amendment was passed, Minister Samarasinghe said.
