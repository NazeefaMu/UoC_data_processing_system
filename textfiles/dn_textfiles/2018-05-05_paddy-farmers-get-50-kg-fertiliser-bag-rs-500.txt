Paddy farmers to get 50 kg fertiliser bag at Rs 500

Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera yesterday instructed Colombo Commercial Fertilizers Limited and Lak Pohora to release their stocks to the market without delay.
This instruction was given at a meeting held yesterday at the Ministry, following complaints received from farmers in various parts of the country regarding the non-delivery of subsidized fertilizer. The government has already taken measures to provide subsidized fertilizer to farmers under the re-implemented fertilizer subsidy programme.
Under this programme, a 50kg bag of fertilizer will be sold to paddy farmers at Rs 500 and the fertilizer will be issued through Agrarian Services Centres.A bag of fertilizer for farmers who grow other crops will be sold at Rs.1500.
