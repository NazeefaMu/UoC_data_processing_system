Hellmann and MAS establish “Hellmann MAS Supply Chain Ltd” as new JV

Hellmann Worldwide Logistics (HWL) and MAS Holdings establish the joint venture “Hellmann MAS Supply Chain (HMSC)” in Sri Lanka by combining Hellmann´s existing contract logistics business in Sri Lanka and in-house logistics activities of MAS.
With the formation of the new JV, the existing HWL business in Sri Lanka transitions into a focused air and sea unit, whilst the new JV will provide contract logistics and Fourth Party Logistics (4PL) services in Sri Lanka.
In addition to the existing Hellmann contract logistics business in Sri Lanka being transferred to the new joint venture, a new fashion logistics facility will be opened at the MAS compound in Katunayake Export Promotion Zone (KEPZ). It is the vision of HMSC to create a pull model supply chain using Sri Lanka as the hub for major global fashion brands, help produce market specific products by offering value-added services and facilitate an e-commerce channel from the source.
HSMC will also manage the procurement and coordination of MAS’ incoming air freight.
HMSC will provide its services to MAS as well as Hellmann’s existing contract logistics customers. Services offered by HMSC, which include warehousing, value added services such as re-packing, labeling, ratio packing etc. and 4PL logistics services, will also be offered to other potential customers in Sri Lanka.
Madhav Kurup, CEO for Hellmann Middle East & South Asia (MESA): “This joint venture is a clear example of two family owned companies with similar DNA coming together to create a unique expertise in Sri Lanka that will have the ability to provide services of the highest standards in contract logistics and 4PL. This venture further helps us position ourselves as the market trend setter in the global fashion supply chain, as it evolves from a push model to pull model. MAS’ well established credibility with Hellmann’s global logistics expertise, systems and processes will make us invincible in the market place.”
Shirendra Lawrence, COO of MAS stated: “ This strategic partnership with global logistics partner Hellmann is timely as it gives MAS a strong foundation to offer warehousing, value added services and 4th party logistics solutions. Hence, it gives us the opportunity to further enhance our agility and speed to market.”
Since its foundation in 1871, Hellmann Worldwide Logistics has developed into one of the largest international logistics providers. The company is represented by a worldwide network of 19,500 people in 437 branches in 162 countries.
In 1987, Mahesh, Ajay and Sharad Amalean introduced lingerie manufacturing to South Asia and there began the MAS legacy.
Today, MAS manages a portfolio of businesses with a revenue of USD 1.75bn and is positioned as one of the world’s most recognized design to delivery solution providers in the realm of apparel and textiles.
