Shortage of officers at NWP Irrigation Department

Most village tanks in the country are situated in Kurunegala and Puttalam Districts of the North Western Province. However, only 14 technical officers are available with the Department of Irrigation for the supervision of the tanks.
At least about 50 technical officers are required to supervise village tanks, to ensure the safety of forest reserves and to stop unauthorized constructions in and around irrigation systems in the province.
Illegal activities are on the rise nowadays due to the lack of officials at the Irrigation Department.
If the government fails to appoint enough technical officers, the entire population in the province would be affected due to deforestation and vandalism caused by selfish elements, said NWP Irrigation Department Director Malkanthi Thalgodapitiya.
