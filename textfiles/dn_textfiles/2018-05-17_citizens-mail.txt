Citizens' Mail

Expedite political solution for the North and East people
Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe has recently said in a public meeting that President Maithripala Sirisena is dedicated for a political solution to the ethnic problem in the country. It is truly a fact because President Sirisena came to power as the president by giving a strong pledge to the people that his Government would precisely find a solution for the North East conflict which plunged the country into destructive war for more than 30 years.
Although the conflict was political, it was ended with a military solution, still depriving the legitimate rights of the minority Tamil people. The Northern and Eastern provinces were liberated from the clutches of terrorism but the problems caused for the conflict was still unresolved.
The people of the Northern and Eastern provinces kept an unsparing belief on President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and voted totally for them to form a government of anticipating relief for their sufferings.
Their immediate demands were releasing the lands which are under the possession of the Sri Lanka Army, methodical withdrawal of certain Army camps and finding the whereabouts of the missing persons during the time of the war.
Even in the recent speech of the Opposition Leader R Sampanthan in parliament emphasized the Tamil people do not stand for a division of the country but they claim their legitimate rights to live in peace with other communities. He said in his adjournment debate that the political, social and the cultural rights of the Tamil people must be ensured by the Government. At this pretext we all can presume, the Opposition Leader R Sampanthan’s assertion was legitimate and what they want their basic rights to be given.
At this amiable scenario it is appropriate for the Government to accelerate the reconciliation process to find a political solution to the existing ethnic conflict rather than dragging on it by blabbering on unimportant matters!
