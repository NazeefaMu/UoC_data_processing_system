Accepted post at a time of deep crisis - PM Mahinda

Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa said he accepted the invitation to take up the post of Prime Minister at a time when the country is in deep crisis because he is always prepared to perform his duties by the country and nation. He said he will confirm the confidence placed on him by saving the country from the crisis situation and steering it on the correct path. Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa gave the assurance before the Malwatte Chief Prelate Most.Ven.Thibbotuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Thera and the Asgiriya Chief Prelate Most Ven. Warakagoda Sri Gnanarathana Mahanayake Thera and members of the Karaka Sangha Sabhas in Kandy and receiving their blessings yesterday (October 28).
Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa who said that he commanded the majority support in Parliament added he would have never accepted the new post without the majority support in Parliament. He said President Maithripala Sirisena has appointed him as Prime Minister in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.
“The procedure to be adopted in removing an incumbent Prime Minister and appointing a new Prime Minister in his place in clearly laid down in the Constitution.
On this occasion, President Sirisena had made a grave and important decision. A President would never act in an irresponsible manner in making such an important decision. As such President Sirisena had made the decision with clear understanding and responsibility.
Premier Rajapaksa said President Sirisena had made the decision after firmly establishing that it would gain the support of over 120 Parliamentarians. The person who has the majority support would be proved at the next Parliamentary sitting,” Prime Minister Rajapaksa said.
The Prime Minister who said that the MoU between the two parties gets annulled the moment the UPFA withdraws from the National Government added that the Cabinet of Ministers too stands abolished the movement that happened.
As such his appointment as the new Prime Minister was legal and in keeping with the provisions, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa said, when he was the President, he relinquished all posts and left for his residence after handing over Temple Trees and all other privileges even before the announcement of the final election results. But there were no sings of Ranil leaving Temple Trees. It was regrettable to see Ranil Wickremesinghe insisting to be the Prime Minister when a new Prime Minister has been appointed according to the Constitution.
“When the economy was cashing on one side the former government went on a spree selling all local resources to foreign countries,” the Premier said.
Parliamentrian Keheliya Rambukwella, Lohan Ratwatte, Dilum Amunugama, Mahindananda Aluthgamage, Pavithra Wanni Arachchi, Anrradha Jayaratne and Lakshman Vasantha were also present on the occasion.
