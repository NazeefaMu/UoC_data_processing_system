Sunday dhamma education for schoolchildren to be made compulsory

Provincial Chief Ministers have unanimously agreed to make Sunday Dhamma School education compulsory for schoolchildren as future citizens should be well-equipped with noble human values.
The Ministers have informed their consent to President Maithripala Sirisena over the decision.
Buddhasana and Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe has planned to introduce rules and regulations to ban private tuition classes on Full Moon Poya days and Sundays till 2.00 p.m. for schoolchildren to study dhamma at Sunday Dhamma schools . Since noble human values are disappearing fast, early attention should be paid and possible steps should be taken to foster students towards noble religious teachings of the founders of religions.
Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe has held several rounds of talks with leading tuition masters countrywide to discuss the matter.
