UC chairman, 7 others re-remanded for kidnapping girl

Talawakelle-Lindula Urban Council Chairman Asoka Sepala and seven other suspects were ordered to be re-remanded till June 18, by the Nuwara Eliya district court yesterday, in connection with the kidnapping of a five-year-old girl.
Sepala had contested the recent Local Government election as an Independent Group candidate under the ‘watch’ sign.
Nuwara Eliya Police had recently arrested the Chairman and another Urban Councillor in connection with the kidnapping. The suspects are charged with the kidnapping of the girl from the Portmore Estate in Agarapathana, in 2017.
The arrests were made based on a complaint received by the Nuwara Eliya Police.
According to Police sources, the mother of the abducted child had been forcibly held by the suspects, preventing her from lodging the entry. However, she had managed to escape from their custody and had lodged an entry with the Nuwara Eliya Police.
The child, who had been sold, had been located in the Galle area.
