Patana residents protest against garbage dumping

Residents of Patana town and its suburbs staged a picketing near the Patana Isipatanaramaya Buddhist temple on Thursday, against the dumping of garbage at Patana.
The residents said garbage causes flies and dengue mosquitoes to spread.
The Nuwara Eliya Pradeshiya Sabha built a garbage recycling plant in the Patana Colony close to Patana town and started dumping garbage collected from Kotagala, Patana and Bogahawatte bazaar.
Tons of garbage collected from the Hatton-Dickoya Urban Council are also being diverted to Patana daily, making the Patana village a breeding ground for flies and dengue mosquitoes. The flies and mosquitoes have stormed into houses, hotels and shops at Patana.
