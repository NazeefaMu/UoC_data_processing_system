“Pygmalion” a play by George Bernard Shaw revolves around a Victorian professor who makes a bet that he can teach a Cockney flower girl to speak proper English and pass her off as a duchess at an ambassador’s garden party. The ensuing antics at the language classes makes for a hilarious comedy but also serves as a parody of what British society was at the time.
