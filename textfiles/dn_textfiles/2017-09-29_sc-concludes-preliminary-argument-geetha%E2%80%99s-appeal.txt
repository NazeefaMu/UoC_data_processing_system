SC concludes preliminary argument on Geetha’s appeal

The Supreme Court’s five-judge-bench headed by Chief Justice Priyasath Dep yesterday concluded preliminary arguments put forward in support and against the appeal filed by Galle district parliamentarian Geetha Kumarasinghe over her dual citizenship issue.
The Counsel appearing on behalf of Geetha Kumarasinghe sought a further date to make reply to the respondent parties. Accordingly, the appeal was fixed for October 3 for further reply and parties were directed to file their written submissions before October 9.
The Supreme Court five-judge-bench comprised Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, Justice Buwaneka Aluwihare, Justice Sisira de Abrew, Justice Anil Goonaratne, and Justice Nalin Perera.
On a previous occasion, the Supreme Court allowed former Minister Piyasena Gamage to intervene in the appeal filed by Geetha Kumarasinghe.
Delivering its judgement on the writ petition filed by five residents of Galle district, the Court of Appeal on March 3 held that in terms of Article 91(1) (d) (xiii) of the constitution, Geetha Kumarasinghe is not qualified to be elected as a Member of Parliament since she holds dual citizenship in Switzerland and Sri Lanka.
Subsequently, MP Geetha Kumarasinghe filed an Appeal in the Supreme Court challenging the Court of Appeal judgement. On May 15, a divided three-judge-Supreme Court bench had granted special leave to appeal with the petition filed by Kumarasinghe.
In his petition, former MP Piyasena Gamage observed that Interim order granted to Geetha Kumarasinghe should be set aside or vacate as the intervenient petition had not been named as a respondent. The Chief Justice had nominated a fuller bench comprising five judges of the Supreme Court to hear an appeal filed by Kumarasinghe.
In this petition, Geetha Kumarasinghe had cited N.W.E. Buwaneka of Beddegama, J.K. Amarawardhana of Yatalamatta, A.C. Gunasekara of Unawatuna, J.K. Wijesinghe of Ambalangoda and H.L.Prasanna Deepthilal of Galle, Controller General of Immigration and Emigration, the Secretary General of Parliament and several others as respondents. President’s Counsel Romesh de Silva with counsel Sugath Caldera appeared for MP Geetha Kumarasinghe. President’s Counsel J. C. Weliamuna PC, Chandaka Jayasundara PC and Pulasthi Rupasinghe appeared on behalf of the respondents. Senior State Counsel Suren Gnanaraj appeared for the Secretary General of Parliament and Controller of Immigration and Emigration.
Counsel Suren Fernando appeared for intervenient petitioner.
