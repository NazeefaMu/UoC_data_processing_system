KDCA to have the AGM after 4 years?
The talk of the town is about two rivals who supported two different factions at the Sri Lanka Cricket AGM, have now got together and are being forced to hold the AGM. The last AGM was held in February 2013. According to the KDCA Secretary the former Sports Minister had brought in a ruling that there was no need to have AGMs every year. Normally the District AGM's are held before the controlling body's AGM. At present there are no domestic tournaments for clubs in Kandy. The game is not promoted in a proper manner. It seems that KDCA wakes up only when there is an international cricket match at Pallekelle Stadium.

Ryde Gold Medal winner Rayan Weerakoon
The highest award at Trinity College the Ryde Gold Medal which is presented to the best all-round student of the school, was awarded to Boxing Lion and Rugby coloursman Rayan Weerakoon.
The award was presented at the school prize giving by chief guest Minister Faizal Mustapha. The Ryde Gold Medal is awarded each year to the best all-round senior student at Trinity College, Kandy. The Ryde Gold Medal is the highest honor that the School can bestow. It is awarded on the result of a secret ballot conducted among the senior boys (Grade 11-14) and the staff whose votes, together with that of the Principal, each count as one.
While this system makes deadlock possible, it is only on four occasions that the Medal has not been awarded as a result of the three votes going to three different people. The Medal cannot be won more than once. The Ryde Gold Medal was first presented in 1908 to John Andrew, but he was not the first boy in the history of the school to be adjudged the best all-rounder. Historical records show that such a prize has been awarded as early as 1894. The Ryde Gold Medal is named after Rev. R. W. Ryde, a former principal of Trinity (1900-1902).
