PHSA initiates kidney-disease identification programme

The Provincial Health Service Authority (PHSA) has embarked on a programme to identify persons in the North Central Province (NCP) who are unknowingly prey to kidney diseases. It is learnt that the number of kidney patients in the province is exceeding 19,000 at present. In this background, mobile blood testing units are being detailed to travel from village to village for blood-testing purposes at MOH divisions,
Dr. Palitha Bandara of the PHSA told the Daily News.
In the meantime, according to the hospital sources, dialysis treatment facilities are available only at a number of limited hospitals including the Polonnaruwa and Anuradhapura main hospitals and at Hingurakgoda, Medirigiriya, Thambuttegama, Padaviya, Kebithigollewa and Medawachchiya hospitals. There are 14 dialysis machines at Polonnaruwa and 28 at Anuradhapura teaching hospital.
The number of machines available at other 6 hospitals are altogether 31 only. The burning problem is not the machines, but the dearth of trained staff to serve in the units.
“I need minimum of 20 well-trained doctors and 45 nursing staff further to run the dialysis units in full swing. Due to the scarcity of trained staff, the dialysis service is becoming slow and inefficient, thus endangering the life of the CKDu patients,” Dr. Palitha Bandara said.
It is learnt that there are 284 CKDu patients registered for dialysis treatment at the Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital and 140 at the Polonnaruwa General Hospital. In addition, it is believed that there are about 300 CKDu patients who need to be given dialysis treatment that have not been registered. A CKDu patient needs dialysis for three times per month and the government spends nearly Rs. 30,000 per one patient per month.
Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne, referring to the issue, told the Daily News that it has been proposed to appoint nursing assistants after one year of training in dialysis treatment and attach them to the dialysis units at the hospitals under the supervision of senior trained nurses. There are 31,000 nurses attached to our hospitals at present and we need another 6,000 - 10,000 trained nurses soon. There are only 450 dialysis machines in operation at present in the hospitals. It will be increased up to 1,000 by the end of the year. Another 900 machines will come from India. It should be mentioned that there were only 150 dialysis machines when we came in to power. However, steps will be taken to strengthen the dialysis treatment service in NCP in view of the fast-spreading kidney disease menace in the zone, the minister added.
