Lucas Matthysse vows fight  ‘to the death’ against Pacquiao

Manila: World champion Lucas Matthysse on Wednesday vowed a fight "to the death" in his July title defence against Manny Pacquiao, calling the Philippine boxing star "past his prime".
But the 35-year-old Argentine -- who took the vacant World Boxing Association welterweight title in January -- said it was still a "dream-come-true" and "an honour" to face Pacquiao, winner of eight unprecedented world titles in different weight classes.
"Obviously he is still a very great fighter but since the knockout of Marquez, I think he is not the same fighter anymore," Matthysse said at a joint news conference in Manila, referring to the Filipino's sensational 2012 knockout loss to Juan Manuel Marquez.
Pacquiao, 39, will fight Matthysse for the WBA welterweight belt on July 15 in Malaysia's capital Kuala Lumpur. AFP
