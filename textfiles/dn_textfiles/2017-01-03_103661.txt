Vasudeva files against China land lease

 
Opposition MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara has filed a petition in the Supreme Court challenging the government’s decision to lease land in Hambantota for a period of 99-years, to China.
The Sri Lanka government is set to sign the lease on January 8, in a debt-for-equity swap that will remove as much USD 1 million debt Sri Lanka owes China.
