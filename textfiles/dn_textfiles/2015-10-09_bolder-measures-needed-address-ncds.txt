'Bolder measures needed to address NCDs'

Bolder measures need to be taken to address Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs) if Sri Lanka intends to meet the target to reduce premature mortality by 33 percent in 2030, said Senior Adviser, WHO Headquarters Geneva, Dr. Nick Banatvala.
Addressing the media in Colombo yesterday, Dr. Banatvala said to ensure that the UN agencies in Sri Lanka extend their support for the national NCD response in a coordinated manner, the UN Task force is recommending that the UN agencies in Sri Lanka establish UN Thematic Group on NCDs under the leadership of the World Health Organisation (WHO).
The joint mission discussed the draft National Multisectoral Action plan for prevention and control of NCDs 2016 - 2020, which sets out a plan for all parts of the government to work together with development partners to combat the NCD epidemic, he said.
NCDs have become a serious economic as well as public health issue in Sri Lanka, said Health Ministry Non Communicable Diseases Director Dr. Thilak Siriwardena.
"It is fueled by tobacco use, unhealthy diet, harmful use of alcohol and physical inactivity," he said.
Dr. Siriwardena said that in 2012, 75 percent of deaths in Sri Lanka were due to NCDs.
The four main diseases were cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes mellitus and Chronic respiratory diseases, he said.
Sri Lanka is the second country in the WHO South-East Asia Region to host a Joint Mission of the Task Force, said WHO in Sri Lanka representative Dr. Jacob Kumaresan.
Dr. Kumaresan said that if affordable evidence based policies like raising tax on tobacco, banning all forms of tobacco advertising, restricting or banning alcohol advertising, preventing heart attack or strokes, promoting breast feeding, implementing public health awareness programmes on diet and physical activity and preventing cancer through screening are implemented, it could result in dramatic reduction in NCDs over a short period.
The World Bank is engaged with the government in a USD 200 million operation to upgrade the standard of performance of the public health system, said World Bank Senior Health Specialist Dr. Kumari Vinodhani Navaratne.
She added that NCDs are a burden on Sri Lanka's growth.
The mission will enable Sri Lanka to respond well to the challenges of malnutrition and NCDs, Dr. Navaratne said.
A joint mission of United Nations Inter agency Task Force on the Prevention and Control of NCDs agreed to support the government in tackling NCDs.
The mission included representatives from the International Organization of Migration (IOM), International Labour Organization (ILO), Joint united Nations programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), United Nations Educational, scientific and cultural organization (UNESCO), United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF), UN Volunteers (UNV), World food programme (WFP), World Bank and the World Health Organization (WHO).
