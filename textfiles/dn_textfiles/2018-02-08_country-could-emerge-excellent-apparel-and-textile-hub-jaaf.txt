Country could emerge as excellent apparel and textile hub - JAAF

Apparel manufacturers must complement and cooperate, rather than competing with each other to achieve desired industry targets.
These views were expressed by Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association Senior Vice President Faruque Hassan yesterday speaking at the inauguration of International Conference on the Apparel industry, held under the theme ‘Productivity Development, Disruptive innovation and Leadership’.
The three- day event is being organized by Monash Business School, Monash University.
“Asia is emerging as major apparel and clothing hub. I think we shouldn’t compete with each other. But we need to complement and cooperate with each other. We are still living in the age of price cuts. But the respect has to be given to fair pricing.”
Asia is emerging as a global textile and clothing hub; In 2000 Asia’s share of textile was 44.92%.
In 2014, global apparel exports were at US $ 483 billion; in 2015, it reduced to US $ 445 billion dollars, indicating a drop of 7.88%. In 2016, apparel industry once again recorded a negative growth globally.
Globally 60 million people are employed in the apparel industry including 15 million women workers, in factories located in Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.
Hassan also noted that whole value chain of the industry has to be looked at in terms of safely, well-being and dignity and also stressed the need to take measures to improve industrial relations, skills, goals, productivity and innovation. Bangladesh is the second largest apparel exporter in the world after china and accounts for 6.5% market share globally. Joint Apparel Association Forum (JAAF) Deputy Chairman Saifuddin Jafferjee speaking at the event said that Sri Lanka could emerge as an excellent apparel and textile hub given its strategic location and existing knowledge base.
“Sri Lanka could be a hub where we could develop new models, new opportunities that we can grow in the future.”
According to Jafferjee , the productivity improvement, disruptive innovation, effective leadership, sustainability and ethical production have become key concerns not only for manufactures and their major global customers but also for other stakeholders involved with apparel industry including government and etc..
Sri Lanka apparel industry has evolved to a world class manufacturer reaching; an export turnover of US $ 4.7 billion. During the last quarter, industry has registered a 10% growth rate.
During its evolution from a quota driven basic manufacturing era, the industry transitioned into sourcing management and thereafter advanced to supply chain management.
“We see that globally manufacturing per say is now yielding the lowest value addition in the total supply chain; and therefore front end services such as innovation, product design and development, marketing, logistics and speed will be differentiators for the industry to focus on in the future.
Presently, Sri Lanka is aspiring to become a total solution provider from innovation to delivery.
