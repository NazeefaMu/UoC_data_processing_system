SL wins Popular Destination Award at GITF Travel Fair in Guangzhou

The Consulate General of Sri Lanka in Guangzhou in partnership with the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau participated in the Guangzhou International Travel Fair (GITF) from 23rd – 25th February 2017 in Guangzhou. A group of 19 Travel & tour agents from Sri Lanka participated in the Travel Fair and a seven member dance troupe from the Rivega Dance Studio performed traditional dances at the Sri Lanka pavilion.
The GITF is South China’s leading travel Expo drawing affluent travel enthusiasts every year from mainland China. The volume of visitors to this event has been increasing annually and this has enabled Sri Lanka to gain greater exposure and visibility for its unique destination brand.
One of the highlights for Sri Lanka was winning the “Most Popular Tourism Destination Award“ at the Awards night. This is the second consecutive year Sri Lanka has won this award and is testament to the country’s growing popularity among Chinese travel enthusiasts. China has been Sri Lanka’s second largest source market for tourism since 2014.
