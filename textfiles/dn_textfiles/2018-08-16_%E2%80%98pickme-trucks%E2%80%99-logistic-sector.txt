‘PickMe Trucks’ for logistic sector

One of Sri Lanka’s most innovative taxi service PickMe has recently rolled out their latest service offering ‘PickMe Trucks’ through their smartphone app.
The new service will now make the transportation of heavy goods on–demand, much more convenient safer and affordable for individuals and businesses in Sri Lanka, with the feature being available at the tip of their finger.
The latest addition to PickMe’s growing vehicle fleet comes in two categories— Light and Mover. Lightweight models including ‘Dimo Batta’, ‘Dimo Lokka’, ‘Yunimo Lokka’, ‘Tata Batta’, ‘Mahindra Maxximo’, ‘Tata super ACE’ and Bolero. Truck models in the ‘Mover’ category are Foton, Isuzu and Mazda. Patrons who wish to use the feature need to only launch the PickMe app on their mobile phones and select the option ‘Trucks’ and thereafter the process would be similar to booking a taxi. Commenting on their latest development, PickMe Chief Executive Officer Zulfer Jiffry said, “I am extremely pleased to introduce our newest service ‘PickMe trucks’ to every Sri Lankan. The unique service offered through a smartphone app in Sri Lanka will not only elevate PickMe’s current offering level but also enhance the standard levels of Sri Lanka’s transportation industry.”
“The commitment to finding solutions for the Sri Lankan transportation problems requires translating our vision into a solution that works for all Sri Lankans,” said PickMe Chief Operating Officer Isira Perera.
The PickMe app, which has been downloaded by more than one million Sri Lankans, promoted accountability from the part of the drivers through the usage of a live taximeter. As the Company reaches its milestone 3rd year of success, PickMe has today become a well-established, brand name in islandwide.
