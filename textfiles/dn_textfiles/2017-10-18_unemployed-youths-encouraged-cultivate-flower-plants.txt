Unemployed youths encouraged to cultivate flower plants

Sustainable Development and Wildlife Deputy Minister Sumeda Jayasena said people at Wellawaya and suburbs were earning a good income by cultivating rose flower plants and asked youths who attempt to earn additional income to engage in the venture.
She said the country would have to import rose flowers from India if the plant was not grown here. A rose flower can be sold at Rs. 35 to 40 and it enjoys a big demand in foreign countries, the Deputy Minister said.
She said the Department of National Botanical Gardens launched a programme to encourage the flower plant cultivator and Wellawaya will be a hub for the programme. "Another was launched in the Moneragala district and cultivators would be provided with flowerpots and other necessities to improve their income," she said.
The Deputy Minister said the jobless youth could be self-employed in flower plant cultivation without being a burden to their elders. She said 3,500 flower plant cultivators were registered, but the country has about 6,500 unregistered flower plant cultivators. She said new technology would be introduced to flower plant cultivators.
She said Sri Lanka earned US dollar 13.6 in 2016 by exporting flowers.
