First ever Sri Lanka Army Women’s Corps symposium:
Timely venture to further empower women - Army Commander

The Sri Lanka Army Women’s Corps (SLAWC) first ever symposium on the theme ‘Women: the Bedrock of Peace and Sustainable Development’ took place at the BMICH yesterday, with President Maithripala Sirisena gracing the occasion as the Chief Guest.
With the majority of the country’s population consisting of women, it is inevitable that women take the lead in all forms of development in the future.
This Symposium served as a platform for learning and interacting as women’s participation in leading decision-making roles since they are also still under represented in our society.
The first ever Symposium of this nature organized by the SLAWC was held under various appropriate topics.
The symposium focused mainly on women’s contribution to society not just as caregivers in the family, but also women’s participation in today’s society in the role of contributors to the family’s economy and as decision makers at national and international level.
The seminar was held under four main tops and six sub-topics mainly on the role of women of the armed forces promoting ethnic harmony and peace keeping, nation building through women empowerment, the emerging role of women as a catalyst of development and sustainable peace, impact of women participation in decision making for sustainable peace etc.
Addressing the gathering, the Army Commander Lt. Gen. Mahesh Senanayake said present day women have surpassed the traditional roles given by the patriarchy society and embarked on the social, economic and political fields to provide active support and contribution to the family first, to the workplace next and the community at large in a broader sphere.
“Women, globally and locally have risen to greatness and power by entering into the different spheres like nursing, teaching, management, police, defence, sports, space exploration, social work and many other fields and increasing their influence in the decision-making process.”
In such a context, he said as the Army Commander, he believes that initiating ‘Sri Lanka Army Women’s Symposium’ is a timely venture to further empower women with a vision.
The Symposium is aimed at bringing women leaders into the conversation and creating an engaged platform with women to highlight the role of women in achieving sustainable peace and development.
“In Sri Lanka, women are still under-represented in managerial, decision making and leadership positions though there is significant presence of women in the peace building and reconciliation agenda.
Women in the peace building process need to be further empowered to enhance their representation at various levels of decision making, activism and advocacy.
The Sri Lanka Army paved the way for generations of young women to serve the motherland by founding the Sri Lanka Army Women’s Corps in the year 1979 with its motto ‘Powerful Mind is the Strongest Weapon’,” he added.
