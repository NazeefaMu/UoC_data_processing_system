Royal rockets to Guinness World Records: Shooting to glory!

On November 10, 2017 Royal College set a new world record for the most number of water rockets released simultaneously in a time span of five seconds. The former record of 1056 rockets which was achieved by the students at Shap Pat Heung Rural Committee Kung Yik She Secondary School in China, in 2013 was surpassed by the students of Royal College who launched 1950 water rockets.
The feat was proposed by the Astronomical Society of Royal College in celebration of the 50th anniversary of the club and involved the participation of 2000 students from Grades 6 to10. Of the 2000, 1950 rockets were launched successfully at the Royal College Rugby Complex, clearing the 10 percent error allowance of 1800 and rocketing Royal into the Guinness World Records.
The Guinness World Record was presented by the Astronomical Society of Royal College to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on January 19 at the BMICH.
“Disce Aut Discede”
In an interview with the Daily News, Royal College Principal B A Abeyrathna briefly explained the journey towards securing the Guinness World Record. A task that left many feeling wary owing to the significant probability of failure and the fear of it amounting to a waste of time, it did not deter the young boys from striving to achieve their goal. Keeping with the motto of the school, he emphasized the power of education above all else.
Motivated by the Senior Deputy Principal, these boys proved that education was the key to success as they applied their theoretical knowledge to the practical task of constructing the water rockets. The process required great perseverance and discipline. Assistance was obtained from the army and the air force who aided in the process of constructing the launchers and supervision of the 2000 boys who participated.
A vision becomes a reality
The Senior Games Master of Royal College, M A M Riyaz, was filled with joy about the success of the young Royalists whose vision to beat China had become a reality. With regard to the previous record set by China he said, “Our boys wanted to beat that and so embarked on this journey.”
Although the journey was long and tedious he was filled with humble gratitude to all those who had contributed to achieving this prestigious record including, the Principal, Senior Deputy Principal, the Ministry of Education, the teachers-in-charge including. B R Chanditha, the sectional heads, the army and air force, the Physical Training Inspectors (PTIs) including Jaaliya, the Arthur C. Clark Institute for Modern Technologies, the sponsors, teachers, parents and the innovative group from the Astronomical Club.
Success in Unity
The teacher-in-charge of the Astronomical Society who was a source of strength to the boys behind this feat was B. R. Chanditha. Commenting to the Daily News, he spoke of the demanding nature of the journey that the boys had ventured on. The training and the discipline that went into the success of the project was not easily achieved. The varying ages of the students who participated resulted in difficulty in ensuring that the students stayed in one place. He recounted how the youngsters would grow tired from having to sit still and would take to running around the Rugby Complex.
He mentioned the many tasks that had to be accomplished before the final launching of the water rockets. These included obtaining sponsors as in spite of attempts to keep costs to a minimum, funds were necessary to facilitate the mechanisms used for the launch. Sponsors included Arpico, Elephant House, Sri Lanka Telecom and the Lottery Board. He also detailed the complications that were faced when selecting the best mechanism for the launch and the trial and error process of selecting the most feasible strategy for the launch. All this had to be done while keeping with the guidelines set by the Guinness World Records committee.
A Herculean task
The team from the Astronomical Society that were behind this record-breaking feat were Yuneth Wijenayake (Secretary, 2018), Maneth Senavirathna (Chairman, 2017), Mahen Abeyrathna (Secretary, 2017) and Dheeshaan Booso (Assistant Secretary, 2017).
The Arthur C. Clarke Institute for Modern Technologies (ACCIMT) popularized water rockets in 2005, by conducting a workshop on making water boosted rockets followed by a national water boost rocket competition which was held since 2005.
Since then, ACCIMT has been providing opportunities to the Sri Lankan school students to participating in the international water rocket competition organized by the Asia Pacific Regional Space Agency Forum.

In 2015, the Sri Lankan water rocket team consisting of six students and two teachers participated in the APRSAF water rocket competition which was jointly organized by the National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN) in Indonesia and APRSAF in Bali, Indonesia. Yuneth Wijenayake of the Astronomical Society of Royal College Colombo won second place in this event.
Wijenayake explained the three part preparation process that went into securing their spot in the Guinness World Records. After getting permission from the principal, the three part process was involved selecting a feasible mechanism, organizing the students who took part and contacting the Guinness World Record committee.
The initial task was to zero in on a simple, low cost mechanism for the construction of the water rockets. Having commenced their task 2 to 3 months before the “launch date”, they worked around the clock, testing each method that they thought appropriate. They finally settled on individual launchers, keeping in accord with the guidelines of the Guinness World Records committee, which consisted of a pump attached to a re-used carbonated drinks mega bottle. The creation of 2000 such contraptions was no easy task, as each mechanism had to be tested individually to ensure that there were no pressure leaks as the room for error allocated was a mere 10 percent. Exceeding this would result in their immediate disqualification.
Maneth Senavirathna explained how they managed to get the students organized and prepared for the launch. As the structure and functions of the water rocket were listed in the Science textbooks, a majority of the students who participated from Grades 6 to10 were well versed in the requirements of the task. Nevertheless, the whole process was practiced on five days to ensure that performance was smooth on the day of the launch. After focusing and deciding on a suitable process, keeping in line with the school procedure and the Guinness guidelines, they began to prepare the students. Special permission was obtained from grade heads and teachers-in-charge in advance and with the support of the school, they were able to execute their plan. Permission from parents were readily given as they supported their sons, especially the Astronomical Society, to the extent that even late/overnight work was not restricted.
While all this appears to have been quite the challenge, the team agreed that their greatest obstacle was communicating with and keeping to all the guidelines given by the Guinness World Records committee. Dheeshaan Booso, who mainly handled all the communications with the Guinness World Records committee, explained the intense three part application process. The seemingly simple act of establishing video conferences via Skype was wearisome owing to the difference in time zones. The provision of evidence of their accomplishment, including photographs, videos, evidence of supervision of students by the Sri Lankan Air Force and so on had to be submitted online and uploaded on to a website.
Mahen Abeyrathna described how in spite of the initial pessimism surrounding the attempt, they worked together tirelessly, day and night in the hope of achieving something great. From November 9, each rocket was tested individually for flaws. With all this hard work, when the day of the attempt dawned, they expected nothing but positive results.
Nothing is impossible!
Once they had completed the task with a total of 1950 rockets being launched successfully, they submitted the required evidence to the Guinness World Records committee and uploaded the proof to the website. Then the wait began two to three weeks following the submission in the first week of December. Booso received an email confirming that Royal College were the new record holders for the most number of water rockets released in five seconds. After informing the principal and the rest of the team, they were absolutely elated. It took five days to print and one week for the certificate to be delivered. Now, finally in possession of the certificate, they are filled with excitement and happiness.
They undertook this Herculean task with the objective of brining prestige to the Royal name and with the hope that they could prove that breaking the boundaries of the norm and testing themselves would result in unbelievable accomplishments. Being extraordinary and inventive and being open to trying new things is what helped them secure this accomplishment. Their message to their peers and fellow youth is that with will power, courage and the necessary technical skills, anything is achievable and nothing is impossible!
