To express or not To express?

What is the nature of your fear? They say that Saturn is the planet of fear, insecurity and anxiety. If you fear Saturn, you will be considered unfortunate. Even if you consider yourself as someone who is plagued with fear, you cannot claim yourself as someone unfortunate. There are many unfortunate ‘others’ who live in constant fear. They live in close proximity to you, probably without much of your attention.
Professor Kamani Jayasekara is more concerned about them.
“I do not see much difference between dogs and humans. They can also feel. We could well relate to their feelings. They share our emotions. Unfortunately people are more concerned about pedigree whenever they want to keep them as pets,”
A bulk of Jayasekara’s poetry is devoted to dogs. Someone can well state that Jayasekara is writing at a rate. She has been acclaimed with several awards too. Jayasekara traces her writing habit to her own childhood under the influence of her father, who was also a professor, while entry into university sharpened it. Jayasekara majored in Greek and Western Classics while offering English Literature as a subsidiary.
“I was taken aback by the thought engraved in their philosophy. That motivated and inspired me more to concentrate on poetry,”
Jayasekara identifies Greek philosophy as a rich fountain of thought. That thought bears similarities to oriental philosophies like Buddhism.
“The dramatists were keen on finding out the reasons behind tragedies. Since I have been a practising Buddhist, I don’t see much of a difference. It just shows that my thought stream is shaped with things beyond life. You need something insightful to entertain the reader.”
But English poetry is an almost alien sphere in Sri Lanka where the majority has difficulties in understanding the language and another portion hardly interested in the genre of poetry. All the same, Kamani Jayasekara finds enough muse to writing poetry.
“I write because I have something to tell. I mostly write to myself because I need to express my inner thoughts somehow. True, it is difficult for the majority to grasp the language. But that situation is gradually changing now, as more and more people are trying to read in English.”
But poetry is not without concerns, Jayasekara adds. “I write poetry, because I am a person who is desperately trying to put my words. It’s coming from within. Being a woman is the next problem. A reader tends to link a poetic experience with the poet’s personal life. It is unfair by the poet. A poet does not always dwell on the personal life.”
Is poetry the easiest way to enter the literary scene? You will perhaps support this statement, if you have seen the countless poetry on facebook walls. Every passing minute seems a poetic muse for them.
“You cannot write about every single thing like going to the bathroom. You should have something striking to write. And you should have a sharpened language to express them. For that you have to read a lot. Then you can write what strikes you. You need to cultivate that capacity.”
Kamani Jayasekara calls herself old fashioned as she does not approve of reading on screen.
“I do not see it as reading at all. That is problematic. When you read a physical book, you get the feel of it. You do not get it when you read on internet or screen. You do not find companionship there. It is not readership.”
