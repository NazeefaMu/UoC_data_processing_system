NFF ready to sacrifice lives to defend country: Jayantha Samaraweera

 
The National Freedom Front (NFF) Parliamentarian Jayantha Samaraweera said today NFF members were ready to sacrifice their lives to defeat any attempt of dividing country.
Addressing the media at the NFF office, MP Samaraweera said that the proposals in the interim report of the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly would completely weaken the power of the Central Government and the Parliament.
Once these proposals will be passed in the Parliament, the validity of the Parliament will become questionable, he said.
The MP also urged Maha Sangha to visit the homes of MPs and make a request not to support these proposals. Having 75 votes is enough to defeat these proposals in Parliament, he said.
