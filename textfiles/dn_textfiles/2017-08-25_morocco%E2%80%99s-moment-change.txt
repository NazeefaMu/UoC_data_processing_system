Morocco’s Moment of Change

Remembering some of the most cherished moments of world history when wedding bells tolled and two people united in love in magical surroundings
Never before had Morocco's royal family permitted any intimate scrutiny of its personal affairs; rigid control of the media and an unforgiving security service had ensured its total privacy inside Morocco. Few people recalled seeing a picture of the king's wife, nor was the public widely aware of her name (or that of his other wife).
King Mohamed VI, changed all this. The day he married Salma Bennani changed the history of royal marriages in Morocco, hopefully forever. Traditionally, the wife of the king hasn't had a public role to play. Moroccan kings have typically been polygamists prone to secret marriages to wives who remain private figures. King Mohamed VI's own mother is not photographed, and there was no "queen consort" title in Morocco.
Change came when Mohammad, who acceded the throne on the death of his father in 1999, announced his engagement. Not only did he announce that he was marrying, he identified his bride and released a picture of Salma Bennani – a 24-year-old computer expert and qualified engineer from a middle-class family in the ancient city of Fez.
The announcement, as well as his choice of a bride, came as a surprise. Salma’s father was a teacher, and her mother passed away when she was just three years old. During her formative years, the princess proved her keen mind by learning four languages – Arabic, French, English, and Spanish. She also became valedictorian at the top engineering school in Morocco, earning a degree in mathematical sciences and a state engineering diploma in computer engineering. But her lack of royal upbringing was no stumbling block for the brilliant future princess.
According to royal sources, it was love at first sight when Mohammed and Salma first met in 1999, when she was still at university. Early on she reportedly set some ground rules for their courtship, insisting on a monogamous union as a condition for accepting King Mohammed’s proposal.
The couple married in a religious ceremony in March 2002 and excited many royal watchers by releasing photos of the beautiful ceremony. Upon marriage, Salma was granted the title of 'Her Royal Highness Princess Lalla Salma' becoming the first wife of a Moroccan King to be given a royal title. ('Lalla' is a traditional name given in honour to women in high society and royalty).
The wedding took place in the form of a private Muslim ceremony on the evening of March 21st, 2002, at the Royal Palace in Rabat. The bride dressed traditionally, including donning a thick veil for a portion of the event. She let her signature red locks cascade down around her and topped them with a diamond meander tiara.
Since her marriage, Salma has landed on many “Best Dressed” lists, with a signature look comprised of beautifully appointed caftan gowns and unruly locks of flaming-red hair. She has also been named the “Most Beautiful First Lady in Africa” and ranked third on the Richest Lifestyle website. Although she does not seek the spotlight often, when she does, her style is ruled by tasteful proportions and rich embellishment.
