I Promise you a Rose Garden

So, guess what once again ranks as the No. 1 fad when it comes to outdoor leisure activities? Jogging? Nope. Biking or tennis? Wrong, try again.
Golf or swimming? Three times and you are out.
It's gardening!
The very thing that makes Willa Cather's fictional narrator gasp as he sinks into his grandmother's garden, "This is happiness!" The very thing Taylor Swift loves to do with her window boxes in New York and the very thing Julia Roberts has embraced with undying passion, composting her kitchen scraps and building an organic kitchen garden in the backyard of her Malibu home.
Forget smart phones, selfi sticks and iPads; believe it or not, the latest must-have accessory for the 21st century is fast becoming a watering can and a trowel. This is mainly because the sensory experience of gardening "allows people to connect to a primal state," says James Jiler, the founder and executive director of a nonprofit organization that creates garden and park programs for low-income neighborhoods in the US. "A lot of people understand that experience. They may not be able to put it into words, but they understand what's happening," explains Jiler.
Other rewards
Working in the garden has other, less spiritual rewards, too. In addition to providing fresh, healthy produce for your family, gardening can ease stress, keep you fit, and even improve your mood. A recent study in the Netherlands suggests that gardening can fight stress even better than other relaxing leisure activities. Here's how. After completing a stressful task, two groups of people were instructed to either read indoors or garden for 30 minutes. Afterwards, the group that gardened reported being in a better mood than the reading group, and they also had lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol."We live in a society where we're just maxing ourselves out all the time," observes Andrea Taylor, a horticulture instructor and researcher in the University of Illinois.
Taylor also notes that humans have a finite capacity for the kind of directed attention required by cell phones and email and the like, and when that capacity gets used up we tend to become irritable, error-prone, and stressed out. Fortunately this "attention fatigue" appears to be reversible. Following a theory first suggested by University of Michigan researchers in the 1980s, Taylor and other experts have argued that we can replenish ourselves by engaging in "involuntary attention," an effortless form of attention that we use to enjoy nature.
So, trading your BlackBerry for blackberry bushes could be an excellent way to fight stress and attention fatigue, as the rhythms of the natural environment and the repetitive, soothing nature of many gardening tasks are all sources of effortless attention.
"The breeze blows, things get dew on them, things flower; the sounds, the smells," says Taylor, herself a home gardener. "All of these draw on that form of attention."
Fresh air and sunshine
Another benefit of gardening is that it gets you out in the fresh air and sunshine - and it also gets your blood moving. "There are lots of different movements in gardening, so you get some exercise benefits out of it as well," says gardening expert William Maynard. True, gardening is hardly pumping iron, and unless you are hauling wheelbarrows of dirt long distances every day, it probably won't do much for your cardiovascular fitness. But digging, planting, weeding, and other repetitive tasks that require strength or stretching are excellent forms of low-impact exercise, especially for people who find more vigorous exercise a challenge, such as those who are older, have disabilities, or suffer from chronic pain.
As a pleasurable and goal-oriented outdoor activity, gardening has another advantage over other forms of exercise: People are more likely to stick with it and do it often. "It's not just exercise for exercise itself, which can become tedious," says one expert. "It's exercise that has a context, that reinforces the limberness of your limbs and the use of your hands. You've got a motivation for why you want to grip. You're not just gripping a ball, you want to pull a weed."
Some research suggests that the physical activity associated with gardening can help lower the risk of developing dementia, too. Two separate studies that followed people in their 60s and 70s for up to 16 years found, respectively, that those who gardened regularly had a 36% and 47% lower risk of dementia than non-gardeners, even when a range of other health factors were taken into account. These findings are hardly definitive, but they suggest that the combination of physical and mental activity involved in gardening may have a positive influence on the mind as the sights, smells, and sounds of the garden are said to promote relaxation and reduce stress.
Gardening in containers
And the best news is you don't need a big backyard or a green thumb to benefit from gardening. If you have very little space or experience, you can start out with just a few houseplants, or you could even try gardening in containers. "You can grow a wonderful crop of tomatoes in nothing more than a five-gallon bucket that you've cleaned really well and put holes in the bottom of," says one expert. For novices who want to learn the basics of gardening, a huge -- and somewhat overwhelming -- variety of information is available on the Web and in bookstores. But one of the best ways to get started is to meet some other gardeners, especially those living in your neighbourhood. For some great gardening tips, just start up a conversation with one of the gardeners next time you are passing by his or her garden. Now that we are experiencing afternoon showers, if you haven't started a garden yet, may I suggest that you do so, straight away. It might take some time to get used to, but it's worth it. I know because, I confess even though it has been two years since I started my garden I am still not a very good gardener. I killed a Kathurumurunga plant recently because I forgot to check the leaves for caterpillars. I have had to apologize to plants that I have planted in the wrong place. But I'm learning every day and I know, you will too, once you get down to it.
And pretty soon you will realize gardening is the only activity you can still do when you are worried or angry or sad. As ardent gardener Julie Myserson says, "Tending a garden is a meditative, humbling experience: you can't force anything, you just have to wait. And yet every time you put something in the ground, it feels like a pronouncement of faith in the future - or at least in the next few months." I hope pretty soon you will be so addicted to your new hobby you will be gardening till your whole body hurts, until you know you should stop but you can't, because you have realized nothing will make you happier than kneeling down in the dirt with the soft evening sunshine on your back, weeding a bed of roses or chili plants by hand, watched over by your cat and a friendly squirrel knowing that all around you, things are growing. Imagine being able to promise your loved one a basket of homegrown vegetables and 'a rose garden' one day soon.
Caring for plants is good for us. Here's why.
1. Better health. Producing your own food can increase your family's fruit and vegetable consumption and improve their attitude toward healthy eating.
2. Access to fresh food. Fruits and vegetables that you grow yourself are often more flavorful because they come straight from the garden to your plate. Supermarket produce is often picked before it has the chance to fully develop flavor.
3. Burn calories. Working in a garden is a great form of low-impact exercise. According to the American Council for Fitness and Nutrition, you can burn around 150 calories in just a 30- to 45-minute garden session.
4. Feel accomplished. Gardening can help build self-esteem and confidence. A healthy harvest produces a sense of achievement when you see the results of your time and effort.
5. Save money. Growing your own fruits and vegetables will help cut down on your grocery bill. Plant crops that you enjoy eating and use often such as tomatoes, chili and green-leaves
6. Improve your child's development. Studies have shown that garden-based education
improves academic performance in children and may lead to higher test scores (especially in the areas of math and science) with overall improvement on standardized achievement tests and improved positive attitudes toward learning.
7. Ease stress. Gardening can be therapeutic and relaxing. A garden can serve as a peaceful retreat from the demands of everyday life.
8. Get the whole family involved. From selecting the types of plants, to preparing the earth, planting and finally harvesting, gardening is a wonderful outdoor activity that your family can enjoy together.
9. Enhance your creativity.Designing a garden provides an outlet for creativity and expression. With the wide variety of seeds available, it's easy to experiment with new plants or change the color scheme of your garden annually.
10. Beautify the area. Gardens enhance any outdoor setting. Flowers add color and warmth to a home; trees and shrubs provide shade and shelter for birds and other wildlife.
