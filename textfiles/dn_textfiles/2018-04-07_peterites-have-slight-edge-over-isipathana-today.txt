Peterites have slight edge over Isipathana today

High riding St.Peters College Bambalapitiya will have a slight edge over unpredictable Isipathana College in their Singer ‘A’ Division inter school league rugby tournament match to be played at Havelock Park today at 4:15pm.
The St.Peters lads under the leadership of Javed Zarook have an immaculate record in this year’s ongoing league tournament where they are yet to lose a game being unbeaten.
They have won all their games thus far by beating Zahira College Maradana (48-12), Wesley College (33-17) and Dharmaraja College Kandy (42-05). St.Peters cause has been severely bolstered by the presence of their ever reliable forwards who have carried out a sensational display this season together with their whole ‘eight’ dominating the set pieces and having abundance of ball position through line outs, rucks and mauls. spear headed by cracking number eight cum captain Zarook and second row forward Nizran Nillar.
Along with their speedy three quarter line with the help of play makers Jason Karunarathna centres Raveen Fernando(who is doubtful for today’s game due to nursing an ankle injury) and Sandesh De Mel are scoring try after try through their famous three quarter moves. Also they have a reliable place kicker and his contribution in this match with his kicking boot will be highly vital for a Peterite victory.
On the other hand Isipathana College possesses a good team also being unbeaten with play maker and captain Manelka Ruberu along with their entire three quarter line can play an outstanding game to bring victory to their school but has been blowing hot and cold and is feeling the sting of the nail biting win they had against D.S.Senanayake College Colombo where they won by a whisker by (25-24) due to DSS missing the easy conversion in the final minute in their first game for the season.
In their other matches they recorded victories against Dharmaraja College Kandy (42-14) and Zahira College Maradana by 17 points to 7.
Mean while this will be a do or die battle for Isipathana College and if they lose this battle to St.Peters College today in this match, then it could be worse for them as they will slip down to second place behind Peters in the rankings.
