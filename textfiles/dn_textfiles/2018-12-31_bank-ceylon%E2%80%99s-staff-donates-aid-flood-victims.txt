Bank of Ceylon’s Staff Donates to aid flood victims

The staff of the Bank of Ceylon raised voluntary donations to aid victims of the natural disaster that has occurred due to torrential rain in the Northern Peninsula.
Standing alongside with the rest of the Sri Lankans in this difficult time, BOC’s staff also shared their thoughts with affected people and helped in providing dry rations etc, in hope of bringing relief to affected people in Northern Peninsula assisting them to rebuild their lives once again. The staff attached to the head office and all branches donated from their salary in which the Bank’s Management, Staff and trade unions organized and bought goods that were much needed by affected people. Trucks carrying dry rations and other essential commodities were dispatched from the Bank of Ceylon head office early on December 29th Saturday 2018 with the participation of the Bank’s CEO/General Manager, members of the Bank’s Corporate and Executive management and the staff. Many staff members headed to Northern Province with the donation to provide necessary manpower to distribute them following the directions received from Divisional Authorities.
Speaking on behalf of the staff the Bank’s CEO/General Manager Mr. Senarath Bandara stated that “On behalf of the Management and Staff of the Bank I extend heartfelt sympathies to families and friends who have lost their belongings and are displaced or have been adversely affected. I sincerely wish all our fellow citizens strength and courage, to face this disaster sturdily and to make every effort possible to rise up from this adverse situation”.
