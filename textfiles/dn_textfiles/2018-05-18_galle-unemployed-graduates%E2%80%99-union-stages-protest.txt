Galle Unemployed Graduates’ Union stages protest

A protest demanding employment was staged by members of the Unemployed Graduates’ Union Galle Branch yesterday in front of the Galle District Secretariat.
The protesters alleged that the government had not kept its promise in providing job opportunities to unemployed graduates in the country.
About 60,000 employment opportunities exist in the public sector and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had promised to resolve unemployment issues of graduates within three weeks, they said.
