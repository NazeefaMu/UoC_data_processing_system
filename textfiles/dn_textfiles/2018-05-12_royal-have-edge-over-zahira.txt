Royal have the edge over Zahira

The confrontation between the two school rugby teams in Royal College Colombo and Zahira College Maradana in the Singer ‘A’ Division inter-Schools league rugby second round match for the 2018 season at Royal Complex in Colombo today, should turn out to be a one sided affair. The match will kick off at 4.15 pm.
Royal who thrashed Trinity College Kandy to retain the Bradby Shield last week under the coaching of dedicated and hardworking former national rugby captain Dushanth Lewke will go out as the top contenders this year to retain the inter-schools league rugby tournament this year.
The forte of the Royal College team has been their power-packed forwards. The Royal ‘eight’ especially their ever green Sasitha Siyath, vice captain Maleesha Madumewan along with Himantha Hirushan, Samadhi Induwara, Fadhil Adahan, Risith Fernando and Ifam Fareed have always given a terrific display in the loose but today they will give a torrid time to the Zahira lads.
In the set scrums the Royal hooker Fareed should get the better of his vis-à-vis while in the line outs the Royal trio of Sasitha Siyath, Fadhil Adahan and Maleesha Madumewan will clearly out jump the Zahira duo.
With the halves combination of Nikhil De Silva and young Lehaan Gunaratne having clicked very well in the entire first round matches the Royal side will hope that Nikhil will set his three quarters in motion at every turn as they have two hard running centres in Janindu Dilshan and Thulaib Hassan..
In addition they also have two experienced wingers in skipper Shabith Feroze and Yasis Rashmika who have stood out with their powerful runs down the flank with full back Dulan Gunawardena often joining the line to form the overlap.
Zahira will have to be at their very best if they are to at least make a match of it against the formidable Royal College team in their home grounds as to date Read Avenue boys looks like an invincible team and hard to beat.
Going by the two team’s starting line ups and the performance so far in the ongoing league tournament, Royal will go out favourites in todays game.
