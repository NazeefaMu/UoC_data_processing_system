Abans launches stylish,  toxic-free all-natural furniture

Abans Homes In Style has launched outfit to your home with new and unique furniture at a price that only adds value to your home with each passing year.
The exclusive line of furniture is coupled with in-trend designs both contemporary and modern that will bring a sophisticated, eclectic look to your home.
Finding the right furniture for your home can be a perplexing task more so in a country where the choices are few and far between. Due to limited options for premium elegant furniture in Colombo, we often settle for those composed from artificial harmful materials.
This progressive new lineup of stylish, safe and ergonomic furniture is solely constructed with all-natural materials and glues such as solid wood. These elements ensure that the furniture does not emanate any toxic gases, enabling consumers to create a truly stunning home that is reflective of their own personal style whilst being extremely safe at the same time.
The predominant focus of Abans Homes In Style is to provide furniture with sophisticated designs without compromising on comfort and safety.
For instance, the unique collection of European style 3 + 2 + 1 sofa sets and sofa beds represents an all new approach in giving your living room a luxurious splendor. Abans offers the option to purchase furniture in sets or individually that can be tailor made in fabric and colour to further match the interiors of your home.
Hosting modern, bold, and trendy designs that are exclusive to Abans, these sofa sets feature high-end upholstery materials that emit an overall luxury affluence in your home.
The bedroom sets will utilize orthocare and aerobed mattresses carefully designed to provide the ultimate orthopedic comfort as they sleep.
Abans Homes In Style, located at Racecourse Colombo is designed to provide a unique brand experience, projecting an interplay between style, comfort and convenience.
Each purchase is equipped with a fabric cleaner and an after sales service that entails a free shampoo for the product in the comfort of your own home. Visit Abans Homes In Style to experience premium quality and craftsmanship of furniture that makes your house a home.
