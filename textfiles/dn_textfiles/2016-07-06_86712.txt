“Millet porridge” ideology will used to defeat govt: Basil

Former Minister Basil Rajapaksa yesterday said that “millet porridge” ideology instead of “Hoppers ideology” will be put into practice to defeat the government.
He said that many challenges are ahead of them when they are teaming up for the defeat of this government.
Rajapaska said that the United States in its annual report has said that changing the regime in Sri Lanka is a major victory. “This shows that not only voters of this country but Western countries have contributed for the SLFP government’s defeat in 2015.
He said that his government faced an unexpected defeat “Sri Lanka is the first country in the world where the party leader did not speak on election platforms in support of his candidates at the last General Election,” he said
Addressing a press conference at former President Mahinda Rajapaka’s office in Battaramulla, Basil Rajapaksa said that the Elections Commission is not functioning.
“The Elections Commissioner I knew is an independent man whose duties cannot be interfered with,”he said.
