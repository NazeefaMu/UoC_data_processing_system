JVP calls for special court to expedite corruption, fraud cases

A special court must be established to expedite the cases on corruption and fraud charges, Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said.
He was participating in the Parliamentary debate yesterday.
Dissanayake said establishing a special court for this purpose was an election pledge of the President and his government. “The on-going investigations and court cases are nothing but a drama. Those proceed very slowly and the culprits know that those won’t finish any sooner. This government will drag these cases for years,” he said. He said the legal action on completed investigations of the FCID must be fast tracked. Observing that the PRECIFAC had concluded the investigations on ITN and Negambo Lagoon Development project cases, he asked why delaying legal action on those responsible for them.
Justice Minister Dr.Wijayadasa Rajapakshe said attention has been paid to revise the country’s judicial system through Constitutional reforms.
