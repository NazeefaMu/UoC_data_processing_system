Doctors call for public-private partnership in education

The government should ensure that a child can follow the courses of his or her choice just as much as it provides free education, Movement of Doctors for the Freedom of Education Chairman, Consultant Neurosurgeon Dr. Deepal Attanayake said.
He said so at a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday. Dr.Attanayake said the government should not hinder the paths to freedom of education. There should be a public-private partnership in education according to strict methodology and standards.
The government should allow the private medical institutions that maintain proper standards, to enable students who fail to gain admission to government medical colleges by just a few marks to gain admission and pursue their career. “The Kothalawala Defence Academy was established to produce doctors during the conflict period. Therefore, we need more doctors specially during any emergency situation,” he said adding that this would enable the country to reach the WHO’s prescribed doctor-to-patient ratio and ensure a more inclusive and accommodating education system in the country.
“The standards maintained by private educational institutions are in no way inferior to that of their state counterparts although facilities and approach may differ. There is an alarming disparity between the demand for doctors as per the growth of the population and the entrance of new doctors into the system. Hundreds of thousands of aspiring and capable students have already been disenfranchised by the shortcoming of the tertiary education system and it’s time strong, new policies were enacted to transform this dire situation,” he added.
“We urge all concerned citizens to rally round the call of the doctors for freedom of education to urge the authorities to support more private educational institutions in this country, which will encourage foreign exchange savings by students obtaining their degrees in Sri Lanka, whilst thwarting the brain drain,” said Dr. Attanayake. If all the other subjects are covered by the private universities, so why not medicine?
Consultant Ontological Surgeon, Dr. L.M. Pathmalal said that those who studied at private universities never had to line up for jobs. “We should examine whether the country has benefited by the vast amount of funds spent by the government on free education. The government should provide opportunities for students to study courses of their choice.
What is the solution the government offers the 90 percent of students who cannot gain admission to the government medical colleges?” he queried.
