‘Biso-Ella’ in jeopardy

People who visit the ‘Biso-ella’ at Wilegoda that supplies drinking water to the Eheliyagoda town and several nearby villages are largely polluting it.
Illicit gem mining along the water source is also evident.
Former Eheliyagoda PS members Tilak Jayawickrama and R.Dhanaratna said drunk youngsters behaving rudely along the Biso Ella is common during the holidays.
They said no action was taken to rectify the situation to date even though the matter was discussed at the PS meeting several times.
Eheliyagoda Water Board OIC Anura Senanaike said a fence was erected to prevent the visitors from entering the water storage tank area but scattering waste continues.
“We do not have enough resources to guard the upper stream area,” he said.
Sri Lankan ancient king Mayadunne took refuge in the ‘Maligatenna’ hill area close to Eheliyagoda to prepare for enemy attacks at the time.
It is said that his princesses bathed in the waterfall.
