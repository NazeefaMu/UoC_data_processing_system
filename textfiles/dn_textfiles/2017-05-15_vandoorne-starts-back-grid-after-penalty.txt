Vandoorne starts from back of grid after penalty

Montmeló: Belgium’s Stoffel Vandoorne will start from the back of the grid at Sunday’s Spanish Grand Prix after the McLaren-Honda driver was hit with a 10-place penalty.
The penalty was handed down after his team spotted a sensor issue on his car and changed the ESS (energy store) and CE (control electronics) on his engine.
It’s the fifth component of each engine element used by Vandoorne already this year and triggers a 10-place grid penalty as a result.
However, after coming a disappointing 19th in qualifying on Saturday, Vandoorne will drop back just one place to 20th and last, behind Russia’s Daniil Kvyat of Toro Rosso. Lewis Hamilton starts on pole. AFP
