SLC to relaunch Cricket Aid at Lord’s

At a meeting of the Executive Committee of Sri Lanka Cricket, held at the SLC on Saturday the following, amongst other, important matters were ratified:
EGM to adopt 2015 audited accounts
The Executive Committee of Sri Lanka Cricket has called for an Emergency General Meeting (EGM) of Sri Lanka Cricket on the 18th of June 2016.
The purpose of the EGM is to complete the remaining items of the agenda of the Annual General Meeting, including the adoption of the Annual Report and Audited Statement of Accounts of 2015.
Cricket Aid to be relaunched at Lord’s
Sri Lanka Cricket will re-launch its Charity arm ‘Cricket Aid’ at a Charity dinner to be held at the Long Room, Lord’s Cricket Ground on the 4 June. Whilst a plate is to be priced at £200, a silent auction would be held at the Charity evening to raise funds for an earmarked national project – the elimination of CKD (Chronic Kidney Disease).
SLC headed towards possible incorporation
Sri Lanka Cricket is engaged in a transformation of the establishment, leading to constitutional changes, and even, possibly incorporation. A 5-year Corporate Strategic Plan has been envisaged, and professional input from reputed Corporate Management specialists has been sought to implement the said changes.
To this end, the Executive Committee of Sri Lanka Cricket has appointed M/s. SJMS Associates to facilitate this process, and call for Expressions of Interests from recognized Corporate Management Specialists. A high level Corporate Planning and Governance Committee will be appointed to drive this process.
