Multi-party talks on new Constitution to be held

There will be multi-party talks outside the Steering Committee to arrive at an agreement on core matters relating to the new Constitution, informed sources said.
The SLFP, UNP, TNA and the JVP are likely to take part in these discussions to be convened with the presence of President Maithripala Sirisena.
“All parties supportive of Constitutional making will have deliberations in the coming days outside the Steering Committee to arrive at an agreement on the basic issues in the Constitution,” he said.
The Joint Opposition is unlikely to attend these discussions.
The Steering Committee headed by the Prime Minister met at the Parliamentary Complex yesterday. Parliamentary sources said the SLFP requested further time to discuss the draft interim report with other parties. The Steering Committee will meet in February again.
