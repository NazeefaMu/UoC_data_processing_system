Catholic Bishops’ Conference calls for restraint

The Catholic Bishops’ Conference in Sri Lanka in a statement yesterday appealed to all religious and political leaders and other organisations to cooperate in a spirit of dialogue and understanding to prevent a disastrous conflict.
“It is destructive to give religious twists to isolated incidents, leaving room to extremists to create a conflageration, let no one add fuel to fire. Such acts will not protect the country, religions or race but rather insult, discredit and betray them”, the statement said.
“The Catholic Bishops’ Conference in Sri Lanka is deeply concerned about the disturbances which have arisen in the country during the past few days.
“Considering that this country has a multi ethnic and multi religious co composition, we need to promote and foster harmony to live in peace.
“As citizens of Sri Lanka, we ought to look at the prevailing situation and its consequences wisely and with foresight. Having learnt from our past experiences, we should look at all incidents as having potential to unleash violence. Therefore, let us be realistic, humane and compassionate in dealing with events of this nature. We do not need outsiders to teach us of the importance of living in peace and harmony; we have the four major religions to teach, us of the spiritual values.
“Therefore, it is destructive to give a religious twist to isolated incidents, leaving room to extremists to crate a conflagration; let no one and fuel to fire. Such acts will not protect the country, religion or race but rather insult, discredit and betray them.
“We earnestly request all religious and political leaders and other organisations to cooperate in a spirit of dialogue and understanding to prevent a disastrous conflict. We all realise that the path of reconciliation and harmony is an arduous process where patient commitment, and courageous dedication of every one is required in achieving it.
“Towards this end, we the Catholic Bishops’ Conference in Sri Lanka seek the good will of every one to help restore order and peace while praying for God’s blessing upon our dear country, Rt. Rev. Dr. Winston Fernando, President, Catholic Bishops’ Conference in Sri Lanka and Rt. Rev.Dr.Valence Mendis, Secretary General, Catholic Bishops’ Conference in Sri Lanka said yesterday.
