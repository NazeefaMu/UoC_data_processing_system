World Bank asked to apologise to Bangladesh

 
Law Minister Anisul Huq has asked the World Bank to apologise to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for bringing charges of corruption in the Padma Bridge project.
He raised the demand during a discussion in Parliament on Sunday after a Canadian court acquitted three business executives of charges of planning to bribe Bangladeshi officials to get the Padma Bridge job.
He also said legal steps could be taken against the World Bank over the incident.
An enormous pressure mounted on Bangladesh when the World Bank brought the allegation, setting conditions and forcing Bangladesh to investigate the complaint.
Senior government officials, including the then bridges secretary Mosharraf Hossain Bhuiyan, were arrested and communications minister Syed Abul Hossain had to step down. PM’s Adviser Moshiur Rahman was also sent on forced leave.
The investigation by Bangladesh’s Anti-Corruption Commission found no proof of the allegation brought by the World Bank.
The World Bank, however, rejected Bangladesh’s findings and withdrew the funds it had promised for the project. Bangladesh is now building the bridge with its own money.Now Canada has also found the evidence as ‘speculation and rumour’.
Following the publication of the Canadian court verdict, ruling Awami League leaders have spoken out against the World Bank and the section of media which reported extensively on the issue.
On Sunday, opposition Jatiya Party MP Kazi Firoz Rashid raised the issue in Parliament and demanded the law minister’s statement.
“The World Bank will have to apologise to Bangladesh, the prime minister and those accused in the case. If they (WB) do not do so, I will ask the finance minister to send a protest note,” Huq said.
Huq recalled his experience as the then chief counsel of the ACC when the investigation was under way.He said the World Bank delegation, which was sent to assist the investigation, wanted to do the job itself. But the government refused the proposal.
“The World Bank delegation wanted to know why Abul Hossain was not named in the FIR. There was nearly a quarrel. I said everyone would have to accept whatever the investigation finds. We suddenly heard a case was started in Canada,” the law minister said.
‘I have names’
After leaving the World Bank option out of the project, Prime Minister Hasina said there had been a conspiracy to stop the global lender from funding the Padma Bridge. (The Padma Bridge is a multipurpose road-rail bridge across the Padma River to be constructed in Bangladesh.)
Law Minister Huq told Parliament that the World Bank delegation, headed by Luis Moreno Ocampo, a former chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, met ‘other Bangladeshis’ after meeting him.
“I have details about whom they had dined with at the World Bank country director’s (Robert Zoellick’s) house that night after meeting me,” Huq said.The MPs then demanded that he make the names public.
“I will tell you everything. I have details. But this is not the place to reveal the names,” Huq replied Commerce Minister Tofail Ahmed proposed to take a ‘thanksgiving motion’ for the prime minister. “We should tell her that she was right, she took the right decision,” he said.
Hasina has been blaming Nobel peace laureate Muhammad Yunus for ‘influencing’ the withdrawal of the funds by the World Bank.Her son Sajeeb Wazed Joy has also brought the same allegation after the publication of the Canadian court verdict.
Agriculture Minister Matia Chowdhury told Parliament: “Dr Yunus was behind this.”
Tofail slammed Ganaforum President Dr Kamal Hossain for criticising the government for backing Abul Hossain. Jatiya Party’s Ziauddin Ahmed Bablu said the ‘local agents’ of the World Bank should be exposed.
Awami League MP Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim questioned the spending of Yunus. Syed Abul Hossain, one of the persons hit hardest by the World Bank allegation, has already demanded explanation from the critics, without naming those.Jatiya Party MP Rashid asked the law minister about steps taken against those who damaged the national image.
“Those, who raised their voice along with the foreigners over the Padma Bridge and undermined the government, are the enemies of the country. They should face effective measures,” said Tofail. CNN
