Students urge to reopen Jaffna Uni

The University of Jaffna Students' Council requested the administration to change the reopening date of the university from May 21 to May 8.
The University was closed for Vesak celebrations.
However, the Students' Council claimed that the university was closed for months due to the strike launched by its non-academic staff.
They said the university started on April 23 and closed on the same day for Vesak.
The council has not received any reply for their request from the administration yet.
They claimed that it is unreasonable for the administration to close the university for a long period for Vesak. The administration decided to reopen the university on May 21 during a meeting held on April 26.
