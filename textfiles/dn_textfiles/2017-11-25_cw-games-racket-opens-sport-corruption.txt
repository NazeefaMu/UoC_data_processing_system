CW Games racket opens the sport of corruption

The Bond scam issue remains the topic of political and public interest, and has raised the issue of other major scams that need proper investigation and action by this government in keeping with its pledge to fight corruption, as Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe did get another feather in his political cap as the first holder of this office to appear before a commission of inquiry.
The call by Minister Kabir Hashim for a commission to probe the Commonwealth Games 2018 bidding exercise has certainly raised the possibility and opportunity for another important probe that can expose a huge exercise in corruption through the athletics of fraud, which will be commented below.
The Prime Minister’s presence at the Presidential Commission of Inquiry, with a large entourage of ministers, especially from the UNP, brought the public sessions of the Commission to a well publicized conclusion, as it settles down to finalizing its report on the Treasury Bond Scam. His evidence, led by the Attorney General, and based on affidavits submitted to the Commission, did underline the issues of conflict of interest involving the appointment of Arjun Mahendran as Governor of the Central Bank shortly after the Yahapalana change of the Executive Presidency in January 2015. The PM’s evidence made it clear there was no policy decision to request State Bank to bid at low yield rates during Treasury bond auctions, which instruction was given to State bank heads by former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
The issue of conflict of interest relating to the functioning of Arjun Aloysius and Perpetual Treasuries Ltd., in the Treasury bond transactions, and the role of Ravi Karunanayake amidst a larger role of conflicted interests in transactions with Perpetual Treasuries, remain major issues the UNP will have to face it supporting its image on fighting against corruption, as the politics of coalition goes into even more strain, despite the postponement of Local Government polls, due to the Appeal Court’s suspension of the Delimitation Gazette, earlier this week.
The Local Government Poll delay will certainly be the stuff of emerging political rivalry, with a No Confidence motion already presented against Minister of Local Government Faiszer Musthapha.
Phone link turmoil
The Treasury bond scam has moved in a different direction of political vulnerability with concerns by UNP members of the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) following the evidence on some of its members who had telephone links with Arjun Aloysius, the Perpetual Crisis agent in the Bond Scam.
While some members have come very clean about those connections, with Harshana Rajakaruna stating his phone conversations with Aloysius were even before he became an MP, and Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera stating Aloysius did ask for his help to be cleared on the Treasury Bond issue, but he had refused it. The issue now being raised is of the CID that found these links allegedly violating the privileges of Members of Parliament. Surprisingly, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa says the government has now moved to ’phone tapping’, and was very concerned about the rights and privileges of MPs.
The subject of Parliamentary Privilege is a matter that Parliament may have to decide upon, but as the Presidential Commission has stated, these phone records were not obtained from their (the MPs) phones, but from the phones and communication devices of Arjun Aloysius of Perpetual Treasuries, and his father-in-law Arjun Mahendran, former Governor of the Central Bank. The phone tapping charge is certainly not of substance. But, what is of importance, is that the affected members of COPE, and did not think it necessary to inform COPE about their phone links with Perpetual Treasury Aloysius. Such declaration, when one is in the midst of an inquiry into the actions of such person, is the best practice of integrity in action.
Sujeewa Senasinghe did have a huge confrontation with Namal Rajapaksa of the Joint Opposition, which was more to do with the latter’s legal education and not on one’s own phone links with Aloysius. The reality of the reported 62 calls between Senasinghe and Arjun Aloysius will certainly be interesting, and we will now have to await the book Senasinghe is said to be writing on the current issue - possibly the Bond Scam – to know how useful these calls must have been.
We will have to await the final report of the Presidential Commission to know the full details of the Treasury Bond Scam, the stuff of political interest, especially after the Yahapalana pledge to fight corruption in the campaign to defeat Mahinda Rajapaksa’s moves to have a permanent executive presidency.
Commonwealth Games corruption
The wider public interest in the Treasury Bond Scam has led to many UNP members of parliament, to ask why there are no Commissions of Inquiry into other suspicious and fraudulent transactions during the previous regime. Whether it is a commission of inquiry or a regular Police probe, involving the CID or FCID, there are several such issues that need good investigation, and subsequent legal action. The election of the Common Candidate Maithripala Sirisena, as President in January 2014, had much to do with the pledge to fight the corruption that prevailed. It is an irony of politics that the biggest exposure has gone to the Treasury Bond Scam under his government. But, there any many big scandals that exist and need to be exposed from the not too distant past, and one such graft of major proportions was the bid to host the “next” Commonwealth Games in Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka lost the bid to host the 2018 Commonwealth Games go Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia, at the bidding held in March 2010 at Basseterre, St. Kitts island of the West Indies. Sri Lanka’s bid was based on Hambantota as the main venue of the 2018 Games, and was part of the promotion of Hambantota as the rising centre of development and a sports hub in the country; part of the push for Hambantota as the Growth Centre of the island under the Rajapaksa Regime. But the bid, actively promoted by former Governor of the Central Bank, Ajith Nivard Cabraal and Namal Rajapaksa, did not look at the realities of the bid, which cost the country many millions of funds – both from the State and other contributors.
The basic fact that those who planned and organised the bid did not consider, although they were told of the reality, is that India had already hosted the Commonwealth Games in 2010, and it would be too early for another South Asian country, and so close, to seek the Games after the succeeding Games in Scotland.
The record of the Games – from the British Empire Games – 1930 to 1950, British Empire and Commonwealth Games – 1954 to 1966, British Commonwealth Games 1970 to 1974, and the Commonwealth Games -1978 to 2014, would have shown the bidders that never in this record has any country that is such a close neighbour to a country where the Games was once held, has been chosen for the “next” game after eight years. Scotland had already been decided as the venue for the Games immediately after India. So Sri Lanka’s was the bid for the “next" Games.
The huge fraud, amounting to clearly more than Rs. 200 million was the result of the rejection of common sense in making this bid, knowing very well that Sri Lanka would not be the winner. It was very much in order to make a bid for a ‘future’ Games, say even eight years later, with a not too extravagant and wasteful bid such as what that took place at St. Kitts island, in March 2010.
Minister Kabir Hashim is now calling for a commission to investigate this whole fraudulent exercise, with the revelation that the CWG Hambantota 2018 (Pvt) Ltd that was established for this purpose has no records of expenditure, and the purposes of the use of available funds. There must be records with the FCID of some of this failed exercise, because it did launch an initial inquiry, and a key person involved in it, did make some statements, which were given publicity in the media, too.
The loss to the country is far more than Rs, 200 million, if the full exercise is probed and the records on this common sense ridden bid are fully probed. The expenses involved the large number of dancers and entertainers taken from here, and the costs of entertainment that took place at St. Kitts, as well as processional dancing of the leaders in this fraudulent bid. The local media did publish reports and photographs of the “bidders” in action, and some links to the CHOGM Conference held in Australia just before the St. Kitts exercise, can also give more information.
A commission or any other good probe will certainly show how the rejection of common sense enabled a highly crooked, hugely costly and vastly wasteful ‘sporting exercise’ for the Commonwealth Games 2018.
