Grero reveals alarming statistics in education sphere

It is alarming that of the total number who enter Grade One in school only 17 to 20 percent proceed to Higher Education, Higher Education State Minister Mohan Lal Grero said. According to statistics, of the students who proceed to primary education, around 87 percent go up to Secondary Education. Of this number, only 50 percent enter tertiary education.
But it is significant that less than 20 percent of the country's student population make their way to higher education.
But in developed countries the rate of students entering Higher Education is nearing 98 - 99 percent. Even in certain Asian countries such as Japan and Korea the amount is similar to developed countries.
"It can be presumed that structure and procedure governing our national examinations, have become a barrier for more students to enter tertiary or higher education."
"Certain mathematics and scientific formulas taught at Ordinary Level are not used or utilised until the end of a student's life unless that student becomes a teacher or an engineer. The examination structure, especially the Ordinary Level and Advanced Level Examinations have created a hindrance for students to go up the academic ladder," Grero said.
The minister stressed that school curricular should be revised so as to adapt it to the modern and advanced world. The curricular should be revised after considering the trends in the education sector and the demands and needs of the modern world, he said.
"This examination system is not suitable to identify the capacity and ability of a student. Certain abilities such as language ability and mathematical ability are not used in his or her lifetime," Grero said.
