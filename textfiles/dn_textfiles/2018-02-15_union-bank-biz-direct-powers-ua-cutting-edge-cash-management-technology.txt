Commenting on the partnership the General Manager Finance and Planning of Union Assurance PLC, Sherin Cader said, “Running a business in today's competitive market space can be quite complex. Business owners must juggle multiple operational demands and ensure products or services meet customers’ needs effectively and efficiently while staying atop the latest technological trends. With so much going on, it is beneficial to streamline some processes to free up time to focus on more value adding tasks. One such area which we at Union Assurance identified is the management of our claims payment process, thereby the cash out flows. This is why we believe that Union Bank's Biz Direct solution will enable our company to avoid common inefficiencies and risks in the payment process as it is a customisable solution with the right combination of services that can lead to improved security and speed while at the same time increasing business efficiency by freeing up time and resources in-house.”
Union Bank's Chief Manager/Head of Transaction Banking and Cash Management Pasindu Dharmasiri said, “I'm pleased to announce the completion of the inaugural integration of UB Enterprise solution powered through Union Bank Biz Direct for UA, to enable faster, efficient and more precise payments and cash management processes for the company. As one of the trusted cash management partners of one of the leading insurers in the country, we believe that this partnership will afford UA many exclusive benefits by simplifying otherwise cumbersome processes such as Current account management, vendor payment management, cash collection and distribution of dividends.”
Vice President Wholesale Banking of Union Bank, Hiranthi De Silva said, “Cash management services are evolving rapidly with the aid of technology and many businesses aren't still taking advantage of these facilities to ease their burdens of collecting, depositing and disbursing funds. Also, some businesses don't monitor for cheque frauds or unauthorised transactions, which could be a costly oversight if an incident were to occur. Inefficiencies like these that cost businesses both time and money, could be completely avoided with an electronically managed process. Union Bank Biz Direct is one such groundbreaking cash management solution which would change the way businesses manage their cash flows by adding a layer of security while boosting efficiencies by a few notches.”
