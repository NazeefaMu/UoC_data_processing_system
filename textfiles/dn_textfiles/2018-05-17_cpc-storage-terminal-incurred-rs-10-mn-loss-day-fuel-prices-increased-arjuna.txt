CPC Storage Terminal incurred Rs. 10 mn  loss on day fuel prices increased: Arjuna

Minister Arjuna Ranatunga stated that the Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminal (CPST) has lost around Rs. 10 Million the day fuel price was hiked. He further mentioned that they are taking severe action against the wrongdoers after investigations and they are taking steps to claim the lost amount from them. He made this remarks during a programme held at the Gampaha Divisional Secretariat office, yesterday.
The Government decide to increase the prices of fuel on May 10 midnight which was declared in the morning of the same day. In such a situation, the same day orders are cancelling temporarily. However, initial investigations had revealed that 52 fuel bowsers from the Kolonnawa terminal and 22 fuel bowsers from the Muthurajawela terminal had been released following the same day order. By this smuggle, the Kolonnawa terminal had incurred a loss of Rs.6,580,200, while the Muthurajawela terminal had lost Rs.2,468,400.
Investigations disclosed that some regional fuel distribution centers also had released a stock of fuel following the same day orders.
“This smuggle had taken place, following the wrong procedure. Some filling stations had received stocks of fuel within the same day, which was not received for weeks. There are customers who have paid for fuel the day before the price hike, but not received the stocks, while the customers who had paid and received stocks within hours. We are processing investigations to identify the offenders. We will hand them over for further investigations to the FCID. This smuggle had been taking place for years.
I will take severe action to stop wrongdoings. Some ministers are also trying to push us up when we are trying to catch thieves,” the Minister further added.
