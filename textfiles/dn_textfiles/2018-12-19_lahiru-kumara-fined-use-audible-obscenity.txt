Lahiru Kumara fined for use  of an audible obscenity

Lahiru Kumara has been fined 15 per cent of his match fee and has also received one demerit point after being found guilty of a Level 1 breach of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel during the third day’s play in the first Test against New Zealand at the Basin Reserve in Wellington on Monday.
The Sri Lanka bowler was found to have violated Article 2.3 of the code, which relates to “use of an audible obscenity during an international match”.
Kumara used an audible obscenity after an outside edge off Tom Latham’s bat in the 96th over went for a boundary. These comments were heard by the on-field umpires and also picked by the stump mic.
After the day’s play, Kumara admitted the offence and accepted the sanction proposed by Richie Richardson of the Emirates ICC Elite Panel of Match Referees and, as such, there was no need for a formal hearing.
The charge was levelled by on-field umpires Rod Tucker and Michael Gough, third umpire Richard Illingworth, all from the Emirates ICC Elite Panel of Umpires, as well as fourth umpire Tim Brown.
Level 1 breaches carry a minimum penalty of an official reprimand, a maximum penalty of 50 per cent of a player’s match fee, and one or two demerit points.
