Kalmunai MC joins with Nuremberg MC for education, health development

Nuremberg Municipal Council’s delegates have joined hands with Kalmunai Municipal Council for education and health development in Kalmunai MC.
A bilateral discussion was held recently at the Kalmunai Municipal Council. The discussion was led by Kalmunai Mayor A.M. Rakeeb with the participation of members of KMC and other prominent citizens. Amanul Haneefa, consultant to the Nuremberg MC, addressed the gathering about the significance of the dual city development project and the memorandum of understanding.
“Nuremberg is one of the main cities in Germany. World-famous companies, professionals, scientist, and engineers live in the city. I’m very sad that Kalmunai has been polluted by garbage. We have to keep the city clean. We have included only Kalmunai in Sri Lanka under this project. It is now on the point of becoming a success. Former member of the Eastern Provincial Council A.M. Jameel took necessary steps to sign an agreement to develop this city. The former mayor officially visited Germany to sign the MOU with Nuremberg city. We wish to develop Kalmuani in priority sectors. If you give your fullest support to us, it will be a successful project in the future,” said Haneefa.
