In the wake of escalating fuel prices
‘Govt should encourage  import of electric cars’

In the wake of escalating fuel prices the government must look at bringing in more tax concessions and provide other facilities to encourage the import of electric cars, said Director at IMEX LINK (PVT) LTD, Kirilopona, Amara Wijegunasekara.
He said that around four years ago the tax on electric car imports were reduced but was removed two years ago. “However the present Minister of Finance and Media, Mangala Samaraweera has reduced a duty on eclectic car imports to a certain extent. But this is not enough,” he said.

Wijegunasekara said that they were the pioneers in introducing the Electric vehicle Nissan Leaf to Sri Lanka in 2013 February and even to date keeps importing more electric cars. “We import them direct from our joint venture company in Uk, ADB Global.”
He said that today electric vehicles are preferred by all over the world and new R&D in to this segment has helped to create cars like Tesla Electric Car which could travel over 900 KM from one single charge. Benz, Renault, BMW, Jaguar and all other European, Korean and Japanese car manufacturing too are now producing high-end electric vehicles.
A recent study done by Loughborough University London shows that over 250, 000 new direct and indirect employment has been created since the introduction of the electric cars to UK and each year the country saves 51 billion pounds from fuel that would have gone to the use of petrol cars. He said that in Japan, Europe and UK government also provides special subsidies for people using electric cars.
He said that in addition to zero emissions the electric car also don’t use engine oil as well.
Commenting on Sri Lanka he said that the infrastructure for electric charging points are now getting in to place. “The latest is the two points at the Southern Expressway and also several hotels too have charging points for electric powered vehicles. The IOC fuel stations too would soon have charging points.”
He said that in a bid to provide new electric cars to Sri Lanka, IMEX LINK (PVT) LTD will be introducing three new models to the Sri Lankan market soon. The Hyundai KONA would be a SUV that could drive for 480 Km in a single charge while Hyundai IONIQ and Renault ZOE too could be drive over 300 Km from single charge.
He also said that today due to the efficiency, new innovations and most importantly more miles from single charge electric vehicle are turning out to be the main car of the family and no longer the second car.

Solar powered car would be still been developed and it would take at least another decade before it becomes a reality.
He said that IMEX LINK (PVT) LTD, is also member of the Vehicle Importers Association and Eclectic Vehicle Club (EVC) which is working closely with the government.
We are also in the process of getting the approval to implement a successful method to dispose used electric car batteries efficiently so that Sri Lanka could import electric car batteries.
