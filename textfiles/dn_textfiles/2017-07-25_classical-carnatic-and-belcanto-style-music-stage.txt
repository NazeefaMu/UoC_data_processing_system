Classical, Carnatic and Belcanto style music on stage

Shruthi, vocal music concert featuring Devin Ganegoda will be held on July 29 at 6.30 pm at the Bishop’s College auditorium. The concert is a combination of both classical Carnatic and Belcanto style music.
Music compositions and live directions with full orchestra for this evening are done by leading Carnatic composer, lecturer and vocalist A. Aruran, well known music composer, Visharada Samantha Perera and by Francis D’ Almeida who is one of the most senior and eminent vocal trainers in the country. Samantha Perera will be creating music for two new songs and the lyrics are done by Prof. Praneeth Abeysundara and Preethi Ganegoda.
Devin’s mother, Preethi Ganegoda is an eminent Bharathanatyam dancer. Therefore Carnatic music was something he grew up with.
“I anyway liked Carnatic music. I started listening to it from my childhood. I believe the interest was in me from those days. However I started learning Carnatic music only after finishing my O/Ls,” says Devin.
Devin, a 17 year old, is studying in the science stream. He says his ultimate goal is to become an astrophysicist and work for NASA.
“I have great interest in music and Bharathanatyam. It will always be no matter what my profession is going to be. I believe music can develop someone’s personality in a great way.”
Devin’s mother who is the organiser of the concert, Shruthi says that Devin always sets himself the highest targets for personal progress for achievement.
“His dedication to classical music is a reflection of his essential qualities as a dedicated, committed and passionate young person. All these inspired to organise this concert for him to reach this pivotal moment. This concert is a culmination of tireless years of enthusiasm and effort. It is an honor for me to be his mother and mentor.”
On the day of the concert, Devin’s sister, 11 year old Natalie Anuththara, will also be performing to her brothers’ song. She will be launching her book on Bharathanatyam named, The divine dance- Bharathanatyam.
Many Scholars and reputed artists will grace the occasion.
