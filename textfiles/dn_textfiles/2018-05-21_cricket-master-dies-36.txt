Cricket master  dies at 36

 
Uditha Herath, master-in-charge of cricket at Lexicon International School, Kandy passed away at the age of 36 years after a brief illness.
The sudden death of Uditha was really a shock to the cricketers and students as well as the staffers of the school. Herath taught Computer Science & Information Technology in the school skillfully and he was a very kind hearted person close to the students.
He helped the school to promote cricket with the Under 15 team reaching the final stage of the tournament as debutants. His untimely death occurred while he was preparing for the forthcoming under 17 cricket tournament.
An IT Graduate from the South Australian University Herath produced extraordinary results in the school as a teacher. He is the son of Prof. H.M. Herath formerly of the Dept. of Sociology, University of Peradeniya.
His funeral takes place at Mahaiyawa Cemetery today (Monday) at 3.00 p.m.
