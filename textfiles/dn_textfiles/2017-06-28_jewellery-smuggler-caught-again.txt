Jewellery smuggler caught again

A Sri Lankan in his mid-thirties was arrested by the Customs at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) yesterday attempting to smuggle more than two kilograms of gold and diamond jewellery into the country.
Customs Deputy Director Parakrama Basnayake said the smuggler who arrived from Bangkok was a textile businessman from Bandaragama.
The Customs was yet to value the seized stock as it had a large quantity of diamonds, pearls and rubies. According to Basnayake the gold jewellery was found hidden inside his luggage.
