Global warming

Global warming is a phenomena in which there is a gradual increase in the average temperature of the Earth’s atmosphere and its oceans. This change is believed to have serious implications on our planet and is permanently changing the Earth’s climate. This can be also seen as an implication of man’s greedy nature and the over exploitation of our mother nature in the hunt for more resources.
For centuries we have brutally exploited our resources, thoughtlessly wasted it and reaped profits without a thought about our future generations. Over the last century, the average temperature of the globe has increased by more than 1°F or 0.7°C .Global warming is primarily a problem because of too much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere which acts as a blanket, trapping heat and warming the planet more and more. As we burn fossil fuels like coal, petrol, diesel and natural gas for energy or cut down and burn forests to create plantations, carbon accumulates and overloads our atmosphere.
Certain waste management and agricultural practices aggravate the problem by releasing other potent global warming gases, such as methane and nitrous oxide. A warming world also has the potential to change rainfall patterns, increase droughts and severe storms, melt glaciers, increase sea levels, and even change plant and animal behaviour.
Today we have substantial scientific evidence which indicates that an increase in the global average temperature of more than 2°F above from where we are today poses severe risks to the natural systems and the human health and well-being. The world has already realized the potential aftermath of Global warming and has started a massive campaign to reduce its effect. There is no single solution to global warming but a multi faced approach like focusing more towards clean and green energy production, increasing the efficiency of the current systems, gradual facing out of the fossil fuels, prevention of deforestation and ensuring sustainable development etc. can be taken to solve this problem. Countries around the world have been submitting their pledges to the United Nations, displaying how far they intend to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions over a period of time.
