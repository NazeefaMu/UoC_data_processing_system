Lawyers for Democracy disappointed with BASL

A ‘New Constitution’ which includes abolishing the Executive Presidency, greater devolution of power and electoral reform, has been an unrealized electoral promise of the Presidential Candidates since 1994, Lawyers for Democracy said in response to the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL).
Issuing a statement on Saturday, the Lawyers for Democracy stated that it was disappointing that the BASL would raise an ignorant question as “What is the need/requirement for a new Constitution?” at this stage of the reform process.
