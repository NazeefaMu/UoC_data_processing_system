Estate workers protest low pay

A protest was held in front of the Kilinochchi District Secretariat yesterday supporting tea estate workers and demanding that their daily wage be increased to Rs.1,000.
The protest was organised by the Tamil National Alliance of the Kilinochchi district. The estate workers demanding to be paid fairly for their quantum of work said their present low salaries were unjust. They said they are not asking for any benefits, but a fair wage for their work.
MP C. Shridharan and TNA Provincial Council members also participated in the protest.
