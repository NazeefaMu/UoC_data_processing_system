Brandix partners world’s biggest squash championship for 4th year

Continues its role as Official Apparel Solutions Partner of J.P. Morgan Tournament of Champions in New York, the Brandix Group returned to the global sporting stage last week when Sri Lanka’s top exporter partnered with the J.P. Morgan Tournament of Champions in New York for the fourth consecutive year as a Bronze Sponsor and Official Apparel Solutions Partner of the world’s largest spectator squash event. As part of its sponsorship of this Professional Squash Association (PSA) World Series event, Brandix presented custom-designed and branded players’ shirts to the players in the Men’s and Women’s draws.
The 2017 J.P. Morgan Tournament of Champions (ToC) celebrated its 20th year of presenting the world’s best squash players in competition at Grand Central Terminal’s Vanderbilt Hall on a specially-constructed four-walled glass court. With 64-player women’s and men’s main draws, and 32 player qualifying draws to determine the eight main draw qualifying spots, the ToC featured 128 of the world’s top-ranking squash players competing in front of sell-out crowds throughout tournament week.
The Tournament of Champions traces its distinguished international squash lineage back to 1930 when it was first staged as the 'U.S. Professional.' In the late 70s it became the World Professional Squash Championships and then the Tournament of Champions in 1993. The list of titleholders is a veritable 'who’s who' of squash through the years. The tournament has been played in 17 different cities, but is now closely identified with its majestic Grand Central Terminal venue where it was first presented in 1995.
