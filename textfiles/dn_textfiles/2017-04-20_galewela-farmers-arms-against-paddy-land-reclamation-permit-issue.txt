Galewela farmers up in arms against paddy land reclamation permit issue

Farmers in Galewela are up in arms against the alleged issuing of six permits to reclaim paddy lands in the area contravening the accepted procedure. Reclamation work started on two plots of paddy lands has been suspended on the orders of Divisional Secretary M. U. Nishantha, they said.
Farmers allege that those involved in reclamation work had obtained the permits from the Agrarian Services Commissioner General.
Kudawewa ‘Gemunu’ Farmers’ Association President T. D. A. Appuhamy said illegal reclamation work started in a paddy field in Kudawewa by an individual was halted on the orders of the Divisional Secretary.
The prevention of such illegal reclamation work is vested in a range of officials from the level of agricultural research and production assistants to the District Development Committee. Allowing illegal reclamation of paddy lands was a bad precedent. They hoped to petition the President about it, they said.
The other paddy field subjected to reclamation comes under the wing of the Ranketha Farmers’ Association. Its secretary said this reclamation was illegal as no application had been made to his association in this regard.
The Galewela Divisional Secretary said a report on the reclamation of these paddy lands had been submitted to the Agrarian Services Commissioner General and other authorities. He said he will request a CID investigation into the matter.
Matale Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Services P. G. Somaratne said he had sent a fax message to the Agrarian Services Director General requesting him to cancel the six permits issued by a former Commissioner.
