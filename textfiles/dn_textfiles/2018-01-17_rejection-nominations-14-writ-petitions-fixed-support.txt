Rejection of nominations; 14 writ petitions fixed for support

The Court of Appeal yesterday fixed for Friday (19) to support 14 writ petitions filed by various political parties for rejecting their party nominations.
The parties including the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) have sought Mandamus writs directing the Returning Officers to accept the nomination papers delivered to the Election Officers by the political parties for the Local Authorities Election.
When the petitions came up before Court of Appeal (President) Justice Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Shiran Gunaratne, counsel who appeared on behalf of petitioners moved an earlier date to support the petitions citing that that they want to support petitions before postal voting to be held on January 21.
Senior Deputy Solicitor General Arjuna Obeysekara appearing for the Election Commission said he will make his submissions under three categories.
The SLPP, National People's Party, United National Freedom Party and the Janasetha Peramuna have filed writ petitions in the Court of Appeal seeking an Interim Order restraining the Election Commission from taking further steps under the provisions of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance to proceed with holding the election to the relevant local authorities.
President’s Counsel Manohara de Silva with Senior Counsel Kanishka Vitharana appeared for the petitioners.
Senior Deputy Solicitor General Arjuna Obeysekara appeared for the District returning officers. President’s Counsel Chandaka Jayasundara with counsel Pulasthi Rupasinghe and Meheran Careem appeared for the UPFA General Secretary.
