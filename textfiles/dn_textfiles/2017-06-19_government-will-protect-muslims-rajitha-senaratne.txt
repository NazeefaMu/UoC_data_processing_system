This government will protect Muslims: Rajitha Senaratne

 
No matter who acts against Muslims, this government will protect Muslims and punish who harass them, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said.
The Minister said this while addressing a Ramadan Festival held in Colombo recently.
According to Minister Senaratne, the national unity built by him at Beruwala was destroyed by some miserable persons.
`The houses and shops were rebuilt but we could not mend hearts. I simply do not know how many have become fundamentalists from that incident. We will not allow such incidents to take place in the future', he said.
` We should respect our own religion as well as other religions. Muslims may have problems. But I faced more serious problems because I stood for Muslims', he said.
