Joint proposals on SAITM handed over to President

A set of proposals jointly signed by the Government Medical Officers' Association, SAITM Medical Students' Parents' Association and the Parents' Union of State Medical Students was handed over to the President yesterday at 10.30 am at the Presidential Secretariat in Colombo, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
According to Dr. Aluthge, the document handed over to the President stresses the importance of not violating the basic rules, regulations and fundamentals of medical education in Sri Lanka. The solution proposed through the document enables all SAITM students to obtain the registration of the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) and practice as legal doctors in Sri Lanka without problems.
According to the proposals, all SAITM students should be given an MBBS that would enable them to get themselves registered with the SLMC. The MBBS should be an already existing, recognized one and not a newly created one after the passing out of the SAITM students, he said.
The document states that a majority had proposed the MBBS offered by Kotelawala Defence University for all qualified and willing SAITM students while all other SAITM students can obtain the MBBS from the Nizhni Novgorod University in Russia or any other foreign University recognized by the SLMC.
“The Russian university was mentioned by the SAITM owner in order to mislead SAITM students when he recruited them to the SAITM,” he added.
