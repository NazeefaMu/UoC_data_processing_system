Giroud reaches century as Arsenal win in Belarus

Paris: Olivier Giroud got his 100th Arsenal goal as a youthful Gunners side beat BATE Borisov 4-2 in Belarus in the Europa League on Thursday. Theo Walcott netted twice for the Premier League club and Rob Holding was also on target as they eased to a second victory in as many matches in Group H.
Arsene Wenger's side beat Cologne 3-1 at home in their first outing a fortnight ago, and the Germans lost again on Thursday, going down 1-0 at home to Red Star Belgrade.
Wenger made nine changes to the Arsenal team after they travelled to eastern Europe on the back of a 2-0 win over West Bromwich Albion on Monday. Only Shkodran Mustafi and Mohamed Elneny kept their places, while a number of youngsters featured with Joe Willock being handed a first senior start.
It was two comparative veterans who combined for Arsenal's early opener, though, with Jack Wilshere setting up Walcott to head in from close range.
