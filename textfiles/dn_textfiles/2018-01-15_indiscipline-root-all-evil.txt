Indiscipline, root of all evil

Time is running out! It’s the right moment to think about, and reflect upon, us. We must not forget the fact that our future lies on how fast and how we are going to plan the future. Unfortunately, we are a nation without a vision for the future. Everyone passes the ball to another blaming each one. Is it possible to step into future without any commitment as true patriots?
It is opportune that we must repetitively remember – or be repetitively reminded, rather – the famous maxim of John F Kennedy: Ask not what the country has given to you: Instead ask yourselves what you have given to the country!
The quality of the public life has gone down beyond control. The government is working on a proper plan to improve the quality of the public transport system in order to ease down the traffic-congested roads. It is revealed that about 52 percent of the western province population belongs to the category of public commuters either on bus or train. It is some good news that the authorities have at least decided to address the grass-roots level concerns such as solving the traffic congestion on the road.
Road discipline
In the meantime, the government shall not forget law enforcement. That should be another priority. Although the commuters are entitled to a valid bus ticket, they are sadly deprived of that right in the broad daylight. The law enforcement should not be confined to such broad daylight robberies, but also expanded to motorists on the roads. It is another priority.
The average Sri Lankan motorist is clueless about road discipline. They are in a big rush, for one. All the motorists are trying to bypass each other by overtaking on each other. The vehicle queues seem ridiculous. The road signs go unnoticed and neglected. All this finally takes a heavy toll on the innocent pedestrians, the majority of whom succumb to death on pedestrian crossings. Needless to explain, though worse still is what the bus drivers are up to. They are entangled in a race rather than commuting the public. Some youths, on the other hand, are testing the acceleration mode of the most modern vehicles only to meet the Waterloo in the end.
The list would go on, but when we will see an end to all this remains the ultimate question. Let me shift from motorists to the pavement hawkers. They are becoming an increasing menace. They seem to have taken it for granted that they reserve every right to acquire every perch of the pavement. Later on, they become victims of some opportunistic politicians and the underworld.
Religious and cultural heritage
Recently we witnessed an event where some pavement hawkers have acquired the backyard of Kuttam Pokuna in the sacred city of Anuradhapura. Did anybody have the slightest idea what this place is at all? They will never ever know the historical and archaeological value of this monument! Or is it simply a scenic value attached to the historic monument?
Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Sigiriya are not meant only for tourism. The authorities must maintain law and discipline to preserve all these historical sites. They must have a plan to give a better understanding of how important these places are to the Sri Lankans. They must have every detail of these national treasures recorded. It only shows the strength of greatness that the Sri Lankans can claim. Everybody should be made aware of that understanding. And let them realize that these are not merely places of religious observations!
The poor people who want to earn a living in and around these places must be educated not to ridicule the scenic value of this ancient civilisation. For that purpose, there should be law and order for the sake of discipline. Our ancestors were quite civilised to create these national treasures for posterity.
Our first priority should be law and order. It’s the need of the hour!
