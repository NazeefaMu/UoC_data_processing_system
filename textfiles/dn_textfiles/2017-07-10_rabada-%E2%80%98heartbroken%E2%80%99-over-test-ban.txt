Rabada ‘heartbroken’ over Test ban

LONDON, Saturday – Kagiso Rabada is “heartbroken” at being banned from next week's second Test against England at Trent Bridge, according to South Africa team-mate Temba Bavuma.
Rabada was suspended after picking up a fourth demerit point for swearing at England's Ben Stokes after he dismissed the all-rounder on the first day of this four-match series at Lord's on Thursday. The fast bowler, one of world cricket's rising stars, was previously given three demerit points for a shove on Sri Lanka's Niroshan Dickwella in a one-day international in Cape Town in February.
“KG (Kagiso) is an emotional character -- he didn't purposely act like that, but he was fully aware of the consequences,” Bavuma told reporters after stumps on Saturday. “He is quite heartbroken, because he feels he has let down the team. But we fully understand it happened in the heat of the moment,” added Bavuma.
England ended the third day of the first Test well-placed at 119 for one in their second innings -- a lead of 216 runs. The diminutive Bavuma, one of several Proteas batsmen to make fifty without going in a first innings total of 361, said he had been ‘sledged’ (subjected to verbal abuse) on the cricket field since he was a schoolboy.
“You don't want it to be completely taken away but you still want the respect of the game to be there,” he added. “A balance needs to be achieved.” - AFP
