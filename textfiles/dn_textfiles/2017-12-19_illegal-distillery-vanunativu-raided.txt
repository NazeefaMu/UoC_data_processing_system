Illegal distillery in Vanunativu raided

After being tipped off by the public, the Vanunativu Police raided a long-standing illegal distillery in the Vavunativu frost area on Sunday, 7 December.
540 litres of Goda, Kasippu, and utensils used were taken into custody, said OIC of the Vavunativu Police N.T. Nazeer. He further said that efforts are being made to wipe out the Kasippu business from this most poverty stricken region of Batticaloa.
The three persons involving this business have escaped and the Vavunativu Police officers are making efforts to apprehend them.
