Ranil Wickremesinghe: Revolutionary architect of  modern Sri Lanka

On his State tour to Australia in February this year, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was honoured by Deakin University with an honourary doctorate at the graduation ceremony held on the Geelong Waterfront Campus.
Although honoured with a doctorate, Premier instructed his staff never to use the tag Dr before his name. That shows the man and his character. It firmly affirms that he is a ‘No Show Man’.
In his address at the graduation ceremony, he told the crowd of Deakin alumni and their families to be persistent in the current climate of technological change.
“Start as a follower. Always be humble and learn from the others, especially from the mistakes. Be prepared to lose. In life, you face both success and disaster. Learn to face these setbacks.”
According to the Deakin spokesperson, Premier Wickremesinghe was honoured for modernising laws and legal institutions to drive foreign investment in Sri Lanka.
One of the most seasoned politicians in Sri Lanka today, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe holds the office for the fourth time. He is hailed as the pioneering figure of modern Sri Lanka with a new political culture.
He took the courageous decision to work with President Maithripala Sirisena. He had sincere desire to resolve many issues. By doing so, he had set an example by encouraging the countries that face similar situations.
The world leaders have expressed their appreciation for showing positive signs in resolving the issues, which the world might term as ‘impossible’ by taking ‘the other option’ against all odds and working out methodically and intelligently ‘putting the country before the self’ or ‘preference for the country’ in other words.
In fact, the United Nations has praised Sri Lanka's new government for speeding up efforts towards reconciliation with the ethnic minority, Tamils.
Samantha Power, the US Permanent Representative to the United Nations who visited Sri Lanka in November last year, said that the UN recognized the commitment of the Sri Lanka Government shown for reconciliation with the steps taken towards returning the land to rightful owners, efforts making to find people gone missing, in terms of Prevention of Terrorism, and implementation of accountability.
While the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) leader Maithripala Sirisena gives leadership in running the affairs of the country, UNF Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe, as promised at the election rallies to form an All Party Government, joined the President without any hesitation and formed the Good Governance Government now in operation. This he did although he could have easily formed a pure UNF Government with the help of a few other MPs.
Presidential Election
Ranil Wickremesinghe is a gentleman in the true sense of the word. He willingly sacrificed positions that could have been his own. He gave way to Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka to run for the 2010 Presidential Election and to the former Health Minister of the UPFA Government Maithripala Sirisena who came forward to the 2015 Presidential Election. This was his positive response to the advice he received from the Maha Sangha. He was not selfish.
Although he was castigated by his rivals with that mud-slinging slogan ‘Ranil is incapable’, he did not go to that low level to attack his opponents by casting aspersion or to shout back, at them. He did not fall into that low level. His unruffled behaviour, being, very calm and quiet, and the way he acts, manifested well his maturity and also very much proved the saying that ‘people aim and hit the tree bearing fruits.’
He had shown the signs of a good leader. He had the patience to bear in silence all that said to provoke him.
Reading through the events that had gone by, he underscored the importance of running an all-party Government. That was why he told the constituents at each political rally that he needs to form an all-party Government.
Giving his first interview to The Hindu newspaper immediately after assuming Premiership, Wickremesinghe said: “We have tremendous issues to resolve, more than our personal political rivalries. We will first have to get the country moving -- that's the priority.”
Actions taken by the Government in resolving issues prove that what was said in the interview were not mere words but words brimming with motivation and action.
The United National Party and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party are the two major political parties come together to form the government of Good Governance, although the duo fought from the rival camps to gain the power to govern the country.
With the final results of the 2015 General Election were out, paving the way for the UNF to form the next government, UNF Leader Wickremesinghe moved by the genuine desire to resolve the divergent issues pestering the country for decades invited non-member political parties of the UNF, to put away all differences and join the Government for the sake of the country.
The signing of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the two major political parties in the country took the world by surprise and today the concept of Good Governance is moving as a reality, towards achieving the goals the parties in the UNITY GOVERNMENT agreed upon to achieve.
Good Governance Government
The rival parties, opposed to this ‘unity government’, are hell-bound to break the unity. They want to create chaos in the country. They try all their tricks to create fractions within the rank and file of the ‘Unity Government’, knowing well that their future is doomed, if the Good Governance Government were to continue. They fear that their evil hopes and aspirations would be shattered and the end results would be most critical, unpredictable and unimaginable. So they keep on trying.
Ranil Wickremesinghe served the country as Prime Minister from 1993 to 1994 being appointed to succeed Prime Minister D B Wijetunga who assumed duties as the Executive President of Sri Lanka after the assassination of Ranasinghe Premadasa on May 1, 1993.
Winning the General Election held in the year 2001, as the UNP leader, he formed the United National Front Government and served the country as the Prime Minister for the second time, from 2001 to 2004. The country was governed by President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga.
With the successful conclusion of the Presidential Election on January 8, 2015, the Opposition Common Candidate Maithripala Sirisena was elected as the Executive President of this country with the UNP backing. Immediately after taking his oath, before the Chief Justice K Sri Pavan, the UNF Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe was sworn in as Prime Minister for the Third Time, being appointed by President Maithripala Sirisena.
During his interview with NDTV, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said that the Unity Government was in agreement in principle to abolish the Executive Presidency and to fully implement the 13th Amendment to the Sri Lanka Constitution, to resolve the ethnic issue which had eaten into the very fabric of society.
Born on March 24, 1949, just one year after Sri Lanka gained independence from the British Empire, Wickremesinghe, is truly a leader of the new independent era. He, a lawyer by profession, was elected at the age of 28, to the Sri Lanka Parliament at the year 1977 General Election, as the UNP Member for Biyagama Electorate, in the Gampaha District of the Western Province.
