Live the song

Priya Peiris needs hardly any introduction among music fans of the sixties. Famed for ‘cock-a-doodle-doo’, Priya Peiris came long journey in music career. La Bambas music troupe, founded by him made waves in music of the sixties. Retired from government service, Priya Peiris is yet to bid farewell to his beloved subject: music.
Q: So, you will be celebrating half century with La Bambas group?
A: Yes, we started it in 1966. In 2016, however we have no big plans. We will be launching a CD.
Q: You have mentioned that there is a remarkable difference in music and instruments of your group.
A: We will never go to electronic guitars though it is electronic era. It is only box guitars, shakers and another a set of clappers which give (tuck tuck) sound synchronizing. This particular CD comprises many Latin American, Calipso, Cowboy, Spanish and a few other songs of different languages. For English and Sinhala songs, we make our own lyrics to suit our own music. Foreign songs include ‘La Paloma', 'Cielito lindo' , 'El Rancho grande', 'Sol a mente una vez', 'Pepito mi corazon’, 'MI cafetal’, 'El bayon' (theme song from the 1953 movie Anna)', 'Yo vendo unos ojos negros', 'Nube Gris' , 'Las Mananitas', ‘Adios Mariquita Linda' and Calypsos such as 'Melody d' amor' and English numbers are 'Sloop John B', 'Yellow Bird', 'River of the roses', 'Sweet Rosy Ann' along with a few English originals.
Q: You initiated your career at Radio Ceylon. How did it influence you?
A: First it was Radio Club. Vijeya Corea and I were the first to play to DX TV. We were a group. We were the only group that entertained the wounded soldiers at the Army Hospital during the period of ethnic conflict in 1980s.
I was a Thomian. When the seniors were singing in the church choir we little ones were made to sit in the front when they harmonized. I copied the style, then the teachers later made me join the harmonizing group whom were really honored by the whole school as only few could harmonize and I was one of them.
Q: Your group was quite popular in the sixties and it increased when you sang Cock-a-Doodle-Doo.
A: We were nicknamed as cock-a-doodle boys. Unlike other groups, we never had bookings. We were invited to sing at cocktail parties and functions in many Embassies, as we were singing songs in 15 languages! We signed a contract with Hotel Oberoi for 15 long years! The foreigners were really impressed. My song Cock-a-Doodle was a great hit in 1960s.
Q: Along with that fame, you must have unforgettable memories too?
A: Yes. We used to go to camps in Northern and Eastern Provinces during the Ethnic conflicts to offer entertainment to the gloomy solders. We travelled there and started training them to sing, play instruments. It was a great pleasure.
Q: Do you still have the old records?
A: We have records of all our songs sung at that time which were recorded by Paradise Record Bar, Philip, Suriya and Mc Clarence. At that time there were no CDs. There were only records. ‘Lak Nadee’, ‘Enna Yanna Nelum Vile Nelum Kadanna’, ‘Kurulan Piyambala’ and many more which became great hits.
