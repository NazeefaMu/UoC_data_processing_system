SLIBFI conference  on July 18 at Ramada

The Sri Lanka IBF Industry Conference (SLIBFI X) will be held for the 10th consecutive year on July 18, 2018 at the Ramada Colombo Hotel.
The 10th installment of any event evokes many a sentiment, ranging from a sense of nostalgia to a feeling of accomplishment in being an integral part of a key industry event that encapsulates the various stakeholders at a single forum and in an unbroken sequence straddling a decade. Whilst challenges abound, it is heartening to note that the industry continues to attract new players.
The robust performance of some of the players that entered the industry over the past few years is a significant contributory factor to attracting new players, thus enhancing the lustre of an industry that has undoubtedly captured the attention of nearly all the institutions that constitute the financial industry in Sri Lanka, not just from Banking but also from the NBFI, Insurance and Capital Markets segments.
Aptly titled “SLIBFI X”, given the 10th anniversary of the event, the Conference will focus primarily on an aspect that seem to have been forgotten in an era of phenomenal growth of the overall industry; Creating an impact on Society.
The Conference Plenary Sessions will include a CEO Roundtable, a presentation on Takaful as well as a discussion on Cryptocurrencies but the overriding theme would be Social Impact Investing.In fact, a new venture to focus on assisting the lesser fortunate is expected to be announced during the course of the day.
Post-Lunch, the Technical Sessions, hosted by Adl Capital Ltd, will cover Islamic Credit Cards, Wakalah, Islamic Overdrafts and the Impact on the New Tax Laws on the IBF industry.
The speakers at the various sessions will straddle many facets of the IBF Industry.
The keynote address will be delivered by Reyaz Mihular, Managing Partner, KPMG whilst the CEO panel will include Mohamed Azmeer of Amana Bank, Fazal Ghaffoor of Amana Takaful, Krishan Thilakaratne, of Commercial Leasing & Finance & Ishrat Rauff of Adl Capital. Mafaz Ishaq, Shiraz Sideek, Suresh Perera, Fouzul Hameed, Sheikh Ahmed Umar Yoosuf, Sabri Abdul Cader, Siddeeque Akbar, Azad Zaheed, Imran Nafeer, Ash Sheikh Zaid Nooramith, and Yahya Ilham are some of the other distinguished speakers who will feature in the day’s proceedings.
The event is organized by UTO EduConsult (Pvt) with KPMG and Adl Capital playing pivotal roles.
