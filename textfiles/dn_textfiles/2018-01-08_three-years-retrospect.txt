THREE YEARS IN RETROSPECT

Three years in power is sufficient time for a government to convincingly demonstrate that it has justified the trust the electors in the country have placed in it.
Let us go by the yardstick that the ordinary people would use for assessing the performance of the government they have elected. They would consider whether the government has made a genuine effort to improve their lot and also whether it has fulfilled the pledges its leaders made when they sought the people’s mandate or how far they have succeeded in honouring the pledges.
Ven. Maduluvave Sobitha thera
It is already part of history that it was a vibrant popular movement calling for an administration committed to upholding social justice and the basics of democratic governance, not the run-of-the-mill issues like the high cost of living, nor the esoteric issues such safeguarding the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country and its image in the eyes of the international community that paved the way for a regime change in this country in 2014 and 2015.
The movement for social justice and democratic governance was the upshot of a desperate cry out for a political change by a large section of the populace who had grown sick of the despotic regime in power at the time which was steeped in corruption, nepotism and gross abuse of power.
It was a time of anarchy and a de facto rule of a despotic monarchy. It was the era of whitevans; individuals disliked by some elements in the seats of power were abducted and were made to disappear leaving no trace. There were several media personnel among such victims. Some media men who were abducted escaped death, but were maimed for life. Death stared in the face of everyone who was considered anti-government. The judiciary was openly undermined. A Chief Justice was sent home following a Kangaroo court trial. And later she was subjected to ridicule and numerous indignities. It was a well-known secret even the Ministers feared to utter a word against the highest political authority.
It was quite obvious to all that there was no law and order in the country and they were living under a virtual dictatorship. Corruption was rampant from top to bottom. It is in this context that the enlightened public led by a section of the country’s intelligentsia, threw in their lot with the Movement for Social Justice and Good Governance led by the Naga Viharadhipati the late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobhita Nayaka Thera.
There is a general belief among the people that Sri Lanka is a blessed nation and no evil power can last long. True to this belief, a series of events that played out later turned out to be blessings in disguise for the people in the country.
President Mahinda Rajapaksa decided to go in for a midterm Presidential poll. Of course, by then he had prepared the legal ground to seek office for a third term. Then the question of finding an opposition candidate to challenge President Rajapaksa who appeared invincible at the time arose. It was at this critical moment of the country’s history by a strange auspicious turn of its destiny, a Minister of the same government with a clean record of public service and a popular image because of his simple and unassuming ways emerged as the common opposition candidate while the rest is history.
Now let us assess the performance of the National Unity government which came into power on the platform of a democratic governance, going by the yardstick the common man would use.
Civil society activists including the ‘Puravesi Balaya’ played an active role in bringing about change of governance in January 8, 2015.
Has the government made a genuine effort to improve the lot of the common man? Has the common man got a square deal from this government? It is a fact that government has taken a series of measures to lessen the cost of living burden of the people. In fact, shortly after assuming office, the government took the country by surprise by reducing the price of a number of essential consumer items including fuel. We have to take into consideration that the government took the trouble to provide a measure of relief to the ordinary people despite the daunting foreign debt-servicing commitment.
The law and order situation has now come back to normal. People in all walks of life can go about their workaday business sans the fear psychology that plagued them in the recent dark era. The White Van culture is now a thing of the past!
As regards, the pledge made to bring about a new political culture and an era of democratic governance, the government took immediate steps to reduce certain powers of the Executive Presidency which could pose a threat to democratic governance. In fact, President Sirisena himself took pains to ensure the passage of the relevant Constitutional Amendment!
Constitutional Council and the Independent Commissions abolished under the 18th Amendment by the previous regime were also restored under this Constitutional Amendment.
The Right to Information Act was passed to ensure the transparency of the administration.
The media freedom which suffered a heavy toll in the past is now available in full measure. Opposition politicians featuring on State TV programmes and criticizing the government is a common sight nowadays.
The National Unity government strengthened the CIOBAC and set up several investigative agencies like the Presidential Commission to Investigate Bribery and Corruption and the FCID in a bid to bring to book the politicians and the politically associated persons involved in financial crimes. It is obvious that the government is determined to eliminate the corrupt elements within it as well. The Presidential Commission appointed to investigate the Treasury Bond fiasco stands testimony to this fact.
It is true that the government has yet to go a long way in its efforts to raise the quality of the people, upholding social justice and democratic governance in general and eradicating the scourge of corruption from public life for good in particular. None would or could say that the country has an ideal government in power. Of course, there are many shortcomings and acts of commission and omission too which are not uncommon.
In this context, we have to understand that we have got a type of coalition government unprecedented in the country’s political history. Two main rival political parties have come together to raise the country from the morass it has fallen into due to decades of narrow sectarian politics and a host of other reasons. It is obvious that people are looking forward to the success of this new experiment in governance.
