Southern Province hub of educational development in SL - Minister Rasaputhra

Southern Province has presently been the hub of educational development in Sri Lanka. Most of the Southern provincial students have been capable of achieving excellent results in examinations conducted so far by the government, Southern Provincial Education Minister Chandima Rasaputhra said.
He expressed these views addressing as the chief invitee at a felicitation ceremony held in honour of the recently retired principal Ven. Bengamuwe Wimala Thera of the Thihagoda Junior School.
There are some politicians who are inciting acts of thuggery and violence to gain their political objectives. As a veteran and experienced politician he would never resort to such acts of violence. The voters should be allowed to decide future destiny of the politician based on people friendly services rendered by him, Minister Rasaputhra said.
It is hardly possible to run a school satisfying politicians, parents and all others. It is also difficult for a Buddhist monk with abundant sense of loving kindness and compassion to carry out the duties of a proper school administrator. Ven. Bengamuwe Wimala Thera was appointed principal of this school by him. The principal Thera maintained a proper discipline and administration in this school to the best of satisfaction of all, Minister Rasaputhra said.
Minister Chandima Rasaputhra said that there is an excess of teachers in some schools while some other schools in remote rural areas in the region have a shortage of teaching staff.
In spite of all these obstacles he expressed his deep sense of gratitude to both teachers and students for making better academic achievements, so as to bring honour to the Southern Province in Sri Lanka.
A recent survey carried out in South has revealed that the lack of a proper and healthy atmosphere for children in view of want of parental protection, poverty and disruptions of families led to a decrease in examination results of some children in certain schools.
SPC Education Ministry is also exploring the possibility of avoiding all these hassles and affected children be admitted to children’s homes and afford them a quality education. Advanced countries in the world have adopted these strategies, he said. He said, children are the asset of the country. Financial allocations making for them would not be an invaluable investment to mold a brighter future for them. It is not a waste of money but a valuable investment. Affording a sound education to every child in the Southern region would be the cherished aim of his ministry.
He said, in the national educational development process, the study of Engineering Technology has been prioritized. Proper facilities have to be provided for students to study these subjects, Minister Chandima Rasaputhra added.
Plans are afoot to further boost the academic attainments and examination results of all students in state schools in the Southern Province. Speedy measures have also been initiated to enhance the physical and human resources in affected schools in the Southern province, he said.
The educational development of the children would be the vision and mission of the SPC Education Ministry, he further added. Retired principal Ven. Bengamuwe Wimala Thera and several higher education officials also addressed the meeting.
