Jamaldeen retains top Rugby Referees’ position

The Sri Lanka Rugby Referees Society 60th Annual General Meeting took place on Saturday morning at OPA. Former Sri Lanka and Police Sports Club rugby skipper Nizam Jamaldeen who was a top rugby referee was elected as president for the fourth consecutive year.
Jamaldeen has a good knowledge in the rugby field. While playing for Police SC he established a record by scoring 248 points in a season. He was Sri Lanka’s most dependable place kicker.
Jamal as he is popularly known said, “During my playing days the game was played with passion and high spirit whereas nowadays players are more interested in commercial benefits.”
A product of Isipathana College, he played for CR & FC, Police SC and Sri Lanka as a fly half in a glittering rugby career that spanned almost two decades. He holds the rare feat of representing the country at five Rugby Asiads, four Dubai 7s, three Hong Kong 7s, a World Cup 7s in Italy and a few more Sevens tournaments in Singapore, Malaysia and China.
The former star player turned rugby referee and coach feels the level of playing during the 1990s and the present is vastly different. In 1992 he broke the record held by Kandy product Charles Wijewardene. At present Nizam Jamaldeen is an assistant superindent of Police.
The vice presidents are two top class referees with years of experience S.W. Chang and Aruna Rankothge, Dinka Peries who did a good job as secretary last year is once again the secretary, Sharath Fernando is the treasurer. The past committee members are: Tony Amith and Roshan Deen. The committee comprises Gamini Indrasena, Madawa Wijesiri, Pradeep Fernando and Gerald Rasiah.
