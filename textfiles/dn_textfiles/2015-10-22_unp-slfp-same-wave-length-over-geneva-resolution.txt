UNP, SLFP on same wave length over Geneva resolution

Sri Lanka Freedom Party Spokesman Minister Dilan Perera said both the United National Party and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party taking a common stance on the human rights topic are of the view that the Geneva recommendations are more favourable to Sri Lanka.
He added that although several people make a hue and cry about a hybrid court and mediation of foreign judges, the Geneva recommendation do not suggest establishing hybrid courts or appointing foreign judges to look into human right allegations.
"It was during the time of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, that certain Ministers expressed their concern about establishing hybrid courts and appointing foreign judges to look into human rights violations. 'Darusman', who presented a report on human right violations, was not a Sri Lankan. He came to the country during Rajapaksa's rule " he noted. The Minister said so addressing the media yesterday at the SriLanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Headquarters participating in the SLFP weekly media briefing.
In accordance with the Constitution of the country only lawyers, who have passed the Law College final examination can be a judge. Therefore, no international judge can be a judge in the country unless after becoming a lawyer on passing the Law College Examination even though there is room for such international judges to assist local investigations into the human right violations. Moreover, such international judges can be observers or provide technical assistance to the process. He added that President Sirisena had multiparty and multi ethnic discussions yesterday (22) evening aimed at reaching a common stance on the Geneva recommendations. "All the views of participants including politicians, intellectuals,media personnel, religious leaders etc. were considered aiming to have a proper and most suitable common stance" he noted.
Minister Perera while appreciating the stance of the JVP on the Geneva proposals, said the JVP should not arouse communism like in the past. However the leftist parties including Prof. Tissa Vitarana, DEW Gunasekara aretaking a communal line in regard to the Geneva proposals. "This is the last bus. It is the duty of we all to make use of this opportunity," he added.
