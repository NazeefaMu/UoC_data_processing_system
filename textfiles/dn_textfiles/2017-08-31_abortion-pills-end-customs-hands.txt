Abortion pills end in Customs hands

An Indian passenger who tried to smuggle in 16,930 abortion pills valued at Rs 2.3 million hidden inside his travel bags in a SriLankan Airlines flight from New Delhi was nabbed at the Katunayake Airport by Airport Customs on August 29.
Investigations revealed that the 32 year old Indian resident from Uttar Pradesh had planned to hand over the pills to a person in Colombo, Deputy Customs Director Parakrama Basnayake said. A fine of Rs 100,000 was imposed on him and the pills were confiscated.
