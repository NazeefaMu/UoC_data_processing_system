Moragahakanda - Kaluganga project: Water filling ceremony on July 23

The Moragahakanda - Kaluganga project will turn a new leaf in the country’s development history though the government had been failed to market it, unlike the previous government, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said yesterday.
The Minister made this observation yesterday during the press conference held to announce the water filling ceremony of the Kaluganga reservoir on July 23, to be held under the the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena.
He said parallel to this project, the construction of the Moragahakanda-Kaluganga tunnel will begin the same day. Power generated by the Moragahakanda project would be connected to the national grid.
“This is some kind of a miracle,” Minister Amaraweera said. “This project was initiated during the 1994-2000 period when President Maithripala Sirisena was the Mahaweli Minister. The entire project is Rs 230,000 million while the Kaluganga project is Rs 101,120 million.”
Minister Amaraweera said the project loan could be settled with the profit accrued.This project would create thousands of employment opportunities in the country.The fisheries industry, agriculture and the power generation could save immensely for the country, he said.
He said compensation and two acres was offered for those who lost their lands due to the implementation of this project.Towns are being set up with modern hospital, school, shopping complex for the people who have been resettled.The people would also get quality drinking water and it is a great solace to them since they come from an area where the kidney disease was rampant.
The people will also be provided with water for both the seasons and for cultivation in between.
Minister Amaraweera further said the country imports 44,000 metric tonnes of fruits, ginger and turmeric worth of Rs 1,315 million, oranges worth of Rs. 158 million, cashew worth of Rs 750 million and peanuts worth of Rs 680 million.”Farmers can cultivate them there saving the money that flows out of the country,” Minister said.
