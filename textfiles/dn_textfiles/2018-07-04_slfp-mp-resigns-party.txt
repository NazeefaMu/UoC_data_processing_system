SLFP MP resigns from party

Kurunegala District Parliamentarian Tharanath Basnayake has decided to resign from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party Central Committee.
He decided to resign from the Central Committee as he is not satisfied with the reforms activities in the party
“I will inform the party about my decision in writing within a few days,” he said. Basnayake said that he has already decided to support the Joint Opposition led by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
He was of the view that the SLFP cannot be put on the right path as long as the party remains with the United National Party.
