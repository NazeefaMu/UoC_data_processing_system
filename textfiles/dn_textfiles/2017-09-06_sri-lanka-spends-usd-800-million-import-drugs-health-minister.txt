Sri Lanka spends USD 800 million to import drugs: Health Minister

 
Currently the Sri Lankan Government spends USD 800 million to import drugs, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said.
He said this while addressing the Amapara District Summit of the All Island Private Pharmacy Owners Association held recently.  
Minister Senaratne added that the registration fee for new pharmacies was increased after 10 years.
‘but now the fee is reduced to Rs. 7500 as requested by the All Island Private Pharmacy Owners Association’ the Minister said.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that the commission given for the pharmacies for selling 114 drugs from the State Pharmaceuticals Corporation (SPC) has been increased from 15 percent to 18 percent.
Reducing the prices of 48 drugs is a huge loss for pharmacy owners but it benefits for 20 million people in the country, he said.
The Health Ministry has also taken several other steps to offer relief for patients, such as offering free eye lenses, stents, free cancer drugs for lifetime, free blood testing etc.
