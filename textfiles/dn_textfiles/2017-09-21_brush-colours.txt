A brush with colours

Her ability to unleash her creative streak by putting her brush to paper has won her recognition and international accolades. Budding young artist, Ishani Vidurangana has made a significant impact in the art field through her innate talent.
Though she can paint with many types of media, Ishani says that she uses fabric paint for her paintings. She stresses that this is purely because fabric painting gives her art a good finish which is especially important when sending one of her works abroad to be judged at a competition.
“For example if you choose to do your art using pastels the colours usually rub off on any surface that the painting touches. This also gives it a messy kind of look which will not go down well with the judges,” she explained.
A student of Lindsay Balika Vidyalaya, Bambalapitiya, Ishani has shown a flair for art from a young age. It was her parents, especially her mother, who had noticed the talent of the young girl and had encouraged her to pursue her passion. She introduced Ishani to art guru S Bogahawatte’s Sampath Rekha International Art Academy when she was in grade five.
“My mother, W G Wasantha Chandrakanthi, has done art as a subject in her school days. She noticed that I was able to look at a drawing and copy it in the exact manner. My elder sister used to show such drawings to my mother and she was amazed with my talent. She even placed one of my drawings on top of the original once to see if I had traced the drawing. Then she realized that it was not done in that manner but that I had drawn it simply by looking at it,” Ishani said.
Bogahawatte observed that the young lass excelled in painting nature and design related topics. He had guided her towards that route. He advised that she should try her hand at painting whatever comes into her mind rather than copying other drawings. The academy even encouraged her to aim high and take part in international art competitions.
Ishani says that she has topped most of the art competitions held by her school. However the first art competition she has taken part in was an international art contest held by Japan. Since there was no topic given for the event Ishani had drawn a picture of a child bathing in the rain near a water pipe.
“They were thrilled with the drawing and gave it a title as well. I won a Platinum Award for that drawing,” she recalled.
Her most significant achievement is probably winning the Golden Brush award at the Children’s Art Studio St Cyril and Methodius art competition held by Macedonia in 2014. She has also clinched accolades at The Seventh International Children’s Painting Exhibition held by the Keisho Art Association in 2013, drawing under the topic ‘Looking Out at the Future’. Ishani has taken part several times in the ‘Look and Learn’ art competition held online by England. The monthly event is open to all young artists across the world. It gives a topic for the artists to paint on at each competition. Ishani won second place several times and got a credit award at the event.
The 17 year old has taken part in several national art competitions too. She has won a merit award at the State Children’s Art Competition (primary section) in 2012. She has clinched a Bronze Award at the Dream Car Art Competition organized by Toyota Lanka Pvt Ltd in 2013. She has won a certificate of recognition at the UN Volunteers art competition drawing under the topic ‘Volunteering for Water’ in 2012.
“An artist needs a lot of patience to get each stroke right. He or she needs to be creative as well because many of the international art competitions provide topics for artists to draw on. Therefore, the artist needs to put his or her thinking cap on and come up with a unique drawing which will catch the eyes of the judges not only for the beauty of the drawing but for its innovative outlook too,” Ishani said adding that if a drawing is almost a duplicate of another’s drawing, then that will act as a minus point.
“I love drawing lotus flowers. Drawings related to religion and scenic backgrounds too are some of my favourite topics. Since I love capturing nature in my drawings, I spend time studying nature whenever I get the opportunity. For example I might perceive birds and then if I come across a particularly striking pose, I capture that in one of my drawings later,” she noted adding that this is her formula of success.
Queried on what she would draw if she is given a topic on the spot Ishani notes that she will draw a pond full of lotus flowers.
“Each and every flower and leaf will have its own unique structure. You need not come up with complicated topics if you are asked to present a drawing for a competition. Mother Nature has given each and every aspect its own novel touch. Therefore, there is simplicity, exclusiveness and beauty in everything. You just need to capture this with your brush and bring it onto canvas,” she opined adding that a drawing related to lotus flowers is usually a hit at international art competitions because the judges consider lotus flowers as a species with a special connection to Sri Lanka.
Ishani comes from a family of five. Her father, Eranda Tilak Dissanayake, is working in the army. Her mother, W G Wasantha Chandrakanthi, is a house wife. Ishani’s sister, Ruksani Viduranga, has just completed her studies. Her brother, Dhanushka Madhuranga, is employed.
Besides painting Ishani is also a talented actress. She has acted in several school plays and also portrayed roles in several films like ‘Sinhaya’, ‘Vijaya Kuveni’ and ‘Punchi Apith Dan Baya Naa’.
“Parents need to identify their children’s talents at a young age and encourage them to brush up their skills. This will be a bonus point for them and benefit them in their studies. I wish to become a professional artist some day. My aim is t get into the graphic sector and make a living using my talents and passion,” Ishani concluded with a smile.
