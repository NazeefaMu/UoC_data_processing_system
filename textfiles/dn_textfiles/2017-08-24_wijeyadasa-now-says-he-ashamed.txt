Wijeyadasa now says he is ashamed

Justice and Buddhasasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said he was charged of breaching Cabinet responsibility, after he said the Hambantota Port agreement is a violation of country’s Constitution.
He stressed that Cabinet of Ministers have collectively violated the country’s Constitution by leasing out the Hambantota Port to a third party.
Rajapakshe addressing the media at the Buddhasasana Ministry soon after he was removed from his portfolios said the Government has begun selling national assets for a song and he does not want to be in such a government. “It is a shame for me to be in a government which is bent on selling public assets”, he said. Rajapakshe added that the mastermind behind the Central Bank bond scam is coming to light as a Presidential Commission was appointed by the President unexpectedly.
