Shades and patterns

A special edition of the The Kingsbury High Tea fashion show featuring an impressive collection by Double XL was held on December at The Gourmet Station. The collection featured some stunning designs which will be available in the stores. The event received a great turn out as the high tea buffet at The Kingsbury delivered great flavours and variety.
