SLto get back GSP Plus: EDB

Sri Lanka will be given back GSP Plus by May or June. The Export Development Board (EDB) is now in the process of making necessary arrangements for the exporters to supply their production without any delay or trouble once the GSP Plus is back, Chairman and Chief Executive of the EDB Ms. Indira Malwatte said.
Addressing media briefing after opening the new `EDB Info Point' with touch screen at the EDB in Colombo yesterday, she said the Government is working hard on getting GSL Plus back and had already submitted all required documents. The GSP Plus would open up a huge market for Sri Lanka with concessionary rates. Therefore, we are confident that Sri Lanka would get GSP Plus back in another four or five months, she said.
According to Ms. Malwatte, the EDB is working with the small and medium scale garment exporters to upgrade their technology, quality, etc. They will be ready to export their production once the GSP Plus is back. It is possible to export quality Sri Lankan garments to India and China, after signing the Free Trade Agreements (FTA). It is a significant increase of Sri Lankan exports. FTA is to be signed with Singapore too.
The self service interactive information KIOSK would facilitate walk in visitors to obtain information of the EDB services promptly, before meeting an official. The service is available from 8.00 am o 6.00 pm during working days at the NDB - EDB Tower, Ground Floor. The new system provides real time error free data, she said.
