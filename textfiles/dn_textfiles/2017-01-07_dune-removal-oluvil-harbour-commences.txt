Dune removal at Oluvil harbour commences

The Ceylon Fishery Harbours Corporation commenced the dune removal programme at the Oluvil Fisheries Harbour and commercial harbour area by ‘Sayaaru’ grab hopper dredger ship recently.
Rs. 40 million was allocated for this by Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Ministry. Ports, Shipping and Aviation Minister Arjuna Ranatunga and Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera took action on this matter at the request of City Planning, Water Supply and Drainage Minister Rauff Hakeem and Deputy Sports Minister H.M.M. Harees. The Oluvil fisheries harbour main entrance has a sand dune which affect the fishing industry badly since fishing boats cannot come or go out for fishing. The affected fishermen met the Deputy Sports Minister H.M.M.Harees and requested him to take action to remove the dune.
He has brought this to the notice of parliament and Ports, Shipping and Aviation Minister Arjuna Ranatunga.
The Ceylon Fishery Harbours Corporation Sailer W.D.F.Fernando recently visited Oluvil Fisheries Harbour and the Commercial Harbour area and had discussed the issue.
