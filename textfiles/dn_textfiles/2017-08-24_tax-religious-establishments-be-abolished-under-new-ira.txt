Tax on religious establishments to be abolished under new IRA

 
Tax on religious establishments will be abolished under the new Inland Revenue Act (IRA), State Minister of Finance Ministry Eran Wickramaratne said today at a press conference held in Colombo.
The new IRA was adopted by Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera to simplify the tax system in order to create an investor friendly environment.
