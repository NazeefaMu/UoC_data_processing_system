Sigiriya infrastructure to be developed

The Central Cultural Fund has taken steps to develop the sanitary facilities at the Sigiriya archaeological site to uplift infrastructure facilities at the site, Sigiriya Cultural Triangle Project Manager said.
Accordingly, two latrine complexes are to be constructed near the Moragahamula vehicle park and in front of the western gate at the site with a cost of Rs. 42 million.
The Moragahamula latrine complex includes 50 cubicles and will be open for the use of foreign tourists. All facilities are to be included in the complex. The latrine complex for local tourists will be constructed in front of the western gate of the Sigiriya archaeological site.
A total of 31 cubicles are to be added while the old latrine complex which is in the same location, will be completely renovated.
In addition, a restroom and a restaurant will be constructed at the site for drivers and travel agents who accompany tourists.
Preliminary work in this regard is in progress, the project manager added.
