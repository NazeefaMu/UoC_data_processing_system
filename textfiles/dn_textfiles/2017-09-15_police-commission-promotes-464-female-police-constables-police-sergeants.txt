Police Commission promotes 464 female police constables to police sergeants

 
The National Police Commission has approved the promotions of 464 female police constables to the position of police sergeants.
Their decision has been communicated to IGP Pujith Jayasundera, said the Police Media Unit today.
The promotions are part of the decision taken by the Commission to resolve the long delays in promotions faced by the Police Department.
Last week the Commission granted promotions to over 2500 policemen whose promotions had been delayed for a very long time.
