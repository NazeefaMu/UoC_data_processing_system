Corruption case against Laksala ex-chairman fixed for trial

A corruption case filed against Sri Lanka Handicrafts Board former chairman Anil Koswatte and three others was yesterday fixed for trial by the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court.
This is for allegedly causing unlawful loss to the government when awarding a contract to a private company to build a new showroom at the National Museum premises, contrary to the accepted tender procedure. Sri Lanka Handicrafts Board former chairman Anil Koswatte was permitted to go abroad. Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara fixed the case for trial on June 29. The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed this case against former DLB chairman under Section 70 of the Bribery Act.
The Bribery Commission further alleged that the accused have committed this offence on or around October 12, 2011 in violation of the law.
