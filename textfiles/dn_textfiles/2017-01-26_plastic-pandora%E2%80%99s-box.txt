Plastic Pandora’s Box

The global narrative on plastic is well known at this point: thousands of tonnes of plastic debris end up in the oceans and languish for hundreds, if not thousands, of years in landfills the world over. The Great Pacific garbage patch, an island composed mostly of plastic, is about the size of India, Europe, and Mexico combined, and approximately six times more plastic trash than plankton is in the North Pacific Ocean.
Plastic bags, containers, and bottles litter the streets of cities everywhere, and the problem seems to be getting worse, as more countries churn out plastic products because of their relative inexpensiveness.
Plastic is also a petroleum product, and about 8 percent of the world’s oil production goes toward manufacturing it. There is also evidence that plastic can adversely affect the quality of ground and drinking water.
While the environmental hazards of plastic are known and well chronicled, its effects on human health are less notorious.
With the hope of raising the public’s awareness of the health hazards of plastic, Believers in Glass, a movement linked with Piramal Glass Ceylon PLC, recently held a press conference in Colombo. A panel of doctors spent the morning sharing details of the frightening evidence that exposure to chemicals in plastics is linked to wide-ranging diseases and disorders, such as cancers, infertility, diabetes, asthma, and kidney disease.
Endocrine disruptors
One of the panel’s main areas of focus was the potential for plastics to leach the toxic chemicals bisphenol A (BPA), styrene, and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) when they are heated, worn down, or put under pressure.


Once these chemicals leach out from the plastic and into drinks, medicines, and food products, they can easily make their way into the body’s systems and wreak havoc on the endocrine system, which is responsible for producing and maintaining hormones.
“Chemicals from plastic are inside of us and are present in blood and urine in measurable amounts,” Dr. Mamta Jain, the event’s moderator, said.
The plastic chemicals can act as various hormon
es in the body, making them endocrine disruptors. “Metabolism, growth, development, organisation, sexual function, and even our mood, are affected to a large extent by endocrine hormones. Once these extraneous plastic chemicals, endocrine disruptor chemicals, enter the system, they are not controlled by our normal mechanisms that maintain the hormone balances,” said Prof. Kolitha Sellahewa, Head of the Department of Medicine at the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine. By throwing off the natural hormone balances within people, these plastic chemicals disrupt the normal body processes and can cause the regular hormone levels to increase or decrease.
While this situation might not sound so dire, the doctors explained that these chemicals have been linked with all sorts of diseases and disorders.
“There is strong evidence that endocrine disruptors increase the risk of obesity and asthma. Also, people exposed to the chemicals can develop a resistance to insulin later in life, causing them to develop diabetes,” Sellahewa said.
“With advancing age, women can get breast cancers, and studies have shown that these breast cancer cells proliferate much faster upon exposure to these endocrine disruptor chemicals,” he continued.
Several doctors added that instances of testicular and prostate cancer have been increasing. They insisted that the evidence pointed to environmental factors like exposure to plastic chemicals as a driving force in these increases.
BPA, styrene, and PVC, among substances, have been shown to cause diseases in adults, but they have also been linked to increasing infertility in both men and women.
Infertility
Dr. Suranga Hettipathirana, a consultant obstetrician and gynecologist, shared that the plastic chemicals can damage the genetic material itself within females’ eggs and males’ sper

ms, which leads directly to miscarriage and infertility.
“Females are born with all the eggs they will ever have. Women and girls are getting exposed to these chemicals for their whole lives, which means that their eggs are also being exposed for a long time. So there can be lots of changes in the genes over this period,” he said.
About half of miscarriages, he said, are due to genetic problems within the developing fetus’ DNA. It follows, then, that the changes to genes caused by these chemicals are making the population less fertile. But infertility problems are by no means limited to women, as Hettipathirana said that it is the male partner who is infertile in over 50 percent of couples that see him about having problems conceiving.
“When you look at sperm, they are produced in millions. A small thing, like a problem in the environment, can cause various complications with production. The quality of sperm goes down, whic
h is causing male factor infertility to increase,” he said.
“So many young couples are coming in, and we are finding that the male partner’s sperm counts are low for no obvious reason. I think the chemicals in food and drinking water are playing a 
major role,” said Professor Neville D.. Perera of the Postgraduate Institute of Medicine.
Sellahewa, for his part, described the process by which men are rendered infertile by endocrine disruptors:
“These endocrine disruptor chemicals are toxic to the two kinds of cells in the testes that are responsible for the sperm production and the testosterone production, respectively,” he said.
“There is a very clear link on the toxicity of these chemicals to both kinds of cells. The end result is you get a male with reduced capacity to produce sperms and to produce testosterone, which is the most important male hormone,” he added.
The American Society for Reproductive Medicine and International Federation of Fertility Societies published a joint paper on their findings that endocrine disruptor chemicals cause male infertility through damaging the cells that produce sperm.
Effects on children
The panel made sure to specify that both fetuses and young children are especially vulnerable to damage from these chemicals.
The toxins that a mother consumes, according to the doctors, are easily diffused through the placenta and can be absorbed by the fetus. “Male child can get exposed to harmful levels of these artificial, hormone-like substances which can directly affect his testes. Two risks then follow: One is that his fertility has been negatively effected, and the other one is that he has a higher propensity to get testicular cancer,” said Perera.
Furthermore, fetuses can suffer some degree of genetic damage from these chemicals while in the womb, which leaves them more vulnerable to cancer, asthma, and obesity later in life.
But young children, too, are particularly vulnerable to damage from these chemicals, the doctors said. “I see, as a practicing pediatrician, that a lot of mothers are using plastic feeding bottles for their babies. These are heated and reused, which makes leaching very likely, and I think it’s not very good to be using them,” said Dr. Lakkumar Fernando, President of the Sri Lanka College of Pediatricians.

Plastic dragging wildlife into jeopardy
While various studies have claimed to determine a safe limit of leached plastic chemicals, Fernando contended that no science can reliably determine this limit.
“One of the things the plastic industry says to defend themselves is that there is a permissible amount of leach. Those things are brought to safeguard the industry. Exposure in whatever amount of permissible level also can be harmful,” he said. “We should take measures to protect our babies and avoid exposure in whatever amounts,” he added.
Policy action
Much of the press conference focused on the effects of plastic on human health, but the latter parts of it dealt with prudent policy directives that the panel thought would save lives.
Many countries, predominantly in Europe, have taken action to ban or limit the use of various plastic products, from plastic bags to water tanks. Sri Lanka, however, has not taken any such action.
“I think it would not be a bad idea for the government to take a strong policy to try and altogether ban the infant feeding bottle at least for babies,” Fernando said.
Sellahewa, moreover, called for increased reviews of plastic quality and chemicals: “Is plastic being tested anywhere in the country? If so, where it is? It is a big question.” He also called for the phasing out of PVC water pipes, which many countries have banned, and plastic water tanks. “Earlier there were cement and stainless steel tanks. When the British were here, they used steel tanks. But due to rust, we changed to plastic. These react according to temperature. Plastic tanks should be covered to avoid the sun’s rays,” he said. The doctors and moderators both called on the media to help spread this information, as the average citizen uses a good deal of plastic and does not know about its deleterious effects on human health.
