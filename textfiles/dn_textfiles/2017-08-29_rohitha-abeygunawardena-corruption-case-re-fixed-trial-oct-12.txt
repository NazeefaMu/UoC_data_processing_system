Rohitha Abeygunawardena corruption case re-fixed for trial on Oct. 12

 
A corruption case filed against former Minister Kalutara District MP Rohitha Abeygunawardena for obtaining assets worth Rs.41.1 million was re-fixed for trial on October 12 by the Colombo High Court, today.
Meanwhile, High Court Judge Sampath Wijeratne permitted Rohitha Abeygunawardena to go abroad between September 24 and October 10. 
 At an earlier occasion, the High Court overruled a preliminary objection raised by former Minister against the Bribery Commission's decision to amend the charges.
 The Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed an indictment in the Colombo High Court on two counts against former Minister Rohitha Abeygunawardena for the unlawful acquisition of assets estimated at Rs.41.1 million.
 In his indictment, the Director General of the Bribery Commission alleged that the former Minister had committed this offence by way of undeclared assets in between 2004 to 2006.
 The Director General alleged that the former minister had unlawfully made 66 monitory transactions, constructed a house and purchased a jeep in contravention to the section 23(a) of the Bribery Act.
The Director General further alleged that former Minister Abeygunawardena owned these properties-deems under the provision of the act to be property acquired by bribery.
