Air India to operate Varanasi-Colombo flights for pilgrims

For the first time Air India will commence twice weekly flights beginning on 04 August. This operation will also facilitate the Hindu Pilgrims in their travel to the great city of Varanasi.
The Air India-operated Airbus flight with 172 economy and 12 J Class (semi-luxury) seats will operate between Varanasi and Colombo on Fridays and Sundays.
When Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Sri Lanka to celebrate the Vesak festival, he said that he would request Air India to operate a flight to Varanasi mainly to cater to growing Buddhist travellers.
Varanasi is a major religious hub city and the holiest of the seven sacred cities (saptha puri) in Hinduism and Jainism. Saranath where the Enlightened One, Lord Buddha, gave his first discourse to five ascetics is close by. The city is on the banks of the River Ganges where there are over 87 ghats. The city was also known as Benares. It is said that there are about 23,000 temples in Varanasi.
Varanasi is also a major healthcare city with many hospitals.
The Air India flight will leave Varanasi at 12:35 hours and arrive in Colombo at 15:55 hours and leave Colombo at 16:55 hours and arrive in Varanasi at 20:20 hours.
This schedule would be operating until end November. (SS)
