Wimal Weerawansa betrayed our program and joined Mahinda Rajapaksa: Jayantha Wijesekera

The politburo of the Jathika Nidahas Peramuna had earlier adopted five resolutions. Two of them were to win national independence through a national movement and unite Maithri and Mahinda. But our leader Wimal Weerawansa betrayed our program and joined Mahinda Rajapaksa by going to him on bended knees said SLFP Trincomalee District organiser and former National Freedom Front (Jathika Nidahas Peramuna) Provincial Council Member Jayantha Wijesekara. I decided to leave the party altogether because I could not withstand such envious activities on the part of the party leader,” he said.
Wijesekara was addressing the gathering at a reception accorded him at Kantale town on December 4. Justice and Buddhasasana Deputy Minister Dushmantha Mithrapale presided.
Wijesekara said he was keeping such envious actions perpetrated against the JNP since 2004 in his mind to settle scores whenever Basil visited Trincomalee if he could in the near future.
Wijesekara who said that he received an invitation from Mahinda Rajapaksa to join the ‘Pohottuwa’ party (SLPP) after leaving Maithri's Camp added that he flatly refused the offer saying that Maithri was not a cheat but a genuine and sincere leader who had established national unity by fostering communal amity in the country. I also told him “you are just an ordinary Parliamentarian but Maithripala Sirisena is the Executive President of the Country and you are no where when compared to him.”
Moreover, I told Mahinda that you are a member of a feudal family but Maithri is the son of a real farmer from Polonnaruwa.”
