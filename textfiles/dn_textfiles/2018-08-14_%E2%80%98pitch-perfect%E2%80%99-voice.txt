‘Pitch perfect’ voice

Christina Aguilera has tipped her son to follow her into pop music after hearing him sing a track from her new album Liberation.
In a Twitter Q&A with fans the ‘Genie In A Bottle’ hitmaker, 38, revealed she loves singing with her three-year-old daughter Summer Rain, but recently discovered her 10-year-old Max shares her vocal talent.
“Summer and I stick to our Disney songs together, BUT, my son Max actually has an incredible voice- he doesn’t showcase it a lot- but I caught him singing Maria (a track from the record) the other day, and he was pitch perfect,” she wrote in response to a fan who asked her daughter knew any of her songs.
Tipping her son as a possible future star she added, “He definitely has talent there if he ever wants to do anything with it.”
Max is Christina’s son by her first husband, marketing executive, Jordan Bratman. She is currently engaged to Summer Rain’s dad, Matthew Rutler.
When asked by another fan what the best thing about being a mother is, she replied: “Being able to be a kid again myself, and finding pleasure in small smiles and cozy moments of everyday life.”
Liberation is her first for six years, and when quizzed about her comeback record she hinted the long delay in releasing new material had been due to her unhappiness with the demands of pop stardom.
