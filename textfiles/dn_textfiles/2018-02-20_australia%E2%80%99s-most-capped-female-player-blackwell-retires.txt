Australia’s most-capped female player Blackwell retires

Sydney: Australia’s most-capped female player and vice-captain Alex Blackwell was hailed as a “tremendous leader” in the women’s game after announcing her retirement from international and state cricket on Monday.
Blackwell, 34, made her debut for Australia in a one-day international against England in 2003, and went on to play 251 matches across all three formats for her country. She became the fourth female Australian to pass 5,000 runs when she batted in the Test, Twenty20 and One-Day arenas, compiling 5,250 runs.
“Alex has been a wonderful servant to Australian cricket, and a tremendous leader both at national and international level,” Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland said in a statement. AFP
