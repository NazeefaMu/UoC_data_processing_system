Train derailed at Medawachchiya

Train operations on the Northern lien had to be restricted to Anuradhapura station from midnight on November 14 due to the derailment of Matara-Vavuniya Raja Rata Rajina Express train at Kulikkada Medawachchiya.
Trains Control said more than 100 Sleeping Berths had been damaged due to the derailment of four rear compartments which occurred in between Madawachchiya and Medagama stations.
However commuters en route to Vavuniya had to make private arrangements to proceed up to Vavuniya.
Meanwhile, commuters who had booked seats to travel from Vavuniya to Colombo that night had to face great inconvenience due to the disruption of train traffic. Since they came over to Anuradhapura to board the train to Colombo there was a heavy rush of passengers at the Anuradhapura station.
Railway workers were busy from November 14 night to place the derailed compartments back on rails and repair the track.
