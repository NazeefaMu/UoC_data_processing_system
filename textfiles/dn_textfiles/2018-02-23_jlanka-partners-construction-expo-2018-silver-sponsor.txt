Bringing together suppliers and service organizations in the building, construction, engineering and architecture industry, the “Construction Expo” will be held on June 29, 30 and July 1, 2018 at the BMICH.
Held for the 7th consecutive year, the expo will once again showcase the best of what the industry has to offer. Highlighting the theme “Towards a Green Sri Lanka”, Construction Expo 2018 focuses on the green building evolution that is a fast evolving area of building practice.

Visitors include professionals, key decision makers, buyers, suppliers, traders, distributors and much more.
This year more than 20,000 to 25,000 visitors are expected at the exhibition, this would benefit all stakeholders including contractors, architects, quantity surveyors, engineers and other related parties in the sector.
JLanka join hands with Construction Expo 2018 as a Silver sponsor. Sri Lanka’s strategic geo-political placement in the world map has not yet been capitalized from the industries that country could thrive and position to its full potential by Sri Lankans over the last 70 years since independence, from the colonial rule.
However a relatively young Solar PV system installer which began operations in 2010 is transforming Sri Lanka into a Solar Powered Energy hub with the most number of installed Solar PV Housing units and with the most innovative technologies that cater industrial Solar power requirements.
Sri Lanka’s pioneer and leader in Solar PV Systems and Next Generation Energy Technologies - JLanka Technologies from 2010 to date had installed thousands of solar installations throughout the country. All those Solar PV systems generates over 25MW of electricity, with an annual contribution of 37GWh of energy to the national grid.
Being the premier solar solutions provider in the country with a longstanding reputation for quality and unmatched service in the industry, JLanka Technologies has maintained close trade relationships with global solar industry giants such as Trina Solar, SolarEdge over the last seven years.
JLanka’s commitment to Research and Development on optimizing the home rooftop Solar PV systems in order to maximize Solar Power generation, and intelligent smart Solar Grids, and Energy Management Software and Metering has paved way for many Sri Lankans to consider JLanka Solar PV systems to light their homes and companies
Being a Solar Energy domestic industry giant in a tropical country located close to equator, JLanka also aims to explore the potential of building Solar Energy farms and Solar Plants using the Sunlight that falls in abundance to the Sri Lankan land masses throughout the year.
According to JLanka officials Sri Lanka has a larger potential in the booming solar market and they along with industry partners are committed to help and support with their technologies in providing quality solar products to both households and industrial sectors.
Construction Expo 2018 will be a one of a kind event with almost every stakeholder related to the industry being present. The consumers have grown to look at the exhibition as a “one stop shop’ for all their construction needs and over the years the exhibition has seen thousands of consumers make all purchases, inquiries and other related work during the three days of the show satisfying all their construction related needs under one roof.
A 50-member high-profile delegation, led by the Business Department of Liaoning Province and Shenyang Zhongqiao International Exhibition Co. Ltd, will arrive in Colombo to attend Construction Expo 2018, scheduled to be held at BMICH.
