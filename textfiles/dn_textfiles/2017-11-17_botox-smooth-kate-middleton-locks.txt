Botox for smooth Kate Middleton-like locks

Botox is no longer regarded as the trendy go-to treatment to banish wrinkles. A growing number of women are now turning to have their perfect blow-dries last longer and to stop them from sweating when they hit the gym, the Daily Mail reported.
Demand for the procedure has become so popular that dematalogists are calling the new trend Blotox.
Women reportedly want the treatment to keep their smooth locks intact like Kate Middleton, Duchess of Cambridge.
How does it work? The procedure works by "inhibiting the eccrine glands" as a result the reduced perspiration in the scalp causes less frizz and patients do not have to wash their hair as frequently, the report revealed.
Another reason it is applied on the scalp is to treat extreme sweating. "I have been doing blotox for about eight years," New York dermatologist Dr Michelle Henry told US Weekly. "I had a number of patients that were resistant to working out because they didn't want to ruin their hairstyle or blowout," she explained.
Dr Henry also claims it makes a big difference in the lives of working women who want to look great but who are in a constant rush. The treatment is said to help keep curly or kinky hair straight for longer than usual.
Clinical director Dr David Eccleston, is another doctors who swears by the treatment. "I have been using Botox for 20 years to treat everything from facial wrinkles to underarm sweating and migraine," he told the Daily Mail. Adding, "Botox stops sweating by blocking the nerve impulses to the individual sweat glands. When used in the scalp, sweating is reduced, thus reducing the tendency of straightened hair to return to its curly state."
Currently this new trend has become very popular in the US and UK.
