Sarfraz Ahmed dismisses “Underdogs” tag for Pakistan

Ever since Pakistan managed to defeat India in the Champions Trophy final under the inspiring leadership of Sarfraz Ahmed, their status in the limited overs format has changed drastically.
With the resurgence of players like Mohammad Amir and also some good young talents like Shadab Khan, Fakhar Zaman, they certainly are a strong unit to cope with.
Pakistan, as per the recent schedule released by ICC, will play their opening game of the campaign against the wounded Windies. They’ll combat arch-rivals India at the iconic Old Trafford, Manchester on June 16th.
Speaking to the press, the 30-year-old suggested their team is trying to iron out the few deficiencies in the remaining one year.
“The World Cup is important for all teams. Our first match is against the West Indies. The first match is always important, so all our preparations are geared towards that match and the tournament. We are trying to iron out our deficiencies during this period,” Sarfraz said as quoted by The Express Tribune. Talking about their under-dogs status going into every World Cup, Sarfraz reckons people will remember that they won the Champions Trophy. “Pakistan always go into tournaments as underdogs but I don’t think it will be the same this time because people remember that we have won the Champions Trophy,” he said.
Talking about the importance of World Cup, Sarfraz said that big players are born during such huge tournaments. Pakistan previously won the World Cup in 1992 under the leadership of the legendary Imran Khan.
Later on, they managed to reach the finals once in 1999 and they lost to India in the semifinals in the 2011 edition. He also said that importance of certain players is realized during this tournament.
“The World Cup is one event in which the world is watching you and everyone is following you. The importance of players is realized during this crunch time. The World Cup gives birth to heroes and superstars,” he said.
