Mexico swings Left

Mexico, the country with the Second largest economy in Latin America turned Left last Sunday when Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, affectionately known as ALMO, candidate of the Movement for National Regeneration (Morena Party) won the Presidential election with a huge 53.3 percent of the vote pushing Hose Antonio Meade of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) into Third place with only 15.7 percent. Candidate of the democratic Action Party Ricardo Ana came Second with 23 percent of the vote.
Morena party also won a comfortable majority in both Houses of Parliament – the 328 seat Senate and 500 strong Chamber of Deputies. The new President will assume office on December 1, 2018.
Latin America is a region were election results were swinging from Left to right and vice-versa frequently. Ever since dictatorships propped up and maintained with the sponsorship of Washington were replaced by progressive military or civilian rule some countries have seen the establishment of rightwing conservative governments in several countries such as Brazil, Chile and Columbia. What worries Washington is not so much the victory of AMLO but whether the victory would have a domino effect in the rest of America. We witnessed few weeks ago how the victory of a popular Left candidate was thwarted by unconstitutional means in Uruguay even after announcing his victory.
It was after 70 years that the people of Mexico have been able to defeat conservative parties.
Little over half of Mexico’s 120 million population or 53 percent approximately are poor. Of them 10 million are extremely poor. President-elect Labrador has promised to implement a programme different from the neo-liberal project undertaken so far with a particular pro-poor focus.
President Trump has congratulated the new President and expressed his wish to work together. These sentiments were reciprocated by Labrador also. However, relations between the two countries were beset with many problems. For example, the United States has an adverse trade balance with Mexico. Last year Mexico exported US $ 340 billion worth goods to the US while it imported only goods worth US $ 236 billion. Besides, President Trump wants to revise NAFTA or withdraw from it. Also he has a plan to build a wall along the Mexican border and charge Mexico part of the cost of construction, a proposition which Mexico has rejected.
Drug trafficking and crime are two serious problems remaining to be solved. President Labrador looks at the poor who deal in trafficking with sympathy while fighting the criminal Drug Lords who have private armies and terrorize the population and government officials. Since 2006 there were 200,000 homicides and over 159,000 involuntary disappearances in Mexico. There were 25,000 homicides last year alone.
The last Presidential election was also full of criminal actions by the ruling party, the election period 145 politicians were killed and 543 received injuries. There was large scale vote buying and distribution of goods and money to bribe the voters.
Indo-US relations strained
President Trump’s unconventional foreign policy decisions, some of which affect friend and foe alike have caused friction in Indo-US relations forcing India to explore other options.
For example, its decision to withdraw from the six-party international nuclear accord with Iran and its decision to punish those countries that deal with Iran would affect Indo-Iranian trade, especially in the energy sector. Similarly US sanctions against Russia affects India’s defense interests.
During her recent visit to New Delhi US envoy to the United Nations Nikki Haley is reported to have asked India to “revise its relationship with Iran”, a proposal New Delhi has not taken a liking to.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi seems to look for other alternatives. Despite US pressure to absorb India into an anti-Chinese bloc with Japan, Australia and Israel, despite the five nation Naval drill in the Pacific; India joined the Shanghai Cooperation Council last week as a full member along with Pakistan.
Premier Mod speaking at the Shangri-La Dialogue last month, invoked the phrase “strategic autonomy”, hinting that there is a rethinking in his foreign policy. Since January, he has personally reached out to the Chinese and Russian Presidents in informal summits, and invited the Iranian President to Delhi.
As the Hindu editorially noted “Mr. Modi has had little contact with Mr. Trump since their meeting in Manila last November, which by all accounts did not go well. Now, the postponement of the Indian Foreign and Defence Ministers’ “2+2” dialogue with their U.S. counterparts has denied the governments a chance to gather together the fraying bilateral threads.”
In Indian foreign policy what is paramount is the national interest and not personal glory or partisan politics.
