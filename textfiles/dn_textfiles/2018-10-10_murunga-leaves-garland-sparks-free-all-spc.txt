Murunga leaves garland sparks free for all in SPC

In what could be termed as a shameful piece of conduct in the presence of schoolchildren and the public, Southern Provincial Councillors threw punches, hurled abuse and threats at each other as complete chaos erupted in the council assembly yesterday morning.
Members of the Southern Provincial Councillors who gathered for the monthly meeting held yesterday went berserk in this manner in the presence of schoolchildren and members of the public who were in the gallery.
The school children and members of the public made a hurried exit unable to bear the chaotic and rowdy behaviour of their elected representatives.
As the Council members were arriving for the scheduled monthly meeting, UPFA Councillor and Joint Opposition loyalist Channa Saliya Mendis entered the Chamber with a bundle of Murunga leaves which provoked a group of United National Party members as a result of which a brawl between them erupted. Finally, councillor Mendis was prevented from entering the Chamber with the Murunga leaves.
However, as the Chairman Somawansa Kodagoda commenced the proceedings of the meeting, Leader of the House Chamly Withanachchi alleged that the UNP councillors assaulted the UPFA member at the entrance to the Chamber and demanded an investigation into the alleged incident.
Later, a frenzied argument over the issue continued among the councillors of both sides. Consequently, some United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) members who were Joint Opposition loyalists came to the Well of the Chamber and shouted and behaved offensively in protest against the alleged assault. Subsequently the UNP councillors who could not endure the disruptive conduct of the UPFA group also rushed into the Well resulting in a free for all. The fisticuffs continued for some time disrupting the proceedings of the House. UNP Councillor Chandana Priyantha is a raised voice rejecting the allegations of assault challenged the other side to come out of the Chamber if they wanted a real fight.
At this stage the school children and members of the public who condemned the disorderly conduct of their elected representatives left the Council Chamber expressing their disgust .
The Chairman failing to control the House suspended proceedings for 15 minutes.
