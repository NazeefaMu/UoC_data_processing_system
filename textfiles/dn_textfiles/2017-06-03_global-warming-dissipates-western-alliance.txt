Global warming dissipates Western alliance

Disagreement over the Paris Climate Accord of 2015 has dissipated the alliance of Western powers. This week President Trump announced the decision of the United States to withdraw from the Paris Accord which pledged to reduce the global emission of Green House Gases (GHGs) to 20 C above the pre-industrial levels. The Accord has also set a limit 1.50C as its target to be achieved by 2020. One hundred and ninety seven countries signed the Accord and of them 147 have ratified it so far. Only Syria and Venezuela did not sign the Accord.
Reduction of global warming is a matter of life and death for the human species. If it becomes impossible to reduce global warming below 1.50 C, Greenland ice cap would melt, and so would the Himalayan ice. This would raise ocean levels and island nations would face the danger of being submerged in the ocean.

An Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) working Group Assessment Report (WGAR5) outlined the following consequences of global warming:
* Risk of death, injury, ill-health, or disrupted livelihoods in low-lying coastal zones and small island developing states and other small islands, due to storm surges, coastal flooding, and sea level rise.
* Risk of severe ill-health and disrupted livelihoods for large urban populations due to inland flooding in some regions.
* Systemic risks due to extreme weather events leading to breakdown of infrastructure networks and critical services such as electricity, water supply, and health and emergency services.
* Risk of mortality and morbidity during periods of extreme heat, particularly for vulnerable urban populations and those working outdoors in urban or rural areas.
* Risk of food insecurity and the breakdown of food systems linked to warming, drought, flooding, and precipitation variability and extremes, particularly for poorer populations in urban and rural settings.
* Risk of loss of rural livelihoods and income due to insufficient access to drinking and irrigation water and reduced agricultural productivity, particularly for farmers and pastoralists with minimal capital in semi-arid regions.
* Risk of loss of marine and coastal ecosystems, biodiversity, and the ecosystem goods, functions, and services they provide for coastal livelihoods, especially for fishing communities in the tropics and the Arctic.
* Risk of loss of terrestrial and inland water ecosystems, biodiversity, and the ecosystem goods, functions, and services they provide for livelihoods.
Nepal's Parliament Speaker Onsari Gharti Magar
China (20.09 percent), the United States (17.89 percent), and the European Union (13.24 percent) are the regions with the highest levels of GHG emission. Russia emits 7.13 percent and all other countries 33 percent. Hence the withdrawal of the United States from the Accord will affect the Accord considerably and would make the realization of its objective more challenging.
President Trump’s decision is in keeping with his America First agenda. It is no secret that the Republican Party has been receiving generous funds from the coal, oil and gas industries that were clamouring against the climate accord. For example the Federal Election Commission has found after investigations that the party received US $ 9 million from those industries during the election campaign. Recently 22 Republican Senators requested President Trump to withdraw from the Accord. It was reported in the media that these Senators received US $ 10 m as campaign funds from the US coal industry.
Though the withdrawal could benefit the workers in the US energy field temporarily, it would in the long run affect them too as renewable energy becomes cheaper and predominant in the future. That is why forward looking companies in the US energy sector too are against President Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris Accord.
The European Union and China have criticized the American decision to withdraw from the Accord. They are also opposed to the proposal of President Trump to renegotiate the Accord to suit US concerns. Leaders of Germany, France and Italy have openly criticized the US decision while Canada, the United Kingdom and the United Nations have expressed dismay at it. Smaller European nations such as Denmark too have joined the critics. At the time this edition went to the Press a joint communique on defending the Accord was to be announced in Brussels at the EU-China Summit held from June 1-2.
By withdrawing from the Accord the United States would also lose its leading role in the Western alliance and globally too. In contrast, China has been faithful to its pledge in reducing GHG emissions and has even fulfilled its obligations. Both China and the EU are ready to accept a greater burden in view of the additional challenges to the Accord arising from the US withdrawal. At present China is the world leader in renewable energy generation and the EU has the lead technology in the sphere. Hence EU-China cooperation would be a significant positive factor in the realization of the objectives of the Accord, even without the US.
President Trump’s America First policy is leading to its isolation in the world arena, especially its relations with Europe. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has openly declared that Europe would have to take its fate into its own hands as it could not depend on the United States any more.
Women power in Nepal
It was Vladimir Illych Lenin, the founder of Soviet Russia who said that the emancipation of women is an index of the degree of democracy existing in a country. In this sense, despite the arrogant claims of politicians Sri Lanka seems to be even behind Nepal, our distant Himalayan neighbour.
Even though both patriarchy and caste discrimination are more pronounced than here in Sri Lanka, the newly reborn Nepal following a violent revolution that took place in the early years of the first decade of the new Century has again made significant advances in women’s participation in elections and democratic governance. In Parliament both the Speaker and the President are women. The Chief Justice of Nepal is also a woman.
The new Constitution approved in 2016 after 8 years of deliberations has mandatory provisions for women representation. Though considered modest by external standards the current local government elections are proving that it has given a fresh boost to women power that even Sri Lanka with over 80 years of Universal suffrage could be put to shame.
According to the results of the first part of the election that was held on May 14th already 4 Mayors, 65 Vice-Mayors, 8 Village Council Chairpersons, 263 Vice-Chairpersons have been elected. Some more results are expected. According to non-confirmed reports four more women are likely to be elected as Vice-Mayors.
