The House  Collection 2017  showcase

Barefoot clothes are different. They are unique. Barefoot has been working this way for 52 years. This year they want to show you how they do, what they do and why their clothes are so diverse.
Barefoot hand weave both coarse and fine warp and weft textures and their handloom fabrics are characterized by the vivid use of colour. Most of their handloom fabric is made from 100 percent cotton. They also weave a small amount of silk and cotton. Barefoot design is inspired by the land and seascapes, marine life, flora and fauna of Sri Lanka and they translate these into abstract geometry to produce beautiful and useful hand woven cloth.
Their collection of contemporary clothing comprises of on-loom finished, draped and stitched garments constructed from simple geometric sections of cloth.
In creating their clothes for men, women and children, Barefoot has attempted to revive traditional methods of design and construction using materials sparingly and maximizing the sewing skills we value highly.
