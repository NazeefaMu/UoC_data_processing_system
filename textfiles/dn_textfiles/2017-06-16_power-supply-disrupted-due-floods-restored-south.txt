Power supply disrupted due to floods, restored in South

Restoration of power supplies to families affected by the recent floods in the Southern Province has completed at the moment.
According to CEB Southern Regional Deputy General Manager S. S. Kahanda, electricity connections of 111,530 families in the Galle district, 158,924 families in the Matara district and 49,600 in the Hambantota district were disconnected by flood waters.
Accordingly, the total number of affected families in the Southern region is 320,054. Electricity is restored to all families. Kahanda expressed gratitude to all those who worked hard despite difficulties and obstacles such as earth slips, road blocks, damage to power sub stations and lack of access to roads in the endeavour to restore power supply.
