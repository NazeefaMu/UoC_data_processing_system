Dinesh Jayawardana keeps Mobil flag flying high at Cavalry Super Cross

The Cavalry Super Cross 2016, which flagged off on the 12th of June 2016, was the setting for a remarkable return to gravel racing for veteran racer Dinesh Jayawardana.
After a two year hiatus, Jayawardana qualified 2nd on grid behind Ushan Perera and ahead of Aravinda Premadasa and Pasindu Peiris, who qualified 3rd and 4th respectively. Jayawardana, with his many years of experience, was not in any way ready to give away his position despite the immense pressure in both races.
He held his nerve and drove brilliantly to hold off Pasindu Peiris in Race 2 and comfortably finished in 2nd place.
Ushan Perera won both SL-GT races and took home the Best Driver award for the day, whilst Kaushalya Samarasinga managed to secure 3rdplace in both races.
Jayawardana also managed to secure 2nd place in his pet event from back in the day (SL-H up to 1600cc) whilst his wife Shehara Jayawardana finished 4th in the same event.
With three podium finishes overall for Jayawardana, this weekend proved to be a very positive one for the Mobil Racing Team.
