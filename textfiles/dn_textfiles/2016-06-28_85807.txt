Warawita bowls President’s  to victory

 
 A fine bowling spell of 5 for 17 by Vimukthi Warawita helped President’s College, Kotte to defeat De La Salle College, Mutwal by 33 runs in their inter-school under 15 division one tournament cricket match played at Kotte.
Homesters batting first were all out for 143 runs with S G Wijesuriya claiming 5 for 45 and in reply at one stage visitors were sitting pretty with 89 for 2 and with the introduction of Warawita they collapsed for 110 runs.
In their second essay President’s were 203 with Thashika Nirmal scoring 59 runs and K G R Sandeepa captured 5 for 44.
