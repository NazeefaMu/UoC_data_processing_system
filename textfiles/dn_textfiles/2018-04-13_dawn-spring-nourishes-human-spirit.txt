NEW YEAR MESSAGES
The dawn of Spring nourishes human spirit

The dawn of spring brings the flourish of nature and nourishes the human spirit as we meditate on the ideas of cooperation, forgiveness and empathy for all life, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in his New Year message.
“Sinhala and Tamil New Year is the foremost national festivity celebrated across the country in the splendour of spring. It provides the ideal setting to deepen relationships with each other and share our rich cultural heritage”.
“This New Year we will celebrate with our traditional customs to convey their importance to the next generation. This will ensure future generations are proud of our traditions and our nation”.
“I wish all Sri Lankans a joyful Sinhala and Tamil New Year that inspires our commitment in achieving sustained peace and prosperity”, the Prime Minister said.
