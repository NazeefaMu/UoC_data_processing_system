Light of Asia

SARC represents the Greater India in the dreams of Nehru and other fighters for liberation of India from British imperialism. We unitedly represent, may be one forth of humanity. Humans are the same, irrespective of colours and bodily differences. So much so scientist say we are all children of one mother separated from Homo erectus. Yet humans like to be in groups with much commonality. Anybody coming to Indian sub condition will see that Indians are very much the same; surprisingly common things are so much, one can forget where you are in this vast land. However once you are in slowly will see the differences.
Person arriving from Delhi to Colombo and on the road from Colombo to Kandy may thank the gods for having allowed this break from the bitter cold of Delhi into such a lush paradise of warmth and water and throat-searing food. But we have to be careful because many say it is also a bit disorienting to be in this country. It feels like Indian, the landscape is especially so and yet there is something that is distinctly different.
Remarkable literacy rates
One does not get this kind of disorientation in a patently different land — Japan or Sweden for example; there everything is new, different and modern so one is clearly an outsider. And within greater India, even in places far away from one’s usual place of residence there are reminders of the larger country one claims citizenship of the SARC — Hindi film music wafting out of narrow lanes, life-sized posters of unpleasant politicians wishing someone or being wished by someone.
So how are Lankans different from other Greater Indians? of course there are all the textbook stuff on Lanka that was rammed down throats in classes on development in college — the remarkable literacy rates (virtually universal), the excellent health (infant mortality, maternal mortality and life expectancy levels that rival Western Europe’s), the fantastic public services for health and education that persist in the face of a neo-liberal economy.
Also everybody knows that this country has seen more than two decades of brutal violence, which appears to have finally ended or at least paused due to a period of even more brutal violence. But these are not things that one notes visually and emotionally disturbed enough to account for one’s feeling of disorientation. Then what are these more obviously visible unique features of life in Lanka? One media person answers ‘I think that three startling differences make up the root cause of my disorientation. May be they are related, but may be they are not — they are quite distinct and don’t automatically accompany economic growth.’
First of all (and dearest to any democrat) is the ease and joy with which women traverse public spaces. In the densest crowds, such as in the packed public buses they ride in Colombo and in the heaving masses pay their new year’s respects at the Sacred Temple of Tooth in Kandy. Apparently if this had been India (and especially if this had been Delhi), there would have been few women daring enough to actually be present as well as to smile pleasantly at strangers.
Indian cities
In Lanka women smile at even male strangers, as male media people happily discover. Instead in India they would be fearful of being groped and mauled if young (or even middle-aged) and pushed roughly aside if old and weak.
The second reason for feeling out of place in Lanka, we are told, is that public spaces are unreasonably clean. Neither in Colombo nor on the road to Kandy did they see the mounds of filth-encrusted plastic bags and other forms of smelly or environment-contaminating waste that even the most expensive parts of Indian cities and towns revel in. Nor were public buildings and roadsides ungrudging receptacles for fiery red spit. We know this is an achievement in the last few decades due to the progress of modernism.
The third striking absence, according to them, was of the kind of degrading poverty one sees in such abundance in any place in India. One media person said “I don’t think their poor and homeless get hidden from view as ours reportedly were in Delhi during the Commonwealth Games and, yet, even the one apparent beggar I saw on the street, and tried to give some change to, turned out to have a sheaf of lottery tickets she pressed upon me in return.” So Yahapalanaya is not so bad. However we must understand the situation is not as rosy as they paint. English speaking Yahapalanists in Colombo who travel by A/C cars and shop in malls can be enjoying the sunshine.
Women are landless in the north due to militarization. Nearly 90,000 have been made widows and struggle to make ends meet. Loan sharks have taken the life of several women. The perpetual search for their loved ones snatched by the military amidst government denial is the harshest burden upon them. Justice seems to be a distant dream for their missing men.
Gender-based violence
Women in Lanka also face many critical forms of discrimination, including gender-based violence and the ill-treatment of migrant women and their children. Apart from domestic violence, women are also subject to sexual abuse, putting them at risk of unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS.
Lankan women’s already poor rates of labour force; participation continue to decline despite steady economic growth. Apparently young and poorer women in Lanka are particularly vulnerable, experiencing significantly higher rates of unemployment. How are the conditions in other parts of Greater India? Is not the problem we Indians face criticism from all world famous feminist leaders.
