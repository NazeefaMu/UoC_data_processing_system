Peace Air goes to Human Rights Commission

Peace Air one of the three short listed bidders to take over and run SriLankan Airlines has made a complaint to the Human Rights Commission saying that they have not been called to provide Due Diligence for their bid.
Gamini Wethasinghe, Managing Director Peace Air said that the Government had informed that they would not be invited to exercise Due Diligence for the airline with Lufthansa Consulting.
“We have also forwarded a SWIFT of US $ 5.5 billion from Deutsche Bank in this regard. We think that our rights have being violated and hence have made complaint with the HRC.”
He told media yesterday that in addition they would also file a case in the Supreme Court on this same issue. Wethasinghe said that their bid is for US $ 5.5 billion and in addition have made another bid to run the Mattala Airport with a pledge of US $ 2,2 billion. “The government is yet to come back on our Mattala offer too.”
Asked by Daily News Bussness what they would do now he said they will bring in four A380 aircraft and run Peace Air from Colombo as a new airline.
