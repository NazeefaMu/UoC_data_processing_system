DS Buddhist Society donates houses to the underprivileged

The Eheliyagoda Divisional Secretariat (DS) Buddhist Society extended a helping hand towards underprivileged citizens by donating houses through a united scheme, Ratnapura District Secretary Malinie Lokupothagama said.
She was addressing villagers, DS Officials, and the other participants at a house-handing-over ceremony to Asoka Dilhani who is a mother of two children residing in the Kiriporuwa Grama Niladhari division, nearly seven kilometres off Eheliyagoda. The new house was built at a cost of nearly Rs. 1 million with the Buddhist Society funds and the contributions from donors in the area. Wiring and the electricity was supplied for the new house by the Eheliyagoda Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) branch staff', free-of-charge.
DS Lokupothagama praised the house donation project of the Buddhist Society and added that it is a good example of the social work performed by government servants.
The society has so far built and presented three houses to underprivileged families and another two houses are currently under construction.
