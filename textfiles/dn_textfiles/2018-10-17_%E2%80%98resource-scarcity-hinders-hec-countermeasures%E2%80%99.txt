‘Resource scarcity hinders HEC countermeasures’

Housing and Constructions Minister Sajith Premadasa said that the lack of human resources, as well as vehicles, had hindered human-elephant conflict (HEC) countermeasures.
He was addressing a Hambantota and Suriyawewa Regional Development Committee meeting held on Monday at the Hambantota Administration Complex.
He said that setting up more electric fences was not enough to combat the issue and added that they should be regularly maintained as well. Residents should help Wildlife and Civil Security officials in the endeavour, the minster said.
Minister Premadasa said that elephants often broke electric fences and wandered along highways and railway tracks.
Agriculture Minister Mahinhda Amaraweera, who also participated in the meeting, said that state officials should unite to make the agriculture industry more efficient.
He said that corn and green gram cultivators would be given incentives and added that ground nuts would not be imported any further.
