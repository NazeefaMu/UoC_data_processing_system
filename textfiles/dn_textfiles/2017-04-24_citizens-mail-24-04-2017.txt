Garbage galore
At the Anderson Flats, each of the 40 blocks is provided with 2 chutes on either side for garbage disposal, and there are openings at every floor to dump the garbage. Occupants had to walk up to the closest chute and throw the garbage into the chute at any time during the day or night. The CMC collected the garbage once a week from the entrance to the chute on the ground floor.
Recently the CMC advised occupants to separate the garbage: kitchen waste separately and all other items such as paper, plastic etc separately. If the convenience of the occupants was considered, all that had to be done was to assign one of the chutes on either side for kitchen waste and the other for all other items.
Instead the CMC sealed the openings of the chutes at all floors, and called upon occupants to place their kitchen waste in bins on the ground floor, and to hand over all other items to the collection van which calls over on Wednesdays. Upper floor occupants, some of whom are elderly persons or couples living alone, have been put into great inconvenience as they now have to come down with the garbage and climb the stairs to get back. To make matters worse, in one block, kitchen waste can be deposited only during a specified time of one hour.
Any arrangement to separate the garbage, should not inconvenience occupants and they should not be deprived of the facilities they have enjoyed up to now. Apparently, in areas where the garbage is collected by a private company, there are no complaints.
This may be an issue in other areas served by the CMC as well and it is up to the Condominium Authority to come up with a suitable arrangement which can be followed uniformly in all similar housing schemes.
The CMC may not be sensitive to such concerns, but candidates at the Local Government elections are in for a rude shock, if this problem is not resolved satisfactorily. The chutes have been used since the inception of the scheme. Why should they be sealed now?

Apt comments about Anura Kumara Dissanayake
This is to thank you for the very appropriate comments made on the editorial of April 18 regarding Parliamentarian Anura Kumara Dissanayake. You have referred to what he has stated regarding the change of government. He makes such impartial statements irrespective of party politics. In today's context the need of the hour is the presence of such leaders for the current society.
Even regarding Meethotamulla tragedy too, the JVP by its leadership has very clearly mentioned not to take political advantage out of such situations considering the period it commenced.
