Migrant workers’ minimum salary to be increased

The minimum salary for migrant workers would be increased, effective from February 1, Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorala said.
Accordingly, the minimum salary for skilled employees who would go abroad after getting themselves registered with the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) would be US$ 450.
The minimum salary for unskilled workers would be US$ 350, as proposed in the 2017 Budget.
New migrant workers are requested to register with the SLBFE.
