President, PM should work together - Speaker

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday said he earnestly wishes for unity between President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
He made this comment when approached by the media after an event to mark the 150th Birth Anniversary of late Sir D.B.Jayatilaka at the Public Trustee Department where a newly erected statue of Sir D.B.Jayatilaka was unveiled by the Speaker.
The Speaker, who was overloaded with questions from media personnel over the current political situation, however brushed aside any agreement on his part so far to accept the Prime Minister position.
“I earnestly wish that the two leaders will continue to work together. I have no involvement in any of the ongoing political discussions as I hold the post of Speaker. Let them discuss and arrive at an agreement,” he told a swarm of journalists waiting for him outside the event premises.
The Speaker had previously stressed that his party’s full endorsement is a must for him to accept any portfolio in the Government.
