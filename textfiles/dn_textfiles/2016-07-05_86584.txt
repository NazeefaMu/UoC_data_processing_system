Federer in 14th Wimbledon last-eight

London, Monday: Roger Federer reached his 14th Wimbledon quarter-final and tied Martina Navratilova’s all-time Grand Slam record of 306 match wins on Monday.
The seven-time champion achieved his double landmark by seeing off Steve Johnson of the United States 6-2, 6-3, 7-5 in the fourth round on Centre Court.
Federer, the third seed, next takes on Croatia’s Marin Cilic for a place in the semi-finals.
Cilic, the ninth seeded Croatian, progressed to his third Wimbledon quarter-final when Japanese fifth seed Kei Nishikori pulled out of their last-16 clash with a rib injury in the second set.
Federer has a 6-1 record over Cilic but the big Croatian stunned the 17-time major champion in the US Open semi-finals in 2014 on his way to his maiden Grand Slam title.
Venus, the oldest in last-eight for 22 years
Venus Williams became the oldest Wimbledon women’s quarter-finalist for 22 years as the five-time champion defeated Spanish 12th seed Carla Suarez Navarro 7-6 (7/3), 6-4 on Monday.
Aged 36, Williams is the oldest to make the last eight since 37-year-old Martina Navratilova’s run to the final in 1994.
Williams will be making her 12th appearance in the last eight at Wimbledon, and her first since 2010, when she faces Kazakhstan’s Yaroslava Shvedova for a place in the semi-finals.
Venus, seeded eighth, was broken twice in the first three games of the first set, but recovered from 3-0 and 5-3 down to win it in a tie-break.
The American legend, who won the last of her seven Grand Slam titles at Wimbledon in 2008, needed just one break to win the second set.
Williams, an eight-time Wimbledon finalist, will be bidding for her first Grand Slam semi-final appearance since the 2010 US Open.
Vesnina sees off bridesmaid for last-eight place
Elena Vesnina beat her bridesmaid Ekatarina Makarova in a gruelling three-set match between the Russian doubles partners in the Wimbledon fourth round on Monday.
Vesnina, the world number 50, beat 35-ranked Makarova, her long-term doubles partner, 5-7, 6-1, 9-7 in a two-hour, 47-minute contest. Makarova was a bridesmaid at Vesnina’s wedding last year. AFP
