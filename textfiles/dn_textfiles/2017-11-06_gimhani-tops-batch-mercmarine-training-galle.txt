Gimhani tops batch at Mercmarine Training in Galle

The 23rd batch of navigation officer cadets at Mercmarine Training recently passed out amidst much ceremony at the institute's training facility in Galle.
The glamorous event was graced by Chief Guest Sonia Lapointe, wife of the German Ambassador in Sri Lanka, the officials of the Mercmarine Group, parents and well-wishers.
The students were recognized with awards for their skills in various areas of study during the course; Cadet Gimhani Herath, was awarded the Dieter Dushner Challenge Shield for the 'Best All-Round Navigation Officer Cadet'.
"It is indeed a great pleasure to see another batch of navigation officer cadets passing out after successfully completing their first phase of training. It is even more gratifying to see a lady cadet to top the batch; a first for us. We firmly believe in the potential of Sri Lankan women to excel in careers at sea. Our heartiest wishes to Cadet Gimahani Herath on her achievement and the exemplary work," said Thomas Kriwat, Chief Executive Officer, Mercmarine Group welcoming the guests.
Addressing the gathering, Sonia Lapointe said, "I want to encourage bright, young people, especially women because so few have tried, to take this incredible opportunity and transform their future perspectives. It begins when you realize there is a place for you here; if you work hard, you belong here. I myself was in a male dominated environment some 35 years ago when I joined the Canadian Naval Reserves. I absolutely enjoyed training in a mixed crew and working on a ship; I learned so many things that I never would have learned in regular civilian life – particularly about myself”.
