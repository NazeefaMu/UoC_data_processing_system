Colombo National Hospital makes room for dengue patients

 
NHSL Director General Dr. Anil Jasinghe said yesterday that the Colombo National Hospital has increased its surge capacity and allocated a cubicle with eight beds from each ward exclusively for dengue patients.
He said that nurses with specialized training are appointed to manage each cubicle.
Dr. Jasinghe said that two beds from each cubicle function as High Dependency Unit with all facilities to monitor and manage serious dengue patients.
‘A total of 120 beds are allocated for cubicles from 15 wards. The nurses who manage these cubicles are especially trained for the task. Sixty High Dependency beds will be availed shortly in NHSL for dengue patients. Now 30 such beds are reserved’, the NHSL Director General said.
Currently 32 nurses and a group of doctors are trained at the IDH Hospital by Consultant Physician Dr. Ananda Wijewickrama, one of the leading dengue specialists in the country, he said.
The IDH Hospital Director was informed to divert dengue patients from its OPD to NHSL, he added.
Since June 15, dengue patients were diverted from the IDH Hospital to NHSL, Colombo North and Colombo South Teaching Hospitals, Thalangama, Piliyandala, Wethara, Aniyakanda and Dankotuwa<U+200B>Hospitals to ease the congestion in the IDH Hospital.
In addition to that, arrangements were also made to upgrade the High Dependency Units (HDUs) in Colombo North and Colombo South Teaching Hospitals, the NHSL Director General said.
