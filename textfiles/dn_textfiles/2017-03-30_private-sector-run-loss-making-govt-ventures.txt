Private sector to run loss making govt ventures

H’tota Harbour, Hyatt hotel, Colombo Hilton, SriLankan Airlines, Grand Oriental hotel among them:
The government has identified that globally acclaimed Private Public Partnership is the way forward for Sri Lanka as well and now the country will look for local and foreign investors to run and turnaround some of the loss making government entities (SOEs).
This was stated by Public Enterprise Development Minister Kabir Hashim at the Malaysian Business Council, breakfast meeting at the Hilton Residencies.
He said that PPP was successfully implemented in the USA and Malaysia initially. The US government sold over US$ 185 billion state assets in the early 1990’s.
Later even in countries like, South Korea and developing countries copied this. “In New Zealand seven government bodies including Telecom were privatised while in the UK 12 companies including transport, power generation and rail were vested with the private sector.”
In 2016, a record 216 government owned Chinese companies came into PPP deals with both local and foreign investors.
He said similarly in Sri Lanka too the government had identified some institutions like the Hambantota Harbour, Hyatt hotel, Colombo Hilton SriLankan Airlines, Grand Oriental hotel for PPPs. “We like the private sector to get involved in turning them profitable.”
“However in some countries PPP ran in to issues and in Sri Lanka too we are engaging the unions and public to explain the concept.”
Hashim said the government pumped in a staggering Rs.123 billion towards up keep of 245 SOEs in 2014 and this is increasing each year. The loss from these entities was Rs. 60 billion from which 300 hospitals with 200 beds could have been built.
The SriLankan Airlines’ privatisation to Emirates was a huge success and it brought in revenue to the country and as soon as it was unwisely taken over by the then government the airline made huge losses. “We messed up here.”
Minister however said that there are profit making SOE like Sri Lanka Insurance, state banks and eight other entities. “The total revenue generation form these 10 SOE’s was double the market capitalization of the Colombo Stock Exchange.”
The Minister said the government has now decided to firstly form a Public Enterprise Board to monitor the SOEs and then coordinate with investors to convert them to PPP. “Though it would be hard we want to discontinue the political appointment and appoint professionals to run some of the SOE’s”

The Transpacific Group (TPG) which was short listed to operate debt ridden SriLankan Airlines may not be given that opportunity.

Development Minister Kabir Hashim speaking at the Malaysian Business Council, breakfast meeting at Hilton Residencies last morning he said that one main reason to overlook TPG was that they don’t have airline experience to run a national carrier.
“In addition TPG is also a Fund management company and SriLankan was given to them to operate it may also damage the airline’s image.”
Asked by Daily News Business if the Request for Proposals (RFP) was on again to find a new player he answered in the positive.”We have got several new offers from global airlines and are perusing them.The door for RFP is not shut yet.”
He said that 14 companies responded to the RFP and three companies were short listed including TPG.
