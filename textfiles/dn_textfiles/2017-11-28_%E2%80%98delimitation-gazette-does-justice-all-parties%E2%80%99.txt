‘Delimitation Gazette does justice to all parties’

Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha yesterday said the Local Government Delimitation Gazette was flawless and that he tried his best to do justice for all political parties, including the minor parties, with the delimitation process. He stressed that he would at no point sell his integrity as a lawyer and a President’s Counsel for the sake of politics.
Speaking at the Committee Stage debate of Budget 2018 in Parliament yesterday, the minister took pains to convince the House that he was not to be blamed for the delay in Local Government elections, while flatly refuting the allegations of his involvement in the petition before the Court of Appeal.
Clarifying on his visit to Malta, the Minister said he went to attend the ‘Commonwealth Local Government Forum’.
“We presented an application to host that Forum in Sri Lanka in 2019. I presented a Cabinet paper in that regard and mentioned about my visit in it. As a Cabinet Minister representing the SLFP, I went to Malta with the approval of the President and the Cabinet. I did neither flee the country nor go for any personal reason,” Minister Musthapha said. The Minister was replying to allegations that he left the country without informing the House or the Prime Minister.
Denying his connection with the petitioners, Musthapha said he values his legal profession more than being an MP.
“I have been in the legal profession for the last 20 years. I have carried out my duties as an MP, lawyer and a President’s Counsel. There was a case filed against me and an Interim Order was given. There were allegations that I was party to this case. Some people dubbed it as a ‘Musthapha vs Musthapha’ case as the lawyers helped in that case worked in my father’s Chamber at a particular time. Lawyers appear for various purposes,” he added.
“I worked with good intentions. It is not my fault that the LG polls could not be held due to a court order.
I am not ready to hamper democracy. But somebody has to suffer for the past sins. Some people, who are looking for ‘billy boys’, are trying to use me for that purpose.
Despite that, I always do justice to the country, Parliament and my Party,” Minister Musthapha clarified.
Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Dissanayake intervening at this point queried as to whether the Minister was not aware of the flaws in the February 17 Gazette for nine months till November 17.
MP Dissanayake stood his ground that it was a “Musthapha vs Musthapha case” for the reason that the petitioners are close associates of the SLFP ministers.
The Minister insisting that the Gazette was flawless said, “I hope my name will be cleared when the court announces its verdict in the case. The Attorney General, who appeared for me, told the court that there is no fault in the Gazette,” he said.
“Two No Confidence Motions have been filed against me. I am not afraid to go before a people’s court to prove my case as my intentions were clean.
Any citizen can go before the court and file a petition. There can be different interpretations on the motives behind a case. We cannot waste time finding such motives. Neither the President nor the SLFP has any involvement with that case. We have a democratic process. If an Interim Order has been obtained you cannot blame the Legislature or the Executive.
We should respect the court and obey its order,” he noted.
