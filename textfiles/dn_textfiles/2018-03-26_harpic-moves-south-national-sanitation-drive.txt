Harpic moves South with national sanitation drive

Reinforcing its commitment to bring clean sanitation facilities to all, Harpic together with the Ministry of City Planning and Water supply completed the first set of 100 toilets the two parties have committed to build each year.
The Shri Wijeya Early Child Development Centre, Ransegoda South, Kamburupitiya was among over 30 beneficiaries in the Matara district to receive a new sanitation facility in the first phase of the project, committed to by Harpic and the Ministry of City Planning & Water supply in 2017. The Shri Wijeya Early Child Development Centre, Ransegoda South, Kamburupitiya was established over 40 year ago, but has never had a proper toilet facility until now. An estimated 50 children under the age of 6 years old, receive their first introduction to formal schooling at such institutions across Sri Lanka.
In March 2017, Harpic launched the ‘Harpic Suwa Jana Meheyuma; Mission Wellbeing’, in collaboration with the Ministry to elevate the status of hygiene across households in Sri Lanka. The project sought to build 100 toilets annually in selected districts and begun in the Katana area in the Western province.
State Minister of City Planning and Water Supply, Sudarshani Fernandopulle who has been a key proponent in the project since its inception said, “We had a very positive response to the project in 2017, and hope that we can continue this initiative to drive good sanitation and hygiene.”
Matara District Public Health Inspector, P. Mohotty, addressing the gathering stated that “there are many areas across the island where families suffer without proper sanitation facilities.
The Ministry of City Planning and Water Supply has identified the need for nearly 180,000 toilets across Sri Lanka.
