ComBank partners SLT Campus and Cisco

Students in grades eight to ten in selected schools can now benefit from a comprehensive 150-hour IT hardware course funded by the Commercial Bank of Ceylon and implemented in collaboration with SLT Campus (Pvt) Ltd.and Cisco Networking Academy.
This course was launched as part of the Bank’s Online Education programme conducted as a Corporate Social Responsibility initiative.

A globally accepted ‘Cisco IT Essentials’ certificate will be presented to the students who successfully complete this course.
While the Commercial Bank of Ceylon bears the costs of accredited IT instructors to conduct the courses, Cisco provides the course content, holds exams, and manages the issuance of certificates free of charge and SLT Campus delivers IT courses.

Commercial Bank has also previously partnered with Cisco Networking Academy to offer an ‘IT Essentials’ course for teachers and students free of charge. It also supported the ‘IT Essentials-Instructor’ certificate course for teachers at the Cisco Networking Centre at the University of Moratuwa under this programme.
The Bank has donated 175 IT Labs to schools under its flagship IT education initiative and is a partner in the government – private sector ‘Smart Schools’ project, currently encompassing 65 schools in the Western Province. Commercial Bank has also made substantial investments to develop the curriculum for all age groups for this programme and has developed an online learning portal called Sipnena to benefit students.
