Cabinet Paper to increase crop insurance

The Agriculture Ministry has presented a Cabinet Paper to increase crop insurance from Rs 10,000 to Rs 40,000 per hectare with the support of National Insurance Trust Fund (NITF), Agricultural Ministry Secretary B Wijeratne said.
Responding to a question by a journalist at a press conference at the Strategic Enterprise Management Agency (SEMA) yesterday, the Secretary said the potato, chili, Soya bean, maize and big onion cultivations would be covered from this insurance scheme in addition to paddy cultivation.
“In order to implement this plan, we need a contribution of Rs.1,350 from each farmer. The NITF agreed to provide Rs 675 of that amount. The Government has asked for a survey report to determine whether the farmers can afford to pay the balance of Rs.675.We have asked the Peradeniya University to furnish this report after an opinion survey of the farmers,” he said.
The Secretary said the Government hitherto obtained a contribution of Rs.150 from each farmer when facilitating the voucher for fertiliser subsidy and utilized that contribution to offer a crop insurance coverage upto Rs 10,000. The insurance scheme covered crop damages at a natural calamity.
