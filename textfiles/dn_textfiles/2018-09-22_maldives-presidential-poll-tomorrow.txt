Maldives Presidential poll tomorrow

THE MALDIVES: Maldives President Abdulla Yameen seeks a second term as President tomorrow in a tourist paradise that has become a battleground for influence and a source of global alarm over political oppression and a muzzling of the media.
The EU has said it is ready to slap travel bans and asset freezes on individuals “if the situation does not improve”, while the US has warned it would “consider appropriate measures” against people undermining democracy and rule of law.
Battered by years of violent intimidation, spurious arrests and enforced exile, the opposition has united behind a joint candidate -- the little-known Ibrahim Mohamed Solih. But voters would be hard-pressed to notice, with heavy-handed decrees and reporting restrictions stifling a media already fearful of doing anything to offend the President of the Muslim nation of 340,000 people.
The government has used “vaguely worded laws to silence dissent and to intimidate and imprison critics”, some of whom have been assaulted and even murdered, according to Human Rights Watch.
A few foreign journalists seeking to cover the election have been granted visas, and in many cases only at the last minute, anecdotal information suggests.- AFP
