Human Rights Prize awarded to a Sri Lankan

The Franco-German Prize for Human Rights and the Rule of Law was awarded for the second time since its inception to Shreen Abdul Saroor a human rights defender, who specializes on women’s rights and empowerment and engages in reconciliation work between Muslim and Tamil displaced communities.
She has made it into the rows of the 15 winners that have been selected by the two countries’ Foreign Ministries out of 36 applicants. Challenges faced by Shreen in her own experience of being forcibly evicted and displaced by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam (LTTE) in 1990, along with members of her community, laid the foundation for her activism.
The prize is granted to persons who show significant engagement in the protection and the promotion of human rights and the rule of law. It was awarded for the first time in 2016 in Berlin by the German and French Foreign Ministers Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Jean-Marc Ayrault to honour the work of 15 outstanding human rights activists from around the world, and will be taken forth on an annual basis.
