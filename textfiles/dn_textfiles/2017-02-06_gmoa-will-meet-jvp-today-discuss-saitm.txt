GMOA will meet with JVP today to discuss SAITM

 
The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) will hold a discussion with the JVP today (6) on the current situation on SAITM, GMOA Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoyza said.
At a meeting in Kalutara yesterday Dr. Zoysa said the GMOA had also met with representatives of the Joint Opposition on Saturday, to discuss the SAITM issue.
Several MPs representing the Joint Opposition including former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had also participated in the meeting, he said.
The GMOA will commence legal procedures after an expert study on the legal background of the issue, Dr. De Zoyza said.
The GMOA staged a four-hour token strike on Friday at government hospitals across the country over the arrest of university students protesting against SAITM.
The GMOA will educate all parties including the public on the existing situation and the threat posed on the safety of the lives of the patients, Dr. De Zoyza added.
