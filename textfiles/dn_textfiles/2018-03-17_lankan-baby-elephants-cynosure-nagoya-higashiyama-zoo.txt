Lankan baby elephants, cynosure at Nagoya Higashiyama Zoo

Four Kangaroo cubs were presented to the Dehiwela Zoo by the Higashiyama Zoo in Nagoya, Japan, yesterday.
<U+200B><U+200B>The Director of the Dehiwela National Zoological Gardens Dammika Malsinghe, said the Kangaroo cubs are kept at the Ridiyagama safari park for safety.
A black Rhinoceros cub was born at the Dehiwela Zoo in 2013 and named 'Mihiri.' The parents of the cubs were presented under an animal exchange programme from Japan, in 2007, for which, Sri Lanka presented Japan two elephants. The pair of rhino cubs was therefore called Anula and Kosala.
The <U+200B><U+200B>Director of the Higashiyama Zoo Masami Kurome, said the female elephant delivered a baby elephant on 2014. The baby elephant had been the first Asian elephant to be born at the Higashiyama Zoo and the third Asian elephant to be born in Japan.
Anula and Kosala were brought to the Higashiyama Zoo in 2007 from the Dehiwela Zoo. The birth and growth of the new baby elephant at the beginning of the New Year was symbolic of the growth of the longstanding friendship between Sri Lanka and Japan, he added.
He further said that according to Zoo authorities, the most popular attraction at the Zoo were the Sri Lankan elephants.
The Assistant Director of the Ridiyagama Safari Park Hemantha Samarasekara said that they provide quarantine facilities, regular care and regular veterinary care for the Kangaroo cubs.”<U+200B><U+200B>
