Electricity consumption rises as drought hits several areas

The country’s electricity consumption has increased by 10 percent due to drought in several areas, Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.
The minister said power consumption per-day has shot up to 44 gigawatt-hours from 40 gigawatt-hours, while water levels in some hydro-power generating reservoirs have dropped by 20 percent. The coal-fired power plant at Norochcholai, which generates 300 megawatt of electricity has been closed for repairs, he said.
“However,” he said, “we take every step not to increase electricity tariffs.”
“We will face the challenge by cutting off extra expenditure and resorting to a special management strategy,” he said.
