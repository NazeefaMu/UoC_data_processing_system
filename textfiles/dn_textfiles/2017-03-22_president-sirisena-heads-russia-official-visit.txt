President Sirisena heads to Russia on official visit

 
Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena left today on an official visit to Russia, the President's office said.
President Sirisena is the first Sri Lankan leader to visit Russia since 1974, when then Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike visited Moscow.
The visit takes place as both countries celebrate the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations this year, the Foreign Ministry said earlier.
During the visit, President Sirisena is scheduled to hold a bilateral meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday.
The official discussions are expected to review progress made in the longstanding bilateral relationship, including the way forward to further promote trade and investment between the two countries.
Several bilateral agreements in the areas of fisheries, tourism, cultural and education cooperation, including cooperation in the science and technology sector, are scheduled to be signed.
In order to actively promote trade and business linkages between the two countries, a Sri Lanka-Russia Business Forum will be held in Moscow, and Sri Lanka will be represented by a delegation of the Sri Lanka Russia Business Council.
Minister of Foreign Affairs Mangala Samaraweera and five other cabinet ministers are accompanying the president on the trip.
