G20: Trump hails talks as ‘success’ despite divisions

US President Donald Trump has declared the G20 summit in Germany a "wonderful success", despite his country's isolated position on climate change.
In a joint statement, the leaders of 18 nations and the EU recognised the US decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement.
However, they also said other G20 members remained committed to the "irreversible" accord.
Deadlock over the issue had held up the last day of talks in Hamburg.
A final agreement was eventually reached and the joint summit statement was officially released on Saturday.
The statement also said the US would seek "to work closely with other countries to help them access and use fossil fuels more cleanly and efficiently".
The Paris accord sets targets for greenhouse gas emissions aimed at curbing global temperature increases.
In her closing news conference, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who hosted the summit in Hamburg, said she still deplored Trump's position but that she was "gratified" the other 19 nations opposed its renegotiation. (BBC)
