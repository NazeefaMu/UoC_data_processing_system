Three more modern hospitals in the offing: Minister

Three more large hospitals will be built in Sri Lanka assisted by Russia, and the United Kingdom. One hospital will be built at Panadura at a cost of Rs. 21,000 million, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Another will be constructed at Kirimandala Mawatha, Narahenpita and the other in the Colombo city limit.
The Minister was addressing the gathering during his recent visit to the Kotelawala Defence University, Ratmalana.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that 45,000 nurses are required and 14,000 will be recruited soon.
"A nursing faculty will be established at Sri Jayewardenepura and Sri Lankan health officers will be trained in Singapore.
More medical faculties should be established in Sri Lanka," he said.
"Foreign medical students do not go to Bangladesh, Nepal and other countries but they come here since we provide better facilities," he said.
"Former President J. R. Jayewardene introduced the open economy amidst objections. Today all are talking about the open economy, he said. "We should thank the former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa for establishing the institution by making a prompt decision.
Such persons should be in the country to introduce new policies," the Minister said.
Officials of the university and Health Ministry were preset.
