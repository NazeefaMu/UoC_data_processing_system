Ampara violence: Ministers call for swift action

Ministers Rauff Hakeem, Rishad Bathiudeen, Mano Ganesan, and Daya Gamage had raised their concerns over the incidents of communal violence in Ampara, in particular with regard to police inaction during the attack.
The ministers raised the matter before President Maithripala Sirisena in Cabinet on Wednesday, adding that the attack seemed to be well-coordinated possibly by opposing political forces. They called on the President to intervene, adding that such incidents could destabilize the present government administration.
Minister Hakeem spoke up over police inaction and added that intelligence units should have been able to pick on the attack and prevent it from spreading to other areas. This had prompted the President to promise to Cabinet that he would take up the matter with the Inspector General of Police. Meanwhile, Minister Bathiudeen called on the government to provide adequate compensation for the damage to vehicles and property.
