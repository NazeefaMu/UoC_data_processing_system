Rajitha highlights Sri Lanka health achievements

World Health Assembly:
Sri Lanka has achieved progress in healthcare delivery due to cost-efficient use of resources and the coordinated use of well ingrained primary, secondary and tertiary health care facilities, Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Minister Senaratne was addressing the 70th World Health Assembly (WHA) meeting in Geneva recently.
The Minister who is leading the Sri Lanka delegation to the 70th World Health Assembly also updated the Assembly on the progressive action taken by the Government in combating Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), such as introducing 80 percent pictorial warning on tobacco, increase of tobacco tax to 90 percent, introduction of a ‘traffic light labelling system’ to control sugar in fizzy drinks.
On communicable diseases, he highlighted Sri Lanka’s achievement of gaining WHO certification of Malaria elimination. He, however noted epidemic challenges faced by the country on Dengue and H1N1 and called for increased partnership in addressing those challenges.
Minister Senaratne earlier addressed the Commonwealth Health Ministers’ Meeting outlining Sri Lanka’s successes in the health sector which were commended by the Health Ministers at the meeting.
Commonwealth Secretary General Patricia Scotland praised Sri Lanka on its higher quality outcome achieved at a minimum cost. This is a model that could be replicated across the Commonwealth. She made these remarks during a bilateral meeting with Minister Senaratne, and requested Sri Lanka to consider leading within the Commonwealth on digital –health.
