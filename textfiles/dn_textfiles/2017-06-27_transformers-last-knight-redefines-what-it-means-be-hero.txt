Transformers: The Last Knight redefines what it means to be a hero

‘Transformers: The Last Knight’ by Paramount Pictures in 3D, is an upcoming American science fiction action film based on the toy line of the same name created by Hasbro. It is the fifth installment of the live-action Transformers film series and a direct sequel to 2014’s Transformers: Age of Extinction.
The film was directed by Michael Bay, with Mark Wahlberg and Stanley Tucci reprising their roles from Age of Extinction alongside Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, and John Turturro from the first three movies. Bay has stated this film marks his final picture in the franchise.
Humans are at war with the Transformers, and Optimus Prime is gone. The key to saving the future lies buried in the secrets of the past and the hidden history of Transformers on Earth. Now, it’s up to the unlikely alliance of Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg), Bumblebee, an English lord (Anthony Hopkins) and an Oxford professor (Laura Haddock) to save the world.
There comes a moment in everyone’s life when we are called upon to make a difference. In ‘Transformers: The Last Knight’, the hunted will become heroes. Heroes will become villains. Only one world will survive: theirs, or ours.
“Transformers: The Last Knight” is screening at Majestic Cineplex at 10.15 am, 1.15 pm, 4.15 pm, 7.15 pm and Fri/Sat at 10.15 pm and Empire Cineplex at 1.30 pm, 4.30 pm, 7.30 pm and Fri/Sat at 10.30 pm and Sat/Sun at 10.30 am.
