Garden cultivation  in Thihagoda enhanced

 The projects initiated in the Thihagoda Divisional Secretariat Division a few months ago to cultivate home gardens have proved a success now.
Nearly 5,000 gardens have been cultivated covering all grama niladari divisions in the area to date. Medicinal herbs, fruits and vegetables can be seen in many gardens by now. Farmers have been provided with planting materials, and know-how by the divisional authorities to encourage them in home gardening.
