Navy arrests 21 Tamil Nadu fishermen: Indian Chief Minister writes to Modi

 
As twenty-one fishermen were arrested by the  Navy for allegedly entering into Sri Lankan waters, Indian Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palanisami wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi yesterday (2), seeking his intervention in getting them released.
Nine fishermen in a mechanised fishing boat who set sail from Nagapattinam fishing base of Nagapattinam District and 4 fishermen in a mechanised fishing boat who set sail from Rameswaram fishing base of Ramanathapuram District were apprehended by the Sri Lankan Navy, the CM said.
Noting that the state government is “extremely concerned” about the continuing apprehension and detention of our fishermen and their boats, he said the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL) is itself a matter that is subjudice in the Supreme Court of India.
“Forty-eight fishermen and hundred and twenty-two fishing boats are currently in Sri Lankan custody. Further, boats and fishing gear of these fishermen which are the only means of livelihood of the poor fishermen are still impounded in Sri Lanka,” Palanisami said in the letter. 
He asked Modi to take up this serious issue with the highest authorities of the Sri Lankan Government and ensure the immediate release of the precariously berthed boats.
