Suspect in raping Sri Lankan girl dies in Dubai jail

A court in Dubai has dropped a criminal case against an employee who kidnapped a woman while she waited for a taxi and raped her, following his death in confinement.
The Sri Lankan woman was waiting for a taxi at 7pm after she finished work in Al Quoz area when the two Pakistani suspects forced her into their car in September.
The two men then headed to a remote area in the outskirts of Dubai before each of them raped her twice and threatened to kill her.
Records said the woman was too frightened to resist the men who overpowered her physically and that she had been beaten when she tried to leave the car when they stopped at a gas station to buy water.
Shortly after the rape, the woman called up a colleague at work and informed her. The colleague later accompanied her to the police.
After obtaining an official letter confirming the death of the 31-year-old Pakistani defendant inside his confinement, the Dubai Court of First Instance dropped the criminal charges against him due to his death.
One of the men called up the woman on her mobile, threatened to kill her if she told anyone about the incident, said records.
Police tracked down the 31-year-old and apprehended him but his accomplice remains at large and police are searching for him.
The woman testified that the defendants stopped in front of her and offered her a ride but she refused.
“Suddenly one of them came down, forced me into the car, and drove away quickly. When the driver stopped at a station to buy water, I tried to run away … the other man turned towards me and beat me hard. They kept me locked in the car and raped me in an unpopulated area. I was too scared to cry for help because they were very huge in size. They dropped me back at Al Quoz area at 11pm. Later, I told my work supervisor and she took me to the police,” she testified to prosecutors.A police sergeant said they tracked down the mobile number of the 31-year-old and lured him through one of his friends before they apprehended him.
