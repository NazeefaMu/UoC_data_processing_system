We fill a big gap, says SAITM

The institute gives a chance to those who miss out on admission to state medical colleges as the universities have limited capacity in accommodating all qualified students.
“Several students who got 'three As' but failed to enter state universities were given full scholarships by SAITM who came with the recommendation of the UGC,” SAITM Chairman Dr. Neville Fernando said.
He claimed that only the Sri Lankan society looks down upon private university education. "Even if there were no private medical colleges in Sri Lanka, students who have the financial capacity will attend foreign universities to obtain the degree. Accusing the SLMC of maintaining double standards, SAITM Registrar Husni Hussain claimed that despite Sir John Kothalawala Defence University not having their own teaching hospital, the degree is accepted by the SLMC.
“Rajarata University do not have enough professors. Though there are clinical materials, there are no professors to teach them. These deficiencies are not visible to the eyes of SLMC,” he accused.
SAITM is willing to work with the SLMC to improve standards, he claimed.
“If there are deficiencies they should point it out in a right manner and guide us to improve it. The government has to take a firm decision with regard to the issue for the betterment of the students,” Hussain said.
