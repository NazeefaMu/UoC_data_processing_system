OGM Foods & Company (Pvt) Limited, one of the most popular companies in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) segment in rice flour industry won the Provincial Level Merit Award under the Small Category – Manufacturing sector, at the CNCI Achiever Awards 2018.
The Award Ceremony was organized by the Ceylon National Chamber of Industries (CNCI) and was held recently at Hotel Galadari for the 17th consecutive year. CNCI annually organizes this coveted Achiever Awards Competition to recognize and reward the industrialists in the manufacturing and service sectors.
Household consumption drives the majority of sales in the FMCG segment. Growth in this segment has increased considerably in emerging markets in recent years. Appreciating this trend in the market, Zubair who had served the nation as a public servant in the capacity of a Grade I School Principal started a new venture simultaneously with his busy schedules in 1992with the unstinted supporting hand of Zubair in the hope of creating a proud future for their family.
They started the business with all family members to make rice flour in their kitchen, which was gradually expanded with his retirement, developed into an industry of Roasted Rice Flour and Spices in the face of heavy demand for their products. There was no retirement life for Mr and Mrs Zubair and they had to sacrifice their whole comforts and spent tireless days and sleepless nights to let their children stand on their own feet.
The Product has now been branded as OGM - Roasted Rice Flour. After a lapse of a period of above 25 years, they now possess a fully-fledged and well organized business. Their Head Office, stores and Spice Division are situated in Mawanella, while their factory is situated in Kekirawa. They have generated much direct and indirect employment now.
Nyfer Zubair, the son of Zubair is heading the business now as the Chairman and the business is run by Riyas M Thoufeek as the General Manager. They have a growing market and the market share is getting widened. The secret behind the increasing demand for their products is mainly for three reasons, Nyfer said. One is the genuineness of their products, the second being their innovativeness based on the customer needs.
More importantly, the third is the dedication of their employees. Nyfer Zubair, with tearful eyes, thankfully acknowledged the great pains taken and the sweats shed by his parents along with the contribution made by his brother Imran to bring the company where it is today.
