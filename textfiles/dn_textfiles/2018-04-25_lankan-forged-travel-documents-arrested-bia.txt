Lankan with forged travel documents arrested at BIA

A Sri Lankan who tried to leave for Ireland with the falsified documents of a merchant sailor was arrested by the Department of Immigration and Emigration at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA)yesterday.
The suspect, a resident of Jaffna had arrived at the airport with the plan to initially fly to Singapore SriLankan Airlines flight UL 308.
Identified as Alfred Edison, he had approached Immigration and Emigration Officer S.A.M.S.R.Maulana and questioned him about getting to his flight.
The officer whose suspicions were aroused by this line of questioning had directed him to the Chief Immigration and Emigration Officer C.M. Munasinghe.
Munasinghe informed the media that when the suspect was further questioned, his answers were not satisfactory and thus they had proceeded to inspect his belongings. During their first search, they had found a medical certificate and various other documents but on conducting a second inspection, they were able to uncover other documents which had been cleverly hidden inside the bag.
A merchant sailor is allowed to enter in country by law and the officers were able to find false documents issued by the Sri Lankan government certifying him as a merchant sailor, a naval service record book containing details of his professional career, other false naval documents and a letter of employment from an Irish shipping company.
Upon further questioning, the suspect had revealed that he had falsified these documents to travel to England via Singapore so he could join his uncle in England. From there, they had planned to go to Belfast in Ireland for a naval job there.
The officers had also found some naval certificates on him and the suspect had denied receiving any naval training to get them.
The suspect was later handed over to the Airport Crimes Investigation Department for further investigations.
