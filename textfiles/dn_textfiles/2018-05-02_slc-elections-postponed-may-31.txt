Current administrators to continue as interim body
SLC elections postponed for May 31

The much awaited elections of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) will take place on May 31 following a legal issue that forced them to postpone it from being held as scheduled on May 19.
At a press conference held at SLC headquarters yesterday, SLC president Thilanga Sumathipala said that he will appoint a special election committee on May 19 at a special general meeting according to the directive given by the Minister of Sports Faizer Mustapha and then conduct the election on May 31.
In the meantime he said the Minister of Sports had approved the present administration of SLC to continue as an acting interim committee from April 27 to May 31 until the elections are held.
Speaking further Sumathipala the incumbent president stated that he was the most qualified and suitable candidate for the post of presidency.
“During my presidency I have proved by bringing SLC to a profitable status when they had suffered heavy financial losses when I took over,” said Sumathipala.
“There are 61 affiliated clubs who nominated my name out of 84. They have trust in me, and my team. Many have questioned my eligibility for the SLC presidency. Yes, I was a founder and owner of a newspaper but at present I am not involved in any activities in the media field. They also blamed me that I was engaged with a sport good business but it was my wife who was engaged in it. Because of this a few years ago when I came forward to contest my nomination was rejected.
The newspaper was formed in 1986 and I became a vice president of SLC in 1995. I was totally away from the business according to the SLC constitution,” he said.
“When I took over the SLC presidency we were in debt for nearly Rs. 5 million. I have now made SLC a profitable organization with almost Rs. 2 million in profits.
“We have done immense changes to SLC and our affiliated members are also well aware of it, that’s why so many clubs have shown their support by nominating me for the presidency once again. Our main concern is the forthcoming Cricket World Cup. We have to work out a plan and target. We have a clear vision in everything we do,” Sumathipala said.
