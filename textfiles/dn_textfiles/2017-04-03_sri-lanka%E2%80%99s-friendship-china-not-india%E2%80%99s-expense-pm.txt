Sri Lanka’s friendship with China not at India’s expense: PM

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe assured that Sri Lanka’s friendship with China is not at the expense of India.
Premier Wickremesinghe was responding to WION’s Senior Journalist Padma Rao Sundarji, participating in a television interview as a part of World Is One Global Leaders series.
“We have always been friendly with China, but not at the expense of India. We are friendly with many countries but not at the expense of others. Our relationship with India is different from that with China. What you have to look at is our relationship vis-a-vis India and not get too worried about how we are doing with China, or the UK, or anyone else.”
The Prime Minister also pointed out that the two governments are moving closely with each other and whatever that is seen as uneasiness between the two, probably would be the point of view of Indian media.
“We have our good defence relationships, we have our economic relationships. We are looking at a number of projects,” the Premier said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe also pointed out: “We are working with each other on an economic and technical cooperation agreement, one that will also lay the basis for a closer relationship between Sri Lanka and the economies of the five south Indian states which should be at least worth 500 billion US dollars.”Speaking on a strong security relationship between the two countries, the PM said: “There is close sharing of information. There are a lot of informal contacts between Indian ministers and our ministers, Indian officials and ours. I think this has been one of the good periods of the relationship between India and Sri Lanka.”
The Prime Minister added that in the previous week, the Indian and Sri Lankan Naval authorities had a discussion over lands in Hambantota that could be invested in and leased out to any industrial estate operator.
He said there is a land near Galle in which Sri Lanka would like to work together with the Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation.
“Sri Lanka is like any other country. Industrial land is held by the government and any interested investor can lease it to run their industrial estates. We like it because that means bringing in investors to the country. Even India is discussing an industrial estate in Sri Lanka,” The Premier pointed out.
“We are looking at how India can participate in Sri Lanka’s effort to develop the Trincomalee harbour together with Japan,” Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
“We are both committed to seeing the success of the Bay of Bengal as an economic area. There’s a lot of potential there in the next 10 years,” he said.
