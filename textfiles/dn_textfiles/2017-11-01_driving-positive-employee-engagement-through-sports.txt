Driving positive employee  engagement through sports

Employee engagement is a vital element in creating a successful corporate culture. Virtusa, the largest IT services exporter in Sri Lanka with a workforce of nearly 3,000 IT professionals, has managed to create a strong culture of camaraderie through sports and games.

Be it through a game of table tennis or pool at the office or outdoor sports activities, the company has found a way to create highly engaged and happy employees. The recently held Canekeratne Trophy cricket tournament brought everyone in the organization together. Here’s a deeper delve into their unique execution.
On equal footing
“Sports is a great equalizer,” says Chandi Dharmaratne, senior director, Human Resources at Virtusa. “It puts everyone on the same playing field regardless of designation.”
She explains that there are limits to which day-to-day teamwork can engage people and bring them together as a closely-knit team. Hence the need for a change of setting to one with a more casual atmosphere.
“We have always thought out of the box when it comes to employee engagement. As a tech company, we went beyond just a cricket tournament and included an additional social aspect utilizing our internal social network Yammer that really engaged our employees.”
Chandi explained how an internal voting system was set up on Yammer to choose the ‘Most Popular Team’ and how each team could campaign for votes. This led to campaigning on a global scale, across the company’s geographies and offices with employees from all levels interacting with each other resulting in a record level of Yammer usage in Virtusa’s history.
“Everyone was engaged and invested in the outcome of the vote,” she adds.
This inclusion of a social aspect to the sports event garnered greater interest from everyone as well as expanded it from a single day event to one that kept them engaged for weeks. It also opened lines of communications across departments as well as between employees and the management. It even eliminated the need for any athletic prowess and made it simply about enthusiasm and communication – everyone was truly on equal footing.
Nusky Lafeer, consultant – Technology Services, is a member of the team voted the ‘Most Popular’ at the conclusion of the Yammer campaign. “When the likes count started to go above 1,500+, the competition got very serious,” said a very amused Nusky.
“The team went through the entire global headcount report and started talking to individuals to be a part of the Yammer campaign. Virtusans from other geos like USA and Germany wished us luck for the tournament and they were really happy to be a part of choosing the most popular team," Nusky added.
“Everyone in the team was so excited to the point that some showed up for work even on weekends to keep our lead steady,” he reminisced.
Associate consultant Akila Galappaththi’s team lost in the semi-finals but she recalls that they had so much fun that the outcome did not matter to them. “We were excited from the beginning. Apart from regular practice, we spent a lot of time creating the perfect logo and name for our team too,” noted a very joyful Akila.
“We were beginners when we started the tournament but the excitement of the whole event and everything leading up to it made us feel like professionals. We were very happy about each other’s performance and it was great team work and so much fun,” Akila added.
Creating an internal culture that employees know and communicate with each other can have major benefits to a company. Virtusa has long been a company with an eye on the future and delivering long term results is part of its DNA.
Engaging offline
After weeks of creating anticipation and excitement, the day of the tournament was one of camaraderie and fun attended by players and non-players alike. The online engagement had successfully translated offline, as everyone was already excited about their favourite team winning the actual tournament long before the first ball was bowled.
The Runners Up position was secured by the team which represented Virtusa’s Facilities staff. Gihan Sameera Fernando captained the team. “As the Facilities Team, we extend our services to the whole of Virtusa. Therefore, we received immense support and encouragement from everyone across the company. It was exciting to see how they cheered for us all the way from Yammer to the field,” he said.

“Our main goal was to make the Facilities Team proud. This achievement is a result of the dedication and commitment of each member of the team,” added a visibly proud Gihan, who also won the ‘Best Batsman’ award.
The tournament saw many exciting moments but none more so than the champion’s trophy being awarded to the winning team that ultimately made the crowd erupt in cheers. In the end, regardless of who won, each person at the field that day revelled in the victory.
“Winning the Canekeratne Trophy was a proud and unforgettable moment for us,” said an ecstatic senior consultant Pramod Chamalka Sendanayake who captained the winning team. Leading the team to beat 41 others was not an easy task recalled an exhausted Pramod, reminiscing the long road to victory. He attributes the win to his team’s dedication, hard work and team spirit. “We were in good form as everyone was dedicated and took part in regular practice sessions. Our winning attitude and determination got us here,” he said.
He went on to add that special occasions like these are a wonderful opportunity for team building, interacting closely with colleagues and taking a break from the regular work environment.
