Section of Southern Expressway closed due to falling of electricity cable

A section of the Southern Expressway between Kadawatha and Kaduwela was closed last night due to the falling of a high-tension electricity cable.
As a result, the Kadawatha exit of the highway was also temporarily closed and motorists were advised to take the Kaduwela exit. Meanwhile, seven areas in the Western and Southern provinces including Horana, Mathugama, Ambalangoda and Galle experienced a power outage due to a breakdown in the Biyagama - Pannipitiya transmission line.
