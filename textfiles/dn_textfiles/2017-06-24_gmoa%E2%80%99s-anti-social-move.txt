GMOA’s anti-social move

Dengue has reached epidemic proportions, with over 63,000 persons infected this year alone. Over 200 dengue-related deaths have been reported so far. The dengue challenge has been complicated by the emergence of a new strain for which much of the population has no immunity. This is truly a crisis for which immediate solutions have to be found.
One tends to think that the Government doctors would be in the vanguard of efforts against the dengue crisis, treating patients, educating the public and engaging in research on treatment and prevention. Alas, in this country the doctors are far too busy striking work apparently in support of anti-SAITM university students who broke into the health Ministry premises and vandalized buildings and vehicles the previous day. All patients, including dengue patients have been left to their own devices, the only silver lining being that all other health workers from attendants to nurses are working 24/7 to address the crisis.
The doctors’ action led by the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA), which is increasingly looking like a political party with a hidden agenda rather than a pure trade union, is wrong on several counts. First, the country is facing a serious health problem vis-à-vis dengue. Doctors perform an essential service and have to be on duty in hospitals at least during their roster times. Second, the students were wrong to forcibly enter the Health Ministry. University students, or anyone else for that matter, cannot take the law into their hands. The doctors must acknowledge this fact. By taking the side of the students, the doctors have shown their contempt for the laws of the land.
Third, all doctors take the famous Hippocratic Oath whereby they pledge to be in service of patients at all times. Named after Hippocrates, the father of medicine in modern Western culture, the oath binds doctors to various ethical standards and commitments. By shirking their responsibilities in this hour of need, the Government doctors have indeed violated this sacrosanct oath. Fourth, there are no reports to the effect that doctors are not doing channeling or private practice in view of their participation in the doctors’ strike. This means that only the poor patients get no access to the doctors, whereas the rich can consult them in private hospitals. This is indeed a serious breach of public trust on the part of the doctors.
There are also disturbing reports that the STF personnel who were injured during the melee at the Health Ministry had to be transferred to the Police Hospital as they had not received proper treatment at the National Hospital, Colombo. We cannot comment on whether this was intentional or whether the STF personnel were among the victims of the overall strike, but either way, it leaves a bitter taste in the mouth. The Armed Forces, Police and the STF sacrificed life and limb to give us a better tomorrow and this is certainly not the way to treat these heroes.
The average men and women interviewed by TV stations were highly critical of the doctors, who had benefitted from free education funded by the public through taxes. The general consensus that emerged through these viewpoints was that “enough is enough”. It is time to take stern action against the striking doctors and Health Minister Rajitha Senarathne has indeed promised “tough and unprecedented” action. Police too have launched an investigation under the direct supervision of Colombo DIG regarding the forcible entry made into the Health Ministry premises on Wednesday.
The Government should perhaps also consider a ban on channeling in the evening for Government doctors who strike work in the morning. If a private university is not good enough, the same logic should apply to private hospitals too. If the present laws are not adequate, new laws should be formulated to prevent strikes by Government doctors at least in an emergency situation.
The question arises as to who is going to pay for the damage caused to the buildings and vehicles at the Health Ministry. Minister Senarathne says the renovation of the damaged property would be undertaken by the Health Ministry through its annual budget. Again, these are funds paid for by the public and should have instead been utilised for the benefit of poor patients. The culprits who led the attack should be identified and punished. We do not know whether it is possible with present laws, but damages should rightly be claimed from the vandals themselves.
It is crystal clear that there is an unseen political hand (or hands) behind the attack on the Health Ministry and the doctors’ strike, even though only the Peratugamis have been blamed at this point. There are sinister political forces, which had previously been rejected by the public, at work to destabilise the National Unity Government. They will leave no stone unturned to return to their usual style of Governance rife with corruption, nepotism and authoritarianism. It is disheartening to note that even unions such as the GMOA have fallen into this trap. The GMOA must rethink its strategy or face the danger of losing the public trust completely.
