UNP will easily defeat Rajapaksas - Navin

Defeating the Rajapaksas is an easy game for the United National Party since they do not have a Presidential Candidate so far, Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake said on Sunday.
He pointed out that Mahinda Rajapaksa cannot contest for a third time. He added that Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and Basil Rajapaksa too have a chequered past.
Dissanayake made these observations during a meeting at Mawanella at which Highways and Road Development Minister Kabir Hashim and UNP members in the area were present.
He added that they hope to set up a UNP government of their own in the future. “To do so, the party members and politicians and supporters at grass roots leavel should work with an understanding and determination.
He added that there is good understanding among the UNP youth and we have to work to a proper plan. Our party wants to remain in power until 2025.
He added that it was not difficult to defeat the Rajapaksas. “What Mahinda Rajapaksa said in India was that Namal Rajapaksa has not reached the age limit to contest and therefore one of the Rajapaksa brothers would have to contest. It means that they (Joint Opposition) have no leaders other than the Rajapaksas.”
Minister Dissanayake added that this was not the case with the UNP as it has a number of young leaders. He added the best one would come forward.
“But, we should all stand unitedly. The UNP divided due to the R. Premadasa, Gamini Dissanayake and Lalith Athulathmudali conflict,” Minister Dissanayake said.
He further said that thousands of jobs would be generated along with the Gamperaliya programmes.
