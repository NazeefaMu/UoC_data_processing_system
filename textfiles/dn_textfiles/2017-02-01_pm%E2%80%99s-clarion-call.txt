PM’s clarion call

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has once again emphasized on the need for the continuation of the UNP-SLFP unity government, if the economy is to move forward. Speaking at a public function in Bandaragama, the Premier said it is essential for the UNP and SLFP to stay together so that there will be a powerful government to see the economy through.
A united front, no doubt, can overcome any obstacles, and what is more, is a sign of stability so important to inspire investor confidence. It is political acrimony down the years that has stifled development and undermined progress. It has been Sri Lanka's experience that the Opposition had always opposed ambitious government's programmes merely for the sake of opposing. Had J.R Jayewardene not had the steamroller majority he commanded it is doubtful if development programmes such as the Mahaweli would have got off the ground. Now, with the Unity Government enjoying a two thirds majority in parliament it is hoped that development projects in the pipeline would be pursued with unhindered. It is because both the UNP and SLFP collectively stood its ground that the Hambantota port project was flagged off despite opposition. Hence, the Premier's emphasis for a continuation of the present arrangement between the two parties.
In the past there were a few occasions where the two major parties could have coalesced for the well being of the country. But these opportunities were squandered due to partisan politics. One recalls Opposition Leader J.R. Jayewardene during the 1970-77 unity government extending his support to the Sirimavo Bandaranaike administration. But the Left leaders in that alliance, due to their prejudice against JR, would have none of it. More recently, there was the ideal opportunity presented by the Tsunami catastrophe for both parties to unite during a national tragedy. But, like before, those who should have known better let slip this golden opportunity too for selfish political reasons. Even the three decades long terrorist war failed to bring the parties together due to the failure of political party leaders to act as statesmen. As a result the country had to suffer dire consequences by way of retarded growth and economic decline.
Hence, the Premier's view that both parties should join forces to lift the country from its present morass should be heeded by all. It is time for all political leaders, at least now, to act with maturity and foresight setting aside all selfish motives and parochial considerations. Hitherto, it was the practise that with every change of government the incoming regime dispensed with all the development programmes undertaken by its predecessor. The vicious cycle continued, with the end result that the country was bogged down without moving ahead. The contentious and divisive nature of the politics, practiced, was the sole reason for this.
The status quo is bound to continue far into the future if at some point this retrograde politics is not called to a halt. The country can no longer afford the luxury of divisive party politics, with the economy burdened as it is by a mountainous debt. There should be a collective effort to resurrect the country from the depths it had fallen into socially, culturally and economically. The country's future cannot be surrendered at the altar of vituperative, contentious party politics. This is the long and short of the Premier's appeal, which is more or less a clarion call for unity.
The SLFP need not have any misgivings in working with the UNP. It has today many things in common with the Greens. The differences between the parties on economic policy no longer exist. The SLFP has already shed its inward looking, indigenous economic concepts and embraced the UNP's market economy. Former President Chandrika Kumaratunga of course should be credited for this transformation in the SLFP thinking. Both parties are also on the same wavelength even on the ethnic issue, another laurel that should go to CBK.
Investors, hitherto, had misgivings, coming to Sri Lanka, due to policy changes with the change of governments. Investors fear that their ventures would be nationalised with the arrival of socialist governments. Many had this bitter experience during the 70-77 period which saw the flight of foreign investments from the country. On the other hand, an inclusive government would not create such doubts in the minds of investors.
President Sirisena, like the Premier, does not lose an opportunity to emphasize the need for the continuation of the present arrangement for the benefit of all. Although the UNP is in the driving seat, by virtue of its majority in parliament, the SLFP need not feel inferior or have misgivings in cooperating with the Grand Old Party. In fact some vociferous SLFPers in government have shown their independence by expressing their views openly at what they see as infringements by their senior coalition partner. However they should desist in creating fissures in the alliance that would be exploited by the MR faction of the SLFP, giving it an opportunity to undermine the cohabitation arrangement.
