SL Customs to host  awareness session for paperless procedures

In an effort to fast-track trade, Sri Lanka Customs is now ready to adopt paperless trade procedures. It is necessary to swiftly adapt from traditional procedures to the ASYCUDA (Automated System for Customs Data) World System and to ensure an efficient transition.
Sri Lanka Customs in collaboration with the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce will host a special awareness session on “Implementation of Paperless Procedures” this Thursday. The aim of the seminar is to help users to adapt to the new system.
Further, the seminar will discuss its functionality, method of online real-time payments of custom duties, how to obtain a digital signature, how to initiate a real-time SL Customs payment at a bank, and the facilities available at LankaClear.
Following the session, a panel discussion comprising of experts from LankaClear and Sri Lanka Customs will take place, which makes this event the best opportunity to learn, clarify and master the new system, in readiness for its implementation.
The awareness session will take place at 9.00 a.m. on February 15, at the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce.
