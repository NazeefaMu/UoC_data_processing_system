Equal nationality rights, an utmost need

People are mostly concerned about the degeneration of the society; the spread of heinous crimes and continuous corrupt practices. Attacks on little children, in particular small girls have created uncontrollable anger. Hide and seek method of investigation in relation to bribery and corruption, has made the leaders of mass organizations loyal to the democratic revolution, impatient. For example they ask, is Avant Guarde an operation illegal, illicit and corrupt or not? Who gave permission for this private military institute? At least did they pay for the resources of Lankan people that they used? In the middle of these campaigns of people for democracy, pro fascistic movement is once again preparing to raise the battle on the Geneva based discussions, connected to the problem of war crimes in Lanka. Democratic leaders believe that there is an umbrella issue covering all, namely the problem of finding a solution to the Tamil national problem.
War crimes investigation
Some people believe that global powers including India are using the threat of war crimes investigations to promote a political solution to the national problem. It is an imperialist conspiracy but meant to serve the best interests of both Lanka and India!
Global powers were enthusiastic for an international war crimes investigation. However, now together with the Lankan Government, they favour purely domestic process. Clearly, the mass uprising in Lanka for democracy has opened the eyes of global powers. They had to admit, though they supported Mahinda regime there wasn't the slightest prospect of a political solution, whereas there is now at least a reasonable prospect for it. Still, one can argue that the threat of an international war crimes investigation was meant to propel the Lankan Government towards a political solution. That is to give much benevolence to global masters.
It is more likely that they have opted to accept the democratic revolution, in order to keep it within their folds. Their method of intervention now comes under the support given to arrive at a solution to the Tamil national problem! The Tamil leaders may be very happy but the history tells us that global capitalism intervenes to give less democracy to the oppressed. It is better to accept help with concern and suspicion.
People have to be twice concerned, because there has been a change in the Indian leadership in the recent times. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a much tougher Hinduthva character than Man Mohan Singh, a western educated rationalist gentleman.
Tamil organizations
During his visit to Lanka Prime Minister Modi outspokenly advocated federalism, to show his sympathy to Federal party leaders and their struggle. Furthermore, it is claimed, unlike the Congress leaders from the time of Nehru that respected Buddhism as the apex of Hindu religion, Modi as a devotee of the ideology of Hindutva, went out of the way to affirm the Hindu commonality of the Lankan Tamils and the Hindus of India. Of course it is natural, for people of same culture and ideology to come together and claim same identity.
Nobody could complain about Hindus in the Indian subcontinent getting together with a commonality; or about the common identity of Tamils in the sub continent. If such recognition of identity tends to upset other Lankans or Indians, then it is certainly a problem.
We must note that the TNA or any other Tamil leadership never insulted the Buddha or Buddhism and never hindered Buddhist in the sub continent getting together.
GTF the most prominent pro liberation Tamil organization in the diaspora has virtually become pro government. They have been admirably moderate in their statements in recent months; they are strongly supportive of the TNA.
Clearly, global powers do not want to challenge the Lankan democratic uprising as it is supported by the majority of Tamil organizations. Latter has been working with global powers and behaved within the limitations given by the west. Now it is not very difficult to believe that the US is acting with an understanding with India, in backing Lanka's proposal for a purely domestic process.
Does this mean that the liberal government of Maithri-Ranil is going to resolve the Tamil national problem in Lanka? Outside of the government, trade unions, civil organizations and social democratic political groups are campaigning for a solution and they press the government to go forward.
Need of the hour is the backing of the mass organizations for a solution based on the right of self-determination, autonomy and equality to all nationalities in Lanka. We expect that will lead to a unity with power sharing.
