KDU International Research Conference
Waidyaratne calls  for collaboration among disciplines

Innovative collaboration among various disciplines was imperative if the nation was to develop economically, socially and culturally, Defence Secretary Kapila Waidyaratne, PC, said yesterday.
The Defence Secretary was speaking at the inauguration of 11th International Research Conference of the Kotelawala Defence University.
“It is encouraging to note that each year the number of research papers submitted for the conference is on the increase. If we are to develop our nation, we have a professional responsibility to find opportunities for innovative collaboration,” he said.
Waidyaratne praised the role played by the KDU, adding that in addition to providing university education to the officers of the Army, Navy and Air Force, KDU has done a commendable job in educating deserving civilian students.
“In recent times, with nine academic faculties, the Southern campus and the recently established university hospital, KDU has been at the forefront of providing excellence through education, which it may not have dreamt of at its inception,” Waidyaratne said.
The Annual International Research Conference of KDU was held for the 11th consecutive year. Over 600 research papers were received out of which 350 were presented at this year’s conference.
The conference is organised under the theme ‘Securing Professional Excellence through Collaboration’.
