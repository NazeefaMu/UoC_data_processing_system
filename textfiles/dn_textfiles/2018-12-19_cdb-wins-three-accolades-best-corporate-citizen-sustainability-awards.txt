CDB wins three accolades at Best  Corporate Citizen Sustainability Awards

Citizens Development Business Finance PLC (CDB) stood tall among Sri Lanka’s leading industry and corporate entities who have each showcased immense prowess in contributing towards meeting national development goals, holding aloft three awards at this year’s Best Corporate Citizen Sustainability Awards.
Organised by the apex body of corporate organisations in the country, the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, CDB this year stood proudly as one of the country’s Ten Best Corporate Citizens, winner of the Best Corporate Citizen Sustainability Award in the Under Rs. 15bn Turnover category and gained a merit for the Best Sustainability Project for its ‘Act Early for Autism’ Awareness Campaign.
MD/CEO, Mahesh Nanayakkara commended his team for taking absolute ownership for CDB’s uncompromising focus on the triple bottom line. “Nearly each year, we have been fortunate to walk on that stage and hold an award or more as a corporate citizen that’s doing our very best for our stakeholders. This is only because our highly committed team believes in making a difference, making a change and growing prosperity from the bottom of the pyramid.”
Working on a strong sustainable business model, CDB works on a three pronged platform of uplifting the economic status of stakeholders, preserving the environment and uplifting the community.
Each sustainability strategy is committed towards social inclusivity, resource efficiency and zero carbon growth, empowering stakeholders both directly and indirectly.
CDB’s incisive environmental value creation spans a wide stakeholder segment with “Mihikathata Adaren” that teaches young people about conservation and preservation being one example. Social value creation continues to be expansive with knowledge at the fore of its “CDB Pariganaka Piyasa” initiative focusing on IT literacy, “CDB Sisudiri” on education continuity and volunteerism within its team in “CDB Hithawathkam”.
