Breitling in partnership with Colombo Jewellery Stores enters SL market

Swiss luxury watchmaker Breitling enters the Sri Lankan market in partnership with Colombo Jewellery Stores. The latest selection of Breitling models will be housed at the flagship store at Alfred House Gardens.
Breitling has played a crucial role in the development of the wrist chronograph and is a leader in this complication. One of the world's major watch brands to equip all its models with chronometer-certified movements, the ultimate token of precision, Breitling is also one of the rare companies to produce its own mechanical chronograph movements, entirely developed and manufactured in its own workshops.
A chronograph specialist since its founding in 1884, Breitling played a crucial role in the development of this instrument. In 1915, the brand foreshadowed the emergence of the wrist chronograph by inventing the first independence pushpiece at 2 o’clock. In 1923, it separated the “start/stop” functions from “zero resetting”, thereby making it possible to add successive times. In 1934, it set the final touch to the modern face of the chronograph by creating the second independent pushpiece. In 1969, it heralded a new era by presenting the first selfwinding chronograph movement. Today, Breitling is one of the rare watch companies to have its own mechanical chronograph movements, entirely developed and produced in its workshops.
Its onboard chronographs equipped World War II fighter planes and subsequently the commercial aircraft of the world’s major manufacturers and airline companies, earning the brand the status as “official supplier to the world aviation”. In 1952 it saw the birth of the famous Navitimer with its circular slide rule intended for airborne navigation. In 1962, this model became the first space-going wrist chronograph. In 1984 witnessed the launch of the Chronomat, the benchmark among aviation chronographs.
Breitling perpetuates these longstanding ties by associating with the biggest aeronautical events, by running several exceptional flight teams and by cooperating with the world’s elite pilots and aerobatics squadrons.
Trained in the tough school of aviation, a domain where safety is of vital importance, Breitling displays the same obsession with quality in all its “instruments for professionals”.
The brand submits all its movements to the tests of the Swiss Official Chronometer Testing Institute (COSC) – the highest token of precision and reliability. It also stands out in the realm and electronics by using exclusively Super Quartz movements that are ten times more accurate than standard quartz and by developing exclusive calibres including a connected chronograph. Be it sturdy cases, legible dials or robust bracelets, every detail of the watch exterior is designed to withstand intensive use under the most trying conditions.
