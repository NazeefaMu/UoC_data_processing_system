Debate on UN Resolution in Geneva: JO sabotaged debate fearing Govt. would place true facts before country
Justice and Buddha Sasana Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe alleged yesterday, that the representatives of a dictatorial regime that reverse the cause of democracy are still trying to sabotage the affairs of Parliament.
Addressing a media briefing held at the Parliamentary Complex yesterday, he said the Joint Opposition which strategically positioned a debate requested by the government to its own advantage, had no desire what so ever to participate in this debate.
If the debate happened, the government members would have placed the true facts before the people which the JO feared,” he added.
Today, the debate was about the UN resolution in Geneva and how it could affect the country. This debate was first requested by the UNP and only afterwards, the JO submitted it as their own motion. So, we also agreed to that. Due to the state funeral of Most Venerable Davuldena
Gnanissara Maha Nayaka Thera, the party leaders agreed to continue with the debate only till 3 pm. But the JO sabotaged the debate even though time had been allocated up to 3pm.The Standing Orders of Parliament, indicates how time is allocated to various political parties.
Political parties are given time without any problems. The Speaker has never denied time to any political party. We have allocated sufficient time to the UPFA.
It is an internal issue of the UPFA. If they really need to sort it out, they need to meet their party leader President Maithripala Sirisena and discuss it with him. We, the government nor the Speaker could sort out their internal party issues.
We have neither moral rights nor legal rights to involve in this issue,” the Minister said.
“It was none other than former President Rajapaksa who first initiated this human rights issue, not
the international community. A couple of days after the war, the then UN Secretary General Ban ki Moon arrived here. Along with him, the former President signed a document on May 23, 2009. In that document, Former President Rajapaksa stated that all accountability issues would be investigated and he would seek international support for the purpose of probing human rights violations, alleged to have taken place during the last phase of the war. It was on the basis of that document, the so-called Darusman Committee was appointed. So the blame for the origin of this issue should be placed on the Joint Opposition’s doorstep. They knew we would tell this to the House in the debate and disrupted the session.
“Had the previous government managed its foreign affairs better, the issue of human rights violations would not have come this far. Foreign affairs were in total shambles under the Rajapaksa regime, which appointed their family friends and relatives to the top posts of the
diplomatic and foreign service. It was not the Minister Prof Peiris who ran the ministry, but Sajin Vass Gunawardena. That government appointed Lankans holding foreign citizenships to the diplomatic posts. When a foreign national is appointed to a diplomatic post, that person’s top priority would not be the interests of this country, but his obligations to the country of his citizenship or the one which has issued him with a stay permit.
“We could have made use of the debate to expose the Joint Opposition who masquerades as true patriots. They knew their treachery would be exposed and disrupted the debate for their survival. What they did amounted to depriving the people of their rights and waste of public funds.
Parliament Affairs and Mass Media Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka also addressed the press.
To attend funeral of Ven. Mahanayaka thero: JO not opposed to cutting short sittings
The Joint Opposition does not object to the Parliamentary sittings time being cut short as a mark of respect to the most Venerable Maha Nayaka Thera of the Amarapura Chapter and enabling members take part in the funeral, said Joint Opposition member Dullas Alahapperuma.
He made this observation yesterday, joining the argument that flared up when JO member Dinesh Gunawardena said that the JO needed more time to speak on the resolution when the Speaker announced to move the adjournment motion.
MP Dullas Alahapperuma said the Joint Opposition agreed with the decision and even cancelled the special statement under Standing Order 23 (2).
"But our concern is that the Joint Opposition that moves this adjournment motion had got only one seventh of the debate time," said MP Alahapperuma.
"We have seen that when Opposition Leader R Sampanthan and Chief Opposition Whip Anura Dissanayake moved the adjournment motions, they were given a considerably time. We should be given more time."
Members of the Joint Opposition were never against closing the debate early yesterday as a mark of respect to the late Mahanayaka thera.
‘Sri Lanka at UNHRC: JO has nothing to speak on resolution’
The Joint Opposition has nothing to speak on the resolution on Sri Lanka at the UNHRC, said Chief Government Whip and Minister Gayantha Karunathilake in Parliament yesterday.
He made this observation yesterday, while joining the argument that flared up when JO member Dinesh Gunawardena said that the JO needed more time to speak on resolution when the Speaker announced to move the adjournment motion.
The Minister further said that if the JO had facts to speak about the resolution, they had to thank the government for providing the time to move the motion and commence the motion. However, Minister Karunathilake said that yesterday was a special day. "Today we hold the cremation of the Most Venerable Maha Nayaka Thera of the of the Amarapura Chapter which is to be held with State honours," Minister Karunathilake said. "We decided at the Party Leaders' meeting yesterday, to participate in it after adjourning sittings at 3 pm. So I think nobody in the House would object to it. However, Minister Karunathilake said yesterday was a special day.
‘JO has to solve their issues with President, not with Speaker’
The Joint Opposition members have to solve their issues with their leader President Maithripala Sirisena and not with the Speaker, said Leader of the House and Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella in Parliament yesterday.
He made this observation yesterday, joining the argument that commenced when JO member Dinesh Gunawardena said the JO needed more time to speak on the resolution when the Speaker announced to move the adjournment motion.
"As our Prime Minister always say, these problems concerning the Joint Opposition should be solved with the SLFP Leader President Maithripala Sirisena," said Minister Kiriella. "We will arrange a time for you to meet the President," he said. In response, Speaker Jayasuriya said that they would get it solved and solve the matter at hand.
JO as Opposition’s Goliath should be provided with more time:Dinesh
As the Joint Opposition is Goliath on the Opposition side, so it should be given a considerable period of the debate on the adjournment motion moved by the Joint Opposition on the resolution on Sri Lanka at the United Nations Human Rights Commission, said Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena in Parliament yesterday.
He made this demand yesterday, after having flared up during an argument before moving the adjournment motion.
MP Gunawardena said they had been given only 31 minutes to speak during the debate on the the resolution on Sri Lanka at the UNHCR at Geneva. He added that the usual norm in the House is that the group which is moving a motion be given 50 percent of the total allocated time. He added earlier that the JVP and the TNA received one hour when they moved the adjournment motion. He requested that his group too be given 100 minutes. "It is only the JO who speaks of the dangers faced by the country," Dinesh Gunawardena said. "That is not fair."
Adjournment of Parliament by Speaker: We were deprived of time to defend motherland, security forces: Dullas
Joint Opposition Leader and MP Dinesh Gunawardena said in Parliament yesterday, that the Joint Opposition (JO) strongly protested against the adjournment of Parliament by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya when there was an adjournment debate on the UN Resolution on Geneava to be taken up for debate at adjournment time.
He said the JO regrets that Parliament was adjourned in this manner and points out that this was a grave situation.
MP Gunawardena made this statement addressing journalists at the reporters room of the Parliamentary complex. The JO had requested a debate on this issue for the last month. The adjournment debate requested by the JO on the UN Resolution which is a betrayal of our valiant Security Forces was a agreed upon at the party leaders meeting. However, we came to know this morning that our four speakers had been allocated only 32 minutes. But it could have taken at least 15 minutes to read the adjournment motion and another 15 minutes to explain it. Then afterwards, there would have been no time left for anyone else to speak.
The Speaker was willing to consider giving more time for the speakers of the JO this morning. But the Leader of the House rejected this request during Parliament sessions. JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake had also wasted 15 minutes speaking on an entire different subject.
Later, the Speaker adjourned Parliament. Only we are speaking against this injustice done to Sri Lanka by the UNHRC. But, we were deprived of the time allocated to defend the motherland and heroic security forces.
MP Dullas Alahapperuma said it was very clear that the government was not ready for the debate, since there were only two Cabinet Ministers in the chamber since morning.
UPFA MPs sitting on both sides of the House: ‘Matter should be solved by discussion’
The issue concerning a section of the UPFA sitting on one side with the Opposition, while the rest are sitting with the government, should be finalised soon, observed Speaker Karu Jayasuriya in Parliament yesterday.
He said that he had nothing to do with the allocation of time for speaking in Parliament, while it was a matter between the government and the opposition.
The Speaker also observed that he was obsessed with the issues brought before him between these two factions. "This issue should be solved after the matter had been discussed with the party leaders, the UPFA, the President and the Prime Minister as well," the Speaker said.
