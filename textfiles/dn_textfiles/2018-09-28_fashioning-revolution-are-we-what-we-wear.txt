Fashioning a revolution: Are we what we wear?

There are many ways to see a country and Juliet Coombe talks to first class honours degree fashion student and lecturer, Prabod Dharshana Munasinghe, who is getting married this week after travelling around the UK researching what the environmental thinking is behind England’s fashion industry.
I am handed a Jack Daniels bottle on meeting Prabod's wife Danindi and on closer inspection I notice it is full of small rocks and it has been turned into an uber cool lamp shade recyling everything including the plug. Danindi may not make crochet bikinis to protect the ocean from further environmental pollution like her husband Prabod or use fruit to make leather, but she does in her own quiet way find clever ways to slow down the enormous landfill with her stunning re-use designs.
Prabod now a lecturer at the University of Moratuwa in Sri Lanka, is an extraordinary innovator in developing textiles, including an amazing colour range that uses natural herbs to help with skin conditions like dermatitis and boost skin health. Prabod travels from attending major events like Fashion Week in Central London and around the UK this year to unravel the threads we wear to see just how healthy, sustainable and ethical our clothes really are and the choices we make. The question we have to ask, of course, is do we care that jackets are being made using child labour in Bangladesh as price is so often the deciding factor or that kids sports’ accidents could so easily be avoided by not buying cheap rip offs or copies of ethical thought through brands?
This line of questioning and his outstanding research work on the subject has resulted in him joining forces with the University of Surrey, Guildford to research and set up an environmentally sustainable tracking system for fashion designers all over the world. This way, the whole story about garments and their history will be exposed and we can think before we buy our next coat or pair of socks, which might, like Paddington 2 did in the film, turning all our clothes pink, because the dye is not fixed or worse cause us to be ill.
Like learning about the history of a country and the rationale behind indigenous cultural customs, it is equally important not to buy anything we wear without understanding the wider environmental implications of our choices, and the much more serious issues if we choose to ignore them out of apathy or design for design’s sake. Prabod explains, “People talk about doctors killing people by accident and yet with fashion everything in the western world is lost in the aesthetics and price of the piece. This is serious as, if you do not consider how they are produced and controls are not put in place, cheap unsafe dyes can be used in your children’s clothing, which if they suck the loose ends, like all young kids do, could possibly poison them or cause long term health issues including asthma. In sports clothing, cheap copies have weak stitching or stretch if the material threads don’t come from Spandex, so, when kids fall over or have their garments pulled in contact sports they are exposed to dirty gravel and injuries that could so easily be avoided by using and buying the right material.”
Prabod counts himself lucky to research sustainable fashion initiatives in everything from the West End in London to the oldest market in London dating from 1170 when Henry II was on the throne, and one of the busiest shopping precincts in the UK, which has ranges from the super cheap like Primark to the uber expensive with some showing it matters by saying they are conserving water in their tags like GAP.
H&M prides itself in using organic chemical-free cotton, but they may use more water in production, so we should carefully balance our decision-making. Exploring everything from children’s clothing shops to a place where clothing pattern designs have been used to wallpaper the toilets of Woodys café, where we had our meeting, one can see the power of designers up cycling over discarding stuff, as it gives the place a vintage style that feels both unique and good for the conscience.
Prabod’s vision is to develop a responsible global fashion industry where we understand why a t-shirt is £2 in one shop and £100 in another and why we should buy skin-friendly material only that boosts our health with natural herbs rather than harms it with dyes that leak onto our bodies for example with jeans, which often cause skin diseases.
Also, he feels strongly that clothes should be used to boost children’s confidence. Consider the power of these performance influencers in sportswear for kids and the feel-good factor if kids know their clothes are not contributing to slave labour or pure water being wasted when designers could make other decisions by being held accountable for their choices when creating an outfit.
So many different things need to be researched such as the impact of not wearing correct bras, which cause back pain in many women over 40 in Asian countries and the strong suspicion that some fabrics have contributed to the rise in breast cancer? So many questions need to be asked and properly researched instead of just blandly blaming air pollution.
Looking closer as a traveller at the souvenirs we buy, like the local t-shirt for tourists, is key, as so often, to increase profits, they are sourced using low standard products in badly paid countries, infamous for unethical production methods. Cheap products usually have very sad stories behind them – often they have been made using cruel child labour; women working into the night in terrible conditions; or unethical practices in the workplace such as using poisonous dyes, which cause skin issues. These are not issues any of us can or should ignore.
Although not scientifically proven and needing proper research, diseases such as skin cancer could be caused by chemicals containing heavy metals or Blue 6, which can come off onto the skin. Prabod, as a result of these issues, has set up Knowhowexpert.com – an open forum with a group of experts. He was impressed by shops like White Stuff that design each garment in the chain to fit with the culture of the local area and consider both where the product comes from and the customer served, leading to a very different kind of shopping experience. Each shop has a space for kids to play in while their parents look round, and an area for you to think and ask questions with free tea and coffee so you can consider what you are buying and talk to the staff about how products are made. All of which helps us value a piece more e.g. knowing about the weavers in Sri Lanka, who have incredible historic skills passed down through the generations, which allow them to create beautiful shawls or handmade lace decorations that get added to a top or a pair of trousers - flourishes that turn the ordinary into the extraordinary. Like the highly successful Lush brand that shows the maker on every bottle, Prabod wants this to happen to every piece of clothing so we can see how it was created, the environmental cost of production, design decisions that take this into account, and us asking the questions before we buy, so that products can be traced from start to finish and we can all be responsible models of our fashion attire.
It will be interesting to discover what their wedding clothes are made from and what they will turn them into after the event. Whatever it is, I am sure being trend setters there will be many followers of their ground breaking work.
