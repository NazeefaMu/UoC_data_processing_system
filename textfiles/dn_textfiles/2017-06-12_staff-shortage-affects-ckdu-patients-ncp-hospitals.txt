Staff shortage affects CKDu patients at NCP hospitals

 The unwarranted delay in stationing adequate trained nursing staff and doctors to hospitals in North Central Province(NCP) has badly affected CKDu patients seeking dialysis treatment.
According’s to the provincial health care reports,20 dialysis machines available at the Hingurakgoda, Medirigiriya, Kebithigollewa and Medawachchiya Government Hospitals are lying idle due to the dearth of trained staff.
Although there are 28 dialysis machines available at the Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital,it is impossible to operate at full capacity due to the lack of specialised staff.
According to Provincial Hospital sources, there are around 15,000 Kidney patients in the province and this number is increasing rapidly.
