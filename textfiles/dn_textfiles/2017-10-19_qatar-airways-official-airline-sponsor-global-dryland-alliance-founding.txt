Qatar Airways official airline sponsor of Global Dryland Alliance Founding Conference

Qatar Airways was the Official Airline Sponsor of the founding conference of the Global Dryland Alliance (GDA), held in Doha, Qatar on October 15. The conference, which took place at the Sheraton Grand Doha Resort and Convention Hotel, drew delegates representing more than 25 nations, including ministers of agriculture and environment, as well as representatives of many international organisations.
An initiative of the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the Global Dryland Alliance (GDA) is an international organisation established to address issues related to food security and the environmental and economic impacts associated with climate change.
These aims are aligned with Qatar's National Vision 2030, which holds environmental preservation as central to sustainable and responsible future growth.
The conference highlighted the importance of international cooperation as the best way to develop new solutions and improve policies in the field of food security. Through cooperation with countries and organisations committed to ensure food security, the GDA will work to fill the gaps between research and food security policies to help dryland countries suffering from water scarcity, as well as enhance access to reliable resources of food, water, energy, seeds and fertilisers.
Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive, Akbar Al Baker, said: "We are proud to be the Official Airline Sponsor of this important conference, and to support Qatar's National Vision 2030. We have demonstrated a significant commitment to environmentally sustainable growth and environmental leadership throughout our global airline and airport operations, catering services, retail outlets and hotels. Our carbon reduction, staff education, recycling and re-use initiatives all contribute to an integrated sustainability strategy. Through our partnership with GDA, we hope to help develop global solutions to these shared problems."
Qatar Airways Cargo has played a key role in enhancing food security for the State of Qatar by airlifting stock and components for food production initiatives from various parts of the world.
As an international organisation, the GDA works with local, regional, and international partners to enhance food security in dryland countries and identify and implement solutions for agricultural, water, and energy challenges these countries face. The founding conference held in Doha showcased the spirit of cooperation and practical collaboration between the parties in attendance.
Qatar Airway's sponsorship of the GDA founding conference provided key support to this global environmental summit and to delivering the initiatives it champions worldwide.
