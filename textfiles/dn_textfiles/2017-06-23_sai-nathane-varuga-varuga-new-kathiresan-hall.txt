Sai Nathane Varuga Varuga at New Kathiresan Hall

For the first time the life of Shirdi Sai Baba will be presented in a dance drama in Tamil. This dance drama titled "Sai Nathane Varuga Varuga" will be staged at New Kathiresan Hall, Colombo on June 24 at 6 pm. as a fundraiser for building a Shirdi Sai Baba temple in Avissawella. This drama is produced by Sri Shirdi Baba Trust which has taken up the task of building the Baba temple.
Sai Nathane Varuga Varuga has been scripted, conceptualised and choreographed by Kala Suri Thivya Sujen. Sujen -- a devotee of Shirdi Baba herself -- captures and portrays the essence of Baba's life, teachings and philosophy. The Tamil lyrics are written in a simple and captivating style. Close to 40 dancers from Sri Lanka, Trichy and Vellore are being passionately trained by Sujen. She feels that at every step in this project she is being guided by Baba, and thus this is a project very close to her heart.
The music for this event has been composed by the eminent Violin Maestro Lalgudi GJR Krishnan. Krishnan feels the divine presence of the Guru in every note, and feels that it is a blessing to have been able to be a part of this project.
The common adage is that it is always the Guru who chooses the disciple -- thus, all the musicians who are featured in the recording are “Sai” devotees. This project was recorded in Chennai at Re sound India with leading artists and professionals. The head of the studio, Sai Sravanam, is an accomplished audio engineer and a sensitive musician rolled into one. The brilliant musicians who gave their best under the direction of Lalgudi GJR Krishnan are Mayavaram Viswanathan (mridangam), Ganapathy (mridangam & percussion), Srikanth Gopalakrishnan (vocal), Keerthana (vocal), Karthika (vocal), Padma Shankar (violin), Bavaniprasad (veena), Sruthisagar (flute), Enjikkudi Subramaniam (nadaswaram) and Kishore (sitar).
Sujen said that she is grateful to Sri Shirdi Baba Trust for this magical journey.
“Every one of us feel that we are fortunate to be a part of this production. I am extremely thankful to Lalgudi Krishnan, Sai Shravanam and all the musicians for their valuable contribution. We the dancers are really working hard to make the production a wholesome one.
The rasikas who are fortunate to witness this dance drama are bound to be transported to another world. The experience will be enriching, leaving `their eyes moist and their hearts full.
The task of building a temple for Shirdi Sai Baba is as formidable as it is noble. We hope to see you in large numbers and seek the support of each one of you to contribute your mite so that the dream of a temple becomes a reality soon," she added. -TS
