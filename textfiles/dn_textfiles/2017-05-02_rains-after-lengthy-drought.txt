Rains after lengthy drought

Heavy rains accompanied by thunder are expected in the afternoon in the next few days, according to the Meteorology Department.
Showers or thundershowers will occur at several places in the Western, Sabaragamuwa, Southern, Central, North-Central, North-Western, and Uva Provinces after 2 pm. Showers or thundershowers may occur at a few places elsewhere after 2 pm, the Department said. There may be temporary localised strong winds during thundershowers. The general public is requested to take adequate precautions to minimise damages caused by lightning activity.
