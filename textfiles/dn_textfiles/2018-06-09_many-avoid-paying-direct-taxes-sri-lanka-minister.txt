Many avoid paying direct taxes in Sri Lanka - Minister

More than 1.1 million people avoid paying direct taxes in Sri Lanka directly impacting on the economy, Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.
He said there are more than 1.5 million people who fall under category required to pay the income tax according to the per capita income in the country. However, there were only 0.4 million paying income tax at the moment. The Minister during a meeting held with industrialists and businessmen in Kegalle said the government policy is to gradually reduce imposing indirect taxes while increasing the direct tax.
He said further that the collection of direct tax has become a challenge due to people having no confidence in the procedure. "So there should be an awareness programme to make people aware of the importance of paying tax," Minister Siyambalapitiya said. The Minister said the word that entrepreneurs and businessmen hate to listen is the tax. "However this should be changed and they have to think of it as a responsibility," Minister Siyambalapitiya said.
