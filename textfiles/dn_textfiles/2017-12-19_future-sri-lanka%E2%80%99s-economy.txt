Future of Sri Lanka’s economy

The labour model in the country must be restructured in order for the country to move forward economically, said Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy at the Sri Lanka Economic Association (SLEA) last week. Further, he chastised both the government and the domestic private sectors for facilitating what he called deficits in both execution and trust, respectively.
He was speaking to members of the private and public sectors, gathered for a seminar organized by SLEA on the future direction of economic policy in the country. Graced by Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva, Coomaraswamy, Entrepreneur Samantha Kumarasinghe, and members of the leadership from SLEA, the seminar featured speeches by each of them. Representing the viewpoints of the government, the central bank, and the business community, each spoke for around twenty minutes and offered their complementary yet also competing ideas for the country’s economic future.
The Government Perspective
First up to speak was Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva, providing the government’s perspective on the country’s economic future. He began by pointing out that economic policy cannot be discussed in isolation, that economic policy is intrinsically impacted by and related to issues like the country’s foreign policy, trade relations, and domestic security.
On this note, he iterated the improvements made by the current government to the overall political situation, not just economic or financial, it inherited from the previous administration.
“When we came into office in 2015, things were not very rosy. On the international front, we had multiple challenges. We were about to be hauled into the International Criminal Court on war crimes, and our military was to be dragged into some sort of tribunal in the Hague. Also at the same time, it was imminent that various economic sanctions were to be imposed on us,” de Silva said.
“So on the foreign policy side, we made a complete U-turn, in terms of policies as well as international engagement.”
By bringing the international community on the side of the country, he said, Sri Lanka was able to regain its GSP plus status with the European Union, opening up duty-free access to the market for over 6,600 products.
Of the non-explicitly economic factors that contribute to a country’s positive economy, de Silva explained that this one is the first: creating peace in a sustainable way, which allows the country and its relations both domestically and internationally to progress.
The second factor he delineated was the need to provide the people of Sri Lanka with a sense of ownership over their own government. This, he said, along with creating peace, must be done as prerequisites for the economy to improve.
He stressed the efforts the government has taken, often underappreciated, he says, by the general public, to restore the trust, including the passage and implementation of Right to Information legislation, and the assurance of a free press.
After briefly touching on issues of problematic regulation, land ownership disputes and the need for Sri Lanka to continue moving in the direction of a tradable economy, de Silva concluded his speech by providing his view of what Sri Lanka’s economic future has in store.
“To me, we are not a South Asian country. We are an Indian Ocean country,” De Silva said. “And the government’s vision is clear: to make sure we are the centre of the Indian Ocean, where growth will take place over the next three to five decades.”
Central Bank Perspective
Speaking next was Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy, who provided more substance to de Silva’s testimony on government-rooted economic improvements in the past two years and specifically highlighted some recent positive economic news.
“The IMF (International Monetary Fund) successfully completed a review of our extended funding arrangement in the last week. The Hambantota deal was completed on Saturday.
There is now, in my view, better alignment between the government’s policy statement and the budget, which I think will make for more predictable and more consistent policies. There is foreign money flowing into the government securities market and this is accelerated in the last week or two. Foreign money has flown into the stock exchange,” Coomaraswamy said.
“All these seem to indicate that there is a certain improvement in the level of confidence in the Sri Lankan economy.”
Still, he said, there is no room for complacency if Sri Lanka is to achieve the economic development it hopes to.
To strengthen the macroeconomic fundamentals of the economy, he noted the government’s efforts regarding fiscal consolidation, intended to bring the budget deficit down to 3.5 percent of the GDP. He added that this year, for the first time in over half a century, there is a very good chance that the primary balance of the budget will be in surplus.
“If you take interest payments out, revenue will exceed expenditure. That is the first time this has happened, or will happen, since the early 1950s,” he said.
“I hope we can conclude from this that some of the structural deficiencies in the government budget are beginning to be addressed. Certainly the new Inland Revenue Act, the reforms to the VAT, are major continuity factors in terms of addressing the structural deficits that have been in the budget for many years now.”
Looking to the future, Coomaraswamy provided many policy suggestions for ways in which to improve the country’s economic landscape. He said the country needs to strengthen its Fiscal Responsibility Management Act, so that deviation from economic goals is limited only to extreme circumstances such as natural disasters or severe depressions and to remove para tariffs so that the country is no longer excluded from the global supply chain. Currently, only seven percent of Sri Lanka’s exports go through the global supply chain, versus 22 percent of exports from India, which is considered a closed economy. He also insisted that the country’s currency exchange rates be managed in a flexible and market oriented manner.
Regarding Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), Coomaraswamy insisted that the growth model must be private-sector driven.
“The state does not have the fiscal space to drive development,” he said. “This is not ideological. It’s a practical conclusion we have to reach.”
He also emphasized the need for a fundamental review of land mix and crop use.
“Can we not produce all our paddies in the dry zone and use the wet zone for higher quality produce?”
Central Bank Perspective on Labour
Coomaraswamy then spent the bulk of his remaining speech arguing for the country to re-evaluate the way its labour is regulated, utilized, and distributed.
According to Coomaraswamy, there is no labour shortage in the country as some claim, but instead, people are working in the wrong sectors, with too many working in agriculture. He cited a Harvard University study which states that an economy at Sri Lanka’s level of development should have no more than 15 percent of a its labour-force be agricultural. In Sri Lanka, the figure is 27 percent, while agriculture makes up just seven percent of the GDP. A third of the workforce lives below the poverty line.
“We are trapping people in low-productivity, low-income livelihoods in agriculture. By giving people free water, fertilizer subsidies, and a guaranteed price, people stay in agriculture and can’t go any further,” Coomaraswamy said.
He claimed that the incentive structures keeping people in these agricultural jobs must be re-evaluated, and that investment is required in higher-productivity, higher-income jobs in order to shift the labour force.
Similarly, Coomaraswamy also said there was a surplus of labour in the public sector, which accounts for about 17-18 percent of the total workforce.
“But again,” he said, “people are behaving very rationally. Because it is only the eighteen percent of the people in the public service who have a pension, a non contributive pension. So it’s absolutely rational behaviour for people to want a job in the public sector.”
He said that there are too many people in the public sector and that redistributing the labour force more intelligently would require that everyone have a pension. If this is to happen, he said, all pensions must become contributive.
Speaking of labour standards, Coomaraswamy said that labour laws and regulations actually produce unintended negative outcomes, leading to poorer working conditions overall.
“While the limited number of people in the former sector enjoy strong protection, what these labour laws do is reduce the overall labour standard in the economy,” he said.
“How does that happen? The firms in the formal sector get around the labour laws by casualizing employment. So we find all the big firms employ a significant amount of people on a casual basis where the labour laws don’t apply. That reduces the overall standard of labour.”
He maintained that a tripartite effort must bring together the government, private sector and labour unions to create a set of labour laws which protect workers but also create incentives for capital.
Concluding his speech, Coomaraswamy imparted upon the audience three main takeaways. The first is that Sri Lanka has the potential to be the only country in the world with preferential access to markets in India, China, and Europe through the GSP plus, a key differentiator between Sri Lanka and other countries trying to attract FDI. The second is that, in his view, the debate over the Hambantota Port deal has been framed poorly. He insisted that the deal is good for the people of the area, who will see their backyards and livelihoods transformed for the better by investment triggered by the deal. The same, he said, was true for a potential international port deal in Trincomalee.
And the final takeaway Coomaraswamy mentioned was twofold. According to him, the country is currently suffering from two main deficits. The government has an execution deficit, failing in the past to deliver on promises made and as a result the private sector has a deficit of trust in the government.
“There have been issues related to the consistency and predictability of policies. But in my view, that is being addressed. So now, it’s up to the private sector to recalibrate its risk appetite and to open their wallets and start to invest,” he said.
“In the next year to eighteen months, it’s the domestic private sector that has to take the lead. And I think, hopefully, the conditions are being created for them to do that.”
Private Sector Perspective
Coomaraswamy’s reference to the domestic private sector was a fitting prelude to the evening’s third and final speaker, Entrepreneur Samantha Kumarasinghe, the founder of Nature’s Beauty Creations Cosmetics. Despite the previous testimonies of both de Silva and Coomaraswamy, Kumarasinghe harshly criticized the current government’s economic policies. Specifically, he chastised the current government for how it relates to and facilitates private sector entrepreneurship.
“I have questioned whether consecutive governments have listened to the private sector when making economic decisions,” he said. Comparing the previous regime with the current one, Kumarasinghe insisted that the current government has vastly underperformed in its duty to easing the burden on the private sector.
“At present they pretend to listen, but go and do the total opposite.”
He criticized the government for what he alleges are failures of various trade agreements including ISFTA (Indo-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement), PSFTA (Pakistan Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement), CEPA (Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement), and ETCA (Economic & Technology Cooperation Agreement), to bring positive results to Sri Lanka, claiming that it neglected to properly consult private sector stakeholders.
He then mentioned Sri Lanka’s impending free trade agreement with China, which he chastised, saying that it will only benefit four or five apparel export companies while harming “all other industrialists amounting to over 50,000 entrepreneurs and over one million employees.”
Moving along, he outlined what he views as wrong economic decisions which he claims have led to a foreign exchange crisis, including 1) that most lucrative trading opportunities are given to foreigners, 2) excessive imports of vehicles and fuel by consecutive governments, 3) and poor management of the Central Bank.
Clashing with de Silva and Coomaraswamy, Kumarasinghe harshly criticised “giving away Hambantota Port,” which he called the most strategic asset in Sri Lanka. And, rooted in his own experience in the cosmetics industry, he critiqued the government for deregulating the cosmetics industry in 2015, which allowed the markets to be flooded with toxic products and reduced international demand for Sri Lankan cosmetic exports as a result.
Concluding, Kumarasinghe insisted that no country can be developed by following the instructions of the IMF and the World Bank to the last letter. Instead, he insisted that the domestic private sector would be able to lead the way as long as they are listened to.
“We must find and have our own home-made domestic formula to develop the economy by facilitating local entrepreneurs,” he said.
