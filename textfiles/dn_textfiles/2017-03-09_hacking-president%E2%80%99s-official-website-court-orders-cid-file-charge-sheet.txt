Hacking of President’s official website; Court orders CID to file charge sheet

The Colombo Chief Magistrate yesterday ordered the CID to file a charge sheet against two suspects including a 17-year-old schoolboy in connection with alleged securing an unauthorised access into the President’s official website.
At a previous occasion, the schoolboy was ordered to be placed under the supervision of the probation officers for a three-year period by Colombo Chief Magistrate. The Court had issued this order taking into consideration a request made by the Department of Probation and Child Care Services.
Accordingly, the 17-year-old schoolboy would be supervised by probation officers for three-year period with the consent of the parents. The schoolboy and other suspect Dulan Amarasinghe, 27, are currently out on bail. The CID had alleged that the schoolboy residing in Kadugannawa area had intruded into the President’s official website www.president.gov.lkon on August 25 after altering its original data. A group calling itself the “Sri Lankan Youth” posted a statement in Sinhalese on the web page.
Defence Counsel Susantha Dodaawatta appeared on behalf of the schoolboy.
