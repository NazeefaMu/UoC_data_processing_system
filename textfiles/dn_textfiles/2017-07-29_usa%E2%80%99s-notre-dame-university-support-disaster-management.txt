USA’s Notre Dame University to support in disaster management

The University of Notre Dame of USA will implement the Monsoon Intra-Seasonal Oscillation-(MISCO) Inter-monsoon fluctuation in Sri Lanka to support in curbing human disasters due to weather conditions in Sri Lanka. This is a result of an agreement reached with the University by the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera in March 2017. It has been decided to establish a system of precise forecasting systems for all weather related issues, including rainfall, temperature changes, humidity, wind, warm and cold currents in the ocean etc.
A discussion in this regard was held on July 26 at the Ministry. Professor Harendra J. S. Fernando is in charge of the project. NARA is coordinating. A special aircraft is used in the implementation of the MISCO project. The equipment also monitors the temperature up to 10 kilometres from sea level and the wind speed two kilometres from sea level. All other matters, such as the cucle oceans are being considered.
The Minister stated that the government will provide all assistance to implement this project.
The project, which begins in 2018, ends in two years. However, the MISCO project is implemented between 2017 to 2022. Officials including the SL Navy and Meteorological Department participated in the discussion.
