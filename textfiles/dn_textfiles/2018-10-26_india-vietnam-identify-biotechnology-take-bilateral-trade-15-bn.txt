India, Vietnam identify biotechnology to take bilateral trade to $15 bn

NEW DELHI: India and Vietnam have identified biotechnology in agriculture and healthcare, super-computing and remote sensing, among other areas to drive bilateral trade to $15 billion by 2020, the government said on Wednesday.
“Vietnam requires technological assistance for its socio-economic and trade logistics development for which India is an appropriate partner,” commerce and industry ministry said in a statement.
Both countries have identified biotechnology in agriculture and healthcare, technology for new materials, IT and electronics, super-computing, nuclear energy for peaceful uses, science and technology, remote sensing and non-traditional energy for expanding trade and investment.
The issues are likely to be discussed at a meeting between Vietnam’s Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of Vietnam and Trade Promotion Council of India (TPCI). The two sides will discuss business opportunities and future cooperation between India and Vietnam as well as ways and means to promote Indusfood in Vietnam.
India-Vietnam bilateral trade was $7.8 billion in 2015-16 with India maintaining a positive trade balance. Economic Times
