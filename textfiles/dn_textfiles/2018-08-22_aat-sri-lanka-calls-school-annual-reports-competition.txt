AAT Sri Lanka calls for School  Annual Reports competition

With the collaboration of the Ministry of Education, AAT Sri Lanka is organizing the Best Annual Reports Competition 2018 for the 11th consecutive year.
The award ceremony will be held at the BMICH on November 27, 2018.
The preliminary steps of communicating the criteria and the rules and regulations of the competition to schools have been completed by now and, Guide-line manuals incorporating the details have been posted to the schools already.
The Organizing Committee believes that this is a valuable opportunity for School Development Societies to sharpen their analytical skills that provide a platform to display transparency, accountability and best practices from school level. This year too, this contest has accepted entries from National Schools in Sri Lanka, as well as from Provincial level schools where A/L stream academics are conducted, and this initiative has enabled more than 2800 to get eligible to this all island competition, making the competition much more intense than ever before.
Three National Level Prizes, Gold, Silver and Bronze would be awarded and Nine (09) awards for “Best Presented Report” at provincial level. District level first, second, and third awards would be selected in two categories, schools having more than 1,000 students and those with less than 1,000 students. Minister of Education, Akila Viraj Kariyawasam will be the Chief Guest while Sunil Hettiarachchi – Secretary, Ministry of Education as the Guest of Honour.
