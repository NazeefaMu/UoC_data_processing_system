Ramazan Ifthar program at Lyceum Kurunegala

We are today living in a multi-racial, multi-religious, and multi-cultural society. To live in harmony, peace and friendship, it is important that we understand each other traditions and faiths and religions. This concept has been taken up by the management of Lyceum International School – Kurunegala. A grand Ramazan Ifthar program was held at Lyceum Adventure Park , Kurunegala recently to mark the Ramazan festival season.
