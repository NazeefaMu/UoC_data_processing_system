Indonesia fireworks factory explosion kills dozens

 
At least 23 people have been killed and dozens injured after an explosion and fire at an Indonesian fireworks factory, the Police said.
The blaze took hold at around 09:00 local time (02:00 GMT), at an industrial complex in Tangerang, west of the capital Jakarta.
"We are still evacuating victims," Tangerang Kota police chief Harry Kurniawan told AFP.
Television footage showed thick smoke pouring from the factory.
The blaze has been brought under control, but the exact number of casualties is still being confirmed.
"There are 103 workers in total working for this factory," Nico Afinta, director of general crime at Jakarta Police, told Indonesia's Kompas TV.
He said 43 people had been injured and were being treated in three hospitals, and that the remains of 23 victims had been found.
Parts of the building collapsed after the fire swept through, and nearby cars were burned out.
A local government official told Metro TV the factory had only been running for six weeks.
