Larger ships to be Port of Oakland’s new normal

The trend of larger ships calling at the Port of Oakland recorded during the first half of 2017 is expected to become the new normal at the port, especially in the light of the latest infrastructural investments allowing for the handling of bigger ships.
“Ship size is increasing in Oakland. Average size vessel here was 8,000 TEU. Moving now toward 14,000 TEU. In a few years, it’ll be 18,000 TEU. Oakland is handling larger ships without difficulty. Carriers don’t hesitate to call with bigger ships. After the obvious infrastructure requirements: 50-foot depth, heightened ship-to-shore cranes; the key is cargo-handling performance. Transformation in our marine terminals allows Oakland to work big ships efficiently and deliver cargo promptly,” Michael Zampa, Port of Oakland’s Communications Director, said while speaking to World Maritime News.
Just two years ago, the port was battling congestion issues arising from waterfront contract talks between the Pacific Maritime Association (PMA) and the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU).
Today, Port of Oakland’s Maritime Director John Driscoll boasts of top port productivity among West Coast rivals with 35-to-40 container moves per hour during vessel operations, and ships spending 24 hours, or less, at berth. World Maritime News
