Water from Yan Oya Project for 20,000 acres by mid 2020

Water will be released to nearly 20,000 acres of paddy fields under the Yan Oya reservoir in mid 2020 following the filling of the reservoir.
Delay in resettling evacuated families under the Yan Oya reservoir resulted in postponing filling of the reservoir for nearly one year.
Project Director Engineer Udaya Hemakumara told Daily News that the Yan Oya river is the main water source for feeding the Yan oya reservoir.
The main dam across the river is about three km long. Its construction work commenced in 2014 and 95 percent of head work was completed by the Chinese CAMC Company in 2017 except filling the river mouth. Recently, filling this part was commenced and once the task is over, the main dam will be fully complete, Hemakumara said.
Constructing the south bank main canal was carried out by the Irrigation Department. Its length is about 12 kms. The left bank main canal runs about 20 kms. It gets water from the Yan Oya reservoir at eight cubic meters of water per second.
About 20 small tanks by the two canals provide irrigational water to medium scale tanks including Jayanthiwewa, Huruluwewa, and D8 tank among others.
"The Chinese CAMC Engineering Company built the reservoir's main dam and it also carries out head works of South bank main canals. The project costs Rs. 65,000 million.
Several dilapidated tanks along the canal banks will be renovated too under the project.
Hemakumara said test filling of the reservoir will begin in the year end during the monsoon rains. As water is released, 250 acres of paddy land at the Maha Sorowwa (Main sluice) will get water from the reservoir.
The Project Director said the constriction work would end by mid 2020 and water will be released via the two canals for 2,000 acres of paddy fields. "We will accelerate resettlement programme. It got delayed due to many reasons. Interviews are now held to pay compensation for the evacuated families. They will be provided with "Ahimi Kanna Wandi" for 2017/18 Maha season - Rs. 35,000 per acre," he said.
