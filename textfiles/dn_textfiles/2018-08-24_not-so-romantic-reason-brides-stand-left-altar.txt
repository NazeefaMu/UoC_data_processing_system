Not-so-romantic reason brides stand on the left at the altar

Most girls dream of their wedding day with delight. But back in the 16th century it was a day to perhaps dread for most brides.
In today's world, not many ponder much about where the bride and groom are situated at the altar. However, back in the day in Britain, it was a strategic move.
Grooms would kidnap women from the local community to marry, The Sun reported. The bride would be snatched with no clue and brought to the groom for the ceremony.
During the ceremony, she would always stand on the left while he was on her right. This was so he could draw his sword in case people tried to come rescue her or if other suitors attempted to fight for her.
Which brings to mind the original role of the best man. The most accomplished swordsman was picked for this role to kidnap the bride and stand guard during the ceremony.
