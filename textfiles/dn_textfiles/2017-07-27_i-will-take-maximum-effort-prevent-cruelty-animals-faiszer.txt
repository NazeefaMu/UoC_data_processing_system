I will take maximum effort to prevent cruelty to animals: Faiszer

Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha said he would take maximum effort to prevent cruelty to animals.
The minister made this observation when he met representatives of organisations campaigning for the prevention of cruelty to animals at the ministry.
The representatives arrived in a protest march against the killing of stray dogs in the Sri Jayawardenapura and Moratuwa campuses.
The minister said that there is an organised campaign to blame and discredit him with regard to stray dogs being killed in the country. He said, "I am used to brick brats as well as praise being showered on me.
This is a Sinhala Buddhist country. If animals are slaughtered, it is essential to complain to the authorities to conduct an investigation into the matter.
There are provisions in the law to investigate such matters." Minister Musthapha said holding placards and chanting slogans on the streets will not solve the problem.
"Anyone can make representations and have discussions on the issues with me," he said.
