Rationalise vehicles through effective measures

According to news reports, the President has suspended the recent supplementary estimate for purchase of vehicles for politicians apparently to rectify the bad timing of the proposal in the face of the flood catastrophe. If it is only a postponement of the issue, we urge the policymakers to make use of the recess to install a transparent and an effective mechanism to rationalise the purchase and usage of vehicles for politicians and government officials in the long run.
The writer in his previous submissions has repeatedly drawn the attention of the authorities that with the advent of the decentralised Provincial Councils in 1987, the sole responsibilities of central government MPs should have been redefined in order to make them only lawmakers or legislators confined to the centre. Therefore, effective steps should be taken at least now to clearly redefine job roles of the central parliamentarians, provincial councillors and local government members.
Also, usage of pool vehicles in the ministries should be maximised to cater to demands from parliamentarians. These measures will no doubt reduce the official travel of central parliamentarians to the periphery using luxury vehicles.
It is pertinent to mention that the absence of clearly defined roles was quite evident in the recent school re-opening mess-up as well as in the seemingly lukewarm role played by the provincial and local government politicians during the flood disaster. The media culture on the other hand too needs to be changed to shift the limelight from the Central parliamentarians to their peripheral counterparts so that the public can assess and justify the presence and effectiveness of politicians in the periphery.
We still hold the hope that only a government committed to good governance can rationalise and institute cost-effective and productive political machinery in Sri Lanka and accelerate the developmental process of our country. Thus, we urge the civil society and concerned organisations to guide the Yahapalana government on the correct path.
