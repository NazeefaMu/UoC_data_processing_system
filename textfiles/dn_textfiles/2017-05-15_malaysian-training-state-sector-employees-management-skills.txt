Malaysian training for state sector employees in management skills

The Malaysian Government yesterday promised to provide more training opportunities to Sri Lanka’s state sector workers to improve their management skills under its technical cooperation programme.
Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak promised the above when he met his Sri Lankan counterpart Ranil Wickremesinghe on the sidelines of the ‘One Belt, One Road’ summit in Beijing, China yesterday.
During talks, Prime Minister Razak told Premier Wickremesinghe that further strengthening the already robust ties between the two countries was his aim.
The leaders also discussed the benefits the two countries can gain through the ‘One Belt, One Road’ concept.
The possibility of a free trade agreement between the two countries was also discussed. An agreement was reached to further pursue the matter without delay.
