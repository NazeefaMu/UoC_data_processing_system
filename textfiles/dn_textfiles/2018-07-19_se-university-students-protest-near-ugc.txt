SE University students protest near UGC

Police yesterday closed Ward Place after a group of students attached to the South Eastern University staged a protest opposite the University Grants Commission demanding the government to solve their issues.
Traffic on Ward Place came to a standstill when students blocked the road opposite the UGC.
They said the university administration had begun unleashing violence on the students who voiced their problems. Later they held a Satyagraha as they were not given any opportunity to dicuss their issues with Ministry officials.
