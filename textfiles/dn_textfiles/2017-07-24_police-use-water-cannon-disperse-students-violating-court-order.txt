Police use water cannon to disperse students violating court order

Police arrested 13 medical faculty undergraduates for conducting a Satyagraha against the SAITM in violation of a Court order prohibiting any Satyagraha and demonstration at Lipton Circus yesterday.
The students who were engaged in the Satyagraha by building a temporary shed, were demanding the protection of State education and the abolishing of SAITM. Officers of the Police Riot Control Unit who arrived at Lipton Circus, later fired water cannons to disperse the students who were engaged in the Satyagraha ignoring the Court Order issued by the Fort Magistrate.
Several students were injured following the water cannon attack, while the temporary shed was completely demolished.
The 13 Medical students who were arrested were granted bail by the Colombo Magistrate.
