Singer introduces Senasuma Plus

Singer, one of the the largest consumer durables retailer in Sri Lanka, is to introduce Senasuma Plus a pioneering warranty and safeguard for all products to its customers. Senasuma Plus is a unique plan that offers Singer customers an extended manufacturing warranty of two years and also covers their appliances against natural disasters and fire.
Senasuma Plus is available for products purchased from any Singer outlet island wide and is the first of its kind to be introduced in Sri Lanka.
Senasuma Plus is an upgrade on Senasuma, the extended warranty scheme available to Singer customers for a nominal fee at the point of purchase (since 2008). Senasuma is available to customers who purchase a product from a Singer outlet, offering them the opportunity to extend the manufacturing warranty on the product purchased by a further two years, in addition to the one-year guarantee offered on all products by Singer. Thus, for three full years, customers can avail themselves of repairs/services and genuine spares for free through the warranty scheme.
Improving upon this, Senasuma Plus further offers customers the opportunity to cover their product against fire, lightning and natural disasters such as floods and cyclones. It also provides cover against electrical surges, explosions and burglaries. Senasuma Plus will only be available to customers who pay via cash or credit card.
Singer has partnered with Amana Takaful, the leading Takaful insurance solutions provider in Sri Lanka to support Senasuma Plus coverage. Amana Takaful provides an extensive range of products and services enabling both its commercial and personal clients to manage any risk with confidence. The company operates an island wide network of 26 branches, 300 third-party centres as well as a direct sales force.
During its 140-year long journey in Sri Lanka, Singer has touched the hearts of generations of Lankans, through a range of products and services that have an unrivalled presence in households and institutions, meeting the needs of its discerning customers. Senasuma Plus is yet another feature that provides additional peace of mind.
