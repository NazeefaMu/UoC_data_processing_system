Enjoy Valentine’s Day at Cinnamon Lakeside

With the ‘day of love’ just around the corner, the Cinnamon Lakeside has lined up distinct culinary events to make every star-crossed lover swoon. The hotel's poolside will be transformed in to a magical candlelight dinner venue serving the very best of gastronomic wonders.
This exclusive dinner for two entails a personal butler to take care of the love birds and a four course menu with each course thoughtfully prepared by the hotel's culinary team to be enjoyed.
A bottle of sparkling and a box of signature truffles featuring 100 handcrafted chocolates are also part of this enchanting evening.
The menu will include macadamia crusted goose liver pate on peppered peach chutney, Cajun smoked chicken on roasted turnip mash with pomegranate glaze, seared rock lobster on celery salad served with mango relish, vodka cured Tasmanian salmon with dill champagne reduction and caviar froth, anise scented pumpkin soup and green pea cappuccino, and quail consommé with duck dumpling. Slow roasted lamb saddle with tamarind kumquat marmalade, braised lamb neck served chestnuts and field mushrooms, smoky bacon foam, pickled balsamic shallot jus and potato fondant and wakami crusted fillet of sea bass with abalone dumpling, served with light saffron cream, tempura baby zucchini and baked caponata of purple yam rosti are some of the other dishes available, alongside dessert.
Colombo's only picturesque floating restaurant8 Degrees on the Lake will host yet another unique experience, with a special dinner menu and dancing on the deck.
With live entertainment, complementary bottle of sparkling and a cocktail bar, this is ideal for couples who yearn for a getaway from the constant buzz of the city life.
