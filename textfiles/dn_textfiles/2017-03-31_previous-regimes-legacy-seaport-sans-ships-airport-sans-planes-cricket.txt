Previous regime's legacy: Seaport sans ships, airport sans planes, cricket ground sans cricketers: Sajith

A seaport without ships, an airport without planes and an international cricket ground without cricketers, were built by the previous regime, Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa said addressing a meeting at Lunugamwehera.
The play ground at Suriyawewa was set up by clearing a jungle.
This led to the increase of the human-elephant conflict, he said.
The minister said the seaport, the airport and the playground became white elephants as they were set up without an environment assessment and a feasibility report.
Minister Premadasa said the Mahaweli project led to the clearance of a large extent of land, but the then government relocated wild elephants in safe locations.
