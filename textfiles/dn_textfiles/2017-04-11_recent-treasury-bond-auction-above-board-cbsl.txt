Recent Treasury Bond auction above  board - CBSL

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) clarifying its position on ‘misinterpretations’ reported by certain electronic media in relation to the recent auction of Treasury Bonds held on April 4 said it has maintained the best market practices of limiting the acceptances to the offered amount in aggregate terms in the primary issuance of government securities.
The auction was announced to issue Rs. 11.5 billion of Treasury bonds under three maturities viz. 04 years 08 months, 06 years 09 months and 09 years 04 months offering Rs. 4.0 billion, Rs. 4.0 billion and Rs. 3.5 billion, respectively.
At the auction held on Tuesday, the Tender Board decided to accept bids totalling Rs. 11.48 billion vis-à-vis the aggregate offered amount of Rs.11.50 billion thereby maintaining the accepted amount almost equal to the offered amount.
“Accordingly, CBSL wishes to reconfirm that it has maintained the best market practices of limiting the acceptances to the offered amount in aggregate terms in the primary issuance of government securities,” the Bank said in a statement.
