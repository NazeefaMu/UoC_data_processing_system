‘JO confident of  NCM victory’

The Joint Opposition (JO) is confident of winning the No-confidence Motion (NCM) against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, JO member and Parliamentarian Dinesh Gunewardene said.
He was addressing the media in Colombo, yesterday.
Gunewardene said the JO was expecting support from United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) and Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) members within the government, as well as the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) and certain United National Party (UNP) members.
Meanwhile, MP Udaya Gammanpila said there was a possibility that at least two SLFP members would vote against the NCM. However, the JO was now working to get their support as well.
Meanwhile, a JO member said that its parliament members would hold a meeting with former President and Kurunegala District MP Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday evening, to further discuss the NCM.-
