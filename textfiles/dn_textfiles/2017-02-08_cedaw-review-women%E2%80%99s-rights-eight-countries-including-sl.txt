CEDAW to review women’s rights in eight countries, including SL

 
The UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) will meet in Geneva this month to review women’s rights in eight countries, including Sri Lanka.
Ukraine, Ireland, Jordan, El Salvador, Germany, Rwanda and Micronesia are other counties which women’s rights will be reviewed on February 13 to March 3.
These countries have ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and are reviewed regularly by CEDAW on how they are implementing the Convention.
The Committee, which is composed of 23 international independent experts, will hold dialogues with delegations from the respective governments and will also be briefed by NGOs and national human rights institutions.
