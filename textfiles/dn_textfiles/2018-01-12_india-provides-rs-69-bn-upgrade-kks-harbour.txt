India provides Rs. 6.9 bn to upgrade KKS Harbour

India provides US $ 45.27 million (LKR 6.9 billion) to upgrade Kankesanthurai (KKS) Harbour and the agreement in this regard was signed on January 10 in New Delhi by Export-Import Bank of India Managing Director David Rasquinha and the Secretary to Treasury of Sri Lanka.
The project would make KKS Harbour a full-fledged commercial port further strengthening Sri Lanka’s efforts to become a regional maritime hub. It would assist in reconstruction efforts in the northern Sri Lanka as well.
An MoU between India and Sri Lanka was signed earlier to rehabilitate the harbour and preparing Detailed Project Report (DPR), carrying out geo-technical studies, removing wreck and disposal, dredging and conducting hydrographic survey were done under it.
Remaining phases - rehabilitating the breakwater and existing pier, constructing a new pier for commercial cargo, and installing port infrastructure facilities among others will be carried out via the latest financial assistance.
