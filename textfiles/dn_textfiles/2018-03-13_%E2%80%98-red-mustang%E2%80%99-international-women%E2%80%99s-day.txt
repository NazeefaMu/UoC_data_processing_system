‘The Red Mustang’ for International Women’s Day

The film ‘The Red Mustang’ will be screening on March 13 at the Alliance Française de Kotte at 7 pm.
The film by Rehan Alexander Mudannayake is a dark, suspenseful drama that tackles topical themes of sexual harassment, and the abuse and manipulation of power. The film follows a young, desperate graduate who gets
more than she bargains for when she goes for an interview with a powerful company CEO. It’s the first ever Sri Lankan fiction film to discuss sexual harassment, and addresses many of the inequities that women encounter here in South Asia and the world over.
Debate moderated by Kinita Shenoy with the crew of ‘The Red Mustang’ Rehan Alexander Mudannayake, Francesca Mudannayake, and Dulika Jayamanne will follow.
