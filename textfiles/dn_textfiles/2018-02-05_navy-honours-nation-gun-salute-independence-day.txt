Navy honours nation with gun salute on Independence Day

The Sri Lanka Navy accorded a 25-gun salute to the nation at the Lighthouse premises in Colombo Fort at 12.00 p.m. to mark the 70th Independence Day yesterday. The Gun Salute, which executed the tradition to military precision befitting the occasion, was commanded by Gunnery Officer SLNS Parakrama, Lieutenant Commander Chandima Shantha in the presence of its Commanding Officer Captain Anil Bowatte and Executive Officer, Commander Samantha. In 1948, the Navy had fired a 15-gun salute at the Galle Face Green on the first Independence Day. In 1949, the Gun Salute had been accorded onboard HMCyS ‘Vijaya’, the Navy’s first warship. The Independence Day, Gunfire Salute is accorded to the nation by the Navy, at 1200 noon, continuing the time-honoured tradition.
