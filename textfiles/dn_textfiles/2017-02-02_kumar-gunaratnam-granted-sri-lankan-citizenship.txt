Kumar Gunaratnam granted Sri Lankan citizenship

 
Frontline Socialist Party Leader Kumar Gunaratnam was granted Sri Lankan citizenship, effective February 1, the Immigration and Emigration Department confirmed today (2).
Gunaratnam, a former JVP leader and political activist who is an Australian citizen, was arrested in January 2015 for overstaying his 30-day tourist visa, and served a year-long sentence at the Anuradhapura Prison.
Upon his release Gunaratnam said he was willing to give up his Australian citizenship, if the Sri Lanka government would approve his application and grant him Sri Lanka citizenship.
