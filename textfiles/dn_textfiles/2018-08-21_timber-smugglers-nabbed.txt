Two men were arrested by wildlife officers under the allegation of smuggling timber, during a raid conducted in the Kahalla - Pallekelle area in Galkiriyagama on Sunday.
A stock of teak timber and a lorry used in the transportation were taken into the custody of wildlife officers in the Galkiriyagama wildlife range office.
