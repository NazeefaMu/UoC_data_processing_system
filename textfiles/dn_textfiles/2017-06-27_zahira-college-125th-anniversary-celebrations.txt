Zahira College 125th anniversary celebrations

To mark 125 years, Zahira College marches forward with celebrations in the form of a Walk inviting all the present and the past students as well as parents to be a part of this parade. Zahira Walk 2017 is scheduled to take place on Saturday July 29 at 7 am starting from the College premises.
The Walk is being organised by the Old Boys’ Association with the cooperation of the school and the assistance of all the associated bodies of the college. The event will feature a number of groups, batches, societies and clubs presenting a unique theme to add colour to the walk.
The last Zahira walk was in 2012 celebrating the 120th anniversary of the school. It was a great success. Therefore this year’s walk is going to be much more grander and will draw a larger number of participants. Even the route of the walk is extended.
The organizing committee has planned out the full details of the walk. Specially designed walk T shirt and cap will be worn by all participants.
Zahira College was founded in 1892 with 35 students. It has around 5500 students studying in all three media with a staff of 275 today. Over the years the college has excelled in education as well as in co-curricular activities and produced many intellectuals and prominent personalities who have served the community and the country. Zahira College founders M.C. Siddi Lebbe, A.M. Wappiche Marikar, I.L.M. Abdul Aziz, and Orabi Pasha should be appreciated for their efforts in establishing a school which back many prominent individuals to the society.
