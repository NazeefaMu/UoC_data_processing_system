Depression over Bay of Bengal likely to move away

 
The low-pressure area in the central Bay of Bengal to the Northeast of the island is likely to develop further in to a depression and move away from the island, the Meteorological Department said.
Cloudy conditions are expected to continue further and fairly strong winds can be expected over the island and surrounding sea areas during next few days.
Showers or thundershowers at times are expected in Western, Sabaragamuwa, Central and North-Westernprovinces and in Galle and Matara districts and fairly heavy falls of above 50 mm can be expected at some places.
Several spells of showers or thundershowers will occur in Northern and North-central provinces and in the Trincomalee and Batticaloa districts, the Meteorological Department said.
It said there may be temporary localized strong winds during thundershowers and warned the general public to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by lightning activity.
