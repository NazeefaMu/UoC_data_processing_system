Annual Thomian Dinner Dance on October 13

The annual Thomian Dinner Dance organised by the Old Boys Association of S.Thomas’ College Mount Lavinia will be held on October 13 at the Hilton Colombo Grand Ballroom.
The Thomian Dance is one of the few Black Tie events in the country and has successfully maintained its customary high standards and exclusivity over the years.
This is also an important social event in the global network of Old Boys and many make it a point to attend as this prestigious event brings together the corporate world of Sri Lanka and a host of other dignitaries under one common umbrella.
The purpose of this dance is to fund the Bishop Chapman Scholarship, which helps students in need of financial assistance to complete their education at S.Thomas’. This fund, inaugurated in memory of Bishop Chapman in 1963, is a fitting tribute to the outstanding scholar of Kings College Cambridge and Master of Eton College who moulded S. Thomas’ College on the esteemed traditions of Eton. Even the school colours Blue, Black and Blue are the colours of Eton.
The Thomian Dance 2017 is organised by the Class of 80. What is of special significance to this particular batch is the fact that the past Warden, Prof Indra de Soysa was from the Class of 80. The theme for the evening is “A Day at College” which will revolve around a “Time Table” divided into “Periods” and will be a trip down memory lane for all Old Thomians due to the undisputed fact that school days are the most remarkable and unforgettable tims of their lives.
All invitations for the dance were snapped up in a week and 550 Old Boys and guests along with two leading bands Misty & Black await Octber 13 with a great deal of anticipation especially due to the fnatastic prizes on offer during the dance.
The Hilton as always with their amazing spread of culinary delights is all set to tantalize the taste buds of the guests with a spectacular dinner and a traditional “Thomian Boarding” breakfast.
The night promises to exceed the expectations of all stakeholders involved as the Bishop Chapman Fund is expected to recieve a substantial boost from the proceeds of the dance.
