Second round survival and the gladiators standing tall

All is calm and wellness as the clubs switch radars for a strenuous second leg. Survival is the key...especially for the teams with injuries to key players, whose main focus is the fast track recovery for their club cause. Let's mention the Danushka Ranjan, most talented ...but sadly not in the middle for the Park club. Result - new centre combination of Niroshan and Hirantha, who well comprehend the top skills required, to have your no. 1 finishers job, handed to them. Add Dulaj to the rehabilitation list along with.Shenal Dias, and coach Llagga's friendly banter evaporates.
Havelocks, CR, and Navy have the keys to cause max damage; if they discover some stupendous belief and strategy to outplay Kandy, especially upfront...plans to outrun the backs will need special magic and Merlin's potion?
CR's coach must be confident of releasing the Ashan de Costa, Ishan Noor, Kanchana Ramanayake, and the growing consistency of Sasanka Ariyaratne. If there is the example of hard work and workrate...Ariyaratne is in a class of his own.
He sets fire to the theory about flankers who are big and powerful by changing the dynamics to quick, sharp and impact fitness, both in set and loose play. He is a pleasure to watch...for CR fans ... but an annoying all purpose marauder, who thrives on tackling and causing max damage to opponents, both in attack and defence. He stands tall for his team and is definitely on my 2016 all stars squad.
The buzz about Police stepped up with a hard win against Navy at Police Park. Good news to see Rehan Weerakoon back at no. 10 and sharp to the boot on many levels ...he is the ideal all round rugby player with skills to match.
The plan for the blue shirts to create a rush is much overdue ...especially with Reza Mubarak, Henry, Dabare, Sherrif, and the might of Bilal 'tank' Hassen. Facts are harsh and I imagine the knockouts already looming large, and the possibility of some reward for their considerable investment this Dialog season - perhaps some words with my buddy Marso might be valuable insight for all of us fans?
I am trying to understand the wisdom of the player transfer system ...where the club holds the contractual right to decide on shifting mid season. If the current club agrees to release a player ... then he is legal to play the next weekend.
The grapevine is buzzing with Danushka Ranjan news bytes about a move away from Colombo ... but futile rhetoric, given his injury status that is more damage than anticipated, possibly a few months to rehab and recover?
On the bigger picture ...we need your island rugby experts, to start making lists of whom you think will make the grade for Sri Lanka in the Asian Championships this March.
Can we match Hong Kong, China, South Korea and the mighty high flying Asian giant and world's fav team, Japan? Can Sri beef up a pack heavy enough to hold them in the sets for starters?
Coach Eddie Jones already signed with ailing, smarting, and deeply concerned England for the next World Cup. If Jones can transform and revive a flagging RFU confidence and revamp the system ...is the question burning news wires in London. Twickenham is still lukewarm for the looming six nations grudge series.
My bet is on an Irish campaign that will smash defences and earn them new respect. Scotland will be oozing confidence and itching to run the ball from all corners ...they certainly have the firepower and balance upfront at Murrayfeild, to outplay the best on their day; recovered skills for skipper Laidlaw... bigger, better ...faster ... will this be the year the Scots set their own history and emerge as a world class XV? ...postulating pundits and rugby all rounders pls ponders!
The subject of union affairs starts to do the legal rounds, with questions about the composition of teams, both senior and junior national squads ...coaching staff, management and player environment issues ...all part of the way forward.
Responsibility must be to establish a firm plan for the next 4 years ...target the priorities for 15s and 7s, and framework the whole blueprint.
I mentioned the wealth of homegrown experience that can be given scope and opportunity, from grassroots to national level.
The government must consider the phenomenon of rugby ...only second to cricket in Sri....harness the wealth of strong skilled young island men and women for our future, invest nurture and nourish mind and body. I believe we need to create a new generation of true island rugby players, fabulous examples of talented, skilled, strong, powerful, young Sri Warriors to impact Asia and then capture the imagination of the world.
Belief ...planning, investment, acumen, intellectual capacity and a burning desire to be the best ... a perfect platform to launch from.
Expectations are high!
Leaguewise ...Kandy are still untouched at the top and having a dream run with seven wins on the trot ...massive for coach Sean on debut as head coach. If destiny and high performance fitness clock in ...then only Havelock's and CR have fading hopes of derailing the Nittawela express that has been outstanding, and outplayed all comers in all departments.
Kandy's ability and skill set has been their focus for the full 80...a relentless hardwork ethic, quality players and team spirit, despite the odds.
Big hand to all coaching and management for the quality and performance level of all the teams in the Dialog league this season ... may it grow in skill, power and stature.
Bula bula the island players who carry a nations pride, long may it lead and prosper!
