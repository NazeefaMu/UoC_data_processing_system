NAITA Motor Engineering courses:
New National Competency Standard from today

The modernised National Competency Standard for Motor Engineering training courses formulated by the National Apprenticeship and Industrial Training Authority (NAITA), will be introduced at a ceremony tomorrow, at NAITA’s Kenimadala Auditorium at No. 971, Sri Jayewardenepura, Welikada, Rajagiriya.
This is part of the process to formulate national competence standards for the Vocational Training Sector, undertaken by NAITA.
The publicity and media unit of NAITA said the new standards for the motor engineering were keeping with the modern developments in the sector. Its curriculum covers vehicle air conditioning, tinkering, welding, cushion work, construction equipment, outboard boat engines, internal cleansing, and tyre fixing.
State and private sector entrepreneurs, industrialists, university doors, as well as other consultants in the relevant fields are assisting NAITA in revising the national competence standards.
