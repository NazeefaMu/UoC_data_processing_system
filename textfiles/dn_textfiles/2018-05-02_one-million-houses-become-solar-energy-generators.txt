One million houses to become solar energy generators

Our endeavour is to transform the roofs of one million houses in the country into solar energy generators, Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.
He was addressing the gathering after providing solar energy panels to the Main Muslim Jumma Mosque at Palliporuwa, Hemmathagama on April 28.
Minister Siyambalapitiya said providing solar energy is a step in the right direction, taken the national interest into account.
The programme will be expedited, dubbing it a ‘solar energy war’.
“Although hydrel reservoirs, coal and fuel were used to generate electricity, we have been far behind in tapping solar power for electricity.
“As such, priority had now been given for utilising solar power to generate electricity. Solar energy panels will be provided to places of religious worship in an effort to create awareness among people to set up such panels in their houses,” he said.
Muslim Mowlavis, officers of the Hemmathagama police station and the Grama Niladhari were among the large gathering present.
