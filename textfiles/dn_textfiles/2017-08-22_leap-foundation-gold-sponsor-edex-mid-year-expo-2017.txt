LEAP Foundation  Gold Sponsor EDEX  Mid-Year Expo 2017

The LEAP Foundation will be a Gold Sponsor at EDEX Mid-Year Expo 2017 signifying its commitment to support an initiative which creates a platform for youth to explore the many opportunities that are available to them in terms of education and career paths.
LEAP Foundation is a CSR initiative powered by ESOFT, Sri Lanka's largest private sector higher education network, aimed at offering financial assistance to deserving and capable students who have difficulties financing their higher education.
This island-wide initiative is open to young people from across Sri Lanka with each district being assigned a quota.
Selected candidates follow ESOFT’s established academic pathway to obtain an internationally recognised 2-year HND followed by a 1-year Top-up degree from London Metropolitan University (UK) specialising in areas such as Computing, Software Engineering or Networking.
In addition to complete financial assistance with an extended payment plan for higher studies, LEAP candidates also receive support for job placements and thereby benefit from greater employment opportunities both during and after the completion of their undergraduate degree.
ESOFT is also involved in many other CSR projects throughout the country including “eThilina” which provides computer labs to rural schools and “Little Hearts” which aims to construct a Cardiac and Critical Care Complex at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children. ESOFT additionally helps organise national competitions such as IT Mastermind which is geared towards actively improving the IT knowledge of children in the country.
EDEX Mid-Year Expo 2017, organised by the Royal College Union will be held at the Sri Lanka Exhibition and Convention Centre (SLECC).
