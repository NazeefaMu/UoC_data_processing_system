Ketchimalai:Historical and religious place of Muslim worship

Ketchimalai in Beruwela is a mount where the monument and Maqbara of His Holiness Sheik Ashraff Walliyullahs is enshrined. Muslims consider the place as a great historical and religious place of worship, where they pay regular visits and perform Zikr.
Today marks the completion of the narration of Hadees of the Prophet, culminating with the Ziyarath and feast in the name of this great saint. While Muslims have had the blessings of all governments to make this great feast of Beruwala a unique event, the Mosque situated on the Hill top of “Ketchimale” as per description in the famous book “Silk Route” by Ibn Batuta has a history dating back to the 14th century when the original Muslims settled down in Beruwala and His holiness Saint Ash Sheik Ashraff Walliyullahs whose shrines is now at this mosque is one among them.
It the year 1882, the then Governor of Sri Lanka Sir Arthur Henry Gordon on an official visit to Galle, the horse he was riding on suddenly (on its own), changed the usual route at Beruwala and took to the present Customs road and knelt down at the foot steps of an old shrine on top of the hill, (which is presently known as Ketchimalai) and refused to move. The Governor was so taken aback that he felt that there was some spiritual significance attached to the place.
The feast that is held here is common for all Muslims, irrespective of any sects and therefore is patronized by Muslims from all parts of the island. Incidentally the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation(SLBC) relays this event uninterrupted since 1951. It is worthy of mentioning the importance of the mosque where annual Majlees take place.
