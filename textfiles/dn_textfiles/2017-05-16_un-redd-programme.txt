The UN-REDD Programme

 The UN-REDD Programme, which is the United Nations collaborative initiative on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD), is currently supporting 64 developing countries with preparing and implementing forest-based national strategies aimed at combatting the threat of climate change. This global programme was launched by the UN in 2008 and builds on the convening role and technical expertise of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). Completed as a 5 year, US $ 99 million strategy, financed mainly through international sources, NRIFAP provides 13 specific forest-centric policies and measures for implementation by the Government of Sri Lanka. Here the first copy of this document is being handed over to President, Maithripala Sirisena.
