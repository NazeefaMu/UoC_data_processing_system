Govt. values efforts of  hospitality sector - Minister

Minister of Tourism and Christian Religious Affairs, John Amaratunga, addressed a gathering at the 47th AGM of Ceylon Hotel School Graduates Association (CHSGA).
It was held at Araliya Green City, a newly opened 5-star property in Nuwara Eliya, in which Samantha Gunarathne was re-elected as President for the second term.
Minister John Amaratunga in his address said, “Owners of hospitality establishments are among the largest investors in the tourism economy. In fact, the hospitality sub-sector is the backbone of tourism. Nothing creates a more lasting impression on tourists than their experience at their home-away-from-home place where they stay. The relationship between the Government and the hospitality providers is deep on many levels. It is the largest employer in the tourism sector, contributing significantly to reducing poverty and raising employment levels.”
“The Govt. values the efforts of the hospitality sector who in addition to supporting a wide range of livelihoods across the tourism value chain, are contributing to the GDP and helping to improve the lives of our people,” the minister added.
He also re-affirmed the support of his ministry to uplift the industry and assist CHSGA to put its plans into action.
The re-elected President Samantha Gunarathne said, “A legacy built over a period of 47 years, CHSGA has spread its hues all over Sri Lanka and the region. We started off with a simple and humble beginning and have moved on to our present status with our belief in dedication, hard work and vision. Today, we pride in our growth and unique hospitality culture.”
