New era dawns for Hambantota

The biggest news story from the past week, both in terms of politics and economics, was the US$ 1.1 billion agreement signed with a Chinese company for the management of the Hambantota Port, often described in the past as a white elephant. The deep-water port is located on Sri Lanka’s Southern coast, within just 10 nautical miles of the main Asia – Europe shipping route. It is also in a position along China’s ‘Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road’.

The Port eked out an existence as a transhipment venue for Roll on Roll off (RORO) car carriers, some of which unloaded cars for the local market as well. However, the volume of traffic was simply not enough to sustain the Port and pay the massive debts incurred by the previous regime for building it. Only a handful of vessels called over at the Port, which was ostensibly built to take advantage of the island’s strategic position on the East West sea route at least in terms of refuelling. This did not go exactly according to plan because today’s ships are very fuel efficient and do not need frequent fuel stops. Besides, Colombo was the preferred choice for most vessels, being among the top 30 ports in the world.
The problem for the National Unity Government was that a huge project such as Hambantota cannot be undone easily (the same goes for the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport). The challenge was to find a rationale and a means for maintaining the project, without straining the public purse if possible. The next best alternative was finding an investor or partner for the project that could possibly save the country millions of dollars in debt servicing. The Port which had accumulated a loss of 46.7 billion rupees since 2011 was also bleeding another 9,100 million rupees annually to service its foreign debt to China. The previous government had borrowed US$ 1.5 billion to build the port which the Chinese valued at US$ 1.4 billion raising certain questions about the transaction.
When the National Unity Government tried to implement a deal for the port earlier, there were protests orchestrated by the Opposition. Ironically, most of the Opposition figures themselves were responsible for creating the mess that is Hambantota Port in the first place. The fact they themselves had planned to sell off the Port to a Chinese company was conveniently forgotten. To the new Government’s credit, it acknowledged that certain clauses in the agreement could be tweaked and it did. The Government also ensured that India’s security and geopolitical concerns would be addressed in the new deal.
In the meantime, there was a change of Ministers as well and new Ports Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe worked hard to get the details right on the new agreement, which was signed last week in Colombo. Sri Lanka’s Navy will be in charge of security at the port while the agreement with China Merchants will be in line with Sri Lankan law.
The Sri Lankan Government has categorically said that its Navy will be the sole in-charge of security at the Hambantota Magampura Port. No foreign naval force will be allowed to use it as a base, the Government has said.
China Merchants Port Holdings (CM Port) and the Sri Lankan Government have agreed on a 99-year concession agreement worth US$1.12 billion, for the development, management and operation of Hambantota Port. From the total investment, the Chinese state-owned port operator will pay the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) US$ 974 m for a 70% stake in the Hambantota International Port Group (HIPG). Concerns that the port could be used by the Chinese military had delayed the deal but the Government has given assurances that China will run only commercial operations from the port which have allayed the concerns of India and other countries that China could use the Port for military purposes.
CM Port will use the remaining US$146 m for port and marine-related activities in Hambantota, as agreed with the Sri Lankan Government within one year of the final payment of the capital injection in HIPG. The agreement gives HIPG the sole and exclusive right to develop, operate and manage Hambantota Port and Hambantota International Port Services (HIPS) the sole and exclusive right to develop, operate and manage the common user facilities for the operation of the port. It is expected that the facility will be developed in three phases – the first two will have 10 berths and a quay length of up to 3,487 m, able to handle containers, bulk cargo, general cargo, roll-on roll-off (Ro-Ro) cargo and liquid bulk.
The international market reaction to the deal was overwhelmingly positive. The Government’s billion-dollar partnership with China to revive the loss-making Hambantota port will be credit positive for Sri Lanka and bolster investor confidence, the international ratings agency Moody’s said. It said the transaction will boost Sri Lanka’s foreign exchange reserves and ease the Government’s external liquidity position ahead of several large bond repayments between 2019 and 2022.
“Earnings from the Hambantota port stake sale will feed into the Central Bank’s foreign-exchange reserves, which will help bolster investor confidence and encourage future portfolio inflows,” Moody’s said in a report on Saturday’s deal.
Both the Joint Opposition and the JVP attacked the deal, describing it as a sell-out to China. Previously, many Ministers had commented on the behaviour of the Joint Opposition MPs who created a rumpus that disturbed the Parliamentary debate on the Hambantota Port deal. They charged that this was done deliberately to prevent sordid details of the previous Government’s Hambantota deals coming to light.
Shattered hopes of a new regime
Interestingly, Basil Rajapaksa of the Sri Lanka Podujana Party has gone on record as saying that a future Government led by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa would annul the agreement and take over the Port. Mahinda Rajapaksa himself has a very close relationship with China and Basil did not explain how exactly the Port would be taken over. It did not take long for Government Ministers and the media to pinpoint many instances where the former regime sold land outright to foreign parties – the Shangri La and Port City were among the examples cited.
Over in India, the Hambantota Port issue did not gain much traction in the media and in political circles, in the backdrop of Sri Lanka’s assurances on the strictly commercial nature of the Joint Venture port. India Today analyst Prabhash Dutta wrote: “Any change in the status quo in the Indian Ocean is bound to alter the security concern for India. In 2014, when China docked its submarines at Hambantota, India raised the issue with Sri Lanka.
The constant talks between Sri Lanka and India at various levels have helped the two countries understand one another's concerns. In May this year, when China wanted to dock its submarine once again at Hambantota port, Sri Lanka turned down the request. With Sri Lanka and India staying on the same page on the issue of security, there is not much for New Delhi to worry about.”
Basil Rajapaksa was not the only one thinking of regime change, though he was careful to add the words “one day when we come to power”. The Joint Opposition’s Prasanna Ranatunga, however, threw caution to the winds when he said “Mahinda Rajapaksa will be in power in December this year” addressing a gathering in his constituency.
Mahinda Rajapaksa himself did not involve himself in this debate. Ranatunga did not elaborate on exactly how Mahinda Rajapaksa could come to power so soon since the present Government can legally go on till 2020. While Government Ministers laughed these threats off, it fell to President Maithripala Sirisena to firmly dash these hopes with an elaborate explanation.
Commenting on a statement by an Opposition Member of Parliament as well as a former minister who said the power of the Government and the Presidency will be over after winning the support of 113 members of Parliament, the President pointed out that according to the Constitution nobody can form a new Government without his blessings. Addressing a meeting in Hingurakgoda, he said when the Government is working for the country’s progress by removing all barriers, certain empty voices were attempting to cause disturbances. “Some people raise their empty voices as they cannot bear the advances made by the Government through protecting democracy and freedom of expression, by changing the way the country was earlier governed through fraud, corruption, waste and family rule, under me as a leader who was raised in the village,” he said.
Prime Minister's call
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who recently completed 40 years as a Parliamentarian, too expressed his views on this issue at a public gathering. The allies of the national unity government should concentrate on the country's development instead of turning on one another, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said. “There is no point in confrontational politics at the moment as what is needed at present is for everyone to focus on development,” he added.
The Opposition, which was searching for an issue to challenge the Government after SAITM, has found it in the issue surrounding Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake whose name was mentioned in relation to a housing deal by one of the witnesses who gave evidence before the Presidential Commission investigating the bond scam. The former Finance Minister, who maintained that he could not appear before the Commission due to other pressing matters, is set to appear before the Commission this week to give his side of the story. The Opposition is already talking about bringing a no –confidence motion against Minister Karunanayake.
While some SLFP Ministers have indicated willingness to vote for such a motion, most UNP Ministers said they would wait till the Minister gives evidence before forming an opinion.
The Joint Opposition and several SLFP Ministers including Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara have called for Minister Karunanayake to step down from his current position either temporarily (until investigations are completed) or permanently.
Minister Kabir Hashim has said the UNP has no issue going it alone, but it would like to continue the cohabitation with the SLFP at least until the Government’s term ends for the sake of developing the country and resolving national issues.
Deft handling of the CPC strike
Amidst these developments, the Government is enjoying a surge in popularity following its deft handling of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) workers’ strike. One web comment stood out in particular: “today is the day that the National Unity Government was really born”. Almost all the persons interviewed by TV stations praised the Government for bringing the Army in to control the situation. While the Opposition raised allegations that certain Government politicians unleashed other methods to quell the protest, the final result pleased the public who had to endure long lines at filling stations to purchase fuel. At least one minister who is known for making very frank comments and who has spent some time in jail precisely because of that trait, told a television interviewer that he was “extremely happy” about how the strike was solved.
The Army handled the matter very professionally, the Government’s declaration of petroleum distribution as an essential service and the order to consider “vacation of post” for those who do not report to work ensured a quick end to the strike. The President held a second round of talks with the CPC unions yesterday (except the JSS which did not participate in the strike) after which the unions said they would not resort to strike action.
This is a victory for the Government. However, there are persistent rumours and threats on a general strike, mainly on SAITM and Hambantota issues, but unions may have taken a backseat at least for the moment with the Government’s competent handling of the CPC strike. An organisation called the SAITM Virodi Jana Pawra (SVJP) has declared August 2 as the National Protest Day Against SAITM), saying protests and black band campaigns will be held across the island. The Railway Engine Drivers' Union also announced that they would launch an indefinite strike from last night over several demands including the operation of Chinese power sets having problems with their brake system. This appears to be a non-politically motivated strike over purely technical and administrative issues.
Jaffna pandemonium
The Government has also taken a serious view of the incidents in Jaffna, the latest being the attack on two policemen (One Sinhalese, one Tamil) by sword and club wielding thugs in Kopay. This comes hot on the heels of the shooting incident involving a Jaffna High Court Judge, who escaped unhurt.
The thugs who attacked the policemen are believed to be members of the Ava gang and former LTTE members. The Police have since arrested several suspects and IGP Pujith Jayasundera visited Jaffna the very next day after the incident to personally direct the ongoing probes.
This incident, coupled with the discovery of a cache of unserviceable weapons from an unused well in Karainagar, has prompted the authorities to tighten security in the peninsula even as they completed the handing over of more military-occupied lands back to civilians. Five suspects have also been arrested by the Police in Jaffna for several offences including the assault of a group of Coast Guards and damaging a police checkpoint at Point Pedro. The authorities have taken care not to involve the military in these investigations, to avoid any complications. Peace is of paramount importance for the people of the Northern Province, which suffered for three long decades as a result of the conflict and the Government must ensure that militancy in whatever form does not rise again in the North.
The Government has to contend with one other major issue in the North and several other provinces – the prolonged drought which has affected more than one million people. The Northern Province is the most affected Province with a total of 462, 815 individuals belonging to 133, 678 families being hit by the drought. Anuradhapura received welcome rains after a long spell of drought over the weekend. Rains are predicted for several of the 17 drought-hit districts over the next few days. The President has instructed officials to provide drought relief packs to the affected families islandwide. In the light of climatic shifts of this nature, the Government must be firmly committed to global instruments designed to mitigate the effects of climate change. With the UK decoding to ban petrol and diesel cars by 2040, it is time for our leaders to think 20-30 years into the future on all fronts without allowing petty politics to spoil it. This is why it is important to go forward with consensual politics to firmly resolve the outstanding issues facing the Nation.
