Kandy unrest
Concessionary loans for destroyed  buisnesses increased

Concessionary loans provided to destroyed businesses during the unrest in Kandy early this year, had been increased.
On March 20, 2018, Cabinet approval had been granted to roll out the ‘Athwela Loan Scheme’ with a maximum loan amount of Rs.500,000 being granted under the scheme.
Public Enterprise and Kandy City Development Minister Lakshman Kiriella, submitting a Cabinet paper this week, however had noted that the above loan was not sufficient to cover the damages of many businesses and that the maximum loan amount be increased.
Accordingly, Cabinet approved Kiriella’s proposal to increase the maximum amount of loans up to Rs. 1 million with a two percent concessionary interest rate for businesses.
