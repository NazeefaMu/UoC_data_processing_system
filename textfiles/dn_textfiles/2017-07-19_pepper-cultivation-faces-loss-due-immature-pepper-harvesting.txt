Pepper cultivation faces loss due to immature pepper harvesting

The Export Agriculture Department has shown its grave concern over the pepper cultivation in the country. Export Agriculture Department Director General Dr. M. A. P. K. Seneviratne told the Daily News that a great loss of pepper harvest was being observed mainly due to the harvesting of immature pepper on large scale. He said, if the pepper pods get crushed or squashed when pressed hard with fingertips, such peppers are considered immature and not suitable to be plucked. Traders buy this immature pepper in bulk at cheap prices and sell them, mixed with half-ripe pepper and gaining exorbitant profits, Seneviratne added.
"This episode has resulted in the deprivation of 40 percent of the real pepper harvest in the country. It is reported that harvesting of immature pepper is practiced in many pepper-growing districts. This wrong harvesting practice shall be discouraged and we are on vigilance. During the first four months of 2017 alone, we have exported 1,242 MT pepper and earned a foreign exchange valued at 1,674.5 million," he said.
He said that the department has sought the assistance at all government agencies, Divisional Secretaries, Grama Niladharis and other field officers, to educate the pepper cultivators about the proper harvesting procedures and their benefits.
