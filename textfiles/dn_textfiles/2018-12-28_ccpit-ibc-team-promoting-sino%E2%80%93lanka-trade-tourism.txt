CCPIT, IBC team up for promoting  Sino–Lanka trade, tourism

The China Council for the Promotion of International Trade of Beijing and the International Business Council of Sri Lanka (IBCSL) have teamed up to promote imports/ exports and tourism between the two countries through a strategy of online marketing which would be absolutely free.
“This would be a huge boon for Sri Lankan exporters and importers as well as tourism companies to access Chinese companies, which will be the home to a billion plus market,” President of IBCSL, Kosala Wickramanayake said.
He said that there would be limitless opportunities to Sri Lankan exporters of black tea, apparel, gems and jewellery, spice and spice related products among a host of others. “There will be also limitless opportunities for importing Chinese products which should be cost competitive as well.”
He also stressed that there would be further opportunities for promoting Chinese tourists into Sri Lanka given that there were 130 million Chinese tourists who were outbound in 2017, reporting a 7% increase year on year and that they had spent US $ 115 billion, which was a 5% increase over the previous year.
The release further said “The China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT) Beijing Sub-Council has created eShow Global, a free online trade show/expo and marketing platform for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) to exhibit their products and services.
It also has a section for cities to promote local business and tourism destinations to the world.
The online platform (www.eshowglobal.com) is free of charge for enterprises and cities to post their products and services.
The free and automatic switching among 50 languages in the system can eliminate language barriers and covers over 80% of the countries in the world.
With its long-term cooperation and collaboration with over 400 global news media, eShow Global will help SMEs achieve global visibility, recognition and influence.
As an important supplement to physical exhibitions, CCPIT Beijing hopes that the online platform will help address the challenges of cross-border trade faced by SMEs caused by cultural differences among various countries, regions and peoples.
There are plans to host a series of special online shows/expo such as “Global Industry Expo”, “Theme Expo”, “Regional Expo” and “City Expo”.
