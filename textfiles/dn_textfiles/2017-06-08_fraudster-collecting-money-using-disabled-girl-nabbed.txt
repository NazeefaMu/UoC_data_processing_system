Fraudster collecting money using disabled girl nabbed

A fraudster who had been collecting money from bus commuters in aid of a disabled girl, claiming her to be his sister, was arrested by Anuradhapura Police.
He was confronted by the mother of the girl concerned on June 4 afternoon when he was selling tickets forged with her address.
Police said investigations revealed that the suspect was a ganja addict, a resident in village No 7, in Weheragala, Tambuttegama who earned a living by hawking 'wade'. He had forged the address of a 19-year-old disabled girl, a resident in Nikaketikanda, Nittabuwa, to sell Rs. 50 tickets to passengers in a bus on the Tambuttegama - Anuradhapura road.
The suspect had offered a ticket to the mother of the girl who was also commuting on the bus and the mother who was taken aback by the episode had informed the bus driver and conductor about the fraudster. The bus crew had accosted the suspect and handed him over to the two officers on duty at the Anuradhapura bus stand who arrested him.
Investigations are continuing.
