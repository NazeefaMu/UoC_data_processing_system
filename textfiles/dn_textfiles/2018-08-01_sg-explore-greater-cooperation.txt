SG to explore greater cooperation

Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland will arrive in Sri Lanka today for a four-day official visit.
This will be her first visit to the country since she assumed the Office of Secretary-General in April 2016.
Today, the Secretary-General will call on Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and meet Foreign Affairs Minister Tilak Marapana. Her meetings on August 2 and 3 will include the Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama, Provincial Councils, Local Government and Sports, Minister Faiszer Musthapha, Youth Affairs, Project Management and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayake, Public Administration and Management and Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam and Leader of the Opposition R. Sampanthan.
The objective of the Secretary-General’s meetings will be to explore greater cooperation and collaboration in the implementation of the agreed outcomes at the 2018 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in London, including promoting intra-Commonwealth trade. Discussions will also include the implementation of the Commonwealth Blue Charter, under which Sri Lanka holds the role of a champion country to lead the Commonwealth effort towards the restoration of mangroves.
