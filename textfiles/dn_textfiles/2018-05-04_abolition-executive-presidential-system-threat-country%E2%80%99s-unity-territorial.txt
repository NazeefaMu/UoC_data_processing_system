Abolition of Executive Presidential system, threat to country’s unity, territorial integrity: Mahasangha

The Mahasangha firmly believed that the Executive Presidential system should be preserved in this country sans any change or dilution. Abolition of the Executive Presidential system would pose a threat to the country’s unity and territorial integrity.
This should engage the firm attention of the Government, Asgiri Parivenadhipati and Deputy Lekakhadhikari of the Asgiriya Chapter Ven. Narampanawe Ananda thera said.
He expressed these sentiments when the 16 SLFP members who resigned from the Government and Ministry portfolios, called on the members of the Karaka Sangha Sabha of the Asgiriya Chapter headed by the Asigiriya Prelate, to educate them on their stance and receive their blessings on May 2.
Ven. Ananda thera said earlier too the Mahasangha opposed the 13th Amendment to the Constitutions because it fathomed the dangers it would pose in future before hand.
But former President J. R. Jayewardene was forced to proceed with it according to circumstances which prevailed in the country. However, former President Jayewardene had the foresight to ensure that the Executive Presidency was preserved for posterity.
It was the powers vested in the Executive Presidency which thwarted attempts made by Vardarajah Perumal to declare a separate state.
Most Ven. Warakagoda Gnanaratana Mahanayake thera, most Ven. Wendaruwe Upali thera and Lekakhadhikari Ven. Medagama Dhammananda thera also spoke.
