Organising an Order

Anujanami Bhikkave Vassane Vassan Udaganja - I advise oh monks! To observe the rainy retreat during the Rainy Season, under one roof.
Just 21 days after the parinibbana of Buddha, Arahant Maha Kassapa decided that a great council must be held with the commencement of the rains retreat for the Sangha. It was held three months after the demise of the Buddha, at Sattapanni Rock Cave in Rajagaha, under the patronage of King Ajasattu.
The attitude of Bhikkhu Subhadda who believed that the Buddha had been curtailing their freedom prompted Elder Maha Kassapa Maha Thera to call for it. Subaddha, who became a monk in his old age advised the mourning monks to celebrate the Parinibbana of the Buddha. Celebrate brothers, said Subaddha. He asked them not to weep, but, be happy that now they can do what they want. “The Master is no more; we are now free.”
Beginnings
All matters concerning organising, planning and conducting was done under the supervision of Elder Maha Kassapa Maha Thera. The council was attended by 499 Arahant Theras at the beginning and Venerable Mahakassapa Thera kept the 500th seat vacant for Venerable Ananda Thera, who attained Arahathship on this Nikini poya day. The great Theravada Buddhist tradition flourishing today in countries such as Sri Lanka, Thailand, Burma, Laos and Cambodia has its beginnings in the first Council.
Arahant Maha Kassapa Thera sent a message to all the participants, that they should assemble in the hall constructed in front of Sapta Parni cave. In the morning Arahants took their seats according to seniority, in the gaily decorated hall. Arahant Upali, chief among the Vinaya experts, took a seat especially arranged in the centre and in reply to Maha Kassapa, he collated the Disciplinary code (Vinaya Pitaka)
Next, Arahant Ananda Thera took that special seat. As questioned and guided by Arahant Maha Kassapa Thera, he collated the entire code of Dhamma covering all five Nikayas. It was well known that all of those five hundred Arahant were experts on Dhamma and Vinaya.
Memorising
Having come to the end of first Sangayana (Council), Elder Maha Kassapa entrusted the responsibility of preserving through memorizing and passing down to posterity, all the books of entire code of discipline to the chief of Discipline, Arahant Upali Mahathera, and his retinue of pupils. Similarly, the responsibility of memorizing and preserving, and passing down to posterity all of the thirty-four long discourses grouped as Digha Nikaya to Arahant Ananda Thera and his retinue of pupils. The Middle Length Discourses (Majjima Nikaya) to Elder Sariputta Thera and his pupils. The Samyuktha Nikaya, to himself and his pupils, while the Anguttra Nikaya to Arahant Anuruddha Thera and his pupils.
The Buddha’s appeal to Maha Kassapa Thera:
“Dear Kassapa, please advise these Bhikkhus and guide them from faltering in their code of conduct. You must please counsel them regularly, now. Preach them the Dhamma too. Or else, I myself will have to do so”.
“O Lord, these Bhikkhus are now highly undisciplined. They are not amenable to correction. They often resort to their own ways. They do not show obedience or patience. They are not willing to abide by advice given to them for their own welfare and progress; instead, they often misconstrue and misunderstand it.”
Opportunity
Arahant Maha Kassapa Thera possessed a variety of very special qualities and attributes, accumulated through a long period in samsara. He preferred to spend most of his days in meditation, maintaining silence for the greater part of the time. He preferred to be ‘an example’ rather than ‘advising’ others.
He spent his old age in the Jetawana Monastery at the request of the Buddha, though he wished to be in ‘forest dwelling, a solitary life, away from society, depending on Pindapatha alone.
Maha Kassapa Thera considered it his responsibility and duty to safeguard the Buddha-Dhamma and the traditions of Bhikkhu life. Elder Kassapa can be regarded as the Deputy to the Buddha himself because it was he who placed the entire teaching well established for the world over through the first council which he conducted.
The commencement of Prathama Dhamma Sangayana[First Council], held after the passing away of the Buddha and Pasuvas or second opportunity for the monks who missed the commencement of rainy retreat on Esala poya were the important happenings on Nikini Poya.
The day is significant for many other reasons as well; other main events of Nikini full moon are, attaining Arahantship by Ananda Maha Thera, the Buddha’s chief attendant and the world famous Kandy Esala Perahera that ends on this day making it more significant for Sri Lankans. Also, the laying of foundation stone for famous Seruwila Dagoba took place on a Nikini Full Moon.
