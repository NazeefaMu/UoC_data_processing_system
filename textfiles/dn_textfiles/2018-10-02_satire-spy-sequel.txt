Satire spy sequel

If you enjoyed 2003’s ‘Johnny English’ and 2011’s ‘Johnny English Reborn’ then the third installment in the series ‘Johnny English Strikes Again’ will be a treat for you. Rowan Atkinson of ‘Mr Bean’ fame brings on a lot of laugher and an engaging plot in his latest adventure.
Accompanied by his trusty sidekick Bough, Atkinson goes on a hunt to find a high-tech villain who has obtained a full list of intelligence’s undercover spies, leaving the MI7 with no option but to turn to the retirees. Thus English is yanked out of retirement where he plays the role of a teacher to a pack of children who are eager for adventure.
The biggest plus point in the film is that it is sans the stereotype comic gags. There are no slapstick comedy but scenes and lines which involve out of the box comedy. Though there is nothing unique in the plot Atkinson manages to keep the audience glued to their seats because of his magnetic acting skills.
Most of the action scenes in the film remind us of other detective and action related films like the ‘Mission Impossible’ series and ‘Skyfall’. Another sector in which the film has failed is in its villain. ‘Rampage’s Jake Lacy makes the unlikeliest of villains and it is clear that he has been roped in to give the villain a comic appeal rather than make it a serious production. Many more scenes like the one in which the spy duo burn down an outdoor diner while trying to get information from a phone is aimed at making the audience roll in their seats with laughter.
The heroine pf the film, Olga Kurylenko who plays Ophelia’s character, does not have much screen time but manages to make a significant mark in the plot. Ben Miller too is overshadowed by Atkinson but still earns a few laughs by playing his part well.
The pace is brisk, the jokes make up for in quantity what they lack in quality and the film never resorts to sleaze or meanness to earn its laughs. So knock yourself out when you hit the theaters as everyone’s favourite dedicative gets back in action.
