Stronger mechanisms needed to safeguard differently abled  persons’ rights

 
The differently abled persons requested that a stronger mechanisms to coordinate and monitor their rights is vital, and they rejected the initiatives to entrust their issues to one ministry.
Convener to the February 8 Movement Cyril Sirwardane said one ministry cannot be held accountable to ensure the rights of the differently abled persons.
“Wed need a powerful institution than a ministry. It would be great if the government can establish a separate body, functioning under the President’s direct purview, the Prime Minister’s or Cabinet’s who would also be the convener,” he said addressing the media at the International Centre for Ethnic Studies (ICES).
At present, the Social Service Department under the Social Empowerment and Welfare Ministry is committed to create an independent lifestyle for differently abled and vision impaired persons.
Ashoka Bandula, one of the movement’s conveners, said the existing National Council for Persons with Disabilities (NCPD) has been a failure. He said the reason could be that its composition, functions and powers are controlled by a single ministry.
The members of the February 8 Movement urged that their rights are beyond welfare. They pointed out that the Social Services Ministry does not have the capacity to coordinate and guide other ministries to safeguard the rights of the persons with disabilities.
They also highlighted that effective inter-ministerial coordination is vital to ensure that persons with disabilities have equal opportunity without any barriers.
“It has been nearly two decades since the Act for protection of the rights of persons with disabilities was passed, but nothing has been done effectively to ensure our rights,” said Bandula.
Rasanjali Pathirage of the Sri Lanka Foundation of the Rehabilitation of the Disabled said differently abled women also face extreme discrimination.
“The NCPD has never ensured the rights of the women with disabilities. It never made an attempt to include differently abled women as a part of the programmes initiated by the Women and Children Affairs Ministry,” she claimed.
