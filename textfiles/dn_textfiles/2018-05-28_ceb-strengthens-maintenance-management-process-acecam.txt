CEB strengthens Maintenance Management Process with ACECAM

Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) is the leading state owned organization in using Computerized Maintenance Management Solution (CMMS) for utility management in Sri Lanka with its solution partner Acecam (Pvt) Ltd.
CEB continues the journey of improving their entire maintenance management process by implementing “TOMMS” which is a computerized maintenance management software (CMMS) for its critical asset management in a staggered approach based on the asset concentration.
Transmission division, holder of over 60 grid stations, high tension electric lines etc. spread across the country commenced automating the maintenance management process in grand scale with a project kick-off meeting on April 3, 2018 at Moven-pick hotel with the participation of senior officials of CEB and its solution provider Acecam (Pvt).
According to a senior officer of Transmission Asset Maintenance Division, “gone are the days of using traditional methods to keep track of our maintenance program. Hereafter we are planning to store a wealth of information about each asset, including information about warranties, manufacturers, catalogs, vendor details and expenses in a single software which provides us a high traceability and minimize probable human errors in practicing asset maintenance routines.”
Addressing the gathering another senior officer of Transmission Division said that “after implementing TOMMS CMMS, our team can make correct decisions on assets and its maintenance aspects being on-site or off-site through seamless access to the asset related information via the web. We want to make informed decisions on our assets quickly to minimize unnecessary expenses, delays in the processes and improve service quality.”
According to Ruwan Manchanayake, Director at Acecam, TOMMS CMMS is an excellent tool useful for the companies that are extremely dependent on the operational state of their equipment, especially in the fields of Manufacturing, Power and Energy, Marine and Offshore, Construction, Transportation ans Highways, Irrigation and Water Management, Hospital and Healthcare, Hotel and Leisure Management, Facility Management etc. TOMMS CMMS makes it possible for both the operational and strategic level staff of CEB to collaborate in defining, controlling and managing maintenance tasks pertaining to their assets.
