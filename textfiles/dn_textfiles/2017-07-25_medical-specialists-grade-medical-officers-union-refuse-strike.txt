Medical Specialists, Grade Medical Officers Union refuse to strike

 
Two medical officers' associations - the Association of Medical Specialists (AMS) and Grade Medical Officers Union (GMOU) - will not participate in the ongoing islandwide token strike lauched by the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA), Government sources said.  
The GMOA launched a strike at 8 a.m. today alleging the government had failed to meet eight demands which include appointing an ‘acceptable’ Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) President, gazetting the minimum standards on medical education and to discontinuing the recruitment of students to the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM).
