Minister accuses doctors of poster campaigning

Health Minister Dr.Rajitha Senaratne accused the doctors of poster campaigning.
He said that Professor Colvin Gunaratne resigned from his post as he was unable to make necessary amendments to the SLMA Act and insisted that it needs amendments.
“The role of the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) is to safeguard the lives and rights of the people and not always focus on their petty motives,” he said. The Minister alleged that the mistakes nade by doctors are concealed and not allowed to be prosecuted and added that GMOA never takes proper disciplinary action against the doctors found guilty.
“In foreign countries, the Medical Council is comprised of persons from different fields. It is only here that some people are holding up to it and not letting any proper initiative to be taken. There are no Medical Council elections like in our country. Many aspects have to be improved,” he said. The Minister questioned that when was the last time that this association took action against a doctor who committed a medical mistake. He further said that public do not make complaints to the association anymore as they have lost faith.
