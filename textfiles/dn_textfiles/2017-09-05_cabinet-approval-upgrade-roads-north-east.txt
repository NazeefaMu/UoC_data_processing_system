Cabinet approval to upgrade roads in North, East

The Cabinet of Ministers granted approval for the rehabilitation and upgrading of 66 roads in the conflict affected Northern and Eastern Provinces based on a Cabinet Memorandum submitted by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. This was a long-felt need of the Northern and Eastern Provinces which were affected by conflict over a period of 30 years.
Unreliable and inadequate road infrastructure is a major impediment for the economic growth in these two Provinces. To create a conducive environment for private sector investments, it is important to consider the road improvements as a high priority strategic investment. This would promote and expand export of agricultural, fisheries and livestock products etc. and enable the regions to make a bigger contribution to the country's GDP.
Under phase one, it is planned to develop and upgrade approximately 2,500 Km of RDA, RDD, and rural roads at a cost of over US $ 200 million, as part of national integration and reconciliation efforts in the Northern and Eastern Provinces to bring a strong bridge between North and the South to enhance unity, harmony, coexistence and to build sustainable peace among communities and ensure economic growth and poverty reduction said V. Sivagnanasothy, Secretary, Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation.
Under this project in the Jaffna District roads such as Valukkaiyaru Punguduththivu - Kurikadduwan Road, Jaffna Manipai- Karainagar Road and Punnalai - Point Pedro Road, Eluthumadduwal – Nagarkovil Road including many Road Development Authority (RDA), (Road Development Department) RDD and rural roads, Nainathivu and Kurikadduwan Jetties are to be rehabilitated.
In the Kilinochchi District roads such as Murikandi Kanagapuram Paranthan Road and in the Mullaitivu District the bridge across Kokkilai lagoon, Vadduvaikal bridge, and Vattapalai main road and in the Mannar District, Mahilankulam Pallamadhu Road, Peramanalankulam Road, and Periyapandivirichan Road – Mullikulam Road and in the Batticaloa Kiran bridge, Santhiveli Thikiliveddai bridge and Marine Drive Batticaloa – Kalkuda Road will be rehabilitated and upgraded.
Further, Trincomalee and Ampara Districts has also been included and many rural and RDD roads in the Northern and Eastern Districts are to be covered under this initiative.
The project is to be executed by the Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation with other relevant line Ministries and agencies including the Road Development Authority (RDA). The project was formulated under the guidance of the Prime Minister’s Northern and Eastern Provinces Development Committee and recommended by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Management headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and got the endorsement of the Cabinet of Ministers.
The Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation directly comes under the purview of President Maithripala Sirisena and these road interventions will be executed under the President’s guidance. Action is being taken to call for tenders with financing arrangements on soft terms said Sivagnanasothy, Secretary, Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation.
