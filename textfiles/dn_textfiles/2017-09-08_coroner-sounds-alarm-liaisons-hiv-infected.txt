Coroner sounds alarm on liaisons of HIV infected

Stresses need to keep track of close affiliates
Colombo City Coroner, Iresha Samaraweera yesterday called for a mechanism to monitor relations of persons affected with AIDS in order to prevent the spread of the disease.
She said the presence of an institution to carry out this task will be of great use to the country at large.Samaraweera made these observations at the Colombo City Coroner’s Court during an inquest into the death of a woman who had suffered from HIV.
The woman, a Filipino national has been subjected to a post mortem without a blood test being carried out and thus her medical reports stated the cause of death to be a cold which turned into pneumonia.
The Coroner however pointed out that the bed head reports from two of Colombo’s Hospitals, showed that she was a serious HIV patient.
AIDS is a disease which weakens one’s immune system, and even a common cold can turn into pneumonia, explained the Coroner.
The Filipino national had worked as a technician in a famous garment factory for the past eight years and it is reported that she had relations with several locals during that time. Submissions made to Court also revealed that the woman was living together with a married man at the time of her death and thus the Coroner stressed that it was more important than ever to have a system to record the family background and details of partners of her partner and his partners. She added that this was not the first case she had worked on where HIV patients had posed the risk of infection to others.
Special attention needs to be paid to such families but we don’t have such an institution to take on that responsibility, she said.
The deceased identified as Lilian Berdios Arasalima (44) has had no family living here and the Human Resource Director of the company informed court that they have informed her family in the Philippines of her death and they have made arrangements to send her body back to her home country.
