CSE branch-wide educational drive gathers momentum

The branch-wide investor education campaign conducted by the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) has been well received over the first half of the year, with over 350educational and awareness initiatives conducted in 2017.
The initiatives have reached out to over 14,300 current and prospective investors around the country.
Initiatives driven through the CSE branch network play a significant role in facilitating the CSE’s investor education and awareness drive, which reaches out to a broad range of socio-economic and demographic segments.
A range of events including regional investor forums, educational workshops, seminars on market conditions, programmes for schools and universities and other awareness programmes deliver stock market and financial literacy focused content in English, Sinhala and Tamil mediums.
A vast majority of these initiatives are conducted free-of-charge and feature experienced stock market practitioners as resource personnel. Commenting on the initiative, the Head of Market Development at CSE, Niroshan Wijesundere said, “Broadening the retail investor segment and attracting knowledgeable and long term investors is vital to increasing market liquidity and to the sustainable growth of the stock market. These initiatives offer the platform to achieve this and aim to offer prospective investors the awareness and perspective they require prior to entering the market as an investor.”
The educational and awareness programs are delivered through CSE Branches in Matara, Kandy, Kurunegala, Negombo, Jaffna, Anuradhapura, Ratnapura, Ambalantota and the Head Office in Colombo.
Details of educational and awareness events are announced through the CSE website (www.cse.lk) and on official social media pages of the CSE.
