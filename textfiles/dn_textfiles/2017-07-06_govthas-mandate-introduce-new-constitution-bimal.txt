Govt.has mandate to introduce new Constitution: Bimal

The present government has a mandate given by 6.2 million people in 2015 to bring in a new Constitution, JVP MP Bimal Ratnayake yesterday said.
Ratnayake further said the Chief Prelates’ position regarding a new Constitution is the opinion of the venerable monks. He also said all the previous governments came into power promising a new Constitution but failed to realise it.
MP Ratnayake was speaking at a press briefing at the JVP Head office. Ratnayaka pointed out the government has a duty to inform the Chief Prelates about the situation.
MP Ratnayake further said the government is responsible to raise awareness regarding the new Constitution without allowing extremists to mislead the public.
