‘Tagore auditorium designed by SEC’

The State Engineering Corporation, in a letter to the Daily News, yesterday clarified that the Rabindranath Tagore Memorial Auditorium built using an Indian grant was designed by architects and engineers of the SEC and not by Geoffrey Bawa.
In the article published on the topic on October 10, it was mentioned that the building was designed by Geoffrey Bawa. The Daily News would like to highlight that the error was a result of a typographical mistake in the press release sent to the paper by the Indian High Commission.
The Indian High Commission too has clarified that the building was designed to conform to the design principles of Geoffrey Bawa and all credit should go to the SEC for it.
