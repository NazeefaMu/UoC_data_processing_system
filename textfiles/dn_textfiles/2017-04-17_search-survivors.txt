In search of survivors

Rescue operations are underway while the death toll continues to rise in the Meetotamulla garbage dump disaster. The garbage dump, about 90-metre high, collapsed after flames engulfed it on Friday. According to relief workers, over 100 houses may have been buried. Here are some snapshots of the relief operations. Pictures by Sulochana Gamage
