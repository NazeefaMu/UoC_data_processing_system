Ministry to investigate moon-sighting quandary

Muslim Religious Affairs and Postal Services Minister M. H. A. Haleem yesterday said the ministry would conduct an investigation into the confusion over the moon-sighting for the Ramazan festival this year.
The Moon-Sighting Committee, which consists of representatives from the All-Ceylon Jamaithul Ulemma and the Colombo Grand Mosque, are entrusted with the duty to declare the start and end of the Ramazan period every year. Ramazan is the ninth month of the lunar (Islamic) calendar and begins when the new moon is sighted. It ends after 29 to 30 days, with the sighting once again of the new moon.
This year, while Muslims around the world began their fast on May 17, the Moon-Sighting Committee in Sri Lanka declared that the moon had not been sighted locally and that the Muslims in the island would start their fast on May 18.
On June 14, a day before the calendar date for the festival of Eid-ul-Fitr, however, confusion reigned as many had reported to have seen the crescent moon, but the Moon-Sighting Committee had refused to declare the next day to be the festival. This confusion meant that certain devotees would have celebrated on Friday (15), while others celebrated on Saturday (16).
“I will be summoning the current Moon-Sighting Committee to investigate what had happened and thereafter, we will look into whether we need a new committee, ” the minister said.
He added that they would look into the possibility of adding other members, including scientists and professionals into the committee, to make it more representative of the community. In the meantime, petitions had been submitted to the minister requesting that he resolve the issue by forming a better-informed committee to sight the moon every year, in order to clear up any future confusions.
