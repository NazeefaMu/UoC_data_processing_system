Vouchers for free school uniform materials

Kurunegala District UNP Parliamentarian and Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said that all school students countrywide would be issued with vouchers for free uniform materials for next year, on or before December 2, this year.
The printing of these vouchers is now in progress and a team of high-ranking officials has been appointed to supervise this process as it has to be implemented countrywide without any lapses.
During next two weeks, all school heads countrywide would be explained and instructed in detail as to how this programme has to be implemented properly, without being of any inconvenience to both students and parents, Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam told the Daily News, speaking to the media in Kuliyapitiya, Kurunegala.
He also revealed that about 15,000 school teachers would be recruited shortly for the service of remote schools countrywide and 9,000 school teachers who have already served in the same national school for over ten years continuously too, would be given transfers early next year.
At present, there are about 354 national schools countrywide, he further added.
