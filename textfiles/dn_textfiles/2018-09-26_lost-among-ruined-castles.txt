LOST AMONG  RUINED CASTLES

I know that curiosity killed the cat but not the Welsh cat. Being curious is one thing; being investigative is another. Both activate the mind not forgetting the same applies to many species of the animal community, especially the street dog who has the natural instinct for it. They all have sharp minds.
Why do I say so?
Because of my curiosity to explore the castles in Wales. The more I visit, the more they activate my mind.
There is so much of story, more mystery and history to dwell into which the Welsh give little significance.
They care less to visit apart from organized tours for ancient history. Yet, over the centuries they stand spectacular monuments to Welsh history and civilization. It is a must for anyone with a feel for history mainly for their architectural splendour. If I am to identify few among the massive ones strewn around, it will be the castle of Conway, Beaumaris, Cennen, Caerphilly, Pembroke etc.
Tudor Mansion
One castle that swept me off my feet was Laugharne, where history reveals to be an old one, fought for in the 12th and 13th centuries and presently incorporated into a Tudor Mansion and cited in Carmarthenshire 9 miles south-west of Carmarthen. This was repeatedly taken over by the Welsh.
Laugharne Castle has a history of constantly changing possession.
It was repeatedly taken by the Welsh and wrecked but many a time won back by the Normans. It was still changing hands in the second half of the 13th century and the first established ownership was that of Sir John Perrot during the reign of Henry VIII.
The medieval remains consist mainly of an early round keep and a round tower which was probably built around 13th century. The ruins of the gatehouse are also well preserved and date from soon after the tower.
It is a fascination to walk through this massive structure and get the feeling one is thrown back a couple of centuries to the past. There is movement inside as the wind passes through every possible passage creak even through laid bricks, take a turn to come back again. This keeps happening non-stop until dark when the wind or breeze relax and the trees around droop in sleep.
Yet, its original form is uncertain as the old castle was incorporated into construction as a mansion of some buildings by Sir John Perrot.
This castle with many had been so violently awakened after the inactivity of the 14th century, were repaired, and those lords who clearly saw the war clouds gathering over the houses of York and Lancaster looked to their walls and moats once again.
The Wars of Roses held interest for the great majority of the Welsh only because of a man who ended them, Henry Tudor claimant to the Duchy of Lancaster, born in Pembroke Castle. The Tudors came from Anglesey.
After generations, the Duke of Lancaster claimed the English throne to heal the rifts between York and Lancaster. Meanwhile, the Stuarts maintained the recognition that Wales had enjoyed from the Tudors when the Civil War broke out in 1642.
Wales was firmly Royalist and provided the breeding ground for Puritans and the Parliament.
Civil War
Many a castle explored and appeased my thirst and hundreds left behind the mystery of these castles lay hidden to be discovered (maybe when I visit again) is the end of a discovery in Wales.
It also reminds me of their Civil War and a period in the Tudor dynasty which naturally contended one for the Welsh written all over their castles.
