Miller, du Plessis plunder tons as South Africa win series

HOBART, Sunday: David Miller and Faf du Plessis plundered big-hitting centuries in a batting masterclass as South Africa beat Australia by 40 runs to win their one-day series and inflict another defeat on Justin Langer's misfiring side.
The pair shared in a 252-run stand to power the Proteas to 320-5 in the third and final match in Hobart -- a record fourth wicket partnership by South Africa against the hosts in Australia.
They came together at 55-3 in the 16th over with Miller swatting 139 for his fifth limited-overs century and skipper du Plessis smashing 125 -- his 10th one-day ton.
A composed Shaun Marsh cracked a fighting 106 in the run chase, ably supported by Marcus Stoinis (63) and Alex Carey (42) -- an improvement on recent batting displays but still not good enough. – AFP
