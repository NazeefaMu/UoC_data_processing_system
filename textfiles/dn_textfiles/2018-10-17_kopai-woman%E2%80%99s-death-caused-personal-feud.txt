Kopai woman’s death caused by personal feud

The Police dismissed reports in certain web sites stating that a woman had been killed while trying to save her son from motorcycle gangs in Jaffna, adding that the incident had no connection to the Aava gangs in the North.
Police Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara clarifying the incident said that a clash had occurred between two groups of youths in the Kopai, Uralu area over a personal feud and when the mother of one of the boys had intervened and tried to break up the fight, she was assaulted and had sustained injuries.
She was admitted to the Jaffna Hospital and had later died. However, the postmortem examination conducted on the 53-year-old victim Sandararasa Wijayakumari had revealed that she had died due to a heart attack.
Meanwhile, the Kopai Police had conducted investigations and had arrested three suspects in connection with the attack. They were produced before the Jaffna Magistrate’s Court and were ordered to be remanded till October 25. However, the Police Spokesman said that these three youths were not involved with any group or gang and this incident was based purely on a personal dispute between the two parties.
