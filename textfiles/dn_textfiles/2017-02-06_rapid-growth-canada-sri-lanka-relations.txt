Rapid growth in Canada - Sri Lanka relations

 
Sri Lanka’s High Commissioner to Canada, Ahmed A. Jawad emphasised on the rapid growth in Sri Lanka – Canada relations while addressing the Independence Day celebration.
The event was held in Sri Lanka High Commissioner’s official residence in Canada.
The Commissioner said that the visit of the Foreign Minister of Canada for the first time in 13 years, the formation of the Sri Lanka-Canada Friendship Group in the Canadian Parliament and the initialling of a fully-fledged Code Share Agreement between the two countries, after nearly 14 years since the initial request are reasons for the tie.
High Commissioner Ahmed A Jawad also enumerated important developments in Sri Lanka in the past year.
The High Commissioner expressed his satisfaction over the trajectory of bi-lateral ties and said that he hope to further expand relations in 2017.
Referring to the substantial presence of Canadians of Sri Lankan origin, the High Commissioner referred to them as a vital link between the two countries, by which Canada has been enriched.
He concluded his address stating “A nation is not wrought overnight. It is built brick by brick.  Undoubtedly much has been achieved in the last 69 years. It is a Sri Lanka in which all its citizens endeavour to live in a spirit of unity in diversity that we aspire to build; one in which all Sri Lankans are proud to call themselves Sri Lankan”. 
The Independence Day message of President Maithripala Sirisena was read by Sri Lanka’s High Commissioner to Canada, Ahmed A. Jawad, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe’s and Minister of Foreign Affairs Mangala Samaraweera’s messages were read by Waruna Wilpatha, Minister at the High Commission and Chandrakumar Chellaturai, a Canadian of Sri Lankan descent, respectively.
