White House files appeal against Judge Robart ruling: Trump says ‘we'll win’

The US justice department has filed an appeal against a judge’s order lifting Donald Trump’s controversial travel ban, as the new administration’s flagship immigration policy threatened to unravel after one week.
After the appeal was lodged on Saturday, Trump told reporters at his private Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida: “We’ll win. For the safety of the country, we’ll win.”
Trump’s comments followed a personal attack on US district judge James Robart, the Seattle-based justice who made the court ruling on Friday which questioned the constitutionality of Trump’s order and which was applied nationwide.
“The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!” Trump said on Twitter early on Saturday.
Trump, who has said “extreme vetting” of refugees and immigrants is needed to prevent terrorist attacks, continued to criticise the decision in tweets throughout Saturday.
“The judge opens up our country to potential terrorists and others that do not have our best interests at heart. Bad people are very happy!” he tweeted.
The justice department’s appeal promises to create a showdown between the new administration and the judiciary over a policy that Trump consistently promised to deliver while on the campaign trail.
But the ban’s implementation has also placed under close scrutiny the role of the authors of the travel ban order – Trump’s strategist Steve Bannon and aide Steven Miller – as the administration tries to assert its authority on the Washington bureaucracy.
After a week of chaos at airports across the US since the ban was imposed, the department of homeland security said on Saturday it would return to its normal procedures for screening travellers as it lifted the restrictions in accordance with the court ruling.
Refugees and thousands of travellers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen who had been prevented from travelling since last weekend by Trump’s executive order scrambled to get flights to quickly enter the United States.
Immigration advocacy groups including the American Civil Liberties Union and International Refugee Assistance Project issued a joint statement on Saturday urging those with now valid visas from the seven nations “to consider rebooking travel to the United States immediately” because the ruling could be overturned or put on hold.
The justice department did not say when it would file its appeal with the ninth circuit US court of appeals.
The three-judge panel that will decide whether to immediately block the ruling includes appointees of George W Bush and two former Democratic presidents, Jimmy Carter and Barack Obama.
The travel ban brought protests across the US and the world at the weekend. In America there were demonstrations in New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles among others, and also outside Trump’s Florida resort on Saturday night where he was attending a ball with his wife Melania. There were also protests in London, Paris, Berlin, Jakarta, Manila, Hong Kong, Sydney and Melbourne.
Trump’s attack on Robart also brought an angry response from Democrats. Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader in the House, said: “No matter how many times the president attacks this judge … it won’t change the fact that this ban is unconstitutional, immoral and dangerous.”
Democratic senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont said in a statement on Saturday that Trump’s “hostility toward the rule of law is not just embarrassing, it is dangerous. He seems intent on precipitating a constitutional crisis”.
Criticising the judge’s decision could make it tougher for justice department attorneys as they seek to defend the executive order in Washington state and other courts, said Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University.
Presidents were usually circumspect about commenting on government litigation. “It’s hard for the president to demand that courts respect his inherent authority when he is disrespecting the inherent authority of the judiciary. That certainly tends to poison the well for litigation,” Turley said.
It is unusual for a president to attack a member of the judiciary, which the US constitution designates as a check to the power of the executive branch and Congress. Reached by email on Saturday, Robart declined comment on Trump’s tweets.
“Read the ‘so-called’ Constitution,” tweeted Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee.
In an interview with ABC scheduled to air on Sunday, vice president Mike Pence said he did not think Trump’s criticisms of the judge undermined the separation of powers. “I think the American people are very accustomed to this president speaking his mind and speaking very straight with them,” Pence said, according to an excerpt of the interview.
The court ruling was the first move in what could be months of legal challenges to Trump’s push to clamp down on immigration.
The sudden reversal of the ban catapulted would-be immigrants back to airports, with uncertainty over how long the window to enter the US will remain open.
In Erbil, the capital of the Kurdish region of northern Iraq, Fuad Sharef and his family prepared to fly on Saturday to Istanbul and then New York before starting a new life in Nashville, Tennessee.
“I am very happy that we are going to travel today. Finally, we made it,” said Sharef, who was stopped from boarding a New York-bound flight last week.
