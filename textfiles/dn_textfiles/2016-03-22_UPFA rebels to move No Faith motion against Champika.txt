UPFA rebels to move No Faith motion against Champika

 
If proper action is not taken against Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka regarding the motor accident which occurred at Rajagiriya recently, the Joint Opposition will move a No Confidence motion in Parliament against him, Parliamentarian Bandula Gunawardena said.
Gunawardena said Ranawaka was not a namesake minister but a very responsible minister and a member of the Constitutional Council which appointed
Independent Commissions and as such he should show more impartiality than even those Commissions regarding incidents of this nature.
"As such speeding away in a vehicle after knocking down a person on the high road was a rather irresponsible act which set a bad example to even the Independent Commissions. This was one reason why the Opposition had opposed the appointment of parliamentarians or ministers to the Constitutional Council," the MP said.
Gunawardena said they boy who fell victim to the Rajagiriya road accident was still in a serious condition with loss of speech and since the government did not take suitable action against the minister ignoring circumstantial evidence, the Common Opposition had decided to move the No Confidence motion against the minister.
