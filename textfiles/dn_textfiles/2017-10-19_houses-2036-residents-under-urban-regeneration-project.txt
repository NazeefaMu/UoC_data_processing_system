Houses for 2,036 residents under Urban Regeneration project

Due to Kelani Valley Railway Line Development Projects
The government has decided to provide 2,036 residents who will lose their houses due to the Kelani Valley Railway Line Development Projects, houses under the Urban Regeneration project, launched by the Urban Development Authority (UDA).
Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva received Cabinet approval on Tuesday to ‘obtain funds for reserving 2,036 houses with a value of between Rs.4-5 million from housing projects implemented by the UDA within 2017-2019 under the Urban Regeneration Project’. The Kelani Valley Railway Line Development Project aims to improve the line from Maradana to Padukka as a double track railway line and to rehabilitate the rest up to Avissawela.
The ‘Urban Regeneration Project’ under the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development had proposed to build a five storied condominium apartment complex consisting of 500 apartment units on five acres in the Angoda Hospital premises. The overall goal of the Urban Regeneration Project was to build 70,000 housing units to resettle the low income families.
Houses built by the project in Angoda however, were rejected by the low income families in Colombo as they had refused to move from the heart of Colombo to Angoda.
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Champika Ranawaka thereafter obtained
Cabinet approval to sell these flats to members of the Tri-Forces, lower middle income government servants, artistes, small and medium businessmen and women and civil activists.
The units built at a cost of Rs.3.4 million each was to be sold for between Rs.4-5 million.
