Horton Square Development Project set to redefine Colombo Skyline

The ground breaking ceremony of Horton Square, a St Regis Hotels and Residences branded mega real estate development project, that is set to redefine Colombo’s skyline, marking a watershed moment in Sri Lanka’s development story.
The project, presently “Horton Square” until it is formally named at the launch scheduled in the next six months, will be one of the tallest twin towers in the country, and will house luxurious apartments built and furnished in line with global St Regis standards, prime commercial space, and a luxury St Regis Hotel- the esteemed brand of the Starwood Group.
Located in the elite residential capital of Colombo, Cinnamon Gardens, Horton Square is already being coined as the most prestigious real estate development project that Sri Lanka will have ever seen. World renowned partners including Zhongtian Group as the key construction partner, leading architects Archedium, and many global giants have already taken their stake in this unique project.
“Today’s ground-breaking of Horton Square marks a milestone for Sri Lanka. This is not just another building but a symbol of renewed investor confidence both in the future of Sri Lanka, its growth potential, as well as the aspirations of her people. Sri Lanka is emerging as a ‘high value’ destination both for foreign investment boosting the economy, and for tourists. Horton Square represents the full confidence that we and our partners have in the potential for Sri Lanka and I have no doubt that we will lead the way for international investors to follow suit” said Paul Kelly, Chief Executive Officer of the Horton Square Pte Ltd, the company exclusively set up to manage the project.
The project brings together combined skill sets from a diverse group of stakeholders in the form of significant experience in real estate development, investment and fund raising, technical knowhow as well as established relationships across the global real estate investment and marketing network. Strategic partners from countries including Singapore, China, Japan, USA and the UK are contributing to the project, making it a benchmark for future development projects with majority of buyers of the residential units coming from overseas direct investment.
“In addition to the strength of our combined skill sets, the contribution and professionalism displayed by the Ministry of Megapolis and Urban Development for Sri Lanka tourism for Horton Square has been highly commendable. The ministry’s support, guided by the visionary leadership of Minister Patali Champika Ranawka, has played and will continue to play a key role in restoring foreign investor confidence to commit to Sri Lanka’s future” added Paul Kelly.
