Ayurvedic Dispensary opened at Komari

The newly constructed Central Ayurvedic Dispensary at Komari in the Pottuvil Secretariat Division in the Ampara district funded by the Eastern Province Health Ministry, was opened for the public by Eastern Province Health Minister A.L.M.Nazeer recently.
Provincial Minister Nazeer said the primary needs of the people were ignored by the previous regime. They spent money on unnecessary projects to gain popularity. The good governance government will ensure the rights of all, he said.
Minister Nazeer made these views at the opening ceremony of the Komari Central Ayurvedic Dispensary.
He said they did not give any promise to the people during the election period. But they rendered dedicated service to the people, he said.
Eastern Provincial Councillor M.Rajeswaran, Provincial Ayurvedic Department Director Dr.R.Srithar, Pottuvil Assistant Divisional Secretary M.A.C.ahhamed Nazeel and Health Department officials also participated.
