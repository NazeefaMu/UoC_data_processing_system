GMOA to complain against political interference on SLMC

 
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) will complain to International Medical Councils regarding unacceptable political influences on Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) in connection with the SAITM issue, GMOA Secretary Dr. Navin De Soysa said.
According to Dr. Soysa, the GMOA will make a formal request from them to hold an International inquiry on the various political influences made on SLMC, pressuring it to recognize SAITM and its ‘medical students’.
Both the institution and the students do not have legal recognition and do not have permission to operate.
The GMOA will also make a formal request from all SLMC councilors to step down if politicians do not allow them to function independently, because then the International bodies can question the Sri Lankan Government in connection with this issue and the Government is answerable, he said.
The GMOA will take legal action and stern trade union action to avoid any possible violations of the Medical Ordinance and any interference on the independency of the SLMC, he added.
This so called private medical faculty, its human and other resources, education or anything, had not received the registration from the SLMC or at least have any required minimum standards to function, he stressed.
