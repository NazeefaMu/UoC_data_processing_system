Over 70 percent deaths in SL caused by NCDs - Rajitha

In the world about 70 percent of deaths take place due to Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs) and in Sri Lanka about 75 percent of deaths take place due to NCDs.
A lot of work should be done in order to control and minimize NCDs, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Addressing the gathering during the award presentation for the best performances in Well Woman Clinic Programme (2016) held at Temple Trees yesterday, he said that over 800 Healthy Life Style Centres and over 800 Well Woman Clinics operate countrywide at the moment and the WHO highly praised Sri Lanka's health system. The WHO recognized Sri Lankan health system as a role model for the rest of the countries in the world.
According to Minister Senaratne the world bank especially recognized Sri Lankan health sector as a very successful one and invited Sri Lankan Health Minister for the meeting held in April attended by Finance Minister and Foreign Minister. Previously, no other Health Minister has being invited for this meeting other than the Finance Minister and Foreign Affairs Minister.
The World Bank offered USD 200 million (Rs. 30,000 million) to control NCDs for a period of five years.Controlling NCDs is the main challenge faced by Sri Lankan health sector at the moment.
The whole world is watching the Sri Lankan health sector. Revolutionary decisions were made after January, 2015 in the Sri Lankan health sector in order to ensure the well being of people.
The use of tobacco has been controlled in SL through the biggest tax in the world and tax imposed on sugar has helped discourage the use of excessive sugar.
The prices of drugs have been reduced drastically. Everything has been done on behalf of the country and not to change a government or a political party, he added.
Health Services Director General Dr. Anil Jasinghe said that the primary health care will be developed according to a concept of Minister Senaratne from the end of next year with World Bank assistance. He said that Sri Lanka's screening system for diseases is excellent and that in the past only rich and educated women were concerned about Pap Smear etc. but now it has reached village level.
Health Ministry Secretary Janaka Sugathadasa, Family Health Bureau Director Dr. Priyani Senadhira and many others were present at the occasion.
