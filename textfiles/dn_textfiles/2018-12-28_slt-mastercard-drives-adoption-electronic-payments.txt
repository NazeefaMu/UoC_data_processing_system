Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT), the national ICT solutions provider in Sri Lanka, announced its partnership with global electronic payments major, Mastercard, to drive the adoption of electronic payments in Sri Lanka.
Under this partnership, Mastercard cardholders will receive a cashback reward of Rs.100 on each SLT bill payment of more than Rs. 1,000 made using a Mastercard credit or debit card issued in Sri Lanka, for up to three bill payments within a month. Payments can be made at all SLT Teleshop and authorised collection centres islandwide and online, on www.slt.lk. The cashback reward sum will be credited to the respective SLT account in the following month.
This is applicable to all SLT bill payments made from December 15 to April 30.
“Mastercard is excited to partner with Sri Lanka’s national ICT solutions provider, SLT, as part of our ongoing efforts to drive the adoption of electronic payments in Sri Lanka. Given SLT’s wide customer base across both urban and rural areas, this partnership will allow us to raise awareness on the benefits of electronic payments in all corners of the island. With cash back rewards on offer, we look forward to seeing more individuals and businesses use their Mastercard credit and debit cards for SLT bill payments,” said R. B.

Chairma SLT P.G. Kumarasinghe Sirisena, said, “At SLT, we have always sought to leverage technology to enhance our service quality and deliver greater value and convenience to the nation. Being cognizant of the transformative power of digital payments and the value it brings to the entire system, we are delighted to partner with Mastercard on promoting the adoption of electronic payment instruments. We invite our customers to avail the rewards on offer by making more of their SLT bill payments with their Mastercard credit and debit cards. Going beyond the rewards, we believe that such efforts play a small yet significant role in transforming the country’s cash heavy payments landscape.”
