ETF opens office in  Trincomalee today

A new office of the Employees Trust Fund (ETF) will be opened at No. 455, Kandy Road, Trincomalee, today (5), for the benefit of employees in the Trincomalee and Batticaloa districts.
At present, the only Employees Trust Fund office in the Eastern Province is situated in Ampara and employees in Batticaloa and Trincomalee districts have to travel to Ampara to visit the ETF office.
Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister Ravindra Samaraweera who looked into this problem made arrangements to open an ETF office in Trincomalee to enable employees in the Trincomalee and Batticaloa districts to get their matters attended to without much hassle, a Ministry release said.
The release said this will be the 19th office of the Employees Trust Fund in the island which will offer the same services offered by the Colombo office, including online services. It will also service nearly 400 employers and nearly 7,000 employees in the Batticaloa district as well.
The Employees Trust Fund has nearly 2.6 million active members as against nearly 81,000 employers. ETF funds amount to nearly Rs. 290 billion.
