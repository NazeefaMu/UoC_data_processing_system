Ray of hope in Ravi K. saga

The Ravi Karunanayake saga has set off a chain of events that could see cases against members of the Rajapaksa regime, against whom there are serious allegations, expedited, and the wrong doers exposed. The Joint Opposition is clearly exulting in having succeeded in deflecting attention from the charges against their own members, by way of the alleged Bond scam. The resignation of Ravi Karunanayake too have given their campaign a fillip and egged them on to go all out to discredit the government. Not content with having Ravi K. removed, JO members such as Udaya Gammanpila are making a song and dance demanding that the Commission go the whole hog and expose the others involved in the episode. The fallout from the Ravi K. drama has given the worst culprits in the JO an opportunity to paint themselves as paragons of virtue. These members are hosting press conferences on a daily basis to hammer out on the subject and getting scribes from certain media to bowl full tosses in the form of slanted questions so that they could give the appropriate answers showing the government in poor light.
In a way, although Ravi K., rightly or wrongly, could consider himself a sacrificial lamb, his predicament has now given rise for investigations to be carried out in earnest against the Rajapaksas. The UNP wants a similar Presidential Commission to be appointed to probe the deeds under the Rajapaksa regime. UNP parliamentarians are naturally sore that one of their own members had been subject to much harassment when in fact the guns should be trained elsewhere. They are also not enamoured by the manner in which personnel of the Attorney General’s department subjected Ravi K. to a virtual inquisition although it is a great plus for the government in that its esteem may have risen among the public for having one of its own members subjected to such intense questioning, poor consolation though this might be for the UNPers. They naturally would ask what became of the charges against the Rajapaksas and what action has the AG’s department taken in this regard. This is particularly in the light of the revelation made by Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne that as much as 84 files pertaining to members of the Rajapaksa government were gathering dust at the AG’s department. There is also the public opinion to consider.
Hitherto, the public has been left wondering as to what became of the allegations leveled against the Rakapaksa regime on mega corruption. This is in the light of allegations of cover-ups, with the finger being pointed at the Attorney General’s department. Worse, there are charges of collusion within the government to let the Rajapaksas off the hook, with the finger pointed at a minister, no less.
However the Ravi Karunanayake episode has now precipitated action against the financial scams under the Rajapaksa regime. The zeal with which the Attorney General’s department went about its business of subjecting the former Minister to intense grilling has clearly angered the UNP. But it has also galvanized its members to demand a similar roasting of the wrong doers of the former government. They have even called for special courts to try the swindlers. Their agitation cannot be faulted. The main plank of the Yahapalanaya platform was to bring to book all the rogues and crooks of the Rajapaksa regime. But what is happening instead is a scenario where the hunter has become the hunted. It must be galling for the UNP that those with serious allegations and court cases pending against them are today shouting horse over the Bond scam, in an obvious attempt to throw dust in the eyes of the public. This is why the UNP wants investigations against the JO members, including Rajapaksa, be expedited.
Addressing the media, UNP firebrand Nalin Bandara has demanded that former Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal too be summoned before the Commission together with the former President. The member’s ire is understandable. There were serious allegations against the former CB Governor, not least of which is that his sister had been a director in the company now embroiled in the alleged Bond scam. Cabraal was also responsible for the Greek Bond fiasco that put the country in a massive financial hole. It is on his directives that millions of dollars was paid to PR firms in the USA to promote the image of Sri Lanka when there was a paid ambassador to perform the task. It was under Cabraal’s watch that the hedging deal was entered into that cost the country dearly and it is he who was in the forefront to promote Hambantota as a venue for the Commonwealth Games, undertaking a trip to the Caribbean, with sportsmen and starlets in tow, at massive cost. The UNPers are naturally angry as to why such colossal financial losses were allowed to go unanswered when one of their own is being put through the mill by counsel of the Attorney General’s Department assisting the Commission set up by their own government.
