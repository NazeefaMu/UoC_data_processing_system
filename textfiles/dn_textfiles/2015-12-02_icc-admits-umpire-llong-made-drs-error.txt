ICC admits umpire Llong made DRS error

The ICC has admitted that third umpire Nigel Llong made "an incorrect judgement" while using technology to decide on New Zealand's review of the appeal for catch against Nathan Lyon, which had been given not out on the field on the second day of the day-night Test in Adelaide.
"ICC has reviewed the decision and acknowledged that it was incorrect," it said on Twitter, adding that it had replied to New Zealand Cricket's questioning of the decision. "ICC confirms the umpire followed the correct protocol, but made an incorrect judgement."
The decision was hotly debated and criticised by television commentators and the media at the time, and drew unhappy but guarded reactions from New Zealand players Ross Taylor and Brendon McCullum, and the coach Mike Hesson because it had a significant impact on the Test.
Australia were 8 for 118 in reply to New Zealand's 202 on the second day when Lyon top-edged an attempted sweep off left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner into his shoulder and up to slip. New Zealand's appeal was denied on field by umpire S Ravi, and McCullum asked for a review.
After five minutes of replays, Llong upheld Ravi's decision though there was a clear Hot Spot on the top edge of Lyon's bat, and the batsman had walked halfway to the dressing room. There also seemed to be a deviation in the ball's course, but nothing showed up on Snicko, which also failed to read the impact of the ball on Lyon's shoulder.
Lyon had not scored at the time of his reprieve, and he eventually went on to make 34. Australia's last two wickets added 108 runs in all, and earned a first-innings lead of 22. New Zealand were dismissed for 208 in their second innings, and Australia chased down the target of 187 with only three wickets in hand.
