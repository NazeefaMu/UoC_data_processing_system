70th Independence Day to be celebrated as ‘One Nation’

Sri Lanka’s 70th Independence Day will be celebrated on a grand scale on the theme ‘One Nation’ at the Galle Face Green on February 4.
Sri Lanka, which was relegated to the background, will proudly celebrate this year’s Independence Day after winning over the international world and regaining its world image, said Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena in a press release.
The release said a member of the British Royal Family Prince Edward, the Earl of Wessex will attend the celebrations as a special invitee representing Queen Elizabeth II of England.
The British Royal Family has confirmed Prince Edward’s attendance at the 70th Independence Day celebrations following an invitation extended by the Foreign Affairs Ministry.
Several other foreign Heads of State and foreign delegates are also expected to attend this year’s celebrations.
The Home Affairs Ministry has made arrangements to introduce a special badge to mark the 70th Independence Day celebrations. It will depict the Independence Square and ‘70’ as a symbol of independence. On February 4 evening, a special cultural pageant and a musical show will be staged at the Colombo Town Hall Complex with the participation of a large number of local artistes.
A special traffic arrangement will be in operation in the Colombo city during the period of the Independence Day celebrations and the times on which rehearsals are made in preparation of the celebrations.
The Minister has also requested people to hoist National Flags in homes and state buildings on February 4 to mark the 70th Independence Day.
