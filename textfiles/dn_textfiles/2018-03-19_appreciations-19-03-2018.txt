[APPRECIATIONS - (19-03-2018)]

Rukie Eheliyagoda
She was selfless
As the curtain finally came down on March 19, 2017, Rukie Eheliyagoda, at 90 years of age, stepped off the stage of life. Love that transcended biological ties was snuffed out, leaving in her trail a colourful luminescence which the passing of time could hardly diminish.
My mother was content with herself just the way she was and allowed her soul the freedom to love, sing, dance and praise God. An exceptional feature in her character was her calm temperament; taking everything with a smile, be it hard times or jubilant times and was never tremulous or ruffled.
She was richly endowed with Joie de vivre and a radiant smile which glowed from within. Outward beauty and the beauty of the soul were both hers in abundance. She was a raconteur par excellence and together with her great sense of humour, set alight a sparkle to her lively conversations. It is no secret that my mother endeared herself to anyone who met her for the first time within a few minutes.
She had an inseparable connection with her family that was deep and symbiotic. It was characterised by an axial relationship. Her family mattered to her the most, evidenced by the abundance of love, care and giving that surrounded her happy home of spouse, five children, four grandchildren and three great grandchildren. During my junior school days, I would constantly fall ill during exams and each time, I never failed to find my mother armed with Disprin and a flask of coriander, waiting near the school gate for the interval. She gave each of her five children her undivided attention, even as four out of the five, came in pairs.
Hers was a life full of selfless care for others. Kindness, compassion and altruistic generosity rained like confetti. She offered a sincere and unbridled friendship especially in the darkest hours. Her heart remained flooded with kindness to the very end.
She possessed an indefatigable zeal for labouring in God’s kingdom and was equipped with a seemingly inexhaustible supply of energy and enthusiasm.
God’s blessings beyond measure were showered on this gracious and indomitable lady from the beginning to the end of her glorious life.
During our years growing up, our home was filled with prayers as she would gather her family around her daily after dinner. Her faith in Jesus Christ was so deep-rooted that no storm in life ever succeeded in paralysing her faith. Her conversations hardly ended without her boasting of how great and good the Lord was. Her well-lived and fulfiled life is our legacy. Her deep and unfathomable love was her gift to us and our endless fond memories of her is the comfort in our hearts that will linger on.

Ariyadasa Ratnasinghe
Versatile writer
It is unbelievable that 13 years had passed since the demise of versatile writer Ariyadasa Rathnasinghe, who contributed immensely to Sinhala and English newspapers and magazines for well over four decades. His vast knowledge in History, Buddhism, Literature and almost all other fields was marvellous.
His writings were full of information and inspiration, which were always arranged in a way that gripped all readers.
It was wonderful how he could find enough time to gather such a vast knowledge in so many fields and produce such valuable writings admits his responsibilities at state institutions. It is also not a secret that many journalists sought his assistance regularly in order to gather information and to clear doubts they came across during their pursuits. It was evident by the sheer numbers gathered at his funeral; they expressed their gratitude to him for sharing his knowledge with them during their times of need. His vast knowledge and faith in Buddhism made him a strong personality that could bear anything; all the ups and downs he faced in life. He was a rare personality in present day society and a gentlemen par excellence.
His loss is immensely felt by his family as well as everyone who knew him. It is true that he left an indelible impression on many journalists and readers. May he attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana.
