Cabinet nod for school uniform materials

The Education Ministry has received Cabinet approval to offer school uniform materials instead of issuing vouchers, the Education Ministry said.
Following the cabinet approval received on November 22, the Ministry has taken a policy decision to offer uniform materials again.
The former government had been issuing vouchers to students from 2016, discontinuing the earlier practice of issuing uniform materials.
The cost for issuing uniform material is less than that of issuing vouchers.Rs 550 million can be saved by issuing uniform materials. Uniform materials are purchased from local producers and therefore it is an encouragement for local producers.
