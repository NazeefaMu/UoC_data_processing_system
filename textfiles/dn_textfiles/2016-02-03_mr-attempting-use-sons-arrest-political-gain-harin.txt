MR attempting to use son's arrest for political gain - Harin

Telecommunications and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando yesterday said when one observed the reaction of Rohitha Rajapaksa on the arrest of Yoshitha Rajapaksa, this was proof of their aggressive behaviour while in power.
He was addressing a press conference at the Sirikotha UNP Headquarters yesterday. Replying to the social media post by Rohitha Rajapaksa, "Dear Yahapalanaya, you just stood on the tail of the lion, now don't expect the lion, not to rip u in to parts,"the minister said, "This challenge comes at a time when they were left out of power. Can you imagine what would have happened in the country if this had happened when they were in power?".
He further criticized the way former President Mahinda Rajapaksa attempted to use the arrest of his son Yoshitha for political gain, stating that this kind of behaviour exhibits his (Mahinda Rajapaksa's) political bankruptcy.
"Why did 6.2 million people vote for President Maithripala Sirisena on January 8 and why did all civil society organizations come together at that election? All of them fought against the law of the jungle and dictatorship. We have no hatred towards anybody and we did not serve milk rice on streets when he was arrested," he said.
"We are accomplishing a duty of the Government. This is public money. We need to find out how these black money came into the country. This is a good lesson for all, including those in the present Government. The arrest came after persistent investigations since March 20, 2015. The arrest has been made to facilitate uninterrupted investigations," .
If he has not done anything wrong, there is nothing to agitate over. Let him show how this money was found," he commented.
Foreign Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva requested the people to hoist the correct national flag to mark Independence Day and celebrate the real freedom in harmony with all communities.
