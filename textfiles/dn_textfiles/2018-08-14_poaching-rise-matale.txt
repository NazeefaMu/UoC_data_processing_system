Poaching on the rise in Matale

Poaching is on the rise in forest reserves along the borders of the Matale district recently.
Deer, sambur and wild boars are hunted in the Wasgamuwa, Sigiriya and Kahalle-Pallekele sanctuaries regularly, residents of the area said. Certain guest houses near sanctuaries sell illicit meat at Rs.1,000 per kilogram with high demand for it from local and foreign tourists. Villagers said that poachers were killing wild animals assisted by government officials. Their said, therefore, it would be difficult to curb such activities.
If it continues, wild animals in the areas will disappear in the near future, they said.
