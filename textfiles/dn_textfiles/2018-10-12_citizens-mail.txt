Citizens' Mail

Action plan to recover the tax arrears
At present, there are 341 Councils operating in Sri Lanka.
a) Municipal 24, b) Urban 41, c) Divisional 276
It is very important that taxes are collected on time to fund necessary investments in public infrastructure services and well-targeted policies etc. Recently, Commissioner, Badulla Municipal Council had announced that about Rs. 80 million is in arrears. It is possible that total dues islandwide could be to the tune of billions. The ratepayers are -
a) Government Departments, b) Semi-Government Department, c) Private enterprises, d) Individuals
Several steps could be taken to collect all dues on time.
a) The issue of a warrant with penalty and cost, b) Seizure of property, c) Lien, d) Freezing of Bank accounts
It may be better to appoint private Tax Collectors for efficient action though it has some drawback. Recently Municipal Council for Dehiwela, Mt. Lavinia had called for a quotation to appoint private Tax Collectors. Others also could follow this. It is doubtful as to whether these steps could be taken in the case of Government Departments and Semi-Government Departments. Such matters should be referred to the respective Ministers and the Treasury. Even Parliament could take action if proper reports are submitted on time.
This is an appeal to President Maithripala Sirisena, for immediate action as this matter is of paramount importance.
The support of the powerful media should also be sought.
