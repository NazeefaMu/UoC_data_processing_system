Ethnic harmony vital
It was in 2015 that this government came into power with a strong promise to establish democracy and good governance. Establishing communal harmony too was at the top of the new government’s agenda.
As a citizen who supported the idea of good governance, I would like to mention that this government has played a tremendous role in promoting ethnic harmony and peace in the society.
Being a country still experiencing the consequences of a thirty-year old war, Sri Lanka has a long way to go in order to become a developed nation. However during this short period the new government has been able to portray the country in a positive manner in the international arena. We have an unbiased foreign policy unlike in the past. Many foreign investors have agreed to invest in the country and tourism is booming with many tourists visiting this amazing island.
However still there are negative minded people who are not ready to admit the achievements we have gained so far during these three years. They try to spread communal disharmony through various means including social media. Despite being warned against unlawful acts, such posts are added to social media day-by-day. Strict action should be taken against those who try to create ethnic disharmony.
