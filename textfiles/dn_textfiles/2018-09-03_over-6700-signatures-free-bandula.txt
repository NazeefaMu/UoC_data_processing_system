Over 6,700 signatures to free Bandula

The petition requesting the release of Bandula, an elephant at the Dehiwala Zoo, exceeded 6,700 signatures by yesterday.
Bandula has spent 66 years chained at the zoo.
The petition, following its completion, will be presented to President Maithripala Sirisena, its organisers told the Daily News.
The petition which is available online has been initiated by media personality and former Consul General for Sri Lanka in Toronto, Bandula Jayasekara.
Dilum Alagiyawanne, who is a part of this endeavour, responding to the Daily News, said that they are hoping to collect as much signatures as possible before concluding the process in the next couple of weeks. He said that elephant and animal lovers, both local and global, have responded to this petition eagerly.
Alagiyawanne said that they are trying their best to get all eight elephants which are currently at the Dehiwela Zoo freed. “We have many wild elephants in the country. So they need not be kept at the zoo as well. Therefore, if we can release these caged animals to a better place like Ridiyagama Safari Park, it would be a great step ahead,” he added.
