The Commonwealth Local Government Forum (CLGF) 2019 will be held for the first time in Sri Lanka under the theme of, “Citizen centered local government: driving inclusive social and economic change” from June 11 to 14 in BMICH.
Sports and Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Mustapha said at a media briefing in Colombo yesterday Sri Lanka will host the Annual General Meeting and the International Conference of the CLGF with over 600 attendees comprising heads of governments, ministers, mayors, elected representatives of local government, senior officials and other professional and academics.
This is the first time that the is held in an Asian Country,” he said.
He said the event would give opportunity to enhance the voice of local government structures and ensure better connectivity and support within the Commonwealth framework.
The CLGF will boost tourism sector. It includs a private sector exhibition to showcase the skills and specialties of Sri Lankans.
The event will enable Sri Lanka to share experience and learn from other professional, which will help the local government structure to strengthen and empower its members to meet future challenges.
He said ocal government is important for the general public as most of the matters from persons’ birth to death is handled by the local government. We want to bring people and local government very closer as it will create close public supervision of local government while increasing efficiency thereby reducing corruption. Right now, most of the local government bodies are depended on the central government. This forum will point the way to make them more autonomous.
“We have taken measures to increase the women’s representation in local government bodies by 25 per cent and LG bodies are now efficient and have less corruption. There is a proposal to submit a Cabinet paper to make it possible for women organisations to get certain projects from the local government bodies to give women more opportunities to uplift their living standards and increase their productivity,” the Minister said. The CLGF logo and theme were ceremonially unveiled by the Minister Faizer Musthafa at the event.
