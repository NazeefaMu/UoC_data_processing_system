Five players penalised under ECB Discipline Code

The England and Wales Cricket Board’s Cricket Discipline Commission (CDC) confirmed that Tino Best, Ravi Bopara, Liam Livingstone, Ross Taylor and Philip Salt have received penalties under the ECB’s Directives. Best was reported by umpires Martin Saggers and Neil Bainton during Hampshire’s NatWest T20 Blast match against Essex on 24 June for a Level Two breach of the code (throwing the ball at or near a player, umpire or official in an inappropriate and dangerous manner). Bopara was reported by the umpires during the same match for a Level Two breach of the code (showing serious dissent at an umpire’s decision by word or action).
The penalty for each of these breaches is three penalty points.
Livingstone was reported by umpires Jeff Evans and Graham Lloyd during Lancashire’s NatWest T20 Blast match against Worcestershire on 24 June for a Level One breach of the code (showing dissent at an umpire’s decision by word or action).
