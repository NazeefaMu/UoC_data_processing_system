Nuclear medicine to detect diseases

Lanka Hospitals pioneers nuclear medicine in Sri Lanka, becoming the only private hospital to offer this service. Nuclear medicine is a branch of medical imaging that uses small amounts of radioactive material to diagnose and determine the severity of or treat a variety of diseases, including many types of cancers, heart disease, gastrointestinal, endocrine, neurological disorders and other abnormalities within the body.
Because nuclear medicine procedures are able to identify molecular activity within the body, it provides the opportunity to identify disease in its earliest stages, as well as a patient’s immediate response to therapeutic interventions.
Speaking on the subject, Lanka Hospitals, Consultant Nuclear Medicine, Dr. Udugama said Nuclear medicine is used in a very safe manner in order to get the maximum benefit and minimum exposure to the patient.
“Many medical procedures like X-ray and CT use radiation to diagnose and treat patients. Before deciding to recommend nuclear medicine procedure to a patient, we first have a consultation to determine if the patient is eligible for the process and if it is really necessary. Then, we use only the highest quality pharmaceuticals in the market in our tests and the smallest dosages necessary to diagnose our patients,” he said.
Dr. Udugama added that the use of radioactive substances (Radioisotopes) in nuclear medicine is governed by an international body, known as the International Atomic Energy Authority, which enforces strict guidelines and safety criteria.
Nuclear medicine is very commonly used to detect cancer spread, particularly cancer spread in to bone, from the breast or lung. Further nuclear medicine is also useful in detecting sports injuries, such as those occurring as a result of over exercising, or using the wrong techniques. Radioisotopes use in Nuclear medicine does not typically have any side effects with intravenous injections or radiation and it rapidly eliminates from the body. The nuclear medicine center at Lanka Hospitals offers a wide spectrum of Nuclear Medicine Imaging and has been in operation for the past 15 years, since its beginnings in 2002.
