England’s Greatest Test XI revealed

As England prepare for their 1,000th Test match on Wednesday against India, the ECB have announced the nation’s greatest ever Test side.
Over 6,000 English cricket fans voted and the team consists exclusively of Test legends, including three from the current squad – James Anderson, Alastair Cook and Joe Root.
England skipper Root was overwhelmed with his inclusion, saying: “To be selected in the best-ever England men’s Test XI side by cricket fans across the country is incredibly humbling.
“When I think of some of the incredible players who haven’t made the cut, legends of the game such as Denis Compton and Wally Hammond, I’m not sure I would have voted for myself, but I certainly want to thank the fans for thinking of me.
“It’s great to see my current team-mates Alastair Cook and James Anderson be recognised for their contributions to England Test cricket too."
