Shrinking  Matt Damon

‘My plan is the following,” announces Alexander Payne, who at 56 recently became first-time father to a baby girl. “From zero to eight, only silent films. From eight to 12, talkies. And then on her 12th birthday, colour. And if it means we have to home school her, so be it.”
No Netflix? No TV?
“Yes,” he concedes. “We’ll have a black and white TV.”
Downsizing, it seems, is more than just the name of Payne’s new movie — but it is also that. His seventh feature as director stars Matt Damon as a self-effacing Omaha physical therapist who agrees to be shrunk to the size of an iPhone after being sold a dream of the minimalist life, but soon finds himself diminished in other ways. He is in many ways a typical Payne protagonist, a man beaten down by life to the point of cracking, next in line to Matthew Broderick’s disgraced schoolteacher in Election, Paul Giamatti’s wine-soaked misanthrope in Sideways and George Clooney’s floundering father in The Descendants.
If Payne put any of himself into these characters, it doesn’t show. The director, Nebraska-born but of mostly Greek descent, greets me in an upscale London hotel suite looking entirely unruffled in cotton shirt and slacks. He is perched on a sofa, eyes owlishly alert and slightly piercing, his tone cool and relaxed.
We begin by talking about Damon, who since our meeting has made headlines for his squirm-inducing comments on sexual harassment but was better known for recent films in which he was made to squirm on screen: The Martian and Suburbicon and now Downsizing. I observe that Damon seems to have become the go-to-actor for every American director looking to cast a middle-aged ordinary Joe.
“Well, we don’t have another one among people between let’s say 35 and 55,” says Payne. “Tom Hanks is now 60. Who do we have? All these muscle-bound guys named Chris. And for a movie like this I needed a Jack Lemmon, a James Stewart, someone you can believe is an everyman, and I needed a star because it was a big-budget film.”
Downsizing represents something of an upscaling for Payne, not only in terms of budget (a hefty $68m) but in scope, cast, locations and visual effects. For while it starts small — with Damon and wife Kristen Wiig diminutised but finding it only amplifies their marital discord — Payne and regular co-writer Jim Taylor extrapolate the story out across a global canvas. Says Payne: “We thought: what if we take that premise ridiculously seriously, and say that Norwegian scientists think it’s the only possible solution to overpopulation and climate change? Then it becomes a prism through which to see a lot of things, as science-fiction premises often are.” Financial Times
