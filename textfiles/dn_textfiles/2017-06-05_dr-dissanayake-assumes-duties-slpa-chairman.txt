The shipping lines have got enormous power over the selection of ports.
Last year the top 20 container shipping lines lost about US$ 15 billion pointing to the enormity of the global challenges we are faced with. And more importantly, the East-West trade route where the Port of Colombo is situated, we should understand that within the next two years, the ships plying will have 90% of Ultra Large Container vessels,” Dr Dissanayake added.
