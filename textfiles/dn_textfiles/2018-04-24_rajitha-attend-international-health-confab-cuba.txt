Rajitha to attend international health confab in Cuba

On a special invitation extended by the Cuban Health Minister, Dr. Rajitha Senaratne will lead a four-member delegation to the international convention ‘Cuba Salud 2018’, being held from April 23 to 27, in Cuba, a Health Ministry spokesman said.
According to the spokesman, the convention organised by Cuba’s Public Health Ministry and attended by health ministers from 42 countries, together with over 3,000 delegates from 82 countries, will serve as a forum for discussing a global health agenda and other topical issues. Key health sector personnel, including World Health Organization Director General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, will attend the convention.
The scientific forum will promote discussion on the current and future challenges of Public Health globally, with emphasis on issues such as safety and quality of medical care, emerging diseases, efficient and sustainable health systems, international cooperation in health, medical education, universal access and universal health coverage, among others. Likewise, the current public policies, strategies, organization and economic bases that sustain health activity will be discussed, as well as the evaluation of the new processes for the renewal of primary care and its implications for health services, he said.
Minister Senaratne is billed to deliver a special address on Sri Lanka’s success story in achieving sustainable development goals in Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and also participate in various panel discussions.
Minister Senaratne will also hold discussions with Cuban authorities on ongoing and future bilateral cooperation in the health sector, he added.
