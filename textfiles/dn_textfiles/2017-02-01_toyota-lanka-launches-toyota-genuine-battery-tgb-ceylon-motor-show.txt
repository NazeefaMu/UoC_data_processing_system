Toyota Lanka launches Toyota Genuine  Battery TGB at Ceylon Motor Show

Toyota Lanka launched the Toyota Genuine Battery at Ceylon Motor Show on January 28. Exclusively engineered and individually designed for each Toyota model, this battery is able to withstand harsh conditions and requires little or no maintenance.
The Toyota Genuine Battery (TGB) is designed to harness optimal performance by catering to a vehicle’s specific requirements. Generic vehicle batteries available at present are designed to be compatible with many types of vehicles of varying requirements, and are therefore not tailored to a specific vehicle’s requirements, losing out on its capacity for power and efficiency.
Toyota engineers have equipped TGB with high quality calcium alloy-grids, segregated into several ‘sizes’ depending on the Toyota vehicle type. This allows the battery to function at peak performance, as it fits the exact specifications of the vehicle. The battery fights corrosion with a thick cast positive grid, stronger alloy components and double dip protection. It can also combat fluid loss and vibration, and enables superior cycling for optimal performance.
With the TGB, Toyota vehicle owners will receive free maintenance services, a two year warranty from the date of purchase, free monthly inspection by Toyota or authorized dealers and free of charge replacement and rectification of battery failure within the warranty period in the unlikely event of a manufacturing defect. The battery can be purchased from all island wide Toyota Lanka branches and authorized dealers.
At the launch, Toyota Lanka Priyantha Perera introduced the Toyota Genuine Battery to attendees, noting that their battery maintenance troubles were now over. “The typical car battery requires regular maintenance, and often doesn’t perform at optimum capacity as it hasn’t been designed for a particular vehicle,” he noted.
“With TGB the idea is to bring a superior quality product to our customers to yield the best performance from their Toyota.”
The launch was attended by Managing Director Shungo Yoshioka, Director and CEO Manohara Athukorala, General Manager Spare Parts, Lubricants and Car Care Priyantha Perera, and TGB Team Leader Anton Roshane.
Toyota Lanka is renowned for unparalleled after sales services across the island, even being recognized as the Best Sales Provider in the region by Toyota Tsusho Corporation in 2015.
