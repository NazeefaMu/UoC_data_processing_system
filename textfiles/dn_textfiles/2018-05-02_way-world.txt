Way of the World

“Everyone born into this world wishes to be happy. And so people are continually searching and striving for their happiness. It has been like this since we were little. Even before we can speak properly, we are already seeking things to satisfy us. As small children, we express our wants through our studies and acquire as much knowledge as possible so we can get a good job. We assume that having a good job and earning a lot of money which make us happy and at ease.”
These words quoted from the English translation of a series of Thai Dhamma talks delivered by Ajahn Anan Akincano are titled as The World and the Heart. As a reader, I found the five discourses as translated into English are full of spiritual insights packed with varying types of Dhamma anecdotes resembling the Zen type of tales and dialogues akin to versified dictums as delivered by Venerable Ajahn Chah with whom Ajahn Anan had been a close associate, a student and a personal assistant.
Ample examples
Proceeding from the known facts of the day to day life, Ajahn Anan takes the reader (or the listener in the first instance) to a world of multiple activities, where the innermost understanding is made to be clear with ample examples. Instead of propagating a strict rule or dogma in Dhamma, Ajahn allows the respondent to see ‘the way of the world’ and to ‘realise how it affects’ individuals. He says ‘this is the way of the world and this is how it has always been’.
Sentence by sentence, the respondent is allowed to think and interpret for oneself where he or she stands in the way of the world. This he says: “When we are gone, a new generation emerges. It will be like this for them as well. As such, nothing changes. Then comes the paradoxical statement that goes as though we are born and others follow into this world, we fail to see the world.”
The discourse continues as a stream. We become addicted to the ways of the world. What is meant to be an addiction is then exemplified.
We are addicted to forms, sounds, smells, flavours and tactile sensations. Given thought to these factors, the inevitable question is whether they last. These don’t last as the world changes. Arising and ceasing, they undergo change and transformation over time. Followed by these, Ajahn Anan states:
“For this reason, the Buddha cautioned his disciples in the following words: Look at the world beautiful and enticing like a royal chariot. Those without wisdom are bound by the world. But those who know are not bound.”
Interspersed understanding
This explanation culminates in the teachings of the concept of captivating wisdom known in the canon as panna or pragna. This is explained as a great form of understanding interspersed with the two main factors of sila and samadhi. The precepts may look high flown or laid down as untraceable by the common folk. But the respondent is made to follow them devoid of barriers based on simple practices.
These practices include the taming of the mind commencing from simple meditations to higher forms gradually laid down in other chapters. The reader-respondent is made to be aware of the ways of the world as a conclusive measure as follows: “During the course of one day, there is endless arising and ceasing. If one sees the nature of these thoughts and feelings as they arise and cease this means that we see the world.”
As the next interlinked discourse the reader is made to perceive Finding the Path which deals mainly with the concept as laid down in four lines that go as follows:
Sabba papassa akaranan (refraining from all wrongdoing)
Kusalassa upasampada (bringing goodness to perfection)
Sachittapariyo Dapanan (making the mind pure and unblemished)
Etam Buddhanasasanan (these are the teachings of all the Buddhas)
Noble path
In order to exemplify the teachings of all Buddhas, Ajahn takes the eight steps as laid down in the Noble Path known as Arya Ashtangika Magga (Noble Eight-fold Path). Though the average layman knows about this path, the inner layers could be well interpreted and analysed based on the wisdom one had gained. What is simply taught come to mean in a simple question raised: do you know what you are doing? Are you doing the right thing? If you do the right thing, you will reach a sanctity so far unreached. But if you do the wrong thing you will fall into a dismal state, perhaps unknown to you. This is explained as light and dark. Who likes to be in darkness? It is the light of wisdom one needs.
In the chapter titled as ‘From Wisdom, Freedom’, some of the teachings of the prophetic Zen type storyteller Ajahn Chah are laid down as examples to clarify some Dhamma dogmas. In one instance, it is recorded that when the new ordination hall at Wat Non-Pah Pong developed cracks in the cement, a layman had come to inform Ajahn Chah. “That’s right,” he told the layman.
“If the hall didn’t crack like this, there wouldn’t have been a Buddha! You see? These things are impermanent. It is just natural – no matter how well built they change according to causes and conditions.”
Then it is stated that thought the venerable monk had stated in that manner, he had not discouraged any repair as a measure to amend it.
Interesting anecdotes
More Zen type anecdotes follow in order to exemplify simple teachings in a creative manner that could be perceived by the common folk. Once a discourse comes to be on the precept and practice. Some monks from South Korea had come to see Ajahn Chah. One question raised happens to be: Why do we need to practice? What is the purpose of practice? How should we practice? What result can we expect from practice?
The Zen type answer on the part of Ajahn Chah had been like this.
“Why do we need to eat?
Let’s all think about this.
Why do we need to eat?
What’s it for?
How do we go about eating and once we have eaten, what is the result?
This is how he answered and they understood.
In this manner, the series of talks takes the reader on the way for the world and the heart.
