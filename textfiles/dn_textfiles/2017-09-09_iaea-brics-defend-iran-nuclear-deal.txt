IAEA, BRICS defend Iran nuclear deal

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) came to the defense of Iran in announcing that Iran’s nuclear programme is being subjected to “the world’s most robust” nuclear inspection regime.
IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano made the remarks at a panel discussion on global nuclear governance in the Bled Strategic Forum in Slovenia earlier this week amid Washington’s pressure on the agency to request access to Iran’s military sites.
Amano hailed the “important” role played by the UN nuclear agency in the finalization of the landmark accord, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), saying that the JCPOA “represents a clear gain for nuclear verification.”
“Iran is subject to the world’s most robust nuclear verification regime. Our inspectors are on the ground 24/7. We monitor nuclear facilities, using permanently installed cameras and other equipment,” he added.
Under the deal, Amano said, Iran has accepted restrictions on its nuclear programme and the IAEA has expanded access to its sites and information.
The deal demonstrated that even complex issues can be resolved if all parties were committed to “dialogue aimed at achieving results,” he said. The remarks came at a time when Washington, which is a party to the agreement, seems to be laying out a case for abandoning it.
US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley travelled recently to Vienna to press the IAEA on accessing Iran’s military sites.
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has commented that the US was “openly hostile toward the JCPOA and determined to undermine and destroy it.”
The IAEA has recently reaffirmed Iran's adherence to its commitments under the nuclear agreement. The Trump administration has twice certified Iran’s compliance with the deal. The next deadline is in mid-October.
In a joint statement issued during their latest summit in the Chinese city of Xiamen on Monday, the BRICS countries — Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa — also defended the accord saying, “We firmly support the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on the Iranian nuclear issue and call upon all relevant parties to comply fully with their obligations and ensure full and effective implementation of the JCPOA to promote international and regional peace and stability”.
The JCPOA was reached between Iran and the P5+1 group of countries — namely the US, Russia, China, France, and Britain plus Germany — in July 2015 and took effect in January 2016. Under the deal, Iran undertook to put limitations on its nuclear programme in exchange for the termination of all nuclear-related sanctions against Tehran.
Church leaders condemn Israel action
Patriarchs and heads of local churches in Jerusalem condemned the Israeli military court ruling that allowed settlers to take over properties belonging to the church as “unjust” and “politically motivated”.
In a statement addressed to Christians around the world, church leaders accused Israel of failing to protect Christian rights in the holy land. They also appealed to Christians, as well as the heads of governments, and all people of good will, to support them in their efforts to ensure that no further attempts are made by Israel against the Palestinian Christian community.
The ruling allowed settler groups to seize two hotels and a large building in the Old City of Jerusalem, which belongs to the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate.
Now Palestinian Christian population only make up two percent of the population of both Israel and Palestine – the number used to be around 15 percent. In Bethlehem alone, the Christian population has slumped to 7,500 from 20,000 in 1995.
Yusef Daher, executive secretary of the World Council of Churches says that the sharp decline in the number of Christian Jerusalemites is a result of Israel’s attempt to Judaize Jerusalem and slowly erode its Christian and Muslim Palestinian heritage: “The Israeli government policy throughout the whole history has been unilateral: turning Jerusalem both into a Jewish city and into the capital of Israel, while getting rid of all the Christian [and Muslim] Palestinians,”.
Similar concerns were raised in the joint statement by the patriarchs and heads of local churches.
Venezuela donates flood relief to USA
Strangely enough Venezuela under added US sanctions and under threats of US to ‘topple the regime’ has donated US$5 million to aid recovery efforts in the US states of Texas and Louisiana, which have been battered by the country’s worst hurricane in decades.
“Let's not allow war or threats to be imposed, but instead let's impose solidarity. We will always be with the people of the United States and the peoples of the world in difficult times,” Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza said. He also said Venezuela offered to send Venezuelan aid workers to the disaster zone, including doctors and emergency personnel.
In addition, a percentage of all gasoline sales from Citgo, the US subsidiary of Venezuelan state oil firm PDVSA based in Houston will be dedicated to the construction of homes for victims of Hurricane Harvey.
