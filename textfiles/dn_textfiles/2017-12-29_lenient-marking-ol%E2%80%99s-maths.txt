Lenient marking for O/L’s Maths

As per the instructions of Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, steps have been taken to award marks in a reasonable way to candidates who sat for the G.C.E. (O/L) Examination - 2017 Mathematics.
This is a result of some parents and teachers countrywide expressing displeasure over several questions of the Mathematics paper claimed to be too difficult and complex.
Taking the opinions into account, the evaluation process of the subject would be altered so that no injustice is caused to any candidate, said B. Sanath Pujitha, Commissioner General of Examinations.
Meanwhile, the Education Ministry has made arrangements to accept appeals of students who have passed the Grade Five Scholarship Examination this year and wish to get admitted to popular and leading government schools countrywide.
Accordingly, students and parents who wish to make appeals can do so from January 15, 2018 to February 15, 2018.
The applications for the purpose can be obtained from the Ministry website www.moe.gov.lk. Duly filled application forms have to be directed to the Education Director, (School Activities) Ministry of Education, Isurupaya, Battaramulla under registered post, said Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam.
