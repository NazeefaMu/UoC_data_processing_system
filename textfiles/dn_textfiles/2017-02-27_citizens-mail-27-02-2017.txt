[CITIZENS' Mail - (27-02-2017)]

Much ado about standards
Any educationist would undoubtedly agree that the Sri Lankan education system is heavily flawed. These flaws are mostly observed in private education institutes, though some state education institutes are no better.
What the private education institutes lack mostly is the required standards in par with government regulations. These private institutes come up with fresh courses. Their intention is clear: to rake in money by hook or by crook. There is nothing wrong in any money-making venture. However, standards should be respected as well as adhered to at the same time. Standards are equally important as profits.
On the other hand most of the fresh courses are quite alien to the students. The plain show-off of a range of courses, both short term and long term, tempt a large crowd. This crowd includes pupils fresh out of school as well as their parents who want their children to better in education.
However they are blissfully unaware about the inferior standards of the education they are going to bestow their children with. Private institutes mushroom only to attract and fascinate a large crowd of innocent ignorant pupils.
Worse still, the private institutions lack discipline. They are aiming at the rich students for the sake of raking in more monies.
