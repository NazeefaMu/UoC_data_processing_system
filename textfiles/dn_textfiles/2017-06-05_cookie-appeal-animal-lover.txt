Cookie : An appeal from an animal lover

Cookie, a female cat aged about 9 months was found in my garden knocked down by a vehicle. She is a sweet cat, but disabled in the sense that the vet confirms that this disability is due to the accident. She is mobile, but the hind legs have to be dragged by hub move around. She can move fairly fast dragging her hind legs, but in the process causing injuries to her legs. I have three other cats with me whom I feed and one has littered. I intend being overseas for a while, so I am looking for a loving caring home for Cookie. - Y Malgahagamage, Dehiwala.
