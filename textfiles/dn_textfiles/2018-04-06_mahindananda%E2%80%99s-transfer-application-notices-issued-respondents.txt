Mahindananda’s transfer application: Notices issued on respondents

The Court of Appeal yesterday decided to issue notices on the respondents regarding a Transfer Application filed by former Sports Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage who sought an order transferring a case filed against him to any other court of competent jurisdiction other than the Colombo High Court presided over by High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga.
However, the Court did not make any interim order in connection with the Transfer Application and the matter was fixed for May 15.
The Court of Appeal two-judge bench comprised Justice Kumuduni Wickremasinghe and Justice Janak de Silva.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against Aluthgamage for allegedly purchasing a house worth Rs. 27 million at Kynsey Road, Colombo 7, over a complaint that he had allegedly purchased properties through illegally acquired money. High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga is the Colombo High Court Judge who delivered the judgment in the controversial sil redi (fabrics used by devotees to observe sil) distribution case.
Former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunge and former Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) Director General Anusha Palpita were sentenced to three years' rigorous imprisonment by the Colombo High Court for misappropriating Rs. 600 million of funds belonging to the TRC.
In his petition, Aluthgamage stated that High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga was a member of the Presidential Commission (PRECIFAC) which initiated an inquiry against members of the former regime and further said that the judge would deny a fair trial.
President’s Counsel Faizer Mustapha with Counsel Keerthi Tillekaratne instructed by Sanath Wijewardena appeared for Mahindananda Aluthgamage.
Senior State Counsel Janaka Bandara appeared for the Attorney General.
