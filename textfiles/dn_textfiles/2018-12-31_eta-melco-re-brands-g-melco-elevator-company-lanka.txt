ETA MELCO re-brands as A G MELCO  Elevator Company Lanka

With a growing global presence and recognizing dynamic business environment, the management of ETA MELCO announced the change in the company name to A G MELCO Elevator Company Lanka. The new identity reflects integrity, stability and continuity, keeping in line with the company philosophy to uphold the highest levels of credibility.
A G MELCO Elevator Company Lanka (formerly ETA MELCO Engineering) established operations in Sri Lanka in 1983 and has 35 years of experience in the field of supply, installation and maintenance of Mitsubishi elevators and escalators, and there are over 3,500 such units installed by the company across Sri Lanka.
The name change came as a result of corporate restructuring which however did not result in changes in staff or in the range of products and services offered by them.
The company will continue to operate as before, while their contact details, including location, phone and fax numbers remain unchanged.
The change in the company name will not impact their ongoing engagements, cooperation and obligations contractually or otherwise. AG MELCO operates in multiple geographies such as the Middle East, South Asia, Africa, Turkey and CIS countries. With over 40 years of business presence in the industry, AG MELCO looks forward to grow and serve customers in the global market.
