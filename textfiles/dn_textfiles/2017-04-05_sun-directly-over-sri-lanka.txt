Sun directly over Sri Lanka

On the apparent northward relative motion of the sun, it is going to be directly over the latitudes of Sri Lanka during April 5 and 15 in this year, the Meteorology Department said. The nearest areas of Sri Lanka over which the sun is overhead today, are Hambantota, Katudampe, Nakiyadeniya and Maliduwa about 12:13 noon. The Meteorolgy Department also said that due to this fact the areas where the Sun is overhead on a particular day will experience enhanced temperatures.
