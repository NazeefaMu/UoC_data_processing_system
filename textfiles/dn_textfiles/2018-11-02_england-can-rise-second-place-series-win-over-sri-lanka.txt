Exciting month of Test cricket on the cards:
England can rise to second place with series win over Sri Lanka

The sport’s traditionalists will have one eye on Asia where seven of the world’s proud Test playing countries will not only try to establish their dominance over their respective rivals, but will also aim to improve their rankings in the MRF Tyres ICC Men’s Test Team Rankings.
Bangladesh will play host to Zimbabwe and the Windies in a two-Test series each, England will travel to Galle for first of the three Tests against Sri Lanka, while the United Arab Emirates will be the stage for the three-Test series between Pakistan and New Zealand.
Virat Kohli’s India leads the Test team rankings, but only 11 points separate second-ranked South Africa from seventh-ranked Pakistan. This means there could be movement in the middle of the pack, depending on how the four series pans out.
Bangladesh can move ahead of the Windies in eighth place but to make that happen, they will have to win all the four Tests; England can rise to second, but will have to win the series; Sri Lanka can move ahead of fifth-placed Australia, but will have to win all the three Tests; New Zealand will rise to second irrespective of how Sri Lanka-England series ends if they sweep the three-Test series against Pakistan; while Pakistan can move ahead of Australia if they win 3-0.
Meanwhile, New Zealand captain Kane Williamson and James Anderson of England will be the highest-ranked Test batter and bowler, respectively, who will be in action in the ICC’s pinnacle format this month.
Williamson is presently ranked third in the MRF Tyres ICC Player Rankings for Test Batsmen, but England captain Joe Root is narrowly behind him in fourth position.
Dimuth Karunaratne of Sri Lanka is his side’s highest-ranked batsman in seventh position, Azhar Ali is Pakistan’s highest-ranked batsman in 15th spot, Mushfiqur Rahim is Bangladesh’s highest-ranked batsman in the absence of Shakib Al Hasan, while Brendan Taylor is Zimbabwe’s highest-ranked batsman in 46th position.
The Sri Lanka versus England series opener in Galle will be Rangana Herath’s 93rd and final Test. The left-arm spinner had made his debut at the same venue against Australia 19 years ago and will enter in his final Test as his side’s highest-ranked bowler in seventh place. With 430 wickets, he is his country’s second most successful bowler after Muthiah Muralitharan.
