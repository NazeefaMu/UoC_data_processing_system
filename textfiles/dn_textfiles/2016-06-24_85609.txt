Third force doomed: Wijithamuni

There is no place for a third political force in the present political environment that exists in the country today. Anyone trying to form a third political force against all odds will be relegated to political oblivion, Irrigation and Water Resources Management Minister Wijith Wijayamuni Soysa said.
He was addressing the SLFP weekly press briefing at the Sri Lanka Freedom Party headquarters yesterday.
The Minister added that after the formation of the SLFP by S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, no third political force has been successful.
The Minister noted that the SLFP is driven forward only with the decisions taken at the SLFP Central Committee and not the personal views of anyone. There are alternative views within the SLFP but the party is taken forward with the decisions taken at the Central Committee. When asked whether former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is not guilty of financial misconducts as stated by Cabinet Spokesman Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, the Minister said even though Mahinda Rajapaksa has not committed financial misconduct, the persons who were with him are responsible for various forms of irregularities and frauds.
“I personally believe that Mahinda is not a thief. But it can be said that his family members and persons who were with him have committed financial fraud and misconduct,” he said. Speaking on the next local government election he said that the SLFP is ready to face the forthcoming local government election.
