How blessed our nation with new election regulations enforced
It is obviously visible to everyone the differences past and present of pre campaigns for an election in Sri Lanka under the present regulations and laws enforced by the Election Authorities.
Comparing previous elections either Parliamentary or Provincial or Local Govt. it is very clearly visible that there is vast progressive step has taken to minimize unwanted violence among the public of the society/communities after the nominations handed over by the respective candidates for the upcoming Local Govt. elections scheduled to be held in February 2018 by the Department of Elections. This situation has come into force due to following restrictions considering the environmental status of the public as well as to avoid accumulating unwanted garbage dumping.
We experience no preferential voting, no cutouts, no banners with pictures, no decorations with colourful polythene (plastic materials), no canvassing house to house and crowd limited, no posters to be paste on public and other places, no many temporary election huts (booths) within the respective area of the candidate, and etc.
But there are things visible here and there in various places beyond the above restrictions, at this stage, our minds go back to the situation had about 60-65 years ago, when there was an election announced to take place either parliamentary/local Govt. People like us presently living at the age of 70’s or more can realize the difference very clearly. For an example, during the that period, still can remember how people moved within the election fever, to elect a member to represent for their own ward of the area, or to the parliament considering the value of the voting franchise of the public in a Democratic nation to achieve better living slandered with basic needs.
Still, it is to mention that those days only a few handouts with details with a symbol and the picture of the candidate printed on low-cost paper similar to the quality of newspaper material distribute within the area. So this is on the results of the stern decisions taken by the present Governing body to implement an impartial and free election system under the policies of Good Governess.
As per reports through media, although we find there are incidents takes place at some areas casually but it is believed and hoped that present situation will be able to maintain last long as until the scheduled elections fever over in this country. Hope for the best.
