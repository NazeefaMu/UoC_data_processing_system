First SAARC confab on NCDs held in Colombo

The first SAARC non-communicable diseases (NCDs) conference began at the Galle Face Hotel, Colombo, under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena on March 31.
The main objective of the conference was to share country-wise experiences of NCDs, to decide on common areas of interest with regard to controlling NCDs in the SAARC region and discuss and finalise the terms of reference for the SAARC annual meeting on NCDs.
The WHO has launched programmes in all countries to minimise NCDs caused by genetic factors and physical and environmental habits. People living in low and middle-income countries are largely subjected to NCDs like heart disease, cancer, respiratory problems, and diabetes, and it has been found that annually nearly 10 million deaths occur worldwide due to NCDs.
The main causes of NCDs are use of alcohol and tobacco, lack of exercise, and lack of a balanced diet. The WHO has also identified NCDs as a major obstacle towards the achievement of sustainable development goals.
As such, programmes have been launched worldwide to minimise NCDs by 2030.
The programme launched in Sri Lanka towards achieving this objective has been highly appreciated by the WHO which said it was a guideline for other countries.
Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, Deputy Minister Fasial Cassim, Ministry Secretary Janaka Sugathadasa, Director of the SAARC Secretariat and other officials were also present on the occasion.
The two day conference ended yesterday.
