Amended Local Government Election Bill endorsed by Speaker

 
Speaker of the Parliament Karu Jayasuriya endorsed the Amended Local Government Election Bill a short while ago.
The Bill passed into law with Amendments in Parliament last Friday, paving the way to hold the LG elections under a new electoral system.
The Bill was to give effect to necessary legal amendments to hold the LG elections under a mixed system, a hybrid of the first-past-the-post (FPP) and the proportional representation (PR).
Sixty percent has been allocated to the FPP representation, while 40 percent has been allocated to PR representation.
The legislation assures 25 percent quota to female representatives and it also abolishes the preferential voting system.
