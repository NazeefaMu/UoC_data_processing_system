Ireland's O'Brien steers MCC to win over Germany

FRANKFURT, Germany, Monday – Having scored his maiden century for Ireland earlier this month, Niall O'Brien fell just short of his second tonne in a fortnight in helping the MCC beat Germany on Monday.
Ireland's wicketkeeper was guesting in an invitational team for the Lord's-based MCC -- the Marylebone Cricket Club -- the world's oldest club, in
the first of their seven-game tour of Germany this week.
O'Brien's knock of 96 was the MCC's highest score as they scored 323-7 in the 50-overs match, then bowled Germany out for 247. "I enjoyed it, it was a nice pitch and they have a good attack, there are some good bowlers there," said O'Brien after sweltering conditions in Frankfurt.
"It's a shame I didn't get my hundred, but there is always tomorrow." O'Brien claimed his maiden international century for Ireland in Dublin two weeks ago, hitting 109 when New Zealand opened their tri-series with a 51-run victory.
However, he was left kicking himself -- literally -- about the way he gave his wicket away against Germany.
"It was a funny way to get out -- hitting my own wicket," he admitted.
"I tried to get inside the line of the ball to hit it to the leg side, but I stupidly kicked my stumps.
"It's the first time I've been out like that."
Minnows Germany have a second 50-overs match against the MCC in Frankfurt on Tuesday.
The hosts are preparing for next month's Europe Div One tournament, against the likes of Austria, Belgium, France, Norway and Sweden, which acts
as a World Cup qualifier. -AFP
