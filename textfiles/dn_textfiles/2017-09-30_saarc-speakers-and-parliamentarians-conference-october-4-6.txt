SAARC Speakers and Parliamentarians Conference from October 4 to 6

The eighth Conference of the Association of SAARC Speakers and Parliamentarians (ASSP) will take place from October 4 to 6 at Hotel Hilton in Colombo, Sri Lanka.
The Association of SAARC Speakers and Parliamentarians was set up in 1992 with the vision to promote friendship and understanding among the peoples of South Asia, promote coordination and exchange of information among Parliaments and Parliamentarians of SAARC countries and provide a forum for the exchange of ideas and information on Parliamentary procedures and practices of the region.
The first conference of the ASSP was held in India in 1995, followed by the second in Pakistan in 1997, the third in Bangladesh in 1999, the fourth in Sri Lanka in 2006, the fifth in India in 2011, the sixth in Pakistan in 2012, and the last in Maldives in 2013.
The eighth Conference, organized by the Parliament of Sri Lanka, will bring together Speakers and Parliamentarians from the member countries of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC).
The conference will be inaugurated by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister and Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs Ranil Wickremesinghe will deliver the keynote address at the opening ceremony to be held on October 4. Speaker Karu Jayasuriya will deliver the welcome speech at the inauguration.
This year’s conference is expected to place particular emphasis on Sustainable Development Goals, as the main theme will be ‘Association of the SAARC Speakers and Parliamentarians’: a platform for the Parliamentarians of South Asia to work together to reach the 2030 agenda for Sustainable Development.
The General Assembly also expects to hold discussions on “Promoting Parliamentary Diplomacy and Open Parliament in the age of digitalization” and “SAARC Parliamentarians’ role in preserving Cultural and Archaeological Heritage in South Asia Region”.
The meeting of the Women Parliamentarians’ Committee will be centred on the topic “Supporting Women to upheave themselves from poverty and build better futures for their communities.”
This year’s conference will also have the first meeting of the Young Parliamentarians’ Committee which will discuss “Countering violent extremism among youth to prevent terrorism and empowering youth to combat human trafficking, modern slavery and illegal trafficking in drugs.”
The conference will be followed by an excursion to Kandy (Dalada Maligawa and Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage) on October 6, arranged for the participants by the Parliament of Sri Lanka.
