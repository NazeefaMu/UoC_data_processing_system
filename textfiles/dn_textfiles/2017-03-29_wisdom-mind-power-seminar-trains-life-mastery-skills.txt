Wisdom mind power seminar trains life mastery skills

 Everybody is now in a rat race to obtain higher level of qualifications, intending to get better jobs for higher remuneration packages and also for prestige. We see various institutes offering MBA s’, MSc s’ and many other certificate level to post graduate level courses.
Thousands of people follow these and get certified and qualified. The question is whether they achieve the ultimate purpose of having such a certificate in their file. A very few individuals who have an outstanding personality would definitely achieve their targets.
Many others get frustrated by not reaching the next level in their life and profession, in spite of their paper qualifications.
How many of the adults passed out of the schools can face an interview successfully with confidence? How many of the University graduates can do justice to their degree certificates when they face the job interview? Although they have learnt English at school and university, how many can confidently speak the language fluently? Some people know grammar very well but they mumble when they have to speak a few words because of too much of grammar consciousness or because of language phobia.
School leavers, graduates, professionals and business leaders are all in the same boat.
One may perform very well in some areas and do very badly in some other areas.One may lack confidence to go to a stage and make a presentation or a speech to an audience. One may have hesitation to have fellowship in a social gathering, to mix up with people.
For instance, you may have observed that some people enjoy to the fullest singing ,dancing, chatting and having fun with every one around while you confine yourself to one or two known friends and spend the whole time with no much fun. You may perhaps suffer from the fear to move around. You may overdo things at such places not knowing the standard etiquette (manners) to follow.
Why struggle in the same level of life for years and suffer? In work life you may suffer with numerous communication problems, relationship issues, misunderstandings, not getting the promotion you want, earning too low when compared to the qualifications you have obtained. You may have studied overseas in a prestigious university and come back but you may have personality issues. You may be frustrated about life. You may be getting annoyed and angry for no big reason. You may lack people handling skills and therefore hate others while you are also being hated by others.
Trainer Kuma Iddamalena says the problem is not the problem but how you look at the problem. Whether it is a personal life problem, business or carrier issue the same theory applies. Learn to see the problem as it is, not bigger than that.
The mind power seminar on “Empowered Living” will help those in need.
