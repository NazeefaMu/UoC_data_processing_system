Late tries by Jason, Sandun sees Lanka home

The Asian Rugby Championship (ARC) Division I competition in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia was an exciting one where the Sri Lanka players showed some excellent playing skills and had that little bit of extra speed and energy to stave off stiff resistance from a determined Singaporeans by registering a hard fought 33 (4 tries, 2 conversions, 3 penalties) to 17 (3 tries, 1 conversion) points victory yesterday. Sri Lanka was trailing 17-15 at the breather.
The Sri Lanka forwards and back divisions combined with maximum commitment and played excellent rugby in sunny conditions. The Lankan forwards specially flankers Jason Dissanayaka, Sudarshana Muthuthantri, second row Sharo Fernando and number eight Buwaneka Udangamuwa were outstanding in the loose while in the back division half combination of vice captain Roshan Weerarathna and fly half Chanka Chandimal, centers Danushka Ranjan, Kanchana Ramanayaka and wingers Kavindu Perera, Sadun Herath fought all the way to bring about this victory.
Sri Lanka played to a set pattern and Singapore spent their time in trying to upset their plans which proved futile.
Sri Lanka shot into the lead through a 30 meter penalty put over by full back Reza Mubarak. Soon after off a beautiful three quarter move Ranjan darted down the left flank and dived over brushing aside the Singapore defender near the left corner flag for a superb try, the difficult conversion was missed by Mubarak and Sri Lanka went in to an 8-nil lead. The Tuskers further increased their lead when off a forward move captain cum number eight Sudarshana Muthuthantri crashed through for a try. Mubarak made the conversion to make it 15-nil.
A few minutes later in the 27th minute Singapore counter attacked and off a grubber kick Sri Lanka full back Mubarak made a silly fumble where they collected the loose ball through their winger Jay-Hykel Bin Jailani and scored an unconverted try which reduced the margin to 15-5.
In the 36th minute, off a five meter scrum Singapore’s burly expatriate number eight Peter William McFeely barged over Sri Lankan prop forward Kishore Jehan to score another unconverted try.
Just before lemons the fighting Singapore outfit was awarded a penalty try and expat Michael Richard Patterson made the conversion to grab the lead 17-15. After the resumption Sri Lanka fought back and obtained a 35 meter penalty kick which was successfully put over by Mubarak to take the lead 18-17. He was right on target with another 40 meter penalty and Sri Lanka increased their lead to 21-17.
A few minutes later Sri Lanka’s hard working open side flanker Dissanayaka picked up a loose ball and found the gap to touch down for a spectacular try foxing the entire Singapore defence. Mubarak once again was on target with his kick and Sri Lanka increased their lead to 28-17.
Sri Lanka’s never-say-die attitude proved to be a thorn in the flesh for Singapore when Chandimal opened the gap with a smart move and gave a fabulous off load to dashing Herath, who scampered through to touch down by the left corner flag. This time around Mubarak failed to add the extra two points but it was enough for the Tuskers to seal a hard fought victory.
Later in the day with the inclusion of nine Fijian imports host country Malaysia almost created a sensational shock before going down fighting by 10-15 to Philippines-Volcanoes who are ranked second behind Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka’s next fixture is against host Malaysia on May 11 at 4.30 pm SLT. - WAI
