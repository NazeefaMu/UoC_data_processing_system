Land development project under way

The Urban Development Authority (UDA) had launched a project to use 8,353 hectares of land in Hambantota for tourism and wildlife conservation recently.
The Hambantota UDA Director said that 100 acres of land in Warayanagaraya would be used for the tourism industry, while 150 acres of land would be set aside for wildlife conservation.
Certain lands in Kachcheri would be used for the Tower Hill Project. Furthermore, a 10-storeyed building would be constructed to house certain businesses and institutions that would be relocated, he added.
