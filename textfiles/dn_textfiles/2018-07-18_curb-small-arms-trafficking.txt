CURB SMALL ARMS TRAFFICKING

Sri Lanka has been fighting against the global trafficking of arms, arms, drugs and wildlife for some time. During the 30-year war, Sri Lanka was unable to fully cope with it. Post-war Sri Lanka has also been unable to cope with it for reasons which can be addressed immediately. These include the lack of political will, unwillingness to engage with the international community and lack of human and financial resource availability. Sri Lankan authorities should know that such transnational organised crime taking place in the country cannot be tackled without international support.
Addressing transnational organised crime taking place in post-war Sri Lanka should be one of the priorities of the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL). Otherwise it will sabotage ongoing peace and reconciliation efforts and badly impact on the country’s human rights record. Addressing this important issue directly will improve the human security afforded to citizens. There are seven essential issues associated with human security: economic security, food security, health security, environmental security, personal security, community security and political security.
Sri Lanka ended its 30-year armed conflict between government Security Forces and the LTTE in 2009. By the end of the war, Sri Lanka had almost cleared the threat to national security. But unfortunately, post-war Sri Lanka has yet failed to address the issues relating to human security and up to now, no lasting solutions have been found to address them. During the war, Sri Lanka took some impressive action, particularly against the illicit small arms trade. Soon after the war ended in 2009, such initiatives were stopped. Now post-war Sri Lanka is facing a spiral of crime taking place on a daily basis.
NCAPISA 2005-2008
When the UN’s Programme of Action (PoA) on small arms and light weapons was established in 2003, Sri Lanka actively engaged with the PoA. Sri Lanka carried out certain activities with the PoA which benefitted the country at large and were praised by the international community. With the support of the international community, Sri Lanka established the National Commission Against Proliferation of Illicit Small Arms (NCAPISA) in 2005 under the instructions of President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga.
The NCAPISA, with the support of civil society, collected over 35,000 illicit small arms and light weapons in the country, except in the war-torn Northern and Eastern Provinces, and destroyed them at Independence Square on International Gun Destruction Day on July 7, 2006. In 2006, the first Review Conference of the PoA was presided over by Sri Lanka which brought honour to the country. The then Sri Lankan Ambassador to the US Prasad Kariyawasam presided over the Review Conference.
Between November 2006 and April 2007, NCAPISA carried out a survey on the Prevalence of Illicit Small Arms, which was the first in the South Asian region. The survey report was published in 2008 with important recommendations for the NCAPISA, Executive and Parliament, Defence, Public Security and Law and Order Ministry, Security Forces, Police, Civil Security Department, Justice Ministry and Attorney General’s Department, Prisons, Government Analyst, Foreign Affairs Ministry, Health Services, Customs, Forestry, Agriculture and Wildlife Departments, Education Ministry, media and civil society.
Post-war Sri Lanka
The war ended in 2009 and at the same time the NCAPISA stopped functioning. It was unable to carry out any recommendations mentioned in the 2008 Survey Report of the Commission. From 2008 until now, neither has the government nor has any other party raised the importance of the re-establishment of the NCAPISA in post-war Sri Lanka. If this particular Commission existed today, the country could have avoided certain grave crimes. Not only are people getting killed, but also getting disabled physically or mentally and or both, due to such violence. Small arms cause 90 percent of civilian casualties. According to Sri Lanka’s Police Department crime statistics, 35,978 grave cries were reported in 2017.
Post-war Sri Lanka is directly or indirectly linked to the illicit trafficking of drugs and wildlife on a daily basis. These two illegal activities have direct links to illicit arms which is linked to the global arms trade. In other words, these three illegal activities are always interlinked to one another. During and after the war in Sri Lanka, underworld groups, political groups and certain individuals received various types of small arms through several means. It is believed that the LTTE sold their weapons to the South, military soldiers smuggled them, and previous governments distributed weapons to politicians but never collected them, and arms were smuggled through and airports and harbours.
Due to the circulation of illicit weapons in post-war Sri Lanka, underworld activities such as drug and wildlife trafficking, theft, ransom demands, contract killings, rape and various other crimes are soaring.
SL needs international support
Post-war Sri Lanka alone will not be able to eradicate illicit arms trafficking as mentioned earlier.
The international community has already pledged its support to Sri Lanka on this important matter, if Sri Lanka is willing to join this effort. Sri Lanka should show genuine commitment towards the matter and should carry out two important acts. The Survey Report of the NCAPISA recommended (page 18) that the Foreign Ministry should continue to play a strong and active role on behalf of the Sri Lankan government in strengthening international and regional instruments to control small arms, including the UN PoA and the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT).
The ATT, which came into force in 2014, promotes responsibility, transparency and accountability in the global arms trade. Further this treaty is critical to stopping weapons falling into the wrong hands. The ATT is particularly concerned about women and children who account for the vast majority of those adversely affected by armed conflict and armed violence. Further, the ATT and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2030 share common goals and purpose.
It is unfortunate that since 2009, post-war Sri Lanka did not engage with the UN PoA and the ATT. Due to the fact that post-war Sri Lanka did not engage with these two international instruments, the country itself failed to address the issue of proliferation of illicit small arms.
From next year onwards, Sri Lanka will start hosting the world’s largest international conferences like the Conference of the Parties (CoP) of the Convention on International Trade on Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The CITES always encourages governments around the world to fight against the illicit arms trade which has a direct link to wildlife poaching. Before the 18 CoP of the CITES, Sri Lanka as the host country should show commitment on the matter and accede to the ATT.
The way forward
Post-war Sri Lanka should immediately accede to the ATT and re-engage with the UN PoA programme this year. By engaging with these two international instruments the GoSL will be able to receive the necessary technical and financial assistance from the international community and carry out some of important activities in 2018 and 2019. These are: a) re-establishment of the NCAPISA (reviewing the previous mandate of the Commission with a new work plan); b) carrying out an islandwide survey on illicit small arms and light weapons; c) amending the Firearms (Amendment) Act No 22 of 1996 or bringing in a new Act on Firearms; d) reviewing the recommendations set out in the 2008 Survey Report of the NCAPISA; e) a public campaign against proliferation of illicit small arms; d) destruction of small and light weapons recovered by the Security Forces from the LTTE as well as destruction of other illicit arms at a public place. This could be organised during the 10th anniversary of the end of the war between the LTTE and government Security Forces.
Carrying out such activities will help to improve Sri Lanka’s human rights record and strengthen ongoing peace and reconciliation efforts. Post-war Sri Lanka should look for permanent solutions to the issues concerning human security rather than survive on day-to-day short-term political tactics on such important issues.
If post-war Sri Lanka fails to address issues relating to human security, no doubt the country will head towards a lawless state.
Implementation of the death penalty alone will not bring the desired results and that will only bring adverse publicity for the country.
