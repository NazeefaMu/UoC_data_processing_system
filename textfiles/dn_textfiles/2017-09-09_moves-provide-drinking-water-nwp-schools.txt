Moves to provide drinking water for NWP schools

There are 1,258 schools in Kurunegala and Puttalam Districts of the North Western Province and out of them about 650 schools lack drinking water facilities.
Therefore, steps will be taken soon to provide monetary aid to such schools to obtain drinking water. A sum of Rs. 25,000 would be granted to each school with the help of World Bank funds as students suffer due to non-availability of drinking water.
About 45 water bowsers belonging to local bodies within Kurunegala and Puttalam Districts would be utilized to supply drinking water to these schools from this week,” said Provincial Education Minister Sandyakumara Rajapakse.
