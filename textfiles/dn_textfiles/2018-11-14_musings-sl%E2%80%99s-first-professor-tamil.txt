Musings on SL’s first Professor of Tamil

Jeevanathi Publications in Yaalpaanam has published a few booklets covering Tamil Personalities in the Universities. They are written by Eelak Kavi (A H M Nawas), a teacher, writer and a literary critic from the Uva Province. The booklets are excellent and comprehensive accounts of the great scholars in Lankan Universities.
One of such professors is the first professor in Tamil not only in the then University of Ceylon but also the first ever Tamil professor in any university. He was Swami Vipulananda.
Ramakrishna Mission
Born on March 27, 1892, first as Thambipillai and later to be called Mylvaaganam by his parents, Saamithamby and Kannammai from Kaaraitheevu in the Eastern Province, he joined the Ramakrishna Mission as Swami Vipulananda.
Achieving academic qualifications and gaining experience as a teacher, he renounces the worldly life in Chennai (1924) and becomes Swami of the Ramakrishna Mission.
Upon his recommendation, the famous Annamalai University in Chidambaram in Thamilakam was established. He was requested to be its first Professor in Tamil in 1931. He worked there for two years.
First Tamil professor
In 1943, he was appointed as the first professor in Tamil in the then University of Ceylon.
One who knows Tamil should read this book to go into the depth of information that the Writer Eelak Kavi elaborates. I cannot translate this book into English at this juncture.
From page 1 to the first quarter of page 25 the writer compiles the quotations of others who have given their impressions on Swami Papulacandin and his works adding his own comments, more than 45 citations are there.
But the irony is none of my statements on the great scholar and his works are cited. I was the first to identify Swami Vipulananda as the first Tamil Literary critic in Lanka.
This shows most people don’ read the articles and books written by lesser-known writers and think it fit to quote only from academics.
Magnum Opus
In the second section, Eela Kavi writes about Swami Vipulananda’s Magnum Opus- the Yaarl Nool, a discovery of ancient Tamil musical instrument. The scholar’s interest in music is substantiated in this booklet. His research on Yaarl lasted nearly 15 years. The book was launched in 1947.
In the third section, the writer speaks about the interests the scholar had on Drama and Theatre. He liked Shakespeare and rendered into Tamil some of the Bar’s poetry. He wrote a book on Shakespeare’s work and the nature of drama titled Madanga Soolamani as far as 1926. However, he felt it was not satisfying to him.
Swami Vipulanda’s comparative studies on Sanskrit and western literature are pioneer works. Eela Kavi has taken pains to illustrate the pioneer works of Swami Vipulananda in elucidating his contribution to the poetry, music and theatre of the ancient Tamils.
In a nutshell, the writer has given the quintessence of the greatest Lankan Tamil scholar, Swami Vipulannda in this handy booklet. Congratulations to him.
