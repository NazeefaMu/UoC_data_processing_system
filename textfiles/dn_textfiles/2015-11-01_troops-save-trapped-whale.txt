Troops save trapped whale

A 70ft whale which had got trapped in fishing net was set free after an eight hour rescue operation by troops attached to the Security Forces Headquarters in Mullaitivu. The incident occurred last Friday in the sea near Kokilai in Mullaithivu. The whale had got entangled in a fishing net and had trouble getting itself free. Rough sea conditions caused by the inclement weather experienced in the region had also added to the plight of the whale's return to the sea.
Troops with the assistance of fishermen embarked on the operation to free the whale. Utilising backhoe machines the troops were able to free the whale and set it on its way back to the sea.
