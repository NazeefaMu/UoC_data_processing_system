Alleged war crimes: Hybrid Court could be set up under current Constitution: Sumanthiran

A Hybrid Court comprising local and foreign judges to inquire into allegations of war crimes and human rights violations could be set up under the current Constitution, Tamil National Alliance (TNA) spokesperson M.A. Sumanthiran said.
He also said that he was in the position with regard to the need of a hybrid court to inquire into allegations into war crimes and human rights violations.
Sumanthiram said that Constitutional reforms should focus on facilitating a Hybrid Court if the current Constitution could not support it.
Sri Lankan constitution does not allow foreign to inquire into allegations of war crimes and human right violations, Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
Sumanthiran further said that Government’s position on this matter could not be accepted.
