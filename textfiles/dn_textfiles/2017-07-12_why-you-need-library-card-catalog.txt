Why you need a library card catalog

My dream home contains three very simple and reasonable commodities: lots of floor-to-ceiling bookshelves with a rolling ladder, a comfy window seat for marathon reading sessions, and an antique library card catalog.
I’ve been enchanted with card catalogs since I first set eyes on one in my childhood library, but I have to confess that my fascination has nothing to do with books. Or cataloging. I just really, really like tiny drawers. And the idea of filling lots of tiny drawers. When I go furniture shopping and encounter dressers that have rows of tiny drawers that turn out to be a façade for one large drawer, I get unreasonably angry at said dresser. But library card catalogs are not tricksy in that way. They are full of magic and promise. And the connection to libraries and books is cool, too. I guess. But the tiny drawers!
What do you do with a library card catalog? So many things, my friends. The possibilities are endless.
They make great statement pieces in your home. The statement of course being “I LOVE BOOKS.”
You can use them for displaying small collectibles.
Or plants.
Or to just stash all your wine.
Heck, just turn it into a bookish bar if 641.2 is your favorite section of the library.
They’re very useful in the kitchen.
Or in the bedroom or bathroom for toiletries.
They may not be the most functional pieces for dressers, but you can use them for small articles of clothing and accessories.
Keep track of all of your crafting supplies, no matter your medium!
