Fonseka not asked to suppress Trade Unions: Amaraweera

Support is sought from Regional Development Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka to formulate a mechanism on how to provide essential services without any interruption when trade unions go on strike without prior notice.Other than that it was not an attempt to suppress those unions, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
He also said that several media institutions as well as trade unions had pointed out there was an attempt to suppress trade unions and trade union action.
He added that there has not been a cabinet paper presented before the Cabinet in this regard.
The Minister made this observation yesterday responding to a journalist who asked if Minister Fonseka was to be handed over the control of the trade unions, at a press conference held at the Information Department auditorium.
Minister Amaraweera said that the matter of trade union action staged without prior knowledge was discussed at length at the Cabinet and President Maithripala Sirisena inquired from Minister Fonseka if he would help to formulate a mechanism whereby essential services will be provided without interruption during such situations to which the latter agreed.
“As a Minister Sarath Fonseka would share his expertise,” Minister Amaraweera said “Fonseka is a person of high calibre as he was the Commander that led the forces to defeat terrorism so that we have to make use of him. He will work as a minister and I assure you that there will be no suppression of trade unions and their trade union activities.”
He said for example that if an engineer keeps away from duty, another will be directed to take his place . “Sometimes it could be an engineer in the Forces,” Minister Amaraweera said.
