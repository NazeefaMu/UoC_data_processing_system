Nearly 400 teachers for Sabaragamuwa

The Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council recruited 358 degree and diploma-holders to the Provincial Teaching Service recently.
The new teachers will teach a total of 11 subjects at the Province’s schools.
Appointment letters for these teachers who have obtained degrees or specified two-year diploma courses, were awarded by Sabaragamuwa Province Governor Niluka Ekanayake at the provincial council auditorium recently.
Provincial Education Secretary Mahinda S. Weerasuriya said these teachers will be deployed to teach at schools closest from their houses. It is compulsory for a teacher to work for at least five years at that particular school to which he or she is appointed.
“These teachers have been recruited to end the subject-wise teacher shortage in provincial schools, especially in rural schools.
It is significant that every teacher has been appointed to the closest school from his or her residence. Therefore, these teachers should work for at least five years at the school to which they are appointed,” he said.
Measures have already been taken to absorb 100 more teachers to the provincial teaching service in the near future, he said.
At present, there are 35,000 teachers on duty at around 1,400 schools in the Kegalla and Ratnapura districts of the Sabaragamuwa Province. There are over 400,000 students studying in the province.
