Hambantota Port Agreement runs into another glitch

The Hambantota Port Agreement will face yet another obstacle before being signed as State Minister for Finance Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena yesterday said that the agreement could not be signed without amendments made to the Sri Lanka Ports Authority Act No 51 of 1979.
“If signed without amendments to the Act, the agreement would be illegal”, said Abeywardena.
Addressing a media briefing at the Ministry of Finance, State Minister Abeywardena explained that the Cabinet, consisting of both the UNP and SLFP had thus far agreed on a basic framework which included proposals from the SLFP.
Cabinet on Tuesday also granted approval to set up a cabinet sub-committee chaired by Minister of Special Assignments, Sarath Amunugama to oversee the implementation of the agreement. According to Abeywardena, the committee would look at the various loopholes in the agreement and ensure that it is something that would also keep to the vision and principles of the SLFP. One such loophole they found was that, “Around 700acres of land at the Port have not been valued”.
“We have asked for the Government Valuation Department to value it.” he said.
The SLFP as a party has stated that they would not support privatization of government entities but given the ground realities of the economy, the State Minister of Finance said they were open to public private partnerships.
“The government cannot become auctioneers, we are not Schokman and Samarawickrema”, stressed Abeywardena but added that the government was keen on coming to a common agreement on the Hambantota Port soon, “If we can resolve this issue amicably, the government would have proven to investors that the two parties can work together in government and this would encourage future investments”.
The Hambantota Port Agreement with the Chinese company, China Merchant Port Holdings Company Limited is a joint venture with the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) where 80 percent stake of the Port is to be given to China at USD 1.12 billion. The current framework agreement allows the SLPA to buy back a further 20 percent stake in the venture after 10 years of operation, taking the Sri Lankan stake at the Port to 40 percent.
