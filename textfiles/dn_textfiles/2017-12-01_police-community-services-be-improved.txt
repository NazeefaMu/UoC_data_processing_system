Police community services to be improved

Police community services in the Southern region are to be improved.
According to the Director attached to the Institute for Development of Community Strengths, Matara Condred Ranawake, these programmes are successfully in progress in the Matara district at the moment. The formation of civil security committees at Grama Niladari Division level in the Matara district is already completed. They are to be extended to Galle and Hambantota districts as well.
The police community services will bridge the widening gap between the Police and the civil community in the country. It would also pave the way for the prevention of child abuse, domestic violence against women and also the use of dangerous drugs and liquor. The minimization of minor complaints that are being made to the police by the public and the reduction of the crime rate prevailing in the country are also expected through these programmes, director Ranawake said. The Institute for Development of Community Strengths, Matara organizes and handles all these programmes in the Southern region. The support of the police would also be mobilized for this.
The Asia Foundation and the British High Commission are assisting in this regard, Ranawake added.
