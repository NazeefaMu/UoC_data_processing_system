Royal enter pre-quarters of Under 15 Division two tourney

Royal College Colombo entered the pre quarters of the all island under 15 division two cricket tournament organised by Sri Lanka Schools Cricket Association for the Singer Trophy. Their hopes were shattered when they lost to St. Sebastian's College Moratuwa in the pre quarters.

Out of the eight matches he was able to take part in seven matches and in the morning of the pre quarter match his leg was injured and he could not take part which was a heavy blow to Royalists. He captured 27 wickets and his best figures was 5 for 44 against Ananda College Colombo and gave away 235 runs.
