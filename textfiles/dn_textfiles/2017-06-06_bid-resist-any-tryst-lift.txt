Bid to resist any tryst with a lift!

I hate lifts. I know they are a convenient source of mobility when you consider the ups and downs of their use in high rises. And particularly so when they save you a heck of lot of thigh ache while ascending mountainous stairways.
But I have a considerable phobia of them. I always look around before I enter one. Are there stairs? I have encountered a few high-rise buildings in my time that had constrained me to take the lift because the stairs were alarmed fire exits!
You see, I am claustrophobic. And I am terrified for a number of reasons of stepping into an air-tight metal box the size of a luxury toilet cubicle, which is devoid of a loo when you become stuck and incontinent with stark fright and lose control of your bladder.
And so would any rational person when you realise you are pulled hundreds of feet from the ground by a cable, which if it snapped and the brakes failed would send you plummeting to your death, even if you jumped just as the darned contraption hit the ground.
You may imagine my fears are irrational. But ask a thousand others who share my anxiety about a lift going kaput and you will be assailed by the same petrifying expressions of dread. For any unimaginative moron calling a lift is run-of-the-mill stuff. It’s easy. Simply press the button and wait. And once inside then press the button again.
But experience has taught me that all lifts are not what one would call equal. For instance, I once edited a story for a Hong Kong newspaper of a woman who stepped into an old defective lift, or rather a lift that was not, without keeping her eyes peeled. The light indicated it was on her floor, the doors opened and she stepped into fourth floor space. The poor woman was injured but fortunately survived the involuntary plunge only because the device had stopped on the floor directly below.
As in the case of many others I am always impatient while waiting for a lift. I am a firm believer that many lifts work on the pressure you exert on the call button. So punching it a 100 times will make it arrive a lot faster. Before you get into the lift, it’s as well to check whether it has actually arrived or going up or down. There’s nothing more embarrassing than saying confidently to a packed lift “Ground floor please” and then feeling the lift rocketing upwards.
In addition to my phobia I must concede that lift faux pas can also be terribly embarrassing. I once worked on the fifth floor of a 24-floor office building in Singapore for a publishing company. It was my second week at work and I was going home at the end of a long day. And instead of looking at the light to confirm that the lift was actually headed in a downward direction, I just got on as soon as the doors opened, assuming it was going down.
Naturally, I was wrong. I rode up to the sixth floor. When the doors opened, the president of the company was standing there, waiting to get on. I recognised the crusty old tyrant from his picture in a previous issue of the firm’s business magazine.
I was so surprised that I didn’t even have the presence of mind to jump out as though I had actually intended to get off on the executive floor. I just stood there like a nitwit. And as the doors closed and we rode down, he said to me: “Are you just joy riding on the lift, or what?”
To which I replied, inaudibly, “Uh, unintentionally, yes,” sounding remarkably like Butthead, when he’s trying to figure something out. The president said nothing. He looked like he wondered who I was and if there was any way he could conveniently fire me. Fortunately, he never found out who I was.
I was once late for an appointment and hurried up an escalator, which we all know is a vertical transportation device in the form of a moving staircase – a conveyor which carries people between floors of a building. It consisted of a motor-driven chain of individually linked steps to reach the lift of a high rise.
I dashed up the moving steps to the annoyance of several passengers serenely riding the stairway on its uppity-uppity ascent. The planets were aligned, as long as I kept my footing I would arrive at my appointment on time. I tore up the moving stairwell uncommonly nimble given my various physical inadequacies, flung myself up the stairs two steps at a time, and reached the lift. I was the only person there. I hit the lift call button. Then I hit it again. And a third time just in case. The lift descended and the doors opened. I stepped inside, triumphant, and hit the up button. I faced the doors and watched them close slowly, the merest sliver of a chink of light showing through.
Then the doors opened again. It was a man, who had clearly been, if not hot, lukewarm on my heels. He had stopped me. I still hate him now. Never mind, I thought. I stabbed the up button again. But somebody shouted, “Hang on!” Another middle-aged man dashed through the closing doors and hit the open doors button. He stuck his head through and called, “It’s all right, Mum, I’ve got it.”
I knew which way this was going. By the time the fat mum of this middle-aged moron had appeared at the lift’s threshold, another horde of humanity was at the door. And in they poured, dozens of people, 20 or so of them together in some sort of work outing. I assume it was a convention outing - they were all wearing name badges and it did not look like a hen party, although it sounded like one.
Finally the doors closed. And we waited. And waited. Two minutes passed and the doors did not reopen. “Brilliant,” I thought, “We’re trapped.” I surveyed the throng and tried to work out who we would eat first. Any more of the chatter and I would have volunteered myself.
“Has anybody pressed the open doors button?” I asked, from under a stranger’s armpit. “Oooh,” said somebody, who presumably pressed the button. The doors opened. We were still on the ground floor. There were twenty-eight people in that lift, and not one of them had thought to press the up button.
“Scuse me,” I said. “This is my floor.” And I pushed through the crowd back into the lobby. Sometimes you just have to be late for an appointment, I thought, as I waited for the next lift.
