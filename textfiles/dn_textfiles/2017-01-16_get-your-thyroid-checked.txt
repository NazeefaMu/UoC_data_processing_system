Get your Thyroid checked!

Today Consultant Oncologist attached to National Cancer Institute,Maharagama,Dr.Prasad Abeysinghe speaks about Thyroid Cancer. Recent Sri Lanka Cancer Incidence Data shows that it is the third commonest cancer among females.
Q: What is Thyroid Cancer ?
A - The thyroid gland is situated below the Adam’s apple in the front part of the neck. Thyroid Cancer starts when cells in the thyroid begin to grow out of control.
Dr. Prasad Abeysinghe
It has two main types of cells called Follicular cells and C cells.
Follicular cells use iodine from the blood to make thyroid hormones, which help regulate a body metabolism. C cells make calcitonin, a hormone that helps control how the body uses calcium.
Different cancers develop from each kind of cell. Most thyroid cancers develop from thyroid follicular cells. They are called differentiated cancers as these cancers look a lot like normal thyroid tissue when seen with a microscope. There are two types called Papillary and follicular.
About eight out of ten thyroid cancers are papillary cancers. Follicular is the next most common type, making up about one out of ten thyroid cancers.
Rest of the thyroid cancers consists of medullary thyroid cancer which develops from the C cells and Anaplastic cancers which are undifferentiated because the cancer cells do not look very much like normal thyroid cells under the microscope. Anaplastic cancer is a rare form of thyroid cancer that spreads quickly into the neck and to other parts of the body, and is very hard to treat.
Q: Who are the most affected ?
A - Thyroid cancer is commonly diagnosed at a younger age than most other adult cancers. Nearly three out of four cases are found in women, About two percent of thyroid cancers occur in children and teens.
Several inherited conditions have been linked to different types of thyroid cancer such as medullary thyroid carcinomas. Still, most people who develop thyroid cancer do not have an inherited condition or a family history of the disease.
Sri Lanka Cancer Incidence Data in 2009 showed that there were 816 woman and 180 males diagnosed of Thyroid cancer. It is the third commonest cancer among females. Among females aged between 15-34 years, thyroid cancer is the commonest cancer with nearly 40 percent of total number of cancers.
Most early thyroid cancers are found when patients see their doctors because of neck lumps or nodules they noticed. They are also sometimes found when people have ultrasound tests for other health problems.
Q: How do doctors diagnose it ?
A -First step is medical history and physical exam where the doctor will pay special attention to the size and firmness of thyroid and any enlarged lymph nodes in neck.
Next other tests, such as blood tests, ultrasound exam and Nuclear medicine scans are done to get a better sense of whether thyroid gland might have a cancer.
The actual diagnosis of thyroid cancer is made with a Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy where the doctor will place a thin, hollow needle
directly into the nodule to take out some cells into a syringe and looked at under a microscope.
The chance of being diagnosed with thyroid cancer has risen in recent years. Much of this rise appears to be the result of the increased use of thyroid ultrasound, which can detect small thyroid nodules that might not
otherwise have been found in the past.
Q: What are the treatments available ?
A -Most thyroid cancers can be cured. Depending on the type and stage of the thyroid cancer, more than one type of treatment such as surgery and radiation may be necessary.
Total removal of the thyroid gland along with the cancer is the mainstay of treatment for most of thyroid cancers. Sometimes the lymph glands around the thyroid gland is also removed.
Temporary voice change, low levels of calcium are Potential Side Effects following surgery. All patients require replacement of thyroxin hormone as an oral tablet post-surgery. In differentiated thyroid cancer the dose of thyroxin given is higher than the replacement dose to help stop any remaining cancer cells from growing.
In differentiated thyroid cancer, Patients may receive radioactive iodine,in the form of either one or more capsules, some weeks after surgery to eliminate any remaining papillary or follicular thyroid cancer cells or normal thyroid tissue that the surgeon could not remove. Radioactive iodine also aims to eliminate any thyroid cancer cells that may have spread to other parts of the body.
Eliminating the remnant of normal thyroid tissue will make it easier to do the ongoing monitoring for any possible recurrence of cancer. Radioactive iodine ablation has also been shown to improve survival rates if the cancer has spread to the neck or other parts of the body.
Not all thyroid differentiated thyroid cancers need same dose of radioactive Iodine. Very small thyroid cancer does not require radioactive iodine at all. Smaller low risk thyroid cancer patients require a small dose of radioactive iodine which could be administered as an outpatient procedure. According to the newer guidelines for radioactive treatment,majority of thyroid cancers can be treated with small dose of radioactive iodine which could be administered as an outpatient at a lower cost and minimal discomfort and after effects of radioactive to Iodine the patient.
Larger and more advanced cancers which are considered as high risk are given a higher dose of radioactive Iodine and separated in isolation for few days to eliminate the possibility of radiation exposure to others.
A burning sensation or tenderness in the neck area, nausea and upset stomach, swelling and tenderness of the salivary glands, dry mouth,reduction in tear production are the potential side effects of radioactive iodine treatment (More likely for higher doses)
Cancers which has invaded the surrounding neck tissues are sometimes treated with external beam radiation as well to reduce the possibility of recurrence.
Q: How can Thyroid Cancer be prevented ?
A - A diet low in iodine may increase the risk of thyroid cancer. Radiation exposure to the neck area especially in childhood is a proven risk factor for thyroid cancer. Sources of such radiation include certain medical treatments and radiation fallout from power plant accidents or nuclear weapons. Therefore avoid neck radiation and take enough iodine in diet such as iodinated salt can reduce the risk of thyroid cancers.
