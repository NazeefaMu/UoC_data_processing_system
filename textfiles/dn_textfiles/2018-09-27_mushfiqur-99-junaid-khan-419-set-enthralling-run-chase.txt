Mushfiqur (99), Junaid Khan (4/19) set up enthralling run chase

ABU DHABI, Wednesday: A brilliant spell of left-arm fast bowling by Junaid Khan coupled with an equally brilliant innings of 99 from Mushfiqur Rahim left the final Asia Cup Super Four contest between Pakistan and Bangladesh nicely poised for a tight finish at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium here on Wednesday.
The winner of this match will play India in the final at Dubai on Friday.
Junaid who was playing his first Asia Cup match of the current tournament showed what Pakistan had missed when he ripped through the Bangladesh top order with two early wickets to have them limping at 12 for 3 and then returned at the death to pick up a further two more wickets to finish with magnificent figures of 4 for 19 off 9 overs as Bangladesh were bowled out for 239 off 48.5 overs.
In fact Junaid replaced Mohammad Amir who has shown poor form in the tournament so far.
Bangladesh recovered from their early loss largely through a fighting fourth wicket partnership between Mushfiqur and Mohammed Mithun who blunted the Pakistani bowling which had their tails up after the early successes to put on 144 runs.
Mushfiqur once again showed what a big game player he was batting according to the situation to rescue his team. He battled through cramps on his right leg to score a brilliant 99 off 116 balls with nine fours before edging a catch behind the wicket to Sarfraz off Shaheen Afridi one short of a deserving hundred.
Mithun who proved an ideal foil to Mushfiqur made 60 out of 84 balls (6 fours) before Hasan Ali provided the breakthrough for Pakistan by having him hit back a tame return catch.
Bangladesh’s innings went into decline once the stand was broken and they lost their last seven wickets for 83 runs as Junaid and Ali produced some excellent death bowling.
Bangladesh went into this crucial match without their most experienced allrounder Shakib Al Hasan who was ruled out with a fractured finger.
