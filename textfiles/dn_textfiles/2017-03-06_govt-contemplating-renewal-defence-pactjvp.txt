Govt. contemplating renewal of Defence pact:JVP

Political higher-ups of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) yesterday, charged that the government was deliberating the renewing a the defence pact which was signed secretively between Sri Lanka and the US ten years ago under the previous regime.
“The pact,” JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva said, “is highly disadvantageous to Sri Lanka. It was signed throwing dust in the eyes of everyone, even the Cabinet.”
“It was clandestinely entered into. Then the Permanent Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa signed it secretively with the then US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Robert O Blake,” Silva said.
He was speaking at a press conference held at the JVP Headquarters in Pelawatta, Battaramulla.
“The expiration of the term of the pact, “Acquisition and Cross-Services Agreement” (ACSA) ended yesterday, March 5, 2017,” Silva said. The Agreement says that it could be extended for a further ten year period by mutual consent of the two governments.
“We learnt that the government had already held many discussions with a focus to giving its consent to the Agreement’s continuation,” he said.
“We have reasons to believe that the present government too would follow the example of the previous regime and give its consent for the continuation of this Agreement secretly,” he stated.
“We seriously ask the government to stay away from this defence pact which was signed under the previous government without the approval of Parliament. It holds no advantage for the country. Nevertheless, it will bring harmful consequences to the country in the course of time,” he said.
“According to the Agreement, both countries are bound to provide facilities such as logistics, land, fuel and other facilities to defence personnel, aircraft and vessels,” he said.
“Sri Lanka is unlikely to engage in wars, but the US is. Hence the Agreement has no impact in terms of Sri Lanka’s disposition. Should the US engage in a military mission in the region, we are bound to provide the US with land, fuelling, ammunition and other hardware,” he explained.
“We vehemently opposed this Agreement which was signed during the time of the previous government, because of its seriousness in terms of possibilities that could engender regional discord. We also raised suspicions as it was signed between two US citizens, on account that Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa is a US citizen,” he said.
He also drew attention that the US had already established a military base in Diego Garcia in the Central Indian Ocean stating in case should the US wages a war against – say India or China for that matter, Sri Lanka should provide facilities to the US in support of their mission.
Silva also requested the Defence Ministry to declare their stand on the matter.
