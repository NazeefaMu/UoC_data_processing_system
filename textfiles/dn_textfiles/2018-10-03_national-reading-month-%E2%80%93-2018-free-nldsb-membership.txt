The month of October has been declared as the National Reading Month by the National Library and Documentation Services Board (NLDSB).
In relation to this, the NLDSB has decided to offer one-year free membership of the National Library to Sri Lankan readers during the National Reading Month in October 2018. Many university academics, researchers, journalists, university students and many more make use of this opportunity.
You can make use of the offer only by visiting the National Library during the opening hours during October 2018. Application forms can be obtained from the main counter of the Reader Services Division. All Sri Lankans irrespective of any limitations are eligible for membership. This could be a good opportunity for academics, researchers, university students, journalists and general information seekers to obtain one- year free membership.
