A healing touch for lasting wellness

Inspired by the power of essential oils as a form of natural healing, and alternative therapies helping people stay well in every aspect of life continues to drive the Kemara ethos.
Established nearly two decades ago to enhance lives through holistic wellness, Kemara’s founder Kishani Gunawardena’s deep-seated dedication to promote health and well-being continues to manifest. Kishani says. “Wellness has become an integral part of lifestyle; Kemara goes beyond the ordinary, ensuring positive and lasting benefits using everything natural.”
Successfully promoting the powerful benefits, aromatic qualities and tropical applications of essential oils, Kemara’s essential oil range is based on a comprehensive wellness philosophy. “We use essential oils for a wide range of emotional and physical wellness applications. They can be used as single essential oils or in complex blends depending on the desired benefit,” she noted.
Emphasising the ‘choice of oils is important as it can vary for each person’, Kishani explained, “The choice of oils for stress, fatigue, work related issues would be oil of basil, rosemary, lavender and bergamot. Apart from helping you to relax these oils help you to focus and enables clarity.”
“For depression we use frankincense oil, which has amazing anti-depressing properties helping to deeply calm the person and open up the lungs. For an uplifting aroma, citrus orange and mandarin oils are ideal. For anxiety, oils such as ylang ylang and sandalwood are suitable. Apart from emotional wellbeing we also use oils for physical ailments such as a cough and cold where oils help decongestion,” she added.
A common thread that echoes in all Kemara’s therapies is to inculcate holistic wellness in mind, body, and spirit. Thus, Kemara’s Wellness Center is positioned as a destination that inspires healthy lifestyles. “When a client comes in, even though we have a menu, we never do a treatment without a consultation – we take into account their diet, exercise programme and day to day activities which gives us an idea of their lifestyle,” Kishani noted.
“While consumers today are better-educated and more aware, many still think a spa is a luxury. But I want people to understand that holistic therapies have amazing powers and their highest purpose is the prevention of illness rather than treating symptoms. Please don’t wait till you fall ill,” she added.
