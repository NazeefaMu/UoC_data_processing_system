Tough broads

When a female politician’s worst crime is to be unlikeable and uncompassionate, how much ration­ality and coldness is acceptable for women intel­lectuals and artists? Just how tough is tough enough? Deborah Nelson, a professor of English at the University of Chicago, con­siders the politics, psychology and philosophy of toughness in her study of six modern women: Simone Weil, Hannah Arendt, Mary McCarthy, Susan Sontag, Diane Arbus and Joan Didion. Nelson originally titled her book “Tough Broads”; it would be more idiomatic to call them “Tough Cookies”.
But neither of these admiring monikers for the fast-talking dames in 1930s screwball comedy would suit the austere, aloof, serious, resolutely (if self-deludingly) unglamorous heroines of her book, and they would surely have been insulted to be linked with Katharine Hepburn, or even labelled as women at all.
These writers, intellectuals and artists insisted on the aesthetic, political and moral obligation to face the painful reality of the twentieth century head-on. Their toughness was a premeditated “lifelong project . . . worked out with a great deal of self-consciousness”. But they all faced anger and hostility for their insistence on confronting suffering and pain without emotion.
Their tone of unemotional clarity on the most traumatic events of their time made them respected and feared; but crossing the fine line between detachment and heartlessness also made them seem “out of step with their times”. On some subjects – the Holocaust, the Eichmann trials, civil rights, Vietnam, 9/11 – their detached refusal of empathy and solidarity shocked even their close friends and allies.
Psychologically cold
Nelson calls their hyper-rational stance “unsentimental”, implicitly equating emotion with sentimentality, a much-derided genre of female writing in nineteenth-century America, which has been defended by feminist literary historians as a style “with its own aesthetic practices”. Unlike sentimentality, however, unsentimentality has no literary history; and when women practise it, they can be judged for personal failures of feeling, rather than philosophical rigour.
Thus these six women “have been perceived as psychologically cold rather than engaged in an ethical project with different assumptions”.
Nelson defends them against such charges. She argues that unsentimentality is a strategic ethical choice, not a by-product of personality or a flaw in femininity. These women had to renew, rethink and revise their choices to be unsentimental all the time.
They accepted the necessity of causing pain to readers in order to force them to look at the hard facts, but they were not personally cruel, perverse, unfeeling. Although there were connections between them – McCarthy and Arendt were friends, McCarthy translated Weil, Sontag wrote influential essays about Weil and Arbus – they were not a group or a school. Nelson suggests that they are “affiliated more closely by style and shared sensibility than they are by biography”.
Indeed, their main affinity may have been their mutual distaste for collectivity, especially in the form of feminism. Their contempt for the sisterly, affectionate, collective and utopian aspects of the feminist movements of their day underlined their individualism and illustrated their resistance to palliative and optimistic visions of all kinds. Nelson does not emphasize gender in her analysis, but obviously gender is central because it is unusual for women to choose a tough public voice and style. As Didion noted in an essay of 1976, on Georgia O’Keeffe, “‘Hardness’ has not been in our century a quality much admired in women”.
Determined careerist
Susan Sontag: The making of an icon, for example, is a “revised and updated” edition of a controversial unauthorized biography by Carl Rollyson and Lisa Paddock (Rollyson’s wife and collabor­ator) which revealed Sontag’s lesbian love affairs, skewered her as a determined careerist, and emphasized the strategies of her publisher Roger Straus and agent Andrew Wylie in making her famous.
The backstory of the biography is fascinating in itself. The author of twelve biographies of figures from Marilyn Monroe to Michael Foot, Rollyson devotes a chapter of his Confessions of a Serial Biographer (2016) to a detailed and furious account of the way Sontag’s entourage, in his view, systematically blocked his access to information, defamed his reputation, and influenced reviewers to attack his conclusions. In their preface to the new edition, the authors are still angry with Sontag and her entourage.
But their first version ended before Sontag’s diagnosis with myelodysplastic syndrome, and her protracted and painful death, in 2004. Now, with access to Sontag’s letters and diaries, both published and in her archive at UCLA, the authors declare “we are in a position to enhance the texture of our narrative, adding a sense of immediacy”.
Amazon queen
They also add a sense of com­passion and admiration. While Benjamin Moser’s authorized biography-in-progress should eventually give the fullest picture of Sontag’s development, Rollyson and Paddock’s determined research, especially the interviews they conducted with more than a hundred men and women who knew Sontag, many of whom have since died, make this book a valuable resource. It is not a sympathetic biography, but it is serious and informed, seeing her as a grandly self-created artist. And what a portrait of the artist as a woman! Sontag reinvented herself numerous times, and repeatedly “forged her view of herself as an intellectual and dissident”. Her life story complicates and questions her public image as an indomitable, scornful Amazon queen, immune to human passions and needs; and it challenges her iconic toughness.
According to her son, editor and executor David Rieff, Sontag’s intimate and emotional journals of love affairs, self-doubt, vanity, tenderness, intellectual curiosity and insatiable zest for living, constitute the “great autobiographical novel she never cared to write”. Even Sontag could not always be tough enough to meet her own severe expectations, but the letters and journals may turn out to be her most enduring legacy.
