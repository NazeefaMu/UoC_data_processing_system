Education a weapon against poverty: Faiszer

Provincial Councils, Local Government and Sports Minister Faiszer Musthapha, addressing a programme held at the Sports Ministry's Duncan White Auditorium, said one of the main reasons for him to enter into politics, was to provide strength and guidance through education to underprivileged children in both cities and villages.
The event was organised in order to award scholarships to poor children through the Ape Daruwo scholarship scheme in honour of his 49th birthday which fell yesterday.
One-hundred and five children who had successfully completed their G. C. E. Ordinary Level Examination were awarded scholarships through the scheme which falls under the Faiszer Musthapha Foundation.
Minister Musthapha, addressing the children and parents, said, "My father succeeded in providing me with a sound education. However, my grandfather was a poor child from a rural village in Madawala. He used to say that he walked about seven miles to school on a daily basis and studied with great difficulty."
"In that era, it was a challenge for rural youth to practice as Attorneys-at-Lawyer at Kandy courts. However, my grandfather succeeded in becoming one of the most outstanding lawyers in the Kandy courts," he added.
The Minister said, "Today, two generations are enlightened because of my grandfather's decision. That is why I want to share something with you children. Education is the only weapon against poverty. Unfortunately, your parents think that they cannot move forward due to poverty. We can conquer the world through education."
"We are ready to give you a hand. I have great expectations to bring about change through politics. We provided scholarships through Ape Daruwo to 55 children and 45 of them had been qualified to enter into universities. We must give our children the opportunity as our children are capable," he said.
Former Sri Lankan Cricketer Roshan Mahanama also participated in the event and presented studens with certificates.
