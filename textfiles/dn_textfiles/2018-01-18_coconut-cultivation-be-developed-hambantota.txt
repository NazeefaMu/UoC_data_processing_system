Coconut cultivation to be developed in Hambantota

Seventy five acres in Hambantota will be brought under coconut cultivation before the end of the year in order to give a boost to the coconut cultivation in the district, a spokesman for the Coconut Cultivation Board Hambantota branch said.
He said that a large extent of coconut cultivation was destroyed in the district as a result of a disease that spread among the coconut cultivation.
