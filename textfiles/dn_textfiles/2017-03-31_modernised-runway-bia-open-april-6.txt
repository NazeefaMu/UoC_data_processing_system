Modernised runway at BIA to open on April 6

The rehabilitated and modernised runway of the Katunayake, Bandaranaike International Airport will be re-opened on April 6, Transport and Civil Aviation Deputy Minister Ashok Abeysinghe said.
Addressing a press conference in Kurunegala yesterday, the Deputy Minister said, the runway, built in 1986, had not undergone any repairs for over three decades and the International Air Transport Association had warned that the Katunayake Airport would be de-listed from 2017 if the dilapidated runway was not modernised. The Government which paid attention to this warning took steps to modernize the runway. The work launched on January 5 had now been almost completed and the runway ,which could accommodate large aircraft like A380s, would be operative round the clock after April 6.
