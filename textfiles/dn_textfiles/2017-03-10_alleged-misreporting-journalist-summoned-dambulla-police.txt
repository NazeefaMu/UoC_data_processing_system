Alleged misreporting  Journalist summoned  to Dambulla Police

Journalist Kanchana Kumara Ariyadasa was summoned to Dambulla Police yesterday to record a statement from him with regard to a complaint made against him by a doctor attached to Dambulla Hospital.
The doctor said that Ariyadasa had leveled allegations that birth control methods were introduced on mothers by force at the hospital. The doctor named Rajitha said in his complaint that the journalist had acted in contravention of media ethics and hospital rules by taking video pictures of hospital wards and patients and published the pictures in the media causing disgrace to him.
Kanchana Ariyadasa who visited the Police station in response to the summons by HQI Inspector Sampath Wickremaratne stated in his statement that acting on information about alleged wrongdoings at the Dambulla hospital he published the story with video pictures received from the people.
He published the story after checking the accuracy. He requested the Police to conduct an investigation into the matter without witch-hunting the media. However, the doctor who had made the complaint was not present at the Police station.
