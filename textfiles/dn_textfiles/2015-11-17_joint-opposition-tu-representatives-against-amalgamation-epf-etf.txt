Joint Opposition, TU representatives against amalgamation of EPF, ETF

The Joint Opposition and Trade Union representatives would stand against the amalgamation of the EPF and ETF to create a new national pension fund, said Lanka Sama Samaja Party Leader Prof. Tissa Vitharana.
This was revealed at a press conference held at the Dr.N.M. Perera Centre in Colombo 8.
Prof: Vitharana said that it was a risk to take the RPF and ETF out of the Central Bank which was a right won by the working class after the 1956 change.
Opposition Member of Parliament Vasudeva Nanayakkara said that the Prime Minister who made interesting pledges before the election are moving bitter proposals after the election.
Opposition MP Bandula Gunawardena said this massive fund is taken out of the Central Bank on instructions of the McKinsey Institute in America. He added that the working class should understand the risk before them if this proposal is implemented.
