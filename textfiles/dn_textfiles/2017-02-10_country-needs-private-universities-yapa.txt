Country needs private universities: Yapa

It is the responsibility of every politician to find a solution to the SAITM issue as it has been turned out to be one of the main problems in the country, Finance State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena.
Addressing the media at the Finance Ministry yesterday, Minister Abeywardena said the country is in need of more doctors and added that private universities have to be accepted and necessary measures should be taken to solve the problems related to their standards.
“Only 25,000 students enter university every year and there are eight medical faculties. According to the Z- score, sometimes a student who gets 3As in the Advance Level from Colombo will not get a chance but a student with 2 Bs and a C from Moneragala might enter the university according to the present university intake system,” he said.
Abeywardena said out of the 1,400 medical doctors who pass out every year, 1,200 are from state universities and 200 from foreign universities.
"However, the country needs to produce more than 2,000 doctors each year. Private universities are accepted worldwide and why should we refuse it without any grounds?” he questioned.
Sri Lankan students go to foreign universities to obtain medical degrees. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa gave 10 scholarships worth Rs. 70 million as he accepted SAITM as a Medical College. This is not an issue that should be taken to roads by politicians. It is the responsibility of politicians to find a solution, he added.
Minister Abeywardena pointed out that the ones who are against private medical universities talk about the standards of it but fail to talk about the standards of the state universities.
“The SLMC should allow SAITM students to write the Act 16 exam or find out a proper solution,” he said.
