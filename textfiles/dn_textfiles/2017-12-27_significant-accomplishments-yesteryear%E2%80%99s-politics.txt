Significant accomplishments of yesteryear’s politics

“In our age there is no such thing as 'keeping out of politics.' All issues are political issues, and politics itself is a mass of lies, evasions, folly, hatred and schizophrenia”. - George Orwell
None of the present class of politicians measure up to these historical greats. The lack of quality in our political top tier is mysterious and apparently outside natural law. -But why can’t we have gentleman politicians? Why can’t we have another Senanayake, Bandaranaike, NM Perera, Keunamen, Kadirgarmar or a TB Jayah? The unity regime is incapable of moving forward as a unit. Corruption free governance, political reforms through a new constitution, reconciliation, minority rights are put on hold. Apart from minor gains here and there, the government has not achieved any significant accomplishments, but significant erosion of its popular support base. With increasing public disappointment, political survival of the unity at local government elections is expected to be at severe risk.
Looking nostalgically back almost little over a generation, I reminisce life of three LSSP politicians, in the period from late 1940s up to early 70s. All three of them belonged to either middle-class or lower middle-class; they were men of principles and high integrity, they never betrayed the trust placed by their supporters. Disproving George Orwell, they engaged in politics sans ‘lies, evasions, folly, hatred and schizophrenia’. They won elections without spending a cent; did not accumulate wealth and finally retired, back home with no pensions and penniless.
Moratuwa’s Merrill Fernando
In early 1960s, I was travelling from Panadura to attend an A/L class in Dehiwala. A lean fair neatly dressed gentleman in white shirt and red tie, and a white drill coat hanging on his left arm entered the CTB double-decker bus that I was travelling in. A passenger recognized him and offered a seat, “Wadivenna, Merrile Sahodaraya” [Comrade Merrile, take a seat]. Merrile Fernando, from the fishing coastal village of Koralawella, was one of the leading rebellious fighters of 1953 Hartal. He won 1960 March and July elections under LSSP defeating business magnate of Moratuwa, Ruskin Fernando of Velona fame. The writer, while returning from work in 1967 met a somewhat familiar person who travelled with him in the same compartment.
I failed to recognize him until he got off at Koralawella Station, to be greeted by two fisher folk women, ‘Merrill apita, Api Merrilta — [we are for Merrill and Merrill is for us]; there was no scarcity for slogans. Merrille, the ideologist broke away along with other revolutionists on principles when the LSSP leadership aligned with ‘Capitalist Sirimavo’, in 1964; hence he lost Moratuwa seat to his former colleague Wimalasiri de Mel [LSSP] in 1965.
Henry Peiris of Panadura
MP for Panadura, Henry Peiris, [1947-1952], travelled within his constituency using the only precious vehicle he possessed, a push bicycle during 1947 campaign. As the MP he used to attened Parliament by public transport [South Western Company’s Road Bus, as there was no CTB then].
Comrade Henry Pieris MP was the father of veteran media man, the late Janadasa Pieris. At the parliamentary elections held in 1947, he defeated the Deputy Speaker in the State Council, Sir Susantha de Fonseka, who contested on UNP ticket. Sir Susantha came from one of Panadura’s affluent property owning families.
He used to tour his constituency [a large area covering part of present Bandaragama and Kesbewa], on horseback, with his chauffer driven limousine following. The tuk… tuk.. noise from horse shoes wakes us; and we would rush to the garden as did all children [I was four years then] in the neighbourhood.
There were no party symbols then: Flags and posters were not a violation of law. Quite often, ‘Henry Sahodaraya’, accompanied by a few of his supporters would drop in to discuss campaign strategies with party men in the area.
He would park his ‘Limousine’, a Humber push bicycle under a shade, and take out some notices or book-lets from the cane basket, discuss ideological as well as general politics with a few people for half an hour or so.
Wishing good bye with one of the famous, now obsolete, party slogans, ‘Nirdhana Pantiyata Jayaweva- Dhanpathi Bhangaweva’ [Victory to the Proletariat- Down with the Capitalists]. Here the term ‘Capitalists’ is erroneously translated by the English educated Marxist leaders, as ‘dhanapathi’, instead of ‘Dhanawaadin’, further distancing the businessmen from the movement. Comrade Henry rode for his next destination.
Lesley Goonewardene, a son of famous General Practitioner in Panadura was a leader of LSSP, and an equally wealthy man as Sir Susantha. He lost to Susantha de Fonseka in 1936, forcing him to abandon his home seat in search of greener pastures in Colombo North, another strong hold of Marxists.
The LSSP in Panadura were left with no options, but consider our ‘Push cycle-Comrade’ and editor of party’s news bulletin, as the best alternative to fill the void created by Lesley. Comrade Henry, contesting under Dr Colvin R de Silva’s break-away group named Bolshevik-Leninist Party, not only he had the courage to take up the challenge, but stunned the Electorate by defeating the giant who was backed by all the Panadura’s supra class land-owners who lavishly threw their weight behind their man.
‘Mal Sahodaraya’ of Colepetty
It was in early 1970s that I came to know the third LSSPer who lived down Muhandiram Lane, Colepetty, among the labour community in one of those shanty ‘Waththes’.
He was one time City Father representing Colepetty ward at Colombo’s Municipality, [it was in 1950s or 60s, I guess].
The Colepetty Ward included the posh Cinnamon Gardens, Colombo 7. D S Mallawaarachchi, ‘Mal Sahodaraya’ to the downtrodden people who exceeded the City’s elite going by numbers, ran his small office as Secretary to a Private sector minor employees trade Union affiliated to LSSP—During this time I was attached to Shaw Wallace and Hedges, the European managed multinational, where most of the labor were members of Mal’s Union.
One day Bandayiya, a manual labourer in our stores, who belonged to another union went to Mal seeking his help to get a letter drafted, [he had no confidence in his union men], the letter was in response to a dispute he had with the management. After listening to his story, ‘Mal’ typed the letter in duplicate and got our man to sign it spending almost two hours on the job. Bandayiya, who was reluctant to just say thank you, attempted to palm a five rupee note on D S Mallawaaarachchi. [Banda’s day’s wages]
Responding harshly, the scantily dressed staunch Trotskyite who lived in a temporary plank-walled hut, threw the money away screaming,
“I say, give that letter here…, if you have money, better go and hire a lawyer and get it done.” Bandayiya, back at work with the letter was cautioned by his colleagues who knew Mallawarachchi well. One of them later told me, “Sir, whenever he appear before Labor Tribunal in a case, and being invited to have lunch with us; his usual response was, ‘No, If you like buy me a toffee’, and as we already had the five-cent toffee ready for him, he would walk up to the bus stop adjusting his badly worn out pair of rubber slippers, wishing us,
‘Sahodaryange Aragalayata Jayaweva” [victory to your struggle].
Remembering those politicians often brings a meaningful smile on my lips; and a painful throb in my chest.
