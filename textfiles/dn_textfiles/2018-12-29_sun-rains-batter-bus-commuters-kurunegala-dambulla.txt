Sun, rains batter bus commuters in Kurunegala, Dambulla

The bus stands which were removed while the Kurunegala-Dabulla Main Road was constructed have not been reinstalled to date. Now hundreds of commuters are waiting for buses beside roads under scorching sun rays and rains.
Over 14 bus stands were along the road earlier and private companies had erected many of them. Several had been built in memory of war heroes and loved ones.
Wayamba Road Passenger Transport Authority Chairman Desan Sampath Warnapura said the National Transport Commission will be informed about the issue.
