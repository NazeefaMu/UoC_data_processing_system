Parliament

 JO politically bankrupt: PM
Joint Opposition members are bankrupt politically even without the support of the First SLFP woman President and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday.
He made this observation when sittings of Parliament resumed for a second time after the agitation created by the Joint Opposition members demanding a vote on the Provincial Council Elections (Amendment) Bill.
The Premier stated that he met with representatives of the SLMC and the Upcountry People’s Front and listened to their grievances. “The government was ready to accommodate the grievances of minority and minor parties,” he said. “If any faction of a minority or the majority is affected by this Bill to be passed, the government is ready to make amendments to it.”
He added that the government would guarantee the representation of the women too.
“The Joint Opposition members are in trouble now,” the Premier said. “The first and only woman President elected from the SLFP is with us now. Even Mahinda Rajapaksa is not in the House.”
He stated that it was the UNP who contested with the Bandaranaikes and not those of the Joint Opposition.
Statement calling for exercise of universal jurisdiction on SL:
FM says will make statement within three weeks
Foreign Affairs Minister Thilak Marapana stated that he would make a statement in Parliament on the statement made by UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Prince Al Hussien in which he called for the exercise of universal jurisdiction on Sri Lanka, in three weeks time.
He made this observation in response to special statement made by Joint Opposition Member Dinesh Gunawardena under Standing Order 23(2) charging that UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Prince Al Hussien had made an effort to interfere in Sri Lanka’s internal affairs through his recent statement where he called for the exercise of universal jurisdiction on Sri Lanka.
Minister Marapana said that there was not much to worry about as charged by the Joint Opposition member Dinesh Gunawardena on the statement made by Prince Hussein. The Minister also said that he was fully aware of the incident and would make a statement in Parliament after a study. Dinesh Gunawardene inquired as to what action the government intends to take against the UN Commissioner of Human Rights?
Minister of Foreign Affairs Tilak Marapana responding, said he would make a statement in three weeks time.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya then advised the minister to answer the question without taking too much time.
Minister Lakshman Kiriella said that that the statement was not so serious and it was only an incident that had taken place four years ago. He added that nothing much had happened during the good governance period.
Increasing of women representation:
Salient feature in Bill pledged by President in election manifesto: Mustapha
Increasing women’s representation has been a salient feature in this Bill as pledged by President Maithripala Sirisena in his election manifesto, said Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Mustapha in Parliament yesterday.
As regards to women’s representation in this country, there has been continuous agitation that unless you come from a political background you don’t have the opportunity to get into Parliament.
Therefore, the President thought it just to introduce a system whereby women could enter all organs of government, said Minister Mustapha.
“With regard to Local Government elections, we brought in a mechanism where 25% of the members would be women with regard to the Provincial Council elections. We have a 52% women population in this country, but there are less that 5% of women in elected bodies.
This major paradigm shift would be an opportunity for women to participate. In this country, money has played a pivotal role in politics. Hence, we could not get community leaders coming into Provincial Councils and local bodies.”
Therefore, he said Dinesh Gunawardena should be the happiest because the government is now doing exactly what his report demanded.
There has been continuous agitation by the masses that we should change the electoral system. Therefore, he said he does not see why the Opposition is now agitating.
“This Bill deals with the Provincial Council legal elections system, thereby I am entitled in terms of Standing Orders to bring whatever committee statement amendment,” he said, urging all to support him in doing away with the preferential system which is detrimental to the voters where priority is given to a person and not to money.
JO stands only against delaying of elections, not about increasing women representation: Dinesh
The Joint Opposition stands only against the delaying of elections and not for the increasing of the women representation, said Joint Opposition Parliamentarian Dinesh Gunawardena in Parliament.
He made this observation yesterday, joining the Second Reading debate on the Provincial Councils Elections (Amendment) Bill.
He also said that there are female members in Local Government Institutions even now. “But they are deprived of their rights by now due to the government activities,” said MP Gunawardena. “The 20th Amendment to the Constitution was introduced to delay the elections.”
He also said that the Joint Opposition went before Court against the 20th Amendment only. “We only demand to know when the Local Government and Provincial Council elections are to be held?” queried MP Gunawardena.
Provincial Council Bill has incorporated suggestions, ideas of all parties: Alagiyawanna
The Provincial Council Bill is one that had incorporated the suggestions and ideas of all parties. People had resentment over the preferential system and wanted it changed, said Deputy Media Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna.
The Deputy Minister made this comment joining the Provincial Council Amendment bill debate in parliament yesterday.
“Even members of the same party fought and sometimes killed each other. We must all accept that we need to do away with the preferential system and bring in a system of appointing a people’s representative who would be responsible for his ward. That is the system we intend to bring in through the Provincial Council Bill. Accordingly, in future all Provincial Council elections will be held according to the new mixed electoral system for the local bodies based on a ward system,” he said.
He added that according to the preferential system, one could not get elected without money. Due to this situation, there are various misconceptions among the people. “The SLFP vowed to assist in doing away with the preferential system. Hence, we are pleased at being able to bring in this new system. Some misinterpret our efforts and say we are afraid of holding elections. However, they must all accept that these changes are necessary for this country. These amendments are brought in according to the provisions of the law.”
Cleaner politics had taken precedence over dirty politics today: Amaraweera
Cleaner politics had taken precedence over dirty politics today. What we need today is to build a new political culture in this country, while the President is determined to establish a clean governance, said Minister Mahinda Amaraweera in Parliament yesterday.
He made this comment during the Provincial Council Amendment Bill debate.
“We entered politics through the preferential electoral system but if anyone wishes to abolish this system, then we would raise both our hands in support. This preferential system has created animosity within the parties and this was the main reason for the killing of Bharatha Lakshman,” he pointed out.
Amaraweera said many lives have been been lost because of this preferential system. During the previous regime, there was a committee appointed to change the electoral system. “We too gave our suggestions to the committee. Even if you ask the people, they will definitely vote for the abolition of the preferential system. One can come up with all sorts of excuses to avoid abolishing this preferential voting system, but it would be a decision that we would have to regret if we choose not to abolish it. The national government was established in order to make a change in the voting system. We are not obliged to anyone as our politics is based on proper policies,” added Amaraweera.
Govt should remove all existing barriers within October to hold elections: Anura
The previous government held elections one after the other when the forces captured Kilinochchi, Thoppigala etc., and that distorted the electoral system which should be changed, said Leader of the Opposition Anura Kumara Dissanayake in Parliament yesterday.
He made this observation yesterday, joining the Second Reading Debate on Provincial Councils Elections (Amendment) Bill.
MP Dissanayake said that to change that system, the Provincial Council elections should be held within two stages next year. To hold the Provincial Council elections we have to pass another several Bills. “The government could remove all these barriers within October to hold those elections,” said MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake. “The government has to assure that these barriers would be removed in order to get our support to pass this Bill.”
At this stage, Leader of the House Minister Lakshman Kiriella said that the government would give that assurance.
However MP Dissanayake too said that eight elections were held in the country within five years. “It is not healthy for the economy of the country,” MP Dissanayake said yesterday. “So we have to think as to how this number of elections could be reduced.”
MP Dissanayake also said that it was very easy for the government to win an election when it was held in several stages, whereas same was difficult for other parties. “So there was a dialogue to hold elections on one day,” said MP Dissanayake. “But the attempt has failed due to a Supreme Court order.”
Increasing of women representation most commendable: Jayasena
Increasing of women’s representation is most commendable. Some of us female ministers got together and formed a women’s forum to lobby for greater women’s representation. This is a result of our efforts, said Deputy Minister of Sustainable Development and Wildlife Sumedha G. Jayasena in Parliament yesterday.
“Holding elections on a ward system was initiated by the UPFA, but as they failed to complete it, the current government is completing it effectively. We commend and approve this move.
Throughout the world women enter politics through a quota system,” she added.
Tense situation as JO storms Well of House: Sumanthiran
A tense situation took place in Parliament yesterday, when Joint Opposition members stormed the Well of the House in protest against the moving of the Second Reading of the debate on the Provincial Councils Elections (Amendment) Bill.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya had to suspend sittings temporarily almost for two hours to reach a decision on the continuation of the debate on the Bill.
The Speaker suspended the sittings around 11.20 am. Following a meeting participated by the Speaker, Party Leaders, the Premier and Attorney General, the sittings resumed at 1.30 pm. The Speaker announced that there was no legal objections to continue the Provincial Councils Elections (Amendment) Bill and the debate continued.
However, while the Joint Opposition members rushed and stood shouting in the Well before the sittings suspended, Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faizer Musthapa commenced the debate and continued with the speech and was followed by Opposition Member M. A. Sumanthiran.
However, the sittings was suspended temporarily by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya around 11.20 am until a decision was reached whether to continue the debate or not, following Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe’s submission. The Premier who attended while MP M A Sumanthiran was on his feet, stated that the Speaker could decide to suspend the sittings or allow the Member speaking to continue until he winds up and then suspend sittings. “However, the Attorney General would come to Parliament after 12 noon,” Premier said.
The Speaker decided to suspend the sittings after MP Sumanthiran wound up his speech.
However, when the Notice of the Motions and Orders of the Day commenced, Joint Opposition Member Dinesh Gunawardena stated that the Provincial Councils Elections (Amendment) Bill was related to the Provincial Councils, yet it had not been directed to the Provincial Councils. He added that the Speaker should deliver a ruling on it. MP Wimal Weerawansa also raising a point of order, maintained the same view.
The Speaker responded that there was no need to direct the same to the Provincial Councils and it was the ruling.
Joint Opposition Member Namal Rajapaksa said that it was not fair to move the Bill in the morning and taking the vote in the evening, as the same was a Bill relating to matters of the Provincial Councils. He requested the Speaker to discuss the matter with the Party leaders and the Prime Minister and deliver a ruling.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya observed that a meeting would be held at 12 noon with Party leaders and the Prime Minister and the Attorney General and suggested to continue the debate until then.
At this point, Joint Opposition MP Gamini Lokuge said that he was the Chairman of the Parliamentary Oversight Committee appointed in relation to this Bill. He added that these amendments were not directed to the Committee at any moment.
Joint Opposition MP Keheliya Rambukwella demanded to submit the views of the Attorney General before Parliament and Speaker Jayasuriya said that he would do so at the proper time.
Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faizer Musthapa said that as the Minister, he could bring amendments to the Act at any moment.
MP Dullas Alahapperuma stated that when it was queried on Tuesday if the government informed the Provincial Councils on the Provincial Councils Elections (Amendment) Bill, the Leader of the House did not answer.
At this stage, the Leader of the House and Minister Kiriella stated that the same matter was in the reserved list and it was not necessary to direct it before the Provincial Councils. “The 18th Amendment to the Constitution was moved in the morning and was passed in the evening,” Minister Kiriella said. “Was it fair? Can you remember how it was passed.”
The Speaker observed that it was not necessary to send the amendments to the Oversight Committee. So the debate could commence.
When Minister Faizer Musthapa commenced the debate, the Joint Opposition members stormed the Well in protest. MPs Dinesh Gunawardena, Dullas Alahapperuma, Keheliya Rambukkwella, Wimal Weerawansa, Tharaka Balasooriya, Udaya Gammanpila, Kumara Welgama, Lohan Ratwatte, Wimalaweera Dissanayake, Arundika Fernando, Namal Rajapaksa, Shehan Semasinghe, etc rushed into the well and stood before the Speakers Bench in protest and started shouting, while Minister Musthapa continued with his speech.
Thereafter Opposition member MA Sumanthiran joined the debate while Joint Opposition members remained at the Well shouting. However, during his speech Sumanthiran was seen interacting with the members at the Well. Some of the member were seen responding to MP Sumanthiran, while the latter recalled the stance of MP Gammanpila in the Supreme Court on Provincial Councils. “MP Gammanpila’s Counsels maintained in Supreme Court that the Provincial Councils were sovereign,” MP Sumanthiran said.
However, National Policies and Economic Affairs Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva raising a point of order, said that the Provincial Councils were not sovereign.
While MP Sumanthiran was in his feet, the Premier attended and submitted his views and later the sittings was suspended around 11.20 after the member wound up his speech.
The sittings resumed at 1.30 pm and the Speaker observed that Party leaders, the Premier and the Attorney General met in the Parliamentary Complex. He also observed that according to the views of the Attorney General, there was no need to inquire into the views of the Provincial Councils on the matter. On the other matter, amendments to a Bill so far has not been submitted before the Parliamentary Oversight Committees. So it was not necessary to submit the amendments before the Parliamentary Oversight Committee. He added that the Bill had been submitted before the Parliamentary Oversight Committee on September this year.
At this stage, MP Weerawansa said that the amendments are three fold bigger than the Bill itself and MP Lokuge said that the one we passed here is not the one we discussed at the Parliamentary Oversight Committee.
At this stage, Leader of the House Kiriella said that MP Dinesh Gunawardena agreed there at the meeting to continue.
“The Bill to be passed is not what was discussed at the Oversight Committee,” said MP Namal Rajapaksa.
“There is a representative of the Attorney General here at the Parlimentary Complex to get his views,” said Minister Kiriella.
The debate was recommenced by Deputy Minister Ajith P Perera.
