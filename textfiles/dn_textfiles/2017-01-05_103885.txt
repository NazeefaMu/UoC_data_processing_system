'Delimitation Review Committee report contains number of errors'

 
The report of the Delimitation Review Committee is incomplete and contains a number of errors, the Government has been informed.
When Committee Chairman Asoka Peiris handed the report over to Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Mustapha on Monday, he refused to accept it on the grounds that two Committee members had not signed it.
The report has not indicated whether the number of seats in Local Government bodies has to be increased under the new electoral system and if so what steps should have to be taken in that regard. It has also not dealt with the changes necessary to the electorates as of the population ratio.
It has also been revealed that the number of elected members would significantly vary as of the new system despite the population of those electoral divisions does not differ much. Comparatively, a small number of seats are given to electoral divisions where a large number of Tamil and Muslim people live in.
For example the population of Dehiatthakandiya Pradeshiya Sabha is 58,937 and the allocated number of seats is 23, whereas only 12 seats have been allocated to the Samanthurei Pradeshiya Sabha which has a population of 68,591. The number of seats allocated to the Uhana Pradeshiya Sabha is 17 and the population is 52,137.
The report has also neglected the purpose of establishing multi member constituencies. As of this system small political parties will not get any representation. Government sources said the report has been hurriedly compiled without adequately addressing the prevailing problems.
