Renault complete takeover of Lotus

Paris, Thursday: Renault completed their takeover of the Lotus team on Thursday ahead of the French manufacturer's return to Formula One in 2016, company boss Carlos Ghosn announced.
"Renault had two options: to come back at 100 percent or leave," said Renault chairman Ghosn .
"After a detailed study, I have decided that Renault will be in Formula 1, starting 2016," he added.
The French firm's return as a full team comes after the acrimonious split with Red Bull which garnered four driver's world titles in a row but ended after Renault had become angered by the Austrian team's criticism of their engines this year.
In taking over Lotus, Renault are essentially buying back the team they had sold to Genii Capital in 2009 and which was renamed Lotus F1 Team for the 2012 season.
Associated with the sport since 1977 Renault has two drivers and constructors titles to its name when Fernando Alonso won back to back championships in 2005-06.
Ghosn, elaborating on his firm's ambitions on their pitlane comeback, added: "Our ambition is to win--even if it will take some time."
