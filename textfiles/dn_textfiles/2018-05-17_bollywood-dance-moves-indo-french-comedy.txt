Bollywood dance moves in Indo-French comedy

Tamil and Hindi movie star Dhanush’s first international film, ‘The Extraordinary Journey of the Fakir’, will feature a full-on Bollywood dance number in the company of Berenice Bejo. While French composer Nicolas Errera has composed the film’s music, Amit Trivedi has contributed three songs to the ‘Fakir’ soundtrack. Montreal-based director Ken Scott revealed that he was mindful of incorporating ‘Indian elements’ because the opening portions of ‘The Extraordinary Journey...’ are set in Mumbai.
“Knowing Dhanush’s exceptional dancing skills, I wanted a great dance number,” Scott said during an interaction in the India Pavilion in the ongoing 71st Cannes Film Festival.
“Berenice is a good dancer too, but she was initially somewhat nervous because these dance moves involved a different kind of choreography. But it worked out perfectly well. It is a fun number,” added the director, who made the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival hit, ‘Starbuck’.
Adapted from a bestselling Romain Puertolas novel titled ‘The Extraordinary Journey of the Fakir Who Got Trapped in an IKEA Wardrobe’, the film will open in France on May 30 before it goes into worldwide distribution. Co-producer Aditi Anand of Little Red Car Films revealed that a July release is being planned for the Dhanush-Berenice Bejo starrer. A Tamil version of the film, keeping Dhanush’s fan following in mind, will be released. PTI
