A woman who ended an affair was asked by her lover to return all the goods he had given her earlier, including 250 grams of dry fish, Katugastota Police said.
According to the minor offence branch at Katugastota Police, a 53-year-old woman had started an affair with a man after her husband’s demise. However, after living together, the woman realized he was involved with some other women too, at the same time.
