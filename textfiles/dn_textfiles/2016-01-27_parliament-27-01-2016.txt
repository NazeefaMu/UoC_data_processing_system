[PARLIAMENT - (27-01-2016)]

Petitions against three Bills
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya informed Parliament that petitions have been filed before the Supreme Court against the Local Government Elections (Amendment) Bill, Theravadi Bhikku Kathikawath Bill and Micro-finance Bill. He observed that the three Bills cannot be taken up in the House until the Supreme Court comes up with its determinations on the the Bills.
The Speaker said two petitions have been filed against the Local Government Elections (Amendment) Bill, one against the Theravadi Bhikku Kathikawath Bill and three against Micro-finance Bill.
Foreign service to gain strength
The government is in the middle of restructuring the Foreign Ministry, Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera said joining the adjournment debate in Parliament yesterday.
“It meets the challenges of the modern world. We have lot to do. When this government came into power, quality and quantity were in a crisis,” he said. Minister Samaraweera said the Foreign Ministry had over 100 vacancies. Ministry exams were not held regularly. Most foreign ministries have intakes every year. But in the last 10 years, there were only two intakes.
“Within six months of office, we recruited 25 new officers through open competitive exams. We hope to hold these exams annually. Even the approved cardre is insufficient. We have 67 missions abroad. Before January 2015, out of the 67 embassies, there were only 15 SLFS heads of missions. Others were political appointees selected by the Head of the State," he said.
The minister said many of them were relations of the first family of the country. They were indulging in their private businesses. Some of them sold buildings belonging to the Foreign Ministry. Investigations are continuing. The SLFS has 34 competent and efficient foreign service officers, he said.
Professionals go unhindered by ETCA - Harsha
Professionals will have no adverse impact from the Indo-Sri Lanka Economic and Technology Cooperative Agreement (ETCA), said Foreign Affairs Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva.
He made this observation in Parliament yesterday joining the adjournment motion moved by MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena.
He said the government will enter into the agreement in a manner that would benefit the nation.
“Foreign investors have to build up confidence on us for them to come and make their investments,” the Deputy Minister said. In 2011, a number of institutions were acquired by the government. But nothing was given to the owners of those institutions as compensation, he said.
Regaining investors’ confidence is a tall order - Mangala
Regaining investors' confidence after five years of waste and corruption will not be an easy task, Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera told in Parliament yesterday.
"One quick and important way of demonstrating our good faith and that Sri Lanka is open for business is by signing investment promotion and protection agreements," the Minister said. These agreements ensure that there is a transparent and level playing field for all investors. There is nothing to fear from these agreements. All they do is to protect investors, he said.
Minister Samaraweera was joining in a debate on agreements Sri Lanka entered with several
other nations during the adjournment motion debate. The government was elected to create one million jobs within five years by increasing investments and boosting exports. It is the responsibility of the government to make that vision a reality, he said. The Prime Minister’s economic policy statement on November 5 outlined plans to boost investments, exports and growth. The country can meet this target by 2020, he said. There was no job creation during the previous regime. There were no investments. According to the cooked up statistics of the previous regime, the growth was fueled by unsustainable and poorly negotiated borrowings, he said.
Minister Malik Samarawickrema will soon make a statement in Parliament about the kind of response the country received at Davos when a Sri Lankan delegation went there recently. Sri Lanka is considered as a frontier market. "We will have to stand out and compete harder and smarter than others. In such a difficult domestic and international climate, the question for the government is how we attract investments and generate jobs while ensuring that we reduce our dependency and risk," Samaraweera said.
Foreign investors come to Sri Lanka after new change - Ajith Perera
Foreign investors come to Sri Lanka as new change was brought about on January 8 last year putting a full stop to corruption, said Power and Renewable Energy Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera.
He made this observation yesterday joining the adjournment motion moved by Parliamentarian Dinesh Gunawardena yesterday.
“We are working with China and India. We work with them in the same manner that Mahinda Rajapaksa did during the previous regime," he said.
He said the previous regime reached the decisions on development projects keeping an eye on the commission.
The failures of the Norochchole coal power plant were not due to the China's faults, but due to the political decisions taken by the Sri Lankan side, the Deputy Minister said.
“We would launch the development of power plants in the country in a transparent manner," he said. He said the government does not give bribes to any other country. The government does not deal with the other countries on the terms of the previous government, but on those of this government which would benefit the people, Minister Perera said.
Conflicting views on War Tribunal - Namal
The President's statements contradict the Foreign Ministry's views on the War Tribunal, said UPFA Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa.
He said the Foreign Ministry has promised the European Union that foreign judges would be used in the war tribunal while the President told the foreign media that war tribunal would consist of the local judges.
He made these observations in Parliament yesterday joining the adjournment debate moved by MP Dinesh Gunawardena.
Rajapaksa said the Prime Minister realised that Sri Lanka can get valuable support from China although they made objections against it during the previous regime.
He said the government has realised that the Port City Project is important.
“We maintained that we have to build up new relationships to develop economy of the country. That is why we built them up. We had different views within the Cabinet. But they were not personal,” Rajapaksa said.
Stable economy needed to woo investors - Dinesh
UPFA Parliamentarian Dinesh Gunawardane told in Parliament yesterday that a country should have a stable economy to attract investors. Sri Lanka is experiencing an economic crisis. Sri Lankan Rupee has been depreciated.
He made this observation moving the adjournment motion in Parliament. The Foreign Ministry recently came in to agreements with countries such as Thailand, Qatar, Kuwait, Vietnam, Malaysia and India.
The safety of foreign investment should be guaranteed through the enactment of a two-thirds majority in Parliament as the Constitutional Guarantee of Investment Protection Agreements.
Under article 157 of the Constitution, no legislative, executive or administrative action can be taken to contravene the provisions of a bilateral investment agreement.
He said foreign missions should contribute to uplift the country’s image in the international arena. They should take measures to find better market opportunities for main export crops; tea and rubber in the international market.
“Though the Yahapalana government promised to ensure the foreign service free of political interferences, they failed to keep that promise. By appointing a member of the UNP executive committee to the foreign service, the government has breached that promise,” he said.
He said the President and the Foreign Ministry have conflicting views on the Geneva agreement. Expressing his views to the BBC, President Maithripala Sirisena said foreign judges should not intervene in hearing Human Rights allegations and foreign specialists or a special court to hear the allegations are not needed. These controversial ideas will badly affect to the country, Gunawardane said.
‘Govt should submit draft of Indo-Sri Lanka economic agreement to Parliament’
The government should submit the draft of the proposed Indo-Sri Lanka economic agreement to Parliament, UPFA Parliamentarian Vasudeva Nanayakkara said joining the adjournment debate in Parliament yesterday. MP Nanayakkara said the Foreign Affairs Ministry acts as a separate State. Conflicting ideas of the ministry and the President on the Geneva agreement have proven this.
The world has a suspicion over the relations maintained by the Foreign Minister with Israel, the MP said.
He said a recent statement on the Geneva agreement made by the President Sirisena to the BBC has proved that the President has betrayed the UNP.
‘No trouble for professionals’
The government will not put professionals into difficulty by signing the CEPA agreement, UNP Parliamentarian Mujuber Rahuman said.
He made this observation yesterday joining the adjournment motion moved by MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena.
“Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has assured that the government would not deprive the opportunities of the country's professionals. But there is an attempt by some groups to spread adversarial attitudes among the people against India," Rahuman said.
He said communist parties have joined capitalist parties and formed governments. They have betrayed communism, he said.
New MP takes oath
Mohammed Sharif Thawfik took oath as a Parliamentarian before Speaker Karu Jayasuriya in Parliament yesterday.
He took oath in place of the seat fell vacant by the resignation of National List MP Abdul Rauf Hafees of the Muslim Congress.
