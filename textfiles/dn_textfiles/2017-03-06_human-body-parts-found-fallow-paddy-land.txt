Human body parts found in fallow paddy land

Weeraketiya Police found parts of a human body in a fallow paddy land at Nararatnamulana in Manduwawa Weeraketiya yesterday.
Police also found two mobile phones and a belt worn by elderly men lying beside the spot. The parts of a human body are suspected to be that of one Edagamage Charles, 87, of Attanayaka who was reported missing two weeks ago.
A daughter and a son of Charles identified the two mobile phones and the belt as those used by their father.
They said they had made a complaint to Weeraketiya and Agunukolapelessa Police about the disappearance of their father. Police had even published a notice with the father's picture in newspapers seeking public information to help trace him. A magisterial inquiry on the body parts was due to be held today. Weeraketiya Police are investigating.
