Kuznetsova  chasing Konta  for last WTA Finals place

 
Johanna Konta can only be overtaken by Svetlana Kuznetsova in the race to qualify for the WTA Finals, after Carla Suarez Navarro’s hopes ended in Moscow.
Suarez Navarro could have passed Konta by winning the Kremlin Cup but retired with a wrist injury in round two.
Konta is in line to take the eighth and final place at the season-ending event, but the Briton is not competing this week as she recovers from injury. Kuznetsova, who needs to win the Kremlin Cup, beat Alize Cornet 6-4 7-5. The Russian, who is the defending champion, will play Hungary’s Timea Babos in the quarter-finals on Thursday.
“I try not to think about it,” said Kuznetsova. “It’s a tough goal - I have to win the Kremlin Cup, meaning it’s a long way to go. I will do my best.”
Konta, 25, is eighth in the Singapore standings following the withdrawal of world number two Serena Williams, but it is not clear whether the Briton would be fit to play should she qualify. BBC
