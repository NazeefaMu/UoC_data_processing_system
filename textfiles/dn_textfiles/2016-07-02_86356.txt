Sri Lanka wins toss, elects to field in final ODI with England

 
Sri Lanka won the toss and chose to bowl on a Cardiff pitch expected to assist seam bowlers.
England Captain Eoin Morgan said he would have opted to bowl first as well.
It is the first time in the series England will be asked to set a total.
Alex Hales has been omitted from England's XI with a "minor niggle" - he was forced to leave the field at The Oval with a back injury - and James Vince steps into the top order for the hosts.
Spin-bowling allrounder Moeen Ali is also displaced by a seam bowler in Chris Jordan, on account of the grassy surface which is likely to aid the quicks.
England already have the series sewn up 2-0.
Left arm seam bowler Chaminda Bandara will debut in place of all-rounder Farveez Maharoof for Sri Lanka.
That decision is likely to have been spurred by a desire to beef up the attack, after the England batsmen ran down 308 with 11 balls to spare on Wednesday.
Rain is expected to interrupt play, and had in fact begun to come down as the toss formalities were being completed.
The start of play was delayed by ten minutes but the weather is forecast to improve as the afternoon progresses.
 
England:  1 James Vince, 2 Jason Roy, 3 Joe Root, 4 Eoin Morgan (Capt), 5 Jonny Bairstow, 6 Jos Buttler (wk), 7 Chris Jordan, 8 Chris Woakes, 9 David Willey, 10 Liam Plunkett, 11 Adil Rashid. 
Sri Lanka1 Kusal Perera, 2 Danushka Gunathilaka, 3 Kusal Mendis, 4 Dinesh Chandimal, 5 Angelo Mathews (capt), 6 Seekkuge Prasanna, 7 Upul Tharanga, 8 Dasun Shanaka, 9 Chaminda Bandara, 10 Nuwan Pradeep, 11 Suranga Lakmal
