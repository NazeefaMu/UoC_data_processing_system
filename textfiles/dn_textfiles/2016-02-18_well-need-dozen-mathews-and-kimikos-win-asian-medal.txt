"We'll need a dozen Mathews and Kimikos to win an Asian medal"

Sri Lanka's celebrated swim star and three-time Olympian Julian Bolling said the country will need "at least a dozen Mathews and Kimikos" if they are to win an Asian Games medal in swimming within the next decade.
Referring to Mathew Abeysinghe and Kimiko Raheem, who won seven and five gold medals respectively in swimming at the recently concluded Asian Games in Guwahati, India, the former Sri Lanka swimmer turned coach insisted on a concrete program to groom next generation swimmers with sufficient international exposure.
A proud product of Royal College, Colombo, Bolling has been the most successful swimmer that Sri Lanka has ever produced, accounting for a record 15 South Asian Games gold medals, including five in his last of four appearances in 1991.
The head coach of Rainbow Aquatics and the Director of the Rainbow Swimming Academy, Bolling had the rare honour of representing Sri Lanka at three Olympic Games - in Los Angeles in 1984 as a schoolboy, as well as at the 1988 and 1992 Barcelona Games. During his illustrious career as a celebrated Lankan swimmer, Bolling has made it to six finals in his two Asian Games appearances.
Here are excerpts from an interview:
Q: It has been 25 long years since you set a new record with five gold medals at the Vth South Asian Games in Colombo. How do you look back at that performance and the country's progress in swimming since then?
A: We are happy that we have won 12 gold medals in swimming at the recent South Asian Games. But medals are not records. Records are achieved through better timings. Hence, it's the performance that matters if we are to talk about the country's overall standards in swimming.
The gold medal we won in relay at the 1991 South Asian Games was the greatest achievement for me because that speaks volumes of the country's standards in swimming. Medals won in swimming at the last South Asian Games are nothing to do with national plans but purely due to the individual brilliance Mathew Abeysinghe and Kimiko Raheem and the investments made by their parents coupled by proper guidance.
Q: What are your observations on planning and achieving higher standards in Sri Lanka swimming?
A: Zero! There has not been any collective effort or a plan to go for it. I was abroad when I was preparing for 1991 South Asian Games but I was told that we had a well-knit plan.
It's very simple in any trade, be it sports, tourism or any other sphere. If we don't plan anything properly and make hard preparations, you cannot achieve anything. Overall, we should not be overjoyed and it was not a great result at the Games. Of course we could feel happy that we were ahead of Pakistan and Bangladesh in the final overall medals table at the last SA Games.
There was a huge contingent that went for the Games in India and if the two gold medal-winning swimmers had not participated, our gold haul would have been slashed by half. Hence, we need a solid plan to develop the sport.
Q: How do you analyze the performance of Mathew Abeysinghe and Kimiko Raheem who shared 12 swimming gold medals between them?
A: Very interesting! Their timings are very good. I have not compared the last Asian Games timings with their performance. But they may be able to make it at least to the finals of the next Asian Games, provided they improve on their timings further.
Q: Sri Lanka won 12 gold medals in swimming at the last SA Games, that's 25 years after you and Dipika Chanmugam shared equal number of golds in 1991. Does that mean that our swimming had regained its lost glory or do you see an overall decline in South Asian standards?
A: We could analyze it in two ways. One is our performance at the 2016 SA Games is much better than we did at the previous games in 2010 where we were placed only fourth in the overall medals table. At least we are ahead of Pakistan and Bangladesh now.
However, I don't think the overall standard of Sri Lanka sport has improved. At the last Asian Games, a non-Olympic sport such as cricket had to come to Sri Lanka's rescue to win a solitary gold and silver medal.
We have hardly invested on next generation of athletes. Some of our athletes who had eventually won gold medals in India had to stay in temples when they were competing at the trials before the Games. That was very unfortunate.
Q: What are your main suggestions to develop Olympic sport in Sri Lanka?
A: Basically, I have two key suggestions which I consider to be essential to produce results at international level. Firstly, we need to construct a 400-bed hostel in Colombo for sportsmen and women to stay when they come for competition and training. If not, they would be compelled to look for makeshift accommodation in places such as temples as they did at the last athletic trials in Homagama.
We could have tolerated if that had happened 40 years ago. But definitely not in an era like this when we talk about intensive training for the big league.
Unless we construct such hostel facilities for national level sportsmen and women, no authority could boast that they had done so much for the development of sport.
Secondly, we need a foreign consultant to take care of high performance training of our top sportsmen and women. Why we need a foreign expert is because that nobody could then hoodwink or get undue advantages, be it political or otherwise. If we do that we could sail again.
Q:Are you happy with the progress made by the national body for aquatic sport - the Sri Lanka Aquatic Sports Union?
A: We are now working with a new federation which has a set of properly elected officials at the last AGM. I don't hold any official position but I support them in the development and promotion of the sport, especially in the outstations. There is so much of raw talent in the outstations and we need to tap them at the right time and groom them carefully for the future.
Q: Is there any hope for Sri Lanka swimmers to go beyond South Asian level? Do you think that we could win an Asian Games swimming medal at least within the next decade or so?
A: India, being a country with a huge population, has produced just two bronze medals at the last two Asian Games. But they had made a lot of effort and hard training for eight years to achieve that.
In China and Japan, there are two world class set of swimmers competing at Asian Games. It is a gigantic task to challenge their superiority. Nevertheless, we could focus on an Asian Games medal if we make a lot of hard effort.
In order to achieve that, we need a lot of money to fund intensive training and international exposure in competition. If we work on a concrete plan and make an investment for the future, it would not be a distant dream.
However, we need a dozen of Mathews and Kimikos if we are to embark on an ambitious program to win an Asian Games medal.
Q: Personally, what have you been doing in recent times?
A: I was in Kandy this week for a three-day workshop for 'Better Fathers at Home'. I feel most fathers are not taking their rightful place at homes.
We try to attract their attention to play that vital role. We train different sets of trainers and in return they would go back to their respective stations and make our fathers aware of their responsibilities. We plan a similar workshop in Galle next week.
Q: Finally, what is your advice to those taking to swimming?
A: Create a passion for it and work hard with dedication. Enjoy the sport and make it a lifestyle!
