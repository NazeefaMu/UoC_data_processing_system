Breast  cancer  survivor launches eco bras

When Stephanie Devine was diagnosed with breast cancer, she struggled to find a bra to accommodate her needs. Rather than give in, however, she decided to launch her own range of eco-friendly intimates.
After four years in development, the Very Good Bra is entirely made from sustainable Eucalyptus trees and natural fibres; its slogan is ‘no wire, no toxins, no waste’.
“The more I’ve learned about materials, the more I’ve had to re-calibrate my thinking in terms of what is “good”. Once you discover that it takes 20,000 litres of water to produce a kilogram of cotton, organic or not, it really gets you thinking,” she tells the Mail Online.
“When you realise that apparel is the second-largest polluting industry in the world behind oil and gas, and that 40 percent of landfill is clothing, you realise that if things are going to change, you need to do your bit.”
The fibre is knitted and organically dyed; tree-rubber and elastic is sourced at sustainably-managed plantations which are then knitted into strap elastic. All metals used are cadmium and nickel free.
Although Stephanie is not openly advocating for ‘zero-waste wardrobes’, she is hoping that her bra might inspire people to think a little harder about their buying choices. And, of course, she’s hoping that the public thinks more carefully about their overall sustainable behaviour.
The Very Good Bra is supposed to be so eco-friendly that the brand claims it’s “so clean it could even be buried in the garden after use.”
“Ditch plastic straws, bottles and bags to begin with,” she says.
Invest in a keep cup and make it part of your normal coffee routine.
“Wherever possible, don’t take the packaging when shopping and where there are two comparable options, choose the one that is consciously trying to be clean.”
