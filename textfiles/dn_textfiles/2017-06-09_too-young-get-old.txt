Too young to get old!

 
 
They will go down their different paths but one thing is certain, they will never forget those days when they all achieved something great, something wonderful, something unforgettable. They came together as a family and though they may never see each other again they will never forget each other. Dramatic Moves features the Thespians of St. Peter’s College.
“Our Drama club was formed in 1924, and we are the oldest club at St. Peter’s College when it comes to Drama at 93 years. Whenever possible, we explore all types of Drama depending on the availability of the Cast and their talents. Our Directors Jehan Bastians and Neidra Williams know the potential of the boys and most of the boys have worked under them since they were youngsters. According to them the cast is formed and we choose our scripts accordingly,” said Teacher in Charge of the English Literary and Drama Society (ELDS)/ Moderator (Drama) Imogen Mel.
Mel has known these boys from the time they were kids.
“I have seen them step on to stage with joyous faces, small kids that they were. I have seen them grow over the years, and they enjoy their drama. They have matured in their acting. From tiny tots, I have seen them becoming mature actors. I am proud of them because they are the future of St. Peter’s College. They are leaving behind a set of youngsters who have learnt from them and will become our future dramatists. They want to share their knowledge with the new generation and that is one of their strengths- the fact that they want to give back,” stated Mel.
“This is basically drama at St. Peter’s. Jehan is an old Peterite. He is sharing his knowledge with these boys and they in turn share their knowledge with their juniors. Drama is another way of education. It is not just stepping on stage and acting, it is a way of life. And they have learnt it. This is another one of their strengths,” pointed out Mel.
Last year was a dream come true for St. Peter’s, when they became Overall Champions for 2016 at Shakespeare.
“Last year was a dream come true for us. That moment I will always treasure for all my life. We had tears in our eyes. After so many years of struggle we finally won the cup. The winning production was Julius Caesar and the three other schools, were St. Joseph’s, Wesley College and Royal. For this we owe a lot to Jehan and Neidra for molding our children. There was a Faux Pas, because they announced us as ‘third place’ and then the judge got up and corrected the error and announced us as ‘Champions.’ I will never forget that cheer that came up!” elucidated Mel.
Another unforgettable production they did was ‘Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.’
“This was our public production this year in January. This was a one year practice. During that time we took part in Shakespeare. I told them they would be too tired but they felt they were equal to the task and ultimately they won Shakespeare. For ‘Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat,’ we had four sold out shows. I was at the gate and people were asking me if they could stand and watch! Colombo went crazy over Joseph!,” explained Mel.
The attachment that Mel has with the boys is quite evident.
“They are a lovable lot. They are very talented. They have to be led and guided, after all they are still children in my eyes. They are very eager about drama and they give 100 percent, while making many sacrifices. They are passionate about Peterite drama,” added Mel.

Method acting
President, Dion Weerasinghe feels that one of their biggest strengths is that they function as a family. “That is what we focus on mostly, we bond as a group during practices. That helps us enjoy the whole process and helps our performance onstage,” said Weerasinghe.
Weerasinghe has a method he uses when stepping into someone’s skin.
“There is one method when it comes to acting that is called ‘Method Acting.’ Which I find very favorable. If there is something I find hard to imagine, Method acting for me is the easiest way. You put yourself into the scenario of your character. Then you base your feelings on what your character would be feeling. That is the easiest and most intense way you can get into your character,” explained Weerasinghe.
Weerasinghe excitedly explained, that definitely drama at St. Peter’s will continue to thrive and prosper. “I can see at practices that the younger ones have matured and they listen very well and understand what is happening. When I see this I am proud and impressed. They will keep on growing. Jehan and Neidra have been with us for a long time. They spend a lot of time on us. They do this for pure joy. The old boys also keep giving us ideas and supporting us. Drama at Peter’s will be strong in the years to come,” pointed out Weerasinghe.
“The extract we did (for the winning production), did not focus on Caesar. Even in Julius Caesar he comes in the first act, the main part of Julius Caesar is when he dies. But the main characters are Brutus, Cassius and Casca. They are the people who basically ‘run the show’.”
Weerasinghe recalled one of their performances at the Royal Interact Drama Competition.
“We did a drama on bullying. This was controversial and modern. It examined five different aspects of bullying e.g. bullying by peers, teachers and society. We had five main characters/ actors who played five different roles. These five different actors were directed by five different old boys of St. Peter’s. It helps you look at the world in a different way. We have a lot of talented old boys. They have so much knowledge and experience in the field of drama and they come back and give everything to college,” added Weerasinghe.

A really good teacher
Vice President of Drama, Sheshan Dias, feels that they look after each other very well. “One of our main strengths is that we bond as a cast. Before the play we make sure we have chemistry as a team. We know what everyone’s strengths and weaknesses are. We build up each others’ strengths and cover up the weaknesses,” said Dias.
Dias felt that the intensity of the competition these days in the Drama Circuit has changed.
“These days the competition and the standards are quite high in the Drama Circuit these days. This is especially true when it comes to Shakespeare. Getting into the finals is now a really big matter. Winning is both superb and indescribable,” pointed out Dias.
Dias placed emphasis on the importance of having a good director.
“Jehan has been very supportive. He can read people very well. He has always been there for us, whenever we have needed him. He is a really good teacher, and has taught us about a lot of things, not only drama but life,” stated Dias.

A lot of experience
Secretary Dylon Walker, spoke about the challenge of taking on a female role. “Playing a female role is challenging. It is not something that you are used to. It takes a lot of courage to get into that outfit, and step on stage and act like a female,” said Walker.
The experience you get from drama helps you tackle obstacles.
“In drama you get a lot of experience, so whatever challenges may come, you know how to handle it. You also learn from your seniors. You are able to cope with any challenge,” stated Walker
Walker initially was reluctant to speak in public
“I had the fear of public speaking, but I do not have it anymore. This is because of drama. Now I can freely speak and nothing holds me back anymore,” explained Walker.

A talent factory
Past President, Demintha Fonseka, said that St. Peter’s is a talent factory.
“I have come to realize this year, that there is a lot of talent at St. Peter’s College. Even though there have been old boys who have gone out to do amazing things in the circle of theatre in Sri Lanka, there is still so much talent right now at college. This needs to come out and it needs to be showcased. I think we have a really good team for future years,” said Fonseka.

A long legacy
Past Secretary, Devinda De Silva, feels the young ones at St. Peter’s are ready to take up the challenge of carrying St. Peter’s into the future.
“Our performance at the recent Royal Drama Competition really proved that. The younger batches are ready. I have seen a performance of St. Peter’s that I could not believe due to its high standard. It is very important that students come back each year to act with us, because no one becomes a good actor in one year. Our club has a long legacy. The continuance and the fact that these guys keep coming back, have provided an amazing platform for us,” said De Silva.

Enhancing ones personality
Vice President of Literary Activities, Ayoob Aboosalih, felt that drama enhances ones personality.
“Drama has helped me come out a lot as a person. It has really helped me develop my personality.
During these last three years I must say that it has really taught me skills like learning to work with others,” said Aboosalih.

Hard work
Treasurer, Abhishek Fernandez, felt that at St. Peter’s they are proud of their school.
“In a school that is big like this, people expect a lot. So you know that at St. Peter’s there is a standard to keep. So the amount of work you put in really is a lot. A person gives more than 100 percent. This can be for anything done at St. Peter’s. Hard work is something that is very important and expected,” said Fernandez.
At St. Peter’s they do a public production every three years. During the years in between, they do three drama competitions. It is a pretty busy schedule. Regardless of the acting pool, the committee is always small. So it is difficult for them to work on inter-house drama as well.
The boys all agreed that their parents have been extremely understanding and tolerant. There two Directors Jehan and Neidra are very accommodating and flexible when it comes to parents. They understand the parental issues.
Practices for “Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dream Coat” lasted for a year before the Show Dates, Therefore we took part in and Won Shakes 2016 while practicing for this Public Production which Sold Out 4/5 of its performances
