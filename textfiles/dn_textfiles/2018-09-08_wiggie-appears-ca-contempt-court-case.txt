Wiggie appears before CA in contempt of court case

Northern Province Chief Minister and former Supreme Court Judge C.V. Wigneswaran and three others appeared before the Court of Appeal yesterday over a complaint that they have intentionally acted in contempt of the Court of Appeal order.
When the application came up before Justice Janak de Silva, the three respondents Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran and two other Provincial Council Ministers Ananthi Sasitharan and K.Sivanesan were advised to appear in Court on September 18 as well.
This matter will be taken up before Court of Appeal two-judge-Bench on the next date.
The Court of Appeal made this order following a complaint made by B. Denishwaran alleging that Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran and Ananthi Sasitharan and K. Sivanesan have willfully acted in contempt of the Court of Appeal order since they prevented him from acting as a Minister of the Northern Province.
The Court of Appeal had yesterday further extended the Interim Order, preventing the decision of Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran to remove B. Denishwaran from functioning as the Minister of Fisheries and Transport in the province until October 9.
Denishwaran stated that the first Respondent, Justice Wigneswaran has, by his conduct and statements, acted in contumacious and willful disobedience of the order of Court of Appeal and thus committed an act of contempt against the authority and dignity of the Court of Appeal.
The Court of Appeal on June 29 issued an Interim Order preventing the decision of Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran to expel B. Denishwaran from functioning as the Fisheries and Transport Minister in the province.
The petitioner B. Denishwaran had challenged Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran in the Court of Appeal, complaining that the Chief Minister had no power to appoint or remove any Provincial Council minister.
Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran had also filed an appeal in the Supreme Court challenging the Court of Appeal’s Interim Order to prevent Wigneswaran’s decision to remove B.Denishwaran from functioning as the Minister of Fisheries and Transport in the province. This appeal is to be taken up before Court on September 28.
Counsel Suren Fernando appeared for the petitioner Denishwaran. President’s Counsel K. Kanag-iswaran appeared for Chief Minister Wigneswaran. Saliya Peiris PC with M.A. Sumanthiran appeared for the other respondents.
