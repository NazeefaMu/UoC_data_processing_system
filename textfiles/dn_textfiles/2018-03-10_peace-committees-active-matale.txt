Peace committees active in Matale

Politicians in the Matale district were seen in several Mosques yesterday speaking to the Muslim community, in a bid to ease tensions in the area as a result of the clashes which occurred in Kandy over the past days.
Several minor, racially motivated incidents had been reported around Matale town in the last few days leading to all religious places having security forces deployed to them. Police as well as Air Force personnel were seen providing security to these places of religious worship.
Agriculture State Minister Wasantha Aluvihare, Plantation Industries Deputy Minister, Lakshman Wasantha Perera and Sri Lanka Freedom Party's Matale District Organiser, Ujith Anuradha and DIG Deshabandu Tennekoon had visited the mosques in the area to ensure their security.
