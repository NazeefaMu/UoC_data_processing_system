Dispensers to get promotions

Dispensers will be absorbed as pharmacists, and a system will be formulated to promote them, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said. <U+200B>
Midwives will be given opportunities to enter into the nursing service, he said. The Minister was addressing a ceremony held in Colombo recently.
Minister Senaratne said steps will be taken to make changes with the support of trade unions. "I am facing various problems because I reduced the prices of drugs. Now the drug mafia is creating problems. Drug companies do not assist doctors' organisations," he said. Some get disturbed when they do not receive any benefits. That is why some doctors criticise the Minister, he said.<U+200B>
