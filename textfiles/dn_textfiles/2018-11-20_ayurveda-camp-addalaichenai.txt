Ayurveda camp at Addalaichenai

An awareness walk and a free ayurvedic medical camp were held in Addalaichenai to mark the World Diabetes Day, recently.
The programme was organised by the Addalaichenai Base Ayurvedic Hospital Medical Officer-In-charge Dr. K. M. Aslam.
In Sri Lanka, about two million people are diagnosed with diabetes, Addalaichenai Base Ayurvedic Hospital Medical Officer-In-charge Dr. Aslam said.
People should be aware of non-communicable diseases and the food they consume, he said.
Dr. Aslam added, “we do not pay much attention to food. Due to the lack of physical exercises, people are diabetic, suffering from blood pressure, heart diseases and paralysis.”
A large number of residents participated in the ayurvedic medical camp.
Ayurvedic doctors, Health Department officials, government officers and others also attended.
