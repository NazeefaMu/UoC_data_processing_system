Parliament

Draft Agreement on H'tota Port joint venture presented to house
Port and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe, presented the draft agreement related to the Hambantota Port Joint Venture in Parliament yesterday.
The Government has facilitated a full day debate on it on Friday.
The draft agreement tabled in Parliament yesterday, stated there would be a strict prohibition from using Hambantota Port property or surrounding areas for any military activity. The agreement specifies that the use of the port property and the common user facilities shall be strictly dedicated for the purpose of port and marine related commercial and development activities stipulated in the agreement.
It also states that “the sole authority for granting all requisite permissions, clearances and approvals for bringing in or berthing of warships, submarines or storing, warehousing of any military equipment and machinery, installation of communication networks/facilities shall only be with the GOSL.”
The GOSL will also establish its own level of domestic environmental and other protections and its own sustainable development laws, policies and priorities and submit its commitments in occurrence with, and subject to the rules of international law, treaties and conventions.
The signatories to the public - private partnership agreement for the Port of Hambantota, would be the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), Secretary to the Ministry of Ports and Shipping and the China Merchants Port Holdings Company (CMPort) Limited, according to the agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, CMPort will invest a sum of US$ 1.12 billion in Hambantota Port and marine related activities.
The Ports Authority will incorporate two separate private limited liability companies in Sri Lanka as independent profit oriented enterprises, with the two companies capitalized to a cumulative value of US$1.4 billion, including through the transfer of assets of the Port of Hambantota and leasing out the man-made island.
The agreement says that all fossils, minerals, antiquities, structures or other remnants or things either of particular geological or archaeological interest found in the port property or surrounding area shall be deemed to be the absolute property of the GOSL.
Several bills passed in Parliament amidst chaos
The Government yesterday, rushed through the business of Parliament and passed the National Building Tax (Amendment) Bill and several Orders under the Special Commodity Levy Act amidst chaos in the House.
Joint Opposition MPs made a din in the House protesting against the arrest of several CPC Trade Unionists and assault on striking CPC workers. Speaker Karu Jayasuriya tried to go ahead with the day’s business urging the support of all MPs, but failed in the attempt.
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella wanted the Speaker to proceed with the proceedings and place the items listed in the agenda before the House.
Accordingly, the Government moved five Orders under the Special Commodity Levy Act, a Resolution under the Customs Ordinance and Nation Building Tax (Amendment) Bill amidst heavy disturbances from the Opposition.
MEP Leader MP Dinesh Gunawardena objecting to Kiriella, stated that Minister Faiszer Musthapha was present in the House to reply to a question raised by him on a previous date and that the minister should be allowed to read his reply before proceeding to the main business of the House. However, Kiriella maintained that there was no suitable atmosphere to make a ministerial statement due to the unruly behaviour of JO MPs.
The seven items listed on the Order Paper were moved one by one by the Speaker amidst objections by the JO and JVP. Kiriella read out amendments to the National Building Tax Bill at the Committee stage and the Speaker announced the Bill was passed. Following the passage of legislation, the Speaker immediately adjourned Parliament around 3.30pm till 10.30 am today.
MEP leader agitates against Gazette Extraordinary
Parliament was to take up a full day's debate today on the Gazette Extraordinary issued by the President at midnight Tuesday, proclaiming all services relating to the supply and distribution of fuel as an essential public service.
The decision was taken by the Parliament Business Committee headed by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, following a tense situation in Parliament yesterday.
Joint Opposition members led by MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena agitated in the House over a statement by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, explaining the reasons that led to the issuance of the Gazette Extraordinary.
Speaker Jayasuriya who repeatedly warned the MPs to take their seats and stop disrupting the proceedings, was forced to temporarily suspend sittings around 2.20pm amidst chaos created by JO MPs.
As House resumed sittings at 3.05 pm, the House heated up once again when the news broke on the arrest of CPC Trade Unionists. Both the JO and JVP urged for the intervention of the Premier to have them released. The Prime Minister replying to these concerns, said none of the TU members would be detained, adding that they would be allowed to leave after their recording statements were recorded.
JO members also made a din in the House shouting at the Government that the striking workers of the CPC were being attacked by a gang of thugs near the Kolonnawa oil tanks. The Premier refuting such claims, stressed the Government would tackle the situation without any bloodshed. “This is not Weliweriya, but Kolonnawa. We do not shoot at anybody. I came to know there had been certain incidents near the gate of the Kolonnawa tanks as some persons were not allowed to enter. The Police had used tear gas at that instance,” the Premier said.
Wickremesinghe repeatedly questioned the JO as to why they did not protest when the Hambantota oil tanks were vested under the Ports Authority and not the CPC by the former regime led by Mahinda Rajapaksa. “The oil tanks within the Hambantota Port premises were given to the Ports Authority by the previous regime. It was not our decision. You were ministers of the then Cabinet. Why did you not protest?” he questioned.
No sufficient proof that JMO handed over body parts to SAITM: Govt.
The Government yesterday stated there had no sufficient proof to claim that former Colombo Chief Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) handed over certain human body parts to SAITM after the postmortem examination.
Chief Government Whip and Minister Gayantha Karunathilake made this observation, replying to a question raised by MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara in Parliament.
Minister Karunathilake further said action could be taken against any official who had made any statement contrary to the above.
MP Nanayakkara said the revelation that the Colombo Chief JMO handed over certain human body parts to SAITM, came up during investigations carried out by the Government. However, the Government denied that there had been any such proof.
Minister Karunathilake also rejected the claim that Sri Lanka Police had handed over certain human body parts to SAITM, adding that the Police had no authority to do so sans a Court order.
Disruption results in temporary suspension of Parliament
The Joint Opposition members led by MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena agitated in the House over a statement by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe explaining the reasons that led to the issuance of the Gazette Extraordinary.

The JO members also made a din in the House shouting at the Government that the striking workers of the CPC were being attacked by a gang of thugs near Kolonnawa oil tanks. The Premier refuting these claims stressed the Government would tackle the situation in a way that there would be no bloodshed. “This is not Weliweriya, but Kolonnawa. We do not shoot at anybody. I came to know there had been certain incidents near the Kolonnawa tank gate as some persons were not allowed to go in. The Police have used tear gas at that instance,” the Premier said.
