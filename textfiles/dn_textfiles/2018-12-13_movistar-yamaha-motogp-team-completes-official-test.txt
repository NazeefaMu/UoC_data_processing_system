Movistar Yamaha MotoGP team completes official test

The Movistar Yamaha MotoGP Team have completed the Jerez MotoGP official test, at the last riding day of 2018. Continuing their testing schedule, Maverick Viñales and Valentino Rossi spent the allotted time making a final assessment of the new engine specs, setting the 3rd and 11th fastest time of the day respectively.
Viñales session at the Circuito de Jerez - Ángel Nieto to the full, as he was keen to make a final decision on the new engine spec. The Spaniard mainly focused on race pace again, riding a total of 78 laps, mostly with used tyres. As the session progressed, so did his efforts. When he decided to push hard on a flying lap, he set a 1’38.066s. This hot lap earned him third place in the Day 2 results and fourth place in the combined timesheets, 0.121s from first. Rossi also had a productive day at the office, finding a better feeling and pace than he had the day before. The Italian had already shared that he would be taking an in-depth look at the data to make a decision on the engine spec. After a total of 67 laps today, he has come to a clear decision on which direction to work in. His best lap, a 1’38.596s put him in 11th position in both the Day 2 and the combined results, 0.651s from the top.
The Movistar Yamaha MotoGP Team have now completed all 2018 riding action. The next test will be held after the winter break, at the Sepang International Circuit, early February.
