Fuel prices increased

Fuel prices have been increased with effect from midnight yesterday. Accordingly, a litre of 92 Octane Petrol has been increased from Rs.117 to Rs.137, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
“A litre of 95 Octane Petrol has been increased to Rs.148 from Rs.128. A litre of Auto Diesel has been increased to Rs.109 from Rs.95 while Super Diesel was increased to Rs.119 from Rs.110,” the Minister said.
The price of a litre of Kerosene was also revised to Rs.101 from Rs.44 resulting in a Rs.57 increase. However, Minister Senaratne said the reason for the price increase was a result of some drivers mixing kerosene with petrol. The minister further said that the prices would be the same for the fishing community.
“The fishing community will be issued coupons like on previous occasions to provide the same price for Kerosene before the revision,” the minister stated.
The LIOC has also increased fuel prices from yesterday.
