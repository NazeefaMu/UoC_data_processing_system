Constrictions in the Korean Dream
Shadow veiling stride to success

Sumith Prasanna Bandara Koswatte came from a middle-income family. His father was an electrician and so was his brother—it was their family business. But having done his A/L exams, Koswatte was not satisfied with having to join their electrical shop in Matale.
At age 25, he was running out of options; he had a vocational training certificate and was a qualified electrician, but he could not find work at any established company. It was then that he learnt that the government had called for applications for those seeking jobs in South Korea. Similar to many men his age, he applied with hopes of going to South Korea.
“He got chosen the first time he applied. Many apply several times, but my son was smart,” said his mother, Badra Koswatte. Her son died early this year of lung cancer. He was 33 years old and a father of a three-year-old boy.
Long hours and harsh conditions

According to medical reports, Koswatte had been diagnosed with lung cancer. His mother said that he was in perfect health when he left to South Korea in 2009. She was not wrong; according to the Employment Permit System (EPS) scheme, all foreign workers need to pass a medical examination before they are chosen to be in the database for employment.
“The doctor who examined him said it might have developed due to his work there,” she said.
Koswatte, who had applied to work in the manufacturing industry, had worked at a paint factory initially and then was transferred to a gear box-manufacturing company as a result of the strong chemicals used in the paint factory.
“He said the chemicals were too strong; he could not continue to work there. Then he moved to the gear box place, but even there, he was exposed to dangerous residues. He told me that even though they wore masks, when they washed their faces at night, they could still feel iron dust on their faces,” she added.
Living and working conditions for Koswatte were no better. He shared a converted container space with four to five other workers and more often than not, they would work 12-hour days to earn extra money through overtime payments.
A Korean employment contract lasts a maximum of four years and 10 months and the end of it, Koswatte was back home. He had sent enough money home to build himself a house and save up to start a family. In 2015, he got married and had a son. One and a half years after his return, as Koswatte was working on setting up his own electrical work practice, he was diagnosed with cancer.
Korea a paradise for workers?
According to a Financial Times report in December, 2017 (https://www.ft.com/content/57c76820-d3f0-11e7-8c9a-d9c0a5c8d5c9), South Korea has one of the “highest industrial death rates in the developed world, and a culture of covering up accidents, say lawmakers, workers and experts.”
The occupational fatality rate was 10.1 deaths per 100,000 employees—among the highest in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)—in 2015. But South Korea’s overall industrial accident rate was just reported to be 0.49 per 100 workers—this has led to speculation that companies were covering up such incidents to avoid increased insurance payments and damage to their brands.
The article, which highlights the case of a worker at the Hankook Tire Factory—one of the largest in the country—said many workers had succumbed to occupational diseases such as lung cancer and cardiovascular disease.
“Yet only four workers had been officially recognised and compensated by the company due to difficulties in proving a direct causal link between their work conditions and illnesses. An examination of 4,500 Hankook Tire workers discovered that about half the workforce should be considered patients—or were likely to become ill soon—according to a 2010 study by the ministry.”
The story of the worker at Hankook is no different from Koswatte. Whilst Badra Koswatte too knows that her son was diagnosed with cancer after having worked in the factories in South Korea, she has little means or ability to technically prove this causal link.
For one year and five months, she took her son from hospital to hospital and finally to the Maharagama Cancer Hospital where he died.
“There were 120 boys in his batch. I heard two others also got lung cancer, but how do we prove it?” she queried.
One among many
According to research conducted by Kelaniya University student Ishani Wijesooriya in 2017 on Sri Lankan Labour Migration to South Korea, since the 1990s, there has been an increasing preference for Sri Lankan migrants to South Korea. The majority of those seeking work were men between the ages of 20 to 30 in the labour category, and the main driving factor was that Korea offered better wages and employment.

Having interviewed 50 Sri Lankans working in South Korea, her data showed that 34 of them reported ‘difficult working conditions’ (68 percent) and 17 of them (34 percent) said they had been in industrial accidents. However, a majority of those interviewed said they were satisfied with their lives and salaries in Korea.
For foreign migrants who move to South Korea looking for work, ‘difficult working conditions’ are not new. According to official Korean statistics, there were 360,000 migrant workers in South Korea in 2006, making up 1.5 percent of the total workforce. By May, 2017, those numbers had declined to 260,000 as public perception of foreign workers in South Korea had worsened, as reflected in a poll released early this year.
Korea had allowed foreign migrants to enter as low-skilled labourers to work at 3Ds industries; ‘Dirty, Dangerous and Demeaning’. These were the jobs South Koreans themselves did not want to do.
According to a 2006 Amnesty International study, with South Korea implementing the EPS Act that came in 2004, it became the “first labour-importing country in Asia to attempt to protect the rights of migrant workers through legislation.”
The EPS Act prohibits discrimination against foreign workers (Article 22).(57). It also recognises their right to have access to a system of redress against employers in cases of overdue wages and industrial accidents and also to national health insurance.
The report, however, noted that at the time, the EPS had little impact on health and safety at work for migrant workers, “Under safety rules, all employers are obliged to conduct monthly medical check-ups for their staff and to check the safety of their machines. However, Amnesty International’s research suggests that very few companies conduct such checks and that migrant workers continue to be exposed to industrial hazards such as dangerous chemicals, with little protection.”
Further, under the EPS, migrant workers found it difficult to change jobs even when they suffered from health complications or human rights violations in a particular workplace, unless they had officially reported their ill-health or abuse, said Amnesty.
Since the Amnesty report, reporting and monitoring mechanisms in South Korea had received wide attention, but the question of sending Sri Lankan workers to work at dirty industries still remain. For those like Koswatte, the impacts of working in such environments was not immediately apparent, but under the system, does Sri Lanka really have a choice?
Still the better option
Despite the issues, for sending countries like Sri Lanka, South Korea is a far better option than other countries; for example the Middle East.
In Telecommunication, Digital Infrastructure and Foreign Employment Minister Harin Fernando’s view, workers sent to South Korea were treated well and if there were cases of cancer in some, it was isolated and unrelated; “I have not heard of any problems from South Korea,” he said.
Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment's (SLBFE's) Approval and Recruitment Deputy General Manager D. P. P. Senanayake, in an interview with the Daily News, said Sri Lanka was one of the 16 countries to be chosen to send workers to South Korea under a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed between the two respective governments.
Workers recruited under the E9 visa category receive an initial contract of three years, and if the employer wishes, it could be extended up to four years and 10 months.
“On reasonable grounds, a worker, with permission from the Labour office there, can change employers thrice during the contract period. If a worker who gets there finds out that another company pays better, it would not be a justifiable reason to change employers,” said Senanayake.
If a worker had worked for four years and 10 months for the same employer, once again with the permission of the Labour office in Korea, the employer could request for the same person on a new contract; “They are called committed workers. This is to encourage people to stick to one employer.”
Sri Lanka is the only country out of 16 to be given the opportunity to send workers under three categories. They are; manufacturing, fisheries and construction. Senanayake said Sri Lankan workers dominated the manufacturing sector there due to their skills being more preferred.
The whole selection system comes under a computerised EPS TOPIK Point System which holds an examination to test the workers for their language proficiency, skills and competency.
“We are informed by the Human Resource Development Service (HRDS) of Korea regarding the issuance of admittance of applicants. We have a network of offices and we in turn call for applications. Another rule recently introduced is that those who had gone on the E9 and E10 visa previously and stayed for more than five years, are not qualified for admissions,” he added.
HRDS Korea decides the quota of workers allowed from every country each year, based on their local requirements.
“The number of passes has no connection with the number they require. They select extra so they have a pool to select from, by their employers. This year, they may have passed more than last year, but that does not mean they would recruit more than last year. This is for roster requirements,” he said.
The workers marked out of 200 score differently according to sector. Manufacturing for example, scores language proficiency out of 100, whilst construction and fisheries score the same out of 90. Meanwhile, fisheries and construction score higher for skills (out of 110), whilst manufacturing requires a score out of 110—logic being you need more skills for fisheries and construction.
Employers in South Korea then could approach a job centre there and request for workers based on their nationality, weight and height, and they would be given a selection of workers based on such criteria. Employers cannot choose based on a worker’s identity.
“Just because you pass the exam, there is no guarantee that you would be selected. There are workers who have been in the system for two years and are still not selected. Eventually, the system automatically deletes them from the database,” said Senanayake.
The SLBFE officer, who had spent three years at the Sri Lankan Embassy in South Korea, however noted that the country was still the preferred destination for many Sri Lankans and there was a huge demand for it; many could earn between USD 1,500 to 2,000 per month, despite the work not being ‘easy’. Today, Sri Lanka ranks fifth among the 16 in sending workers to Korea.
High-risk jobs
He explained that schemes such as the Korea Workers' Compensation and Welfare Service and insurance for industrial accidents protected the workers there. In the event of a death or accident, the family of the worker would receive compensation. Further, the Korea National Pension Service Scheme was also extended for foreigners who have worked for four years and 10 months.
The workers, according to Senanayake, were informed of these schemes during their pre-departure training and orientation; three days after arrival in South Korea. Further, they were also informed of a hotline to contact if any issues were to arise; “The worker can speak to a person in their own language, so they are free to complain.”
He said the Sri Lankan Embassy there checked workplaces in order to ascertain whether there were any complaints regarding their Labour Office, but workers often complained to have not understood safety measures.
“We have systems. Workers select their preferred sector, no one forces them to. If they do not want to, they can come back. Working in the industry sector means you have to deal with chemicals and machines, you cannot refuse to work with them,” Senanayake said.
“In our experience, we know that Korea is the safest country, compared to our other receiving countries,” he added.
Role of the SLBFE
The SLBFE has a difficult balance to maintain often, between the welfare of the workers and ensuring that South Korea is happy so that they would recruit more of our workers. When asked what the role of the SLBFE was, Senanayake said it was to promote the sending of foreign workers, adding that he was simply catering to the demands of Sri Lankans who aspired for the Korean Dream.
“The balance needs to be there, we can’t lose the market,” Senanayake said.
In 2011, 5,349 workers were sent to South Korea across all sectors, but by 2017, the number had dropped to 3,439. The main reason being that the fisheries sector, which had the second highest sending rate, also had the highest runaway rate; “More than 90 percent of those who went for fisheries ran away in 2016.”
“Fisheries is tougher than manufacturing and earlier, they only looked at the language proficiency of those who applied. But we explained that it was better to also give them fisheries training, so we commenced a course on it. At present, the runaway rate has significantly declined, but the issue was that it created a bad impression about our workers.”
As fisheries had a lower pass mark than the rest, most Sri Lankans had chosen that sector to work in, and they were not necessarily fishermen. Senanayake, however, said they expected their yearly quota to recover by this year.
“People want to go to Korea somehow. They don’t bother if it is fisheries, construction or whatever. Once they go there, they think they can runaway and work elsewhere,” he said.
In a bid to win the confidence of South Korea further, the SLBFE, during the last few years, had also taken steps to curb the number of illegal Sri Lankan migrants in South Korea. The introduction of a bond for all those who go to Korea to minimise runaway rates and instituting legal action against those who do not keep to their contract, have had a positive impact, Senanayake said.
He said, “We were praised by the Korean Government when President Maithripala Sirisena visited South Korea last year. With that they increased our quota for manufacturing by 1,200.”
Senanayake added that sending workers to Korea might not always be feasible, especially with increasing youth unemployment there; “Last year, there was a plan to introduce a special tax on companies that hired foreigners, but due to resistance from companies, they had withdrawn that. So we cannot always expect this trend to continue.”
When asked whether it was time we ourselves should look at taking measures to ensure that our own workers were not exposed to dangerous working conditions, he said that they had done their best to voice concerns at various times, but given that we were sending country, our powers were limited,
Senanayake said, “We can’t protest. It is a preferable destination for everyone. This is a comparative thing. If we don’t send, someone else will, or they themselves will find a way to get there.”
Sri Lanka had also requested that Korea open up the agriculture sector for workers, to increase sending numbers.
