NPC asks to appoint ministerial board to handle CM’s powers

The Northern Provincial Council (NPC) yesterday adopted a resolution that Province Governor should appoint a ministerial board to exercise the powers of the Northern Province Chief Minister C. V. Vigneswaran
The Northern Provincial members at a special session adopted the resolution in the backdrop of interim order issued by the Court of Appeal preventing the decision of Chief Minister C.V. Vigneswaran to expel B. Denishwaran from functioning as the Fisheries and Transport Minister in the Province.
However, Chief Minister Vignewaran and a number of councillors and Ministers did not attend. Vigneswaran had informed the council that he would not participate in the special session as case is going on before the Court of Appeal over his decision to expel B. Denishwaran from functioning as the Fisheries and Transport Minister in the province. Petitioner B. Denishwaran had challenged Chief Minister C.V. Vigneswaran in the Court of Appeal, complaining that the Chief Minister had no power to appoint or remove any Provincial Council Minister.
The petitioner cited Chief Minister Vigneswaran, K.Sarveswaran, Ananthi Sasitharan, G. Gunaseelan, K.Sivanesan and P. Sathyalingam and Governor Reginald Cooray as respondents.
