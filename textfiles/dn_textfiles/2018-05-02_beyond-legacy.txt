Beyond the legacy

Lester’s talent was not to be wasted on documentaries and he soon grew bored with the subject. He was a person who recognised the pulse of the public and strived to make his own mark in a society that was used to viewing films with some Indian influence
Traversing through the winding path of destiny he reached the zenith of glory. The contented but unexhausted traveller who devoted his life to change the line of destiny of the Sinhala cinema passed away on April 29 at the age of 99 while receiving treatments at a private Hospital in Colombo.
Considered as the father of Sinhala cinema, Dr Lester James Peries was also the longest living filmmaker in the world. With a career spanning more than 50 years the iconic filmmaker revolutionized the Sinhala film industry with his globally acclaimed film ‘Rekava’ in 1956. ‘Rekava’ was the first Ceylonese movie to be shot outdoors. It was nominated for the Palme d’Or at the 1957 Cannes Film Festival.
An internationally acclaimed film director, screenwriter, and film producer, Dr Peries was involved in over 28 films including shorts and documentaries. He was not only a national treasure but was also one of the biggest brand names in the cinema world. The reason for this was that he was more highly regarded abroad than in his native country.
With a career spanning more than 50 years Dr Peries has made what his friend and companion Lindsay Anderson as “works of Chekhovian grace”. Some of his noteworthy productions are Delovak Athara (Between Two Worlds), Golu Hadawatha (Cold Heart), Akkara Paha (Five Acres of land), Nidhanaya (The Treasure), The God King, Madol Doowa (Enchanted Island), Beddegama (Village in the jungle) Kaliugaya (The Time of Kali), Yuganthaya (The Changing Village), Avaragira (The Sunset), Wekanda Walauwa (The mansion by the lake) and many more. His last film was Ammavarune (An Elegy for a Mother) which was screened in 2006.
Lester was born on April 5, 1919, to a family of four children. His parents were Dr. James Francis Peries and Ann Gertrude Winifred Jayasuriya. He was an old boy of St. Peter’s College, Colombo. Though his parents wished him to enter priesthood the youth’s passion for theatre and films carved his destiny.
He started his career as a journalist at the Daily News and joined the Times of Ceylon working under Frank Moraes in 1939. In 1947 Lester travelled to England to join his brother, Ivan, who was there on an art scholarship.
During these six years abroad his interest in films developed. He was committed to his passion. Having joined the Government Film Unit of Ceylon as an assistant director, he worked under the distinguished English documentary filmmaker Ralph Keene.
He made a number of documentaries like ‘Heritage of Lanka’ and ‘Nelungama’. He also directed ‘Conquest in the Dry Zone’; a documentary based on controlling malaria and ‘Be safe or be sorry’, a witty study on errant motorists.
Lester’s talent was not to be wasted on documentaries and he soon grew bored with the subject. He was a person who recognised the pulse of the public and strived to make his own mark in a society that was used to viewing films with some Indian influence.
Rekhava was released in 1956 and it marked a watershed in Sri Lankan cinema. He released his second film Sandeshaya (The Message) in 1960. His third creation Gamperaliya screened in 1964 was instantly recognised as a superior work of cinematic art and won the Grand Prix (Golden Peacock) at the International Film Festival of India in New Delhi.
The iconic filmmaker has made two attempts at reaching for a wider international audience. The first is a British co-production named The God King (1974), starring Oliver Tobias and Leigh Lawson was set in fifth-century Ceylon. It related a colourful but bloody story. It proved a fraught production despite a comparatively large budget. He fared better with a 1980 adaptation of Leonard Woolf’s novel ‘Village in the Jungle’, which was stunningly captured by his long-term collaborator Willie Blake.
Lester’s Wekande Walauwa, starring Ravindra Randeniya and Malani Fonseka, was Sri Lanka’s first ever submission for the Academy Awards.
Lester was married to the equally renowned film directress Sumitra Peries nee Gunewardena since 1964. Taking a cue from her husband Sumitra also shares a passion for movie making and has made her mark in the cinematic scene with her own unique style in making movies.
Lester had introduced many artistes who went on to make big names in the industry. He worked with cinematographer Willie Blake and film editor Titus Totawatte in Rekava. Veteran actor Iranganie Serasinghe acted in one of his documentaries, Parissam Venna Nethnam Kanagatu Venna (Be safe or be sorry) before taking up a role in Rekava.
Film legend Gamini Fonseka joined the Rekava team as a technician and later went on to take the second lead in Sandeshaya. K.A.W. Perera, the renowned filmmaker composed the dialogues for the film while Rev. Fr. Marcelline Jayakody penned the lyrics.
Well known musician Sunil Shantha set the melodies and Indrani Wijebandara and Ivor Dennis contributed as playback singers to Rekava. Lester also worked with many well loved artistes of the golden era like Jeevarani Kukurulasuriya in Sandeshaya and Tony Ranasinghe, Anula Karunathilaka, Trilicia Gunawardena, Wickrama Bogoda and G.W. Surendra in Gamperaliya. Veteran journalist and film critic Regi Siriwardena wrote the screenplay of Gamperaliya and renowned media personality Tissa Abeysekara was the additional screenplay writer for the film.
The key behind Lester’s creations is his loyalty and dedication to his work. The essence of his creations is often derived from local families in rural settings. His journey to the top was difficult but his unwavering confidence succeeded in bringing the Sri Lankan cinema to the main cultural stream.
He has received countless honours and lifetime achievement awards. The road in which his house had been was renamed after him. On his birthday in 2002 a million 3.50 rupee stamps were struck in his honour. A book, Lester by Lester – as told to Kumar de Silva, was published in 2007.
