Kandy Sports Round up:
CH to suffer another blow on Sunday?

Kandy Sports Club who have claimed the upper hand in club rugby head into their fifth game of the first round tomorrow at Nittawela against the sixth placed CH & FC, which will be a win or go home scenario. CH and FC in four games have won one and lost three and their chances of advancing to wins, after losing three games is definitely not part of their game plan. The team needs Lady Luck to help them build to make sure they are in the top three of the first round. Table leaders Kandy SC have won all four games they have played. Last Sunday's victory over CR & FC at the same venue was a confidence booster in the context. Sunday’s game against CH they should win comfortably to give themselves a chance of finishing first in the standings. That finish would ensure that they take some momentum and confidence into the remaining two games in the first round.
Five ruggerites from Kandy
There are five rugegrites from Kandy’s Trinity, Kingswood and St. Anthony’s College in the 26-member under 19 squad, who are now in Chinese Taipei to play in the Asian rugby championship, which is the qualifier for the World Cup to be held in Brazil in 2019. The Trinitians in the squad are Pravenda Wijetilake and Visha Ranaraja, the Kingswoodian is Rashmika Ganithagedera, and the Antonians are Ishara Liyanage and Shabeer Iqbal.
Athletics
The early history of Kandy athletics is lost in the midst of time. Records are unavailable and people associated with early years are long since dead. Almost up to 1925 athletics as such, was not given much importance as it is today nor did our athletes be interested. Today athletics has a special place in schools and recently in Kandy many athletic events were held. Schools have good coaches, Trinity is coached by a well known sportsman, H. Gamage Ariyaratne who polished his sports at Vidyartha College. He was also a top ruggerite. Walal A Ratnayake Central is doing well at athletics, followed by St. Anthony’s, Dharmaraja, Sri Sumangala, St.Sylvester’s, Kingswood, Girls High School, Mahamaya Girls School, Hillwood Girls College, Hemali BV, Swarnamali BV, Seethadevi BV, Viharamadevi BV, Kandy Convent, D.S. Senanayake, Nugawela Central, Madina Central, Berverets College, Chandananda Buddhist College, Ranabima Royal. Then the International schools Gateway, CIS, Sussex College to name a few. What they lack today is a proper ground with a good track. Kandy District Athletic Association are doing their best with limited facilities. The Sports Ministry should come forward and help.
