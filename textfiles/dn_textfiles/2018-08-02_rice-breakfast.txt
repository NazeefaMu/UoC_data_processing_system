Rice to breakfast!

It is vital to get your children in the habit of eating a healthy breakfast. Breakfast is the “most important meal of the day”. Studies show that children who have breakfast tend to eat healthier overall and are more likely to participate in physical activities which helps in maintaining a healthy body weight. Breakfast gives the body the refueling it needs for the day ahead after going without food for eight to 10 hours during sleep.
Having breakfast is important for everyone especially for children. In general, children who skip breakfast will feel tired, restless and irritable. What they have for breakfast is equally important as well. Choosing breakfast foods that are rich in whole grains, fiber and protein while low in added sugar may enhance the attention span, concentration and memory—which children need to learn in school.
Children who eat a healthful, well-balanced breakfast are more likely to:
*Meet their daily nutrient requirements
*Concentrate better
*Have better problem-solving skills
*Have better hand-eye coordination
*Stay alert
*Be more creative
*Miss fewer days of school
*Be more physically active
 
Without breakfast, our bodies don’t get the proper start they need to operate at their fullest potential throughout the day. Encourage your children to make breakfast a part of their regular household routines. By helping children learn important concepts about eating breakfast, it will lay a foundation of eating right for years to come.
