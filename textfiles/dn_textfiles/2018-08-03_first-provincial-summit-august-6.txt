Parliament Committee on National and Religious Reconciliation
First provincial summit on August 6

The first provincial summit of the Parliament Committee on National and Religious Reconciliation will be held at the Mahaweli Reach Hotel in Kandy from 9.30 am to 2.30 pm on August 6.
The event, organised by Parliament, under the patronage of Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, will be participated by the representatives of all communities, religious clergy, politicians and scholars.
The decisions taken at this summit would be of great importance for reconciliation among communities, sources said.
The sources said the next provincial summit will be held in Ampara. In the future, the public too would be able to submit their views on the matter before the committee in writing or orally.
