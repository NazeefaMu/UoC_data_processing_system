Watermelon wonders

1) Promotes Hair Growth
Arginine (an amino acid) is essential in our bodies and helps with blood circulation in the scalp. Watermelon naturally contains a lot of citrulline that increases the level of arginine and is therefore good for promoting hair growth.
2) Prevents Hair Loss
Watermelon is packed with Vitamin C, which helps your body to use non-heme iron – this ensures that enough iron is in your red blood cells to assist in carrying oxygen to your hair follicles, promoting healthy hair. Collagen is also needed for healthy hair growth and watermelon helps promote collagen formation.
3) Moisturises Hair
Watermelon Seed Oil is a very light oil, which helps to moisturise and works very well in watermelon shampoo.
4) Hydrates Skin
Dehydrated skin can lead to a dull and dry appearance, but watermelon has such a high water content that it helps to keep the skin hydrated and moisturised. This can help to keep your skin supple and looking great.
5) Acts As A Skin Toner
Watermelon contains a natural substance that helps to shrink body tissues. This essentially means that watermelon is a natural toner that can help to refresh the skin.
6) Prevents Skin From Ageing
As we get older our skin becomes thinner and less able to recover from damage. Our body is full of ‘free radicals’ that damage cells over time and can attributed to the cause of aging skin. Watermelon is full of antioxidants such as lycopene and also vitamin C and A which helps reduce these free radicals that can slow down the signs of ageing. The consumption of Vitamin A can encourage growth of collagen and elastin cells that helps your skin stay young and supple.
7) Prevents Oil Production In Skin
Sebaceous glands secrete oil that can be troublesome for keeping skin clear. Watermelon is packed with Vitamin A, reducing skin pore size and the amount of oil that your sebaceous glands secrete. Watermelon is believed to help with acne due to this these properties.
