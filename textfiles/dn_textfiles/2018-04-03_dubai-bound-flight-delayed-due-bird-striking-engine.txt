Dubai-bound flight delayed due to bird striking engine

A Fly Dubai FZ 551 flight carrying a complement of 113 passengers enroute to Dubai from the Katunayake BIA had to be grounded at the Mattala Airport around 7.11 am yesterday as a bird had struck its engine on the left side.
Sources said the bird had struck the engine as the plane was trying to land at Mattala to take in another 55 Dubai-bound passengers.
Twenty passengers who had travelled to Sri Lanka from Dubai in the plane disembarked at Mattala and went on their journey, while the 113 passengers enroute to Dubai and the other 55 passengers awaiting to board the plane had to languish at Mattala for a long period until the plane was declared fit for take off after a checkup by an aircraft engineer.
An airport officer said when the plane engine is struck by a bird, it had to await clearance by an engineer for take off. Although an aircraft engineer was summoned from Colombo for the checkup and issue clearance, he had not arrived at Mattala till 1 pm yesterday.
