Tightrope wedding

A couple in eastern Germany have gotten married in a swing dangling from a motorcycle atop a tightrope, 14 meters above the ground.
The German news agency dpa reported that a pastor standing in a cage atop a fire service ladder presided over the wedding of Nicole Backhaus and Jens Knorr in the town of Stassfurt recently.
The couple exchanged rings in the air but, for safety’s sake, waited until they were back on the ground to kiss.
More than 3,000 people watched the wedding in the sky, which took place during a local festival.
The tightrope was stretched between the town wall and a tower, and the motorbike was ridden by Falko Traber, a member of a family of artists. AP
