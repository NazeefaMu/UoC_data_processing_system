Negotiations for few joint ventures also took place during the exhibition.
The Business Forum and B2B networking session comprised a large number of businessmen, traders, importers, buyers, chairmen and presidents of leading organizations based in Karachi. High Commissioner of Sri Lanka in Islamabad was the Chief Guest of the Forum. Chairperson and Chief Executive of EDB, Director General of Sri Lanka Tea Board and Chairman of National Gem and Jewellery Authority of Sri Lanka, Commercial Secretary of Pakistan High Commission in Colombo and President, Sri Lanka Pakistan Business Council participated in these meetings.
The Sri Lankan delegation made fruitful contacts with their Pakistani counterparts and the feedback confirms that the participation of the delegation was a great success.
Chairperson and CE of the EDB and Director General, Sri Lanka Tea Board had discussions with the Secretary and higher officials of the TDAP to look into the avenues for Sri Lanka to regain the lost tea market in Pakistan.
Other potential areas for mutual collaboration such as construction industry, gems and jewellery and textiles were also discussed to reach the goal of US$ 1 billion trade between the two countries.
Another meeting was also held between the Sri Lankan government delegation including Chairman, National Gems and Jewellery Authority with Pakistani counterparts where discussions focused on skill development, technology transfers, quality and marketing of products between the countries and the mutual collaboration for cutting edge technology and sourcing of products.
The signing of an MOU between the National Gems and Jewellery Authority of Sri Lankan and the Pakistan Gems and Jewellery Development Company was also discussed.
The exploration of the Pakistani market was initiated with the 'Export Opportunities in the Pakistan Market' seminar organized by the EDB for the Sri Lankan exporters in July this year followed with a market study on potential Sri Lankan products in Pakistan. The comprehensive report on this study is expected this month and information dissemination seminar will also be organized by the EDB for the benefit of the Sri Lankan exporters.
It is important to explore market opportunities by testing non-traditional products as done at the Expo this year in these neighbouring markets where a similar kind of product basket is available for export with common resources. Non-competing products enjoy duty concessions under FTAs between the countries and have less trade restrictions than for competing products.
