The story takes place within the contours of a rented apartment of a middle class family depending solely on the income of Gregory who is a travelling salesman for a pharmaceutical company. Gregory bears the bulk of the financial responsibilities for the rent of the apartment, the violin lessons for his sister, and the general upkeep of the family. One fine morning Gregory wakes up to find himself transformed into a giant insect.
