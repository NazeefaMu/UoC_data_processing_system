Written in love

“You’re so beautiful,’ his voice intruded on her self-inspection, rought and with a depth of feeling that made it sound like a caress. A thousand fingers barely touching her skin, running down from the nape of her neck over every bump and groove of her spine to the small of her back, sending a delicious shiver through her.
Almost as soon as Devika Fernando could write, she imagined stories and poems. After finishing her education in Germany and returning to her roots in Sri Lanka, she got a chance to turn her passion into her profession. Having lived in Germany and in Sri Lanka with her husband has made her experience the best (and the worst) of two totally different worlds – something that influences her writing. Her trademark is writing sweet, yet deeply emotional romance stories where the characters actually fall in love instead of merely falling in lust. She draws inspiration from everyone and everything in life.
What she loves most about being an author is creating new worlds and sending her protagonists on a journey with ups and downs that leaves them changed. When she’s not writing, she’s reading or thinking about writing. Some of her contemporary and paranormal romance novels are bestsellers on Amazon.
Romance is not every novelist’s cup of tea. Most fiction-smiths toy with everything else that at times seems cerebral to the ordinary readership. Whether the literati like the idea or not, the romance genre hardly gathers dust. And in Sri Lanka, the genre is privileged with being sold like hotcakes.
Devika Fernando has captured that reality. She has written a number of romance novels and seems a maverick marketer on the cybersphere. And today, on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, she has earned quite an audience for her books.
We have oftentimes heard that the Sri Lankan English authors do not enjoy a flourishing market either at home or abroad. Fortunately, however, a few writers prove an exception to the rule. Shyam Selvadurai and Romesh Gunasekara are some of the Sri Lankan English authors who earned recognition on the global platform. But they are no longer domiciled in Sri Lanka.
No profits

Most Sri Lankan English authors thrive on their job with a handsome day job in hand, and they expect no profits in return.
“I made it a point to start ‘networking’ as soon as I knew I wanted to publish my first book. That involved connecting with other authors on Facebook and Twitter as well as following people who are avid readers, reviewers and bloggers. I made it a point to reach out to Indians because our neighbour seems to be a lot more open to and enthusiastic about literature in English. I also approached and interacted with Americans as they are the main customers of online stores like Amazon. Over time, I grew my friendship and readership circle to countries all around the globe. It’s what I love about books: they bring people together, bridge gaps and form bonds—especially if they’re written in English,” Fernando notes.
Sri Lanka could have a flourishing literature scene if we just encourage and sponsor the right people, especially the younger generation, Devika believes. Her story was different as she chose to self-publish all of her books and reach an international audience online. The internet has a way of removing geographical boundaries, the author adds.
Devika Fernando is also a German citizen despite her roots in Sri Lanka. Her novels are woven around various countries with Sri Lanka well included.
“I admire the Sri Lankan English writers. I wish their contribution to this country and to literature, in general, was recognised more.”
Many years ago, Devika discovered Michael Ondaatje. The Booker-acclaimed author paved the way for Devika to go in search of other writers. To date, The English Patient remains her favourite book. Although the other Sri Lankan English books are almost non-existent in bookstores abroad, Devika went in search of them in the Sri Lankan bookstores. That is how she familiarised the likes of Romesh Gunasekara, Shyam Selvadurai, Martin Wickramasinghe, Nihal de Silva, Ashok Ferrey and Jean Arasanayagam.
Tragic past
“I saw the country through their eyes, its beauty and tragic past, its struggle and its exotic warmth. I truly believe they should receive more international recognition like various Indian authors do. It’s encouraging to see emerging authors in the recent years, with their own voices and often also valuable contributions to competitions held for Commonwealth countries. I will have to check out Nayomi Munaweera, for example.”
As she writes romance, love in its myriad forms always lies at the heart of her books. She finds it fascinating how people discover themselves and learn to love themselves when they fall in love with someone else. A journey of self-discovery, if you want to call it that, at times combined with a physical journey to a different place. Her books also shine a light on various issues like domestic abuse (When I See Your Face), arranged marriage (Saved in Sri Lanka) and life as a single parent (Kaleidoscope of Hopes). Family always plays a central role as well, either the lack of a familial bond or the complicated ways in which it can influence our life choices.
“I find myself unable to write flawless or stereotypical characters or weak heroines who only swoon and simper. This isn’t what women are like, so why portray them like this when there is such a wealth of traits, quirks and qualities to explore? That being said, the chemistry of attraction and how it expresses itself is always a challenge and a treat to write. I make it a point not to restrict it to whatever may or may not happen between the sheets because romance is so much more than that.”
Romantic suspense
Devika is fond of romance with its various sub-genres very much. In fact, she prefers contemporary romance because it resonates with a wide audience and can throw up—as well as answer—so many questions. Romantic suspense and paranormal romance are full of possibilities, too. They are a great canvas to paint on if you strive for developed, authentic characters and a more complex plot.
What measures could be taken to uplift the Sri Lankan English literature as a market-friendly entity?
Devika brings out two main approaches. First, education needs to give literature a bigger place and greater value, especially contemporary literature in English. If you nurture a love for books in children, acknowledge and foster their talent, there are bound to be budding writers who could then go on to benefit from workshops and hone their skills. Events like the Colombo Book Fair and smaller events could be organised, with the main focus on English literature by national and international authors.
Or we could seek multinational promotions and team up with other Asian countries, hosting competitions and offering forums for discussion. And on the other hand, Sri Lankans should be familiarised with eBooks. So much here still depends on bookstores, printed copies and the huge cost that come with them.
“These days, everyone knows how to use a phone and access the internet. Why not utilize that as a foundation to promote eBooks, get more people interested in reading and also make it easier for authors to publish or self-publish their works?”
