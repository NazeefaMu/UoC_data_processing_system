MLTs to read for degrees

Opportunity will be provided for Medical Laboratory Technicians (MLTs) to read for a degree, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne stated. Minister Dr. Senaratne said the objective of the government is to create more international level MLTs by offering them opportunities to obtain higher education and training.
He was addressing the gathering after handing over diploma certificates to 144 MLTs during a ceremony at the BMICH in Colombo, recently.
Minister Dr. Senaratne said the medical laboratory services commenced in Sri Lanka in 1959 at the Medical Research Institute (MRI). Later, training centres opened in Colombo, Kalutara and Peradeniya. The Health Ministry had paid attention to offer duty leave for diploma holders to follow the degree on Medical Laboratory Technology conducted by the Open University, he said.
