Fourteen industrialists receive ISO 14001 today

Fourteen industrialists will receive ISO 14001 Certification today, Friday, December 28, at 9 am, at the Anthony D. Anjelo Auditorium - MILODA, the Academy of Finance Studies in Colombo 1.
The IDB has organised this half a day seminar with a view to encourage and facilitate small and medium enterprises(SMEs) in order to develop their standards which would enable them to receive ISO 14001 Certification through the promotion of cleaner production practices.
It is believed that these programmes would encourage industrialists island-wide to join the movement in order to change interactive methods between industries and the environment and also to reduce the negative impact from industries on the environment due to changes in industrial work patterns and the technology they use.
Industry and Commerce, Resettlement of Protracted Displaced Persons and Co-operative Development Minister Rishad Bathiudeen is scheduled to be the chief guest at the event.
Additional Secretary of the Industry and Commerce Ministry M. Thajudeen, Director of the Finance Ministry Rohan Jayathilake, Director General of the IDB P.L.U.Rathnamalala, Sri Lanka Standards Institution(SLSI) Director General, IDB Director K.M.S.G. Bandara, SLSI Director Samanthi Narangoda, National Cleaner Production Centre CEO Samantha Kumarasena, and SLSI DD Theruni Wijesuriya will be among invitees. The organisers expect participation of industrialists representing different industries countrywide in addition to their invitees.
Cleaner production is a broad concept that addresses all aspects of inputs, production and outputs. It can be defined as the continuous application of an integrated, preventive environmental strategy applied to processes, products and services to increase overall efficiency and reduce risks on humans and the environment.
Currently, there is a growing world movement among governments and industries to change the manner in which industries interact with the environment. The focus of this movement is to reduce the impact caused by industries on nature.
It is mandatory for SMEs to minimise waste which in turn would reduce harmful impact on the environment.
At the seminar and certificate awarding ceremony, 14 industrialists including three from Jaffna, representing different industries, will receive the ISO 14001 certification as an assurance to their company management while maintaining a clean environment. This will be an eye-opener and encouragement to other industrialists to be part of this growing world movement.
The ISO 14001 specifies the requirements for an environmental management system that an organisation can follow to enhance its environmental performance.
It assists an organisation to achieve the intended outcomes of its environmental management system, which protects the environment, the organisation itself and interested parties.
The project includes the following objectives:
1. To provide financial assistance to take remedial action or preventive measures to minimise waste of resources
2. To facilitate in obtaining ISO 14001:2015 and to facilitate SMEs to optimise the usage of resources through CP approaches certification for the industry.
Right now the IDB has registered SMIs operating in nine districts such as Ratnapura, Matara, Hambantota, Kandy, Batticaloa, Jaffna, Kurunegala, Kalutara and Gampaha.
