Laws to make life insurance compulsory for risky jobs

Laws will be introduced to make life insurance compulsory for all workers engaged in risky employments.
The compensation paid to the family on behalf of a deceased worker will be doubled, Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister W. D. J. Seneviratne said.
He said so at a discussion at his ministry with regard to recent deaths of workers attached to factories such as Bogala Mine, dhal factory etc. Last year, 246 factory workers died due to accidents.
According to Minister Seneviratne, the current Rs. 550,000 death compensation will be increased to Rs. 1.1 million. Several amendments will be brought to the Sri Lanka Factories Ordinance Number 45 of 1942 to ensure the safety of workers engaged in risky employments.
Minister Seneviratne said the Labour Department takes legal action against factory owners who violate the Sri Lanka Factories Ordinance Number 45 of 1942.
It is decided to recruit 100 more engineers to inspect risky factories. The current engineering team is not adequate to carry out inspections, the minister said.
It is also expected to create a new position entailing engineering knowledge to further strengthen and expand the inspection of risky factories, he added.
