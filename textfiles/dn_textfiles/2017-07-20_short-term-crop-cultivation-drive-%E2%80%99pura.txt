Short term crop cultivation drive in A’pura

The Anuradhapura District Agriculture Committee will accord top priority to a short term crop cultivation drive under cultivation wells.
There are around 20,000 cultivation wells in the district.
District Secretary RM Wanninayake has instructed agriculture and agrarian services development officials and divisional secretaries to launch cultivation well based emergency food crop cultivation programmes in view of continuing drought.
Steps are taken to grant a subsidy of Rs. 100,000 per well to renovate 2,000 cultivation wells.
The Presidential Secretariat has allocated Rs. 40 million for the food drive.
Farmers are provided seeds and planting material free.
