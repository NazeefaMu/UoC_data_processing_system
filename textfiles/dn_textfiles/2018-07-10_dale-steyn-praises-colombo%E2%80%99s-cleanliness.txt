Dale Steyn praises Colombo’s cleanliness

South African cricketer Dale Steyn praised the quality of the city of Colombo yesterday, during the current South African tour of Sri Lanka. He shared his views via a tweet yesterday:
“Super impressed with Colombo. Streets are clean, roads are good, parks are well looked after. Massive difference to when I first toured here in 2006. Great to see.” South Africa will face Sri Lanka in two test matches, five One-Day International matches (ODIs) as well as a twenty-over match.
