TUs hold discussion with Minister Samaraweera

The first round-table discussion between Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera and representatives of the Inland Revenue Trade Unions Joint Committee to resolve issues pertaining to the new Inland Revenue Bill ended on a positive note on Monday, a Ministry spokesman and TU representatives said.
The Government presented the new Inland Revenue Bill in Parliament on July 5. The Bill, among other things, introduces new income tax structure and aimed at closing loopholes in revenue collection.
However, the Trade Unions have expressed their concerns over the drastic changes proposed to the Inland Revenue Act.
Inland Revenue Trade Unions Joint Committee member Ajith Galhena told the Daily News that Minister Samaraweera acknowledging that the draft Bill contains problematic Clauses, requested the TUs to present their proposals in writing.
“He agreed to meet us again to discuss our proposals. We hope to submit our proposals in writing tomorrow,” he said.
“This Act is incapable of increasing revenue. It has scrapped the powers of our officers.
The TUs have filed two petitions against the new Bill. Our request to get an appointment with former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake to explain our concerns were repeatedly rejected.
“We are glad that the current minister is willing to discuss,” he said. Galhena said the TUs also brought to the attention of the minister that the delay in gazetting Amendments to give legal effect to budgetary proposals of 2016 and 2017 has led to a loss of revenue.
