China’s second  quarter growth meets  expectations at 6.7%

China’s economy grew at an annual pace of 6.7% in the three months to June, official data showed, meeting forecasts for the period. That marked a slight slowdown from a 6.8% expansion recorded in the previous quarter. The data comes as the government attempts to curb growing debt and as trade tensions with the US escalate.
The US raised the stakes in a trade war last week, listing another $200bn worth of Chinese goods to be hit by tariffs.
Chinese stock markets, which have struggled recently amid the escalating trade dispute between the US and China, traded down slightly on Monday.
“GDP growth eased on softer global trade and the tightening of financial policy since early 2018,” Oxford Economics said in a research note. It expects slow credit growth and softer real estate activity - along with the “intensifying trade conflict with the US” - to weigh on China’s growth in the second half of 2018.
The US slapped tariffs on $34bn of Chinese goods on 6 July, opening the way for a tit-for-tat trade war with the world’s second-largest economy.
China retaliated, saying the US had launched the “largest trade war in economic history”.
However, Tom Rafferty from the Economist Intelligence Unit said there were also worries about the strength of China’s domestic economy. BBC News
