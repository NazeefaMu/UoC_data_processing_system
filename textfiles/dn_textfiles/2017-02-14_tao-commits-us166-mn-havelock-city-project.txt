Tao commits US$166 mn for Havelock City project

The Shing Kwan Group headed by Founder S. P. Tao has commited a further US$166 mn to the Havelock City project.
Tao,Founder of the Shing Kwan Group, is a naturalised citizen of Singapore of Chinese origin with extensive worldwide business experience in the commodities, shipping and real estate sectors.
Tao first visited Sri Lanka in 1940 at age 24, when working with the China South West Transport unit in Rangoon, he was offered a choice of Sri Lanka, Singapore or Calcutta for an R&R break. He chose to come to Sri Lanka and left with a most favorable impression of the people and the country.
In 1958, he commenced his business association with Sri Lanka dealing in commodities with the Ceylon Food Commissioner's office.
In the 1970's, he assisted Sri Lanka to establish the Ceylon National Shipping Corporation when he sold one ship, “Lanka Rani”, on credit to the Shipping Corporation. He would later receive as payment in lieu, a 20% equity share in the Colombo Dockyard.
Tao's confidence in Sri Lanka has always been rooted in the potential of the country's geographical location as a vital maritime transshipment and distribution hub combinedwith the high literacy and ambition of its people.
Business ventures in Sri Lanka
In the 1990's, in response to Lee Kuan Yew's clarion call to Singaporean companies to venture beyond its shores,Tao re-visited Colombo to assist Keppel Corporation in its plan to acquire Colombo Dockyard. During this visit he was shown a piece of land at Echelon Square in the Colombo Fort area by his friend Baku Mahadeva and he built the Echelon Towers.
Tao acquired Overseas Realty (Ceylon), a listed Company on the Colombo Stock Exchange and owner of that piece of land. The World Trade Centre at Echelon Square was conceived and completed in 1996, the brainchild of a world class developer bringing together world class design architects and a world class contractor, built to the highest quality and standards that continues to withstand the test of time.
In 2005, another opportunity arose in Havelock City, an ambitious mega mixed- use development project, conceived and developed during the most volatile times.
At 100 years of age, he officiated at a Groundbreaking ceremony for the Havelock City commercial development after the successful completion of 450 residential apartments with ongoing development of a further 650 homes.
Tao has a deep-seated vision for Sri Lanka that secures a prosperous future for generations to come. He remains confident in Sri Lanka's pivotal role as an essential staging point in China's one road one belt strategy which will bring about transformative opportunities for the people of Sri Lanka, with their natural flair and skills in technology, to transition towards a service intensive economy and prosperity.
Latterly, especially amidst the apparent chaos in the Western world, Tao is even more resolute in his conviction in making long term investments in Sri Lanka for future generations of stakeholders.
Throughout his business career spanning some 80 years Tao has always maintained that in business there is no charity. Sri Lanka is poised for great success and prosperity.
