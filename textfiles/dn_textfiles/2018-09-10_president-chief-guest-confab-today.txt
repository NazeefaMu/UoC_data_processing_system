Cultivation of barren paddy land
President, chief guest at confab today

The National Farmer Convention on the Cultivation of Barren Paddy Fields in Sri Lanka will be held today under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena, at Ruhunu Magampura International Conference Hall.
According to the Ministry statistics, there are around 140,000 acres of barren paddy lands in the country and more than 114,000 acres of barren paddy fields can be effectively used for paddy cultivation.
The Agrarian Development Department (ADD) which is under the purview of the Agriculture Ministry has already taken measures cultivate 26,000 acres of barren paddy lands.
Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said that the Ministry has taken a firm decision to encourage the owners of barren paddy fields to cultivate the total extent of paddy lands in the 2018 Maha season.
If they fail to do that, the Ministry has decided to provide these paddy fields to the Sri Lanka Army, Civil Defence Force or youth who are willing to cultivate these lands.
“This decision will not affect the ownership of the land.
The ADD has already made the paddy fields owners aware this decision,” he added.
The Minister said 2018 Maha paddy harvest should increase since most of the districts will receive sufficient water from the Moragahakanda - Kalu Ganga project.
