Illegal diesel selling racket unearthed

The investigation unit of the Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminals in Kolonnawa has uncovered a racket where a group of workers employed by private bowser owners have sold diesel illegally, while earning a massive income.
The incident came to light yesterday when officers found at least 2,000 litres of diesel carefully hidden in three private bowsers.
The investigators have uncovered that a group of drivers and their assistants employed by private bowser owners have done the fraud while they were transporting diesel from the CPC storage unit at Peradeniya, Kandy to a privately owned power generation plant at Pallekelle.
Officers say the bowsers can transport 33,000 litres of diesel and the plant they transported fuel had a tank with a capacity of 500,000 litres.
The drivers and their assistants have siphoned off some of the fuel they transported and sold them to outside buyers, sources said.
Racket has been going on for a long time, the investigations revealed.
The investigations are continuing.
