Greater Kurunegala Water Supply and Sewerage Project
PM to vest project with people today

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will vest the Greater Kurunegala Water Supply and Sewerage Project with the people today.
The upgrade of the Kurunegala drinking water supply scheme was a long-standing requirement of the Kurunegala Municipal area and its suburbs.
This project was undertaken to provide quality solutions for the problems of drinking water and sanitation facilities for householders, government and private sector offices, schools, hospitals, tourist hotels, and the daily floating population which exceeds 100,000.
With rapid development, Kurunegala city became congested and the wastewater and sewage was channelled into the main municipal drains, as there was no systematic sewage management system.
Apart from that, most septic tanks in households are not up to standard and leak into the open. This led to contamination of Kurunegala Lake and most wells. For these reasons, a proper sewerage system was needed.
Under these circumstances, the Greater Kurunegala Water Supply and Sewerage Project, which consists of an integrated water supply and sewerage system, was carried out from 2014 to 2018 for Kurunegala and its suburbs.
The project aims to provide safe and adequate drinking water for people living in Kurunegala MC and its suburbs. The project will provide water for a floating population which exceeds 100,000, while facilitating about 45,000 in the city limits. The project will also facilitate the General Hospital in Kurunegala, with a 24-hour water supply.
It will also provide for the disposal of wastewater for 3,500 domestic and commercial institutions through a well-organised sewerage network.
The government is providing Rs. 3,200 million for the project and a loan of US$ 77.3 million from the Chinese government too has been obtained.
A new raw water plant with a capacity of 15,000m3 has been built close to Deduru Oya Reservoir in Bakmeegolla using the latest technology available, to transmit raw water up to 8.3km through transmission lines (500 mm DI) to the treatment plant in Kurunegala.
Two existing water treatment plants have been rehabilitated to produce 9,000 m3 of water per day. Thus, it is capable of generating 14,000m3 of clean drinking water per day.
The new reservoir has been constructed above the old water treatment plant to store 1,500m3 of treated water. Another new water tank has been constructed at Wehera (750m3) to serve the people in the area.
