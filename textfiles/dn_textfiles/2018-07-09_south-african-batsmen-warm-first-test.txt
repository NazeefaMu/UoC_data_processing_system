South African batsmen warm up for first Test

South African captain Faf du Plessis, senior batsman Hashim Amla and middle order bat Temba Bavuma struck half-centuries apiece as they warmed up for the two-Test series against Sri Lanka commencing at Galle on July 12.
The two-day warm-up match played at P Sara Oval ended in a draw with South Africans replying to the Board XIs first innings total of 287 scoring 338 tumbling from a strong position of 223-3 at one stage.
Missing out on runs on the placid track were South Africa’s opener Aiden Markram who was dismissed for a first ball duck by Lahiru Gamage and lower middle order batters Quinton de Kock and Theunis de Bruyn.
Du Plessis was most convincing against the Board XI spinners using his feet confidently to hit 13 fours and a six in his 95-ball knock of 79.
Earlier Amla struck 11 fours before retiring on 78 and having figured in a partnership of 77 with Bavuma whose half century off 103 balls comprised six fours and a six.
Spinners Wanindu Hasaranga and Test cricketer Dhananjaya de Silva caused some concern among the South African batting ranks capturing five wickets between them.
South Africa travel to Galle today for the first Test scheduled to begin on Thursday. - ST
