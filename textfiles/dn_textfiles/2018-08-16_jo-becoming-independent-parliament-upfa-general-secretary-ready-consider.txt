JO becoming independent in Parliament: UPFA General Secretary ready to consider

UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera yesterday said he is ready to consider if parliamentarians representing the Joint Opposition (JO) wish to be independent in Parliament.
He added that he will consider the request if they submit letters separately.
The minister was addressing the media after a ceremony held in Colombo, yesterday.
Minister Amaraweera said the United National Party and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party are working together for the betterment of the country despite differences in opinion between the two parties.
‘JO risks being unseated’
Public Representations Committee on Constitutional Reforms Chairman Lal Wijenayake yesterday said the UPFA General Secretary could unseat Joint Opposition members in Parliament as they have been elected to Parliament by UPFA votes.
If a parliamentarian representing a political party wishes to be independent in Parliament, the General Secretary of the relevant party has the authority to unseat him, Wijenayake said.
He was addressing a press conference in Colombo, yesterday.
Wijenayake said the UPFA General Secretary could request the Elections Commissioner to unseat them.
“According to our electoral system, people cast their votes first to the political party and later to the candidate of their choice.”
He said the Elections Commissioner will inform the Speaker and the relevant MPs that they have been unseated.
