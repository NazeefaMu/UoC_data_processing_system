50 Greatest Players in World Cup History

It was half-time in the 2010 World Cup semi-final between Spain and Germany. With the score reading 0-0, the players trudged off the pitch, heading to the dressing room in silence. No one said a word except for Carles Puyol.
The defender sought out his Barcelona teammate Xavi and the two were seen speaking animatedly as they headed to the dressing room. Puyol told him, nay, instructed him to do just one thing.
It was a move they had perfected at Barcelona. Spain coach Vicente Del Bosque gave them the go-ahead if there was an opening. David Villa was tasked with blocking Manuel Neuer. Gerard Pique and the others would provide the screen for Puyol’s run to ensure he was unmarked.
In the 72nd minute, Spain won a corner. Xavi spotted Puyol and crossed the ball with a perfect looping trajectory directed at the penalty spot. The ball seemed to be heading to Pique who had leapt into the air to head it home.
“Of course, I was going to head that cross. But at that moment I was overtaken by an aeroplane...” - Pique.
Sure enough, Puyol had made the run and launched himself into the air near the penalty spot. Unmarked.
It was the figurative “HULK SMASH!” moment that saw the centre-back make sweet contact with the ball as it sailed past Neuer - who had been too busy pushing Villa out of the way to get back into position.
In a team of technically gifted players that loved having the ball at their feet, Puyol was their warrior who used brute force to break down the wall that was Die Mannschaft - a team that had conceded just two goals prior to the semi-final.
Full time: German 0-1 Spain. Puyol had scored the all-important goal that took them to Spain’s first-ever World Cup final. To eventual glory.
Heck, the goal was so important in the history of the country that Puyol even got away with meeting the Spanish Queen wearing nothing but a towel around his waist when she came to the dressing room to congratulate the team as the rest of the squad chanted, “Puyi, Puyi!”
Spain had never really had any luck in FIFA World Cups. Their best finish prior to 2010 was fourth place back in 1950. La Furia Roja had reached the quarter-finals in some editions, while they had simply failed to qualify for many others.
And Puyol has known heartbreak with the Spanish national team.
He was a right-back in 2002 when Spain were effectively robbed of a semi-final place when two goals against South Korea had been ruled out. The co-hosts would eventually win in a penalty shootout to advance.
In 2006, he had moved to centre-back. But Franck Ribery, Patrick Vieira, and Zinedine Zidane had packed them off in the Round of 16 as France beat them 3-1. It wasn’t until Spain won Euro 2008 that the pressure started to mount on them to win the big one. Nicknamed Captain Caveman for his locks and all-around rugged looks, Puyol was a player who knew no pain. The man was stone cold in the face of pain. He has refused treatment for cuts to his face, only jogging to the touchline on the referee’s orders to get his scalp stapled without flinching even one bit before trying to get the referee’s attention to return to the pitch ASAP.
When he was once told by the physiotherapist that he had dislocated his elbow, his first response was: “You mean I won’t be able to play on Sunday?” The man was an embodiment of the never-say-die attitude that slowly rubbed off on his teammates.
His knee surgery towards the end of his career had prevented him from playing in Euro 2012 but he suffered in silence. He wasn’t one to make a fuss and distract his teammates.
What Puyol does best is he keeps everyone on their toes. If his teammates mucked about, he would be the first to chide them before ordering them to get on with the game. When Pique once gave him stick for having a go at him at 4-0 up with three minutes to go, all Puyol said was: “So what if it’s 4-0? Focus! I know you.”
2010 was make-or-break for Spain. Although he wasn’t the official captain, he was definitely a bonafide leader.
The oldest member of the squad (along with another veteran in Joan Capdevila), Puyol marshalled a defence that listened intently to every word he said.
That was the kind of man Spain needed to be world champions.
A no-nonsense centre-back who would take you by the scruff of the neck and drag you across the finish line - even if there was nobody else left in the race.
Puyol was the only player to score in that crucial semi-final. But he didn’t come up with the goods simply because it was a semi-final.
He made the difference because he treated every game like it is the final.
It’s why he is on our list of 50 Greatest World Cup Players. - sk
The World Cup final had been deadlocked for 115 long minutes when Fernando Torres tried to pump the ball into the box from the left flank. The ball wouldn’t reach the target, the night had taken a toll on the runners. But following some pinball activity at the edge of the area, Cesc Fabregas rolled the ball deftly into the path of Andres Iniesta.
You know what happens next.
Andres settled the deal. The Oranje would wallow in despair. The golden generation of Spain had painted the world red and at the heart of it was this little magician who popped up in pockets he would then transform into treasure troves using the modern form of footballing witchcraft.
One of the greatest players ever to have not won a Ballon d’Or, Iniesta typified the technical brilliance of the Spanish like no other. Save the superlatives, Andres Iniesta’s greatness can be best understood through knowing that Lionel Messi, the greatest footballer on the planet, turns to him in the face of adversity and asks him to come closer; to operate closer to him so that the baby-faced assassins could bludgeon even the most trying of oppositions to eternal rest. The 2010 World Cup happened when Iniesta was working at the peak of his powers and him along with Xavi and Alonso in central midfield would take the mickey out of the hapless opponents who always ended up one yard shorter. It was measured carnage that was twofold- running them short of breath and sapping them of the spirit to play football because nobody likes chasing the ball around the park for an hour and a half.
Iniesta played on the pitch like he was playing PlayStation, sitting on a bean bag, sipping on Sangria. Such was his vision. Thierry Henry had once said that Pep used to instruct his players to stay in position and trust their teammates to find them there. Is it just me or is that just about the most entitled, privileged thing you’ve heard a gaffer say? Don’t blame him, blame the likes of Andres for enabling it.
In 2010, in South Africa, Iniesta was constantly playing the right notes and had the world dancing to the tune. He did that while struggling to break out of a ‘dark place’ like he himself described. He had to battle with injury, depression and the death of a dear friend, Dani Jarque. So when he wheeled away in uncontainable joy, he took his shirt off to reveal a vest underneath with the message, ‘Dani Jarque, always with us.’ Iniesta was in the running for the Golden Ball and had orchestrated many an important win for La Furia Roja, even scoring the all-important winning goal against Chile in the group stage. He was also the man of the match in the final. Every footballer’s wet dream. Iniesta did that while just being up to his usual tricks.
With the ball at his feet, Iniesta was a menace the oppositions would have nightmares of and that’s the reason why he would come away from the World Cup final with scars all over. It was indeed warfare and it was only fitting that he proved to be the difference between the sides on the grandest stage of ‘em all.
Wherever Iniesta goes, people stand up and applaud and Andres meekly looks up and thanks them all, modest to a fault. And as he walks away from Barcelona, football fans will feel a tug at the heart because there is no way you could love football and not admire this champion that at times we feel like we don’t deserve.
The wait for the next Andres Iniesta could never bear fruit for all we have seen and known. And that’s quite alright. A highlight reel of Spain’s finest will stretch till we’re bloody sick of beauty. Spain hasn’t been able to replicate their success from 2010 and they crashed out of the 2014 World Cup in the group stages. But Iniesta will go down in history as one of the greatest ever and when he picked up an injury before the World Cup in 2010, Vincent Del Bosque said that he’d wait for as long as it took for Andres to get back because quality like that need not be tried and tested in the training ground.
It is meant to paint itself on the grand canvas and boy o boy, isn’t it beautifully poetic how it actually freaking did?
Thank you, Andres Iniesta. Of course, he is one of our 50 Greatest players in World Cup history. - sk
