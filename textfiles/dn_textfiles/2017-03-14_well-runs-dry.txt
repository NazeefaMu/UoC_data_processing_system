Before the well runs dry

In recent years there has been a growing interest in survival by humans in hostile environments. A number of television series have focused on studying and indeed testing the limits to which a person can prevail in a wild environment. The key to survival is really about securing successfully the basics requirements for life, namely shelter, fire, water and food, in that order of importance.
However it can be argued that water is probably the most important of the four. A person can live for about 10 days without eating, but will die within 3 days if he or she fails to secure a supply of fresh drinking water.
In fact, we need to consider that humans essentially consist of water since it makes up for about 70% of our bodies and about 90% of our brains.
Water therefore holds the key to our life in the planet and if food security, is indeed important, then achieving water security is even more so.
This last point was well understood by ancient and medieval Sinhalese rulers whose entire rule over the island, was based on achieving mastery over water through the construction of irrigation tanks. King Parakramabahu I had even said that no drop of water should flow to the sea without first contributing to the well-being of his subjects.
Mahaweli Development Programme
In more recent times projects like the Mahaweli Development Programme have helped considerably for Sri Lanka to boost her agricultural production from irrigation, and her energy needs through hydroelectric power.
But looking today at the issue internationally would underscore the fact that there is a lot of concern about achieving water security. Many countries around the world fear that they may face a situation where ground water resources would be depleted. There is also a concern that this valuable resource cannot be easily restored, if at all. Hence the prospect of some countries not having a regular source of potable water is a very real one.
The problem does not just affect the countries of the Horn of Africa or the Sahel but also some of the Desert States of the USA.
Furthermore, studies have been conducted on how countries have misused this precious resource. It is in fact estimated that the vast bulk of water consumed, a staggering 70%, goes into agricultural production.
In fact what many people do not realize is that everything they eat and drink needs to be produced by using vast quantities of water. In developed countries where meat consumption is very high, it is estimated that 4,500 litres of water are needed to produce a 250-gramme beef steak.
Currently Sri Lanka is looking at developing high end industries such as pharmaceutical and rubber products which will result in economic expansion as they will boost exports and also reduce imports. But it is also important to take stock of the fact that these industries are precisely the very ones which use vast quantities of water, just as Sri Lanka’s current main exports sector, namely apparel. It takes 6,800 litres of water to produce one pair of blue jeans. To grow the cotton for a simple T-Shirt no less than 1,500 litres of water are required.
The manufacture of a single automobile is estimated to use 117,000 Litres of water. Each tire needed for this car will utilize 1,900 Litres of water in the process of production.
Rationalize use of water
Given the total dependence on this valuable resource, governments all around the world and other institutions are working at ways to rationalize the use of water.
The challenge they often face is that the global economy is market driven, hence it becomes difficult for authorities to shape production, which means that they often have a limited capability to rationalize the use of water.
Crops are grown because there is a demand for them in local and international markets.
Nevertheless Governments can indeed look at ways of saving water by identifying for production specific crops that use comparatively little water.
Recycling of water is also high on the agenda. A lot of research in this field has been done in Israel, an arid country that has achieved the capacity of recycling 80% of its water.
Israel has made significant breakthroughs in this area including in the use of sand as a bio active filter, which waste water passes through.
A new focus is on the need to use water efficiently. There is a realization that flood irrigation which is used all around the world, results in loss of about 15 – 20% of the water, due to wind and radiation. Lack of planning has caused a loss of a valuable resource.
Desalination plants have often been shown as the solution to the problem of water shortage. However they are yet another Sword of Damocles hanging over our heads given that they are hardly a cost effective and environmental solution costing hundreds of millions of dollars to build and also burning vast quantities of fossil fuel.
One solution put forward to address some of the issues is the so called “toilet to tap” technology. This is essentially to take the waste water and treat it so that it becomes pure H2O.
This is what Singapore and many parts of California have already achieved, having successfully recycled “black water” for the purpose of drinking.
It is interesting to look at new solutions proposed to deal with water conservation. One solution that has been put forward is to have two separate pipes to bring in water into the home and two to send the water out.
Future energy needs
The water in one pipe will be used for the toilets and the other for everything else such as cooking, drinking and washing. The water sent out will consist of black water (toilets) and grey water (the rest). The water sent out will be used for specific purposes.
The grey water can be used for non-portable purposes such as cooling power plants. The vast quantity of the waste water could meet the needs of massive power plants required to address future energy needs.
Black water is already used and the carbon food waste is often made into bio diesel.
There have also been research into the field of nutrient recovery from waste water. The nutrients from black water have already been used in some countries to grow crops. Hence there are new opportunities that can be tapped and the recycling of this waste has generated considerable interest in the area of urban farming, where crops could be grown within cities, in buildings where natural conditions would be simulated.
Hence there should be much more awareness on the part of all stakeholders of the fact that water resources need to be carefully preserved and that solutions to utilize this previous resource in a planned and efficient way will determine our long term success in our quest to develop economically or simply to survive.
