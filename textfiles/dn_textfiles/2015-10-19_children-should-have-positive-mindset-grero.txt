Children should have a positive mindset - Grero

We should not be concentrating on changing governments, but, instead to change the mindset of our children, since they are the future of our nation, said University Education and Highways State Minister Mohan Lal Grero.
He was delivering a lecture at Waga Vanarathana Maha Vidyalaya.
He further said the education system of our country specially laid emphasis on a competitive examination system which focuses on mathematical intelligence, language intelligence and rhythmic-intelligence. For instance, the Grade 5 scholarship exam, G.C.E O/Ls & A/Ls cannot measure the inter-personal intelligence, Emotional intelligence etc.
“We must identify our child and his talents which are given them by birth. We can’t expect wormwood tree from a banyan plant. Even you can’t expect a sandalwood tree from a banyan plant,” State Minister Grero said.
“There are some children who have the inter-personal intelligence where they can gather information within a few seconds. Their communication skills, inter-personal skills are unbelievable. They are the people who leads to countries. Therefore, we must identify their skills at the very first period and help them to improve themselves, because we need to make educated leaders. As parents and teachers, we have the responsibility to infuse confidence in our students,”he said.
“We require people with special skills in many areas to compete with the ever changing world. If you can identify the capacities and capabilities of your children at the inception, then you can direct them to the right path. The foremost duty and responsibility of the older generation is to guide youngsters to identify their inborn talents,” he said.
