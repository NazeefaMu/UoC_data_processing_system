Govt. to ensure quality elder care

The government is taking action to ensure quality elder care throughout the country, a joint press release issued by the Prime Minister’s Office and the National Secretariat for Elders said yesterday.
The release adds: “The demand for elder care services is inadequately fulfilled or fulfilled in an unstructured manner.
“The National Secretariat for Elders and the Committee appointed by the Prime Minister has developed a curriculum for training Elder Care Assistants.
This pilot project aims to: train and provide quality Elder Care Assistants to reach the specified standards; ensure elder care needs are met; promote professional, safe, and caring elder care givers; ensure quality assured standardised processes nationwide.
“The development of the curriculum has included consultation with the National Secretariat for Elders, Helpage, Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo, tertiary and Vocational Education Commission (TVEC), National Apprentice and Industrial Training Authority (NAITA) and the Vocational Training Authority (VTA).
“The initial programme will consist of 112 hours of classroom, role play and practical internships. The programme will be conducted in a structured and progressive manner to enable the Elder Care Assistants to acquire skills that will be in demand in Sri Lanka and overseas.
Training is supported by a training manual with a scientific approach to care giving, including physical, psychological, social and spiritual aspects. The cycle of care giving will include pre-assessment, problem identification and prioritisation, setting objectives or targets, implementation of activities and outcome evaluation, including blended learning techniques through the use of digital technology.
