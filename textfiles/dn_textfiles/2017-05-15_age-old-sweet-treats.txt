Age old sweet treats

Do you wish you’d kept a few of your favourite, long-gone chocolate bars in the house for a rainy day?
We can no longer tuck into Cadbury Dreams, Aztecs or orange Drifters, should a craving hit us while we’re watching Coronation Street.
Well, most of us can’t. But one man in Wales has been stashing limited edition choccie bars for decades - including some with special Westlife and Spice Girls wrappers (yes, that’s how old they are).
Lester Hughes, from Pwllheli, has bags and boxes full of the stuff and has even been offered £40 for his special Star Wars-themed bars.
Some even went out of date in the early 1990s and he stopped collecting more than 15 years ago when he had a ‘freezer disaster’ - but he still has a cellar full of them.
The 47-year-old father-of-two told the Daily Post : “I can’t remember exactly why I started collecting. I think I saw ‘limited edition’ on a bar once and thought, ‘why not buy it and save it’.“It then became a bit of an obsession and I actively went looking for limited edition chocolate bars to buy. “I decided to put them in my freezer but then it got to the point where I had more chocolate in my freezer than actual food.
“It was like this for a few years until my freezer broke, so I put them in to bags and boxes and took them down to the cellar.
“I’ve not checked them all but some of them go back 20 to 25 years.
“I have no plans to start collecting again, I’m not sure I have the space in the freezer to keep them anymore, or the willpower not to eat them now either!” Lester doesn’t want to sell the bars, even though he was offered £40 for the limited edition Star Wars chocolate, as he wants to keep the collection together. The dad added: “Since putting the pictures of the bars up on Facebook I’ve had a really good response.
“I think a lot of people remember some of the chocolate bars when they were children themselves.
“It’s good for people to see some of the bars they no longer make anymore.
“What is amazing is that I can’t even find some of the bars of chocolate in my collection on google, so I’m wondering if even the chocolate companies themselves have kept a bar for reference.”Sky News
