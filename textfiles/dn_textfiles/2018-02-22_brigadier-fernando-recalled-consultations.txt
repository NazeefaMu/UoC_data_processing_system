Brigadier Fernando recalled for consultations

Minister Counsellor (Defence) attached to the Sri Lankan High Commission in London Brigadier Priyankara Fernando had been recalled to Sri Lanka for consultations, said Military Spokesperson Brigadier Sumith Atapattu, yesterday.
Brigadier Attapattu addressing the weekly media briefing said no inquiry was being held against the Defence Attaché. “We just wish to talk to him about what happened”.
He explained that while there was diplomatic pressure and the impact the incident had on the image of the country needed to be discussed, as far as the military was concerned, this was not a ‘serious crime’.
“There have been people who supported him as well as criticized him for that and we just wish to find out what really happened given the circumstances,” said Brigadier Atapattu. In early February, Brigadier Fernando was filmed while making a gesture which symbolized the ‘cutting of a throat’, in response to a group of Tamil protesters outside the High Commission.
Although the Foreign Ministry at the time immediately recalled him from service, the President later reinstated him.
