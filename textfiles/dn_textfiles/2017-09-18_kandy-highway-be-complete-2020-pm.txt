Kandy highway to be complete by 2020 - PM

It has been planned to complete the construction of the central highway to Kandy by 2020, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister added that construction project of the Kandy highway, which consists of four phases, is in progress now, will be commissioned by 2020.
The Prime Minister made these remarks while presiding over the opening ceremony of the newly established Police Station in Mawathagama on Saturday.
The Premier addressing the gathering said the first phase of the construction from Kadawatha to Kossinna is being carried out by a Chinese company while the second phase from Kossinna to Pothuhera is being carried out by local constructors.
The third phase from Pothuhera to Galagedara has been undertaken by a Japanese construction company while the fourth phase has been undertaken by an Indian construction company, the Prime Minister said.
He said construction of the central highway began during the Rajapaksa regime without any proper plan as it was a political event.
The former Government didn’t allocate funds for the project but only for the opening ceremony. As a result of that, the project had been stagnating for years.
However, under this Government, the project will be completed, he said.
The local constructors, who engage in the construction of the second phase, will be able to enter the international construction arena once they complete the project, the Prime Minister said.
