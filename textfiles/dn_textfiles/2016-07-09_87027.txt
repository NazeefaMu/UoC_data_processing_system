Special committee to mitigate VAT related issues: Colonne

A special committee has been appointed on the advice of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to mitigate VAT related issues and make the people aware regarding the VAT, UNP Parliamentarian Nalaka Colonne said.
He made these comments addressing a press conference at Sirikotha yesterday.
Colonne said public awareness seminars on VAT will be held countrywide.
The business community will be made aware on how the VAT is calculated and the process of VAT collection, the MP said.
He said five officers each will be appointed to every divisional secretariat to assist the business community to calculate VAT and to assist to complete other documentary activities.
These five officers will be permanently deployed to assist people, Colonne added.
He said only businessmen who exceed the monthly transaction of Rs. 1 million should register for the VAT.
"Therefore, small scale businessmen are exempted from the payment of VAT. However, it has been seen that these small scale businessmen are misinformed by certain persons to gain political gains," Colonne said.
