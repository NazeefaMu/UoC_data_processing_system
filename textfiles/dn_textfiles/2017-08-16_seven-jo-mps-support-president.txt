Seven JO MPs to support President

Seven MPs presently aligned with the Joint Opposition will support President Maithripala Sirisena to further strengthen the SLFP, Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Youth Front Chairman Shantha Bandara said yesterday.
These seven parliamentarians have already expressed their consent to lend their helping hand to the President to strengthen the party to face the forthcoming elections, Bandara said addressing the media at the SLFP headquarters.
“These seven parliamentarians will join the President soon and discussions are still on” he said.
Asked who these seven members are, Bandara refrained from revealing names but said their decision is confirmed.
“The Joint Opposition is shattering now.There are internal disputes within it and it is deteriorating” he said.
Bandara said an independent survey carried out by the Youth Front has revealed that the political power of President Sirisena is increasing gradually day by day.
“It has been revealed by the survey that members, who support the President is increasing significantly” he said.
He said that candidates are being selected for the forthcoming elections including the Provincial Council Election.
“It is not ethical to level allegations on the President because he is not responsible for the delay in holding the Local Government election.The delay is because the Local Government Elections Act was amended.The amended Act will be presented to Parliament on August 24. No sooner it is passed in Parliament, the LG election will be held,”Bandara said.
With the 2012 LG poll, at which Bharatha Laksman Premachandra was killed, people called for a new electoral system without the preferential votes.Therefore, the LG Election Act was amended accordingly, Bandara said.
