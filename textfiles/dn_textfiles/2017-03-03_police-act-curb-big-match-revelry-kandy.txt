Police act to curb Big Match revelry in Kandy

Over here in the hills the month of March is indeed a month of celebration as traditions come alive and the Kandy Police headed by some sports loving persons have warned all big match playing school authorities that big match revelry should be confined to the venue of the game. Most of the cricket lovers and the public in Kandy are happy over the decision taken by the sporting Kandy Police authorities.
The Big Match fever in Kandy starts off today with the 59th ‘Battle of the Babes’ between Vidyartha College and St. Sylvester’s College at the Pallekele Stadium. Old Sylvestrian cricketer Janaka Pathirana has been invited by the host St. Sylvester’s to be the chief guest for the occasion.
Both teams will be introduced to him and at the end of the game he will hand over the Rev Fr Don George trophy to the winners.
