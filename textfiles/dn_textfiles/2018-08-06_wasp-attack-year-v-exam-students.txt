Wasp attack on Year V Exam students

Nearly 130 people and 84 students sitting for the Year V Scholarship Examination yesterday were hospitalised the previous day (August 4) following a wasp attack during an Asheervada Buddhapooja held at the Sri Sudarshanarama Viharaya in Padaviya to invoke blessings on the students. Padaviya police said wasps attacked them when their nest fell on the ground. Hospital sources said doctors and nurses quickly treated the students with antibiotics and sent them home before August 5 morning to enable them to sit for the exam.
