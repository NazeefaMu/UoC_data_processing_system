The salesman and sales efficiency

Marketing is talking about push and pull strategies with all the activities revolving around seven Ps and namely product, price, place, promotion, people, process, and physical evidence.
The promotion mix is also referred to as the marketing communication mix where the data and information is exchanged to the client for his purchasing choices.
For most part, when an organisation makes a marketing communications business plan, it consolidates various types of correspondence channels in the general mix.
This is done to guarantee that the message of the organisation reaches the end customer. It is likewise done to guarantee reiteration so that the client reviews the brand due to the brand message being repeated in different channels immediately.
Communication mix includes advertising, sales promotions, public relations, personal selling, and direct marketing/Internet marketing.
Personal selling and its strategic perspective
Kotler and Armstrong define personal selling as personal presentation by the organisation’s sales team for the purpose of making sales and building customer relationships.
Broadly the sales function contributes to the organisation in the way of letting the target customers know what’s on offer, helping in building relationships with new and current customers, and building credibility with customers. Personal selling is the only element in communication mix where customer and buyer interact.
It is the most direct, immediate and personalised approach and that is the main reason why an organisation needs to be more focused on the salesman’s capability, skills and attitudes which will blend in the process of communicating with the customer.
Salesmen get involved in the communication process with the customer from the prospecting stage, through the transaction stage, to post transaction, where the involvement of all other communication mix elements will be limited to one or few stages of the process, in terms of ability to convince, convey, understand the exact needs, and satisfy them.
Personal selling is the most effective tool compares to other communication mix elements.
This is one main reason why an organisation needs to have a brilliant salesforce instead of just numbers.
From the salesman’s point of view the salesman need to ‘cut through the clutter’ in terms of performance, capabilities and mostly the willingness to perform.
Communication process
The customer goes through an evaluation process within his mind before the purchase decision. Competitors usually track the customer’s thinking process to gain the advantage, but the salesperson can himself understand the customer’s thinking process and use it to his own organisation's strength effectively.
The salesperson should have good knowledge about his own organisation and its products so that they can customise their requirements proactively thus winning customer loyalty in the long run. The selling process is vital for all salespeople to understand, which includes grasping customer needs, decision making stimulus, fulfilling that need and satisfying the customer without allowing any post-purchase dissonance.
Objectives of personal selling
An organisation may have the best brands and the best products spend the majority of the promotions budget on advertising, but if the salesman is not managed well the efforts will be a waste.
Salesman to stimulate the pull - mainly to encourage the intermediaries (in the case of B2C channel sales) to purchase, stock and display in a way to facilitate the end customer to pull. The salesperson is the key to penetrating, making the product range freely available for the consumer to pull.
Salesman as a communication medium – the salesperson acts as a communication medium to the end customer and the intermediaries.
For the retailer to be an information hub the salesperson needs to be smart and strong in providing all necessary information. Salespersons ability and skills make sure the intermediary will remember information and in turn pass on to the customer at the purchase decision.
Key essentials of a salesperson
The most important element of the organisation to succeed is the resources, mainly human resources and the strategies planned and executed by the people.
The salesman is also a part of the resources who is involved in delivering the strategic perspective of the organisation.
But the efficiency and the effectiveness of the salesman will not produce the desired results because it depends on how the target customers are approached and convinced to buy.
Personal selling - benefits to the organisation
Personal selling allows your organisation to come out from the traditional thinking that the customer will purchase what we have.
The ability and skills of the salesperson will create a customised approach and in the long run customers will be loyal to their brands.
In Sri Lanka, the salesman shifts jobs frequently with his client database. But the success of the salesman is always dependent on his capabilities and the attractiveness of the organisation's offerings.
Most of the time the customer remains with the organisation and its products depending on the benefits derived from the product or service and the relationship with the salesperson.
One of the key strategies and broad objective of personal selling is relationship strategy. There is no other better mechanism of creating relationships with customers other than through personal selling.
The management of the organisation should be smart enough to obtain the best commercial value and benefit to the organisation through its sales personnel.
The relationship between the customer and the selling organisation always helps to build and develop collaborative relationships for short-term and long-term goals.
Traditional to modern approaches in sales
Traditional versus modern selling is always an interesting topic to discuss during sales meetings. Everyone has their unique approach but it has to match to evolve with your customer's needs or else you will get left behind.
I think most salespeople will agree that in the past 12 years or so, to be successful you need to have at least a small amount of modern consultative selling within your overall style and personality.
The role of the modern salesperson is very different from what we commonly termed as traditional selling jobs.
These days the seller is aware that the buyer is now more aware of the seemingly clever complexity and refinement of today’s selling. To those in charge of setting the standards, creating the presentation styles and being able to influence the direction modern selling is taking has been primarily influenced by the increased number of motivators who consistently work at reinforcing what can be done.
Today the standard of selling is up, whereas the ground level is fuelled by many of today’s small business owners who encourage those that seem to be personality-driven to get into sales. Since they won’t encourage formal training, that sector of sales is still churning people who last just a year or two and in the process contribute the questionable reputation some sectors of the sales industry unfortunately carry.
In short, here are two simplistic ways of capturing the differences between the two.
1. The more traditional approach taught by many in the 70s, 80s and 90s was very salesman and saleswoman oriented (primarily salesman) and worked on the premise that the selling process attempted to create a small number of needs in customers during the presentation process. The goal then was to make sales and the approach was generally inflexible.
2. The more modern view is that selling primarily should be customer-oriented and the salesperson should try to discover customers' wants (and to a lesser extent needs) by discussing their situation with them through a somewhat static questioning process. The goal of modern selling is to build long-term relationships and to create customers who will be encouraged to provide repeat business, rather than just generating one-off sales.
This approach seems to be working better and is much more flexible allowing the salesperson to adapt to the unique needs and situation of the customer.
Sales push and customer pull
Every individual has to play the role of the customer at one given point of time. If you do a self-evaluation of your own buying decision process, you will understand how complicated it is.
It may be an insurance policy, motor vehicle investment plan or any kind of high-value complex product or your daily rations such as brands of rice, food items and toothpaste. Your decision process involves gathering information, communicating and experiencing for consideration of buying.
Customer pull is the demand created by the customer and the push is purely the function of the salesperson. Personal selling may include the product displays, merchandising and influencing the retailer or the intermediary to promote one's brand or the product.
The customer is always in the driving seat; organisations can provide lots of information via many channels to create attraction towards the brands and products.
Marketing as a concept shows how to understand and anticipate customer needs and theoretically enable customers to pull when they have a need.
There are a lot of important reasons that enable us to engage customers in different and more impactful ways. However, we need to understand that the salesman has a better and bigger obligation to push the sales because it is not possible for the sales to be pulled and management needs to understand that sales cannot be pulled forcibly.
Factors for effective selling
Selling skills, knowledge and attitudes make the salesperson to be effective or not. Most of the time salesman may be lacking one or many of the factors and the responsibility of the supervisors are to manage and control them in the salesperson.
Sales pitch, understanding the needs of the customers, analyses the type of prospects and the conversion of the prospects into customers will be based on the skills of the salesman.
Self-motivation to be successful is a precondition for this effectiveness. Douglas McGregor (1960) said there are two types of people named X type and Y type.
X type people dislike their work, have no ambition to perform, avoid responsibility, have to be controlled, need to be supervised and have no interest to work.
Y type of people are creative and plan ahead, are more organized, are eager to work, take more responsibility, make positive decisions and are comfortable in the working environment.
It is essential to make sure that your sales team has more weight on Y type of salespeople. If not the result will be not much different as less motivated salespeople cannot participate in business and may damage the spirit of the team efforts too.
Knowing the competition is an analytical skill, the salesperson should be convinced of the benefits that your company can offer over the competition.
Industrial selling
Also known as B2B selling, the difference from retail is that two or more organisations get involved in buying and selling, rather an individual salesman and a customer. Complexity is high by nature simply because of the number of individuals involved in the decision making process. The salesman has the responsibility of convincing many individuals representing the buying organisation and the needs and benefits of each individual are different.
In these situations, the salesman needs to be smart in understanding each decision maker in the buying organisation so that each stakeholder is satisfied. (Morris, 1992) described the three types of buying in organisations: speculative buying, forward buying, and hand-to-mouth buying.
In the first two methods focus on purchases for futuristic requirements are projected and forecasted, but hand-to-mouth buying is about the organisation buying as much when needed and in smaller quantities.
Service selling
In service selling, the service and selling function takes place simultaneously. Seller needs to be service oriented and treat the customer with a service-oriented mindset since both functions of selling and service is experienced by the customer at the same time.
Service selling requires an effective association to build a fruitful market yield with clients. The challenge in service selling is you can create a push via excellent service orientation but there are limitations on creating a pull function. Word of mouth is the best channel and medium for service selling to spread among the target audience and pull customers looking for such experiences in high service levels.
Retail selling
Selling could be done via physical stores or on a door-to-door basis. A retail sale happens when a business pitches an item or service to an individual buyer for his or her own utilisation.
The exchange itself can happen through various diverse sales channels, for example, on the web, in a physical storefront, through direct deals, or regular postal mail.
The part of the sale that qualifies it as a retail exchange is that the end client is a buyer. Sales channel management is a key function in the retail selling function. Retail networks add value to the organisation products by the way of sorting, displaying merchandise, transportation and demonstration to push the product to the final consumer.
Sales ethics
These days, most ethicists trust that relationship selling is sensible work on prompting positive connections among buyers and sellers. Relationship selling requires that guidelines are not really legally binding. It enables purchasers and dealers to cooperate.
In any case, there are detriments to this approach as relationship offering needs time to create and it might be hard to build up an expected code of conduct. Marketers must know about moral measures and adequate conduct.
