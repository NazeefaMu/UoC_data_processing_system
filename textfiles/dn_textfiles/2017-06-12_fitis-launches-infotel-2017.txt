FITIS launches INFOTEL 2017

On theme ‘Towards a Digital Economy’
The Federation of Information Technology Industry Sri Lanka () has arranged to conduct their National ICT Exhibition - INFOTEL - this year under the theme ‘Towards a Digital Economy’, supported by the Ministry of Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure and the ICT Agency of Sri Lanka.
As the biggest and most prestigious ICT exhibition in Sri Lanka and the whole of South Asia, INFOTEL 2017 will be held from November 2-4 at the BMICH in Colombo.
Inaugurated in 1992, FITIS and INFOTEL are celebrating their 25th anniversary this year. Benchmarking this historic occasion, FITIS will organise ‘INFOTEL 2017’ in a different way, going beyond the mode of a traditional exhibition.
Pledging government support for this national endeavour, Harin Fernando, Minister of Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure, chairs the Steering Committee of INFOTEL 2017. The official briefing to the stakeholders of this new move was held recently at the Hilton Colombo Residence.
Minister Fernando who was chief guest said the theme of INFOTEL 2017 exhibition ‘Towards a Digital Economy’ is topical and absolutely relevant in an era where the entire world is swiftly going digital. The objective of the government is to provide digital facilities to every citizen of the country.
“The government is making an indefatigable effort to develop digital infrastructure to make this vital facility easily accessible to the people across the country. I believe that achieving the goal of total digitalisation will translate into productive and viable development which will reflect positively on the lives of the masses. Hence, I kindly request all stakeholders to support this national endeavour in a possible way,” he said. INFOTEL has been focused on the country’s national growth all throughout its history and it has been the platform to experience the latest trends and cutting edge technologies for Sri Lanka.
A significant turnout of around 100,000 visitors, including executive officers of local and foreign companies in the ICT sphere, eminent professionals, policy makers, entrepreneurs, educationists, school students, educational institutions and universities, teachers, lecturers and members of the public, are expected to visit this premier exhibition this year.
“After taking over the mantle as FITIS Chairman this historic year where we are celebrating our 25th year, we mapped out a comprehensive action plan to bring the ICT industry to a greater level. We identified the INFOTEL National ICT Exhibition as the best platform in this scenario. Benchmarking this historic occasion, we invited all stakeholders in the industry to support us in this national endeavour as the onerous task of developing Sri Lanka’s ICT industry cannot be shouldered by the private sector alone. The support, assistance and guidance of the existing government and relevant state-run institutions are of utmost importance. In this backdrop, we made every endeavour to work with the government and state-owned institutions and it is a big achievement to bring these sectors into a common forum like this. The ideal opportunity has now arisen to overcome the challenges we face and emerge victorious. This is a historic occasion for Sri Lanka’s ICT industry,” said Dr Kithsiri Manchanayakke, Chairman of FITIS.
“Over the years, INFOTEL has earned a reputation as the pinnacle ICT event in the calendar of all those actively involved in the field. They consider it a ‘must’ to visit this eagerly-awaited, innovative exhibition which, in itself, offers a refreshing experience,” said Upul Dassanayake, Co-Chairman of INFOTEL 2017 and the President of the FITIS Education and Training Chapter. Extending an invitation to all Sri Lankans to visit the INFOTEL2017, Dassanayake assured those present that it will be a productive learning experience which will enrich their lives.
 
Amila Bandara, Co-Chairman of INFOTEL 2017 and Assistant Secretary of FITIS Education and Training Chapter said, “INFOTEL National ICT Exhibition is one of the oldest and biggest ICT-related exhibitions in South Asia. It is due to the untiring efforts and profound commitment of the organising committee that it has been possible to host this prestigious exhibition annually and take it to new heights since its inception.”
