Death,  fear thou not!

The political antics of Wimal Weerawansa, who staged a so-called ‘fast unto death’ in prison continued to grab political headlines last week but, in the end, left the leader of the Jathika Nidahas Peramuna (JNP) worse off as he was refused bail and re-remanded on Monday.
Weerawansa is languishing in remand prison facing charges of misappropriating over 40 state vehicles while he was Minister of Housing in the government headed by President Mahinda Rajapaksa. He is alleged to have distributed these vehicles among family, friends and party workers, thus abusing his position as a minister.
Whatever his faults as a politician, Weerawansa has a knack for news. It was only recently that he grabbed headlines declaring that he was withdrawing from the United Peoples’ Freedom Alliance (UPFA). As such, he argued before Speaker Karu Jayasuriya in Parliament, he was entitled to the privileges of a party leader.
This was not unfamiliar territory for Speaker Jayasuriya, who is doing an excellent job of work as the arbiter of such disputes. Several months ago, the Joint Opposition (JO) faction of the UPFA made the same demand. They said they were a distinct group within the UPFA parliamentary group and had a right to be recognised as such.
Extra parliamentary privileges
The JO group went even further and demanded that they be allowed to choose the Leader of the Opposition as their grouping- numbering 51- was greater than the Tamil National Alliance (TNA). In adjudicating this request, Speaker Jayasuriya confirmed what many analysts had acknowledged already: those elected under the UPFA could have only one leader of its parliamentary group.
Citing the same reason, Speaker Jayasuriya declined Weerawansa’s request to be recognised as a party leader. Thus his hopes of having extra parliamentary privileges were dashed. It was abundantly clear that, apart from enjoying these privileges, Weerawansa had no intention of parting ways with the JO faction of the UPFA- in fact, he was working very much in concert with them.
Hot on the heels of this episode came the ‘fast unto death’ drama at Welikada. Weerawansa was protesting the decision not to grant him bail and claiming that his detention was causing distress to his sixteen year old daughter, Vimasha Weerawansa who had been referred to the Lady Ridgeway Children’s’ Hospital in Colombo for treatment. Citing this, Weerawansa was seeking bail under exceptional circumstances.
Misappropriation of state property
This question brought to the fore an interesting issue. While the government’s critics argue that Weerawansa is the victim of a political witch-hunt, he still has to satisfactorily counter the charges of misappropriation of state property which is a serious offence. Besides, the bail issue was at the discretion of judges who were hearing his case- and no one, not even the JO, was claiming that judges were being influenced not to grant Weerawansa bail.
Indeed, had Weerawansa been granted bail due to his protest, it would have caused even more difficulties. It had the potential to open the floodgates- each and every prisoner at Welikada could then stage a fast unto death and demand to be released on bail- surely, they could all find some exceptional circumstances to justify their actions!
It will be recalled that in recent years, two high profile parliamentarians had been jailed. Former Minister S. B. Dissanayake was jailed for contempt of the Supreme Court when it was headed by then Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva.
Weerawansa himself was very much a part and parcel of the government that jailed former Army Commander Sarath Fonseka who later went on to become a Member of Parliament. Both being outspoken men in their own individual way, they suffered their plight stoically without resorting to the antics that Weerawansa is now engaged in.
Nevertheless, there were many significant behind the scenes moves from the JO to convince Weerawansa to call off his fast. Many were wondering why his mentor, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa did not visit him and request him to call off the fast- as he did when Weerawansa was protesting against then United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki Moon’s decision to appoint a panel of experts to inquire into allegations of war crimes in Sri Lanka in July 2010.
Independence of judiciary
Less than three days into that fast, Rajapaksa visited Weerawansa with a glass of water opposite the United Nations’ office in Colombo where that drama was unfolding- and Weerawansa promptly called off his fast, saying he could not decline a request from his leader.
Rajapaksa, a veteran of many a political battle would know the hardships of being in remand prison. He too was in remand prison when his mother passed away. At the time, he was provided with special dispensation to attend his mother’s funeral.
In this instance, Rajapaksa may not have intervened because that would have led to questions about his commitment to the independence of the judiciary. Nevertheless, he did speak to President Maithripala Sirisena over the issue.
A JO delegation which included Dinesh Gunawardena, Vasudeva Nanayakkara and Mahindananda Aluthgamage also met with the President to raise the same issue. President Sirisena gave them a patient hearing and, after clarifying matters with the Attorney General’s Department advised the JO that they should use legal means to try and secure bail for Weerawansa.
The JO delegation, sans Vasudeva Nanayakkara, also met with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and raised the same issue. They also met with Speaker Karu Jayasuriya. While both were sympathetic, it was clear that any application for bail had to be made through the normal procedures and that the government would not interfere with the judicial process.
Meanwhile, Weerawansa’s physical health was declining, as he was fasting. He was moved from prison to Prison Hospital, mostly as a precautionary measure.
That was when the influential Buddhist monk and the head of the nurses’ trade union, Muruthettuwe Ananda thera suggested that should the Mahanayake theras appeal to Weerawansa, he may call off the fast. Acting on this advice, the JO obtained letters from the Mahanayake thera of the Ramanna Nikaya and Anunayake thera of the Malwatte Chapter.
Making a martyr of Weerawansa
They then visited Weerawansa, accompanied by a delegation of Buddhist monks who chanted pirith and offered him a glass of milk. Weerawansa then called off the fast. This was an anti-climax after the propaganda that went into making a martyr of Weerawansa- and an eerie replay of what happened in 2010, the only difference being that he was offered a glass of milk by a Buddhist monk instead of being offered a glass of water by Mahinda Rajapaksa.
The post-script to the event came on Monday, when Weerawansa’s lawyers submitted a fresh application for bail. This was however rejected by Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne.
The bail application was made on the grounds of exceptional circumstances noting that Weerawansa’s daughter had been admitted to hospital due to a mental health condition after her father was remanded.
The Magistrate was to note that there wasn’t sufficient information in the reports submitted to courts which could explain the health condition of Weerawansa’s daughter. A further hearing has been fixed for tomorrow (Friday) where the saga is likely to continue.
Regardless of the outcome on Friday, there appears to be a general perception among the public that the ongoing battle of wits is one staged by Weerawansa to gain more political mileage. The publicity surrounding his ‘death fast’ appeared to be obviously well orchestrated as was the campaign for his release.
If Weerawansa indeed continued the fast, the public perception may have changed but his decision to meekly end the fast gives credence to the belief that this is yet another publicity stunt by the JNP leader, similar to the one he engaged in, in 2010.
In 2010 though, he could walk away from the fast, a hero in the eyes of some and a hypocrite in the eyes of others. Seven years later even if Wimal Weerawansa is eventually granted bail, he will have to deal with a greater issue: the outstanding matter of misappropriating state property.
