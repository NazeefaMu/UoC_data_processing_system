Why MR against job creation in H'tota?

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Thursday, queried as to why former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is against the provision of employment to the youth in the Hambantota district.
Addressing the gathering at the opening of the Samasaranagama housing complex of 70 houses to mark the 70 th anniversary of UNP and to mark the 50th birth day of Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said the youth in Hambantota will be self-reliant after the Hambantota Industrial Zone is set up and new industries come up.
He said the regaining of GSP plus has proved to be a tower of strength for the export sector of Sri Lanka.
He said: "We can export goods worth US $ 500 million to Europe as a result of regaining GSP plus that was lost as a result of short sighted policies of the previous regime."
"A period of transition will dawn on Hambantota with the setting up of the industrial zone. Hambantota needs about 2,000 industrial ventures. We will utilise 95 percent of state land. We as a country are indebted as a result of the setting up of the Hambantota seaport and other projects launched in a haphazard manner by the previous regime. The government has to pay US $ 1,900 million to settle the loans. We don't have enough funds for this. If we don’t follow this, we will have to burden the people with taxes," he said.
"There were protest campaigns when we launched the industrial zone project last week. There is a possibility of establishing industrial ventures in other part of the country if Hambantota does not want them. There are requests from the ministers of other districts for the setting up of industrial ventures. But the maximum number of needy people are in Hambantota. It is our duty to set up industrial ventures in Hambantota and provide job opportunities to the youth.
Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa said that there are 2,500,000 families in Sri Lanka and out of them, 190,000 don’t have houses. About 79 percent of families in Hambantota remain without houses. About 264 Udagammana are being set up, the minister said.
