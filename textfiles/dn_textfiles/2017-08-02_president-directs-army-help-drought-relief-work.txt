President directs Army to help in drought relief work

President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday ordered relevant authorities to appoint Army officers on a Divisional Secretariat basis to carry out relief measures in the drought affected areas. The President made this order during a progress review meeting held to assess the current status in disaster affected regions. The President told authorities that it was the responsibility of all stakeholders to attend to the needs of the disaster stricken people without delay.
While noting that funds needed to carry out relief measures have already been provided to all relevant departments, the President added that it was the responsibility of heads of these departments to ensure that these are utilised in a highly productive manner.
The President also said that his decision to provide a dry rations pack to the affected had been conveyed to the cabinet of ministers yesterday.
On providing alternative lands to recent floods and landslide affected, the President ordered that identifying suitable lands should be completed before August 15 and if there are issues written submissions should be made before Wednesday.
He said beneficiaries should be provided alternate lands before the end of the month.
Minister Anura Yapa, Vajira Abeywardene, Faizer Mustapha, Mangala Samaraweera and President’s Secretary Austin Fernando also participated.
