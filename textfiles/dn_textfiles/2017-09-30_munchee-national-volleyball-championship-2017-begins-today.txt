The National Volleyball Championship will be conducted under Novice and Super League, forming altogether four categories for men and women as in the previous years. The tournament will be held at the district level and later National level. For the first time in Sri Lanka the SLVF is holding a number of exclusive matches in outdoor venues in several areas including Colombo, Gampaha, Hambantota, Galle and Trincomalee. The premier matches are played indoors, and are witnessed by a limited audience. However, During last year’s convention it was suggested to conduct the matches outdoors so that a greater number of fans can witness these premium quality matches.
This year 2,500 to 3,000 teams will take part in this championship including country’s top eight men’s and six women’s teams. Air Force, Army, Navy, National Youth Services Council, Ports Authority, Police, Ceylon Electricity Board and Mercantile Services Combined teams will be competing in the men’s category of the Super League while Army, Navy, Air Force, National Youth Services Council, Police and Mercantile Services Combined teams will be competing in the women’s category.
The winners will receive Rs. 150,000, Rs. 100,000 and Rs. 50,000 with a trophy each in a Super League men’s and women’s categories. The Novice champions will be awarded Rs. 100,000, Rs. 50,000 and Rs. 25,000 with a trophy each for men’s and women’s teams. As the proud sponsor of the country’s national sport, Munchee has not only helped to develop and popularize the sport but has also created new avenues and a national platform to support and groom young talented players throughout the island.
