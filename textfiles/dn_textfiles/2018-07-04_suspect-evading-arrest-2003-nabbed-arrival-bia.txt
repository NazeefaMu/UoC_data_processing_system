The CID arrested a wanted suspect who was evading arrest and hiding in a foreign country, when he had arrived in Sri Lanka using a forged passport. He was arrested early Monday morning.
The suspect was wanted for attempting to run over a police officer in the Jaya Mawatha junction area in Balaluwewa, Galkiriyagama, in 2003 and snatching a T56 rifle from the two police officers on duty there.
The 45-year-old suspect, Dileepa Kumaratunge alias Samantha, is a resident of Puwakpitiya, Galewela. His used his forged passport which was under the name Madipola Gedara Waruna Deshapriya, to attempt to enter the country from Kuwait.
The suspect has an open warrant issued against him by the Anuradhapura High Court and investigations revealed that he was a former Air Force airman and had deserted the SLAF in 2001, after three years of service.
In addition to the above charge, the suspect is facing other charges of forgery, possession of a forged passport and driving licence and impersonation, and was scheduled to be produced before the No. 02 Colombo Magistrate’s Court yesterday (3).
The CID is conducting further investigations.
Police Media Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said criminals should be warned that no matter how long they remain in hiding and try to escape the law, it is a mere matter of time before they will be apprehended and brought to justice.
