JVP urges government to abolish Executive Presidency

The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna yesterday urged the government to do away with the Executive Presidency as they promised prior to the 2015 election.
JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake addressing the media in Colombo recenly recalled that abolishing the executive presidency was the main election pledge given by the government before 2015 polls.
He said the government has only amended the powers of the Executive Presidency through the 19th Amendment.
He said the President and the government should stand by the pledge and abolish the Executive Presidency, which has led to a number of issues in the country.
Dissanayake warned that in the event the government failed to do so, the JVP would launch a struggle with the people to realise the goal.
The JVP leader said his party has had talks with the SLMC, the TNA and the Communist Party about a new constitution. He said he hoped to meet the President as well shortly to discuss the matter.
