Welfare projects enrich Matara low-income families

Matara district low-income families are to receive drinking water and more sanitary facilities than what they already have.
The Divisional Secretariat Divisions of Dickwella, Devinuwara, Matara, Weligama, Mulatiyana, Pasgoda, and Pitabeddara have initiated community welfare projects in this regard.
Over 30 families were provided with water through tank fabrications and 20 others who lack proper sanitary facilities were granted funds to construct water-sealed lavatories under the project.
The Project Director and the Director of the Matara Institute for Developments of Community Strengths said 130 low income families would get water tanks and finance to put up water sealed lavatories this year.
The German Association for International Development sponsors the programme, Director C. Ranawaka said.
