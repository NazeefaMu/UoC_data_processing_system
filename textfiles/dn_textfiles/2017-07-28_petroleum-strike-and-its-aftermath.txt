The petroleum strike and its aftermath

The public, no doubt, would have heaved a huge sigh of relief with the ending of the petroleum strike, albeit temporarily. There was large scale dislocation of public life due to the drying up of fuel supplies, with motorists running helter skelter and languishing in long queues to lay their hands whatever is left at the filling stations. The chaos that was caused also resulted in huge traffic congestion, and, what is more, public anger directed at the government for not dealing firmly with the crisis. Fuel being a precious commodity that oils commerce and industry, the overall dislocation, had it been allowed to continue, would have been monumental indeed. What is more, the strike was called at a time the entire nation was reeling from the dengue epidemic. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told parliament: “Ceylon Petroleum Corporation trade unions have stopped work at a time the country is facing a crisis situation when the government and others are making a joint effort to curb the spread of dengue”.
It is clear that the strikers had wanted the maximum damage caused to public life to win over demands that has nothing to do with their pay, facilities or working conditions but based on what was said to be a patriotic call to prevent the government from selling national assets, not giving thought to the fact that the country would have been plunged deep into the mire, burdened as it is with monumental debt, if the strategic Public Private Partnership was not implemented. It is clear that the overtones of the rhetoric uttered by the strikers was in consonance with that of the likes of Wimal Weerawansa and Udaya Gammanpila who are wont to bellow patriotism day in and day out.
The unions are to meet President Maithripala Sirisena next Tuesday for a further round of talks as a follow up to the discussions held with him on Wednesday, after which the strike was suspended. They have vowed to resume their trade union action upon failure to obtain a satisfactory response. For all the rhetoric and displays of bravado, the intervention of the military, under the Essential Service order, no doubt, forced the strikers to cave in and it is as a face saving measure that the trade unions have threatened to continue with the strike if no compromise is reached.
The government, on its part, should not be seen to be giving into pressure tactics by the trade unions, now that it has given a sample of what it is capable of. The unions too, well know, it will not be possible to push their luck, after a taste of the military might that brought the strikers to heel. The government should now not hesitate to go the whole hog and employ the same method in dealing with the other acts of sabotage that are being carried out at the behest of defeated politicians dreaming of a return to power.
No doubt, the public would have reposed confidence in the government that it will similarly deal with the doctors’ strikes too which have now become a regular feature. True, the military have not the ability or competence to tend to the sick, like it did with operating petroleum bowsers. It is this knowledge that has placed the doctors at an advantage, knowing they would be indispensable, come what may. But the government could consider other options, like that suggested by President's Counsel Hemantha Warnakulasuriya for getting down Indian doctors at times of crisis. Some poo phooed this suggestion, arguing that foreign doctors would not be able to communicate with the free health service seeking locals who are generally the poor and uneducated. But there are ways to overcome this hurdle. Appointing interpreters to these doctors would be one such option.
Desperate situations call for desperate remedies. It is clear that determined attempts are being made to provoke the wrath of the public against the government. Crippling public life by a spate of strikes is a sure fire method to show up the feebleness of the government and what we are witnessing today in part of this relentless strategy being worked out with the active support of certain media establishments. The military option adopted by the government should be seen in this light.
The Yahapalanaya regime was elected to serve its full term and attempting to topple it through extra parliamentary methods cannot be condoned in a democracy. The public will be provided the opportunity to effect a change when elections are held after the regime had served its legal term. Up until then the government is well within its right to use all means at its disposal to ensure it carries on unhindered, and, importantly, to see to it that the public are not made to suffer hardship or put in peril. In furtherance of this, it is obliged to use all the tools at its disposal. The call for the intervention of the military in the petroleum strike, therefore, is amply justified on these grounds.
