AIU’s warning saved Sumanthiran’s life: Warnasinghe

TNA Parliamentarian M. Sumanthiran should pay homage to the Security Forces and the Army Intelligence Unit(AIU) for revealing of a conspiracy to murder him, thus saving his life, Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) National Organiser and Western Provincial Councillor Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said.
Warnasinghe said so while addressing a media briefing at the JHU Headquarters yesterday. He added that many key ex-LTTE carders were released during the Rajapaksa regime. He said he was in doubt as to whether those carders were released in accordance with a hidden agenda of the Rajapaksa regime. He further said that the TNA members could live peacefully and act as they wished as a result of the sacrifice of the 26,000 security forces personnel during the three decade war on terrorism.
“Unless TNA MPs do not stop political gambling, they too will be side-lined by the Tamil people themselves,” he said. Warnasinghe further added that there should be no threat to the national security through foreign investments.
