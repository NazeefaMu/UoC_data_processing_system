Over 1,500 dengue cases reported in Batticaloa

The Batticaloa Teaching Hospital Director Dr. M.S. Ibralebbai stated that up to now, four fatalities and 1,576 cases of dengue have been reported. It's depicting the lack of knowledge to the people on how to prevent and eradicate dengue-breeding places.
The previous month of March alone recorded 750 cases of dengue, while last year only 501 cases of dengue were recorded. While efforts must be taken to contain the spread of dengue mosquitoes, householders must not depend on the hospitals to fight dengue—they must fight dengue in their dwellings places and environments.
If dengue fever isn't contained by one to two months, serious consequences will follow. Health authorities and people must take these matters seriously.
