Patients want test results via password-protected websites

US: Most patients prefer receiving the results of sensitive medical tests - such as genetic tests - through password-protected websites or portals rather than by email or letters, a new survey has found.
The survey by Georgetown University Medical Center (GUMC) found that the largest portion of participants was comfortable receiving test results through password-protected websites or portals. The survey of 409 participants did not include in-person communications, researchers said.
The research found that while password-protected web portals are highly preferred, participants don't mind a variety of non in-person communication methods including email, texts or voicemail for receiving results of common tests such as blood cholesterol levels. However, that is not the case for two very sensitive tests - non-HIV sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and genetic test results.
In those cases, receiving the results via a password-protected patient portal/website was highly preferred. “Communication with patients may need to be on a case-by-case basis - every individual may have a personal preference, and there may be a way to indicate those preferences in the patient's record,” said the study's lead researcher, Jeannine LaRocque, assistant professor of human science in the School of Nursing & Health Studies at GUMC.
“The goal of this study was to try to better understand these preferences, so we can improve doctor-patient communication,” said LaRocque.
The survey tested the desirability of seven different methods of non-in-person communication in receiving three different kinds of tests: common tests such as blood cholesterol and colonoscopy results; non-HIV STIs; and genetic testing (predisposition to a disorder, carrier of an inherited gene linked to a disease and a carrier of a genetic disorder).
