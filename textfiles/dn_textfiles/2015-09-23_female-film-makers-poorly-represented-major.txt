Female film-makers poorly represented at major

Film Festivals
Survey reveals just 13% of directors featured at Venice were women, while the Toronto total was 26% New research has established that women film-makers are being sidelined in selection for major film festivals, even in programmes expressly designed to nurture emerging talent.
The data visualisation site Silk.co has posted research on the numbers of women selected at this year's Venice and Toronto film festivals in a survey that will include future events such as the Sundance film festival, the Bafta and Academy awards, and the film component of SXSW. The data, collected by Silk.co data journalist Alice Corona, reveals that, at Venice, just 13% of the directors of films selected were women, while at Toronto women made up 26% of all directors of films at the festival.
Silk also collected data on credited writers, finding that 10% of films at Venice had a woman credited as writer, and 27% at Toronto. However, these figures are incomplete, as large numbers of writing credits could not be ascertained.
Closer analysis of the figures points to other issues. Of the 400-plus films screened at Toronto, only 69 had a female director and credited writer (most of which are due to directors who have a writing credit). This contrasts with the 229 films that had all-male director and writer credits. Toronto's Discovery section, which in the words of festival director Cameron Bailey aims to "uncover thrilling new voices, inspiring storytellers and hidden gems ... from some of the most exciting new directors from around the world", contained only 9% of films by women directors, while the Masters section, a showcase for recently made films by major directors, contained no women at at all.
The overall figures for Venice were even less impressive. Only 9% of films in competition for the Golden Lion were directed by women - though, in contrast to Toronto, 25% of the directors in Venice's "new directions" section, called Orrizonti, were female.
The documentary section of the Toronto film festival, Tiff Docs, appears to be the strongest performer for women in either of the festivals, with 40% of films directed by women, rising to 47% for writing credits.
