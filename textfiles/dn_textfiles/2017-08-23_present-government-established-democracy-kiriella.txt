Present Government established democracy: Kiriella

"Democracy, media freedom, independence of the judiciary and the public service were established by the present Government. Full freedom was established in the university system,” Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
Minister Kiriella was participating in the 25th anniversary celebrations of the Jaffna University, Vavuniya Campus recently.
He said Vice Chancellors were granted freedom to manage universities as independent institutions and steps were taken to develop the sector in keeping with modern standards by providing material and other resources.
"Everyone should dedicate towards maintaining the education of children since they have to take charge of the country's future. University academics should provide the leadership to students in this endeavour," he said.
The Minister said the irony was that even though university academics - professors, lecturers and deans - ought to give leadership towards resolving problems and issues at universities. “But some of them maintained stoic silence,” the minister said.
Minister Kirella said the Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital was taken over by the Government. The SAITM had been in existence since 2011. Students received education in it for the past five years. The Government was not in a position to take it over even though it wanted to do it.
“The reality should be understood by all. No one objected when SAITM was started. Did the doctors parading the streets today protest against it then?” he asked.
“The previous regime granted Rs. 600 million to launch the SAITM. Now five years had passed since it was launched. After the present government assumed office, there were demands to close it down. This proved that a political agenda was behind the demand. It was not about education at all. Those conducting protest campaigns worked for the defeated party at the last elections. This proved that a political hand was behind all these protest campaigns,” he said.
He said a big dialogue was in developed countries such as Britain regarding free education. The governing party demanded increasing charges for education while the Labour Party campaigned for free education.
“Each student in Britain is given 50,000 sterling pounds to complete their University education. They have to repay it to the university after completing the degree and obtaining employment. While this was the situation in a developed country, we as a developing nation should take pride in our ability to provide free education to our students,” the Minister said.
Jaffna district parliamentarians, University Grants Commission Chairman and Dean of the Vavuniya Campus and staff were present.
