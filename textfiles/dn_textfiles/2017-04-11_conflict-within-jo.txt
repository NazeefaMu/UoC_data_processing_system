Conflict within JO?

Joint Opposition’s Ratnapura District MP T. Ranjit Soysa, Janaka Wakkumbura and Vasudewa Nanayakkara were not present at the opening ceremony of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Ratnapura Office last Friday. SLPP Ratnapura office opening ceremony was organized by JO Ratnapura District MP Pavithra Wanniarachchi.
It was opened by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. It is also reported that no messages were sent by MP Ranjith Soysa, MP Janaka Wakkumbura and MP Vasudewa Nanayakkara, and a conflict within the party is suspected.
