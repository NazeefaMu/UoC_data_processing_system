Bring back the HANGMAN and the WHIP


The latest gruesome rape and murder of this young child has indeed shocked our nation. This horrible crime MUST be avenged for its own sake and also for the security of our people. Those responsible have no right to live till the end of their days eating and living at our expense in prison serving life terms; believe me - I was the Chairman of a Prison Inspection Committee, these despicable scoundrels who have been sentenced to death for murder but not been hanged lead a good life inside - a life they no right to after having taken the life or lives of others.
Not a day passes when we do not read of some horrendous murder or of a child being molested or a woman being raped and murdered and of horrific murders at times of whole families (the murder of the Harmer family of Dehiwela by contract killers is just one such instance); the convicted killers are happily living in jail being fed, clothed and maintained at our expense, like a few hundred others. The wretched man convicted of being a party to the murder of the great Neelan Tiruchelvam when asked by me, when he was an inmate of the Kalutara prison, as to whether he regretted that he was a party to the murder of a great man, he laughed, he had no regret and we continue to allow him to live and pay for him to live!!. Are we not ashamed that such things are happening and that the situation is getting worse by the day.
War against crime
No one can deny that there had been an almost complete breakdown of law and order in our country. We have never had such a situation before and this reflects badly on us all, yes it is a sad reflection on the people and the country which boasts of a two thousand five hundred year old civilization.
Why is it that our neighbours such as Singapore and Malaysia do not face this unfortunate situation? In the first instance it is because both countries have retained the death penalty and have punishments to fit the crime. The death penalty is indeed a deterrent. Both countries are also free of the drug menace which has ruined our society with political leaders being drug barons and acting with impunity.
Should not our new government not act NOW. Yes let us act now and not postpone, this should be the motto of our new government if it wishes to make our country safe for us from criminals, but the government cannot do this alone our religious leaders, our school teachers, parents most importantly and all other social groups and most importantly the media should join in this war against crime, we have duty by our country to do this.
Hang the killers
When a court of law orders the death penalty and after the appeals are over, the final order to carry out the sentence must NOT be passed on to the President, the Supreme Court (a bench of three Justices) should order the execution and set the date and time for it; a citizens group could ensure that the Supreme Court order is carried out. If hanging is considered gruesome let us introduce the Syringe as is the practice in many States of the US and in some other countries, those who have taken the lives of others MUST pay with their lives. Today killing a human being is given out to contract killers --- we must put an end to this horrific practice and there is only one way of doing this ---hang the killers.
As for the child molesters and rapists, public lashing is not the only appropriate punishment they must be castrated and one hand amputated so that the public would recognize a rapist when they see one and our Judiciary should have no compunction in ordering such a punishment for fear and shame are indeed deterrents. Let us also have the death sustenance as in Malaysia, Singapore and some other countries for the Drug kings who are poisoning our youth in particular.
The progeny of those who committed the most atrocious mass murders in our countries during the colonial period and more recently in the world during the first and second World Wars, dropped Atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki killing thousands of innocent civilians and are today setting the Middle East on fire to sell their weapons and to control the oil reserves, are preaching to us to do away with capital punishment, let us tell them in no uncertain terms that we were civilized over 2500 years ago when their ancestors were living in caves and that we do not need their advice to manage our affairs.
Here's hoping that our new President, the Prime Minister and his Cabinet and Parliament along with the Judiciary will act now without any further delay to save our country from disaster.
