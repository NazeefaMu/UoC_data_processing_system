A drama teaser dubbed Julius Sneezer!

Back in the Elizabethan era only men could act and so they had to take on both male and female thespian roles. Acting in Elizabeth’s England was frowned upon my many in society as a profession unsuitable for women, as it was rough and rowdy instead of genteel.
As a result, women were not legally permitted to act on the English stage until King Charles II was crowned in the year 1660. Shakespeare and his contemporaries therefore had no choice but to cast young boys in the roles of women, while the men played all the male roles on stage.
convent schools
The same was true in Sri Lankan boys’ schools in the 60s when co-education was confined to the kindergarten. Boys attending ‘Baby Class’ in cloistered convent schools were kicked out as soon as the good sisters thought they were getting a bit too big for their britches.
In primary and secondary school we were made to perform a whole lot of cross-gender roles in the name of Shakespearean drama or any drama for that matter. At the time there were too many boys performing girls’ roles. And obviously the equivalent was true in girls’ school dramatic societies where lasses draped in men’s period Roman costumes performed male roles.
In all such cases if the pants, pantaloons, breeches or togas did not quite fit, neither did the skirts. And so it was when the St. Ben’s Dramatic Society staged its Shakespearean plays. Legendary drama coach ‘Koti’ Wilson insisted that all such plays kept strictly to the straight and narrow versions. The plays were always staged with hardly a deviation from Shakespeare’s original style. The martinet ‘Koti’ Wilson, pounced on his charges at the slightest infraction with tigerish proclivity. Short, squat and dark complexioned his rotund figure belied his lightning agility to rend slap-happy blows to his students.
Bizarre costumes
He would be turning in his grave had he witnessed some of the contemporary adaptations of the genre that were staged subsequently with bizarre modern costumes of the times. His favourite expression to motivate the students was: “You don’t mess with the Great Bard ever.” And Wilson adored the works of Shakespeare just this side of idolatry.
Soon after, the neighbouring Shepherdian Convent was to stage Julius Caesar with an all female-cast. The same girly cast tittered fit to die when some of us sashayed on stage in the guise of women. So we whistled shrilly when the entire feminine shebang presented the Bard’s tale of love, loyalty and betrayal. It was revenge at its sweetest when we reviewed the play in our college magazine ‘The Ben’ referred to the bevy of attractive assassins and the play as a whole as: “Chock full of Babes with Blades.”
professional thespian
I must have been around 16 at the time and was cast as Caesar’s wife Calpurnia, to which I vehemently objected. I was insistent that I play the heroic Mark Anthony because I had studied the role by memory and could spew out the classical funeral oration with the eloquence confidence and panache of a professional thespian. The idea of performing as a flamboyantly effeminate ‘tranny with a fanny’ was anathema to me.
Besides, I argued logically that I did not possess the curvaceous body shape or the chirpy soprano-like voice to play the role with any sort of credibility. But old Wilson was unmoved and I found myself trying on a gown during dress rehearsal. I was aghast when I observed a classmate standing in the backstage changing room nearly naked wearing nothing but panties and a stuffed bra. Our makeup and wardrobe director was a young and pretty kindergarten teacher who insisted she was trying to ‘get the right shape on shapeless boys’ figures’.
The guy Patrick relished the role of Portia and seemed very much at ease in high-heels with an equally female voice that bordered on the right type of squeals. Needless to say he was promptly rechristened Patricia and carried the moniker for the rest of his school career and beyond.
apple lumps
So Okay, I played Calpurnia under duress and tottered the stage dangerously on heels like a child learning to balance on a bicycle with two wheels. That was when tragedy struck the cast. The thespian chosen to play Mark Anthony suddenly contracted a case of mumps and his cheeks resembled apple lumps. In addition, the one playing the title role of Caesar had come down with a sudden cold but with persuasion could still play his allotted role of simply dropping dead on stage.
Now old ‘Koti’ Wilson faced with the dilemma of having no Anthony understudy appealed to me to take on the role I had coveted. But the eleventh hour fix meant that I was to actually play both roles though not at the same time, with a suicidal change-over deadline. I joked that as a cross-dresser I was being forced into being dragooned into a double-crosser.
‘Koti’ Wilsonian
The word ‘drag queen’ hadn’t come into the common lexicon then, although precocious Colombo schoolboys used the fixed Sinhala locution ‘ponnaya’ for any male who even play-acted with exaggerated femininity. There were other hilarious moments during the play proper when conspirator Mettelus Cimber, whose name the naughty cast mispronounced suggestively in the Sinhala vernacular as far from being born a caesarean baby suddenly found the audience snickering as if observing a comedy.
The guy was wearing a watch instead of the usual wristband. The moment he made his exit to the wings he was slapped not on his wrist but his cheeks by an enraged Wilson. He wittily came up with the excuse: “But sir, my watch is all right...It has Roman numerals.”
There were other hilarious faux pas such as when Casper cast as the Soothsayer muffed his opening line by attracting the emperor’s attention calling out: “Hi Caesar!” instead of the original “Hail Caesar!” Needless to say he was whip-slapped for his performance in true ‘Koti’ Wilsonian style.
Then came the tragic assassination scene when a sick Caesar surrounded by the gang of back-stabbing conspirators fell to the floor. He attempted to break his fall by resting on his elbow but someone kicked it and he slumped on the stage muttering: “You brutes! You Brutes!” His “Et Tu Brute” came some 40 seconds after he was supposedly dead! Resuming his position on the stage floor, he lolled his head, drooped his eyelids then shut them presumably for good, but not for long.
His eyelids twitched, and his nose itched and the dead Caesar was suddenly resurrected with a grandfather of all sneezes that reverberated though the hall. No need to state the obvious that the play was referred to as ‘Julius Sneezer’ for as long as one could remember.
