Challenges, opportunities in LG electoral system: WMC

The new mixed Local Government electoral system with a 25 percent quota for women, has brought in new challenges while also opening up space for more women, said the Women and Media Collective (WMC) yesterday.
While 60 percent of the seats under the first-past-the-post system are contested via a ward, only 10 percent of these seats are open to women. “The women have to depend on men to put them on the ward list. And we find that most parties have put their female candidates onto the second or proportional representation list,” explained WMC, Technical Advisor- Programmes and Research, Kumudini Samuel addressing a media briefing at Renuka Hotel, Colpetty.
Winning a ward is an assurance of a seat and the smaller constituency of the ward allows for easier and cheaper campaigning. The majority of the women appointed through the second list will not have a constituency and will not get in if their relevant party does not win enough wards.
The women on the second list thus have to campaign throughout the Local Government body and they have been told by the parties that if they fill the ballot boxes, it would motivate the party to nominate their names when the time comes, said Coordinator Women’s Resource Centre, Sumika Perera.
The WMC has asked for a more regulated method to appoint women into Local Government.
Perera also noted that that there was a trend in not letting women contest a ward even when they have worked for years on behalf of the party.
Out of the 21 Local Bodies in the Kurunegala District, only 3 to 4 women have been nominated by parties to contest a ward, said Perera.
Rural Women’s Front, Sriyani Pathirage suggested that parties appoint female organizers in addition to male, to ensure that the best female candidates are chosen.
“It is a lie that political parties spread when they say that there are no women to contest. There have been so many women at the grassroots who have worked hard and have not been chosen,” said Perera.
When it comes to election related violence, female candidates have fared worse than their male counterparts. While reports of violence against women were not reported widely in the districts of Kurunegala, Galle and other provinces, Viluthu, Centre for Human Resource Development, Executive Director, Maithreyi Rajasingham observed that such cases were being increasingly reported in the North and East.
These female candidates, she said, have also come together across party lines to issue a common manifesto with the main objective of creating a democratic culture within LGs.
