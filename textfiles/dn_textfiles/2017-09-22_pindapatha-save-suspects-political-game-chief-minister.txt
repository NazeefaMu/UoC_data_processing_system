Pindapatha to save suspects, a political game: Chief Minister

The Maha Sangha’s pindapatha campaign to collect money to pay up a fine imposed on suspects found guilty by court, has political connotations, Central Province Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake said.
This has given use to the question whether bhikkhus showing reluctance to fend for their noon meals doing pindapatha rounds to collect money was ethical, he said.
The Chief Minister expressed these sentiments addressing the media at Hotel Topaz Kandy to announce plans made by the Provincial Trade and Tourism Department to mark forthcoming World Tourism Day celebrations recently.
Although Bhikkhus doing pindapatha rounds to collect noon meals was a usual occurrence, doing so to solicit financial contributions was a novel experience for the Buddhist public who suspected an ulterior political motive behind it, the Chief Minister said.
He said although financial contributions were collected to pay up a fine imposed on the world’s first female Prime Minister when she was deprived of civic rights, the members of the Maha Sangha never took part in it.
