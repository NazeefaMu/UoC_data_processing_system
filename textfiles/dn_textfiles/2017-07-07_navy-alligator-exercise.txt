NAVY ALLIGATOR EXERCISE

The Alligator Exercise by Sri Lanka Navy Marines came to a successful end in the Vakarei beach on Wednesday. Over 100 SLN Marines, 30 Commandos and the same number of Special Forces personnel participated in the exercise. The prime motive of the exercise was to amplify the operational readiness, in collaboration with allied forces, to withstand any form of threat posed by an enemy both from the sea and land. SLNS Ranawijaya, Landing Craft 821 and 04 Inshore Patrol Craft were engaged in the exercise.
