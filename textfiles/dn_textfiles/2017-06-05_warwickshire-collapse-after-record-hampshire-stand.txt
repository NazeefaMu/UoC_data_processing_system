Warwickshire collapse after record Hampshire stand

LONDON: Sean Ervine collected a double century and joined Jimmy Adams, another century maker, in the highest stand in the Championship this season before inflicting more misery on Warwickshire as they collapsed in the final session.
Ervine moved from 140 overnight to a sublime 200 to hand his side a first innings total of 515.
But Hampshire domination on the game didn't stop there as they left Warwickshire floundering on 49 for 6 - still 316 behind the follow on.
With blue skies overhead and on the same dry track as the first day, Warwickshire toiled in their reply.
Earlier, Ervine and Adams continued exactly how they left day one as their record fourth wicket stand looked unstoppable. Their records included the highest fourth wicket stand for Hampshire of all time and the top stand of any wicket in Division One this season.
The epic stand was finally broken and Sunny Singh started to chip away with his left arm spin. Adams was the first to depart for a scrappy yet completely chanceless 166 having batted for 502 minutes and 386 balls. A rare attacking shot from Adams was flicked off his legs to midwicket - the colossal stand ending on 367.
Ervine completed his stunning double century, his second for Hampshire and the third of his career, but was out just three runs later. The Zimbabwean attempting a reverse paddle but missed Singh's low slow bounce.
The light for Warwickshire was quickly dimmed again as debutant Ian Holland added 61 for the seventh wicket with Lewis McManus, with the hosts still yet to accelerate. McManus did club a massive six over square leg before Holland was lbw and he was caught at first slip while attempting to slog.
Crane was yorked first ball handing Singh his maiden professional five wicket haul. Singh picked up a sixth when Gareth Berg clubbed to the long on boundary, before Andrew Usmeed grabbed his first career scalp to wrap up the innings. But after their evening heroics, Hampshire look in a great position to win back-to-back for the first time this seasons.
