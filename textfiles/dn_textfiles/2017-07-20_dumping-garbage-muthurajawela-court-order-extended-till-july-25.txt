Dumping garbage at Muthurajawela: Court order extended till July 25

 
The Supreme Court today extended the interim order issued preventing the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) from dumping garbage at the Muthurajawela Sanctuary until July 25.
Chief Justice Priyasath Dep and Justice Upaly Abeyratne issued the interim order preventing the CMC or any other authority from dumping garbage at Muthurajawela on July 6, pursuant to a fundamental rights petition filed by 35 five residents in the close proximity to Muthurajawela Sanctuary.
The petitioners cited Colombo Municipal Council (CMC), CMC Municipal Commissioner, Urban Development Authority (UDA), Central Environment Authority (CEA), the Wattala Pradeshiya Sabha and six other parties as respondents.
The petitioners further stated that the petitioners and their families and other residents in close proximity to Muthurajawela Sanctuary are severely affected and will continue to be affected by this dumping.
The petitioners further stated that the area in question is declared a sanctuary under the Flora and Fauna Protection Act by the gazette dated 31.10.1996 in recognition of its vast bio-diversity.
