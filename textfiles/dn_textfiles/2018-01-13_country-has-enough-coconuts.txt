'Country has enough coconuts'

The country has produced enough coconuts for consumption, sources from the Hector Kobbekaduwa Agrarian Research and Training Institute said.
The sources said the high price of a coconut is recorded these days due to traders' attempt to earn a high profit.
Sri Lanka needs around 2,000 million coconuts annually.
The sources said the coconut harvest dropped by 20 percent in 2017 compared to the previous year's production. Adverse weather and sale of coconut lands to construct houses are two main reasons for the drop, the sources said.
