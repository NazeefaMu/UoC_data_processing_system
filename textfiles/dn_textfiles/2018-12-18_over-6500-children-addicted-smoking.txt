Over 6,500 children addicted to smoking

According to a latest survey conducted by the Health and Education sectors in Sri Lanka, it has been revealed that more than 6,500 schoolchildren who are between 10-17 years are found to have addicted to smoking, Kurunegala District Senior Education Director, W.M.Balasooriya said.
He was speaking at a meeting he had with deputy school heads of the Kurunegala district at the Kurunegala Education office yesterday.
Accordingly, a number of educational programmes have been planned for students at school level countrywide under the patronage of Presidential Secretary, Udaya R. Seneviratne.
The Secretary of the President issued a circular informing all provincial and zonal Education Directors countrywide to conduct a special ‘Narcotics Control School Week’ from December 21 to January 25 in all schools.
All school principals, teachers and parents would be instructed to organise these programmes to educate students on impact of addiction for drugs and smoking in order to save children from harmful drug menace that ruins children.
‘Everyone has to get together to make this effort a success,’ he added.
