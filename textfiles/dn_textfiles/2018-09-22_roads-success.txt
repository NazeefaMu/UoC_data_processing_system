Roads to success

Roads bring people together and markets closer. Ever since the Romans first built the roads, they have helped humanity to connect distant places with each other. The main impetus for the development of roads in the 20th century was the rapid rise of the motor car in the 1930s. In Sri Lanka, most of the roads were built by the British to facilitate trade in tea and other commodities. Sri Lanka has around 12,500 Km of paved roads, counting the new expressways but not counting rural motorable gravel roads. This compares favourably with the road networks of many developing countries of similar size.
Not all roads are equal, though. There are many rural and even urban roads riddled with potholes and other obstructions, which are badly in need of repair. Some roads clearly have to be widened given the increased flow of vehicles (there are more than seven million in circulation) and also the economic importance of the respective areas. Not a day goes by without a news item on a TV channel about a village that has no proper access roads or bridges and the schoolchildren have to wade in the river to go to school. These villages deserve priority in road building and expansion plans.
Now the USA has come forward to assist Sri Lanka to upgrade some of its roads. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) compact would improve road networks and the bus system in the Colombo Metropolitan Region, and improve road connectivity between the central region and ports and markets in the Western Province. The compact would upgrade more than 300 kilometres of urban and interprovincial roads.
A delegation from the U.S. Government’s MCC, led by Chief Operating Officer Jonathan Nash, visited Sri Lanka this week to continue progress on the proposed MCC compact – a large-scale five-year grant programme. MCC is developing the compact in partnership with the Government of Sri Lanka. The proposed MCC Sri Lanka Compact is in the final stage of development and is expected to be negotiated with the Government of Sri Lanka in the coming weeks. MCC will fund the compact entirely through grants which do not need to be repaid rather than loans that have to be paid back, sometimes with a high interest. This is a welcome development in the backdrop of “debt trap” accusations floating around.
Based on an analysis of Sri Lanka’s economy and the constraints that are holding back private investment and growth, MCC expects to invest in more projects proposed by the Government of Sri Lanka in transport and land sectors. The MCC established in 2004 has signed compacts with 29 countries around the world. In December 2016, MCC’s Board of Directors selected Sri Lanka to develop a compact and two years later, the road system has been selected for improvement.
Colombo does have many good and even excellent roads, but if you go into deeper parts of the City, the roads are not in a very good condition. These have not been repaired or re-surfaced in years. The MCC and local officials should indentify these roads for inclusion in the programme. The use of very narrow roads by heavy vehicles has exacerbated the problem as they damage the road surface and create traffic congestion. The latter is a problem experienced all over Colombo, even outside rush hours on some roads. Some roads in heavily residential areas, however, cannot be widened any further to accommodate more vehicles. Several alternatives have been proposed to reduce traffic congestion – including a congestion charge for vehicles entering Colombo and alternative highways built on concrete pillars. The latter will be a common sight in 5-6 years as plans are underway to link Colombo with Malabe and Piliyandala through such roads.
The ideal alternative is encouraging public transport. The Malabe-Colombo Light Rail Transit (LRT) will be a reality soon and by 2035 or so we will be able to see seven LRT lines in operation. LRT trains are generally comfortable, spacious, clean, punctual and efficient, five attributes which are not found at all in our chaotic public transport (bus, rail, tuk tuk) system. The LRT must be heavily promoted as an alternative to the car, at least in terms of heading to work. It should ideally be able to take at least 1,000 cars of the road during morning and evening rush hours.
While not as efficient or comfortable as a future LRT, buses are far easier and less costly to deploy. The Sri Lanka Transport Board is already looking for low-floor AC electric buses to increase the appeal of buses to those who prefer the car. This too should ideally result in fewer cars on our congested roads. In this context, the MCC’s inclusion of grants for improving bus services in Colombo is a laudable initiative. A bus map of Colombo should also be developed for the convenience of tourists. It is also vital to coordinate the running of private and Government-owned buses under a single timetable. Our public transport system needs a long-term fix and we hope the MCC Compact will rise to the occasion.
