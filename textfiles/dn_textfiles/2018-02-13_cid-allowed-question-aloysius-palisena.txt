CID allowed to question Aloysius, Palisena

The Colombo Fort Magistrate yesterday permitted the CID to record statements from Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius and its Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena for a period of three days in connection with the controversial Central Bank Bond issue. Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne made this order consequent to a request by the CID that they are expecting to record further statements from Aloysius and Palisena who are in remand custody over a magisterial inquiry pertaining to the Central Bank Bond issue.
The Magistrate permitted the CID to record statements from the two suspects between February 13 and 15 at the Welikada Remand Prison.
On February 5, the two suspects were ordered to be further remanded till February 16 by Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne.
Filing its first B report before the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court regarding the Central Bank Bond issue on February 27, 2015, the CID on February 2 named former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran, Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius and its Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena and the PTL as suspects in the case.
