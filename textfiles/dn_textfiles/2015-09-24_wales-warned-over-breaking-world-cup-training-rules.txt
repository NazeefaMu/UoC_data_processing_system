Wales warned over breaking World Cup training rules

Rugby's governing body World Rugby on Thursday issued an official warning to Wales for drafting in players from outside their World Cup squad for training sessions.
Teams are only allowed to utilise the 31 players in their declared squads.
Injury-hit Wales are believed to have drafted in the extra players at a training session on Wednesday.
