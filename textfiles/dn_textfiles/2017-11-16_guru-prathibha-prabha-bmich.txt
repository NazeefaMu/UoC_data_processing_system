Guru Prathibha  Prabha at BMICH

A heart touching video titled Guru Panduru was shared extensively on social media recently. Inspired by a true story, the video was conceptualized by Rainco as a tribute to Teachers to coincide with Guru Prathibha Prabha, the National Felicitation Ceremony for Teachers.
The event was held recently at the BMICH with the attendance of the Speaker Deshabandu Karu Jayasuriya as the Chief Guest along with the Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam and Education State Minister V. Radhakrishnan.
Organized by the Ministry of Education, the National Felicitation Ceremony Guru Prathibha Prabha aims to pay tribute to those special teachers we encounter, who have made a lasting impression on our lives. It is a ceremony of ovation for teachers who have contributed to enrich lives of students in remarkable ways.
Four hundred teachers, principals and pirivena lecturers representing educational institutes were felicitated at the ceremony.
“It has been an honour for Rainco to be associated with Guru Prathibha Prabha, which felicitates teachers,an idea close to us as a brand and core-product.
Teachers play an important role in nurturing our future generation, but there are no large scale events where they are recognized for their silent services.
A child’s mind is molded, not only through the lessons they learn in the classroom, but also the lessons of humanity, compassion, respect and creativity. It is the teachers who are mainly responsible in inculcating these into a young mind.
In the words of Michael Marpurgu ‘It is the teacher that makes the difference, not the classroom,” commented Rainco Private Limited, CEO, Aroos Ahmed.
