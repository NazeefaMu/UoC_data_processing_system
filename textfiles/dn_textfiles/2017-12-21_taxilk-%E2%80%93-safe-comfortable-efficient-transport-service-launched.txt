Due to the unavailability of a standard fare facility and an established and steady taxi service the customers are faced with many and varied problems and day by day their trust in these transport systems are being eroded.
To overcome this taxi.lk was launched in Sri Lanka recently.
With advances in technology day to day life has been made easier with the advent of mobile phones. Now the highly competitive taxi hire service business is also faced with using this communication technology to suit their requirements. Therefore, there is a facility to get vehicles to wherever the customers need them within a matter of minutes. Due to standard fare structure, a safe, efficient and trustworthy service, with the ability to map out the fastest and shortest route governed by mobile apps – taxi hire services have become immensely popular in towns and adjacent areas.

To counter these problems Taxi.lk Global (Pvt) Ltd takes pride in introducing Taxi.lk the latest cab hire service which is also islandwide, trustworthy and truly efficient unfolding a new chapter in Taxi hire transport facilities.
