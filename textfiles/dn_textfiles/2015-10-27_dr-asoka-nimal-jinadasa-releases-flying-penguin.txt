Dr. Asoka Nimal Jinadasa releases: 'Flying Penguin'

Success is an elusive prey. Many people devote their life and efforts to tackling its many complexities. Some obtain it the hard way while others seem privileged enough to achieve it with little effort. There are no sure ways to success, or are there? Award-winning life coach and author Dr. Asoka Nimal Jinadasa argues that anyone can navigate his or her way to success using a proven and tested method. This is outlined in his intriguing self-help book, "Flying Penguin - How to Create Miracles in Your Life Using the Six Dimensions of Success" (published by Partridge Singapore), that introduces the concept of the six dimensions of success.
The six dimensions of success consist of the heart, mind, body, passion, focus and health. These core dimensions, the author affirms, are innate in every human being. By developing competencies associated with each of these fundamental areas, individuals will be able to unleash their full potential. This will give them the power to successfully navigate their lives in any direction they desire. This book discusses simple concepts and techniques that work, drawn from diverse sources such as Oriental martial arts, Tibetan rites and Himalayan wisdom, combined with the latest research in neuroscience, genetics, behavioral psychology, nutrition and healthcare. The book uses the flying penguin as an interesting metaphor for breaking free and flying beyond the limitations of daily life in order to manifest any new reality that is deeply desired.
Jinadasa encourages his readers to awaken the vast inborn human potential mostly sleeping within them, break and mold, and lead a full and happy, fulfilling life.
