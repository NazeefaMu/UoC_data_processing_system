Marking the beginning of Avurudu with Bibikkan

 
The Grand Kandyan hotel began its Sinhala & Hindu New Year celebrations with a fun filled coconut cake (Bibikkan) mixing ceremony. The General Manager along with Executive staff & Kitchen Brigade of the hotel geared up with caps and gloves to put their hands in and mix the dry fruits, Juggery, coconut treacle and other ingredients beautifully laid out on a table.
The Grand Kandyan family looks forward to celebrating the joy of Sinhala & Hindu New Year with everyone.
