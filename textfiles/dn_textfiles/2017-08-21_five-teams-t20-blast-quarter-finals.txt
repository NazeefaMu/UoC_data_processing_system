Five teams into T20 Blast quarter-finals

LONDON, Saturday - Cameron Delport's unbeaten 109 helped Leicestershire reach the T20 Blast quarter-finals with a thrilling two-run victory over Nottinghamshire. The Foxes made 203-5 from their 20 overs, with the hosts falling just short of the target on 201-8.
Warwickshire beat Lancashire, and Derbyshire also progressed from the North Group by beating Worcestershire.
In the South Group, wins for Somerset and Surrey helped them join Glamorgan and Hampshire in the knockout stages. Yorkshire, second heading into the night, were knocked out, having needed two of Warwickshire, Derbyshire and Leicestershire to lose, plus a draw or defeat for Northamptonshire.
Leicestershire needed a win to guarantee their progression having started the night in fifth place, level on points with Yorkshire, Birmingham in third and Derbyshire in fourth.
Leicestershire lost New Zealand international Luke Ronchi with only 10 runs on the board, but Delport, who had yet to reach 50 in the T20 Blast before the night, put the hosts in control.
The Australian hit nine fours and six sixes in his 59-ball innings, with Mark Cosgrove (37) and Ned Eckersley (30) also making valuable contributions.
Samit Patel raced to 39 from 18 balls, before Dan Christian smashed 73 from 32 deliveries for Nottinghamshire, who had already guaranteed top spot before their final game. Nottinghamshire will host Somerset in the quarter-finals, while Leicestershire's reward is a trip to Glamorgan.
The teams from third to ninth in the South Group were separated by only two points heading into the final round of games, with every side down to eighth-placed Essex maintaining hopes of qualification.
Somerset started the night in seventh but cruised to victory over second-placed Hampshire thanks to Peter Trego's unbeaten 84 from 50 balls, followed by a brilliant bowling performance.
The visitors made 189-3 at Southampton, before Hampshire collapsed to 91 all out from 18.3 overs, with Roelof van der Merwe and Craig Overton each taking three wickets. The victory, coupled with losses for Middlesex, Sussex and Kent, was enough to take Somerset to fourth in the table. Sussex narrowly missed out on the knockout stages as, despite a 55-run win over Essex, they missed out on a top-four spot because of an inferior net run-rate, 0.423 to Somerset's 0.491. South Group leaders Glamorgan were already assured of a place in the last eight, and they impressed again in a rain-affected game against Middlesex at Cardiff. Third-placed Surrey progressed with a 10-run victory over fourth-placed Kent, thanks in large part to England batsman Jason Roy's 78 from 43 balls.
Roy struck 10 fours and three sixes as he carried the Surrey innings, with no other batsman making more than 20. In a low-scoring game, Rikki Clarke then took 4-16 to help limit Kent to 144-8 and set up a quarter-final against Warwickshire.
