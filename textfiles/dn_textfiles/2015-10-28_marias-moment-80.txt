Maria's moment @ 80!

For opening scenes in cinema, there's nun better than Maria's: Moment Julie Andrews character waltzes across the Austrian landscape and starts singing named best film entrance of all time
* Sound of Music opening scene voted best film entrance of all time
* Omar Sharif awarded second for camel entrance in Lawrence of Arabia
* Dame Julie Andrews reappeared in fifth place for Mary Poppins
It's a scene everyone knows even if they haven't seen the film - Maria the nun waltzes across the Austrian landscape and then launches into song in The Sound Of Music.
Now that moment from the popular 1965 movie starring Julie Andrews has been voted the best film entrance of all time in a poll.
The film, based on the real life story of the Von Trapp family in 1930s Austria, is not the only one to land Dame Julie Andrews in the Top 10.
She was also awarded number five for her neat decent by umbrella into the lives of the Banks family, in musical film, Mary Poppins.
The popular actress and singer has stolen the hearts of the nation across her five decade stint in the industry. And she proved that she is still as popular as ever, after securing almost a third of the 1,300 votes cast in the Radio Times survey.

			lives of the Banks family in Mary Poppins, came fifth
Despite her popularity, Miss Andrews, now 80, was not the only person to secure their spot in the Top 10, revealed today.
The new Star Wars film is due to hit the big screen in less than two months, but fans proved they haven't forgotten about the old films during the survey.
The star cruiser gliding overhead in a galaxy far, far, away in Star Wars Episode IV was voted number four in the poll.
It was the only inanimate object to reach the Top 10, though the flying saucer in Close Encounters and the ship in 2001: a Space Odyssey, found themselves in the Top 100.
Daniel Craig has dominated the headlines of late as Bond film, Spectre, in which he plays 007, was screened at a Royal premiere last night.
But it was actually the first ever Bond film, Dr No, released in 1962, that found itself in the Top 10. Sean Connery was awarded the seventh best entrance, as he introduces himself for the first time as 'Bond. James Bond.', at a card table.
Late Omar Sharif was awarded second place, for his renowned entrance on camel back in the hit film Lawrence of Arabia.
