The best of France and Sri Lanka on exhibit

The Le Petit Futé tourist guide will be launched as part of the French Spring Festival on July 11 at 6pm at the Alliance Française de Kotte. The best of France and Sri Lanka will be exhibited at the event. You will discover the secrets of a perfect journey through these countries.
This meeting will be divided in two presentations: First Roxane Lamouille, a French writer of Le Petit Futé, will focus on France and its most famous touristic sites and attractions.
Then, Françoise Houet and Chamika Kathri Arachchige, both directors of tourist agencies (Shanti Travel and Atypique Lanka), will unveil the secrets of Sri Lanka. Since tourism does not exclude art, you will enjoy a preview of the photography exhibition on Sri Lanka of the artist Cédric Gatillon that will take place in August.
