Ratnayake submitted the proposal in this regard at the last meeting of the Provincial Council and explained that 2,000 cows would be imported from Australia to distribute among farmers. He said one factory would produce milk powder, butter, cheese, yogurt and pure liquid milk and another would be established to produce composed and liquid manure for sugar cane cultivation. The project will provide direct employment opportunities for nearly 2,000 people and indirect employments for another 2,500, he said.
An American has provided 15-year interest free USD 350 million grant to promote agriculture, education and industries of developing countries, he said.
“A factory will be established for recycling garbage. It will recycle garbage collected from the Badulla and Moneragla districts and will take steps to produce electricity via garbage in future,” he said..
“Two offices will be opened in Badulla and Moneragala to collect garbage for the factory. At the initial stage, the company will recruit 20 degree holders and 25 advance level passed youths.The two offices will be monitored by the Provincial Council,” he said.
The proposal was approved and copies of the same were sent to the Prime Minister and the Industry Development Minister.
