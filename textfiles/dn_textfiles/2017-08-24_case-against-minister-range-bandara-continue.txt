Case against Minister Range Bandara to continue

The Colombo High Court yesterday commenced recording evidence in a case filed against Skills Development and Vocational Training State Minister Palitha Range Bandara and another person for allegedly aiding abetting to present a vehicle registration permit for an illegally assembled vehicle.
When the case came up before High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga, the first witness Dinesh Ratnayake gave evidence and further trial fixed for August 25.
Meanwhile, the defence counsel appearing on behalf of State Minister informed Court that the complainant party had tendered an affidavit to the Attorney General citing that the complainant has no intention to proceed with the case. Defence Counsel Savithri Fernando appearing under the instructions of U.R. de Silva PC moved court that the case be fixed for another date since his client wants to attend Parliament sessions.
However, High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga decided to commence trial in the early hours as Parliament sessions begin at 1 pm.
The prosecution informed Court that the Attorney General is expecting to make his opinion regarding the defence claims that the case cannot be maintained.
“The Attorney General is perusing the facts presented by both defence and complainant regarding the maintainability of the case,” Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake said.
