Rock on!

Singer, composer and producer Chitral ‘Chity’ Somapala is a flame that burns bright. Outstanding Personalities features Chitral who prefers to let his powerful music do the talking.
 Q. Chitral you are a hard rock, heavy metal and power metal vocalist. Why do these forms of music appeal to you? Why are you passionate about these forms of music?
A. As a teenager I’ve been into this type of music because I’ve always wanted to do something different than the regular music in Sri Lanka. I’m passionate about it because of the complexity of various rhythms and then again this music comes from western classical music.
Q. You have performed with European power metal bands such as Firewind, Power Quest, Avalon, Faro, Red Circuit and Civilization One, Rekuiem and Domain. These are powerful bands. What was it like performing with them? It must have been an exciting and tremendous experience performing with them?
A. Yes Indeed, I had a responsible role in all these bands, not only as a lead singer because I was involved in composing melodies, writing lyrics and album concepts. We toured all over the world as a support for well -known acts and also we did Headliner Tours and gained positive criticism.
Q. You released your Sinhala track “Nadee Ganga” in 1998. What kind of impact did that have on your career?
A. I never expected that it would go that far. Initially I refused, because I’ve never sung in Sinhala till that moment, but then again my wife said just go for it, you never know, and that is the result!
Q. Chitral, what really inspires you to perform? From where does this incredible talent come from?
A: I love art and music. When performing I don’t think about fame like some other artistes. I completely get lost inside my soul and that’s the outcome. To put it simply it is my dedication and love for music.
Q. You come from a musical family. What kind of influence did that have on your formative years?
A. As a teenager I wasn’t into music at all, I was just a listener. My parents never influenced us to do music, but somehow it happened, because I always felt music has a specialty and I always wanted to be different from the others with what I did.
Q. At the age of 17 you entered the nightclub circuit in Colombo. At such a young age, did you feel a certain amount of pressure?
Yes a bit. Senior Western musicians were fascinated by my talent, and that was a great learning experience engaging with the experienced ones.
Q. In 1985 you joined the Sri Lankan band “Shock”. Was that the point in your career when you seriously considered entering hard rock, heavy metal and power metal?
I still say that playing with Diliup Gabadamudalige, I learnt a lot about differences in music. We played all original songs written by him in this band, and then I was able to write my own baselines with his guidance. All in all, that opened doors for my career to be an overall musician and not just a sideman.
Q. You joined Avalon, a German power band as front man and lead singer. Avalon’s third album, Vision Eden, went viral receiving excellent reviews. The Vision Eden tour saw Avalon as a support act for bands such as Hammer Fall, Uriah Heep, Metallica, Motörhead, Royal Hunt, Pink Cream 69, and many others. During the summer of 2000, you participated on Avalon’s 4th album Eurasia. What was it like performing on this tour? Was that a defining moment in your career?
A. That was the turning point of power metal in the world. We performed in so many great festivals and then we also became the best newcomer band in Netherlands and we became the band of the month in France on so many fanzines and I must say it was great.
Q. Who are the musicians you admire? Who are the musicians who have inspired you and are there any songs that you have listened to that stands out in your mind?
A. I admire all good musicians from classical music, jazz, rock, new age, film-scores to everything under the sun. The boundaries are limitless, but then again I dislike fake musicians and musicians who are greedy for commercialism.
Q. What do you consider the milestones in your life Chitral? The milestones you have achieved in your career?
A: I’m a person who loves nature. I’m a very simple person but I don’t like fake people and I always try to get rid of them and just mind my own business. I’m a very straight forward person too. To me, life is a circle and it’s a never ending learning process.
Q. What do you consider the significant achievements in your career?
A. To be on stage with great human beings and great musicians, then I feel that I’m embracing the entire world.
Q. What is your message to the youth?
A. Not to be swollen headed, learn about life everyday and respect elders.
Q. Apart from music, what are the other pursuits and hobbies in your life?
Cooking is a big hobby in my life. I love cooking Sri Lankan meals because it’s very authentic and each one of us have different methods and that shows we are all different people.
Q. What are your expectations for the future?
Peace to the entire world, let us stop hatred, stop racism, because human beings are so fragile and we are all the same, except certain religions and races have separated us. But then again our hearts should beat as one and we should come together as one.
