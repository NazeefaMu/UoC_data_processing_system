White man's tomb in Yala

There is the tomb of a white man at Galge about 12 kilometers off Kataragama near Buttala Kataragama road in the Yala jungle.
According to Karunasena Vithana, a retired Kataragama Wildlife Range Officer, the man named J.P.Ireshan was a hunter. He liked hunting wild elephants. He has killed more than 100 elephants. But as an irony, he was also killed by a wild elephant.
His friends erected a tomb on the rock where he was killed.
Karunasena said the pillar of the tomb was about 40 feet high. But from time to time, it has been subject to lightning strikes.
Its height has been reduced to about 20 feet to avoid lightning.
The British government maintains the tomb.
