Madubhani Perera, Director/Marketing commented, “Sri Lanka is one of the preferred destinations for Gulf tourists as we offer a distinctive, adventure-packed, eco-friendly, family-focused experience and offering. With our rich nature, heritage and culture, year-round schedule of festivals and special events, numerous parks and eco centers, luxury resorts and wellness centres, Sri Lanka has many reasons for GCC families to return to Sri Lanka again and again.”
During 2016, Sri Lanka received a total of 107,635 tourists from Middle East region where 13,268 Omani Tourists have travelled to Sri Lanka while 5726 Kuwaiti tourists, 2887 Bahraini tourists and 1709 Qatari tourists visiting the country, Sri Lanka aims to double these numbers and achieve 20 percent increase from Middle East region.
Perera further commentated “Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman and Qatar remain integral target markets for Sri Lanka’s tourism development”.
“The upcoming roadshow is one of many major activities Sri Lanka tourism conducts to ensure that key international travel agents maintain a close awareness and link with Sri Lanka’s tourism industry partners, in order to mutually expand the business opportunities between both, while offering their clients quality tourism experiences. Through such a mission to four GCC countries our expectations are that travel to Sri Lanka from these markets will continue to grow and thrive, reinforcing Sri Lanka’s status as a world-class destination for eco-tourism, cultural and family tourism,” he added.
The Sri Lanka Tourism promotional roadshow kicked off at the JW Marriott Kuwait on October 15, before moving on to Downtown Rotana Bahrain on October 16, Intercontinental Muscat on October 17 and finishing up at the Marriott Marquis Doha City Center on October 18.
