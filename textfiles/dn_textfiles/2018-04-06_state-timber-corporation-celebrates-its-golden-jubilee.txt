State Timber Corporation celebrates its golden jubilee

President Maithripala Sirisena said that plans are afoot to increase the forest density to 32 percent from 28 percent within the next three year period.
The President made these remarks on April 4 at BMICH, while addressing the employees of State Timber Corporation, which marks the golden jubilee. The State Timber Corporation (STC) has marked its 50th anniversary this year since its inception in 1968. The President while addressing the gathering said that it is needed to increase the forest density to 32 percent so as to minimise the climatic changes of the country. According to environmental experts, the country needs to have a rate of 32 percent forest density, though the present forest density rate is 28 percent.
“Therefore a three year action plan to increase forest density to 32 percent will be implemented soon” he said.
The President advised the STC to invest on reforestation, so as to maintain the balance situation of the environment. He further added that the present volume of import of foreign timber should be increased, aiming to save our forests and forest reserves.
President Sirisena further said that one third of the country is affected by a severe drought, which has been prevailing for more than three years. As an outcome of this situation, food production of the country has dropped. Due to the drought, the government has to import more food items including rice. The President pointed out that the world has reached a highly advanced technological level but even that advanced technology cannot heal the damages of environmental impact.
Speaking on future plans of the STC, the President advised the officials to work for achieving set goals. Meanwhile, he asked the officials to increase the number of plant beds maintained by STC for reforestation. Besides, he advised to increase and streamline the furniture manufacturing of the STC.
At the Golden Jubilee ceremony, many senior employees of the STC received gold medals as a service appreciation by the President.
