Wild elephants causing fear in Ampara

Wild elephants have invaded the villages of Nintavur, Karaitivu, Mavadippalli, Sainthamaruthu and Sammanthurai, residents of the areas complain.
Residents are in fear and unable to chase them away as they visit after dusk in massive numbers.
The elephants invade and destroy the paddy cultivation, domestic crops, houses, boundary walls, coconut gardens and stocks of paddy stored in the houses, the residents said.
They added that they had to stay in jungles during nights and their children are unable to concentrate on their studies due to the fear of wild elephants. People urge authorities to take immediate action to protect them from the invasion of wild elephants.
