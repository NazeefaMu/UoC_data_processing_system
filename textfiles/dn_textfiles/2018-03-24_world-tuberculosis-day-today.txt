World Tuberculosis Day today

The World TB (Tuberculosis) Day falls today. This year's theme is “Wanted: Leaders for a TB-free world”. The TB walk will take place today (Saturday, March 24 ) at 7.30 am at Independence Square, Colombo 7 under the patronage of Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, the Health Ministry Spokesman said.
Sri Lanka has around 13,000 TB patients. Of them, only around 8,511 were detected and undergo treatment. Of them, 8,113 were newly identified cases. Sri Lanka has around 4,500 unidentified TB patients and they actively spread the disease.
The World Health Organization (WHO) says TB continues to be the top infectious killer worldwide, claiming over 4,500 lives a day. The emergence of multi drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) poses a major health security threat and could risk gains made in the fight against TB. Last year, WHO reported that 10.4 million people fell ill with TB and that 2016 reported 1.8 million TB deaths. The disease is deeply rooted in populations where human rights and dignity are limited.
While anyone can contract TB, the disease thrives among people living in poverty, marginalised communities and groups.They include: migrants, refugees, ethnic minorities, miners and others working and living in risk-prone settings, the elderly, marginalised women and children in many settings. Malnutrition, poor housing and sanitation, compounded by other risk factors such as tobacco and alcohol use and diabetes increase people's vulnerability to TB and affect their access to care, WHO says.
