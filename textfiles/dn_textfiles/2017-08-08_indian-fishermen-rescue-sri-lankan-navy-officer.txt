Indian fishermen rescue Sri Lankan Navy officer

 
Indian fishermen on Monday rescued a Sri Lankan Navy officer off the coast of Tamil Nadu, mistaking him for the boat-owner's son - who had jumped overboard in a panic after the officer's vessel theatened to fire at them if they tried to escape.
The officer, Vijaya Singa, had tripped and fallen into the sea after the Navy vessel collided with the boat, whose crew - led by proprietor Ganesan - was fishing with banned double fold nets.
The fishermen had agreed to surrender.
But after helping Vijaya Singa climb aboard (thinking he was Ganesan's son Balamurugan) they began to speed away.
As the Navy vessel gave chase, its crew realised Vijaya Singa was on the Indian boat, and immediately alerted the Intelligence Bureau at Rameswaram.
It wasn't until Ganesan's boat was surrounded nearly three hours later that he and his men realised who they'd rescued. They were detainedat Kangesam.
Balamurugan was arrested on Nayina, a Sri Lankan island.
Charges of damaging a Sri Lankan Navy vessel and illegal fishing were brought against Ganesh and his men, and Balamurugan was charged with illegal entry.
The Lankan Navy hasn't official confirmed the incident, presumably to avoid embarrassment.
However, it has admitted that Vijaya Singa fell into the sea, and said he's being treated in a medical camp at Kangesam Naval port.
