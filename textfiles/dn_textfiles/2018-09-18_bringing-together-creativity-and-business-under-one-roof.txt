Bringing together creativity and business under one roof

The premier private education provider, Raffles Education Corporation is once again in the spotlight opening avenues for aspiring young individuals. Raffles Sri Lanka gives students the opportunity to explore creativity and business under one roof with the launch of the Business Administration program.
The business program at Raffles intends on producing professionals capable of administering social and ethical responsibilities, analytical skills, competitiveness and entrepreneurship in business. In addition to coaching students to develop creative and critical problem solving skills necessary to be effective business leaders and executives, the program also aims to nurture students to become confident and coherent future leaders.
“The business education program at Raffles College of Design and Business (RCDB) focuses on the practical aspects of business science. Students will not only learn to see business from a theoretical and research perspective but also the reality in the market and how to achieve the desired business goals. Elements of creativity and analytical thinking will play a major role in the learning process at Raffles,” said Johannes Silaban, College Director for Raffles College of Design and Business.
The business program can be followed in the form of a Diploma or an advanced diploma with the Raffles College of Higher Education being the awarding body. The diploma focusing on business studies functions as an introductory program to prepare students for entry into Advanced Diplomas in business specializations and can be completed in a span of 6 months. The Advanced Diploma spanning a period of 12 months offers diplomas in Entrepreneurship and Small Business Operations, Tourism and Hospitality Management, Supply Chain and Logistic Operations and Marketing.
“Our course has more pragmatic elements than theoretical elements and we believe in that if there’s a will there is always a way and the willpower comes from confidence. Raffles College of Design and Business works towards helping students develop these skills,” said Sajith Gaffoor, the Business Program Coordinator.
Having intakes in the months of January, April, July and October for both, the Diploma and Advanced Diploma, RCDB is giving students the opportunity to thrive in the field of business by beginning their journey at Raffles. Growing to operate in 25 colleges and universities in 23 cities across 13 countries in Asia – Pacific, Middle East and Europe, students are given the convenience of completing subjects in different countries where the same programs are taught.
