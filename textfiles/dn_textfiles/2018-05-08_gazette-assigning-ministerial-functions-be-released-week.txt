Gazette assigning Ministerial functions to be released this week

The Gazette Notification assigning subjects and functions of the ministers after the recent Cabinet reshuffle is expected to be released this week.
Secretary to the President Austin Fernando yesterday said he was hopeful that the Gazette Notification will be released within this week. The notification will include the new departments, constitutional institutes and boards that will come under the purview of the new Ministries.
 The new Cabinet of ministers of the Unity Government were sworn-in before President Maithripala Sirisena on May 1, following the fourth Cabinet reshuffle.
Several ministerial portfolios changed hands while some ministers retained their previous portfolios.
The new State and Deputy Ministers were sworn-in the following day.
