Social dignity, her right

The land is a source of livelihood and the land rights are increasingly recognised as a fundamental factor to the social and economic well-being of the people. Nowadays, land issues are of particular concern when population growth and high food prices have an impact on climate changes. Moreover, women’s land rights tend to be restricted. Women are traditionally at a distinct disadvantage in terms of economic affluence because they earn lesser than men and tend to own fewer assets. Empowering women to help her reach financial independence is important. It is also essential to improve women's land security.
The rural primary responsibility is childcare, preparing food with extra burdens such as collecting firewood. Women’s employment and economic prospects are limited. Anaemia is widespread among female plantation workers in Sri Lanka. Generally, the plantation women eat whatever remained after the men and children had been fed even during her pregnancy. This means that they are undernourished, thus producing weak and underweight children.
Education for women
Until the recent times, education for women was considered unnecessary and undesirable for female children in plantations, because the girl’s future was seen to be limited to plantation work as either tea plucker or rubber tapper.
Education is a key to change the women’s lifestyle. It is important to provide girls with the quality education and equal economic opportunities. Health and nutrition should also be considered as important factors which affect the education of plantation women.
The estate population of Sri Lanka are the descendants of Indian migrants brought down by the British Colonials in the 19th century. Now they have formed a minority community constituting (Estate Sector) about 4.4 percent of the country’s population.
The estate population working contributes to the economy of the country by earning nearly 24% of the foreign revenue and, sharing nearly 10% of the total labour force and 4.0% the GDP of the country. They are also identified as Indian origin Tamils and Malaiyaga Tamils. They are defined as labour community living in the plantations under a regimented system of labour management and they had been denied the right to mobility and labour rights.
The plantation management made responsible for their welfare, including health and education and for the supply of goods needed until nationalization of the British owned plantations in 1972. This system was gone through some changes with the nationalization of the plantations, and the subsequent privatization in 1992. The emergence of Trade Unions in 1940s and 1950s resulted in changing the system of plantation management and rights of the labour force.
Plantation sector
Women contribute more than 65% of the labour force of the plantation sector in the Sri Lanka. Although, the plantation women, have been continuously discriminated than from male counterpart and also subjected to various kinds of oppression when concerning their civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, and the right to development. This desk review and field research attempts to highlight the Status of Plantation Women on Land Rights, Higher Education and Employable Skills for Livelihood situation of plantation women. However, available policies addressing the plantation women, challenges and action needed for women’s participation in a sustainable economy growth.
Women have struggled for their right, livelihood, social status. Historically they have fought for equal treatment and social status all over the world. In the early part of this century, the right of the plantation women to receive an education, obtain paid employment and skills, enter professions, access to ownership of land was a highly contested issue in Sri Lanka. Thus, the employment options for plantation women were confined to labour within the tea production system. The education they received in estate schools and guidance from parents, elders, and management prepared them for no other work.
Women are considered to be the main drivers of both household and the plantation economy. They are mainly engaged in labour tasks such as plucking tea leaves and tapping rubber. Some women in the estate sector working in the garment factories and migrated overseas mainly as domestic workers. However, women tend to be supplementary earners and dependent wives. They are affected by socio-cultural factors especially by the traditional restrictions of patriarchal gender relations, social norms, lack of health and nutrition, poverty, sexual harassment, poor education, severely limited employment prospect, restriction in land rights.
What do existing laws and policies say?
Provisions concerning women access to economic rights and natural resources are embodied in the international human rights law and in international human rights instruments which are highly recognised at international and national levels. According to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 and International conventions on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and International Convention on Social Economic and Cultural Rights (ICSECR) of 1966 women have all the rights as their male counterpart enjoy without any discrimination. Article 2 and 17 of Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), Article 15 of Convention on Elimination of all forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), Article 14 (2.g) of CEDAW equality in agrarian reform, Article 16 of CEDAW are ensures equal rights of women in the ownership, acquisition, management of property within the family. This review proposes to explore and analyse the status of the existing policies and policy gaps in the Sri Lanka on the aspects of land rights, access to higher education and skill development for livelihood for plantation women in Sri Lanka.
It is necessary to reinforce the rights-based approach for creating an environment in which women can enjoy their legal rights and equality by freedom from violence and discrimination on economic and social status.
It is an important task and a responsibility for the state’s policymakers to eradicate all forms of discrimination against women and empower them in all aspects that make them an equal citizen of the country. Developing and empowering of women belong to vulnerable and marginalized groups and improving their family living standards will lead to overall economic prosperity of the country and social harmony in the world.

a. Creating an environment where the plantation women can successfully face the challenges in relation to land rights and, access to higher education and employable skills, and to integrate them into the decision making process.
b. Establishing a society in which women attain their full potential and are able to participate as equal partners in all spheres of life and influence in the process of social change.
c. Eliminating of all forms of violence against women through the strengthening of policies and legislation programmes.
d. Empowering women in economic, social and political aspects at grass root level through training on leadership and decision-making process.
