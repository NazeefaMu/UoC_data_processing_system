JICA volunteer supports Dehiwala Zoo activities

Sayo Yamao has been working for the National Zoological Gardens (NZG) in Dehiwala for the past seven months. She is one of 71 JICA volunteers currently working in the country in response to requests made by the Government of Sri Lanka. Her assignment at the NZG entails working on animal breeding, enrichment, animal training and healthcare.
Animals in the zoo miss living in their natural habitat and therefore, as a part of their work, zookeepers try to conduct different types of enrichment activities such as habitat, feeding and sensory enrichment programmes to uplift their natural behaviors. It is this activity that Yamao is currently supporting by using her expertise. For example, she has introduced puzzle-feeding activities for chimpanzees, orangutans and tigers, where food is not directly fed to animals, but it is creatively concealed so that animals have to make an effort to find their food. The purpose of this exercise is to reduce the monotony that comes as a result of direct feeding and stimulate the mental and physical activity of animals, whilst trying to reduce the time and motivation for misbehavior. Yamao has also introduced new menus for the animals and is currently training sea lions to perform new tricks at the daily Sea Lion Show.
Yamao conducts activities in collaboration with local zoo keepers who have been motivated by her support, sharing of knowledge and expertise. Whilst mentioning that the local zookeepers are knowledgeable and experienced, she stated that the health of animals could be further enhanced if there is increased interaction between staff at zoo hospital and zookeepers (which would, for example, reduce instances of overfeeding of the animals). She also mentioned that improvement could be brought about by revising the feeding times, wherever appropriate and paying more attention to cleanliness. Yamao is a licensed veterinary nurse who has worked for seven years in a Japanese safari park with both captive and non-captive animals.
