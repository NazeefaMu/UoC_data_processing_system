SLC to make Rs. 1 billion net profit from Hero Nidahas Trophy

Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) yesterday announced the successful tie up with several internationally reputed partners, thus making the Hero Nidahas Trophy 2018, a T20 Tri-Series, a tremendous commercial success estimating a net profit of Rs. 1 billion.
This is the first time since 2004, SLC solely went into the international market and secured partners to grant media and broadcasting rights of the Hero Nidahas Trophy 2018, directly to the respective territories (India and Bangladesh).
SLC also successfully secured partners for granting of ground sponsorship, advertisement and residual media rights of the tournament, which will kick start on 6 March featuring Sri Lanka, India and Bangladesh.
Accordingly, DSports, a unit of Lex Sportel Vision Private Limited and Channel 9 of the ABL Group Private Limited was granted the Broadcasting and Media Rights for the Territory of India and Bangladesh, respectively. ITW Consulting Private Limited was awarded the ground sponsorship, advertisement and residual media rights of the upcoming tri-series.
“We are happy to announce this event will bring in the highest viewership, listenership and the digital penetration for an event of SLC’s own, thus further enhancing our brand in the global sporting stage,” said Thilanga Sumathipala, president, Sri Lanka Cricket, speaking during the media briefing held at JAIC Hilton hotel yesterday.
In the meantime, Indian Automobile Manufacture, Hero Moto Corp. Ltd came forward as the title sponsor of the tournament. Hence, the tri-series will be known as ‘Hero Nidahas Trophy 2018’.
“With all these internationally recognized partners coming in, this is going to be the most commercially successful tri-nation tournament organized by SLC. We expect to earn at least Rs. 1 billion in net profit out of this series,” Sumathipala added.
In a bid to make this effort a success, SLC in mid-2017 appointed Lagardere Sports Asia, an international sports marketing agency as their international marketing consultant for the upcoming T20I Tri-Series.
The upcoming Tri-Series will see 3 countries playing seven (7) T20Is. The tournament will be played at the R. Premadasa International Cricket Stadium.
The curtain raiser of the tournament will be on 6 March and the final will be played on Sunday, 18 March.
