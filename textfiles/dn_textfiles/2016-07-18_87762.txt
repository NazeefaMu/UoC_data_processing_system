Young Lions perform creditably against South African counterparts

Sri Lanka U19 Youth team under the captaincy of Avishka Fernando, a product of St.Sebastian’s, Moratuwa with a great future, finished their home series against visiting South Africa U19 with a slight edge over their opponents as they were able to force a win-less draw in the three-match Youth Test series whilst winning the following one-day series 2-1. Sri Lanka U19 after their triumph in the one-day series were awarded with the Gamini Dissanayake Challenge Trophy that was on offer for the champions of this series.
3-MATCH YOUTH TEST SERIES
As South African contingent was packed with a strong batting and a fast-bowling lineup; and they were a nation generally renowned for their Excellency on the field, Avishka and his team had a tough task especially ahead of the three-match Youth Test series. However, Lankans’ stubborn approach in the Test series denied South Africans of any chance whatsoever to dominate as many expected at the outset. Lankans played so well that they did not allow the visitors to come closer to a victory either in any of the three Test matches.
Individual outcomes of the Test series with four South African players, J van Heerden - 344 runs, R Vasconcelos - 256, PWA Mulder - 220, R van Tonder - 191 occupying the first five positions of the batting list proved that their batting was superior to the Sri Lankans. The only Sri Lankan batsman who could capture a place in the first five was Pathum Nissanka with 195 runs to his credit. However, Sri Lankans claimed the honour of scoring more centuries as Pathum NIssanka and Ashen Bandara scored two of the three centuries recorded in the series. In the bowling, Praveen Jayawickrama with 8 wickets topped Lankans bowling list and was second overall behind leader PWA Mulder of South Africa who bagged 12 wickets. Prashan Kumara (7 wickets) and Damitha Silva (6) also bowled well for Sri Lanka occupying the 4th and 5th spots of the overall bowling list.

3-MATCH ONE-DAY SERIES
Sri Lanka U19 and visiting South Africa U19, after both teams gained equal honours in the preceding Youth Test Series all three matches of which produced no results, used the following three-match one-day series to gain the supremacy over each other as the shorter format was always results-oriented.
South Africa U19 set the tone for their early dominance in the series when they sneaked to a narrow 16-run win in the series opener with the help of their bowlers who well defending their meagre total bowled out the home team with 16 runs short of the target of 186 to take 1-0 lead in the three-match series. South Africa needing just a win to secure the series came into the second match with their tails up, but Sri Lanka came-back very strongly to win rain-affected second match by 12 runs on D/L method and level the series.
Sri Lanka skipper, Avishka Fernando’s 115-ball 97 with 11 fours and two sixes helped the home team stay ahead of D/L target when play ended in the 48th over. As the two teams had one win each after the first two encounters, the third and final match became the decider. South African’s score of 195 after they elected to bat on winning the toss in the final match was made easily accessible by Sammu Ashan and Ashen Bandara who in a dramatic 100-run partnership unfinished for the fifth wicket claimed an eight-wicket win in the decisive third one-dayer, thereby sealing series 2-1.
Skippers of two sides, Avishka Fernando of Sri Lanka and Wiaan Mulder of South Africa topped the series batting list with Avishka collecting 130 runs at 43 and Mulder 107 at 36. Ashen Bandara and Sammu Ashan of Sri Lanka with 83 and 75 runs to their credit occupied the third and fourth places of the batting list whilst South African, R van Tonder came fifth with 74 runs. In the bowling, Damitha Silva had a tally of 9 wickets to lead the table whilst WD Sendin of South Africa capturing 7 wickets and Praveen Jayawickrama of Sri Lanka with 6 wickets occupied the next two spots.

A BRIEF DESCRIPION OF THE FINAL ONE-DAYER
South Africa U19 in this decisive third and final one-dayer with both teams having a win each from the first two contests decided to bat first on a good batting track at the SSC, but their slower approach at the outset did not help their cause in this crucial game.
South Africans needed more than 30 overs to put their 100 on the board though they had enough wickets in hand to do the acceleration. Despite No.2 batsman, Wandile Makwedu scored his 26 at a reasonable pace, Raynard van Tonder and skipper Wiaan Mulder used 172 balls to contribute just 96 runs between the two at less than four runs per over though the pair rebuilt their innings with a useful 70-run stand for the fourth wicket.
However, Eathan Bosch’s 26-ball 20 and Kennan Smith’s 15-ball 20 in a late cameo carried South African’s final total closer to two hundred before they finally reached 195 for nine in their allotted 50 overs, a total looked to be reasonable compared to the sedate way they started their innings though it was not a challenging total in the conditions. Damitha Silva and Sammu Ashan shared a good seven wickets between them whilst Ayana Siriwarshana and Praveen Jayawickrama bowled their 10-over spells quite economically keeping South African batsmen at bay.
Lankans got off to a reasonable start, though they lost opener Pathum Nissanka cheaply, with the help of Shanogeeth’s anchor innings. Avishka Fernando and Mishen Silva both got a start but could not hang on. However, after Shanogeeth departed for a well accomplished 41, Sammu Ashan and Ashen Bandara easily combating the tricky conditions with smart batting deprived South Africans of making a comeback in order to defend their meagre total. The pair put on a century-stand for the unfinished fifth wicket to secure Lankans victory by 6 wickets with 25 balls remaining. Sammu Ashan getting back to his usual rhythm at the right time remained 70 not out from 103 balls with 4 fours and a six whilst Ashen Bandara finished with an unbeaten 37.
South Africa U19: 195-9 in 50 overs (Wiaan Mulder 59, Raynard van Tonder 37, Damitha Silva 4/48, Shammu Ashan 3/38)
Sri Lanka U19: 199-4 in 45.5 overs (Shammu Ashan 70*, S Shanogeeth 41, Ashen Bandara 37*, WD Sendin 2/33, PWA Mulder 2/32)
