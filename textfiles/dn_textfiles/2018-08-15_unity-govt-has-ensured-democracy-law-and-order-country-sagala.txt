Unity Govt. has ensured democracy, law and order in country: Sagala

There is no better place in the region than Sri Lanka, where people could come and do business and where tourists could visit, said Youth Affairs, Project Management and Southern Development Minister Sagala Rathnayaka.
He was participating as Chief Guest at a ceremony distributing certificates to youths who had completed training programmes at the Institute of Business Process Outsourcing and La Hotelier National Youth Corps Hotel School, held yesterday at the Rock House Army Camp.
He said that the Unity Government jointly formed by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe had succeeded in ensuring democracy and law and order of the country.
“This period has been more challenging than in any other period that the world had moved through. Technology has taken away boarders and boundaries. We are in an era of global village. Youths of Sri Lanka has had no choice but to become part of this global village. It’s a challenge. But the youths have to be equipped by themselves with what is required to meet this challenge,” the Minister said.
He further said that Prime Minister Wickremesinghe had designed the National Youth Corps in order to help Sri Lanka’s youth to meet the future challenges.
“As a young minister, the Prime Minister wanted me to provide leadership to these youth corps. We wished to build up a disciplined youth who would be equipped with the skills that are required to meet the demands in the employment sector,” he added.
With the establishment of more and more industrial zones and the boom of tourism, there would be plenty of employment opportunities for Sri Lankan youths, while there would be plenty of peripheral services where young entrepreneurs would have to come forward and fill those opportunities.
State Minister of Youth Affairs Piyasena Gamage, Ministry Secretary Gamini Seneviratne, State Secretary Chulananda Perera, Additional Secretary K.A.S. Keeragala, NYC Council Chairman Major General H.C.P.Goonetilleke, NYC Director Brigadier N.I.de Silva and many other distinguished officials participated at the occasion.
