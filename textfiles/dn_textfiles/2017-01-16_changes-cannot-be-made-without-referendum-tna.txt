Changes cannot be made without referendum: TNA

The TNA yesterday reiterated its position that it would not settle for any Constitutional Amendment that does not require a referendum, but for a new Constitution which ushers in fundamental changes including the abolition of executive Presidency.
TNA Spokesman MP M.A. Sumanthiran, reminding that the mandate President Maithripala Sirisena received from the people was to make significant changes to the Constitution, pointed out those changes could not be made without a referendum.
Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, he said the President and the Prime Minister should act according to the mandate people have given not withstanding opposition from the forces that lost out and were rejected by the people.
“These lost out forces cannot speak to change the mandate that the people gave to the President just because they are in the Cabinet now. They were people who supported former President Mahinda Rajapaksa at the previous presidential polls and opposed Common Candidate Sirisena. They must change and not try to change the President against the people’s will,” he said.
He said fundamental changes like the abolition of the Executive Presidency was the first promise of Common Candidate Sirisena, adding that these could not be accomplished by tinkering the existing Constitution. “Those who articulate the position that no referendum should be held are also saying that it will be lost. Pushing ahead changes without a referendum knowing that people would not approve them would be to fool the people. We do not want anything done behind the back of our people. We want the people to approve any significant change that the Constitution goes through,” he said.
