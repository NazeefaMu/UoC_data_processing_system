The guys can’t be more ready than this - Donald

Sri Lanka’s fast bowling consultant South African Allan Donald said that it is upto the team and its players to do the country proud after they had gone through one of the most thorough preparations ahead of the ICC Champions trophy.
“The attitude and intensity the boys brought to the table over the last 10-15 days it’s been unbelievable, we couldn’t have asked for anymore than that,” said Donald who prepared the players in their training in Colombo and Kandy.
“Coming to Kandy was a very smart idea. We had a lot of time to train and train specifically and to give the guys realistic intensity and pressure out there in the middle. The guys can’t be more ready than this,” said Donald.
“All credit to the back room staff for helping wherever they could and also the facilities that has been given to us. It is upto us to get into match situations and go through a few games to get us mentally prepared. It’s been a fantastic exercise and its over to us now to do Sri Lanka proud,” he said.
