Call for disciplinary action against Jayaratne, Aluthgamage

The Government members called on Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to take disciplinary action against Joint Opposition MPs Priyankara Jayaratne and Mahindananda Aluthgamage for ridiculing Parliament following its adjournment.
Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera came up with this request during a hurried convened press conference at the Parliamentary complex to explain the Government’s position on the confusion reigned in Parliament yesterday morning.
Back to back press conferences were held called in Parliament yesterday by the Joint Opposition, JVP, Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala and the Government. The press conference called by the Government was attended by Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella, Chief Government Whip and Minister Gayantha Karunathilake and Deputy Minister Ajith P Perera.
“MP Priyankara Jayaratne sat on the Speaker’s chair and unofficially presided a session after the House was adjourned. The JO agitated in the House at a previous time demanding to take action against a Parliament employee who reportedly sat on the Speaker’s chair. MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage sat on the seat allocated for the Parliament Secretary General and rang the Quorum bell summoning the members in. The Speaker should take disciplinary action against the JO MPs who purposefully ridiculed Parliament. Insulting Parliament means insulting the people,” the Deputy Minister said.
He said the Government members would make a formal complaint to the Speaker in this regard requesting an inquiry.
Speaking to the media Minister Gayantha Karunathilake said the JO ran away from the debate facilitated by the Government on the Hambantota port draft concession agreement. “We facilitated the debate as per the President’s direction to get the views and constructive criticism of the Opposition to the draft agreement. We were well prepared for the debate. The JO deliberately disrupted it knowing that their shady deals behind the construction of Hambantota port would come out during the course of it,” he said.
Responding to a question by a journalist Minister Kiriella said the resolution with regard to the Gazette extraordinary issued by the President declaring supply and distribution of fuel as essential services was duly passed in Parliament. “Having the Mace inside Parliament is enough to pass legislation. It needs not necessarily be at the bracket. We did nothing contrary to Standing Orders. The Deputy Sergeant-at-arms held it because the JO MPs tried to grab it and run,” the minister explained.
