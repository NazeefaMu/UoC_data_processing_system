Miners protest closing of Ragedera mine

Miners of the Ragedera mine in Melsiripura have launched a sathyagrahaya, 183 feet underground, demanding the authorities to revoke a decision to close the mine.
The protesting miners said that the management of the mine had decided to close it from January 1. They demanded the management to continue the mine, as it was a profit-making venture.
Around 40 workers are currently engaged in the project. The mine was started during the rule of the British, and the workers say that generations of their families had worked there.
Workers added that State authorities should intervene to stop the closure of the mine and ensure their job security.
