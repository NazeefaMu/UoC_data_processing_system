Jos Buttler’s boys showed depth of the talent pool

That was a special achievement by England. A huge, monumental effort in front of a partisan home crowd with no English fans in at all.
Some people will say ‘it’s only Bangladesh let’s not get too giddy,’ but let’s just think about what happened here.
First of all England were without their regular top four batsmen and then you have to consider the surroundings and all the security that has made this a very unusual and demanding trip.
Finally, just have a look at Bangladesh’s record here. They’ve won six one-day series in a row at home and you can see from their experienced side that they know what they are doing.
This 2-1 series win says a lot for the strength of English cricket at the moment. They really do have some seriously good cricketers.
It came home to me when England were four wickets down chasing a tough target and I just looked up and saw Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler at the crease. With so much batting still to come, I thought ‘crikey, we’re safe here.’
A few years ago conditions here in Bangladesh would have been totally alien to English cricketers but now they are sent all round the world to prepare for occasions like this on Under 19, Lions and even club cricket tours.
So that means you get lads like Ben Duckett who comes in and makes two 50s in his first three matches and Sam Billings gets runs as if he has always opened for England.
He doesn’t even open for Kent normally. But you still keep your fingers firmly crossed when they first play and to see Duckett and Billings play the way they did on Wednesday night, so cool, so calm augers very well for challenges ahead.
Billings is a talent. England have known for some time that there was something with this lad that meant they had to get him in the side somehow. But it has taken the absence of four batsmen to do it.
Duckett, meanwhile, reminds me of a young Eoin Morgan, the way he hits both sides of the wicket, with fast hands and plays 360 degrees.
He handled the pressure well too. It’s one thing doing it for Northants, but it’s completely different doing it for England in conditions like this.
A tour like this really does bring people together. England would have bonded here. Even the other night when there was a bit of trouble you could see how closely knit they are. They will remember this trip.
Which, of course, brings me to Morgan. I believe he should come back as England captain for the one-day series against India in January.
I said that on the day it became clear that he was not coming here.
He has been the driving force behind England’s one-day revolution, he has turned their white-ball cricket around and he has an awful lot of credit in the bank. There’s no question that he comes straight back in.
But there is nothing that will ever convince me that he was right to miss this tour. And, from what I’ve seen since I’ve been here, I’m even more convinced he should have come. Captaincy and the game haven’t changed that much.
What this trip has done, though, is show England that they have a very capable deputy in Buttler and if Morgan doesn’t score many runs in India they have plenty of batsmen in reserve who could come in.
It won’t be easy for Eoin to tell the likes of Billings, Duckett and Jonny Bairstow that they might not be in the side next time because he and Alex Hales are coming back. But this trip has been about good things. It has been a worthwhile exercise — and the Tests are still to come.
