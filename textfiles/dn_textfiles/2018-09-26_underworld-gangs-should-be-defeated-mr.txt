Underworld gangs should be defeated - MR

Former President and MP Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday said that underworld gangs are freely operating in all parts of the country.
Speaking at an event in Embilipitiya, Rajapaksa added that Police sought permission to bring the Ava group in the North to book. “If an organisation involves in anti social activities in the South, the police does not have to wait till permission is granted,” Rajapaksa said. He said a murder takes place every day in the country and the government is not interested in arresting this situation.
“The people in the country are stranded due to this situation,” he said.
The former President added that parents should protect their children as the drug menance has gained a foothold into the villages too.
