New CEO for Interbrand

Interbrand, the world’s largest and most influential brand consultancy, has announced Charles Trevail as its new global Chief Executive Officer, effective 1 January 2018.
Having built up two very high-profile consultancies that were subsequently acquired by Omnicom, Travail is passionate about the reinvention of brands and will drive growth for Interbrand’s clients through brand building, customer insight and experience. Trevail has advised companies and governments worldwide, including British Airways, BMW, McDonald’s, Telefonica, and L’Oreal.
“It’s a great honour to lead Interbrand. It is a high-profile business with incredible people and clients. It is also a brand that is one of the most admired and influential in the marketing community. The world of brands and customer experience is the growth engine for the future. I look forward to getting started and working with the team to deliver for clients,” Trevail said.
Trevail succeeds Jez Frampton, who retired in December 2017 after 22 years with the consultancy.
During his time as global CEO, Frampton oversaw the strategy and growth for Interbrand’s 31 offices globally. He completed an overhaul of the business and its market offer to reflect the company’s global clients’ needs. He also pushed for digital transformation within Interbrand, moving from less than 10% digital to over 50% in three years.
Frampton added: “Charles Trevail is the perfect person to take Interbrand to the next level. He is a passionate and proven leader who knows how to build relationships – with clients, with agency partners, and with talent – that build brands.”
Interbrand now has 31 offices in 17 countries.
In 2015 the consultancy partnered Sri Lankan brand consultancy MND led by Michel Nugawela to drive growth within the market.
