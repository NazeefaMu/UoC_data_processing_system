UNF received people's mandate not UPFA or SLFP: Kiriella

 
It was the United National Front and not the UPFA or the SLFP which received the people's mandate at the last general election. This should be borne in mind by constituent parties of the government as well as the so called Common Opposition, Higher Education and Highways Minister and Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella said.
He said UNP captured 107 seats at the last election but some people were talking as if the people's mandate was received by the UPFA or the SLFP.
Kiriella made these observations addressing the media after he called on the newly elected Asgiriya prelate Most Ven. Warakagoda Gnanaratana Mahanayake Thera at the Asgiriya Viharaya in Kandy and received his blessings on Sunday.
The minister said President Maithripala Sirisena also won the presidency contesting under the banner of the United National Front.
Kiriella said that even though the delimitation of electoral wards was decided on at the residencies of former parliamentarians during the previous regime, the delimitation of electoral boundaries was being done in a transparent and proper manner today.
"The local elections would be called once the delimitation process was conducted in a fair and just manner," the minister said.
He also said the old Bogambara Prison would be transformed into a super grade hotel today.
