No entrance fee for children at parks, says CMC

The Colombo Municipal Council Engineering Department yesterday dismissed as false a recent news report that children entering the Colombo Viharamahadevi Park and the Crow Island beach park are to be charged Rs. 400 each.
A press release issued by the Council’s Director Engineering R.M.D. Jayawardene said that entrance into these two parks will be free as previously. A proposal made by the Standing Committee on Finance for a remote control toy car project as a six-month pilot project by a private firm has been approved by the Council. This will be open for children in the 5-10 year age group.
The firm had proposed a fee of Rs. 100 per 15 minutes of its use. But her department has proposed to the Standing Committee to reduce this charge to Rs. 50.
Moreover, the private sector has been operating three fee-levying projects in the Viharamahadevi Park for a long time. They are on the following basis: bicycle rental – Rs. 100 per hour, pedal boat service – children Rs. 50 per half hour and adults Rs. 100 per hour, 10 rides on baby train - Rs. 50, viewing Min Medura – Rs. 20, pony cart – Rs. 50 per round and pony ride – Rs. 100 per ride.
