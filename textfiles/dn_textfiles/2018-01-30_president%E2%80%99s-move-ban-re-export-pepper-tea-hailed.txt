President’s move to ban re-export of pepper, tea hailed

The Spices and Allied Products Producers’ and Traders’ Association yesterday expressed satisfaction over the decision taken by the government to ban the re-export of pepper from Sri Lanka with effect from February 10, 2018.
The Spices and Allied Products Producers’ and Traders’ Association organization said it was happy to learn from the media that President Maitripala Sirisena has directed that the re-export of pepper from Sri Lanka would be banned from February 10 2018.”This step is in the right direction to protect Sri Lanka pepper.”
In addition to pepper, President Sirisena also stated that the re-export of tea will also be stopped immediately. The President expressed these views at a public rally held in Badulla recently.
According to President Sirisena, the import and re-export of pepper amid low global prices has hurt the industry growth prospects to a great extent and has led to a collapse of the industry.
The President further noted that the import and re-export of tea has also negatively impacted the image of Ceylon Tea. The 50-percent concession given to farmers on seed potatoes would also be increased to 100 percent, the President noted. (IH)
