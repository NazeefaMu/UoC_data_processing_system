Tune up for Guitar Fest

The seventh guitar music festival ‘Guitar Fest 2017’ will be staged on January 20 to 26. Concerts will be held in Sri Jayawardenapura University, University of Peradeniya, Swami Vipulanada Aesthetic Institute, Eastern University, Russian Centre Colombo, Badulla Town Hall and Kalaithoothu Kalamandram Jaffna.
"The festival is special because we are performing in Badulla and at Eastern University. We are having a concert at Dharmaraja College, Kandy for schoolchildren. Guitarists from Japan and India will be performing with local guitarists. A team of young guitarists from Jaffna will also perform," GASL Secretary Mohomed Iqbal said.
"The guitar festival is a service to our people. It has developed awareness of music among the youth. We hope more young people will take an interest in music and join us," GASL President Rohan Silva said.
“Music is a powerful medium that can be used to change the minds. Guitar Fest can help develop a cultured society. The vision of the department goes parallel to the objective of the Guitar Association of Sri Lanka. We are jointly holding this," Cultural Affairs Department Director Anusha Gokula Fernando.
All concerts are free of charge.
