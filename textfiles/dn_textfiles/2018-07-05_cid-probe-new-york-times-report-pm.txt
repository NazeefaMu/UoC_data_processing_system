CHINESE FIRM FUNDING MR CAMPAIGN IN 2015:
CID to probe into New York Times report - PM

The Criminal Investigations Department will conduct an investigation on the recent allegations made by the New York Times’ report, based on Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake’s complaint.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday told Parliament that Deputy Minister Ramanayake initially lodged the complaint at the police and the case was later transferred to the CID.
“If someone is speaking of democracy, stop threatening the journalists first, PM Wickremesinghe urged.
He pointed out that New York Times’ International Editor in a statement has observed that the two local journalists who have assisted them in the investigation report were threatened.
The Premier said such threatening has tarnished the image of the country.
“These people do this out of habit. When these fellows were in power, Lasantha Wickrematunge was killed. Ekneligoda was killed. Keith Noyahr and Upali Thennakoon were attacked.
This habit is so much, they threaten New York Times while they are in the Opposition,” the PM in reply to a question raised by UNP MP Marikkar pointed out.
The Prime Minister also requested the JO to withdraw the threat made by them at a recent press conference against the media personnel.
