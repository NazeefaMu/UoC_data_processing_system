CCD to identify spoilers

The Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) yesterday informed the Colombo Chief Magistrate that they have initiated an investigation into the incident where a group of police officers were obstructed by several individuals during the arrest attempt on Medical Faculty Students’ Action Committee Convener Ryan Jayalath on July 20.
Following a request by the CCD, Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara issued an order directing six television channels that videos footage pertaining to alleged police obstruction be handed over to police to carry out investigations.
The CCD is investigating to arrest Ryan Jayalath for forcibly entering the Health Ministry premises and damaging its property amounting to Rs.870,000.
A tense situation arose on July 20 when the CCD attempted to arrest Ryan Jayalath following an anti-SAITM discussion at the GMOA office at the Organisation of Professional Associations (OPA) building in Colombo.
As the crowd at the OPA premises protested, Police had left without taking Jayalath into custody.
The CCD informed Court that police officers had arrived in a white van belonging to the Police Department and acted in accordance with the law.
