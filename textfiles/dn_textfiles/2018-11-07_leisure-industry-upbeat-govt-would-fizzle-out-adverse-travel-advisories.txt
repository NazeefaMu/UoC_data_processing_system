Leisure industry upbeat that Govt would  fizzle out adverse travel advisories

Sri Lankan leisure industry is upbeat that the new government would be able to fizzle out adverse travel advisories that were imposed against Sri Lanka by foreign missions in the wake of President Maithripala Sirisena appointing Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister.
The world’s second largest travel show WTM, is currently in progress in London and new Tourism Minister Wasantha Senanayake attended the opening ceremony on Monday. He also addressed the foreign media and Sri Lankan participants at the event. The new Sri Lankan Tourism Brand identity, So Sri Lanka too was launched at this event. The New Minister also told the foreign media that there was no violence as projected by some of the travel advisories and explained about the current political situation to them.
Veteran British politician and former Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons, Lord Naseby who attended the opening ceremony of the Sri Lanka stand said that there truly is nothing quite like Sri Lanka. “I think Sri Lanka in its very composition – geographically compact, naturally diverse, culturally dynamic and contemporary in its outlook – is very clever and enticing for any type of British traveler.”
‘So Sri Lanka’ is intriguing and impactful, and for a country competing with the best destinations across the globe – this interpretation of the magic of the island I’ve visited countless times and loved more with each experience – is fresh, memorable and universal in its sentiment.”
“The launch of ‘So Sri Lanka’ at the World Travel Market (WTM) in London is a testament to the importance of the UK tourism market to our island. As the third-largest contributor to Sri Lanka’s tourism industry, with significant year-on-year growth, I am particularly pleased that the beginning of this momentous journey starts here, said Manisha Gunesekera, High Commissioner for Sri Lanka in the United Kingdom.
“ It is also important mentioning that this is the first time in history that Sri Lanka tourism has worked towards building a strategic digital-first perspective, ‘So Sri Lanka’ is an amplifier brand that supports and engages typical millennial travel exploration, this is important in view of the statistic that in 2020, 50% of travel revenue will be spent by millennials, and Asia is a millennial favorite – so we are committed to making Sri Lanka future-savvy and a vibrantly relevant destination going forward,” Minister Senanayake said.
