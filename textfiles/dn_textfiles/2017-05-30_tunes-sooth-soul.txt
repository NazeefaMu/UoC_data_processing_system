Tunes to sooth the soul

Soundarie David Rodrigo, the multi-talented musician has finally decided to unveil her music soul to us by presenting ‘Soul’ – An evening of original music. The award winning director and her choir will perform the kind of music which inspired, shaped and guided them.
She wrote her first original Journey in 2015 and it was performed by her internationally acclaimed female ensemble Soul sounds. Now she is all set to stage her next. Soul will be held on June 7 at Lionel Wendt Theatre. Fairway holding, Chamber of commerce and the Fairway Galle literary Festival have once again come forward to support Soundarie‘s milestone in her musical journey .
Soundarie promises it be an evening full of surprises.
“You might hear Baroque –inspired or smacking of jazz or something with a touch of gospel, you never know. Keep guessing!” Soundarie said.
Soundarie understands that music is form of expression and an evolving art but makes sure the authenticity of the music is not lost in the path of changing.
“ Presenting original work is incredibly challenging , satisfying , rewarding and at the same time terrifying , but one has to push their limits and step out of their comfort zone to evolve as an artist”, she added .
Soundarie runs her own music academy - The Soul Sounds Academy , it focus on all aspects of music. She also directs the Island’s premiere all-female choir “ Soul Sounds “ , the choir has sung in many prestigious platforms and has bagged many awards.
