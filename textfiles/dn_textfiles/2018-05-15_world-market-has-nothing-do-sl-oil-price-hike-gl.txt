World Market has nothing to do with SL oil price hike: GL

Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) leader Prof. G. L. Peiris yesterday said the Government is consistently maintaining that the rise in fuel prices is due to the fluctuation in world market prices, but the government’s weaknesses and deficiencies cause the increase.
He was addressing a press conference organised by the Joint Opposition at the SLPP office at Battaramulla yesterday.
Prof. Peiris, referring to the arrest of Dr, Mahanama and P. Dissanayake, said that corruption and frauds were rampant. “The two officials were not even patience enough to go home and count the money given to them by an Indian company as a bribe,” he said
This government commits corruption unlimited, he said
Maintaining the government and its ministers is costly now. The public has to spend Rs. 560 million monthly to maintain the Cabinet, he said.
The Government should look into officials’ credential before they are appointed to the higher positions, he said.
