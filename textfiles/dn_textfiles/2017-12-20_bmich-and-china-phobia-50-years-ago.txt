Dudley Senanayake government refused to surrender the national pride to a pot of rice
BMICH AND CHINA PHOBIA 50 YEARS AGO

During Sirimavo Bandaranaike’s 1960-64 rule, the Chinese Communist leaders decided to donate an International Conference Hall to commemorate its close ties with SWRD Bandaranaike who initiated diplomatic relations with Communist nation in 1957. However, the PM could not finalise the matter with Chinese when her government collapsed unexpectedly in 1964. The UNP led coalition entered the fray in March 1965 general elections. One of the main themes on propaganda was an impending threat caused by a Chinese ‘invasion’. The Chinese men that visited the island for their preliminary work in the construction of BMICH, toured many parts of the island on sight-seeing. As there were no Chinese tourists then, this became an unusual sight causing anxiety further instigated by the opposition.
A general consensus was built up among the villages that the Chinese were on a covertly move in preparation for take-over of the nation with the help of SLFPers. The UNP was back in power. They stopped the work-in-progress on BMICH by China causing a dilution of relations between the two nations.
Red-Guard Mao badges
‘Red Guards’ was a movement of radical Chinese youth who wore Mao badges and stimulated trouble both in China and in countries such as Burma. On August 10, 1965, a consignment of red-guard badges with Mao’s image and addressed to the Chinese embassy was held by customs when an alert officer suspected the parcel to contain something special. They informed the Foreign Affairs Ministry, who initiated an investigation.
The Communist party of Sri Lanka was in the throes of its own ideological differences based on the rift between Russia and China while Sri Lanka remained strictly neutral. They developed and enjoyed a special relationship with People’s Republic of China, under Sirimavo Bandaranaike in the early 1960s, but this did not persuade her into support of China during the Indo-China war in 1962.
A group of young ‘Peking Reds’ (Communist Party’s break-away China-wing supporters) led by N. Shanmugadasan visited Jaffna on August 12, 1965. S. D. Bandaranayake MP, the former SLFPer-turned China sympathiser travelled to the North too: they were on a mission to quell caste riots that erupted at a Hindu temple. Jaffna Police was asked to be on alert as the intelligence had reservations on the timing of the move.
The government in the meantime ordered that only Ministry of Defence could make decisions on visas for Chinese arriving or already domiciled here having come before 1948.
PM Chou warned us: “Do not rifle with 700 million Chinese"
The Chinese Mission in Colombo on August 14, issued a strongly worded vituperative note to the government. It accused them of “working in connivance with anti-Chinese elements and committing acts of robbery and sabotage of export goods and diplomatic articles of the embassy on board the time-chartered ship, the Aionnis”. It added that “The Ministry had gone to the extent of flagrantly holding up the badges with the profile of Chairman Mao and had not released them for more than a month. As number of vicious elements conducted a robbery; the Captain of the ship demanded protection from police of the port.” The note threatened the Sri Lankans, “Do not rifle with 700 million Chinese”.
The Chinese note spoke of …Ceylon’s “grave violation of international practice”. As our main supplier of rice here the Chinese held the whip-hand— the Dudley Senanayake government was not prepared to surrender the national pride to a pot of rice.
Earlier the Immigration Department handled these matters. The decision was based on intelligence reports that a massive built up of Communist Chinese in the country and that a large spy-ring was in operation. It was a deliberate faux pas by intelligence men close to government politicians. The Defence Ministry ordered an investigation of all stateless Chinese residing here working as dental technicians. Meanwhile, it was reported that Red Guards in Peking had assembled opposite Sri Lankan embassy demonstrated shouting anti-Lankan slogans and even pelted stones at the office, for Chinese soldiers to cordon off the area.
The Government realised that in the recent past Chinese have sent parallel threatening notes to countries like Burma, Indonesia, India, and Japan; therefore it decided to play it cool in keeping with the pattern of her new foreign policy. The Cabinet discussed the threats; one factor that weighed heavily in the minds of ministers was the various trade agreements that were in operation with China. Robert Gunawardene, the Ambassador to Peking was present at these meetings. The ministry announced that it was planning to issue a full statement on August 17, clarifying the position. Some literary books containing selected works of Mao were held back too.
Lakshman Kadirgamar on China
Unveiling the bust of the late PM Chou en Lai at the BMICH on April 9, 2005, Sri Lanka’s most talented Foreign Minister, Lakshman Kadirgamar said, “When a relationship is based on mutual respect and affection, the size, importance and power of one of the two countries in that relationship does not have a disproportionate influence on the other. China has never sought to influence the domestic politics of Sri Lanka. Over the years China has proved to be benign and sincere with no ulterior motives for befriending Sri Lanka. She has never tried to dominate, undermine or destabilize Sri Lanka.”
The minister continued, “She has come to our rescue with timely assistance on several occasions when there were threats to Sri Lanka’s national security and territorial integrity. There have been no strings attached to Chinese aid. When a relationship between two countries is not based on dependence, it is strengthened by the fact that it is based on the mutual recognition of equality. Sri Lanka in its own way has been helpful to China. The rubber-rice pact of 1951 has been referred to.”
The late Lakshman Kadirgamar said, “In more recent times, Sri Lanka has in a modest way been of assistance to China in international fora; especially in the field of human rights where Sri Lanka, taking the view that China was being unfairly treated in certain quarters, has been her steadfast ally. It is good for a relationship when both countries are able to contribute something towards sustaining and enhancing it. Sri Lanka has remained steadfast and unequivocal in respect of its One China Policy.”
BMICH, a work of art is a spectacular testimony to the closeness between the people of Sri Lanka and China. Speaking on May 18, 1973, at the opening of BMICH, Sirimavo said, “When I rather hesitantly expressed my desire to have an international conference hall, the Chinese Prime Minister Chou en Lai said, "Yes, I would be very glad to gift a hall in memory of my late friend. Only, I ask of you that you should name it after him".
