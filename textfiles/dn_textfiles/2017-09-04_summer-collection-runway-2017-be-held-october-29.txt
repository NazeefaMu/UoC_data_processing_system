Summer Collection  Runway 2017 to be held  on October 29

Summer Collection Runway 2017, organized by NICK JASON’S MODEL (Modelling and Dancing Academy), will be held on October 29 at the BMICH.
“This is a huge platform to showcase our local model talent and we encourage new models to work with us because of the great exposure NICK JASON’S MODEL gives to up-and-coming models as well as the grooming and improvement of personality that takes place. The Summer Collection Runway 2017 show gives models a vital opportunity to start their modelling careers, providing a platform for Sri Lankan models to showcase their talent both locally and in the international arena,” said Nick Jayamaha, Director and Modelling Advisor of NICK JASON’S MODEL.
“This year, we are planning to bring about 200 models for the fashion show, including our past and present students, all of whom will participate in this fashion show. We have invited delegations from embassies in Colombo and top businessmen in the country to attend the show,” he said.
“We want to give great opportunities for our models and business opportunities. Some of our senior models who started their career with our modelling and dancing academy now get business opportunities from ad agencies and acting opportunities from films and tele-dramas as well as opportunities from TV commercials. For this fashion show, we have organized photographers to cover the event and to highlight the talented, impressive and beautiful professionals and newcomers who participate. We want to give them publicity and they can get more publicity from this event. They can get more opportunities in different fields and they can also get the opportunity to make contacts at this event,” he said.
“Models can show their talents, they can show their creativeness from this event. This is an ideal platform for the models and others to get themselves highlighted and this is a very good opportunity for their career,” he said.
“From this fashion show, young beauties can groom themselves into world class actresses, supermodels or public characters, reaching international standards,” he said.
“This year, we have age categories starting from five years to fifteen years, fifteen years to thirty-five years and thirty-five years to sixty-five years. Both male and female models will be participating at this fashion show. We are going to have a special event and that would be 'Udarata Nilame' and 'Kumarihami'.
About 50 models will be participating at this special event. For the first time in Sri Lanka, we are going to install an 80-foot red carpet ramp,” he added.
