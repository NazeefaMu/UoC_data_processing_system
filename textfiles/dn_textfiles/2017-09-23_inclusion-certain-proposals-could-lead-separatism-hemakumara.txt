Inclusion of certain proposals could lead to separatism: Hemakumara

Constitutional Assembly Interim Report:
Mawbima Janatha Party Leader Hemakumara Nanayakkara warned yesterday that the inclusion of certain proposals to the Interim Report of the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly by several parties at the behest of Diaspora and Non-Governmental Organizations could once again lead to separatism.
Addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, he said that our party is in agreement with some of the proposals in the interim report. But, we cannot agree with several proposals which may lead to separatism again.
“This report apparently states that the Unitary State is not suitable for Sri Lanka eventhough it has remained so since ancient times. This is an attempt to replace unitary state with a united state. We oppose it. Sri Lanka is for all communities and all Provinces belong to all communities.We must give foremost place to Buddhism while guaranteeing equal rights to the other religions,”Nanayakkara said.
“The report describes Sri Lanka as unitary country with a central government and provincial units. Then how can this be a unitary country,” the Mawbima Janatha Party Leader asked.
“There is also an attempt to create Federal states without using the word ‘Federal’. Administrative powers should be decentralised in all Provinces. For example, there should be more translaters in areas dominated by the majority community.Any injustices to minority communities can be addressed only in a unitary country.The aim of these people depend on Diaspora and Non-Governmental organizations is to build a federal state by cutting the powers of Governors and giving more powers to Provincial councils,” he added.
Nanayakkara said Northern Province Governor C.V. Vigneswaran has urged the government to withdraw Army personnel from the North.
“But, he again says that the Army should be redeployed when there is an emergency,” Nanayakkara said.
“It is the Security Forces who protect the Northern people and not the Northern Chief Minister.The Chief Minister has his own security unit for his security,” he added.
