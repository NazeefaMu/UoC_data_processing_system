Why stepmotherly treatment for Jana Satana Paada Yatra, asks Dullas

The silence of the Police on the one year celebration of the National government held at the vicinity of three leading schools where the GCE (A/L) examination is held is highly questionable as it went before Court on eight occasions against the Jana Satana Paada Yatra since its commencement, UPFA Parliamentarian Dullas Alahapperuma said yesterday.
Alahapperuma said the procession to mark the celebration was to march opposite two schools while the GCE (A/L) examination was in progress.
He said Servatius College, St. Mary's College and President College in Matara are within a 200 m radius of the Sanath Jayasuriya Stadium in Matara where the celebrations was to be held.
Alahapperuma made these observations at a press conference at former President Mahinda Rajapaksa's Political Office in Battaramulla, Colombo, yesterday morning.
He said Rajapaksa instructed them to organise the Jana Satana Pada Yatra avoiding the day that the grade five scholarship examination was held.
The MP said 68 buses had been taken from the Matara bus depot causing severe difficulties to the students sitting the GCE (A/L) examination.
“During the last one year and seven months, two electoral organisers of Matara district have been removed without any reason which is a grave injustice,” Alahapperuma said.
“This is done on the agenda of the UNP and in protest of these decisions I resigned from my post of the district leadership, ” he said. "The ceremony is held in Matara and the venue was selected by the UNP. The main reason to hold it in Matara was the district that defeated the national government concept at the last election,” Alahapperuma said.
“We are taking the SLFP policies forward and if someone says we are not, we ask them to read S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike's speech in Parliament in 1951 after quitting the UNP and also establishing the SLFP,” the MP said.
Opposition MP Pavitra Wanniarachchi said even her parents were SLFPers and they love the party.
She said their objective was to set up a SLFP government and they would do it within two years.
Opposition MPs Prasanna Ranatunga and Rohitha Abeygunawardena also spoke.
