Access Engineering expedites Rajagiriya Flyover construction

Access Engineering is speeding up the construction work of the Rajagiriya flyover; to lessen traffic congestion at Rajagiriya junction along Sri Jayawardanapura Mawatha.
The construction work of the flyover project was initiated by the Road Development Authority under the Ministry of Higher Education and Highways during the last year due to the heavy traffic congestion which has long been a point of the contention among the daily commuters.
The project is funded by the Government of Spain and the design and the supply of the superstructure are entrusted to; Centunion S. A of Spain as the main contractor and the design and construction of substructure, on-site fabrication, the installation and erection of the steel superstructure are subcontracted to Access Engineering.
The flyover under construction is of 363m length and is to accommodate four traffic lanes built on two individual decks where width of a lane shall be 3.5m.
The flyover is to be built following the horizontal alignment of the existing Sri Jayawardenapura Mawatha with two horizontal curvatures of 257m and 128.5m in radius respectively and a vertical alignment with a minimum 5.2m vertical clearance for traffic flow underneath the flyover structure. Currently project has achieved 50% of physical progress, with a partial completion of the substructure.
The erection work of the structure has already been started along with the erection of steel tubular Y-shaped piers.
Additionally 20 nos of bored piles are installed and completed for the construction of retaining walls.
Once completed, the flyover will take the daily commuters amassed at 4+800 km near Victoria Home up and over the flyover to be connected to the Sri Jayawardenapura Mawatha at 5+570km close to Buthgamuwa Road Junction near Fuel Filling Station.
“We anticipate to see this project comes to fruition as this project will contribute for better transportation, for the economy as well as for the quality of life,” Rajagiriya Flyover Project Manager Jeewaka Dahanayake said.
