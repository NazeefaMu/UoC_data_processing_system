Thousand hectares of green gram cultivated in H’tota

One thousand hectares of green gram have been cultivated in the Hambantota district, under the Food Production National Programme of the Presidential Secretariat.
Seven hundred and fifty hectares have been cultivated in Lunugamwehera and 250 hectares have been cultivated in other areas of the district, according to the district agriculture director Hemantha Amarasingha.
Subsidy funds have been provided by the Agriculture Ministry for green gram cultivators in Ridiyagama and Badagiriya. Amarasingha said the target for this season with regard to green gram cultivation is already achieved. He added that steps are taken to set up electric fences in 30 locations in the district to prevent cattle destroying cultivations.
