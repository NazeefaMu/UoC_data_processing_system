Govt has undertaken water, power projects worth Rs 300 bn - Minister

Government has undertaken water and electricity related projects to the tune of Rs. 300 billion this year, said City Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauf Hakeem.
Speaking at the inauguration of Sri Lanka’s biggest, four-in-one International Expo on Water, Building, Power and Air Conditioning technology at the Sri Lanka Exhibition and Convention Centre yesterday, the Minister said that some projects like the Moragahakanda multipurpose irrigation project have already been completed. “For many protects foreign donor funding was received.”
The Minister said that the government also wants the private sector to play a major role in these projects when tenders are called for them. He said that they also want government companies to adopt the positive mindset of the private sector which would create a more active institution.
Minister Hakeem said that weather patterns have changed and these lead to droughts with the end result being power cuts.
“There is modern technology available to fight climate change issues and both the Ceylon Electricity Board and the Water Resources Board are working jointly with the United Nations Sustainable Development Fund in this regard.”
He said that several sectors in the local construction industry would benefit from product lines and machinery displayed by several countries at the exhibition.
Lanka Water ‘17, Lanka Build ‘17, Lanka Energy ‘17 and SIVAR ‘17 expo is hosted by Major Constructors of Sri Lanka (MCSL) with the support of the National Water Supply and Drainage Board, Ceylon Electricity Board, Water Resources Board, Institute of Town Planners and the Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau. AMB Tarsus Events Group Director Andrew Siow said, “More importantly, 80 percent of the exhibitors are from overseas and as such, most of the exhibits will be shown for the first time in Sri Lanka and as the majority of overseas exhibitors are manufacturers, visitors can source directly and seek solutions from the experts face-to-face.”
The organisers hope that the expo will also contribute to the economy by promoting business partnerships and investment opportunities between Sri Lankan businessmen and the many overseas participants.
“Many of the overseas exhibitors are here for the first time and will be looking to find business partners in Sri Lanka. We hope this will lead to more investments and trade opportunities.”
The three-day expo with 150 exhibiting companies and brands from 14 countries displaying their products will conclude tomorrow.
