India welcomes political resolve in Sri Lanka

 India welcomes the end of the political crisis in Sri Lanka, India's Foreign Ministry spokesman Raveesh Kumar said Monday, noting that such a result demonstrates political maturity of the main forces and institutions of the country."As a neighbor and sincere friend, India welcomes the resolution of the current political situation in Sri Lanka. That outcome is a reflection of the maturity of all political forces, as well as the strength of the Sri Lankan democracy and its institutions. India intends to further develop its people-centered projects in Sri Lanka. We are sure that the relations between two countries will continue on that upward trajectory," Kumar told journalists.
