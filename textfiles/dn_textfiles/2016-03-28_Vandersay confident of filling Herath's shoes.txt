Vandersay confident of filling Herath's shoes

DELHI: Promising 26-year-old right-arm leg-spinner Jeffrey Vandersay said that he was confident of filling the shoes of left-arm spinner Rangana Herath if given the opportunity.
"As a spinner Herath is a legend. He has done so much for our cricket. As a personal point of view, if I am given those shoes to fill it will be massive shoes to fill. It will take lot of time, but if I get the opportunity I will do it," said Vandersay who in a short space of time - in eight months has represented his country in a World Cup T20 tournament and appeared in 8 T20 Internationals and 3 ODIs.
"The World T20 has been helpful to spinners. A lot of spinners have done well especially the leg-spinners. I am happy to do well for my team and contribute in some way," said Vandersay.
"Yesterday the pitch wasn't spinning as much like some of the other wickets you have seen in India. I thought it will spin and I tried to get some spin. Then I tried to fire it in and not let the batsman get runs off me. The key for you as a spinner is to bowl dot balls in this format and not to get hit for boundaries. The length is the key. The England spinners gave a bit of width and that helped us," he said.
Vandersay is confident the present team given time will develop into a good fighting unit.
"Though we are out of the competition we fight hard. That's the Sri Lankan spirit. We would not take things lightly and we will play to win," said Vandersay.
"We have a young team. We lost three big names in the past year. We are a team in the rebuilding and I am sure we will do well in the longer run," he said.
