Flexible office hours in  Battaramulla

The staff of Public Offices in Battaramulla will enjoy flexible office hours from September 18 on wards in an attempt to reduce the entrance of vehicles to the City during office peak hours, said Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka.
The measure is taken in the government's bid to reduce the traffic congestion in Colombo in its attempt to save around Rs. 1 billion wasted on roads daily. The minister said due to traffic congestion, the waste of fuel and time of the people has been estimated to be around Rs. One billion.
He made these observation at a press conference held at the Ministry Auditorium in Suhurupaya, Battaramulla.
Minister Ranawaka also that the staff of the public sector in Battaramulla would be allowed to report to their offices from 7.30 am to 9.15 with the consent of their heads, while they also have the opportunity of leaving the office after covering the due number of working hours. They would be allowed to get off from work between 3.15 pm to 5 pm.
"However, they would have to work from 9.15 pm to 3.15 pm. This has to be done with the mutual understanding between the officers and their heads," Minister Ranawaka pointed out. He further said the government had spent approximately around Rs One trillion during 2005 to 2014 on the construction of roads in the country. He added that around 40 percent of the loans had been taken to construct these roads. "The construction of roads has facilitated easy transportation, but have not solved the issue of traffic congestion in Colombo."
Minister Ranawaka said there are 41 public offices including ministries located in Battaramulla and another 113 have to be shifted to Battaramulla during the next three years.
"As a solution to traffic congestion in Colombo, the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry took measures to introduce Priority Bus Lanes which is successful, except near Parliamenmt," Minister Ranawaka said.
"We have studied that if 1,450 buses ply along the road in Battaramulla in an hour, the average speed of the vehicles is around 10 kmph. But if we can reduce the number of vehicles by 250, we can increase the average speed to 20 kmph."
He also invited the private bus owners to use quality buses for transporting commuters. He added that the first private bus is displayed at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) premises for exhibition.
