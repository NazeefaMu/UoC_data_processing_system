Smart Furniture comes to Sri Lanka

Head of Fair Deal AS, Jan Erik Groos said that his company has earned wide recognition for the manufacture of stylish smart furniture; exclusive bedroom suites sets in conformity with European recognised standards and internationally accepted quality certifications.
Premium quality raw materials are used in the manufacturing process of the smart furniture, which is designed by accomplished and acclaimed furniture designers in Italy and Norway.
The final products are manufactured by recognized company in China, which specialises in the production of exclusive smart furniture.
With branches in Norway and the European countries, Fair Deal Smart Furniture Company is now on the lookout for authorized sales dealers to officially market its world-class products within Sri Lanka, the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce said.
A person who invests in smart furniture makes a substantial saving over a long period of time because instead of tying up capital to build two or three rooms, he can easily fit in the smart furniture into a single room for hassle-free use without crowding or cluttering the available space.
The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce in collaboration with Fair Deal AS, a multinational company, has taken the initiative to introduce the smart furniture concept to apartment complexes and city hotel projects for the first time in Sri Lanka.
Local entrepreneurs interested in joining hands with the promotion of this innovative trend in ‘smart living’ are welcome to team up with The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce to take this novel concept to greater heights for the benefit of the country.
Yasura Samarakoon, Head of Business and Trade Promotion at The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce says that the organization, in partnership with the Norwegian multinational company Fair Deal AS, was able to implement a large number of business and trade promotion projects in Sri Lanka over the past many years.
At competitive prices, smart furniture provides the total solution to apartments, hotels and homes particularly in heavily populated urban areas, where space has become a luxury.
