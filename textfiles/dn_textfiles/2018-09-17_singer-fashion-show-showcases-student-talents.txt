Singer Fashion Show showcases student talents

The Singer Fashion Show and awards ceremony 2018 was held recently, at the Bishops College Auditorium and marked the annual showcase of designs and creations of Diploma students from the Singer Fashion Academy.
Their efforts were rewarded during the Awards Ceremony which took place simultaneously during the course of the Fashion Show.
The Fashion Show and Awards ceremony is conducted every year and both spectacles are considered as the main events for the Singer Fashion Academy as well as the highlight of the Academy where diploma students receive the opportunity to showcase their creative streaks via a catwalk to a larger audience.
This in turn allows them to forge for themselves a platform that would not only give them a sense of confidence but also pave way for a wider range of business opportunities.
The awards ceremony took place and ran parallel to the Fashion Show which included seven glamorous fashion segments namely Kandyan wear, office wear, kids wear, gents wear, evening wear, casual wear and Indian wear. The fashion show prize recipients were selected as the winner, 1st runner-up and 2nd runner-up. The awards ceremony also presented respective certificates for all students who had successfully completed their Diploma in Scientific Dress Making and Diploma in Machine Embroidery.
Overall winners from the afore-mentioned fashion categories were placed to receive certificates acknowledging their work along with valuable prizes.
Each student who would have taken up in the Fashion Show was also applicable to receive a Certificate of Participation.
Amongst the valuable prizes that were given away were modern portable sewing machines for the fashion show winner under each category as well as for the All-Island Best Achiever from the Diploma exams.

Now our two Diploma programs and four other courses including the recently introduced Certificate in Fashion Designing program has been validated by the Charted Society of Designers UK (CSD) through their course endorsement program.
