SA names  Invitation XI against Sri Lanka

 
CAPE TOWN: Omphile Ramela will lead the South African Invitation XI in the three-day tour match against Sri Lanka to be played at Senwes Park in Potchefstroom from December 18 to 20.
A left-hander with the temperament of a scholar Ramela is unusual for a South African cricketer in all the right ways. He is one of a handful of black African batsmen to make their name in the longer format and one of a select group of professional players with a degree behind his name. Ramela, who also speaks five different languages, was studying towards a Masters in Economics while captaining the Cobras.
The match comes two days after the T20 Challenge final and before the Sunfoil Series resumes in January, assuring there is no clash with franchise cricket.
“We see this match as a wonderful opportunity to see what some of our younger players, who have shown good form in franchise cricket this season, can do against quality opposition,” commented Cricket South Africa (CSA) selection convener Linda Zondi.
“This is a good chance for these players to show what they can do at the next level.
“We have also included a number of provincial players who stood out in the Africa T20 Cup or for the SA academy team.
“It is important that these younger players have some experience to feed off and this will be provided by the likes of Ramela and Dane Piedt.”
