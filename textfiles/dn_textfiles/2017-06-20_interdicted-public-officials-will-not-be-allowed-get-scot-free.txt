Interdicted public officials will not be allowed to get off scot-free

 
No public official interdicted for alleged misappropriation of public or State property will be allowed to go scot-free, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister and the State Minister of Mahaweli Development Mahinda Amaraweera said.
“The law will be implemented to the letter them. Not only will they be sent to jail but action will be taken to forfeit all the robbed state property,” he said.
The Minister said that under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena, nobody would be able to steal public property.
Allegations have been leveled against the government by various groups that claim the government has failed to take action against those who committed crimes and corruption during the previous regime.
“Investigations are currently on-going with regard to the alleged crimes and corruptions. But the government cannot intervene with the legal procedure. True facts with respect of the CBSL bond scam issue have now been revealed,” the State Minister said.
“The good governance government was not formed to safeguard thieves,” he further reiterated.
