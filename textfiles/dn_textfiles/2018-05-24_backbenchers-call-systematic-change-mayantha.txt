Backbenchers call for  systematic change - Mayantha

Changing the structure of the party was no easy task but the backbenchers were not yet ready to give up the push for it, said UNP backbencher Mayantha Dissanayake.
Speaking at a media briefing at the Parliamentary Complex yesterday, the MP was answering questions posed by journalists on the recent UNP party reforms.
“It is true that many of our supporters on the ground are not happy with how things have played out but we need to introduce change in a systematic manner,” he further said.
UNP backbenchers especially have been leading the call for reforms within the party and this was further intensified after the losses faced by the UNP at the last Local Government elections.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who promised changes, took steps to introduce a new body called the politburo, consisting of younger ministers and made changes to several party leadership positions.
Meanwhile, Telecommunications, Digital Infrastructure and Foreign Employment Minister Harin Fernando at an event held at his Ministry yesterday said that the party has to show its supporters of what it is capable of and earn their confidence.
“The UNP has to show a big difference to the public within 3 or 4 months. We already had discussions for a comprehensive three year plan with the Prime Minister. We have to show our supporters of what we are capable of and earn our trust back,” Minister Fernando said.
The Unity Government consisted of ministers whom we liked and did not like and they all came and went. We did not have any issue with it. However, it is evident now that the journey our government embarked was delayed and disrupted by the ministers who quit the Unity Government. The people also lost their trust in the government cause of their actions.
However, there is an emerging leadership in the government and the top level leadership understands this which is a good sign.
