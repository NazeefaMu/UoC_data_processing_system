Northern people will never support armed struggles again: Mano Ganeshan

Northern people will never speak about armed struggles again. If anyone in the North tried to propound an armed struggle, the masses themselves would assault him before police intervene, National Dialogue and Official Languages Minister Mano Ganeshan said. Addressing a meeting at the Hall de Galle in Galle, the minister said the country's march towards development had been blocked by communalism.
It was people of the north who suffered most from the war. War had become anathema for the northern people. The north today has no place for an armed struggle or separatism, the minister said. He said he has few friends in the political field trying to spread communal hatred for political gain.
He requested them fervently not to try and jeopardise the unity in the country. "No one would be allowed to take the country towards a war situation again," he said.
