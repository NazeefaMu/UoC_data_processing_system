ISSO opens in Colpetty!

ISSO, Colombo’s favourite prawn restaurant, opened their brand new outlet with a renewed and exciting menu for seafood lovers in Colpetty.
With a strong focus on the freshness and the quality of the ingredients used in their food, ISSO fast became a favourite among foodies when the restaurant initially opened doors to customers in 2016 at Sulaiman Terrace. With their newest venture, ISSO evolves from being a prawn-only restaurant to offer a refresh and mouth-watering seafood menu to their customers; with a bonus vegetarian option.
“We are very excited to present our latest outlet at Ananda Coomaraswamy Mawatha (Green Path), where Colombo’s foodies can now indulge in a variety of prawn and other seafood options of their choice. If there is one thing Sri Lankans love as an island nation, it’s their prawns and seafood and we have introduced some really interesting combinations to our menuto cater to the taste buds of all our customers,” Co-founders of ISSO Apinash Sivagumaaran, Fawaz Fassi and Shuaib Yusoofsaid.
“From the beginning we wanted to create a brand with a truly local identity and we wanted it to be something that we could also take out into the world.The ISSO concept was fresh and straight forward, and caught on to the market pretty well. So after two years in operation we wanted to present something even bigger and better to our customers. That is why we decided to expand,by opening our new outlet and introducing more delectablemenu options. We are very excited for Colombo to try out what we have in store for them,” they added.
With their latest restaurant, ISSO has introduced a bigger prawn size giving customers 4 different prawn sizes to choose from. Additionally, they offer three new seafood options including lobster and a delicious vegetarian option. The restaurant hasalso introduced a range of specials, soups, starters and a kids menu.
