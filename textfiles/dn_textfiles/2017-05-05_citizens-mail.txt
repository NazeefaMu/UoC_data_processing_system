Citizens' Mail

THAI COURTESIES FOR ELDERS
A few days ago I was in Bangkok in connection with the annual Songkran celebrations which coincide with our Sinhala New Year celebrations.
During my visit I had to use the SKY TRAIN or BTS as the Thais usually refer it to.
At one of the stations I had to change the currency note I had into coins so as to purchase the ticket from the vending machine.
Once I got the change in coins I went to the vending machine and was checking the fare applicable to my journey and was about to insert the coins into the machine when a female security officer came up to me and indicated that the officer at the ticket counter wanted me to come.
I was surprised as I had done no wrong.
When I went up to her she requested for my passport.
I usually never carry my passport with me when travelling in Thailand but on this particular day since I was carrying my brief case with me I had my passport which I produced. She opened it and went through the personal details and saw her noting some thing down. A few minutes later she handed my passport back and also gave me a Green Colour Ticket and said I need not pay for the journey as I was a Senior Citizen even though not a Thai National. Usually this journey of about 12 kilometres would have cost about 40 to 50 Bhat or about US$ 1.50. I thanked her, and went on the journey.
On the return, about 2 hours later too I was given the same FREE Travel facility.
I don’t know if this facility was just for that day only or it’s the usual practice in Thailand.
I know for subways they give a discount of 50% to Senior Citizens.
I hope our own transport authorities will follow their good example.
Thank you THAILAND for courtesies offered to Senior Citizens
