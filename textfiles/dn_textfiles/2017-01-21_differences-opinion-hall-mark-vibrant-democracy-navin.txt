Differences of opinion, a hall mark of vibrant democracy: Navin

 The main parties of the National Unity Government had no issue that could not be solved by way of discussion, Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake said yesterday.
He said the understanding between the UNP and the SLFP in the government is vibrant and remains strong although there are differences in ideas.
He added President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe are confident over their unity to run the National Unity government, although those of the opposition speculate of a split not knowing the fact in a democracy, people are entitled to hold different views within the government. Minister Dissanayake was speaking at a press conference at the Plantation Industries Ministry Auditorium. “The opposition might have misunderstood Minister Sajith Premadasa’s emotional statements made at the Cabinet against the curtailment of his funds by the Finance Ministry,” Minister Dissanayake.
“Even I did the same when the Finance Minister attempted to curtail funds from my ministry. The Finance Minister might have reasons to do so and so have I reasons to object,” Minister Dissanayake said.
He also said that that is the democracy within the government. “Our right to speak and object at the cabinet in the government is guaranteed,” Minister Dissanayke said. When a media personnel questioned about the President’s decision to fix the price of a lottery ticket at Rs.20 when an attempt was made to increase it to Rs.30, the minister said that it was a good trend that would benefit the people. He added that many of members were of the view that the price of the lottery ticket should not be increased. “No body needs a rubber stamp President of a rubber stamp Prime Minister,” Minister Dissanayake said.
“When there is Check and Balance it is good for democracy.”
