Nawaloka petroleum expands operations

Nawaloka Petroleum (Pvt) Ltd, a fully-owned subsidiary of Nawaloka Holdings Limited recently announced its plan for 2018 to expand operations in a bid to become the preferred automotive solutions provider in the country.
Established in 2010, the company has in a short span of 8 years become the complete solutions provider with products ranging from lubricants to batteries and tires.
The Nawaloka Petroleum product range includes globally recognized brands such as total and Elf Lubricants, volta and Nawata batteries and Deestone, Royal Black, Austone and Sportrak tires. Through strong ties with multi-nationals, Nawaloka Petroleum has been trusted by global vehicular giants like Tata, Renault, Maruti, Peugeot, Nissan, Citroen and Kia.
Total Oil is the 4th largest oil company in the world and their lubricant oils, greases, break fluids and coolants are marketed and distributed solely by Nawaloka Petroleum under the Total and Elf brand names.
Meanwhile, powering the nation’s transportation sector Nawaloka Petroleum’s very own brand Nawata batteries are built to German technology at the largest battery manufacturing plant in South Asia located in Bangladesh.
Also in Nawaloka Petroleum’s portfolio is the “Volta” battery. Imported from Rahimafrooz Accumulators Limited (RAL) in Bangladesh, this battery perfectly suits the varying weather conditions of a tropical nation as it is developed in one. High standards of its operations are certified by both ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 standards.
