India Women take winning lead in T20I series

India romped home to a seven-wicket victory over Sri Lanka Women in the fourth T20I played at the Colombo Cricket Club ground yesterday.
India Women sealed the five-match T20I series against Sri Lanka with this win taking an unassailable 3-0 lead with one match to play. The second match of the series was washed out by rain.
Sri Lanka were off to a brisk start as opener Yasoda Mendis smashes two fours in the first over, but off-spinner Anuja Patil struck twice to remove Mendis and number three Hasini Perera in quick succession.
Apart from a 32-ball knock for 40 from experienced all rounder Shashikala Siriwardene and 31 off 26 balls from skipper Chamari Atapattu the rest of the Lankan Women could not put up any worthwhile contribution as they were restricted to a total of 134-7 in 7 overs in the rain restricted match.
India chased down the target in 15.4 overs losing three wickets. An unbroken 96-run fourth wicket stand between eighteen-year-old Jemimah Rodrigues who made her second consecutive half-century (52 not out in 37 balls, 5 fours, 2 sixes) and Anuja Patil (54 not out in 42 balls, 7 fours) saw India home comfortably.
Pacer Oshadi Ranasinghe dismissed both the Indian openers Smriti Mandhana and Mithali Raj in her first over and also picked up the wicket of Taniya Bhatia but India recovered through their fourth wicket pair.
The last T20I of the five match series will be played on Tuesday at Katunayake.
Scores:
Sri Lanka Women 134-5 in 17 overs (Shashikala Siriwardene 40; Chamari Atapattu 31, Anuja Patil 3/36)
India Women 137-3 in 15.4 overs (Jemimah Rodrigues 52 n.o., Anuja Patil 54 n.o.; Oshadi Ranasinghe 3/33)
