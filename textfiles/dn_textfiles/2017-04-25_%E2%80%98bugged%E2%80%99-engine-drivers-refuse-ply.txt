‘Bugged’ engine drivers refuse to ply

A passenger train scheduled to ply from Polgahawela to Ratmalana had to be cancelled yesterday with the two engine drivers refusing to operate the train citing fatigue as they had spent a sleepless night in the retiring room due to ‘Bed Bugs’.
The train which leaves Polgahawela station at 5.30 am carrying around 2000 passengers daily during the early morning rush hour had to be cancelled as the drivers refused to operate the train citing the ‘Bug’ issue, Railway authorities at Polgahawela said. The Station Master at Polgahawela  while confirming the incident said the two drivers were adamant despite his appeals.
He said that he had requested a written statement from the two drivers citing reasons for their refusal. He also admitted that a large number of people, mostly state and private sector workers were highly inconvenienced due to the cancellation. It is learnt that the contract to clear bugs in the station is handled by a private company. They were seen busy at work at the Polgahawela station following the incident, sources said.
Meanwhile, sources at the Polgahawela station said that engine drivers and their assistants who use the retiring rooms at the station had rented rooms at the nearby Rest House due to the bed bug issue.
