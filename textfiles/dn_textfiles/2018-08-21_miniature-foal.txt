MINIATURE FOAL

Furry animals which are smaller in size are some of the most adored creatures preferred as companions. But while breeds of canines and cats are popular, some unlikely animals with rare conditions also turn out to be surprisingly lovable.
Horses are known for their firm build which makes them ideal for riding, but a miniature horse in Russia is an exception to this idea associated with the creatures. The pony named Gulliver is just 19.29 inches from hoof to shoulder blades.
The American miniature horse was the size of a cat when it was born at Russia’s Hidalgo pony farm in 2017. Gulliver seemed content to be the bigger animal for a change as it played with a dog at a recent show.
The miniature horse is smaller than most others from his breed as most of them are 34 inches tall. This makes him a contender for the Guinness World Record as the smallest living male horse.
