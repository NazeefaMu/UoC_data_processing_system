BJP slams DMK on Sri Lankan issue

The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam have contributed very little to the State’s development, Union Minister Pon Radhakrishnan said on Sunday.
Addressing a public meeting to highlight the four- year achievements of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Central Government, he said the two political parties had only divided people on caste and religious lines.
The DMK that usually highlighted the Tamil cause was guilty of betraying the Tamils in Sri Lanka by being a part of the UPA government at the Centre, which helped the Sri Lankan government.
DMK president M. Karunanidhi had also staged a fast and then ended it saying the war had ended. Trusting his words, many Tamils in Sri Lanka who came out were killed, . Radhakrishnan said, and wanted to know what was the present DMK president’s response to what the former Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa had said in this regard.
The Minister said the Central Government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi was concerned about the State’s development and that was why the Centre’s allocation to the State in the past four years at Rs. 98,914 crore was higher than the UPA Government’s allocation of Rs. 56,971 crore during 2009-14.
Highlighting allocations made under various schemes and the number of beneficiaries under each scheme, Radhakrishnan said the State had benefited much more under the Modi-led government than any other.
The then DMK president M. Karunanidhi had also staged a fast and then ended it saying the war had ended. Trusting his words, many Tamils in Sri Lanka who came out were killed, Radhakrishnan said, and wanted to know what was the present DMK president’s response to what the former Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa had said in this regard.
