Polmama: Nonagenarian vegetarian

Ninety-seven-year old R.G. M. Dingiri Banda of Pahala Polwatta, Karaliyadde, Teldeniya, still looks agile and sturdy and belies his age as a nonagenarian.
He still engaes in his lifelong small business of selling coconuts. He is such an omini-present individual in the Dumbara Valley that he had earned the sobriquet, 'pol mama'.
Dingiri Banda, who claims a long list of grandchildren, attributes his good health to his frugal and disciplined life and dietary habits. He says he takes a vegetarian diet and eats a lot of fruits. Liquor has been a taboo throughout his life.
He is the oldest member of Sri Uposatharama Viharaya Dayaka sabha at Karaliyadde and makes it a point to observe sil on all poya days. He was born on January 20,1920 at Gampola but later moved to Karaliyadde and settled down there during his youth.
He says his eyesight is clear still and reads books and newspapers daily.
He started his business a long time ago when a coconut cost a meagre five cents. During his youth, he collected coconuts from home gardens on a bullock cart and delivered to sathipolas (weekly fairs) in the area. Although he had given up that big time business now, he still engages in his simple coconut business.
