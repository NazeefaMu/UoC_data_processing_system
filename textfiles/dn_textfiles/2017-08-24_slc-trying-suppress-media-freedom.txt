Is SLC trying to suppress media freedom?

The Sri Lanka pre-match media conference took a new turn at the Pallekele International Stadium where the media men covering it were asked to restrict their questions to just four and all of them pertaining only to the second ODI between Sri Lanka and India starting today.
Those were the strict instructions given to the media manager by Sri Lanka Cricket’s executive co-ordinator management committee Vrai Raymond who made a surprise visit to the conference and was trying to control the number of questions that was being thrown at captain Upul Tharanga and coach Nic Pothas who were present.
However despite several attempts to curtail the questions the mediamen had it their way and the conference dragged on in English and Sinhala.
The media were of the view that yesterday’s incident was a result of what Pothas had to tell the media at the end of the first ODI at Dambulla on Sunday where Sri Lanka were beaten by nine wickets.
Pothas said that “too many cooks” were spoiling his attempts to revive the Sri Lanka team.
“If it was up to me and we had control over what we did, then we could probably give you a timeline. It’s a question you probably need to ask a few other people as well. For me, if we were left alone and you could work with this group of players, you could get some stability and consistency over a period of six months. You’d see massive improvements,” said Pothas.
Thus Tharanga and Pothas were required to make a statement prior to the commencement of the press conference.
