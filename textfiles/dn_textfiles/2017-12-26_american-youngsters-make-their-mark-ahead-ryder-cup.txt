American youngsters make their mark ahead of Ryder Cup

PARIS: The rising generation of Americans dominated the 2017 season after Spaniard Sergio Garcia’s memorable Masters triumph, laying down a marker ahead of next year’s Ryder Cup in Paris.
Brooks Koepka, 27, claimed the US Open title, before Jordan Spieth’s third major crown at the British Open and his fellow 24-year-old Justin Thomas’ breakthrough victory at the USPGA Championship.
Add in world number one Dustin Johnson, and United States Ryder Cup captain Jim Furyk has a formidable team more than capable of repeating October’s Presidents Cup thrashing of the Internationals.
The US are the favourites to retain the trophy come next September at Golf National, but they haven’t won on European soil since 1993 at The Belfry.
“We have 25 years of scars to overcome,” Furyk said in Paris in October. “I don’t want (them) going in there being overconfident that they are the greatest team.
I want them going in with a chip on their shoulder that they have something to prove.” Europe’s stars had a mixed season, although 37-year-old Garcia produced the year’s stand-out moment by finally ending his wait for a major title by edging out Justin Rose in a thrilling Masters play-off back in April.
Garcia’s compatriot Jon Rahm stole a few headlines by rising to world number four in his first full season as a professional, but four-time major winner Rory McIlroy was plagued by injuries and loss of form as he failed to win an event for the first year since 2008.
