Petrol shipment arriving tonight

The petrol shortage will come to an end by noon tomorrow (9) with a fuel shipment reaching Sri Lanka by 9 pm today (8), Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranthunga yesterday.
He said that it was predicted that the fuel ship will reach Sri Lanka by 11 pm today but it has been calculated by observing the position of the ship via satellite that the ship will reach the country around 9 pm today.
“With the shipment reaching the harbour today, distribution will enable consumers to obtain fuel by noon tomorrow,” Minister Ranathunga said.
The Minister was responding to a query by Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena on the issue. Ranathunga stated he was sure of the quality of the fuel shipment as he had assigned two persons to get it inspected before distribution.
