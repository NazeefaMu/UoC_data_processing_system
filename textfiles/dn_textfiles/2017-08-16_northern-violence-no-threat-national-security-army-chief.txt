Northern violence no threat to national security: Army chief

Recent violent incidents against police and a high court judge in the North were local issues. The situation does not constitute a threat to national security, Army Commander Lt. General Mahesh Senanayaka said at a press briefing in Colombo yesterday.
Senanayaka faced questions from reporters about increased police and military presence in the region. Security officials have increased patrols following the murder of a policeman in Jaffna in July and an attack on two more in Kopai a week later.
The Army Commander did not deny the heightened police and military presence in the North. But he said the attacks were local incidents, and should not be considered as part of a wider movement.
“Everyone is trying to link each and every isolated incident to national security,” he said.
Speaking about the man accused of attacking the judge and killing a police officer, “yes, he had an LTTE background,” he said. “But he was in the organisation in 1996.”
Senanayaka said if similar attacks took place in the South, no one would think they were connected to a wider national security issue.
“These are natural things that happen in a society after a war,” he said.
