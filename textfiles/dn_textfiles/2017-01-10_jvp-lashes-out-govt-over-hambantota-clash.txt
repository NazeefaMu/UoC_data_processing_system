JVP lashes out  at Govt. over  Hambantota clash

The Janatha Vimukthi Preramuna (JVP) yesterday said what happened in Hambanthota on Saturday mirrored intensification of mass suppression.
The Peramuna’s Propaganda Secretary Vijitha Herath said just as the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime used aggressive repression against the people during its administration, using force, arrest and detention, the present Maithripala-Ranil government too is using repressive action against the public.
Herath was speaking at a press conference at the JVP head office in Battaramulla where the JVP higher-ups criticised the government for the situation that in Hambantota on Saturday where at least 21 persons were injured during a protest.
The JVP was categorical in stating that the incident was the result of the government using brutal force to suppress the voice of the people who had taken to the streets to prevent their lands being seized by the government against their will and leased out to a Chinese company to set up an industrial zone.
Herath said: “Our country should have more industries, there is no question about that, but there is no point in setting up industries at the cost of people losing their ancestral lands in Hambantota. The government is wielding a heavy hand on national lands, and trying to forcibly acquire these lands. We will not let that happen.”
“The government is trying to gain an advantage over their ineptitude of governance by selling the people’s lands for a song to foreign companies so that they may survive yet another day in the government,” he said.
The JVP is demanded that the government stop forcible acquisition of people’s lands in Hambantota and also wrap up their plans to sell the Hambantota harbour.
He said a group of bankrupt politicians are igniting the situation on behalf of the government to pave their way into political office. “We will not let that happen,” Herath said .
