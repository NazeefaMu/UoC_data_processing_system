Beyond The Clouds
Beautiful but obnoxious

The rustic settings of Marc Forster’s ‘The Kite Runner’ based on Khaled Hosseini’s renowned novel of the same name comes to mind when you go through the first few scenes of Iranian director Majid Majidi’s ‘Beyond the Clouds’.
However the similarities end there as we find an entirely new story with a novel plot unfolding in the picture. We meet Amir, a youth who makes hard earned cash by smuggling drugs and transporting them on motorbike. In one such assignment he meets with a spot of bother as police breaks into their hideaway. Amir rescues one of his colleagues from the clutches of the police and makes off with them hot on his heels. Finally it is Amir’s estranged sister who comes to his rescue as she and one of her acquaintances at the market, Akshi hides him under a bundle of clothes till the cops pass out of sight.
Later Akshi wants the favour returned and makes sexual advances on Tara. She hits out at him, badly injuring him in the struggle. While he is bundled off to hospital Tara is awaiting trial for attempted murder. Amir works hard to keep Akshi alive so that he can admit to his crime and set Tara free. Meantime he also becomes an involuntary guardian to Akshi’s two daughters and his mother.
Thus the two lives of the brother and sister run parallel to each other in two settings. Though the scenes look grim on the outside we do find a couple of touching episodes in each of these environs. For example while Tara becomes the surrogate mother to a motherless child in prison, Amir bonds with Akshi’s daughters despite trying to sell the 10-year-old to a sex trafficker.
The beauty in Majidi’s production lies in how even the tiniest kind gesture gives an enormous tug to your heartstrings. The drawback mostly lies on trying to crowd too much of the social issues related to drug dealing youth onto one character’s shoulders. Not only does Amir have to deal with having to keep Akshi alive, look after his family and earn cash the immoral way but he also has to play a cat and mouse game when friends turn to foes.
Centering on the themes of good vs evil the film colours the Indian setting vividly, contrasting them with the moods of the characters in browns, grays and blacks. It also highlights many facets of rural India.
The actors too do full justice to their roles. Ishaan Khattar makes a very convincing Amir while Malavika Mohanan gives a commendable performance as Tara. The rest of the characters – even the most minute ones – play their parts well.
Heartwarming in one minute while becoming heavy handed the next second, ‘Beyond the Clouds’ steps well ahead of many of the melodramas made today.
