Teachers strike

Police averted a major clash between teacher trade unions over the government’s decision to promote whom trade unions alleged were unqualified persons to hold such posts in the education sector. A tense situation erupted opposite the Education Ministry premises in Battaramulla yesterday when teachers on strike against the recent promotions encountered officers who were promoted by the government recently.
