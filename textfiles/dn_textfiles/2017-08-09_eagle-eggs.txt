EAGLE EGGS

Short story:
‘Father, father, wake up, wake up! The sky is blue.’ It’s the voice of the eaglet, the first child of the third generation of the Pathirage lineage. Pathirages are well-respected and the most educated in the vicinity of Boralukada, a bucolic hamlet in the south of Sri Lanka. Yet, the voice was heard in a faraway clime, Brisbane in Australia, the country of the aborigines. It is said that the VEDDHAS in Sri Lanka and the ABORIGINES in Australia have similar dispositions.
Thisara and Amalka left for Australia nearly after six months of their nuptial ceremony. Thisara is the second son of the school teacher couple, Wansa and Indrani. The newly wedded couple made their nest in Everton Park on Bullers lane as Amalka’s husband had to read for his doctorate in civil engineering at a prestigious university there.
Thisara being gifted with ultra-active intelligence and imagination not only in the spheres of academic pursuits but also in mundane life left no stone unturned to make their conjugal life a resounding success. His spouse plays no second fiddle to him and she was able to join a child caring institute in the locality adjacent to their dwelling on account of her good command of the Queen’s lingo and her sagacity.
Himath Keshawa, fondly called by all near and dear ones ‘HIMA’ is the eaglet, the third generation child of the Pathirage pedigree. He is the father like son and in every childhood feat he shows hidden genius and his cute behaviour is constantly promoted by his keen mother, Amalka.
It was the homecoming celebration of the above couple and the huge gathering in the spacious compound tells the tale of the social standing of the Pathirage family. Almost all, the rich and the poor had been invited to the maiden wedding ceremony of the family of four sons whose mother had left them in a tragic accident.
The eldest son being a doctor, Thisara a reputed young engineer, the third in the row Chamara a charted accountant and the youngest Isuru being a first year engineering student at the University of Moratuwa, the invitees to the grand occasion were a mixed crowd. All were mingling freely and their father Wansa, in high spirits, moderately intoxicated took some of us to very strange sight.
It was veritably very strange we could find a huge eagle protecting four eagle eggs. All were very inquisitive to know the untold history in cement and Wansa told us that he had protected his four motherless children like a mother eagle protecting her eggs.
The eagle is synonymous with keen eye sight. Everyone appreciated Wansa for bringing up his children after the untimely death of their beloved mother. The story did not end there, in our very presence; he took one of the four eggs and vanished.
As Amalka’s father I have been trying my best to trace the place where my cousin had kept that eagle egg. He came out of his hiding place and told that the four eggs had symbolized four children and one was released to live his own life. Two years later another egg was removed in the same manner when Chamara, the third son was wedded to Sasika, a medical doctor.
‘HIMA’ is the eaglet, the third generation pride.
