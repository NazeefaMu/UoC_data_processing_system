MAS employs participates at Piwithuru Karunawa

MAS participated in a project at the close of this year’s season. “Piwithuru Karunawa” organised by TNL Rhythm World and executed by MAS employees recently. MAS has a strong ethos of sustainability within which was seen at work on Sri Pada through the diligence of the teams who refused to stop even when the bags were splitting at the seams. There were others who took personal risks to crawl out and collect a hidden piece of polythene on steep rocks and branches.
MAS has goal to be zero waste by 2020 and a greater vision to make its waste a raw material by 2025. All MAS facilities drive waste segregation and recycling projects as well sustainability focused innovations to reduce their own footprint.
Dedicated teams also work for a bigger vision set by the group. This core plan is what the company calls the Change Inside and says it is this collective consciousness that came together for Sri Pada.
MAS hopes to share its waste management practices and projects with all who are keen to ensure Sri Lanka remains free of waste in the future.
