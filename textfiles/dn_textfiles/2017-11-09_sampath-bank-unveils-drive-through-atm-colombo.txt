Sampath Bank unveils  Drive-through ATM in Colombo

In line with its commitment to providing the highest levels of service to its customers, Sampath Bank commissioned a drive-through automated teller machine (ATM) at its Colombo Super Branch premises located at Dharmapala Mawatha, Colombo 07.
The ATM was unveiled by Nanda Fernando, Managing Director, Sampath Bank, in the presence of members of the Bank’s Corporate Management, on November 7.
The drive-through ATM provides Sampath Bank customers with a host of services. Customers of other banks too can withdraw cash at this ATM using their American Express, Cirrus, Diner’s Club, Mastercard, Maestro, Union Pay and Visa credit and debit cards.
Located securely within the branch premises, it provides an added layer of safety and convenience as patrons of the ATM can drive in through a dedicated entry driveway and access its services from within their vehicles, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.
The new ATM joins Sampath Bank’s network of 387 ATMs islandwide, which includes Sri Lanka’s first banking robot that works in the form of a humanoid teller that was unveiled at the Bank’s Head Quarters branch recently. Sampath Bank has strengthened this network further by joining LankaPay, the largest ATM network in the country, which enables customers to transact at over 3,000 ATMs island wide.
