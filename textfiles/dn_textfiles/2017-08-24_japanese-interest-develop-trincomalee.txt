Japanese interest to develop Trincomalee

On August 21, Japanese Ambassador to Sri Lanka Kenichi Suganuma paid a courtesy visit on Eastern Province Governor Rohitha Bogollagama and exchanged views on economic and social development in the Eastern Province, including the city development of Trincomalee District.
The Ambassador said that Singapore and ADB had been invited to draw plans to develop Trincomalee, while Japan had shown interest to be part of the process.
Ambassador Kenichi Suganuma remembered his previous visit to the Eastern Province and expressed his appreciation for the commitment and dedication of the Eastern Province in rebuilding infrastructure facilities and extensive training programmes with a special focus on women’s participation and empowerment.
Meanwhile, Governor Bogollagama said, discussions on Trincomalee Industrial Development had been made with the Prime Minister during the event in Eravur and said that there will be tremendous opportunities in the East. Japan is interested in developing the Trincomalee Port and developing an Industrial Development Zone in the District. The Government will also invest some funds in the Trincomalee Port Development Project to connect with the Ampara and Hambantota ports. The domestic airport in Batticaloa has already been developed. A number of other development projects as well as tourism projects will be implemented in the area. Governor Bogollagama expressed the interest of the President on the Hingurangoda Airport to connect with the Eastern Province.
The next step is to get Japan investments to construct the mega hotels, create job opportunities, increase income, to make domestic entrepreneurs more competitive, emphasized the Governor. The Governor remembered the opening ceremony of Sigiriya Museum by Japanese Premier and reiterated the invitation to Prime Minister of Japan for a visit to Eastern Province and he added, there are plans to improve the transit facilities to invite the East Indian tourists since the Eastern Province has 41 major natural resources and 420 km long sea coast.
“The Eastern Province, which has 760 sq. km watermarks and reached self-sufficiency in fishing,” the Governor showcased the remarkable progress it had made in the inland fisheries sector. He also briefed about the livestock development.
The Japanese Government had decided to provide a grant to the Northern, Eastern, Uva and North Central Provinces to rehabilitate the irrigation system and water supply, sewage and enable the people to resume their livelihoods with the aid of the Japanese Government.
“I am really impressed to see the development that took place in Eastern Province under the JICA Programme,” the Governor said. The benefits of boosting women’s participation in the workforce is not just about supporting human rights, it’s also about smart economics.
“We should be working very hard on getting employment opportunities for women,” Governor Bogollagama added and instructed the Chief Secretary of the Eastern Province to submit the progress review on the projects implemented by the Japanese Government.
The Chief Secretary described the details of the JICA Foreward Project, which focuses on communication and community empowerment, good governance and project management and entrepreneurship and livelihood development. New proposals are with the Deputy Chief Secretary.

Both sides should also expand non-governmental exchanges, implement the bilateral cooperative consensus in people's livelihood, inter-cultural engagement and further promote the cooperation in tourism and media exchange.
Governor Bogollagama also expressed about organizing a tour of Buddhist sites and explained about ancient Buddhist sites in the Eastern Province such as the Girihandusaya temple.
