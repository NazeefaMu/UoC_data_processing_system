Fight Cancer Team provides PET scan machine to Maharagama Cancer Hospital

The Fight Cancer Team, part of the Kadijah Foundation, held their annual meeting on Thursday night to celebrate its purchase of a PET scan machine for the Maharagama Cancer Hospital. The group raised over Rs. 250 million in less than 100 days to buy the machine. PET (Positron Emission Tomography) machines are considered the standard to detect many types of cancer.
PET scans are available at private hospitals, but are very expensive.
The barrier in the public sector is even higher. Kadijah Foundation President M. S. H. Mohamed delivered remarks about the need to support government hospitals to make sure all people have access to quality care. Dr. Gurpal Singh, an orthopaedic surgeon at the National University Cancer Institute in Singapore, spoke about the importance of early detection to treat bone cancer.Organisers said the Fight Cancer Team will become the Fight Cancer Trust to continue fundraising for cancer-prevention and treatment initiatives.
