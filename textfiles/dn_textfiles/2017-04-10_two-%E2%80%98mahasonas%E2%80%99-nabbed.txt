Two ‘Mahasonas’ nabbed

Two members of a movement known as Mahasona Balakaya were nabbed by the Ambalantota police. They were pasting posters in the Ambalantota town when they were arrested.
Consumers were warned in the posters to avoid buying anything from a certain sector of shops. The Ambalantota police said the suspects are residents of Ridiyagama, Ambalantota.
They had revealed on interrogation that they received the posters from Kandy.
