Dayasiri backs  SLC performance  evaluation

 
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara was of the view that the decision SLC has taken to pay national cricketers according to their performance is very appropriate. During a discussion with BBC’s Colombo reporter, the minister expressed surprise over some payments to national cricketers by SLC. “There is a player who has earned Rs 57 million last year. When calculated, SLC has payed Rs 57,000 for a single run he scored in the year. Another player got Rs 73 million which amounting Rs 26,000 for a single run. he further said.
Jayasekara said that the SLC officials are also members of cricket clubs and they always try to include maximum number of players from their clubs in the national side. This has happened in the past as well. “If the new mechanism serves unfair to national players, I will attend to their grievances,” he said.
“Performances of some players are way behind the expected level. But irrespective of their performance they earn big money from SLC. Players must have the attitude that they must do their job well to earn big money. There will be an inquiry into the allegations leveled against contracted players”.
The minister also revealed that a person is managing few cricketers in the national side and a player who did not wish to take him as his manager was pulled out from the team.
