Huge ‘sea tornado’ appears off Galle coast

A water spout had appeared off the coast of Galle yesterday, causing a huge sprouting fountain in the middle of the ocean.
People living close to the sea said that it had lasted for about five minutes. Some fishermen who had gone fishing had rushed back to the shore fearing a storm.
