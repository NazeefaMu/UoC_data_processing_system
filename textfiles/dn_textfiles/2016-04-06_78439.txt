Aravinda takes responsibility for Sri Lanka's poor display

 
The Chairman of Sri Lanka Cricket Selection Committee Aravinda De Silva said that he takes responsibility for Sri Lanka's poor display at the world Twenty20 tournament which concluded on Sunday in India. There were a lot of internal problems in the national team which may have resulted in Sri Lanka's inability to enter the semi-finals.
Aravinda made these remarks while addressing a seminar on Sri Lanka Cricket and its future at the National Library Services Board auditorium yesterday. Replying to an allegation made by Lasith Malinga that he was forced to play in the Twenty20 World Cup, De Silva said that he had received an Email from Lasith Malinga that he was in good health which was the reason why he selected Malinga for the tournament.
Aravinda said that the new selection committee headed by him and comprising Kumar Sangakkara, Romesh Kaluwitarana, Lalith Kaluperuma and Ranjith Madurasinghe was appointed just one day before the deadline for naming of the team for the tournament. We knew that a team had already been selected for the T-20 World Cup but made a few changes to strengthen the team so as the chairman of the selection committee he is taking responsibility for Lanka's poor display.
The former selection committee had picked Dinesh Chandimal as the captain but Chandimal had suggested that Mathews is more suitable to captain the team to the former selection committee but they had rejected it which resulted in a dispute in the team.
When selecting a team for the tournament the captain and coach should be consulted but the coach did not know till the last moment who the captain was.
There was no player in the batting line up who was able to step up the scoring rate. After they arrived in India the team realised that a leg spinner was necessary taking the condition of Indian pitches which are favouring spinners.
Former Sri Lanka Cricket captain and Minister of Ports and Shipping Arjuna Ranatunga said that a National Policy should be adopted to develop sports in the country. He also said that the coach and the captain of the National Cricket team should not be changed after a new administration takes over. Our duty is to prevent the decline of Sri Lanka Cricket.
