India lost 1% of its GDP to Modi’s hunt for elusive black money

Finally, the Reserve Bank of India has deigned to release the cold hard facts on Demonetisation.
Of Indian Rs 15.44 lakh crore worth of currency denotified, almost all came back, save currency worth Rs 16,000 crore.
The Central Statistics Office estimates India’s 2016-17 GDP to be Rs 151.84 lakh crore. That means black money worth 0.1% of GDP was extinguished.
To achieve that, 1% of GDP was sacrificed, if we go by the Economic Survey’s estimate of the impact of Demonetisation on economic growth. Demonetisation has been flop, as far as tackling black money is concerned.
But Demonetisation has been a big political success for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. People give him full credit for trying to rein in the illicit rich. And were willing to suffer some pain, if that would serve the larger public interest.
Of course, those with black money held as cash, a tiny fraction of unaccounted wealth, ended up with somewhat less black money: you had to part with some of the cash to get it laundered through the accounts of those with nothing to hide. At some point, this cost was something like 30%.
Which means that Demonetisation had a redistributive effect. About 30% of the black money got redistributed to those involved in the money laundering transactions, many of them poor. And the balance got converted into legitimate money.
People do not appreciate losing any part of their income. Which is why they do not pay taxes. So being forced to surrender about 30% of the cash makes the class of cash-holders very upset with the government and its political leadership.
What Demonetisation achieved was to bring about a change in the support base of the ruling BJP. The traders who traditionally supported the BJP and hoarded cash have turned lukewarm, but the poor, who have mostly voted the BJP only in anger against the Congress, see it is a party that hits the rich where it hurts them the most, and therefore, is a party of the poor.
Demonetisation, in essence, was a clever way of using the class anger of the poor against the rich to shore up political support for Modi and his party. Will that support evaporate, if it is demonstrated that this claim of championing the poor was built on false premises, that Demonetisaton did little to remove black money? That depends on getting the message home to the people at large.
Popular communication has been Modi’s forte and that of his party with its hundreds of thousands of Whatsapp groups and their incessant propagation of news, fake and real.
