Imprisonment of Ven. Gnanasara Thera
Most Ven.Ittapane Mahayanayake writes to President

Mahayanayake of the Kotte Sri Kalyani Samagri Maha Sangha Sabha Most Ven. Ittapane Dhammalankara Thera in a letter addressed to President Maithripala Sirisena on Monday said that the offence that is said to have been committed by the General Secretary of Bodu Bala Sena Organization Ven.Galagodaatte Gnanasara Thera at the Homagama Courts was not committed to achieving a personal benefit.
The Mahanayake Thera in his letter to the President over the imprisonment of Ven.Ganasara Thera said that if the Buddhist monks who speak on behalf of the country and the people are imprisoned, it would pose a challenge to the entire Bhikkhu community
Excerpts from the letter:”It is our responsibility to express some sentiment with regard to Ven. Galagodaathte Gnanasara Thera, since he belongs to the Kotte Sri Kalyani Samagri Maha Sangha Sabha. Since the court proceedings regarding him are not over, we would not delve into it. Therefore, our Sangha Sabha has decided to bring the following points to the attention of the President.
“From ancient times, the Sri Lankan Bhikkhu was a character that always stood and fearlessly spoke for the country and for the benefit of the wider society.
“If the Buddhist monks who speak on behalf of the country and the people are imprisoned it would pose a challenge to the entire Bhikkhu community.
“We would like to further state that the Kotte Sri Kalyani Samagri Maha Sangha Sabha stands for the country as well as for all communities and religions and highly values justice and fairness”.
