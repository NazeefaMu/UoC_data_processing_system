‘Indian govt open to foreign  airline taking stake in Air India’

The Indian government may not be averse to the prospect of allowing overseas carriers to bid for stakes in Air India, according to a senior government official.
“This (sale to foreign airlines) was one of the options suggested in the presentation made to the ministerial panel by the aviation secretary,” said the official.
“The ministerial panel did not object to the idea of a foreign partner for the national carrier and foreign airlines could be allowed to bid for the national carrier.”
The discussion took place last Friday at the first meeting of the panel led by finance minister Arun Jaitley that’s looking into possible options for Air India’s disinvestment. Others at the meeting included aviation minister Ashok Gajapati Raju, power minister Piyush Goyal and railway minister Suresh Prabhu.
Analysts said Air India would fetch a fair price if overseas airlines are allowed to bid for it.
“Foreign airline equity participation up to 49% in AI’s divestment will be critical to achieve a successful outcome for the government,” said Kapil Kaul, CEO, CAPA South Asia. “Restricting foreign airlines will send a wrong signal globally and significantly constrain the number of interested bidders."
The aviation ministry is said to be working on various options, one of which could be to sell assets and subsidiaries to clear the working capital debt but some analysts said this may not be the right way to go.
“Each asset sold would make the airline less lucrative for the prospective buyer,” said Amrit Pandurangi, former director at Delloitte and an aviation analyst. “The government should look at other means to address this debt and not by selling the subsidiaries of the airline.”
