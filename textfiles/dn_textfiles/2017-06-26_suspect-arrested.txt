Suspect arrested

The suspect in the alleged murder of Sempukutti Arachchige Tarindi Aloka (26), the daughter of a billionaire businessman residing at 162/2 Horana Road, Kottawa, was arrested when he surrendered to police through a lawyer, a spokesman for the Kottawa police said.
Tarindi, who was a past pupil of Dharmapala Vidyalaya, Kottawa, and Sujatha Vidyalaya, Colombo, had a sister studying at Dharmapala Vidyalaya, Kotte.
Police said Tarindi's parents had a shop in the Kottawa town.
The suspect who had a love affair with Tarindi had come to her house on June 21 and slept in the third floor, while Tarindi slept in the second floor.
The following morning the parents had left to the shop and her sister had left for the school.
When she returned and called for her elder sister, she had not answered.
When she went into Tarindi's room she had seen her lying dead in a pool of blood and informed the parents who alerted the police.
Police said the suspect had allegedly stabbed Tarindi with a knife he had brought after an argument between the two and CCTV cameras had recorded him leaving the house around 9 am and boarding a bus.
Homagama District Judge and Magistrate Sudesh Ranatunga held the magisterial inquiry into the death.
The suspect was due to be produced before the Homagama magistrate.
Police investigations are continuing.
