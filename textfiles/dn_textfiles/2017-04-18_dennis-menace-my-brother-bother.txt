Dennis the Menace my brother the bother!

Dennis, the menace, he's a bundle of dynamiteOh, the things he says and the things he doesWill make you shake with fright(Beware of) Dennis the menaceThey never know what will happen nextA cyclone, flood or rotDennis the menace, though he makes your hair turn grayHe'll steal your heart awayLast night I got a spankingI don't know what to think'Cause all I did was fill my water pistol full of ink
I believe it was about two weeks ago that I wrote about how kids were encouraged by a popular comic strip in the 50s to make contact with their inner Dennis the Menace image. I also mentioned that my slightly older sibling whose name Denis is spelt with a single ‘n’ was far more menacing than his comic book counterpart as a kid.
Long before the Beatles were invading America, and astronauts were walking on the moon, both the fictional Dennis as well as his Sri Lankan counterpart were wreaking havoc on everyone in their neighbourhoods. Despite changes in the social and political landscapes things remained pretty much the same in both Dennises’ little universes.
All in all, the 50s were a very adventurous decade for us kids! To tell the truth I was no alabaster saint either during that era. Coincidentally the sibling Denis was around the same age as the American cartoonist Hank Ketcham’s pint-sized hero when he first hit the news-stands. It was synchronously a sort of unexpected phenomenon. However, it did occur and in a universe as big as ours strange coincidences are bound to happen.
As I explained in my last column the comic book Dennis was the archetypal badly behaved schoolboy with a touch of innocence that appealed to readers. I must admit that my brother Denis, the bane of my childhood life, was far more anarchical and riotous in his outlook than his comic book counterpart.
Brother Denis was chubbier at the time than any of the De Rosayro siblings and was regarded by my mother as her angelic offspring. In her eyes at the time he could have got away with cold-blooded murder and she would have pleaded culpable homicide in any court of law on his behalf to get him off the hook, or the hangman’s noose.
But he couldn’t pull the wool over my martinet grandfather’s eyes who sarcastically referred to him as ‘the angel child’. My mother and his kindergarten and primary school teachers assumed he was good because of his cherubic looks and extremely fair complexion. Ok sure, he could turn on an innocent, compassionate and virtuous look when he got into all kinds of scrapes and was let off scot free when he should have been subjected to horrific punishments.
I was quite chagrined when he was often chosen during the kindergarten Christmas concerts to be cast in the role of an angel. I was always cast, in what I imagined was the less starring role as the narrator. How a delinquent roughneck fitted into the character of an angel was beyond my comprehension.
But I must admit that he was a darned good soccer player in addition to being an accomplished pugilist. When it came to sports we played them all. Cricket, soccer and boxing in season or out were anytime and anywhere games. And we taught ourselves the finer points of all these games with no adult coaching guiding us. By the time we formed a pre-teenage club we ran circles around adult men’s clubs while we were equipped with real ‘footer’ and cricket boots. Despite my brother Denis’ objections I played in the left-striker position and to his mortification was the chief goal-scorer on most occasions.
If the truth be told his passes were fairly accurate and his tackling of bigger opponents mean. He set me up for most of the strikes. His problem was that being an incurable show-off he tried to be everywhere on the field at the same time although he was supposed to be a centre-forward. In later years he played college and club soccer at the highest level and was picked for the national youth team.
He was also renowned as the family prize fighter and defended his siblings and cousins with fierce opposition even from bigger and heavier antagonists. But he never lost precious time in holding grudges. His philosophy: “Don't ever hold a grudge, ... Just belt them and forget about it.” When my mother was expecting my kid sister Ann who was about five years younger than he was and wanted another brother he consoled me saying: “Havin' a sister might not be too bad... 'specially if she's trained to kick people in the shins when you're losing a fight.”
He was a spectator when I took on a bigger bully in a fight at school. He sidled up to me and gave me some of his expert bashing advice: “Get the first shot in ... and afterwards there will be separation.” I followed his advice to the letter and gave my opponent an unexpected straight left on his kisser. He bled profusely but sure enough the separation came soon after and I was hailed as a hero.
From an academic point of view I considered Denis as not being the brightest bulb on the family Christmas tree. His early primary school reports had him nearly at the bottom of his class, while I managed to remain at the middle of the rung. But that was only until he was around eight when he fell off a tree, we were all rough-housing on. He was rushed to hospital and remained unconscious for a couple of hours. Following the fall we were both enrolled in a new school. And astonishingly his report cards revealed he was mostly at the top of his class, proving that a fall could both damage one’s brain and reversely perk it up as well.
Well, Dennis the Menace cartoon character was created over 60 years ago — so obviously our little Denis has grown up quite a bit! He's some three score and ten or so now and he's just as insufferable as he was when he was a kid! So there you have it, Our Denis the Menace is all grown up. Makes you feel old doesn’t it?
