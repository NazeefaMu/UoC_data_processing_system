Citizens' Mail

Strengthen their spine, not the schoolbag!
Not a single schoolchild is spared from the unnecessary burden of the schoolbag on their back. There is a simple solution to this problem as stated below. The textbook can be easily broken into three parts according to the syllabus of each term. Why carry the study material for the third term syllabus from January itself like a “silly-bus”?
The mother who is fully in charge of the child’s school matters, homework, arranging private tuition etc. is clever enough to work on this solution. She can break the textbook into three parts according to the syllabus of each term. The last page of each part can be photocopied and pasted making it a complete book for each term, with a homemade cover. When the time comes for reprinting, three books can be printed separately to coincide with the three terms. Smaller bag can be made with thick cotton material instead of thick canvass material used now.
The entire student population in the whole country will be benefited and parents and teachers too will, at last, find some consolation over this burning issue.
Then, the bulky exercise books can be replaced with smaller ones thus reducing the weight further. Yes, father has got to earn ‘money’ which is a huge task and no time or peace of mind to attend to the ‘child’. A wise mother knows it well and that’s why ‘no objection’ to whatever he is doing!
All the school principals and parent-teacher associations are kindly invited to join hands in promoting this proposal to our dear minister for necessary action.
