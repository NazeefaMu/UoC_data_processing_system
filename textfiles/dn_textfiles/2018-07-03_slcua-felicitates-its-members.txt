The Sri Lankan Cricket Umpires’ Association (SLCUA) held its Felicitation Night at the Global Towers in Wellawatte last Saturday (23) under the patronage of distinguished cricket personalities and local umpires.
The SLCUA holds its felicitation ceremony with the intention of encouraging its current members and drawing in new recruits as cricket umpires. At the ceremony closer to 100 members were felicitated for their yeomen services bestowed as umpires for the game of cricket.
Presently the SLCUA has a strong membership of closer to 100 experienced and budding umpires, with many of them being youngsters who are training under the watchful eyes of the veterans of the trade namely D.N. Pathirana, J.W.K. Boteju and E.K.G. Wijewardhana. The President of SLCUA, Ashrof Ghany, at the felicitation ceremony stated the importance of being disciplined and unbiased at matches to safeguard the reputation of cricket umpires.
“It's an honour to have veteran coach Mr. Nelson Mendis as the Guest of Honour, it's encouraging to have a personality like him to further boost the energy of our members. Mr. Mendis is known for producing top quality cricketers to the country, and it's a privilege to have him here to further enhance our umpires with his vast knowledge in cricket,” Ghany stated.
Ghany further went on to say that the SLCUA is making all possible moves to encourage youngsters and newcomers to take up cricket umpiring. The SLCUA has an elite panel of experienced international and first class umpires, who are fully committed to train the newcomer, added Ghany.
“An umpire should be well educated of the updating cricket laws, be neutral, unbiased and always ready to handle the pressure. At SLCUA, we are helping our members, specially the youngsters to adhere to those values,” he added.
The SLCUA currently officiates matches conducted mainly by Mercantile Cricket Association, Nationalized Services Cricket Association, State Services Cricket Association, Colombo District Cricket Association and other encounters, in particular friendly games played against visiting foreign teams.
The event was planned to be held under the patronage of Colombo Mayor, Rosy Senanayake, but the chief guest could not attend it due to a personal reason and she was represented by her sister Shereen Massilamani and the Personal Secretary Sandra Thomas. The Guest of Honour veteran cricket coach Nelson Mendis took over the proceedings as the chief guest in the absence of Ms. Senanayake and delivered an inspiring speech. “I commend the commitment of Mr. Ghany, who had been heading the Nationalized Services Sports Federation and the Nationalized Services Cricket Association. Under him the two associations achieved a lot and he has moved forward with his commitment with the SLCUA as well.
The entity has been helping produce umpires to the country and I'm proud to be here, to talk to these persons who stand there in the middle under varying conditions and help the game take a neat flow,” Mendis stated, before personally talking to each member of the SLCUA.
The SLCUA has been conducting this programme to felicitate the umpires regularly mainly to recognise the services of the local cricket umpires who have contributed towards the SLCUA.
