Moratuwa students to showcase creation in UK

A group of Moratuwa University Mechanical Engineering students have been chosen to showcase their creation; a 650CC racing car at the international Formula Student races to be held in Silverstone, UK this year.
Silverstone, which is the home of British racing will have the students for the second time in a row introduce their new prototype, DI-MORA P2.
The event will be held from July 11-15. The students recently introduced their car at the Mercedes Benz 800 Exhibition, organized by DIMO Lanka Pvt Ltd. The students are being financially supported by DIMO.
Formula Student races are held once every two years and in 2016 too, the Moratuwa University students participated in the races with their prototype DI-MORA P1. It won three awards on the occasion; ‘Best newcomer in Class 1, ‘Best Individual Driver’ and Dedication to Formula Student’.
The students have named their team; Team Shark and have built the car using raw materials used in aircrafts. The DI-MORA P2, weighs 195kg whilst in 2016 it weighed 300kg. Further, the car has a 3 cylinder 650CC engine and runs on a paddle-shift transmission to reach 100km/hr in 3.5 sec.
Students who do well in the Formula Student races are later given the opportunity to work in prominent car companies around the world; including the official Formula 1 races.
