MR boasts about what he has not done: Thalatha

Justice and Foreign Affairs Minister Thalatha Atukorale says former President Mahindea Rajapaksa has said that he had constructed the Rajagiriya Fly Over and planned the Moragahakanda Project.
She was addressing a political rally held in Ratnapura for the support of the UNP candidates in the LG polls.
She said one person told on the TV that she was formulating laws to send several opponents to prison for 20 years. "I am a lawyer myself and I know regulations of the country very well. We know that judiciary is superior to every other institutions," she said.
She said she did not work just like Mahinda did in his tenure hiding files and punishing only those who went against him. "He put under the carpet the files of Nanda Ellawala's murderers and now those details come out. Now we have gone past that era. We respect the people's freedom more than the power that we have now. Some ask us what we have done for the last two years. But they know by heart that they enjoy more freedom and political fairness now," the Minister said.
She said the government did not promote politics of slogans. "We do not hold entertainments spending the public money in millions. We do not hold inauguration festivities just like Mahinda and clan did in their duration spending millions of rupees on unnecessary propaganda campaigns," she said.
She said the UNP government has initiated a high number of development programmes since J.R. Jayewardene's era and beyond. "We do not have to put new hoardings to show our activities to develop the country. What we have done so far is more than enough to put the public on our stead," she said. "Mahinda Rajapaksa is now attempting to put our Prime Minister in blame. If anyone can prove the Prime Minister is guilty for any wrong, I will resign from my ministerial post. We witnessed what MR did during his time destructing the assets of the country. Thieves think that everyone seeks power to steal. Murderers think they need power to kill," the Minister said.
The Minister said the President has the power in accordance with the Constitution to appoint a commission to investigate any complaint.
"Commission is not a court. A man can be sentenced only by a court if that man was proven guilty," the Minister said.
Minister Atukorale said they had not stolen a cent from others.
"The cases against those corrupted delayed because the judicial system has as many as 650,000 cases to finish. Magistrates cannot finish all the cases they have at once. It takes time. That is why the cases delayed," the Minister said.
She said the public can ask to accelerate hearing cases and the government would respond to that request. Then we will arrange a way to accelerate the system and hear cases daily. "We have done enough for the two years; we do not have to exaggerate," the Minister said.
