Memorial Centre in Japan for late President Jayewardene

A memorial centre in memory of the late President J. R. Jayewardene will be built in the Gunma Prefecture in Japan under the patronage of Pelpola Vipassi Foundation President, Japan-Sri Lanka Cultural Friendship Association President, International Pelpola Buddhist Vihara Chief Incumbent and Chief Sangha Nayaka of Japan Ven. Pelpola Vipassi Thera.
The Japanese people still remember with gratitude the late President Jayewardene who appealed to the international community at the Japanese Peace Treaty Conference in San Francisco in 1951 as the then Finance Minister to forgive Japan and help it develop.
The J. R. Jayewardene Memorial Centre will exhibit the San Francisco speech as well as pictures from his life and political career.
“This will benefit the next generation in Japan,” Ven. Pelpola Vipassi Thera said, adding that discussions are now underway with the Japanese government to include the late President’s speech into Japanese school textbooks. The Thera said the International Pelpola Vipassi Buddhist Temple and pilgrims’ rest will also be constructed in addition to the J. R. Jayewardene Memorial Centre in a six-acre mountainous land in Gunma.
The Gunma prefecture is important to the Japanese people as it is the birth place of Japanese Empress Michiko and four former Prime Ministers. It is a beautiful, mountainous and agricultural area located at the centre of Japan.
The proposed J. R. Jayewardene centre is surrounded by a highway, a road, railway station and bullet train line. This will be built with the support of well-wishers in Sri Lanka and Japan.
Those who wish to help this project can obtain information from Ven. Pelpola Vipassi Thera by calling 0112698184 in Sri Lanka and 0479-74-3844 in Japan.
