Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+ unveiled

The eagerly-awaited Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+, from Samsung Electronics will now be available in Sri Lanka. The two latest models have reimagined the way people communicate, share and experience the world by providing all the features you’ve ever wished for in your smartphone but never had.
Understanding consumers’ need to share, communicate and express themselves more with images, videos and emojis, the Galaxy S9 and S9+ drive innovation with Samsung’s advanced camera.
Managing Director of Samsung Sri Lanka HanBae Park, said “In an age where individualism is constantly being expressed through images, emojis and video content, we have reimagined a smartphone for the future, with the Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9 +. Samsung Sri Lanka recently won People’s Youth Choice brand of the year award which reflects the growing popularity of Samsung amongst the people of Sri Lanka.”
The Galaxy S9 and S9+ deliver an enhanced entertainment experience with powerful stereo speakers tuned by AKG.
Super Slow-mo: Make every day moments epic with dynamic, slow-motion video that captures 960 frames per second. The Galaxy S9 and S9+ also offer automatic Motion Detection, an intelligent feature that detects movement in the frame and automatically begins to record.
Low Light Camera: Good lighting is the secret to any great photo. But often, photos are taken in less-than-ideal lighting conditions and most smartphone cameras have a fixed aperture that can’t adjust to low or bright lighting environments resulting in grainy or washed out pictures.
Samsung’s intelligence platform, integrated into the camera, uses augmented reality and deep learning technologies to provide helpful information about a user’s surroundings.
The Galaxy S9 and S9+ also support Dolby Atmos, giving the effect of 360-degree sound and its audio experience is complemented by Samsung’s revolutionary Infinity Display.
Samsung sets the gold standard for smartphones with IP68 water and dust resistance and wireless charging and goes a step beyond with the Galaxy S9 and S9+.
In addition, the Galaxy S9 and S9+ give users the peace of mind knowing that Knox 3.1, Samsung’s latest defence - grade security platform, protects their phone.
The Galaxy S9 and S9+ take health to the next level with an improved optical sensor built directly into the device, providing richer, more accurate information on users’ health status. This sensor allows the Galaxy S9 and S9+ to keep track of users’ Heart Load Factor, a new measurement of the real-time demand placed on the heart.
