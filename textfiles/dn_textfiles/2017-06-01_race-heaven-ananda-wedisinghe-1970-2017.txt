A race to Heaven: Ananda Wedisinghe 1970-2017

Motocross star Ananda Wedisinghe has been laid to rest in his hometown of Kurunegala after losing his life following an accident at last month’s Nuwara Eliya Road races.
I’ve raced with Ananda for many years and I would say he is “Fast, fearless and unforgiving on the racetrack”. Ananda was the most generous person I’ve ever known and his personality completed the image of a motorsport maverick.
The 47-year-old sadly joins many of those from an earlier time who paid the ultimate price for pursuing their motorsport dreams. One glance at Ananda indicated he didn’t live an ordinary life, unlike most of us; the big hearted Lankan also made a close connection with fans around the country and definitely was the most popular character in the racing arena.
My two sons were also privileged to race against Ananda, and often told me that he would attack each corner like he was trying to go faster than ever before and battled furiously for every position. Nothing was given away and every chance was taken on gravel as well as road racing circuits.
The downside was he had too many accidents and had many pins and plates attached to his bones and never wanted to give up racing.
Ananda’s demise would not be easy for us, and I feel so sad about his beloved wife, 4 kids and the 4 grand children he leaves behind as he rides off to heaven.
Enjoy your ride Bro.
