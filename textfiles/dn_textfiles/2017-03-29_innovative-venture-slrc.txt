Senior dubbing artiste and actor Kamal Deshapriya said, “SLRC has embarked on a noble venture by introducing Hawasata Gedera program. The right program has to be aired at the right time and selecting the primetime belt to telecast Hawasata Gedera is a wise move. This is a significant change in SLRC’s program lineup.”
Deputy IGP Ajit Rohana said mass media’s use of slang and improper language is very damaging and it has to be rectified. He said television channels harp on violence and in news too violence is highlighted.
“I commend SLRC’s initiative with ‘Hawasata Gedera’ towards making a sensible individual via television culture”, he said.
Veteran journalist Thilekeratne Kuruvita Bandara said local television is fast distancing from its viewers due to blunders of TV channels. He commended Hawasata Gedera as a good program with variation, aired at the right time.
